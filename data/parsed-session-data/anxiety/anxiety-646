<b>DAPHNE LONEY GETS ME</b>.


She lives in New Orleans and she doesn't know me but she totally
gets me. She makes sculptures about the psychology of personal space.
Her titles clap and stomp to the awkward beat of my hot-coal dance
around boundaries.


DEVICE THAT ATTRACTIVELY PREVENTS PHYSICAL CONTACT FROM
STRANGERS, FRIENDS, AND FAMILY. DEVICE THAT PREVENTS ANYONE
FROM COMPULSIVELY HUGGING YOU. APPARATUS THAT ENABLES ONE
TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF CONFIDENCE WHILE CAUSING YOURSELF DISCOMFORT.
They are metal collars. Wire. Copper. Glass.


I tape a picture of one of these sculptures on my office door as a
way of warning my colleagues and supervisors and students in advance.
I am hard to get close to. I put this fact on blast as if it's something to be
proud of. As if it's funny.

Large spent bullet shells jut out from the neck.<br />
A magnifying glass curves upwards towards the face<br />
of the woman wearing the collar. One collar extends<br />
down the chest with a plate of metal bearing two-foot<br />
long extensions ending in a thick protruding nail.


Everything about me sends the same message. Intimacy hurts.
I dare you to kiss me anyway.


I INVITE EMILY to my place and all the surfaces glitter. The table
is covered in crystal candlestick holders and stemmed glassware for
three different kinds of alcohol. I have created a glistening surface for
my life as a defense against chronic depression. Emily calls the condo
my bachelorette pad. She sees the life of the single girl as one long
afternoon without obligations, but I've been single most of my adult
life and I miss the sensation of belonging with someone. The condo is
less MEDITATION RETREAT than REFUGEE CAMP or TRIAGE STATION.


I fear Emily sees me as defective <i>you're not in touch with any of your
exes? you tell everyone everything! that bitch Penny Moss turned you into a
goat</i> so I drench the atmosphere in the erotic. I do this. Turn critics into
lovers. Afterwards, when we still don't get along, I am mystified by my
failed attempt to neutralize conflict by merging with its source.

Emily had flirted with me in an email message <i>you looked fabulous
in your green scarf</i> and I want to appear open and unfazed. I come to the
door in a low-cut satin tank top lined with black lace. I compliment her
thin silk sweater <i>très chic! c'est chouette!</i> and embrace her like we are
Parisian. I delay the kiss with Emily so long she says, "This is silly. I'm
going home." After hours of strained flirtation I press my closed lips to
her closed lips and wait to see what happens.


THE MATCH IGNITES.


THE UNCONSCIOUS FALLS IN LOVE.


THE CHANCE OF A POSITIVE OUTCOME IS<br />
SLIM INDEED.


<b>THE KISS IS NOT MAGICAL.<br />
THE KISS IS CHEMICAL</b>.


The life we knew before no longer exists. We have abandoned the
present and joined hands as traveling companions in a novel of seduction
set in the distant past.


We read the book like the pages are on fire.

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WHEN I WAS a teenager in rural Georgia I never thought I'd get the
chance to kiss a girl.


I fantasized about it as early as fifteen after stumbling across a
classic lesbian coming-of-age novel called <i>Rubyfruit Jungle</i> in a local
bookstore, but I couldn't imagine how it would ever happen. No one
in my high school was out. The only lesbian I knew was old and unattractive.
I had private crushes on girls and channeled the sexual energy
into my boyfriend.


The year after my divorce I didn't want to sleep alone at night and
didn't care whose body curled behind mine as I drifted off, so I opened
myself to new sexual possibilities.


That spring I date a married couple about eight years older than me.
We go from a bar to my rented house and listen to music in my bedroom.
The three of us sit in a row on the edge of my bed like school
children. Tad, the husband, sits in the middle. He tells me to kiss his
wife. I can't imagine what will happen when our lips touch. I have
been raised to believe our parts won't fit. I picture a Plexiglas window
popping up between us. Soon I am more interested in Julia than
her husband even though he was the one who initially attracted me.
I love kissing Julia and I hate lying in bed with Tad while she showers
for work. I am uncomfortable and I can't tell how much of the

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I see them in a record store the following spring,<br />
I WALK THE OTHER WAY.


Over the next decade I will have a string of one-night stands with
women to remind myself I'm attracted to women and to prove I'm not
afraid of this attraction.


<b>THE TRUTH IS<br />
THE ATTRACTION SCARES ME A LOT</b>.


"I think you're a lesbian," my younger sister Jessica tells me one
day when I'm in my mid-twenties. She came out in high school after I
asked her advice about whether I should tell my boyfriend that I kissed
my friend Kate. Her first reaction was panic. She started sobbing and
hung up on me, but soon she admitted she was gay and shot past me in
achieving the markers of lesbian legitimacy—dating women, developing
a circle of friends who two-step at lesbian bars, meeting the love of her
life on Myspace and moving to Massachusetts to marry her—while I
kept sex with girls safely outside my sense of real life.

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'M NOT A LESBIAN," I tell her.


I confine LESBIAN to the blur of late night margins. I insist LESBIAN
is all lark and dare for me.


I am in love with a man named Jack when we have this conversation
—a man who cooks for me, slices oranges for me, drinks whiskey
from a bottle in the tub with me, pins me to the wall of his bedroom
by my wrists and pounds his body into mine until I scream from the
intensity—and the awkward nights in bed with my stripper friends and
graduate school girlfriends pale in comparison.


"DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S BECAUSE YOU KEEP MAKING OUT WITH
STRAIGHT WOMEN?" ASKS JESSICA.


The question gives me pause but mostly I still feel like an imposter.
I don't know what lesbians do in bed. I don't want to be revealed as remedial.
My sister told me to draw the alphabet with my tongue between
Emily's legs, but the plan does not leave me relaxed or confident.


I am still unsure of my sexual orientation and I fear my lesbian
lark may end in social exile.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I need to renew my bisexual street cred," I joke to my sister, even
though my real feelings are not this breezy or superficial. I don't want
to overstate my claim to same-sex desire at this time for at least three
separate reasons.


• <i>I don't want to look like a poser</i>.


• <i>I don't want to find myself in over my head</i>.


• <i>And I don't want to be rejected</i>.


I can no more imagine Emily wanting me than my lady professor
of British Lit years ago, the one who hosted cookouts at her house
for English majors each spring. I stayed late into the night talking
books and grad school on her patio, prolonging my access to her
home life and leisure hours. In class I studied the poem of her face
while she lectured on the literary meanings of fruitwet woman bodies 
and said things like <i>brothels are built with the bricks of religion
and prisons with the stones of law</i>. THAT'S HOT. I had a crush
on her <i>and</i> her husband. My feelings fell in the overlapping spaces
between wanting to be them, wanting to sex them, and wanting to be
claimed by them as their brilliant adopted daughter.


Emily is equally out of my league, always put together just so in
slacks, silk blouses, and sharp-toed shoes brought to you by the letter
V. She owns a house! She makes pasta salads! Emily is nine years older
than I am. She has a partner. They have a daughter. I'm not a lesbian.
The odds are against an affair. Yet here she is, her lips pressed against my
lips, offering to stay the night.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't take her up on it.


I don't want to act on impulse.


I wait a week. I need to think through the pluses and minuses of
an affair with Emily. Number one in the minus column is the fact that
we're coworkers. I don't want to lose the comfort of campus. I like my
office and my department. I don't want to let the infatuation and chaos
of romance bleed into these clean spaces. Number one in the plus column
is the fact of external controls. Emily is in a long-term relationship
and her partner, Vanessa, is probably moving back to town in a few
months, so we will have to end the affair after a short period of exploration
and fun.


No hearts broken.


Just passing the time.


Before the first kiss, though, she asks if I'm flirting because I'm
bored and I say no. I say I'd be interested even if we lived somewhere
with lots of lesbians.


Both perceptions are true. I am interested in her. I am glad the
external controls will end the relationship. This structure feels safe. The
stakes are low. We won't have to consider the hard questions.


ARE WE COMPATIBLE? DO WE WANT TO DO THIS FOREVER?


<i>Do you love me as much as I love you? Should we move in together?</i>


<i>Will you always use this towel to wipe the counters in the kitchen and
leave this towel on the oven door just for drying clean hands?</i>

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We will not have to do algebraic equations of intimacy. Vanessa
will come back to town and take her away from me. Problem solved.
No reason to worry at evenly matching our levels of devotion.


I weave this logic into a security blanket.


Pull it snugly up to my chin.


After the first sexual encounter with Emily I feel a panic attack
coming on but I mask it so as not to be impolite. I get up to take some
sinus medication. I peel back the metal foil and swallow the pill but I
still can't breathe. Something is in the way.


The fine print on the box should give a warning.


PSEUDOEPHEDRINE IS NOT FDA-APPROVED FOR ENGULFMENT FEARS.


I am already thinking about how to extract myself from the situation.
Emily asks if she should leave and I say no. I smile reassuringly at
her and we snuggle together like peas in a pod. I fumble with invisible
straps and buttons and pull on a large imaginary metal collar so she won't
flow over my head and pull me out to sea. I close my mouth around a
tube and pull air through a too-narrow passageway, my untrained lungs
aching from the pressure.

<i>Laura Tuley calls Daphne Loney's metalcollar<br />

themselves in order to perform and function by<br />
the prevailing norms of feminine etiquette, and<br />
the ways women defend themselves from the toxic<br />
effects of these norms."</i>


<b>WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO?</b>


I'm afraid she's going to fall in love with me. I'm afraid she's going
to want me more than I want her. I'm afraid I'll turn cold and stop talking
to her and not be able to explain why. Emily draws circles on my
back with her fingertips until I feel calm but I never do go to sleep that
night. Before she leaves the next morning we make plans to see each
other the following weekend. And as I begin to breathe again in the
birdsong of daybreak part of me can't wait.

MY SISTER WAS RIGHT. Sex with a lesbian is better than sex with
straight girls. It is also better (for me) than sex with men. In bed with
Emily my body becomes a field of delight instead of the problem men
marked it—Woody Aliens, all of them, complaining in unison about
sore jaws—and I never leave the bed anymore without reaching orgasm.
The climax becomes one point in a wide circle of erotic energy that
passes from my body to hers and from hers back to mine, and I learn
what straight girls everywhere need to learn. Getting a girl off isn't that
difficult. And if his jaw hurts from how long it takes for you to get there,
he's doing it wrong. OR POSSIBLY YOU ARE GAY.


More than one boyfriend has recommended I seek medical treatment
for not getting wet like his other girlfriends, but I no longer fall
short in that area. I almost come from pushing my body towards her
body and listening to the sounds she makes in response. I hold her down
and press her body into the couch, moving my hips against her until she
gasps and closes her eyes.


I am exploring the subtle power dynamics of being a FEMME TOP.


I run the fuck.

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I practice LESBIAN like an intricate piece of sheet music for
advanced piano. I become aware of LESBIAN as something beyond orientation.
LESBIAN unfolds in me as ontology, epistemology, phenomenology,
and sexology. I stand in the South Carolina landscape with a wider
stance. I cut my fingernails short and walk with deliberate strides. I play
and laugh and roll around with her on the floor.


Emily and I abandon our real lives and glide across the water of our
lives as if the affair is a gondola and the world is our theme park. We are
silly and self-indulgent. We buy lacey panties and T-shirts with ironic
statements across the chest.


Mine says, TRUST ME.


Hers says, I DON'T GIVE A HOOT!


We buy gemstone earrings and get third holes pierced in our ears.
Emily makes me promise I will never take it out.


"I won't go if you don't promise."


So I promise. She puts one pink stud in her ear and I put one pink
stud in mine. We behave like eighth-graders exchanging BFF heart
necklaces for Christmas.


One broken half on one necklace. One broken half on the other.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WHEN WE HAVE SEX I think about Emily's partner.


Vanessa standing at the open door of Emily's bedroom while we
swirl and moan. Vanessa pulling into the driveway and catching us in
the act. Vanessa being forced to watch. Vanessa hurting. I stare at a
sepia-toned picture of Emily and Vanessa in a frame above the nightstand
and my pelvis rocks faster at the thought of trespass, my pleasure
a five-fingered discount.


When I leave Emily's house to rush to a meeting after a noonday
tryst in front of her closet mirror, I am so high on endorphins I can hardly
drive. My fingertips buzz with pleasure. It coats me like suntan oil.


The pinks of the blooming crepe myrtles are pinker than ever
before. I want to roll around in the petals piled beneath them. I want to
scoop them up in handfuls and shower Emily with them.


A woman on the radio sings, I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I
LOVE YOU. I turn the volume up and put my foot on the gas.

<i>Pseudo-love.<br />
If a person has not reached the level where she has a sense<br />
of l-ness rooted In the productive unfolding of her own powers,<br />
she tends to idolize the loved person. She is alienated from<br />
her own powers and projects them into the loved person</i>.


<i>The bearer of all love, all light, all bliss</i>.


<i>In this process she deprives herself of all sense of strength,<br />
loses herself in the loved one instead of finding herself. Since<br />
no person can live up to the expectations of her idolatrous<br />
worshiper, disappointment is bound to occur</i>.


Emily recommends a film—<i>you'll love it,</i> she says, <i>I can't wait to
hear what you think</i>—and in the cool dark plush of the theater I watch
men and women fall in love with each other and cheat on each other
and fall apart over each other like lesbians on television. I read it like a
love note in code.


"Do you know what a heart looks like?" Clive Owen bellows at
Jude Law.


"A FIST WRAPPED IN BLOOD!"

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The image is wonderful and gruesome and strange and I wonder
what Emily is trying to tell me. Clive Owen looks sort of like our colleague
Lyle. I personally think Lyle lingers in Emily's office too often.
When I roam down the hallway at work and knock on her office door
where I plan to flirt and moon, sometimes Lyle is already there. I think
Lyle should fuck off. I retreat and email Emily.


Instead of telling her I'm jealous I tell her about managing my jealousy.
I SEE THIS INDIRECTNESS AS SOPHISTICATION. <i>I rock the coy disguise
like oversized D&Gs; hiding peagreen eyes</i>.


Date: February 4, 2005<br />
To: Emily<br />
From: Lisa<br />
Conversation: film review


Dear Emily—<br />
I heard Jude Law say that <i>Closer</i> is about the fact that we only see
about 50% of the person with whom we are in a relationship and the
effort to force out the rest of a person's story/self/secrets is precisely
what destroys the relationship. I will therefore refrain from
forcing you to further reenact your conversation with Lyle. Instead
I will simply say I look forward to our own outing next weekend.
And to season two of <i>The L Word,</i> which is right around the corner.


xxoo—<br />
L

This is jealousy intellectual-style!


Meta-jealousy.


A discourse on jealousy. Anything but jealousy itself.


Jealousy itself would be gauche. Jealousy is so yesterday. I want to
be so TODAY I'm already TOMORROW. I want to be bigger than my jealousy.
I want to be above it.


I know insecurity is unattractive. I hate this side of me.


I don't really hate this side of me.


I think other people will hate it so I hate it preemptively to ward
off the unbearable feeling of having my shortcomings pointed out by
other people. I want to get there before anyone else and stake my claim
on hating my jealousy so no one else can.


Emily says jealousy is a perfectly normal feeling.


She lets me off the hook just like that.


<i>The collars are made of metal. Handcuffs.<br />
Cement block. Hysterical symptom.<br />
Everyone is subject to neuroses. Some of us are<br />
able to disguise them or wear them more attractively</i>.


"Remember," she emails me,"I love EVERYTHING about you."


I want to rest easy in her reassurance but I won't let myself. I
intend to outsmart the gamble of intimacy.


I put my money on FALSE every time.
