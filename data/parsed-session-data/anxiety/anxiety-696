BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:00:08).
THERAPIST: That's alright.
CLIENT: If that's the worst thing that happened to me this week I would be in good shape. So the car, the rental car, is like over a grand in damages. I have a $500 deductible. So I'm already one rental payment behind to my landlord so I don't know where I'm going to come up with this $500 and when or how I'm suppose to pay it. Uh-hmm, like right now I have no food in my house and really no money, neither the business account or my personal account and it's like two grand I'm in the hole right there, 1,900. I should be getting rent from the condo any day now which I could at least (pause at 00:01:10) keep only a month behind.
I found out this, Ian's birthday was Wednesday and we went to the museum to act and we're having a good time and then my mood just completely, you know, once I hear the voice message and we got back to the house I was just really snappy and a prick the rest of the night even with the dinner, ice cream and just every little thing was bothering me. You know, how you get this big huge cone that's, you know, weaving back and forth and I'm just like dude to hold it up. And he starts crying, I'm only a (inaudible at 00:01:53), you know, and just so what started out as a good day turned out to be not so good.
And then I uh-hmm come home and Buddy's out of the cage, he broke out of the cage again. But I'm noticing he has got blood on his face, he has got blood on his paw, there were spots of blood everywhere and I'm thinking that he just rips himself to shreds trying to get this metal off of his cage, right? So I'm all bummed about that, I'm just like I don't know what to do with this dog. I've got to, you know, it's like he's having serious separation anxiety and, you know, it's like I don't want to call the vet because I can't pay the vet, you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: There's no money to pay the vet. And so I wake up the next morning and I, you know, I go into the office, there's a chair in there to put my shoes on and I look and there's a window, I mean it's out of a horror film, just broken window with blood everywhere. (0:03:07)
THERAPIST: Oh my God.
CLIENT: So he broke out of the cage and then the way he cut himself up was not on the cage -
THERAPIST: But on the window.
CLIENT: - but on the window. And (inaudible at 00:03:18) a little bit because one of his pads he nicked off.
THERAPIST: Oh gosh.
CLIENT: So, you know I know I have to call the vet but my life is now, you know, run by where this dog can be, you know, it's like if it's a cold day I can't go anywhere because I can't leave him in the car, you know. I can't leave him at home, he has got separation anxiety, everything freaks him out and I can tell it's like and he hears the door shut and the door slam or, everything is just, he's just jumpy about everything and a new place and. I did some research online and it's like yeah, you know, moving to a new place is one of the things that causes the anxiety. And he's bit of a skittish dog to begin with. He used to just be afraid of the snow falling off the roof. But now it's like everything and, you know, not to blame the people I live with but, you know, you can hear everything that goes on, you know. And, you know, it's like I want to be really mad at him but he doesn't know what he's doing, you know. So, I don't know, I just don't even know what to do. I haven't even cleaned it up. I can't even get myself to go in there and clean it up. You know, and Jess is like call Dr. Canton (sp), call Dr. Canton and I'm like, I'm like yeah but I don't have any money. And she's like well he's very reasonable and like reasonable yeah, pay half now, pay half later that's still two halves I don't have. I mean, you know, a visit with him is 400 bucks, you know, minimum the tests and he's up for his yearly - (0:05:06)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - you know (pause at 0.05:09). And I finally had the closing on Monday.
THERAPIST: Oh good.
CLIENT: A cheap closing something like, I don't know, 4, I made like 6, $700 if that much, maybe I will make more, at the most $800, but, you know, I've got nothing else coming in, you know, I'm just. So just a miserable week and very difficult to, you know, I've got some titles to work on those, I've got to finish one of them today. And I've got to do my 1099's, which at least I figured out which files I need to do them on but I've like type those out. (inaudible due to noise on tape at [00:06:07] and a pause at 00:06:10). Just the pain, everything is a pain. Because like I don't want to call and ask my dad for money because I'm going to need him for the football tickets so I don't.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know. I know it sounds silly but, you know.
THERAPIST: Well, you're trying to allocate your, what you have got or some people get and you're (pause at [00:06:58] - 00:07:17). I think you probably feel a little like Buddy, I mean.
CLIENT: The dog?
THERAPIST: The dog.
CLIENT: I feel like shit.
THERAPIST: (Laughing) No, like the dog. I mean in that you're scared about what is going to hit you next and you're pretty much alone in all of this. (Pause at [00:07:41] - 00:07:54).
CLIENT: You know, as you said everything, it's like I can't find anything. It's like I want to be an I, you know, if there were ten people it would be an I, you know, people or what everybody has got an excuse why they can't make it, you know and it's just (inaudible at 00:08:10) but, you know, we need to be inducting a lot more then just one person. (Pause at [00:08:22] - 00:08:27). I don't know it's just nothing that seems to (pause [00:08:35] - 00:08:40), nothing that seems to be working. You know, you can a few bits of good news are just, you know. (Pause at [00:08:51] - 00:08:56). I'm running really low in the (inaudible at 00:08:57) account and so at some point I'm not going to put money in there. That's another, you know, hole, you know, eating through my bank account that I just, I can't keep up with. You know, if I bounce that I'm done. You know, because I have already bounced it once and I'm in trouble, I mean big time trouble if I bounce it again.
And, you know, Jess has got all of this money that she has been saving but, you know, she's saving it for the house so I really ... It's like I want to tell her I fucked up but, you know, and she's got like 10 or 11 grand. We hired a lawyer to help us with the IRS and you know, he said to take the money out of the bank account so that they can't take it. So, most of that ...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:10:08).
CLIENT: Yeah, most of it is tied up into a bank check payable to her, you know. So it's like even if I wanted to borrow money from her and (pause at [00:10:21] - 00:10:27), you know, I'm owed a little bit on some titles, I just got three titles in which will probably, seem like the kind of titles that will close this month.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: So that's three, you know, 500 bucks but that's, you know, it would be a nice month if that's going to come, you know. (Pause at [00:10:49] - 00:11:00) just dread everything. And when I called Jess, you know, it's like I just, I had to call her, I don't know, when I saw the, you know, the crime scene, literally I tried to take a picture of it, it didn't come out, I guess sunlight was coming through the window it didn't look as ominous as, maybe if I put it in black and white I don't know but. I don't think it really (pause at [00:11:38] - 00:11:44).
THERAPIST: That's pretty fucking ominous. Any of these special effects that ... it does look like a (inaudible at 00:11:53).
CLIENT: I haven't cleaned it up yet. It may put under the dust and fingerprint. (Pause at [00:12:07] - 00:12:11).
THERAPIST: Get any dust?
CLIENT: And, I don't know, I just, everything is bad news, you know, it's just (pause at [00:12:30] â€” 00:12:32). I don't think that I'm (inaudible at 00:12:33) or whatever that.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:35)?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's really that bad, you know. Oh, what I'm saying how, you know, I called Jess and I was just like really upset and she was actually for once sort of sympathetic and, you know.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Understanding that, you know, got all these pressures on me. (0:13:02)
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Which, I don't know, I mean, I don't know what the answer is for this dog, I can't, my landlord was pissed off the last time and then have been very nice about it, they haven't charged me for, they've been putting the windows back together themselves and only charge me for materials and, you know, they're like oh we love Buddy, you know, but he's destroying the place, you know. And they're on vacation until tomorrow, welcome back, by the way, there's a bloody window, you know. Jess says that Dr. Canton had talked about putting Buddy on Prozac before like. Yeah, and now there's one, you know, one more expense, you know, I can't, you know, use a co-pay for that. I've got to pay full price however much that is. (0:14:04)
THERAPIST: Are you going to like keep Buddy?
CLIENT: I have no choice, you know, I can't give him away. Jess won't take him. I mean the next stop is, you know, no one wants to a nine year old freaked out pit-bull, you know, there are not a lot of homes for dogs like that. And (pause at [00:14:29] - 00:14:34). I don't know have no choice really, you know. You know, he's peeved and had some issues at Jess's house but it's not as bad as, you know, him, he's not breaking windows there, you know, he's more comfortable there. Like he has got the couch there, his food, he's different, he senses home more there then he does at my place. (0:15:03)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And just I don't know he needs more exercise would help. Like everything he needs I'm unable to give him. You know, like I said now I've got to start taking him on long walks. He needs more exercise, you know, I don't know what to do, you know, if a really cold day comes up. You know, I can't leave him in the car and then when it starts getting hot I can't leave him in the car, you know. If I try and lock him in the rooms he scratches and, you know, takes the wood off the wall, you know. There is already one spot that he has done, my landlord doesn't know about and, I mean they're nice and all but at some point they're going to be like, you know, okay Evan this is, can't leave the dog alone. You know, I don't know if there's some, you know, I don't even have the money to buy a better crate if there is such a thing. I mean this thing is plastic all the way around it except for the door is metal and I don't, maybe if I push the crate up against the wall so he couldn't push the door open, you know, that that would. First I was worried, you know, it's kind of second look relief that he was cut up by the window because I thought he was cut up by the cage and then, you know, so now I know.
THERAPIST: Right, the cage isn't hurting him.
CLIENT: If I could some way keep him from opening that door, you know, I can. But this thing I read said the worse thing you can do to a dog with separation anxiety is crate him because that only makes it worse. And that's probably what happened, he just freaked out and there are dogs that do this, they try and get out through the windows, door and windows. And I can't afford a dog sitter, I can't afford a dog walker, I can't, I just, you know.
Like graham crackers and olives for dinner last night because that was all that was left. I can't afford to go grocery shopping. (Pause at [00:17:42] - 00:17:44). You know, I went to (pause at [00:17:47] - 00:17:51), the restaurant for dinner for Ian, that's his favorite place. Kids, like want to split the bill, I'm like, you know, really but couldn't afford to but I did, you know, I got cash and I gave her cash, 30 bucks, you know. I wasn't thinking I ordered something, you know, the chicken rib and I probably should have just gotten the chicken or the rib. (Pause at [00:18:28] - 00:19:18).
I forgot to take my medicine yesterday morning, just habit. (Pause at [00:19:29] - 00:19:32).
THERAPIST: Are you able to like think and do any work and try to problem solve around these kinds of things or are you too freaked out?
CLIENT: I don't know I mean like today I'm going to get my work done. I know I'll be able to do it. I am able to work. You know, it's just the (pause at [00:19:55] - 00:19:59). I don't know there's like I've got to call the insurance company, I've got to call the vet, with all these extra, I've got to call fucking Sharon at the farm it's like ... I've got all these things I've got to do that I don't want to do, you know. And it's not that I can't do them, I just I don't want to do them, you know. Sharon wants us to support the farm and I just can't do it, you know. And it's a fund raiser for the farm. And then she's going to want to (inaudible at 00:20:33), I don't know, that I'll have to look up and look into, you know.
THERAPIST: You want to be able to take care of these things. You want to be able to sort of do the right thing by Buddy or by the farm or by Jess or Web or.
CLIENT: You know if I was stressed out because I had, you know, too much work, you know, I could live with that, you know. Looking back to, you know, December, November, December of 2010 where, you know, I was really stressed out by the house but I had a lot of work and that kind of kept me semi-sane that, you know, I could at least focus on getting work done, stay away at the office getting work done. You know, Jess is thinking that I'm cheating on her, you know. (Pause at [00:21:35] - 00:21:37). Yes I was drinking whiskey. But, you know, I didn't have to worry about the money to some degree. Where it's like, you know, God if I just had that type of business and now, you know, a couple closings a week (pause at [00:21:58] - 00:22:03), I would be in a much better place, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I could get my car fixed, which I still haven't done. Just, you know, just waiting on pins and needles from Chase for the modification, you know, and I'm more worried about just Jess getting upset then I am about being turned down for the modification. You know, and having to listen to her, you know, cry that she's not going to be able to live in the house and she's going to have to move, you know. And, (pause at [00:22:48] - 00:22:52). So I do feel responsible for that. So that always bothers me when she says that stuff it's like there's a choice after modification is repayment plan which we have to pay for half of the payments, you know, we're probably going to (inaudible at 00:23:12). I'm confident that we could borrow the money from my step mom to make up the (inaudible at 00:23:19).
THERAPIST: Partial payment?
CLIENT: Partial payment, yeah. But they, not only do you have to make your normal payment but you've got to make up a payment towards payments you previously owed, you know. (Pause at [00:23:41] - 00:23:43). And I wish they would have done that last time, I don't know if we could have done it but, you know, our payment wouldn't have gone up. You know that's the problem, it just (pause at [00:23:56] - 00:23:59). And I don't know how long I'm suppose to stay, you know, in this place. There's someone who is interested in buying our condo, I don't know that he has inside of it but his brother-in-law owns the condo right next to it and (pause at [00:24:24] - 00:24:28) it will probably be listed by next week. Today they're taking pictures of the clutter. (Pause at [00:24:34] - 00:24:39). We filed answers to their condo lawsuit which denying things you know are true. I was not very comfortable with that. People do it, they always do it in answers, they deny. (Pause at [00:25:00] - 00:25:04). I don't know. (Pause at [00:25:07] - 00:25:22).
So the good news is ...
THERAPIST: Is that a question?
CLIENT: Well, hopefully I thought it would be a statement but I get this in Jess's family this weekend seeing this is Lucille's birthday party. (Pause at [00:25:41] - 00:25:45) Which I have to get Jess's mom to give me a shot of B12 which I haven't had in awhile. I'm wondering how that's affecting my health. You store it for a long period of time but when you're low it can cause like nervous system damage or.
THERAPIST: Oh really. (0:26:07)
CLIENT: You know, I'm kind of been wondering to myself if that's what's causing the low blood pressure, you know. I don't know I haven't had any incidents with that. I still get a little lightheaded but nothing to where I'm falling down and passing out. (Pause at [00:26:29] - 00:27:05). The life insurance guy, I'm being honest, referred me to the guy who does the mortgages at Community Bank, whatever, but he has got guys he's happy with. So it's like here's another, you know, I mean everything is an opportunity just to meet someone, get to know them, you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I do it but (pause at [00:27:33] - 00:27:36).
THERAPIST: But it didn't really turn into much?
CLIENT: No because they got the attorneys they are happy with, you know. (Pause at [00:27:46] - 00:27:48). You know, I lucked out briefly when things first got bad in a way because there were, people were laying off their staffs and lawyers who were use to having paralegals do the work and staffs were fucking up in customer service because they got rid of everybody. (0:28:12)
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: But, you know, the market has kind of adjusted and, you know, lawyers are back up to speed, you know, and I'm not running into that as much as I had been, you know. And (pause at [00:28:30] - 00:28:33). I don't have the personality to woo people, you know, I just, it's not in my make up. (Pause at [00:28:43] - 00:28:49). I don't think I can take another crappy year like last year, you know. (Pause at [00:28:55] - 00:29:05). Having these titles make a difference. It will probably be an extra 10 to 15 grand this year for me but.
THERAPIST: Well, that's something.
CLIENT: Yeah. Jess has got to have a good year. She's getting lots of calls and she's getting some new clients but she refuses to do Franklin County, you know. (Pause at [00:29:31] - 00:29:37). Because the drive, she drives up, you know, waste the whole day basically driving up and meeting with a client and driving back and, you know. What do you think I fucking do every day, you know? (Pause at [00:29:52] - 00:29:55). I don't know she's slightly in a different position because she has got the kids and (inaudible at 00:29:59) to do but. You know she's not in the position to be able to turn away business, you know. (Pause at [00:30:10] - 00:31:11). So how was your week? (Pause [00:31:12] - 00:31:17).
THERAPIST: Are these like a bunch of your worst of fears pretty much coming through?
CLIENT: Pretty much. It seemed like just everything, nothing seems to be getting better, you know, I'm still spiraling, you know, and (pause at [00:31:41] - 00:31:46) not even really quite kind of sure how I got into the, so far behind with my mortgage payment, you know, because he lost the check for December. So I started spending against that money.
THERAPIST: I see. (0:32:00)
CLIENT: And somehow I spent it all, $1,400. You know, insurance premiums, you know, both auto and life.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, $200 to the farm for, to reserve our CSA which Jess doesn't want to do and doesn't know that we're doing, you know. But I'm just like, I feel like I've got to start eating more vegetables then that, you know, I've got to start getting involved with, you know, going to the farm and picking it up and, you know. I mean our lives are not that busy that we can't sit down and use the food, you know. We've got to use this food because it's a lot of food for the amount of money we pay, healthy food.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know, and.
THERAPIST: So it (inaudible at 00:32:54) that makes sense if you can just, like stay focused enough.
CLIENT: Yeah, because it can be overwhelming, you get a ton of food Saturday morning and then Saturday and so stuff sits out it gets bad, you know, use it all, you know. And I've got at some point, you know, so I kind of want somebody's events to get behind us so I can say to Jess, oh yeah I signed us up for the farm again, you know. If she doesn't want to do it then I'll do it all by myself and I'll have to figure out how to, you know, make food for myself which would save me a ton of money, you know. (Pause at [00:33:37] - 00:33:40). I eat out way to much and I eat poorly, you know. Even going to like Trader Joe's, you know, but still a lot of it's prepackaged, pre-prepared food.
THERAPIST: Yep. (Pause at [00:34:01] - 00:34:05).
CLIENT: I mean I try and like going to buy salad and stuff like that and you know, but I don't go shopping every week so it's only like a week that I have the good lettuce and then it's gone where if I was going to the farm I would have some steadiness of vegetables coming in and I would get a supplement, you know, or ... we've been doing this for eight, nine years I mean (inaudible at 00:34:32) yet but just kind of feel committed to it. I can't let go of it, you know, it's like the football tickets, you know. It's like if we give it up it's going to be gone and I don't want it to be gone.
THERAPIST: For Buddy I think.
CLIENT: Yeah. Ah, no I could slit his throat. (Pause at [00:34:58] - 00:35:01). That would be the quickest, painless. (Pause at [00:35:07] - 00:35:15). My phone is not ringing at all, I mean I walk in my office there's no voice mail there's nothing going on which keeps my costs down but my costs are up when I'm busy.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Copies and faxes and telephone calls, you know, all the service charges I would get in my office but low, I mean way low. And (pause at [00:35:49] - 00:35:52). So much is done by, through e-mail now but still (pause at [00:35:59] - 00:36:34). I don't know if I should start playing scratch tickets.
THERAPIST: Well, what do you think? (Laughing) (Pause at [00:36:46] - 00:36:53).
CLIENT: I've got to do something. It's really, you know, just (pause at [00:37:03] - 00:37:58).
THERAPIST: Is there anything else you're thinking you can do?
CLIENT: I don't know I mean, the problem is, you know, I could do other things, I've tried. I've tried this estate claiming and it's just not, you know, it's not working, it's not, you know, like a website that, you know, the guys. It's like I've got to reach out to him, he should be okay Evan let's get your website going and let's get your wife on there, you know, he hasn't done it. I think about it at times like this and don't think about at times when I'm in front of the computer able to send them an e-mail, you know. (Pause at [00:38:43] - 00:38:45). But, you know, that's basically good money thrown away that Jess didn't want to spend. (Pause at [00:38:53] - 00:39:15). Pissed her off because I did it anyways, you know, even though she didn't want to do it. But I don't know what else to do as far as, you know, like be going to more Chamber events or like we don't go to any Chamber events but there is stuff I could be doing. But my motivation is just zero, it's probably negative, you know. He and I is, it becomes depressing, you know, just (pause at [00:39:53] - 00:39:56). I don't want to say the people who are left don't care but, you know, (pause at [00:40:04] - 00:40:15).
THERAPIST: But it's really big hits.
CLIENT: You know, it's like ... there's a woman who visited, a membership committee, I should follow-up with the woman as well but I never did, and they never did and, you know, we're just not doing the things you have to do, you know and (pause at [00:40:38] - 00:40:41). You can't do it all and, you know. (Pause at [00:40:46] - 00:40:55). You know, people kind of know that like they don't have to come to the meeting because we're not going to kick anyone out, you know, there's no (pause at [00:41:05] - 00:42:12).
THERAPIST: All righty. Take care.
