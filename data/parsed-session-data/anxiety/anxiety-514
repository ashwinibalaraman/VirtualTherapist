BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	You want a glass or?
<b>PT:</b>	No, that's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Out of the can, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Never know where cans are, so I'll put [INAUDIBLE] for you.  How's your work?
<b>PT:</b>	It's going good.  Wearing me, I mean, it's good right now [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You're still enjoying it?
<b>PT:</b>	I am right now, yeah.  Well, [INAUDIBLE] project.
<b>DR:</b>	What's your project?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, this company that [INAUDIBLE] and, um, this company I cold called, well, we're finally getting [INAUDIBLE] total outsource and the start date's October first, so we've got just tons of information to gather, you know, to upload into our system because they're wanting to transmit [INAUDIBLE] electronically [INAUDIBLE] or, you know, lots of vendors call and get all their, it's a lot of work.
<b>DR:</b>	And this is on you?
<b>PT:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE].  I feel like it's all on me, um, because, you know, I am among people who are trying to work with, you know, um, [INAUDIBLE], so it's kind of like can we have discussions about what's got to be done, and they're like, okay, fine, here do this, you know.  [INAUDIBLE] people too, but—
<b>DR:</b>	They know they can count on you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true.  But [INAUDIBLE], um, it was kind of funny, we had a conference call today with some people over at corporate, and, um, my boss [INAUDIBLE] so for like 15 minutes he was like I guess [INAUDIBLE], you know.  [INAUDIBLE] hour and a half, and, um, you know, and then I go, kind of go in there and talk to him a little bit about the recap and then I tell him about it, and he's like no, no, no, we're not going to do that, we're not going to da, da, da.
<b>DR:</b>	And do everything.
<b>PT:</b>	Like thanks lot, okay, you know, this wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't stepped out of the meeting.  But, um, and, so I think he could tell I was like a little overwhelmed or whatever, and he was just like, okay, don't freak out, it's okay, he's like [INAUDIBLE].  But don't worry about a thing, this is all going to work out and then that's when he was like, okay, why don't we have a meeting at the end of the day thing, kind of regroup, and, you know, [INAUDIBLE].  And I don't mind because [INAUDIBLE] I just want to know what they, you know, I need, [INAUDIBLE] doing it for a while.  [INAUDIBLE] clear, you know, [NAME OTHER], I need you to [INAUDIBLE] or—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll do it and I'll do it right, but I need you to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You're going to write it down too.  You take a lot of notes in your meetings, I assume?
<b>PT:</b>	In these meetings, yes, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE], but and these were everything's new to me [INAUDIBLE].  But I've been, um, I called the other day, I don't know if it's just slow and that's the reason why I feel like I'm, I'm not daydreaming anymore, but like I'm just I don't want to do it.  You know, it's stuff I need to do at the time, but I'm having trouble, um, you know, I'm supposed to [INAUDIBLE] calls and I forget about what I'm supposed to be working on and I get distracted, you know, I want to pull up something on the internet or I start kind of fiddling with this or things like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I forget, [INAUDIBLE] you know, you've got to do this, you've got to do this, you've got to do this, you've got to do that.  So, um, I was thinking, I was like, well, maybe that would help [INAUDIBLE] my job right now, you know, because I want to, I've been doing well and for a while there I had no other, you know, I had no choice.  But, you know, I mean, I had to be on the [INAUDIBLE].  There was no getting around it.  But right now things are slower.  So it's easier for me to get off track.  And it's not keeping my numbers up the way I want to.  So because I want to keep [INAUDIBLE] high level because I'm finally at that point now.
<b>DR:</b>	So we need to be efficient?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  I want to be as efficient as possible.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, how about your depression, how are we doing there?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it's okay.  I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's just living alone, I've been living alone a while now and I'm wondering like if I'm, I have no [INAUDIBLE] eating some, it's really the anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] anxiety, um, I was doing [INAUDIBLE] for a little while.  Like [INAUDIBLE] 3 days a week.  Um, then I just kind of out of going.
<b>DR:</b>	Easy to do.
<b>PT:</b>	What?
<b>DR:</b>	Easy to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Takes a lot of willpower.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and like I had a friend, and that's the thing too, is like I had a friend who I sat next to every day who I was going with.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	For like 2 months there.  And then she left.  And so now it's like it's, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	You have somebody who can kind of encourage you and you encourage them, it's so much better, isn't it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and now I have this other [INAUDIBLE], you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Sounded like more fun?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] more fun than, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I know it's silly but it was a little bit closer [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Not like on the way home from work?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's, I live over next to the VA hospital and it's over on [DEIDENTIFIED], you know where, you know where that big complex is if you're going down [DEIDENTIFIED], and there's that large complex to the left, like you're heading towards [DEIDENTIFIED].  And [INAUDIBLE] exit.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	There's all those soccer fields.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Right down there.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's about 20 minutes.
<b>DR:</b>	That's about, uh, yeah.  It's a long ways.  You need a passport when you go out that area.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] like 20 miles, gas, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	They do have places out near the VA as I recall.
<b>PT:</b>	They do.  I don't know my area.
<b>DR:</b>	I would think so.
<b>PT:</b>	There's a place, there's some karate place down the street, you know, do cardio kickboxing [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, even the, what is it, the [DEIDENTIFIED] would be closer, on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] expensive, it was, um, I don't know, yeah, it's something to look into.
<b>DR:</b>	Where's your work?
<b>PT:</b>	I work over [DEIDENTIFIED].  I was thinking, you know, I could, I told them, I was like, I need to leave like 10 minutes early, [INAUDIBLE] four fifty eight [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	But anyway, that's something to look into.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I'm looking [INAUDIBLE] kickball.
<b>DR:</b>	Kickball?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You have to tell me about this.
<b>PT:</b>	It's an adult league in town.
<b>DR:</b>	Kickball.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I'd love to go watch that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] all drunk or something or?
<b>PT:</b>	After somebody got into a fight last year you're not allowed to drink during the games anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So, but it used to be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I was going to say that sounds like dodgeball or something, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  But, um, some [INAUDIBLE] after the games, but, yeah, I joined a kickball league, which I thought would be a great way to meet people, you know.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, people are outgoing enough to go out and play [INAUDIBLE] kickball, then, you know, [INAUDIBLE] so there's like 24 teams.
<b>DR:</b>	I bet you haven't played that in a while.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's kind of cool.
<b>DR:</b>	Where do they play?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [DEIDENTIFIED] and [INAUDIBLE] there's a park down there on [DEIDENTIFIED], um, [INAUDIBLE].  A park down there and they play all over the place.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's funny.  Well, good I'm glad you're at least you're looking and thinking.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So are you getting out with some friends besides in the bars?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You do other things.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't, I really, I don't hit the bars.  I mean, I don't go, I really don't go out, I mean, unless I'm with friends from home.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and it's like a special thing and we're just going out, but I don't like to just, you know, 2 girls just go out for the night.  Like that's not really.
<b>DR:</b>	Not you?
<b>PT:</b>	That's not me.  I mean, I'll go out after work for happy hour, you know, [INAUDIBLE] drinks, and then I'll sit home.  But, you know, I'd rather go to a friend's house on a weekend night and watch football or.
<b>DR:</b>	Is that kind of what you do?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Go home often?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.  No, [INAUDIBLE] just wait and keep, try to go home [INAUDIBLE], saving for the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So your job's okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's okay, stressful right now, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Able to pay your bills, save a little money?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're getting ahead of it?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, not really.  I've got savings, because the way my job works is, um, you know, [INAUDIBLE] you get a big bonus for whatever the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I just put it in savings and I pull from it when I need it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, good.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] medications but—
<b>DR:</b>	You're not blowing it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and I probably really need to [INAUDIBLE] if I could.
<b>DR:</b>	But you don't [INAUDIBLE]?  Bonuses?  I don't know.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, my bonuses?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I do get a bonus, I do get a, they have quarterly bonuses as well and I could get one, and I usually get [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's not really too extravagant is it?
<b>PT:</b>	No, well, it depends on [INAUDIBLE].  Hundred bucks get your [INAUDIBLE] going.  Yeah, but I do it 3 times a year.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I do it 3 times a year.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	What's that?
<b>DR:</b>	He just doesn't realize that it costs so much.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  He doesn't even know you're supposed to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So you've [INAUDIBLE] a little bit.  You're keeping up with your bills, that's not a stress point for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no, I mean, I'm not missing bills, I mean, I'm paying everything and—
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good thing.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, I don't wait until they're due, I mean, I pay them as soon as they come in.  And then I still [INAUDIBLE], so.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you still taking the Effexor?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Don't miss it often?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  God, if I do, I mean, I—
<b>DR:</b>	Feel bad?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] why am I getting, like why am I tired, why is my stomach bothering or why am I feeling kind of lightheaded or why do I feel like crying, like, oh yeah, [INAUDIBLE] you forgot to take your Effexor yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	You still on the Glucophage?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You seeing your internist once in a while that's prescribing that?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, I just, I need, that's why I'm [INAUDIBLE].  My cousin, [NAME OTHER], she [INAUDIBLE] out of town and I called to see about getting set up with an appointment [INAUDIBLE], and nobody called me back.
<b>DR:</b>	Who's that?
<b>PT:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	I know a [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	A young guy?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And he works over on [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b>	I think they have 3 offices.  Internists.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's the guy.  She really, really liked him a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	I work with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who's the name of the group in, anyway, 5 or 6 of the guys, no, they're all very competent.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she said she liked him a lot and, um, and I was just thinking, you know, I mean, I like my gynecologist a lot.  Like she's wonderful.  She's really nice and she's one of the first doctors.
<b>DR:</b>	You need that person.
<b>PT:</b>	What?
<b>DR:</b>	You need that person.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean, she's one of the first doctors I've had, you know, as far as a gynecologist who actually, I mean, she took time and really talked to me and she listened.  You know, it wasn't like, okay, let's speed this up, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And apologized for holding me up in the waiting room.  I mean, usually [INAUDIBLE] you have to sit in the waiting room for an hour and a half, but you know, she, I was waiting for 30 minutes and then she apologized for being late.
<b>DR:</b>	Who's this?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, what's her name?  Oh, I hate that [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] or downtown here?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's downtown at, um, right in where [DEIDENTIFIED] used to be.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	She's with [DEIDENTIFIED].  She's an older woman.  She's just really nice and—
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	I was like okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Is that who put you on the Glucophage?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I've been on that, that was [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been through like 4, just jumping around, mostly because my mom always tells me I don't like this person.  So I'm like okay, I'll switch.  So like they're not asking, they're not doing the right, enough tests, they're not, you know, checking this or that, da, da, da.  I'm like, okay.  But finally I found this woman, I'm like, well, I really like her, she's really nice, you know.  And mom's like, well, did she do this, did she do this, I'm like no, well, [INAUDIBLE].  But then I figured if I just get an internist or something like that, you know, hopefully they'll run all those tests anyway.
<b>DR:</b>	What tests are we talking about that she wants done?
<b>PT:</b>	She wants me to be testing, um, my blood sugar, you know, and hormone levels and all that stuff to make sure I'm still on track.  I mean, she's just always, she and I are able to talk about that stuff a lot easier now.  I don't know if it's just because I'm older and I'm just more interested now or—
<b>DR:</b>	It's kind of nature.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess so.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what it is, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	And she's even brought up, you know, she's talked about, um, [INAUDIBLE] she's talked about [INAUDIBLE] that's because she hates, I mean, I agree with her too, like I feel like my weight's holding me up, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Holding me back.  You know, I have tried [INAUDIBLE] with the band, you know, like she's talking about stomach banding or this and that and the other, and I'm like [INAUDIBLE], you know, I'm like [INAUDIBLE] one day and it's a little more expensive than I thought it was.
<b>DR:</b>	It's more expensive?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Pretty expensive.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But I found out my insurance covers like 80% of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You been out to talk to them?
<b>PT:</b>	What?
<b>DR:</b>	Have you had a consult out there and talked to them?
<b>PT:</b>	No, well, [INAUDIBLE] video conference or something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And then you have to meet, you know, with, you know, a therapist or [INAUDIBLE] or something like that and get approval there, and there's all these different steps and, um, yeah, so I got [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I can do that for you if you want.  Give you a [INAUDIBLE] letter.  I've done it before for people.  Give you a letter that says you're not crazy.
<b>PT:</b>	I gotcha.  Okay.  Yeah, so I mean, but still it's a lot like, I'm like wow, it's a big commitment, you know.  It's, you know, um—
<b>DR:</b>	It does work.
<b>PT:</b>	What?
<b>DR:</b>	It does seem to work though.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But you have to remember that you still have to do the diet.  It's not like you can, you know, eat tons of food and—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  No, I can imagine.  Um, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It's outpatient, it's pretty quick.  You should go talk to them, at least go do the video.  They're not going to like grab you and haul you off to the ER, or the OR rather.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I know [INAUDIBLE] something to think about, so.  But I'm right at kind of the limit for where, you know, they even consider doing it as far as, you know, BMI and whatnot.
<b>DR:</b>	What, you supposed to gain some more weight, then they will?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm going to follow it up [INAUDIBLE] to do that, you know.  I think they, um—
<b>DR:</b>	It's been a struggle.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] stuff, you know, also [INAUDIBLE] pre—diabetes or whatever [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Keep thinking about it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] thought about it a lot, you know, I thought about maybe I could joint Weight Watchers again and get [INAUDIBLE] to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Weight Watchers is tough, again, without doing it with somebody.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'm not, [INAUDIBLE] like I actually, um, I think I lost like 10 pounds or something, I mean, I really did, I lost 10 pounds on it, you know, and like I haven't ever lost like any weight before.  Like when I actually did do it, but then I got off track and I quit going and, you know, and it was easy just to make excuses here [INAUDIBLE] when I did kind of stick with it for a week or for 2 weeks [INAUDIBLE] lost 10 pounds, like I really [INAUDIBLE] 10 pounds.  Yeah, so.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good feeling.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but then I guess there was [INAUDIBLE].  Well, I want to go up there, and you won't believe it, like they come in there and [INAUDIBLE] 9 pounds, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	There you go again.
<b>PT:</b>	What?
<b>DR:</b>	Always comparing yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	And I always think, you know, I don't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	The people that lose the weight slow and deliberately over a long period of time keep it off.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I know that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	This woman that drops 9 pounds in a week or 9 pounds every week for a couple of weeks most likely is not going to keep it off.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I just, honestly, I mean, I diet or whatnot, honestly I just forget.  I really just forget that I'm on a diet, you know.  [INAUDIBLE] and then all of a sudden I'm going to back and I'm eating them.  I'm just like wait a minute.  I'm wondering does anybody else do that?  But, um, because it's not, only if I really thought about it, you know, or how to, you know, remember not to [INAUDIBLE] eat, then, yeah, but usually it's just, you know, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You seeing anybody lately?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Is that okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, it's something I'm definitely [INAUDIBLE] do more than I have in a really long time, but, you know, I'm not seeing anybody and there's a guy at work I'm interested in, but he's more of a friend, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Nobody from your past contacting you and recently?
<b>PT:</b>	What's that?
<b>DR:</b>	No guys from your past contacting you recently?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, no, I mean, the army guys really, but—
<b>DR:</b>	I mean people that you wouldn't want to contact you?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, no.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	That's fine.  I mean, you know, [INAUDIBLE] so much, so.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] you know about the medicines for your attentional problems, you want to go back on the same?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, it's been a long time.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It's been a while, and so I mean my reasons for not taking it is because I didn't want [INAUDIBLE] to make me feel [INAUDIBLE].  But I'm not, but then again when I was taking it though like in school, I was taking it like just randomly.  It was when I had to buckle down [INAUDIBLE].  So I don't know, and I was [INAUDIBLE] stay up late night which would make me feel bad anyway, and [INAUDIBLE] bad feelings associated with it.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe.
<b>PT:</b>	Have to do with that.  I mean, you know, when you're having to pull 2 all nighters in a row with some cat naps in between, I mean, that's just, that's miserable.  That's what I love about having a job is that I'm not [INAUDIBLE] do that anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, for, really all you ever took was Adderall.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	There's about 7 other drugs we could try.  Find something that might work better for you.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] Adderall.
<b>DR:</b>	Try the other class and see if it's of any, if it's better for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I wouldn't want, I mean, think of these, because I want to, you know, maybe it could just help me just getting home, you know, just make me want to, something to give me a little more [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know if that's necessarily what's it for, but, but, you know, [INAUDIBLE] kick in the butt, [INAUDIBLE] maybe you want to go out or do this or that or, you know, [INAUDIBLE] be more productive.  [INAUDIBLE] I'm just tired.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe it's something that lasts maybe a few hours, you can just take it as needed.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And if you don't like that, then we could switch it to something longer acting.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, could you do a referral, do I need a referral to go see an internist, or?
<b>DR:</b>	You can just give them my name if you do.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Give my name.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] if he's the one down on, they have 3 offices, they've got one out by [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know what you mean by off [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	That's just [INAUDIBLE].  [INAUDIBLE] she couldn't see him, she'd get shuffled off to a nurse practitioner, so.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know if that's the same [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or not.  It'd be good to have an internist either way.
<b>PT:</b>	You have someone else?
<b>DR:</b>	No, I don't know.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, I mean, I don't know this, I don't know if that's the same one, but [INAUDIBLE] just find somebody you're comfortable with.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I would like someone more that kind of specialized in, you know, like my situation.  You know what I mean?  Like with the pre—diabetes and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Does he?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't know where to start looking for something like that.  And I thought about [INAUDIBLE] I just did some research on the internet and I was like, you know, I found this doctor at [DEIDENTIFIED] who [INAUDIBLE] you know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Mostly those people are going to be gynecologists.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And so, um, I think she was.  [INAUDIBLE] and see if there's something that I could be doing that I'm not doing.  I mean, I know what I should be doing.  I know I should, you know, lose weight, a lot of that stuff's going to clear, you know, clear up on its own.  But—
<b>DR:</b>	You have a lot of symptoms from it?  You have pain?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  No, I've never actually had any issues with that.  Like, um, you know, irregular periods, well, I've been on like birth control for as long as, I mean, like ninth grade, and I guess [INAUDIBLE] stuff like that.  Um, but, yeah, other than that it's not an issue.  I remember my like dermatologist when I was like in the 6th or 7th grade, like he noticed something about [INAUDIBLE].  I had a really strong jaw for my age, or something like that.  So he, mom and I went to this endocrinologist and he's gone now but they did some blood tests and then [INAUDIBLE] my, like my hormones weren't fusing together properly.  It's not that I had extras of one or the other, but they weren't fusing properly.  So that was kind of a hint.  But this doc's probably never picked up on the poly ovarian [INAUDIBLE].  It's too early.  I didn't find out about that until I was in college.  So but thankfully because my dermatologist pushed it so hard, like it was [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] or whatever, he, um, they got me on birth control, kept me on it all through [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sound like you want to make some changes in your life.
<b>PT:</b>	I want to, I just, I do.  I'd really like to, but I just [INAUDIBLE] tired.  And, um, [INAUDIBLE] from work but it's time to make changes, you know, it's like [INAUDIBLE] energy.
<b>DR:</b>	You might have to get to where you don't go home.  You know, you go from work to the gym or something, or to Weight Watchers.  Because once you go home it's, you know, like you said, it's—
<b>PT:</b>	And my dog's there.  I guess it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I've got to go home and let him out, you know.  He's a sweet little dog, I mean, he's crying [INAUDIBLE] there for 11 hours not getting to go out.  But if I needed to make some changes and it meant sitting at home for a little bit, you know, my parents would agree to that.  But I just got rid of my brother's dog, but that's a big difference from my dog and my brother's dog.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, too big.
<b>PT:</b>	He had a Weimaraner, she's crazy.  I mean, she's wonderful and, but I've never met a dog like that before.  She's a pain.  But she's beautiful and she's sweet.  I mean, she'd, she's so tall but she would curl up in a little ball right here and then just put her head on you and [INAUDIBLE] I've ever seen.
<b>DR:</b>	What are you doing tonight, speaking of doing something different?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm just going to go over and see a friend of mine [INAUDIBLE] but I don't really have any plans for tonight.  I might call my brother or, actually I was going to cook.  I have all this food at the house and I was planning on cooking.
<b>DR:</b>	For just yourself?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good that you're doing cooking.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I try to.  I'm trying to do better about that.
<b>DR:</b>	Instead of eating out.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  A lot of times though, I mean, there've been times when I just go home and I just, [INAUDIBLE] and I'm too cheap to order, you know, delivery.  Because I hate paying [INAUDIBLE] that delivery charge, it's just stupid, so I'm just like, oh, I'll just [INAUDIBLE] cook something.
<b>DR:</b>	Let me get you some dextrostat.  It's one of the, um, ingredients of Adderall but it's only going to last maybe 4 hours, 5 hours.  Try it in the morning, try it after lunch, kind of thing.  You can take a third dose 4:00, 3:00.  See how long that lasts first, how many hours and see what dose works.  Let's try probably a whole tablet first.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Take 1 to 2 tablets.  And 4:00 PM kind of thing.  Take it too late and they keep you up.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you can cut them in half so you can take one and a half.  And just let me know in a week or so how it's working.  Leave me a message and [INAUDIBLE] give me an idea.  I think that's the times when you were taking the Adderall it seemed like it was making [INAUDIBLE] too strong, started making you feel kind of out of it.
<b>PT:</b>	I was, um, clenching my jaw.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but with this we'll try something a little bit another way.  There's a lot of things we can try [INAUDIBLE] should help.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] or.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think so.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's not a tic, but it's kind of like—
<b>PT:</b>	I wonder [INAUDIBLE] that's what my brother [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] whole bunch of coffee [INAUDIBLE] you know, you can clench your teeth and you just get kind of on edge.  That's what this can do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just remember my jaw being sore.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what, we don't want that.  If you decide to do the band and you need a letter, you know, clearance from mental health, let me know and I'll type one up for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you've got insurance that'll pay for it 80%, that's pretty cool.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's [INAUDIBLE], you know, and they cover, you know, for any approved physician [INAUDIBLE], and so—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] like in the program out at [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	They seem to do pretty good.  I've known a number of people who went to them.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's pretty simple, it's just a laparoscopy and [INAUDIBLE].  There's a lot of research now about why people are overweight.  You know, there's a lot of prejudice, you know, I guess people that are overweight, but, you know, the [INAUDIBLE] just weak, you know, willpower, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not true.
<b>PT:</b>	No.  [INAUDIBLE] fast too.  I mean, I feel like [INAUDIBLE] but I think it was honestly I went [INAUDIBLE] the same.  It didn't really work.  And, you know, it was just [INAUDIBLE] so I know about [INAUDIBLE] earlier or, you know, [INAUDIBLE], you know, I mean, there's all this way of put it, but I mean, I just [INAUDIBLE] and stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	It's got to have something to do with glucose metabolism, endocrine systems do.  And genetics I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and genetics too.  I mean, so.
<b>DR:</b>	But there's a lot of prejudice.  I remember reading something by, what's that singer, Meatloaf, remember him?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	He was talking about how he got more grief from people for being overweight than he did when he was a drug addict.  People are more accepting of him being a drug addict than him being overweight.
<b>PT:</b>	Honestly, I've never had, I mean, when I was a little bit younger, like junior high, but being older, I've never had any problems.  I don't know if it's just because I'm tall and then also, I mean, I do feel like I have quite a bit of good muscle tone as heavy as I am, so I carry it better than a lot of people do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, but I've never had, you know, people never, when I was like in high school, people didn't make comments, you know, when I was in college nobody did.  I mean, you know, I think my brother one time something stuck out it was like I went to go see him when he was at military school and his friend said something.  And he got [INAUDIBLE] and I was like, you know, you tell the man [INAUDIBLE] something ugly, but, um, but I really didn't care.  [INAUDIBLE] kind of go like you know I'm big, you know, whatever, I mean, tell me something I don't know.  It's just never bothered me and nobody's ever, I don't bring it up either.  It's not something I discuss.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, anybody else bringing it up doesn't help, just makes it worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let me know how the dextrostat works.  Like I say, they're tablets, you can cut them.  Take care of you.  I'm glad you're okay.  I'm glad your mood's good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, pretty good.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Doing this weekend?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Watch the game tonight?
<b>PT:</b>	Um [INAUDIBLE] maybe.
<b>DR:</b>	Got a friend you can watch it with, that kind of thing?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE].
