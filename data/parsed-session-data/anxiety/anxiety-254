<font size="4"><b>I: Parenting: An Introduction</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


This chapter introduces the concept of parenting in its widest sense. It addresses briefly
the emergence of parenting into public and academic awareness and gives an overview
of its essential elements, areas of application and prerequisites. Certain critical areas
that warrant further exploration and development are briefly outlined.


<b>EVOLUTION</b>


Procreation is the core, irreducible process on
which the survival of the species depends. Survival
is commonly accepted as the main, overarching
goal of much behaviour. However, procreation is
no use if offspring do not survive. To ensure survival
is the chief task of parenting (Potts and Short,
1999). The human infant is a particularly vulnerable
creature, unable to look after itself until well
into its middle childhood. In complex modern
societies, the need for parental protection and supported
living is stretching beyond middle child~hood,
whereas searching for food and primary
survival might be possible by middle childhood in
simpler societies. There is, as ever, a strong
case for considering both nature and nurture to be
interdependently implicated in the growth of
infants into effective citizens. Parenting is the
critical medium for this (Collins et al., 2000).


Historically and across the globe, parents
have had to cope with limited resources for sustenance;
external threats to survival; poor child
life expectancy; arbitrary exercise of power by
rulers which threatened parents or their
children; use of children as cheap labour; and
wars, which reduced economic resources and
frequently disrupted or permanently broke families.
For many, these threats have become less
intrusive, but there are still large stretches of the
world where they are present. Even in developed
countries, many parents still have to contend
with pressures that affect and potentially undermine
their effectiveness (Hoghughi, 1999).

• greater tendency of mothers to do paid work
outside the home and having to contend with
the physical and emotional consequences of
work


• increasing unacceptability of traditional means
of corrective discipline and uncertainties
about appropriate boundaries for children's
behaviour


• increase in influence of peers and their
culture, relative to that of parents


• greater awareness and empowerment of
young people, legally and informally


• growth of urban environments and exposure
of children to strong external influences,
including advertising and the media


• increasing emergence of societies, particularly
in the West, in which there are no longer
any standard or central models of parenting


In the West, there has been a historically
U-shaped relationship between wealth and number
of children. The richest and the poorest always
had the largest number of children and those with
middle incomes the fewest. But the long-term
general trend has been a gradual convergence in
family sizes, not least because of the reduction in
child deaths. Now, in the West, due to the
changes in balance of power between men and
women and economic influences on adults, fewer
get married or choose to have children, with long-term
economic and social consequences (Taylor
and Taylor, 2001). Children have always been a
significant economic drain on parents. Even in
those societies where parents receive financial aid
for child-rearing, this is often not regarded as adequate.
Many adults who just 'managed' before,
slip into poverty with the appearance of the first
child and descend further with each new child
(HM Treasury, 1999). Thus, at least in the material
sense, having children detracts from the 'good
life' to which many aspire.


The significant rise in the status of mothers as
women, their increasing role as paid workers and
breadwinners, and their ability to pursue careers in
their own right, all press towards reduced involvement
in parenting (Maitland, 2001). Nor does not
having children carry any social stigma. However,
despite these pressures and awareness of the costs
of bringing up children in physical, economic,
emotional and other terms, the biological imperative
of perpetuating the species through having
and raising children has largely, though variably,
prevailed. It has been suggested that many men
and women do not acquire their 'proper' gender
role until they have a child (Arendel, 1997).
Despite significant changes, particularly in
Western societies, the motivation to have children
remains strong, as shown by the development and
spread of fertility assistance services. This is
because raising children serves many purposes -
the 'goal state' to which adults aspire. These
include:
<table>

children and thus (implicitly) perpetuating
the species;

and skills; and

having and bringing up children.


Most parents would be baffled if asked why
they had or wanted children, and unlikely to give
clear reasons. Having children is 'natural', a
flowering of the relationship with a (loved) partner;
fulfilment of a social expectation and definition
of their own full male- or femalehood and
the often inarticulate but telling 'just want them'.
For most adults parenting serves different goals
and expectations. There are also the 'accidental'
parents - men and women who are sexual
partners or who casually mate and produce
unplanned children.


Deliberately delayed childbirth, particularly
among the middle classes, suggests that children
and their demands are being weighed against
other personal and social goals with which they
may interfere. Unless the current, almost global,
push towards employment for both parents is
only a passing phenomenon, it is likely that producing
children will become an ever more calculated
and less spontaneous act. Social evolution
and psychological fulfilment may well diminish
or negate the 'biological' impulse, started with
separation of sex from pregnancy but propelled
now by a wider array of influences. This is but
one aspect of the increasing diversity of families
and contexts for parenting and the often positive
impact on their children (Lamb, 1999).

<i><b>Parenting in Public Awareness</b></i>


At one level, thinking about children must have
been among the earliest cognitions of human
beings regarding their own activities. Where
written records are available, there are references
to parenting and parental activities from the
earliest times (French, 1995). As societies developed
and their structures formalized, parenting
became increasingly formulated in religious,
economic, civic and cultural contexts. Given
their vulnerability, children have probably
always been regarded as special, and childhood
as a distinct phase of life. Given the brutality of
much life and the struggle for survival at all
levels, it is likely that in the past children
received the same amount of attention, relative to
their 'times', as they do today (Heywood, 2001).
From the 18th century onwards, they began to be
seen as distinct persons rather than as mini adults
or labouring hands, though industrialization
extended the use of children as cheap labour.


Historically continuous male labour mobility
was dramatically increased by consecutive
industrial revolutions from the 18th century
onwards. This factor, as well as good evolutionary
reasons, always demanded that women were
children's primary care-givers. From the mid-19th
century onwards, public recognition grew
that for some children this care was deficient
and the state must intervene to protect them.
Although the teachers' role as being in <i>loco
parentis</i> had long been recognized, it was only in
the 20th century that in most Western countries,
the state began to adopt a parallel parenting support
or substitute care role to that of biological
parents. All but the least developed countries
now have provisions for public care and protection
of children. The death of nearly 80 children
a year in the UK for example, at the hands of
parents or other carers, suggests this intervention is
only partially effective. For the parents, reconciling
their own welfare with those of their children
must have always been a complex and demanding
task but its difficulties have massively increased, at
least for those in the West. The economic and
social context is now more complex and opaque
than before, and meeting the needs of children has
gained a higher legal and social priority.


Recognition of widespread child abuse and
deficiencies in biological parents in the latter half
of the 20th century gave particular thrust to the
codification of specific child jurisprudence
(Houlgate, 1980; Freeman, 1983), coinciding
with the later spread of Nozick's (1977) powerful
political philosophy that 'individuals own themselves'.
The subtle and indirect impact of this has
bred the concept that parents have their children
'in trust' (Alston et al., 1992). This means that
they do not 'own' their children and cannot do
with them what they want. Most national laws,
certainly in the West, recognize that children
should receive at least a culturally assigned minimum
level of care and positive developmental
opportunities and freedom from abuse. This is
now enshrined in the United Nations Charter of
Children's Rights. Parents are regarded as the
main agents of delivery of these rights, with the
state in a 'policing' and supportive back-up role.
Some countries, such as New Zealand, Norway
and Wales, have Children's Commissioners or
Ombudsmen, to oversee the general care and protection
of children and compatibility of legal and
social structures with their best interests.


The <i>relative</i> compactness and smaller population
of these countries suggests that children's
issues, of which parenting and its support are
major elements, are of a different order of complexity
in other, equally developed countries.
There is little doubt, however, that there is a
gradual cultural shift in most developed countries
towards recognizing qualities of parenting as the
major shaper of children's state and prospects
(Hoghughi and Speight, 1998).


Freud's emphasis on the central role of early
specialization of children on their later adjustment
was the most influential early pointer to the
importance of parenting. The evidence produced
was largely based on clinical cases. Quantitative
research in parenting and its impact on children
dates mainly from around the second quarter of
the 20th century. Although childhood abnormalities
and poor family histories had been considered
in the context of poverty, ill health and delinquency,
it was the emergence of empirical child
psychiatry and psychology that gave a focus to
much parenting research. These ideas and the general
spirit of the times led to the work of Erikson
(1950, 1964), who formulated, almost from first
principles and based on acute observation of
people and knowledge of cultural history, a framework
for looking at lifespan development. His
ideas have been profoundly influential among professionals
and academics concerned with children,
though less central to the understanding of influences
on parenting.


The Second World War massively disrupted
family life. Only by this time, there were professionals
and academics who could research and
report on the adverse consequences of family
disruption on children. One such was Bowlby
(1951), who instigated studies on the effects of
removing children from their city-dwelling
parents to the safety of the country in wartime
Britain. Bowlby conceptualized the many disturbances
of children's lives as centring on the

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Major Conceptual Contributions</b></i>


Any list of major contributions to our view of parenting
is likely to be selective and invidious, in an
enterprise to which many have contributed.
However, most would identify some key theoretical
contributions which are now an indispensable aid to
understanding parenting processes. These cannot
always be neatly compartmentalized and have produced
much cross-fertilization and enquiry.


Historically, pride of place must go to John
Bowlby (1951, 1980) and his formulation of the
concepts of maternal deprivation and <i>attachment</i>,
subsequently modified and much elaborated by
others. It is now evident that early maternal deprivation
by itself does not have the disastrous consequences
Bowlby suggested (Clarke and Clarke,
1976). Rather, damage is done by circumstances
associated with maternal deprivation, such as distress,
and inconsistency of care. Effects of separation
from biological parents can be moderated by
the child's age and the quality of substitute care, but
some disruptions of attachment appear to have
adverse long-term consequences. Winnicott (1958),
of the same broad psychotherapeutic mould as
Bowlby, introduced the humane and necessary concept
of <i>good enough parenting</i> as a desirable goal
of what parents do. This suggests that 'perfect' parenting,
even if it could be articulated, is both
improbable and unnecessary for satisfactory development
of children. Realistically, the most and the
best parents can do for their children is to give them
a core of unconditional love and reliable care, providing
a safe setting for children's own resilience
and developmental potential to unfold - as demonstrated
by the larger part of humanity.


Ainsworth and her colleagues, over a period of
time, extended Bowlby's concept of attachment
and established it in both professional and
informed public consciousness, as a significant
outcome of good parenting processes (Ainsworth
et al., 1998). Although there are theoretical and
empirical problems with the concept of
attachment, there is general agreement that
<i>secure attachment</i> is a crucial outcome of good
parenting, creating a lifelong protective shield
for the developing child against adversity
(Cassidy and Shaver, 1999). Much of the material
in the present book endorses this view.


Bronfenbrenner showed that parenting practices
reflect and interact with the 'social and ecological
context' of children and parents (Bronfenbrenner,
1979; Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). The child
may be the focus of parents' concerns and activities,
but the effectiveness of these activities is dramatically
dependent on parents' own relationships, economic
circumstances, cultural context, and the
wider social and political structures within which
they operate. The increasing experience of parents
over time, as well as their developmental perspectives
also affect the way they bring up their children.
The interdependent operation of a wide array of
factors needs to be understood as a preliminary to
making sense of parenting practices. The sophistication
of many newer parenting support programmes,
such as Sure Start in the UK (see chapter 2), can be
traced back to Bronfenbrenner's work.


Parents' responses to the prevailing cultural
climate, and their own personal styles lead to
very different approaches to managing their
children. As children grow older and their behaviour
diversifies and becomes more complex, so
they need and respond to different management
approaches. Baumrind (1968, 1989) has investigated
the critical issues of child management in
its social and developmental context, through
wide-ranging research and highly influential
explorations of the topic. Most parents are seen
to use a variety of styles, depending on their perception
of the child's needs and age and gravity
of circumstances, with few 'pure' management
styles. Broadly speaking, <i>authoritative parenting</i>,
which clarifies and enforces boundaries in
an emotionally warm atmosphere through appropriate
negotiation and reciprocity, is shown to be
the most effective (Gray and Steinberg, 1999). It
has the best long-term outcomes in terms of a
child's self-control and parent-child harmony. It
is apparent from this research and professional
practice that there are wide variations, even in
the West, in child management styles, dependent
on social class and children's temperaments,
although the wider appeal of the liberal and
child-respecting views remains. However, as
comments by Frosh (see chapter 7) and some
glimpses of religious fundamentalist approaches
to child-rearing show, child management based
on religion may be narrowly culture-bound.


Children are not simply passive respondents to
parenting practices. They actively shape their
parents' behaviour towards themselves. Chess

Although the contributions of the foregoing
principal researchers have had a profound impact
on the cultural perception of parenting process,
they are largely propelled by theoretical concerns.
Patterson's contributions are of quite a different
order. For him the practice of sorting out
child and family difficulties was the starring point
that led to theoretical formulations. For over three
decades, he and his associates have identified
parameters and processes of parent-child interactions
among difficult and antisocial children
(Patterson, 1975, 1982; Patterson and Forgatch,
1989). <i>Coercive family processes</i> entail inconsistent
and unrewarding actions of parents in the
face of children's challenges, creating a cycle of
negative action and reaction. Patterson and colleagues
have systematically utilized <i>social learning
theory</i> to demonstrate how such processes are
generated and maintained but, more importantly
from a therapeutic point of view, how they can be
altered by good-quality interventions. This work
serves as a model of relevant, real-life, theoretically
rigorous but practically useful research and
accessible writing, attested by its discernible
and wide-ranging impact on parenting support
and education programmes. The contributions by
Smith and her colleagues in chapter 15 of this
volume provide an updated account of this work.


Finally, Rutter, alongside his distinguished epidemiological
work and studies of much child and
family psychopathology, has drawn attention to
<i>vulnerability and resilience</i> as major overarching
factors that are both affected by and affect the outcome
of parenting practices with children (Rutter,
1985, 1999; Rutter et al., 1998). Children's susceptibility
to hurt and their ability to withstand it
are clearly key factors in determining the outcome
of parenting under adversity which affect so many
children, even in developed societies. All clinical
practice with disordered children and families has
to concern itself with the evaluation of these complex
factors in both parents and children. In
chapter 5, Kaplan and Owen set out the many
facets of these concepts, where parenting practices
are of central importance.


Understanding parenting practices and the
outcomes drawn by the foregoing luminaries and
their associates is complex enough, but the picture
has been hugely enriched by many other
researchers and professionals who have explored
the byways of parenting practices and factors
associated with them. Although it is the most
natural, historically well-established and robust
activity, the current view of parenting is one of
almost infinite complexity. Exploration of parenting
is now a veritable industry, with full-time
writers for publications on parenting and regular
features in professional journals. There are
numerous local and national organizations concerned
with research on and promotion of parenting.
Depending on their level of development,
many countries have, or are in the process of
placing, 'parenting support' at the heart of their
social policies, as shown by Utting and Pugh in
chapter 2 of this volume. All this activity is not
without its critics, either on empirical grounds
(Harris, 1998) or from the political view that this
is an aspect of state 'nannying'.


What all the research and professional activity
has achieved is to support the clear message that
parenting is <i>the</i> crucial process and transmission
mechanism in shaping children's future. The slow
recognition of this by politicians is being matched
by the academics waking up to the necessity of
making their work more socially relevant as a wider
view of child development (Lerner et al., 2000).


<b>THE CONCEPT OF PARENTING</b>


'Parenting' may be defined as <i>purposive activities
aimed at ensuring the survival and development
of children</i>. It derives from the Latin verb
'<i>parere</i>' - 'to bring forth, develop or educate'.
The older function, <i>in loco parentis</i> ('in place of
parents', assigned to teachers) well conveys this
latter sense. The use of the verb 'parenting' is as
recent as the noun 'parent' is old. As a concept,
it seems largely confined to Anglophone countries,
though there is evidence that its use may be
spreading to other countries (Hoffmann, 2002).


The word 'parenting', from its root, is more
concerned with the <i>activity</i> of developing and
educating than <i>who</i> does it. In modern parlance,
however, 'parent' denotes the <i>biological</i> relationship
of a mother or father to a child. We
qualify it by such words as 'adoptive' or 'foster'
parents, 'parent surrogates' or 'carers' to keep
the biological relationship distinct. On the other
hand, the verb 'to parent' (or, more commonly.

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As parents get older, the age and power differential
with the children which defined their status,
becomes less stark. Care-giving roles are gradually
equalized and then reversed, with most children
adopting an increasingly 'parental' role, ensuring
the safety and welfare of their elders. The concept
has now been extended to the wide-ranging social
construct of 'corporate parenting', not only concerning
commercial firms looking after their
employees, but also of public authorities' responsibility
for children who have special needs and
whom they look after (Department of Health,
1998). Given that even people who have no
children of their own are somebody's child, brother
or sister, aunt or uncle, almost everyone engages in
'parenting' activities. As we shall see, given the
core elements of the process, the whole structure of
'social control' - formal and informal - can be construed
as being an aspect of a 'parenting society'.


Thus, when we look at its reach and significance,
'parenting' emerges as probably the most
fundamental and universal concern of society. It
acts as the 'connective tissue' - the most prominent
form of universal altruism which joins up and
cuts across nations, generations, social classes,
ethnic groups and religious or political creeds,
where commonalities are overwhelmingly greater
than the differences. Our sympathy for children in
war-torn or disaster areas is an instance of this
fundamental, universal parenting sentiment.


The biological connection of parents and children
was fairly straightforward until the introduction of
'artificial reproductive technologies'. In this new
discourse, legal definitions of who is a parent are
complex and the complications arising from them
far from resolved (Bainham et al., 1999). Pryor
addresses some of these complexities in chapter 8 of
this volume. Our concern here in this chapter and,
indeed, the whole of the book is with the <i>activity</i> or
<i>process</i> of parenting, neither of which presume a
biological or age relationship. Thus, parenting is an
activity that normally involves the children, parents
and other family members in lifelong interaction. At
each stage of development, participants have different
conceptions of themselves as children, mothers,
fathers and other care-givers. These views are
affected by the context in which they operate, both
within the family and outside. Issues of 'selfconcept'
and perceptions and presumptions of identity
affect both the motivation of parents and of
children's response to parenting, as brought out in
many guises in the following chapters.


<b>DIMENSIONS OF PARENTING</b>


A notable feature of the large literature on parenting
is the absence of dogmatic pronouncements
and attempts at grand system-building that
are evident elsewhere in the social sciences. The
hallmark of this literature is recognition of the
wide diversity of parenting practices, their complex
and changing content, and the need to treat
parents and children as particular. And yet, a
coherent <i>discipline</i> can only develop if the main
elements of the structure or parenting are identified
and communicated.


A number of authors, such as Bronfenbrenner
(1979), Belsky (1984) and Furstenberg (1985),
have attempted to identify the theoretical elements
of parenting. Based on these and much
related work, it is possible to propose a conceptual
framework of parenting (Hoghughi, 1997,
1999) that allows an evaluation of parenting
practices in individual families, as well as the
construction of parenting support programmes.
Though clinical in origin and application, it may
be useful in structuring much of the literature on
parenting and considering directions for needed
research.


In the present context, parenting processes are
defined as <i>activities that are specifically aimed at
promoting the child's welfare</i>. In turn, this can be
subdivided into parenting activities, i.e. the core
elements of necessary and sufficient parenting;
<i>functional areas</i>, i.e. the main aspects of child's
functioning on which they focus; and <i>prerequisites</i>,
i.e. what they need in order to do their job.
Between them, these provide an evaluation grid
for determining parental <i>capacity and competence</i>,
as a basis for supportive action and a 'conceptual
map' for generating research and
scientific discourse.


<b><i>Parenting Activities</i></b>


Parents do many things for and about their
children, in a multitude of contexts, throughout
their common lifespans, aimed at promoting

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>CARE</b>


'Care' comprises a cluster of activities aimed at
meeting the <i>survival needs</i> of children. The work
of Kellmer Pringle (1980) and others has identified
a cultural consensus about what constitutes
the 'needs of children'. These encompass not
only the physical or 'tissue deficit' needs, such as
food, warmth and shelter, but also emotional
(such as love) and social needs (such as responsibility)
at different developmental stages. In
some countries, many of these are incorporated
into laws regarding protection of children and
promotion of their welfare. Thus, 'care' can best
be seen as being concerned with factors that
increase the child's resilience in the face of
adversity and promote positive development.


<i>Physical care</i> includes all activities aimed at
ensuring a child's survival by providing such
basic necessities as food, warmth, cleanliness,
sleep and satisfactory elimination of bodily
wastes. It is also critically concerned with prevention
of harm through accidents or preventable
diseases, and if harm should occur, then providing
early remedial attention.


Both systemic problems (such as poverty) and
poor parenting practices result in significant proportions
of children not receiving adequate physical
care and protection. Even subhuman species
generally provide adequate survival care. What
distinguishes humans is that when we can, we go
beyond this to enhance or optimize the child's
state. This is evident in the diversity of food and
clothing given to children, and extensive attempts
to keep them in good physical shape. 'When we
can' is the operative phrase, since even in
advanced societies, families at the margins cannot
meet some of the basic physical care needs of
their children. Puckering deals focally with this
and related issues in chapter 3 of this volume.


<i>Emotional care</i> involves ensuring that the
child is not unhappy through anxiety, fear or preventable
trauma. This entails giving the child
respect as an individual, a sense of being unconditionally
loved, and opportunities for managed
risk taking and exercising choice. Its aim is to
create stable and consistent positive interactions
with the environment - chiefly other human
beings but also the physical environment - which
enable it to form secure, predictable attachments
and create an optimistic orientation towards new
experiences.


<i>Social care</i> is aimed at ensuring that the
child is not isolated from peers or significant
adults in the course of growth towards adolescence
and beyond. Since social relationships
have a profound impact on shaping children's
views of themselves, and the power to affect
their emotional state, they warrant close attention.
Positive social care focuses on helping
children to become well integrated at home and
school, and accept increasing responsibility
for self-management. This enables them to
recognize the worth of others and seek self-development
and enhancement through positive
dealings with others and successful task
performance.


The paramount importance of physical care as
a precondition of any child's well-being is universally
acknowledged and frequently written
into national laws. Emotional care is more
oblique and not as often the subject of focused
parental activity, but it is something to which
public agencies, such as social services and
health clinics, are increasingly alert, as, for
example, when a child is deemed not to be 'thriving'.
Social care does not have a high profile and
is rarely considered even by attentive parents.
However, in the newer and more coherent parenting
support programmes, such as Sure Start
(Department of Education and Employment,
1998; see chapter 2), increasing attention is being
paid to children's emotional and social care.
There may be other care needs for the child, such
as 'spiritual' needs, but these are neither directly
related to any objective survival of the child or
generally agreed upon. There is little doubt, however,
that in some cultures (and fundamentalist
sects) 'spiritual care' is considered to be as vital
to the child's 'soul' as food is to the body (see
chapter 7).


The outcome of good care is a healthy and thriving
child, attachment by the child to the parenting
figure(s), and the development of a firm and positive
sense of self. This is the core foundation of
self-esteem. A well-cared-for child will be, within
genetic and constitutional limitations, healthy,
emotionally resilient and socially competent, with
the capacity to explore new opportunities.


<b>CONTROL</b>


Control comprises the range of activities concerned
with <i>setting and enforcing boundaries</i> for

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Control activities are guided by a complex
interaction of parents' personal predisposition
and cultural expectations. Such aspects as toilet
training and going to school are regarded as
'unnegotiable' and almost universally applied.
Others, such as table manners and spending time
outside the home, on the other hand, are regulated
and enforced less uniformly. A complication
is that this most 'legal' of areas, often places
ambiguous expectations on parents in terms of
what they must/may and must not/may not do.
Issues of care, being literally more vital, are more
clearly defined in legal terms.


The central importance of the need for control
becomes clearer as children grow older and interact
with 'authority' figures, and as they become
stronger, more mobile and prone to getting into
trouble. Their increasing physical and social maturity,
greater sense of self, and increasing autonomy
renders them more problematic to control. These
issues become most acute in adolescence when
peer influences are at a peak (Warr, 1993). Parents'
attempts at control are complicated by their own
history and the type of control they experienced,
their belief in the efficacy of particular methods of
control, and their style of making their wishes
known and gaining compliance. Parents with a
harsh childhood history may just as likely reject as
adopt the idea of behaving similarly towards their
own children. In many countries, such as the UK,
parental discipline is coming increasingly within
the public purview. Parents are held publicly and
legally accountable both for their children's (antisocial)
behaviour, and for their own questionable
attempts at control (see chapter 2).


In the West, because of the ascendancy of liberal
views and respect for the individual, parents
are increasingly advised to 'negotiate' boundaries
and sanctions with their children, as appropriate
to their ages and circumstances. There is,
however, no consensus regarding the level and
kind of boundaries appropriate for difficult
children, how they are to be enforced, and with
what consequences for breach or observance
(Forehand and Long, 2002).


In the past, there were class-related standards
of behaviour and sanctions, which have largely
disappeared. Now, the more complex and pluralistic
the society, the greater the uncertainty
appears to be about what is 'appropriate
behaviour'. At present, the only limited consensus
seems to revolve around basic toilet habits,
attending school, and prohibition of serious property
offences, violence against the person and
certain forms of sexual behaviour. Social and
legal tolerance do not always coincide. What was
previously predictable in terms of social class is
no longer so, as witness the wide-ranging use of
alcohol, drugs and young sex across classes. It
may be unfair of wags to say that 'parents don't
any longer raise their children; they simply
finance them', but certainly parents are increasingly
unsure of where to draw the boundaries in
the face of incompatible pressures.


Setting and enforcing boundaries for children
involves the whole complex psychology of shaping
behaviour (Patterson and Forgatch, 1989),
mixed with changing cultural and ethical considerations
of what punishment or coercion is
acceptable. This issue is likely to remain volatile
and provocative. The already prominent (and in
many Western societies largely autonomous)
adolescent culture is likely to trickle down to
younger ages, where children will challenge
parental controls. This will demand increasing
sophistication from parents in the way they set
and enforce boundaries for their children. Given
that most children behave in a culturally appropriate
manner suggests that parents are adapting
their approach to shifting social dynamics. On
the other hand, the apparently greater involvement
of young people in a spectrum of 'proscribed'
acts, from drug-taking to serious
delinquency, suggests that such adaptation is at
best patchy.


<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>


Development activities are driven by parents'
wishes for children to fulfil their potential in all
areas of functioning. It is not essential to a
child's survival (as in the case of care) or social
functioning (as in the case of control). It is
implicit in every act of encouragement or creation
of new opportunities by parents. The formal
social system, as funded by taxpayers, also
provides a wide range of opportunities for
promoting children's cultural awareness, skill

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The political thrust to this area comes from
concern with social justice. Access to economic
resources is a major determinant of whether
and how children develop their reflective and
appreciative capacities in artistic, cultural and
environmental matters generally, where poorer
children suffer undeserved loss. This is the core
reason for the ever more explicit push towards
'social inclusivity' in access to culture, irrespective
of race, gender and socio-economic level.


In addition to the 'instrumental' aspects (such
as sports and education), perhaps the most
important parental task in developing their
children is the inculcation of values (Grusec et al,
2000). There is an understandable reluctance to
prescribe values, other than in religious texts
about parenting. But allowing for cultural and
personal preferences, in pluralist societies such
values include tolerance, wisdom, courage, fairness,
inquisitiveness, temperance and respect for
the equal worth of others, irrespective of their
differences.


Good developmental opportunities for
children result in their capacities being fully
explored through experience and expression.
They are 'stretched' legitimately and absorbed in
socially approved and worthwhile activities,
imbued with values and a sense of self that are
both adaptive and rewarding.


<b><i>Functional Areas</i></b>


Parenting is not a single generic activity but one
made up of numerous elements involving every
aspect of the child's functioning. Parents themselves
do not make distinctions in regard to what
they do at any given time and their activities
seamlessly flow from one area such as feeding,
to another such as playing, and one activity
almost invariably fulfils more than one purpose.
However, from a professional viewpoint, particularly
for purposes of parenting education and
support, it may be desirable to separate out the
areas of children's functioning that require
parental attention. This volume focuses centrally
on four major areas of children's functioning, as
described below.


The classification adopted here is the simplest
necessary for analytical purposes. It is not theoretical
or diagnostic, but one that seems to work
in research and practical settings where work
with parents and children is paramount
(Hoghughi, 1992). The areas of functioning
cover physical health, intellectual and educational
functioning, social behaviour and mental health.
Each of these areas encompasses the functioning
of the child across the lifespan, from the newborn
to the adult and beyond.


• <i>Physical health</i> involves all aspects of the
children's physical state, survival needs and
optimization of well-being; physical
features (as in deformities); developmental
state; physical, motor or sensory disorders
and others that are physical in origin, such as
Down's syndrome. The focus of parental
activity is thus prevention of damage through
neglect or harm, reactive care in the event of
difficulty, and the provision of opportunities
for positive growth. The importance of good
parenting in this area is highlighted in
chapters 11 and 12.


• <i>Intellectual and educational functioning</i> and
problem-solving skills are essential for effective
survival. Activities aim at utilizing a
child's potential for acquiring intellectual
and educational and work competencies. As
shown in chapter 13, considerable evidence
points to the incomparable power of parental
support in enhancing children's educational
functioning.


• <i>Social behaviour</i> covers all aspects of
responsiveness to social cues and the ability
to develop and respond appropriately to
social relationships. In the course of growing
up a child becomes aware of and learns to
relate to a widening world of people and
social circumstances. Parental focus on a
child's social development facilitates appropriate
responses to increasingly complex
demands. Even more critical, however, is the
recognition and internalization of cultural
and legal norms of behaviour in regard to
person and property. Learning to observe
social distance and sanctity of persons, as
well as respecting other people's property
are the critical outcomes. When such learning
is deficient or deviant, a child may
disregard social boundaries or others' property
and may be impelled to violate their
persons. Unchecked non-observance or the
active breach of rules leads to a pattern of
antisocial or delinquent behaviour, with significant
costs to the child, family and
society. This is why there is so much emphasis
on child management in parent training
programmes, as shown particularly in
chapters 15 and 16.


• <i>Mental health</i> encompasses all aspects of
children's thoughts, feelings and behavioural
tendencies towards themselves and others. It
includes major personality variables, as well
as clinical conditions (such as anxiety and

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>OPERATIONAL PREREQUISITES
OF PARENTING</b>


Depending on the quality of family relationships,
parenting can be a lifelong activity. Given the
preciousness of children to most parents, there is
a sense of commitment and responsibility which
is most demanding. What is true in all strata of
society is that having children is expensive. Only
the rich do not feel the economic pinch of having
children (HM Treasury, 1999). Nor is parenting
a purely private activity; it is a publicly recognized
function, supported in developed societies
by relevant fiscal and social welfare policies.
Despite this, only recently have politicians
recognized that financial provision is by itself
not enough to ensure good-quality parenting.
Economic resources are necessary for 'good
enough' parenting but they are far from sufficient
- as can be seen in some of the dysfunctional
families of the rich.


Parents need extensive and varied resources to
carry out their complex tasks, which change
according to context. It is, therefore, not possible
to give an exhaustive inventory. Nevertheless, in
the interests of an integrated framework, an elaboration
of classes of irreducible and indispensable
prerequisites of parenting seems worthwhile.
These include knowledge and understanding,
motivation, resources and opportunity.


<b><i>Knowledge and Understanding</i></b>


Knowledge and understanding are concerned
with parents' abilities to recognize focally their
children's 'needs' through the lifespan, arising
either from a deficit in the child or the urge
for positive enhancement. A parent has to
understand what the child's behaviour/condition
signifies before responding appropriately to it.


Knowledge and understanding are the essential
starting point of active parenting. They entail
recognizing the child's state, interpreting it
appropriately, and responding to it adequately.
Parents do not come to their task totally devoid
of knowledge; they bring to it a range of beliefs
and competencies which are the result of their
own socialization (Smetana, 1994, 2000), including
any explicit learning about child development
and the evolving, intimate familiarity with
their own child. The knowledge element presumes
the presence of acquired 'facts' about
children in the functional areas previously noted
and any 'needs' arising from them (e.g. 'she is
crying, so must need feeding'). These 'facts' are
culturally shared and validated with 'evidence',
scientific and otherwise, variably percolating
into the culture. This is a well-established part of
most parent training and support programmes.


Apart from meeting 'ordinary' needs (such as
food and warmth), parents are also often
involved in 'risk assessment'. This is often done
at lightning speed when the child is unwell or
otherwise at risk. However, as the child grows
older and matters other than pure physical health
come to the fore, so the process of risk assessment
becomes more complex and demanding, for
example, in deciding whether a teenage child
should be allowed to go to a late-night party.
Risk assessment requires both child-specific and
cultural knowledge. It also has to consider, critically,
the costs of both a 'yes' and a 'no' decision
for all concerned. This aspect of parental activity
is not rigorously developed in training and support
of parents, other than in the case of specific
physical or mental health problems.


<i>Understanding</i> implies a reasonably accurate
and comprehensive <i>interpretation</i> of the child's
state. Although knowledge and understanding
are only relevant and <i>useful</i> when allied with
appropriate action, conceptually and practically
they can be separated - as for example in a
depressed mother who recognizes a child's distressed
cry but cannot respond to it (Field, 1994).
This is why immense emphasis is laid on this
area in parent training, from early antenatal care
onwards. Parents are also increasingly encouraged
to develop some understanding of the
impact of their own relationships and the quality
of home atmosphere on children's behaviour
(Wilson and Gottman, 1994).


Another critical element is 'assessment of
impact', i.e. whether the intervention in response
to a 'need' has had the desired effect. As with
'assessment of need', the complexity of this
process also increases with the condition, age

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Motivation</i></b>


Parents' own socialization gives them some
knowledge of children's condition and corresponding
needs. However, knowledge by itself is
arid and neutral unless translated into action. To
act on knowledge requires <i>motivation</i>. Motivation
concerns parents' wishes and commitment to
do whatever is necessary to maintain or improve
their children's state. They acquire this motivation
in the course of both their own and their
children's growing up, in keeping with their personal
need and social support for having children.
This aspect warrants considerable elaboration, as
it is often cursorily or tangentially treated in the
parenting literature (Hoghughi, 1997).


Much is known technically about physiology,
development, temperamental and personality
correlates of motivation and how it is affected by
different circumstances. Clinicians have a wide
array of therapeutic measures for improving
motivation at physiological, cognitive, affective
and behavioural levels. And yet, it remains the
most fragile aspect of human behaviour, at the
mercy of sometimes minute social and personal
changes of fortune. It is the 'black hole' of psychology,
where much otherwise learned and
high-quality clinical practice comes to grief,
because we simply fail to motivate the 'patient'
or the 'client' to adopt effective ways of coping
with whatever is at issue, in this case 'parenting'.


Motivation for parenting entails elements of
the biological urge to have children; cultural
pressures; personal and social support for parenting;
and constraints on it (Eggebeen and
Knoester, 2001). From a historical and evolutionary
perspective, most parents have looked
after their children as best they could, most of the
time. They have had to make considerable sacrifices
in order to bring up their children. This is
particularly true of women in terms of their
health, mobility, wealth and opportunity to
achieve personal ambitions. For some children,
such as the handicapped, the sacrifice has to go
on, more or less, through the common lifespan of
the child and parent.


Although most parents still give their children
the highest priority in principle, it is obvious that
in practice significant compromises have to be
made in reconciling their own personal needs
with the requirements of being a good parent. For
example, most women start separation and
divorce proceedings in the knowledge that there
will be some damage to their children (Emery,
1999). Thus, focus and priority given to children,
which seem to be critical factors in high-quality
parenting, are not invariable. They have to take
their place in a hierarchy of needs and pressures
in parents' lives.


Each parent has four roles and corresponding
tasks: <i>self, partner, children, work</i>. Given the
demands, conflicting burdens and complexity of
each one, it is a wonder that so many families
survive and do as well as they do. Currently, the
most prominent problem of women's motivation
in developed societies concerns their role conflict
as mothers and workers (Hoffman and
Youngblade, 1998). Until quite recent times,
most mothers worked in the house, where
children also stayed and interacted with them
continuously. Now there are multiple reasons -
financial, social and personal - which push or
pull women to outside work. The barest minimum
consequence is that they now have less
time with their children. Other things being
equal, inevitably they are not as physically close
to their children as if they spent all their time
with them. They are also frequently so fatigued
or distracted that they are unable to give their
children the 'quality time' they desire. The
money they earn is inadequate compensation,
since only some of it goes towards the child
and does little to alleviate the cumulative stress,
compounded when children are unwell or other
family factors clash with work commitments.


Much of what men and women bring to their
parenting depends on the quality of their own
relationship. The impact of this on parenting is
either 'additive' (when it brings additional
warmth and love) or 'subtractive' (when it brings
tension and distress). Further, each parent may
have a 'cellular' and separate approach to parenting
(e.g. harsh father, indulgent mother) or they
may adopt a joint and co-operative approach to
their children (Fletcher et al., 1999). Greater rates
of family break up are but one indicator that parenting
is subject to increasing pressure from this
quarter, as it is from many others (Cummings and
Davies, 1994; Wilson and Gottman, 1994; Amato
and Booth, 1997). The increasing and high prevalence
of single parenting presents a range of additional
pressures (Fundudis, 1997).


For men, the picture has changed less, though
the increasing complexity of fatherhood is now
recognized in an ever-growing research and professional
literature (e.g. Burghes et al., 1997;

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As is evident, therefore, the motivational
element for focused, high-quality parenting is
vulnerable to major social and personal pressures.
And yet, in parent training and support programmes,
hardly any explicit attention is paid to
motivation, which so fundamentally influences
what parents do (Barlow, 1997; also see chapters
3 and 20 in this volume). The available literature
suggests that the main issues affecting motivation,
both at the wider social level and in individual
families, include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Social role and identity: how should men and
women reconcile their personal aspirations
with those of being a parent?

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

• Work and its demands: how will new and
emerging labour market dynamics affect parenting
tasks?

authority when increasingly the state sets

may not do, with and to their children?

families with the host culture and avoid conflict

<b><i>Resources for Parenting</i></b>


Academic disciplines such as social policy and
sociology, national politics and clinical practice,
have all dealt with the issue of resources for parenting.
Indeed, the historical origins of concern
with parenting can be traced back to the recognition
of poverty, its impact on families and child
development.


Early studies reflected the view that socio-economic
adversity 'caused' inadequate and inappropriate
parenting practices and poor outcomes
for children. However, from the 1930s onwards,
an alternative view emerged suggesting that
socio-economic adversity and poor parenting
practices were themselves associated with poor
genetic and constitutional endowments, and that
socio-conomic status was only one manifestation
of such differences. Although genetic differences
among parents and children are recognized,
claims of their paramount role in parenting are
now seen as no more than deeply held prejudices.
Poverty continues to be regarded as a major
impediment to parenting, not least because of the
personal and social factors that are associated
with and result from it (Kumar, 1993).


The concept of 'resources' has not been philosophically
well explored. It denotes <i>everything</i>
that parents need, want or desire to deploy in
raising their children. Thus, it becomes obvious
that finances for obtaining goods and services are
but one set of resources. Others must include
psychological and social <i>competencies</i> of parents
and the wider familial and cultural <i>environment</i>
on which they draw. When present and of adequate
standard, these are all major and invaluable
aids to parenting. The core resources for parenting,
apart from finance, all of which are necessary,
include qualities, skills, social network and
materials.


<b>QUALITIES</b>


Qualities are parental behaviour tendencies that
arise from fundamental personality characteristics.
Other things being equal, they predict the
manner in which parents approach their task,

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Apart from the general and the common sense,
little is known empirically about the interactive
consequences of one or more personality characteristics
for parenting. So we cannot say, for example,
how parenting will unfold for an intelligent
but emotionally cold mother, as opposed to a
warm but not very bright mother. The main requisite
qualities highlighted in parenting literature
appear to include warmth, intelligence, stability
and communicative ability, as well as freedom
from serious physical and mental health problems.


<b>SKILLS</b>


The ability to parent effectively is not inborn, as
is evident in much parental incompetence across
the ages, cultures and psychosocial conditions.
Although the motivation to have children is
rooted in biology, human evolution has meant
that there are no universal, inborn response
pattems (apart from matemal lactation and other
biological features), or competencies readily
available to parents of new children. These,
therefore, need to be acquired and are what, in
this context, are called 'skills'. They also go
from low to high, with one skill often facilitating
another. They are acquired both <i>formally</i> (such
as through classes in schools, maternity units and
specific parenting programmes) and <i>informally</i>,
through parents' own experiences, trial and error
with their children, observing other parents or
through the media.


Skills are required to meet the physical, emotional
and social care needs of the child, to set
and enforce behavioural boundaries, and to communicate
with the child; persuasive ability is
needed to gain resources, and management skills
are required to make best use of them. The more
complex the society and the more specialized the
needs of children (as of the chronically ill or
handicapped), the more complex and specialized
the parenting skills necessary. A wide range of
such skills, both general and specialized, are
addressed in parenting training programmes
(Smith and Pugh, 1996). They are extensively
addressed in this volume, particularly from
chapter 11 onwards.


<b>SOCIAL NETWORK</b>


The personal qualities and skills of parents are
often augmented by the presence, involvement
and responsiveness of other people, in the form
of a network of relatives and friends, extending
to other social groupings and the culture at large.
Supportive people surrounding the parents are a
significant source of empowerment. Parents who
are visible to and integrated with benevolent
social networks have, in general, much better
child outcomes than those who are not, as happens
in 'socially excluded' families (as shown in
many of the chapters in this volume).


One of the longer term consequences of industralization,
population mobility and changing
family dynamics has been the gradual erosion of
family ties in developed countries. Whereas at
one time (as still in many developing countries)
children would have had the benefit of integration
into and parenting by extended families
(Belle, 1989), they are now relatively isolated
and face the unleavened impact of parental incapacity
or incompetence. Public services provide
some relief, but only <i>in extremis</i> and then often
with all the limitations imposed on resources and
a lack of real emotional involvement with the
family.


<b>MATERlAL RESOURCES</b>


Material resources are generally interpreted as
the money, goods and services necessary for raising
children. They include food, clothing, housing,
medicines, toys, educational materials and a
multitude of services dictated by the prevailing
standards of society. Much evidence is available
showing the profound impact of inadequate
material resources on parenting practices and
thus child outcomes (Elder, 1985; Garmezy and
Masten, 1994; Duncan and Brooks-Gunn, 1997).


The mass of evidence shows that family
poverty is the single most powerful predictor of
subsequent disadvantage and vulnerability in
health, education, family stability, antisocial
behaviour and mental health of children.
However, the issue is complex, with many subtle
consequences and questions about 'direction of
causality'. Variations in quality and content of
parenting within the same band of economic
adversity have different outcomes for children
(McLloyd, 1998). To this extent it is not only
financial poverty itself (though that is bad
enough) but also its effect in creating a 'culture
of poverty' that seems to be the main source of
long-term damage. The 'genteel poor' make
extraordinary efforts to compensate for the
effects of material poverty and work hard to
manage their resources well and not appear poor.
On the other hand, those who have always been
poor develop a sense of hopelessness and fatalism
which is even reflected in their very use of
language, such as 'restricted code', passive

This state of poverty appears to be akin to and
associated with a low-level clinical 'anxiety-depression'
which saps parental energy and diffuses
the effort they make on behalf of their
children, as can be seen in daily clinical experience.
Certainly, even in the UK, which is rich,
some parents go hungry sometimes, in order to
feed their children (Elder, 1985). Many cannot
afford toys, 'sweet money' or other things that
growing children 'need' and regard as essential
(Long, 1996; Gordon et al., 2000). This is even
more prominent among new economic migrants
and refugees than the host population, where
poverty is already significant.


<b><i>Opportunity</i></b>


Parents need time to do their parenting. This is so
obvious as not to need belabouring and remains
generally the least problematic and most readily
available of all prerequisites for parenting.
However, in developed societies, particularly in
the rapidly evolving Western cultures, this is
now an issue. Traditionally, mothers have been
responsible for the care and control of their
children in the early years. Fathers, when in
employment, have provided the material sustenance
and the funds for support of the household.
With rapidly changing economic circumstances,
increasing numbers of women have entered the
labour market to work, full- or part-time. The
time they spend at work cannot be spent with
their children. Because the industrial context of
women's work most often precludes taking
children with them, the children have to be cared
for by nurseries, child-minders, relatives, friends
and others.


Research evidence on the impact of mothers'
work on parenting and child outcomes is as yet
ambiguous and provides support for diverse
interpretations (Hoffman and Youngblade,
1998). For some families, working mothers
bringing in additional money and pursuing fulfilling
jobs, creates a more rewarding environment
for their children and, therefore, child
outcomes are better. But many mothers find the
demands of work and parenting frequently
incompatible; they are often tired and stressed;
they are unsure of the benefits of working when
so much of their income has to be spent on childcare;
children get a very varied (though by no
means often adverse) quality of alternative care;
and outcomes for younger children, in educational
and mental health terms, may be less favourable.
And, of course, there is even less contact when
parents are hospitalized, incarcerated and working
in distant locations.


<b>MAJOR CONCERNS IN
PARENTING</b>


Issues of current concern in parenting range
widely, both in the wider culture and within individual
families. An overview of parenting literature
identifies certain themes of persisting
concem, though the list would no doubt vary
according to author. These themes include the
following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Parenting and poverty</i> There is little doubt
that good-quality parenting helps some
children find a route out of poverty.
Overwhelming, high-quality evidence suggests
that relative and subjective poverty, particularly
in many highly unequal societies in the
West, is an endemic, corrosive influence. In a
major and apparently growing section of
society, even the best parental efforts are compromised
by the undertow of failure to achieve
what the rest of society regards as necessary
and decent. This creates a culture of daily
struggle and fatalism with low expectations
and erosion of hope, which in turn leads to
poor care and control of children (Department
of Education and Employment, 1998). That so
many children turn out reasonably is a testament
to their parents' extraordinary efforts and
their own resilience. No society can hope to
promote better parenting without simultaneÃº
tackling family poverty, its correlates
and consequences. Awareness of this problem
is not often matched by success of measures
taken to combat it.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• '<i>Work - life' balance</i> This is clearly a wider
concept than parenting, as it applies to all
persons who work. It is now evident that
in market-driven, Western societies, full
employment and expected high standards of
living through high output targets, pressurize
parents to work ever harder. The increasing
entry of women into the labour market has not
taken any work pressure off men. It has
placed greater demands on women themselves,
who still have to do much of the
parenting job, on top of the demands of their
employment. Even where good childcare and
other aids are available to a minority, the subjectively
experienced demands on parents are
increasing.
</p>
<p>

The exigencies of jobs and the consequent
fatigue are not understood by the children,
who continue to demand attention from
parents. Parents' awareness of their own
needs and the different needs of their children
create a conflict of priorities which can often
be only partially resolved. The resulting guilt
and frustration, sometimes compounded by
difficulties with the partner or lone parenthood,
do not improve matters. In terms of
social evolution, we do not yet appear to have
adequately resolved the emerging conflict of
man/woman, partner and worker roles with
that of the parent.

As economic and work pressures on
parents are unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable
future, parents need urgent and systemic
help towards better evaluation of options and
practices. More focused and transparent exploration
of the issues is needed, as well as greater
availability of help to working parents.
Highlighting what constitutes 'good enough
parenting' under the prevailing social conditions,
and identifying any help available, may
reduce conflict between the needs of parents
and their children. There is little reliable information
about how best to do this, forcing
parents to improvise as they go along.


• <i>Children in public care</i> All societies have
children who cannot be looked after by their
parents and who require substitute care. The
more developed the society, the more some
children appear likely to be looked after in or
through public care. There are children who
cannot be fostered or adopted and who present
the greatest 'conglomeration of impairments'
in physical and mental health terms,
education and social behaviour. Their histories
of disadvantage start before birth and
continue through varieties of unsatisfactory
care which precipitate moves from one caregiver
to another. Because of this, they fail to
develop adequate attachments and suffer
confusion about where they belong, with
attendant anger and anxiety about the shifting
demands of adults. Those entrusted with
looking after them, though sympathetic,
often lack the skills to give them the necessary
levels of care, control and opportunities
for development. More importantly, they
cannot give them much realistic hope for a
better future.


A number of countries are attempting to
legislate for and set in place high standards of
public care (Department of Health, 1998).
However, the reality lags significantly behind
the intention, and prospects for these
children, both as persons and as probable
parents, are not improving. There is an urgent
need to find new and better ways of parenting
such children. This is not only for their sakes,
as after all, they did not ask to be born, but
also to mitigate their impact on society and
on their own offspring.


• <i>Parental v peer influence</i> One of the possible
consequences of parental preoccupation with
work is that children come increasingly under
peer influence from middle childhood
onwards, even setting aside developmental
changes. This is already a major factor in
older children's behaviour. In some families
and socio-economic strata, this influence is
greater than that of parents, particularly
where antisocial behaviour is concerned.


Little is known about how to enable
parents to exert real control over their teenage
children's behaviour in the face of powerful,
'pleasure-driven' peer influences, as evident
in the spread of drug taking (though see
chapters 15 and 16 in this book). With the
continuing fragmentation and atomization of
families, the need to address this issue will
become ever more urgent.


• <i>Parenting in minority and migrant families</i>
There is now an unprecedented movement of
peoples across countries - in the form of
migrant workers, refugees and others who
find themselves resident in different cultures.
Although there is much homogeneity of
dress, behaviour and parenting practices due
to globalization, nevertheless sufficient cultural
specificity remains to create significant
tensions in both host and minority populations.
The assertion of separate identity (for
example in the dress of some Moslem girls in
Western schools) and exertion of parental
authority and custom (such as arranged
marriages with someone in the 'home' country)
are all sources of possible tension between
the two.


Despite uncertainties about trends, the
mixing of peoples and cultures is likely to
continue and even accelerate. There is a need
to address this issue systematically in order to
reduce tensions and enable integration without
loss of cultural identity in parenting practices.
To allow organic, laissez-faire
evolution is an option, but not a good one if
we do not learn from it and use its lessons to
facilitate better parenting.


• <i>Parenting and mental health</i> What parents
do with their children is fundamentally
shaped by their own mental state - not just
the impact of possible abnormality, but also
their sense of tranquillity and self-efficacy as
persons and parents. All the evidence available

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite considerable research, little is
systematically known about how parents with
mental health difficulties can be helped to
mitigate the impact of their problems on their
children (see chapter 17). Often work on
parenting support is rendered ineffective by
parents' mental condition. Any substantive
work in this area is likely to produce disproportionate
benefits.


• <i>Parental support across the social spectrum</i>
As almost all the chapters in this book indicate,
considerable effort and resources have
been expended on developing parental support
programmes. The emphasis on economic
and other disadvantaged groups is understandable.
Yet, as the following chapters also
indicate, our knowledge and professional
competence in providing effective parental
support is patchy and, judging by its results,
often unhelpful in the long run.


Maybe this is the best we can reasonably
expect in complex societies. After all,
parental difficulties are often hidden and parenting
practices not subjected to scrutiny
until something goes wrong. But society as a
whole, and individual, powerless children
pay a heavy price for inadequate or deviant
parenting. We need much more focused,
practice-orientated evidence about how best
to support all parents, but particularly of the
types mentioned in chapters 19, 20 and 21, in
rapidly evolving social environments.


• <i>Research into parenting</i> All the above
sections identify the need for more knowledge
and evidence and thus research. This
book presents a sample of the huge amount of
information available on parenting. Much
other information is not usable because it has
not been produced with a view to utilization
in practice.


Parenting is an applied, rapidly evolving
activity. Much better practice-orientated
research is needed to help support it. We
have enough basic information regarding
'facts' and 'blue sky' topics in parenting to
feel safe in re-orienting and promoting
research into practice and its improvement.
Work towards a better conceptualization of
the 'dos and don'ts' of parenting in different
social and family settings, in response to
particular pressures and conditions, is the
prime candidate for such work.


The effort is warranted, because it would
not be too extravagant to claim that there is
nothing more important for society than to
raise the next generation and do it better.
