BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, [PATIENT NAME], well your hair does look good.  She's right.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, thanks.  I just had it, had it colored.  Got to cover that gray.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, I understand.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I just don't color mine.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, this is my real color cause I don't really love that gray coming out.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, no that's all right.
<b>PT:</b>	No, gray doesn't look good on red hair not so much.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's true.  My wife has this brown and gray and the gray's all very even throughout it, so it's like a frosted.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, how pretty.
<b>DR:</b>	So she just leaves it.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, mine was like that too.
<b>DR:</b>	You're too young for that.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm 40.  That's not young.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah it is to me.
<b>PT:</b>	You're not that old, [PHYSICIAN NAME].
<b>DR:</b>	How you doing otherwise?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, well I started school.
<b>DR:</b>	DJ school?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Connecticut Broadcasting School.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, had a little anxiety about it.  I go 2 nights a week, Monday and Wednesday from 6 to 10, and yeah, had a little anxiety attack about it 'cause just the whole like possible failure, and like oh God, I'm like I really want, 'cause I really want it and I'm really, you know, I'm good at it, but it's like oh God, it's pressure, you know, that type of thing.  Well, I ended up calling [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Remember I was seeing him?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When the DUI stuff was going on.  Well, it still is.  I mean I don't really—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's in appeal.  I don't know [INAUDIBLE] I haven't talked to him in a year, you know, but and I called him.  I guess no news is good news.  Got to look at it, you know.  License is still valid.  Everything's still fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just hoping that, 'cause it'll be 4 years this summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you're lost in the system or—
<b>PT:</b>	Something.  I don't know.  It was appeal.  He had to get Lakewood 'cause they're appealing it.  The state is appealing it, and they're like they want to like, I don't know.  They want to use me as an example for some reason, and I mean [NAME OTHER] said that some of the laws need to be changed per se 'cause people like that have ADD or ADHD, those sobriety tests, we can't really, we don't follow direction very well.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's a good point.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh 'cause he saw the video.  I've never seen the video never to this day, and he was like [PATIENT NAME] it doesn't show someone intoxicated.  It shows someone impaired like not getting what the officer is telling me to do and he told if we have to go to court and I have to get up on the witness stand, he wants me off of my medication.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	Because he seen a difference in me from messages I've left him all upset to when I've been put on my medication.  There's a big difference.  I mean I see the big difference too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  Like the week you were on vacation.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh my God, you were on vacation.
<b>DR:</b>	A couple of weeks ago.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh my God, [PHYSICIAN NAME] oh Lord, I told Nancy [INAUDIBLE] my messages.  I mean they weren't like you could tell, you could hear the anxiety, you know, like all panic because I ran out of medication.  I ran out and Publix wouldn't fill it 2 days early because it was filled on the 6th and they wouldn't fill it on that, they would not fill it.  It was like the 2nd and he would not fill 4 days, like a couple of days early.  So I like had a left over Ritalin that I took and I could tell it worked on my emotional level big time.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh God, I was a basket case.  I was a basket case.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, was it the small 1s?  Maybe it just wasn't doing anything.
<b>PT:</b>	The Ritalin was the 30 mg.  No, I took 2 of those [PHYSICIAN NAME].  So I had 60 in me.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	So, the Vyvanse is better?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, Vyvanse is better, but the problem is is that because I ran out of the Adderall, well I've been taking, um, I only have 6 pills left of the Vyvanse that I just got filled because I've taking it in the afternoon.
<b>DR:</b>	You take it twice?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You can do that, but it's a lot 'cause it's the 70s, right, didn't you tell me?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't, I need it, like I take it in the morning, but I notice that like I took one right before I came in here 'cause I see that it starts to wear off and I start getting like kind of fidgety.
<b>DR:</b>	What time this morning did you take it?
<b>PT:</b>	This morning what time did I take it?  Uh, it was about 6:30, 7.
<b>DR:</b>	So, that's, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	So at 6:30.
<b>DR:</b>	Seven hours you're getting.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Because if I don't, like then like 8 or 9, 8 o'clock at night I start like sleepy.  I want to go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's, maybe that's when it's really wearing off.  Do you think it would be wearing off and you sort of crash?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's like I'm not motivated, like I don't want to do anything, and also I've been noticing too like with, like in the mornings like I don't want to get up.  So, like it's like I'm not like I'm still tired, but I think—
<b>DR:</b>	Not getting enough sleep you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's just a combination of a lot of things going on with me because like I said I called [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  I had a panic attack, a full blown panic attack, and luckily it was 2 Wednesdays ago.  I called him at 5:30 in the afternoon and he actually and he was on vacation.  I didn't know he was on vacation.  He just happened to be in the office, and she was able to put me through and he was able to, um, I told him the panic attack [INAUDIBLE].  I was really, you know, having an anxiety attack.  He, the room that I was in, a picture that I had on the wall, he asked me to describe it in detail like into what I saw.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Well no, but see the funny thing is is I have a girlfriend that's going to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] that teaches rebt, R E B T, didn't know that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] used to be partner with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	He teaches the same thing, and my girlfriend has been talking to me about it, and she's like not everybody gets that, gets the, and I do, I understand what he's, our fears come from us, not from somebody else.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean somebody else may bring that out in us, but we already have that.  That comes from something that stems from—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it may even be heredity.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true, but I, um, so I went—
<b>DR:</b>	So that calmed you down you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I talked to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he was like, and he said well, I told him, I said, you know, about fail, you know, like failure and he's like he goes did you steal my crystal ball out of my office?  I was like, I didn't quite get the concept right at the moment.  I'm like no, and he was like, he goes exactly.  He goes exactly, he goes you can't predict the future and neither can I.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	And so, and I told him, I said I was honest with him, I said you know, there's times when I get where I feel like I need a little help and I call and I'll make an appointment with you, but then when, when the time comes for me to go to that appointment, I'm fine and I don't need, and I call and I cancel, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But my problem is, and I know what it is, is that I'm so used to controlling and like I told [NAME OTHER] it's like I'm not looking to control a person, but it's the situation that I want to control, and if you're not doing it the way that I think that you should, then, then that's where this little bit of this neediness that I kind of of comes out of me which it's been way, cut way down I mean 'cause I'm not, I'm a very independent person.  My, my best friend, she's like [PATIENT NAME] she goes I'm independent, she goes, but you put me to shame because I don't ask for anything and I guess there's a little bit—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Of this neediness which comes with that control issue with it, is it's something that I need a little help with.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Here's the help.  The fact that you can control things is just an illusion.  You know, it's a wish.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not true.  And the people who win in life, and this is what you got to start working on, are those that can adapt to what's going on the best whether it's a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Usually I can.  Usually I can.
<b>DR:</b>	In the room, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	But I think what it is is like in, like with a person.  What I told [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is that now I'm coming with me and the age that I am, I, I want to have that security, that I want to have someone in my life.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And there is somebody, but it's not quite going the way that I would like it to.  So, that's where that control and see to someone else, it may not look as controlled.  It may look as being needy, and I'm not that way and I don't like being that way because I'm not and then that drives a person away.  The more that you want something from somebody and the more that you keep after them, are they going to give that to you?  More likely not.
<b>DR:</b>	No.  Nobody, it might be that nobody should give you everything you wish for.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	No 1 person.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm not saying that.  It's like, as I was telling [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] says, you know, it's like 'cause I've had boyfriends in the past that had family and I was always incorporated in that family.  So, it's like and that's what I want.  I want that again, and I want that with a particular person that's in my life, but it's not progressing the way that I want it to.  So, that's when I become that needy, naggy kind of person that I, like whoa, where did you come from.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, so you got to control that.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly, and the thing is is I thought I could do it by myself, but I can't right now, and so that's why, you know, I went to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and, um—
<b>DR:</b>	So you went back?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  I went back to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and he told me that he was going, like he said I don't need to see you every week, every other week is fine, and he's like [PATIENT NAME] he goes I want to give you the tools that you need to be able to deal with these things because I don't, because I don't want to go to someone that I've got to go to therapy the rest of my life.  I want someone that's going—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	I want someone like that.  That's what my friend was telling me about rebt, I'm like okay.  I want someone that teaches me how to deal with things that maybe pop up in my life that maybe bring out those little certain things that I have.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm going, and I need to be able to learn how to cope with it and deal with it, whereas before I didn't, and I would just kind of react.
<b>DR:</b>	No, it helps to have some—
<b>PT:</b>	Some tools.
<b>DR:</b>	Almost set thing, yeah, right.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	That you can go to.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's what I like about, you know, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is like you know I've explained some things to him about a particular relationship and he's like, and you know, and he's like well, you know, he goes you got a lot going on with school and everything and you know and you know, if you have a good sex life or whatever with the person, great, you know.  He goes if you choose to do that with him, that's, you know, fine.  That's your choice and he says, but you also have to know that you need to accept if you're willing to do that, you need to accept these things about this is how this person is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know what, and he's right.  I'm not looking to change someone, but I'm like looking to like kind of like maybe mold you so you can maybe adapt to me a little bit, and you can't do that.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	You can't.
<b>DR:</b>	The people that last together usually marry.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Adapt to the other's idiosyncrasies let's say.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, and I have.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of times that means ignoring them.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	Or not getting angry about it.
<b>PT:</b>	And I have, and I—
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it's don't take it personally.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly, and sometimes I would.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I would—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure you did.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, and I would and then I would lash out or whatever, and then that's not very pretty on me, you know.  It's not and it's like okay, who wants to spend time with someone like hey, what's that.  And so I have to look at it—
<b>DR:</b>	What messes up sex more than anything else in the world, anger.  So you don't want that.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, and you know, and so I just have to like you know [INAUDIBLE] this person.  He goes about things a little bit slower than I do.  I mean he hears me and he processes the things that I say or whatever, but he goes about it in his way of processing things.  Whereas, I'm like okay and I, I can't be like that.  I mean it was 2 years yesterday we've been seeing each other, and I'm like so I can't, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Go adapt to the way he is.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  And I mean and I like, and I mean I like a lot of things about it.  It's just that, you know, but I've also driven him away too because of some of my actions and some of the things because I want more, and I don't get more so then I'm like, and then that neediness comes out, and I'm like oh God, where does, I don't like that 'cause I've never really, I've never been a needy person.  That's the thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't see, I prefer to say it's a wish.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I wish I could have so much.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a little less [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't really like that need 'cause that needy word is like oh.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  So but it's your wishes, then you got to think well, you know, that wish is a little impractical.  I mean most wishes are anyway, but it's often said that we're wish doctors.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Well, I wish.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	But instead of saying wish that I want something when I put it out there, I say I want.  I want this.  I would like, I would like for this to happen.  I want this to happen.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Instead of saying I wish it would happen, I say I want because I've learned that positive thinking and putting it out there in the universe, it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you got to be assertive about what you—
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	Want, but—
<b>PT:</b>	It can't be just, it can't be—
<b>DR:</b>	It's can't be demanding.
<b>PT:</b>	Frivolous.  Right.  Oh, no, it can't be frivolous, and it can't be like materialistic.
<b>DR:</b>	And perfectly not, no.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't want to be a high maintenance woman.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, but I'm just saying, but you know certain things that you want like you want someone to spend more time with you.  Well, I would like for that person.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's a tough 1.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, but if you just put it out there, you know, you just put it out there and then you just go about your everyday life business, then you know what, cause I've had that.  I've put it out there and I've had it come back.
<b>DR:</b>	Well yeah, but the first—
<b>PT:</b>	You just kind of don't pay attention to it.
<b>DR:</b>	As soon as you put it out there, you have to realize okay, but it'll be a compromise.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly, and I understand that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I understand it's a compromise and I don't have a problem with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because it's kind of like a balance.  I'm getting kind of of, you know, getting some of the answers, but I've also got to like give too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	To receive, and which I don't have a problem with.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, let's figure out this medicine then.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I still think it's a better idea to have the Vyvanse 1 a day and then just the shorter acting 1—
<b>PT:</b>	See I don't like the Adderall 'cause the Adderall makes me hot.  I get really hot and it makes me sweaty feeling.  Taking the Vyvanse—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's cause Vyvanse releases more evenly.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have any of that, any of that stuff going on.  No sweatiness, no hot like, I was like I'll be hot—
<b>DR:</b>	What the hell do you want that for?
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  I know, and then I'll touch myself and I'll be hot.  I won't be sweaty, but I'll just be hot for like, I'll be hot.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's because it goes in your system and, you know, releases a lot in about, I don't know, 45 minutes or so.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And then goes slowly down.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's why the Vyvanse is a better [INAUDIBLE].  It starts releasing it and keeps it going that way.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So, that's better, but you still may need something at the end of the day some days, you know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Especially with me going to school.  It's like I need my attention level to be there and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And it won't be there like, you know 8 or 9 o'clock at night.  I'll be like okay, ready to go, but see the problem is is I only have 6 Vyvanse left from getting my prescription filled on the 4th.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, are you putting that on insurance?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I pay out of pocket for everything.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, then they should give it to you whenever you want.  It's only insurance that dictates—
<b>PT:</b>	He wouldn't at Publix, but see it wasn't the head pharmacist at Publix.  It was the other guy, and see I tried to slip it by him.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it depends on the date on it now.  If the date was 2 days later.
<b>PT:</b>	See, I got it filled, see I got it filled on the, last month I got it filled on the 6th and you had written my script for the 4th and I took it in on the 2nd and he wouldn't do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, well that's the law.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's why.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he wouldn't do it.  So what about now because I don't really have many Vyvanse left and I've already written, gotten—
<b>DR:</b>	Doesn't matter, I'll write it for today—
<b>PT:</b>	As long as the script is, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And he has to fill it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I wasn't sure how that works 'cause I was just like what, and I explained, I even explained to him.  I said look, I go my doctor is out of town.  [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] is out of town.  I tried calling him.  He's on vacation, and I'm like I have no medication.
<b>DR:</b>	That's 'cause the date on the script.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, but I was like oh.  So, what do you suggest, taking it in the afternoon then?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I mean—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, what do I take in the afternoon?
<b>DR:</b>	Those short acting 1s are going to be—
<b>PT:</b>	Which short acting?
<b>DR:</b>	Four to 6 hours.  The regular Adderall.
<b>PT:</b>	I hate the regular Adderall.  It makes me sweat.  I don't like taking it.  It makes me hot and I get migraine headaches because it gets me dehydrated because I do get so hot.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, even if you take a second Vyvanse, I don't think you should take a 70.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I probably don't need 70.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe a 50 or something.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	It's expensive to do it this way though.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  Okay, well—
<b>DR:</b>	It's up to you.  I mean.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just the Adderall makes me hot and especially with summer coming, oh God, I don't need to be sweating with that too.  I know it's expensive.  That's the only thing.
<b>DR:</b>	I'll give you 70 and the 50s.  Let me see if there was something I had that might be a discount thing.  I'm not sure.  No.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Not for this, but you can try the card again.  If it doesn't work, it don't work.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  It won't hurt, right?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know cause I'm like thinking I'm like I know it would be cheaper to do the Adderall, but it's so, it makes me just so hot.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, all right.
<b>PT:</b>	It gets me overheated sometimes.  That's what I hate.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't blame you there.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, this has already expired [PHYSICIAN NAME].  This is good through 03/08.
<b>DR:</b>	No, they're good.
<b>PT:</b>	March '08.
<b>DR:</b>	They're good.  He said they're good.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	He just gave them to me.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	We'll see if I have any later 1s.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	If they got some later.
<b>PT:</b>	Cause isn't this really for children though?
<b>DR:</b>	No, the deal there is they only got FDA approval for children.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	But that doesn't mean, that just means they did it on 5 thousand people.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Kids, and in fact, they are doing it on 5 thousand adults, but the FDA didn't approve it, but I can do it any way I want.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, I understand.  I was just wondering cause that's what I had heard.  So, I guess I'll probably be on this medication for the rest of my life, won't I?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You're like, yeah [PATIENT NAME].  It's not coming you'll be coming off.  If I would have gotten treated as a child, would I have outgrown this?
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You'd still be—
<b>PT:</b>	'Cause some people outgrow this, right?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but, uh, you know, maybe 40%, but, I mean they're outgrowing it by the time they're 17, 18, 20.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Did you son outgrow his?
<b>DR:</b>	No he really didn't.  Well, I guess he did a lot of it, but it's still, it's still there, but in certain jobs where you're always doing the same thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You tend not to need it, but he's still hyper.  I mean, Christ, he's always doing something.
<b>PT:</b>	He's what?
<b>DR:</b>	He's always doing some project or—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	He's still hyperactive.
<b>PT:</b>	Does he take medication?
<b>DR:</b>	No, he doesn't like it.
<b>PT:</b>	He doesn't like it?  You always spelled [PATIENT NAME] with 2 Ls, didn't you?
<b>DR:</b>	Huh?
<b>PT:</b>	You always spelled [PATIENT NAME] with 2 Ls.
<b>DR:</b>	That's how most people spell it.
<b>PT:</b>	That's okay, doctor.  My mother was different.  It had to be with 1 L.  Well, see with me, it's like, you know, I was telling my hairdresser today, I'm like, you know, without it, I go I would have already been fidgeting 'cause she went to make phone calls, and I sat there and wrote my 30 second commercial for school tonight, and see I wouldn't have been able to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I would have been sitting there, and I would have been like, okay, and like when she cut my hair a couple of weeks ago and it took her like 2 hours, I would have like are we done here yet 'cause I can't.
<b>DR:</b>	No, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, but see I was fine.  I sat there fine and I was like, I did my, I wrote my little commercial and I was fine.  That's why when it starts to wear off, I can feel, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  You may be metabolizing it fast.
<b>PT:</b>	I think I am.  My metabolism has really speed up lately because it's like [INAUDIBLE] like I'll eat and like a couple of hours later, I'll be, I'm like starving again.
<b>DR:</b>	Hum, even though you're taking this, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I can't figure it out 'cause I'm like this is supposed to curb your appetite, and I know some people who just take it for that, and I go well, it hasn't curbed mine, that's for sure.  I mean I eat.  I haven't gained any weight or anything, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Now, you think you'll use the second 1 every day?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well1.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	'Cause I have been taking it every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, I'll just write it that way.
<b>PT:</b>	I need to learn how to prioritize.  I don't quite do that very well.  It's because I don't have a regular job job anymore.  So, I've kind of got out of that and I don't, like I need to like some tools for like learning how to like, but then again, it's like I haven't gone back to school in years, so this is something new for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's true.  Do you have to study anything?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean like I had to write, you know, a commercial and stuff.  I mean I have to go in sometimes like on my off time, and like work on stuff too.  I mean it's not like, yeah, I mean at the [INAUDIBLE] I am.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So, I mean, you know, I mean I know how to prioritize.  It's just sometimes is like I don't always get every, I think what my problem is is I make a list of things that I need to do, and I get the most important ones done, but then the other 1s that are still [INAUDIBLE] there, I feel like that—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's all right.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I think that's what the problem with me with being overwhelmed sometimes is that oh God, I need to get, I need to get this all done.  This all has to be done now, and if it doesn't, then I'm all like stressed about it.
<b>DR:</b>	No, try to be realistic.  You say you got a list.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, I have a list every day.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, and you think, um, you know, how much time it should take me to do this one and that one.  I mean so you're, it's more than just what's written on the list.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You got to—
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I take longer with a project, something I'm doing and I just frustrated—
<b>DR:</b>	"And that too. "
<b>PT:</b>	Because it runs me behind or I have to leave it half finished.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that probably means you, you didn't leave enough time to begin with.  All right.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Probably the same.  Maybe a little less.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, cause this is already, like 70 mg is like a 100 and 30 something dollars.
<b>DR:</b>	I know.  I wish it was less.
<b>PT:</b>	And the Adderall would only be, I mean how much would you give in the Adderall?
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'd probably give you 90 for a month.
<b>PT:</b>	In the Adderall, really?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, the generic, the only cheaper thing is the generic Adderall, which is short acting.
<b>PT:</b>	I think that's what my problem is with it.  It's not long enough with me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, if you're a hyper metabolizer then.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, I am.
<b>DR:</b>	It may not be lasting as long with you like maybe it would only last 2 or 4 hours at the most it sounds.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's why a lot of times with the Adderall, I'll take it late in the day, like I won't take it until like 4 or 5 o'clock because it's like it wears off too early for me and I need it to get through [INAUDIBLE] school.  I need it to get me through until like you know, 10, 11 o'clock at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, I know you do so.
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know you're going to need something.  That's like college kids study and they, they need something else.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, yeah, but I just need it for my attention because a lot of the, when I go in and we are divided into 2 groups.  So, it's like half of the, half of the evening we're down to like we're working with the televisions like learning cameras and things like that, and then the other half is the radio part.  So it's not really for say textbook stuff.  It's like stuff that—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, I've got to be, like my brain can't be all over the place thinking oh well, it's 8 o'clock.  Who's doing what or what's going on?  I can't be like that.  I need to be here now listening and focusing on what you're telling me.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	So, and I find that this Vyvanse works with me.  It doesn't make me hot.  It doesn't make me sweaty.  I don't feel all like—
<b>DR:</b>	All right, well—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm looking into getting, getting health insurance.  It's just that, it's funny, you put one L in this prescription.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you told me.
<b>PT:</b>	You put 2 Ls.  Oh, okay, but I'm just, oh no, what was I going to say 'cause I lost my train of thought.  Oh well.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	And so, I just need [INAUDIBLE] prioritized and just kind of get, I'm starting to feel better.  I was kind of in a little funk when you were on vacation and my medication was kind of off, and then I think going and, I think the medication and then going and talking to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And kind of talking about some of the little anxiety fears that I have just dealing with school and this relationship.  That has helped me, and it's made me like not be like if something happened today like I wasn't going to see him like we thought, and I was fine with me cause he had, but I understand.  Not to say that I'm not disappointed, but you know, I mean I can verbalize that, but I don't have to be all like, you know, you know, like that.  So, you know, I think the thing more with me is sometimes hearing the word no or not, [INAUDIBLE] doesn't really no.  It's just I don't have time, and I get kind of offended by time.  You don't have time for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I don't have time to do everything my wife wants.  That's after 47 years.
<b>PT:</b>	So, and I mean and he's a good person so I just have to—
