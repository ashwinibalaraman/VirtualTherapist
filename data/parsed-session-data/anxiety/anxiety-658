"People are hell, Nicole."


That is what Dirk told me as he drove me home after I'd been
stranded at his house the night before. Another one of the endless
Great Lakes blizzards had put down two feet of lake-effect snow in
a matter of hours, and the interstates had been closed.


"Do you know who I'm quoting, Nicole?"


"No," I said as I watched the snow-covered vineyards of northern
Pennsylvania fade into the white brightness of the horizon. My
breath fogged the window of his Honda Civic.


"Sartre. You really should read some of his work."


I recount this dialogue during Psychodrama with Rachel. I

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dirk was my senior thesis adviser at Penn State Erie.


He asked me to dog-sit for him.


I said yes.


He invited me to his house after school, so I could see where
everything was and meet the dog.


It started snowing.


I had never driven in snow.


Dirk said he would drive.


I said yes.


I met the dog, saw the house.


Dirk started drinking and offered me a glass of wine.


I said no.


He tried to drive me back to Erie. The roads were closed.


He asked me if I wanted a glass of wine.


I said yes.


He told me to pick a bottle from his collection; I picked a
French red.


I drank.


We listened to Beth Orton.


I drank.


He topped off my glass.

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I drank.


He made me a dinner of pasta with clam sauce,


I ate and I drank.


I told him about the bulimia.


He told me about his recent divorce.


We both drank.


He said he was lonely. He needed friends. He was alone.


I sat on the sofa with him.


We drank.


He said he wanted to be friends.


I started crying.


I blacked out.


I woke up to his hands on my feet, then my calves, then
my thighs.


I blacked out.


I woke up propped against his shoulder, my feet on top of his.


He gave me a shirt to sleep in. It was size XXL. Eddie Bauer.
Forest green.


My white shirt was stained with red wine.


The next morning, he tells me to keep everything quiet.


He could lose his job.


I tell my friends.


I am infuriated.


I tell members of the English department.


They say to keep quiet.


He doesn't have tenure.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He could lose his job.


I report him to the sexual harassment counselor.


I report him to the head of humanities and social sciences.


He is everywhere.


He asks my friends about me.


He tries to talk to me.


A letter goes in his file.


A restraining order is issued.


I am told to keep quiet.


I am told how mature I am for not seeking revenge.


I graduate and move to Minnesota.


I don't have to keep quiet anymore.


The years of silence choke me. The first event I write about
when I move to Minnesota is the Dirk ordeal because, finally, I
can speak freely. From the night I spent at his house until the day
I graduated from Penn State Erie, my eating disorder worsened, I
was symbolically stuffing my feelings and then purging them, since
speaking about them was forbidden. Even after I move to Minnesota,
the blank spaces in my mind bother me. What happened during
the times I blacked out? Was I manhandled or raped? I believe
I would've known if I had been violated, but doubt creeps into my
mind. I was still dressed, I reassure myself. But I will never know
the truth.


I tell Rachel all of this. I tell her I want to do a psychodrama
about Dirk, because maybe that way I will be able to move on. She
agrees that it's a good idea.

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rachel asks me to arrange the room like I usually have my
classroom arranged when I teach Introduction to Creative Writing
at the University of Minnesota. I arrange all the chairs in a circle,
and all the residents, my simulated students, pick a seat. Rachel tells
the students to ask me about what books I've read. Laura asks me if
I've ever read Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>.


I say no.


"What kind of teacher are you if you've never even read <i>War
and Peace?</i>" asks Rachel.


"A perfectly fine one. No one has read all the classics," I reply.


"Everyone, I want you to pretend you are Nicole's students.
Give her a hard time about her not having read <i>War and Peace</i>, and
just harass her in general," says Rachel.


"You suck as a teacher."


"You're only twenty-three; how can you teach colleger?"


"I'm better read than you."


"Just who the hell do you think you are?"


I listen to these voices and decide this whole tableau would
never occur in real life. The classroom is one of the places where I
feel most comfortable. It is a place where I can forget that I have an
eating disorder. And I always get wonderful student evaluations.
But I decide to play along with Rachel.


"You're not good enough."


"You aren't thin."


Now my students are interjecting issues from a recent Group
Therapy session, also something that would never happen in real life.

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Rachel, this would never happen in real life. I'm completely
comfortable in the classroom," I say.


Rachel calls an end to the scene and has me arrange the furniture
in the same way Dirk's living room was arranged. I am not feeling
anything other than anger at what I deem Rachel's ineptitude. There
is no sense of catharsis in this psychodrama. Instead, I feel my cheeks
begin to burn with anger. This is not helping. Nothing will ever help.
True, I am holding backâ€”I'm not surrendering to treatment. But I've
surrendered before, and it has only gotten me into bad situations.
We act out the evening at Dirk's, with Holly playing Dirk.
Rachel has Dirk stand behind me and cover my eyes. I just
stand there, not sure what to do.


"Why don't you fight back, Nicole?" asks Rachel.


"I don't know," I reply. I know where this is heading, and I
don't like it.


<i>You are not blowing aimlessly in the wind. You have control</i>.


I fight Holly off.


"Why were you drinking?" asks Rachel.


"I don't know."


"You blacked out, correct?"


"Yes."


"Alcoholics black out."


Silence.


"I am not an alcoholic."


I am fiery with silent rage. Alcoholics are physically addicted to
alcohol. I am not.

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Would this have happened had you not been drinking?"
asks Rachel.


I am itching to punch Rachel smack in her pointy face.


"You are resisting the psychodrama; you are not letting go."


I have no response to this comment. Psychodrama ends, and
we file upstairs for dinner. RC Julia attended my psychodrama; I
asked her to come, since I thought I'd have a hard time. At dinner,
she sits at my table.


"How do you think that went?" she asks as she butters her roll.


"Terribly. I'm not an alcoholic, and I don't appreciate Rachel
intimating that everything was my fault."


RC Julia doesn't know what to say.


"That's some major bullshit," says Holly.


"What if your drink was roofied?" asks Eliza.


"I fucking hate Rachel, She has no idea what she's doing,"
says Laura.


RC Julia still doesn't know what to say. She just looks at me
with what I assume are sympathetic eyes.


"You should confront her," says RC Julia.


"I don't want to. I just want to forget about it," I say.


After dinner, I talk to RC Marie in the office. I tell her about
my psychodrama, and she says she has an assignment for me.
Intrigued, I ask her what it is. I secretly like assignments because
they make me feel like I'm in school.


"I want you to write a letter to Dirk."


I like this idea.

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I head down to the conference room with my CD player and
listen to Tori Amos's <i>Little Earthquakes</i> album, and write a furious
letter stained with my angry tears. I feel relief. I feel catharsis.
I thank RC Marie and vow to read the letter out loud in Group
Therapy the next day.


Laura talks about how she has no choices in her life, and I
fidget and sigh during Group Therapy. Finally, I interject.


"Elaine, I really, really need to read this letter."


Laura pouts and becomes silent, and I begin to read.


<i>Dirk</i>,


<i>I fucking hate you. I hate how you tried to blow the
whole incident off, how you pretended to act contrite and
said all the right things. I hate how you made my senior
year at Penn State Erie such a trial</i>.


<i>Do you know what it's like to have anxiety attacks
and be so scared that you hide in the bathroom? Because
that is what I did. And you kept trying to talk to me.
You kept trying to keep me quiet and now I feel like I'm
going to fucking explode because I'm so sick of everyone
trying to keep me quiet</i>.


<i>When you touched me, I wanted to crawl out of
my skin. I wanted to die. The thought of your hands on
my thighs makes me sick. You worked a bad situation to
your advantage and I've been blaming myself</i>.


<i>I was not the one who kept filling my wine glass, I
did not ask you or want you to touch me. I did not want
you. You violated me</i>.


<i>I'm so angry that as I write this I can barely contain
myself. And maybe I don't want to anymore</i>.


<i>Some people have suggested that you put Rohypnol
in my drink because I blacked out so suddenly. I don't
even want to think about that. I drive myself crazy</i>

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>You not only affected me emotionally, but also
academically. You were already my second thesis adviser
and because you couldn't keep your lecherous hands to
yourself I had three thesis advisers before I finished the
damn thing</i>.


<i>I fucking despise how you played innocent when I
informed you that you were no longer my adviser</i>.


<i>I fucking hate how you tried to manipulate me, how
you tried to appease me, tried to placate me</i>.


<i>I fucking hate how you stared at me while I read
from my senior thesis at the English Department Banquet</i>.


<i>And the day you pulled out behind me in the parking
lot, I thought you were following me. I want you to
know that kind of fear</i>.


<i>In fact, I want you to be stuck in the situation I was
in and wake up with some man's hands on your vulnerable
thighs. I want you to have to live with the blank
spaces in your memory, to keep trying to piece it all
together, to play the whole night on repeat in your head</i>.


<i>Most of all I want the memory of a man's hands
caressing their way up your thighs to be imprinted
in your body and mind. I want you to feel dirty and
ashamed. I want you to have to inspect your body for
bruises and signs of assault the next day</i>.


<i>Most of all I want you to question what happened
in those blank spaces, because that is what torments me</i>.


<i>Wait, I take that back. I fucking want you to
become a raging bulimic. I want you to spend days consuming
and purging. I want you to isolate yourself from
others. I want you to live on a diet of coffee, Diet Coke,
and diet pills. I want you to pass out, get concussions,
develop heart problems, and pray for death because you
are so fucking miserable</i>.


<i>I want you to move halfway across the country and
still not be able to forget</i>.



[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I want you to hate yourself</i>.


<i>Oh, and another thing, I want you to have to go
through the ordeal of filing a sexual harassment complaint.
I want everyone to try and keep you quiet. I want
you to have to tell your story a minimum of five times. I
want you to turn fuchsia each time you tell it</i>.


<i>I want the sexual harassment counselor to tell you
how fucking mature you are because you are cooperating
and keeping a secret when in reality you want to tell the
whole school. I want you to be pressured into signing all
the forms</i>.


<i>I hope I never have to see you again. If I do, I will
stare you down. You have no power over me now</i>.


<i>So this is all I have to say for now. I'm done being
scared and now I'm fucking pissed. You're lucky we're
not in the same state because if I was, I'd slash the tires
on your lame-ass Honda Civic</i>.


<i>I'm done keeping secrets. I'm tired of taking one for
the team and being the peacemaker. That's not me. It
never was. The cost of keeping quiet was too high</i>.


<i>I'm done with you</i>.


-NICOLE


As soon as I finish the last sentence, everyone shouts and
exclaims that my letter is awesome. RC Allison is especially proud.
She jumps out of her seat with a big smile on her face, and I think I
detect tears in her eyes. Everyone hugs me. My anger has dissipated,
at least for now.


Later that day I talk to Rachel about how angry Psychodrama
made me.

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You made me feel like an alcoholic, and like what happened
that night was my fault," I say.


"I want you to see that you aren't helpless, that you have control
over your life. I don't want you to wallow in victimhood."


"I understand that, but you went about it the wrong way."


"You could have told me to stop; you have the power to do that."


"I didn't think it worked like that," I say.


"The power is always yours," says Rachel.


I try not to hold a grudge against Rachel, but I have lost trust in
her. I am skeptical of her methods, and of Psychodrama in general.
