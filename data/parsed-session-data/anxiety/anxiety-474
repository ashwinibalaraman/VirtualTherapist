BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So how things been going?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So, what's up for today?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm just reviewing medications, see if there's anything need to talk about.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what we, where we start.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Review what we did last time?
<b>DR:</b> That would be fine.
<b>PT:</b> My attitude towards the weather is the problem.  No perfect place to live.  [INAUDIBLE] has a moderate climate.  I have to accept what I have, then we can be happy, weather and life, weather and life, job, job [INAUDIBLE] have to learn how to accept the weather where we are.  How do I learn to accept the weather whatever it is doing.  Some people like the weather.  Others like me, don't like dark clouds and zero degree temperatures make me very nervous.  We have to learn, learn how to accept the weather whatever it is doing.  Find ways that that will.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Very good.  And how do you feel like you've been doing with that?  Do you feel like you've been managing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, managing, managing.
<b>DR:</b> Not getting the better of you [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] better, I mean, just basically staying in when clouds are dark and going out when it's nice.  Usually we go on our hikes early in the morning or around 6six, around 7:30, 8:30 in the morning before clouds build up in the afternoon.  But now that we're getting into September and October, it's gonna be less and less.  But then it's gonna be doing the other.  Gonna be getting colder and colder.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we're about of thunderstorm, but now we're coming into snow season.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] snow season.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Does the snow bother you as much as the lightening?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, it does.  If it stays, if it gets really icy, you know, black ice.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  So what about, does, um, does hot weather bother you as much.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, sort of.  I got air conditioning so, you know, I can stay inside.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I got air conditioning.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  At 1 point you talked about maybe moving to, I think, Mississippi or somewhere.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was.
<b>DR:</b> It wouldn't get the snow, but they've got hotter more humid weather in the summer.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I still might move down there, but I have to see how things go.
<b>DR:</b> That's still something you're considering as an option?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] thinking about, talking about some place in Chicago also.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now Chicago certainly has the, similar kinds of weather problems we have here, cold winters and thunderstorms.  What's the advantage of being back there?  Do you know?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  She just knows, maybe knows somebody back there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] trying to find out [INAUDIBLE] where I can take some tests where I'd have to go, before I can go to [INAUDIBLE] take some tests.  Find some places where I can take those tests.  There's this 1 guy who was gonna do it, but turned out to be no good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> There's a guy that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] suggested but he just -
<b>DR:</b> Wasn't any good.
<b>PT:</b> Wasn't any good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how's your mood or your spirits been lately?  Feeling up or down or somewhere in the middle?
<b>PT:</b> In between.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I probably could use another refill on those tablet, not, not the [INAUDIBLE] but the
<b>DR:</b> The Remeron.
<b>PT:</b> Remeron.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not right away, just so I do run out, I have 1 more refill.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Yeah, I can call in and make sure that we have extra refills for whenever you need them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not the [INAUDIBLE] but the - 
<b>DR:</b> Remeron or Mirtazapine, they probably call it.
<b>PT:</b> Mirtazapine, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So are you sleeping okay at night.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, some nights good.  Some nights bad.  Like last night was 1 of the bad nights because I'm a big Bronco fan.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> And they lost.  They win by a field goal and next week they lose.
<b>DR:</b> They actually won.
<b>PT:</b> No, they lost yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Did you hear what happened?
<b>PT:</b> No, they lost in overtime.  They, I saw game from the beginning to end.  They, they, they, Broncos got the ball first and they, in overtime, they, they went 3 and out, then the Raiders got the ball, drove down the field and kicked the winning field goal.  And that was it.
<b>DR:</b> And did you turn the TV off then?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME], there was a surprise ending.
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> The Broncos had called time out before the field goal.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> It didn't count.
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> The field goal that the Raiders kicked didn't count.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> So they had to re-kick it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> He re-kicked it.  He missed.  He hit the upright and they, it did, so the Broncos got the ball back.  They marched down and scored a field goal.  They won.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.  I didn't know that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It was a surprise ending.  Everybody thought the Raiders won.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> And then they cut away and then they came back and said no, [NAME OTHER] had called a time out before he kicked so he had to re-kick it.  And when he re-kicked it, he hit the top of the upright, it bounced out and didn't count so Broncos got the ball and marched down and won.  It was a surprise ending.  So they won.
<b>PT:</b> They won 23- 20.  The Broncos won 23-20.
<b>DR:</b> It was a big shock to everybody.  Okay.  It was an amazing ending.
<b>PT:</b> I immediately turned off the TV.  I assumed that the, that they, that the Raiders had kicked.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the referees -
<b>PT:</b> It looked like it went right through the upright.
<b>DR:</b> It did.  And the referees signaled it was a good field goal.
<b>PT:</b> And that's why I turned off the TV.  I figured, it's over with, you know.
<b>DR:</b> It looked like it was.
<b>PT:</b> As soon as the referee put it up, it's over.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And they lost [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, everybody assumed that that was the end of the game, but it turns out, it wasn't because they said that the, they said a millisecond before he kicked it [INAUDIBLE] called timeout.  And so the field goal didn't count.
<b>PT:</b> So just like last week a millisecond.
<b>DR:</b> I tell you - 
<b>PT:</b> Two weeks in a row.
<b>DR:</b> They're trying to give everybody a heart attack, I think the way they're playing.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, but you were upset about that and didn't sleep so well last night.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but then I learned and I'll sleep better tonight.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so hopefully you'll get a good night sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Also change all my, I keep track of the scores of all these things, I keep the scores on.  I have to change them back.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can look in the paper today, they have a whole story about what happened so
<b>PT:</b> 23-20 Broncos all right.
<b>DR:</b> In overtime, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In overtime.  I know it was overtime, but
<b>DR:</b> It was a wild finish.
<b>PT:</b> So now they're 2 and 0.
<b>DR:</b> Yep, they're actually 2 and 0.  
<b>PT:</b> And they really needed to win that game 'cause it was a division game.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> And so, so I still have
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a wild 1.
<b>PT:</b> A wild 1.
<b>DR:</b> So things like that though can affect your sleep if you're excited or upset about something.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel like the [INAUDIBLE] are helping you sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're helping me sleep, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's if I don't cough out and I have to go hunting for them.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes the pop out and I have to go hunting for them on the floor.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.  Now are you still taking 3 of them at bedtime?
<b>PT:</b> Three of them at bedtime.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> And what about, uh, are you feeling very nervous or anxious during the day or not too bad.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I just, if I could find someone who could take me hiking on Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> There just isn't anybody available right now that can take me hike on Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> Now this is the new counselor that came with you today?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  She's taking [NAME OTHER] place today.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, just today.
<b>PT:</b> Just today, right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And what's her name?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Oh, what is it?
<b>DR:</b> If you don't remember, it's okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Have you worked with her before?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I'm just thinking if, I mean, maybe if you keep [INAUDIBLE] maybe 1 would be available on Saturdays.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.  [NAME OTHER] says that she's available and she likes to go on hikes with the mountain club, but there haven't been any easy mountain club hikes lately.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> Have you - 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] when the weather starts cooling off.  I'll just have to keep asking her.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever gone with the mountain club?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, several times.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you like going with them?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But some of their hikes are just pretty tough on you?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Pretty tough.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, hopefully you'll find someone then that you can work with.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So the anxiety level isn't too bad?
<b>PT:</b> Not too bad.
<b>DR:</b> Less than it was before?
<b>PT:</b> Less than it was before.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> It's just having to get through, I'm with her, you know, just a few hours then with [NAME OTHER] just a few hours on Sunday.  But now that I got the Bronco games, you know, weekends are gonna start going by fairly quickly now, college games on Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a favorite college team you're following?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, just any of the big, any of the big powerhouses.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> The big powers like you, you'd think like last year with Notre Dame, you think Notre Dame would be a big powerhouse this year, but they lost zero, the first time I can ever recall them being shut out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're 0 and 3 I heard on the radio this morning.  They're really struggling.
<b>PT:</b> I know and I guess they got all their senior graduating.  They just don't have the same players from 1 year to the next and they just don't, can't do what they, you know, like Ohio State and, you know, Michigan, all those other ones that are big powerhouses.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Okay.  So at least you have sports to look forward to on the weekends.  That's good.
<b>PT:</b> And once this hot weather goes away, I'll start feeling better, but then I have to start getting ready for
<b>DR:</b> The cold.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I won't like having to stay inside especially when there's ice outside.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how do you feel like you're doing with concentration?  Are you able to focus pretty well or is it hard?  Do you get distracted easily?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] concentrating fairly well.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.  Um, are you getting some enjoyment or pleasure out of doing things like going for hikes and [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I enjoy going out with hikes with counseling, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I enjoy being out with other people.  Like there's a [NAME OTHER] concert coming up in a couple of weeks and there's just no one to take me [INAUDIBLE] when the kids go see him, but there's just nobody, but I could go, but this 1 counselor's willing to take me, but I have to go by myself.
<b>DR:</b> She wouldn't go to the concert?
<b>PT:</b> No, 'cause she's planning on going on a trip.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER], she's planning on a trip and she can't afford it.  It's just really no fun to go by yourself, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I was hoping to take a book of his and go backstage afterwards and get him to sign in and have him take an extra long time so maybe I'll just have to watch the San Diego game instead.  I'd have to choose one or the other.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I guess I'll just stay home and watch the San Diego game.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now [PATIENT NAME], are you, excuse me, are you having any intrusive thoughts, thoughts that come into your that you can't get them out?
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.  No.  Every once in a while and boy, I climb the walls, but his is now and them.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you having any thoughts that get stuck in your head and go over and over and over again?
<b>PT:</b> Mm, not too much, no.
<b>DR:</b> Not too much.
<b>PT:</b> Not too much, no.
<b>DR:</b> Less than you were before?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] less than it was, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about, are you hearing any voices that other people don't seem to hear?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no.  I'm not that crazy.
<b>DR:</b> No, I think you're doing a lot better and doing better so, um, what about when you go out, are you feeling pretty safe or do you 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> feel like people are trying to bother you or
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> mess with you.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, I'm safe.  Yeah, everything
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.
<b>PT:</b> is cool that way.
<b>DR:</b> Anything that you're feeling compelled that you have to do over and over and over again?  Any certain routines?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, there's certain routines, going to bed, you know, brush your teeth, you know, just certain way of going to bed every night.  I'm sure everybody has their own routine.
<b>DR:</b> In the bed routine gets broken up or interfered with, do you just start over or do you pick up where you left off.
<b>PT:</b> Pick up where I left off, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Okay.  All right.  And now, are you still seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] regularly?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I gotta see him again on the 8th.
<b>DR:</b> And how often do you meet with him now?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, once every month or so.  I don't know if I'm gonna see him again after the eighth or not, it depends on what he says.
<b>DR:</b> So things are going better, well enough to
<b>PT:</b> Better than worse, yeah.  I think they're going better.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you think you may not need to see them for a while.
<b>PT:</b> I may not have to see him again.  Just have to see what he says 'cause he's, you know, he's the doctor, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's like you are.  If you say I have to come in again in another couple of weeks, I'll come in again in a couple of weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Just whatever you're, you're, you're the 1 that can judge whether a person needs to get [INAUDIBLE], you know, how often you need to see them.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.  [PATIENT NAME], how often do you have a counselor coming over to see you.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I see, I see [INAUDIBLE] come by 2 or 3 days a week.  And I see [NAME OTHER] just on Sundays.
<b>DR:</b> So 3 or 4 days a week.
<b>PT:</b> Three or 4 days.  Then I volunteer at a thrift store a couple of days a week.
<b>DR:</b> I didn't know that.  Is that new?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've been, something I've been doing just so I won't be bored on days when we don't have counselors.
<b>DR:</b> Now which store do you volunteer at?
<b>PT:</b> At the 1 over there by where the old grocery warehouse used to be, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you, I'm sorry, you said you did that how often?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, maybe twice a week, but maybe have to cut down to once a week 'cause I was, there on Wednesdays it's hanger day and it's really a 2 person job and they're making me do it for 1 person.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> When you go out, you first have to go out and collect all the hangers, empty hangers.  Then you have to take them back and sort them out, the different sizes and on this rack.  Then when this rack if filled up, you have to make up boxes and put the hangers, put the hangers in different size boxes, into boxes so it's just, it just gets too much just for 1 person to do.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So
<b>DR:</b> So that's what you do 1 day a week.  What do you do the other day?
<b>PT:</b> Sort shoes out to different sizes.  Just get a whole box, bins of boxes, bins of shoes and they have to be sorted out so they, each pair is matched up with his mate.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Put a rubber band around them and then put them in another bin.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, so you've been doing that a couple days a week.  Are you enjoying it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I enjoy the shoes, but not the hangers.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So is there a way you could just do the shoes and not do the hangers or
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, I could just go in on Fridays and, and maybe just start going to movies or something on Wednesdays or something.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just call, what I can do is call the lady on Wednesday and, do you need me today and [INAUDIBLE] oh, we're just doing hangers, and okay, I guess, no I guess I won't come in, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] more than just a 1 person job and tell her she can find somebody else to help me, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, it's just, just too stressful for 1 person to do by themselves.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is there anything else you'd like to do? [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, what I really like to do is have a career job like everybody else so I can do traveling, you know.  'Cause 1of my goals in life is to set foot in all 50 states and all 5 continents.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> But I just don't think that's every going to happen.  That's my lifelong goals to set foot in all 50 states and all 5 continents.  The hardest day would be Hawaii out there in the middle of the Pacific, but I just don't think I'm ever gonna have the money or, 'cause I have to, I would've had to have gone to college and gotten a career job and - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> You know, to pay for the airfare, hotels and everything.  It's awfully expensive these days.
<b>DR:</b> Very expensive.
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, just like that probably not gonna happen.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So any other goals that you have?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I just hope I get a job somewhere, someday, somewhere, but problem is I either the job gets to be too stressful or I walk out because I don't like the job anymore and that's not good to walk out.  But there's just no perfect job for me 'cause you know, there's just nothing that I really, really like doing.  Or I get bosses that are just too, just demand too much, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> Like my first job was at a Taco Bell and he got on me for facial hair.  He wrote me up twice for facial hair.  The way I shave, I did my best on shaving, but he wrote me up twice for that.
<b>DR:</b> He didn't think you shaved well enough?
<b>PT:</b> Well enough to him.  I was doing the best I can, but he still wrote me up twice for facial hair.  So, you know, some bosses you can please.  In my last job, I was finishing up too soon, you know, so, you know, like I ended up walking out of that 1 because I'm doing it as slow as I can, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Which job was that [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that was over here at Giant Village.  I was being the cleaner person, but I was doing it the best I could, still I was finishing up too soon and they said you should take more time.  I wasn't rushing or anything, but I was just finishing up too soon and they didn't like it.  [INAUDIBLE]  I ended up walking out so now I'm just, I'm in between jobs again.  I just don't know if there is ever gonna be a perfect job for me anywhere.
<b>DR:</b> Well, even if there's not a perfect job, would there be a job that would be a good enough that you'd enjoy it.
<b>PT:</b> I just don't know if there would be 1.  They're rebuilding the Kings Supers you know, they're tearing down the old Kings Supers over here in [INAUDIBLE] maybe get a job there, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> See what they got.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever tried applying at Safeway?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think they want people who first start there late at night.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They give the first, the jobs, they want to start out the new people just to see how if they can manage, you know, if they can manage, and they give the better jobs, better hours to the older employees.
<b>DR:</b> I see.  Okay.  Well, we just have to look and the only other thing that I can think of, we talked about this, but I think you weren't too excited about it was that, um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember that?
<b>PT:</b> I might call them 1 of these days.
<b>DR:</b> The good things that they have to offer [PATIENT NAME], what they usually do first is see if you qualify for their services because if you do, it's a state funded agency, it doesn't cost you a penny.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But they can do a variety of things from, um, they have job coaches that can go with you to different jobs, make sure everything's a good fit.  They have, they can retrain people to do different kinds of jobs.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> They can really try to find a job that fits your needs and, uh,
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I guess I'll look in the phone directory for their phone number.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want me to see if I have their number?
<b>PT:</b> You have their number handy?
<b>DR:</b> I used to have it, let's see if I still do in my computer.
<b>PT:</b> Do you still have their number in your computer?
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's see.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> No, I don't have it here.  Uh - 
<b>PT:</b> I'll just look in the business section when I get home, uh, how do you spell rehabilitation?
<b>DR:</b> R E H A B
<b>PT:</b> R E, what?
<b>DR:</b> H
<b>PT:</b> H
<b>DR:</b> A B
<b>PT:</b> A B
<b>DR:</b> I L
<b>PT:</b> I L, T I O N?
<b>DR:</b> I T
<b>PT:</b> I T
<b>DR:</b> A T
<b>PT:</b> A T
<b>DR:</b> I O N.
<b>PT:</b> I O N.
<b>DR:</b> I think I got that right.  Let me see if I got a phone number for them here.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, maybe you have a phone number [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if we could find it.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> It'll be a little easier.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] something close by.  I don't want to have take 2 or 3 passes is the problem.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  State.  Here we go.  Here it is, [INAUDIBLE], um, [PHONE NUMBER] 
<b>PT:</b> [PHONE NUMBER] 
<b>DR:</b> [PHONE NUMBER]  
<b>PT:</b> [PHONE NUMBER]
<b>DR:</b> [PHONE NUMBER]
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] and what's their address?
<b>DR:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> [ADDRESS] 
<b>DR:</b> [ADDRESS] 
<b>PT:</b> [ADDRESS]
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [ADDRESS] 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it doesn't give the Zip code.
<b>PT:</b> [ADDRESS] 
<b>DR:</b> Yes, you can try giving them a call.  In fact, if you want me to, I can give them a call right now and see what you have to do to make an appointment.  Do you want me to check for you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, probably just, I think like 3 weeks notice, I think that's what they said.
<b>DR:</b> You talked to one of the, okay.
<b>PT:</b> No, I think that's what, I think you called the last time and I think you have to give them 3 weeks notice.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they're usually a little backed up just to get in, but once you get in,
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, I've seen them help people in a lot of ways.  I've seen them pay for someone to go back to get a college degree.  I've seen people, uh, get job retraining.  I've seen them job coach where they go with someone to a job and help them make sure, and if it's not a good fit, they'll help you find a different job.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So they can
<b>PT:</b> Tell I need something within walking distance of where I live.  There just isn't anything much around where I live.
<b>DR:</b> Well see, even if it's not walking, if it's, you know, a simple bus ride, they might be able to find something.
<b>PT:</b> You know, but I don't care to have to stand out there in the freezing cold temperatures or thunderstorms.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I understand, but then if you're walking too - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Or if you limit the places where you walk to then it limits your - 
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> options.
<b>PT:</b> I know it.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause you live on Academy and [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> No, on Academy and Cambridge.
<b>DR:</b> [INADUIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Over there by McDonald's and [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> So that's, I was thinking about, somewhere like the library, but that's not walking distance.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Or even -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Or even the Target.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is the Target walking distance?
<b>PT:</b> I can get to Target, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Have you ever applied there for a job?
<b>PT:</b> No, I need someone to help me 'cause they have one of these computer terminals.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yes.  And that's where again [INAUDIBLE] rehab might be able to help you with something like that.  So -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] computer terminal.  I don't really know how to use it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> The computer terminal thing.
<b>DR:</b> And they even have classes too sometimes like in computers.  They might be able to help you that way too so there's several possible ways they might be able to help you out.  I think they even help with transportation sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I'm not positive about that, but I believe they might so, so it's worth maybe-
<b>PT:</b> Give them a call and say I need some help in finding a job.  I don't drive.
<b>DR:</b> See if maybe they can help you out.
<b>PT:</b> Help me out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it'd be best to find some resources in the community.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] like I need a job like more than just minimum wage, get a job [INAUDIBLE].  So somehow, someday, I can go on these big trips I want to go on.
<b>DR:</b> That would be nice.  Although, I'll tell you, it's hard to start below, above minimum wage.  You can start at minimum wage and kinda work your way up a lot of these jobs.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I know, I want a job that pays more than minimum wage 'cuz I definitely want to see the world.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> Want to get out.  Like the biggest trip I've done so far is, I've gone up to Canada once so I have gone through the Vancouver airport.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> And I slept on board the ship while it was going through the Inland Passage.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>PT:</b> So, I've been in sorta, so I've been sorta in a foreign country 'cause the Inland Passage is still part of Vancouver.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I've never actually stepped foot on dry land in a, I guess, yes, I have in Vancouver airport, but I never slept in a foreign country.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, hopefully you'll -
<b>PT:</b> Uh, other than, other than sleeping on board ship while I was going through the Inland Passage.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that's the only, that's the biggest trip I've ever done.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I hope you get a chance to go, but like you said, it's probably gonna require getting a job where you can save up some money from it.
<b>PT:</b> I know it.  That's why I need a job that just pays more than minimum wage and where am I gonna get 1 of those.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well [INAUDIBLE] is probably the best place to start.  Hopefully they can help you so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So we talked about work.  We talked about, uh, how you're feeling, um, your time with people, what about medication.  Do you feel like the way the medicine's working now, it's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Just call in another refill on those -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> On those
<b>DR:</b> Mirtazapine.
<b>PT:</b> Mirtazapine, they're at Safeway so when I do run out, I have a refill here on 'cuz it says 0 refills on my bottle [INAUDIBLE] go ahead and give me a refill.
<b>DR:</b> I'll take care of that for you [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, what else?  Have you been in touch your sisters lately?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I, yeah I just talked to my other sister [NAME OTHER] yesterday so we're trying to get back together again, but we'll probably never see other eye to eye unless it's at my nephew's wedding 'cuz maybe he'll be getting married this coming summer.  But that's a possibility.  They haven't set an actual date yet.
<b>DR:</b> And you might be able to fly out for the wedding?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, fly out for the wedding, but that's just a possibility.  They did announce their engagement.  That's as far it's gone so
<b>DR:</b> Do you know, uh,
<b>PT:</b> I don't know when it's gonna be, but it's gonna be up in Seattle.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, but they don't know the date yet or anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> But they're thinking about this coming summer?
<b>PT:</b> They're thinking about sometime this coming summer, but they don't know the day or anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Would you like to go up for the wedding?
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.  It could be another state I could add to my 50 states.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How many have you been in so far?  Do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Maybe 25 or so.
<b>DR:</b> That's pretty good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Okay, so you got that to look forward to.  Anything else you're looking forward to right now?
<b>PT:</b> Getting a job, I guess that pays, something that I enjoy doing that I won't walk away from, I won't get fired from.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I just don't know if there is such a place where, 1 where I can get along well with my boss and everything, where everything's just
<b>DR:</b> Works well.
<b>PT:</b> works well, but I just don't know if there is such a place.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  [PATIENT NAME], what about any other hobbies right now besides you mentioned hiking, you mentioned watching sports on TV, anything else you enjoy doing?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, there's this latch-hooking thing I'm doing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  And do you work, do you get like the kits like at Michael's or [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, my sister [NAME OTHER] sends me some.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What about things like, my wife saw an advertisement for a radio controlled airplane.  Do you think something like that would be fun?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.  Or collections of any kind?  Do you like collecting coins or stamps or
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> anything like that?
<b>PT:</b> No, I've not much space to collect [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And I can't remember, do you have a computer at your home?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got a computer, but I don't have anybody to help me, help me use it.
<b>DR:</b> So do you know - 
<b>PT:</b> If I get, get somebody I'd have to pay them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Do you know how to like play games on it?
<b>PT:</b> I guess you just dial up games and you can - 
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever done that before?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> A little bit.
<b>PT:</b> A little bit, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And are you connected to the internet?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know how to use the internet?
<b>PT:</b> Somewhat.
<b>DR:</b> Somewhat, okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] like doing up the weather, you know, 1 thing I've always done, the weather for [INAUDIBLE] so I know what kind of weather to expect when I come up here.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So do you enjoy getting on the computer?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it gives me something to do, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So I was just thinking that, uh, that's another, uh, point of access for you to make connections with other people, other activities, other things.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I, how do I get connected with other people?  I don't know how you really actually do that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean, there are different ways and you have to be a little careful because - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> people aren't always who they say they are.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 'cause I've seen, I've heard people, I've seen stories on the news where 1 guys tries to get a, get connected with, you know, or you know, for - 
<b>DR:</b> For sex or something.
<b>PT:</b> For sex.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Something.  Well, I'll never do that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, there are other ways too.  Do you know about blogs?
<b>PT:</b> Blog, yeah, I've heard blogs, but I don't know how you do it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what it means, somebody can like just start writing about anything and if interests you, you read it and you write back to them and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Find someone that has common interest to kinda write back and forth or just read what they write.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know how, how you go about doing that.  I need someone to show me actually how you do a blog.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I just, there's just nobody I know that could come by and show me to do stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know if any of your counselors know much about computer at all.
<b>PT:</b> Well, they're not really allowed to come inside my place.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, they just stay outside.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I see.  Okay.  Well, um, you know -
<b>PT:</b> I have these geek guys, but they cost a lot.

<b>DR:</b> It says that
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> education
<b>PT:</b> And this is for classes.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, this is education
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] So that's the number I call for classes.  I'll call that 1-800 number and see what they can do.  How far of on Academy?
<b>DR:</b> It's up near Chapel Hills mall, just before you get to the mall.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It's up where, it's in the same shopping center with, uh, um, Pet Smart.
<b>PT:</b> Pet Smart.

<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Beginner classes.  I'll see what they have.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, the other places I've heard that give classes sometimes are the library, sometimes they'll have computer classes.
<b>PT:</b> Library.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes for free or very low cost.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] classes, right. 
<b>DR:</b> But sometimes Tyson Community College, but that's a further distance to go.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Tyson Community. That's [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> There are 2 of them.  One's way down south by [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the bus goes right by there yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, the other 1 up north on Interquest Parkway.
<b>PT:</b> Interquest, yeah.  But I could get to the [INAUDIBLE] 'cause the 25 bus, that's where it turns around.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it goes all the way out there to that - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To the, to the, to the, what's it called, the -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] computers [INAUDIBLE] computer classes [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right, [PATIENT NAME], anything else you can think of that you want to talk about today?
<b>PT:</b> No, not too much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I think you're doing better.
<b>PT:</b> I'm doing better, right.
<b>DR:</b> Every time we meet, you've been doing better and better.
<b>PT:</b> Better and better, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  I think now that, the thing to do is keep looking at what your goals are and find working on ways to achieve them.
<b>PT:</b> Achieve my, look for ways to meet my goals, G O A L S.  Look for ways to meet my goals.
<b>DR:</b> Does that sound good to you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Good.  Let's leave the medicines how they are now if that's okay with you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And then you'll call in, make sure you call in for that other 1.
<b>DR:</b> You bet.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause I just, you know, when I do run out, [INAUDIBLE] don't have it here, doctor didn't call it in.  So as soon as I leave hear, call it in.
<b>DR:</b> I will.  All right.  Should we set up another appointment then?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, do you need to, how soon, like?
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think we could spread it out.  I think you're doing well.
<b>PT:</b> So do you want to go like for 6 months or - 
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's, maybe we should be a little more gradual, instead of going from 1 month to 6 months, maybe we should try like 2 or 3 months this time.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And if you're doing well then, then we could go back to 6 months.  Does that sound okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  So you'd have to check with her and she has to call.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> My other counselor [INAUDIBLE] it would probably be on a Monday, what time on Monday, she doesn't know for sure yet what time so you have to go out and have her call, have her call my other counselor.
<b>DR:</b> Well, would it be easier, um, just to give you a tentative appointment and you can check with your counselor.  If it works, great, if not, you can call me back and we can change it?  Will that work?
<b>PT:</b> I just don't know what time, you know, what, maybe this time I, like at 1:00 could you keep doing Monday at 1:00 sometime like three or four months from now?
<b>DR:</b> I think we could probably do that, find something.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] like at 1:00 on a Monday, but I know she's free on Mondays to bring me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now the other thing that we could do [PATIENT NAME], is think about if we want to do a 45 minute appointment next time or a 20 minute.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I like these 45 ones so that way if we start going, we can keep going or if not, we can end, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Sure and if you're not going to meet with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] as often.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That might work, too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I like these 45 ones.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'd hate to have to stop at 20 minutes, but then if we do find something and we need to keep continuing on for another 10 to 15 minutes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So just, why don't you just give me like 3 months from now at 1:00?
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> If you
<b>DR:</b> That would be Monday, December 17th at 1:00.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> And I'll give you a card with that appointment on it and you can check with your counselor.
<b>PT:</b> And I'll give you a call and let you know if that's good or not.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, what you can do is, we can assume it works, you don't have to call, if it doesn't work, you can call me and we'll set up another time.  How's that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, assume that it does work, if it doesn't work, I'll give you a call.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds perfect.
<b>PT:</b> You need this pen or [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> All right. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> There's the card.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, [PATIENT NAME], and if you need anything before, then you call me okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I'll just assume that this is gonna work and if it doesn't, then I'll give you a call.
<b>DR:</b> That sounds excellent.
<b>PT:</b> Thanks.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Good seeing you.  Glad things are going better.
<b>PT:</b> I think they're going better, too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> And don't forget to call in that.
<b>DR:</b> I'll do that right after you leave.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  You're welcome.  Take it easy.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Bye bye.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
