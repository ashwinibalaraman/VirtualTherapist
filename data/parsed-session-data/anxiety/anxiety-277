<b>THE JOURNEY BACK</b>


As the weeks passed, I started to trust that Dr X really was trying
to help. In the light of my previous delusions, and my
ideas of people around me, this was nothing short of miraculous.
We increased my medication week by week, as I still had
the symptoms, but the delusions bothered me less, as I was
not reading new evidence for them into every situation.


I was always very tired, though, and often had to have afternoon
naps. I found it hard to get up out of bed in the mornings,
and was also experiencing what Stelazine users will
know as the ‘Stelazine stomps’ — a compulsion to jiggle your
legs. This was as annoying to me as it was to other people.


<b>DELUSION FADES</b>


In those couple of months of upping my dose, my waking life
was a lot more controlled, even though I had side effects. For
example, I stopped video-recording TV programs (to collect
evidence), because I no longer had faith in the messages.
Sure, there were coincidences and things I could have read
meaning into, but they didn't manifest in my mind with any
sort of solidity. The voices at night seemed to fade away, and

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had of course told my parents of my taking medication,
Mum casually commented, ‘That's nothing!’ I am sure she
was relieved that we had found some sort of reason for my
behaviour, and that my parents had confidence that it would
not hold me back. They have continued to support me lovingly;
they have and do give me strength. Some people are not
as lucky.
<blockquote>
<p>
Hi everyone. I am worried about my 17-year-old
stepdaughter because her behaviour is odd. Let me
explain. About a year or so ago she became interested
in Eastern religion and now sits Indian-style on the bare
floor for an hour or so at a time. She has also become
vegetarian and refuses to eat the meals I cook. She
states that she won't eat any ‘sentient beings’.
I don't understand her logic at all. Fish isn't meat,
yet she won't eat it either.
She's paranoid about chemical sprayed on fruit and
veggies and will only eat organic.
Also she has some type of obsession with Van Morrison.
Last week she went out and spent her whole paycheck
on his CDs. Shouldn't she be listening to Britney Spears,
Creed and the Backstreet Boys? Do you think she has
some sort of father complex?
I think she has some sort of mental illness and think
she needs therapy.

(The only reply this imbecile got was ‘I think you should just
leave her alone’.)

<b>MORE DRUGS</b>


In the weeks that ensued, I began to talk more openly about
previous experiences such as waking to find entities in my
room, or my theories about time. As I'm now aware of course,
those metaphysical obsessions can be a symptom in themselves.
The psychiatrist told me to double my meds. I nearly
turned around and said religion was delusion en masse, but
didn't. So I began to monitor my own medication as I saw fit,
only liaising with him on any questions I had to do with my illness.
I also began to censor my conversations, and avoided
telling him anything that seemed a little wild metaphysically.
I only told him things that I felt were relevant to the task at
hand.


To combat the stomps, he prescribed another drug called
Cogentin, which is mainly used to treat tremors for people
with Parkinson's disease. This made me even more drowsy
than I already was. At school I would have little naps at my
desk while the other students worked around me — I just
couldn't stay awake. After a few weeks, I decided I could live
with the stomps and stopped the Cogentin treatment.


I later found out that some people who have been on
Stelazine for years often develop a syndrome called tardive
dyskinesia, causing involuntary movements of the mouth,
tongue or face. This also can be treated with Cogentin, with
varied results depending on the severity of the syndrome.

I looked up the meds I am on ... namely Cogentin ...
and found out some horrendous things about it. I am
43 and have been on my current medication for 14 years
plus others such as Largactil, Stelazine and Zyprexa. I
am coming to the end of my tether ... lately I have had
constantly slurred speech and other reactions ... I am

starting to believe that I have Tardive Dyskinesia
(Parkinsonism) ... I said to my hubby the other nite,
well, who is gonna take care of me when I get older
with Parkinsonism, I can only look forward to
premature admission to an old folks home where
they'll just throw away the key &amp; forget about me.
I am really really seriously considering coming off all
drugs, injections or tablets. And the side-effects tablets
aren't much help as far as TD goes, in fact Cogentin can
speed my deterioration. I see my psychiatrist in 10 days.
This illness has got me beat. Best Wishes to all

<b>CHASING MEDICATION</b>


Not long ago, I ran out of medication. I was not concerned;
sometimes I had let a few days go by without me getting
another script. I was enjoying being much more awake, alert,
and actually experiencing laughter of a kind that made my
body rush. I joked with friends, I was having a lot of fun and
asked them with tongue-in-cheek humor to warn me if I start
to go mad in the absence of medication. They didn't worry,
they knew I'd get another prescription before I went down
that path.

<p>
Please don't discontinue your meds at all, especially if
you feel that you are a danger to others. This is so very,
very, important. If you feel you have lost something,
maybe you could try to see things from a more positive
perspective such as this: inside, you feel as though you
had a special connection to something out there that
</p><p>[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
others don't understand, as if you had an insight.
Regardless of whether what you thought was real was
real, the feeling is indisputable. Perhaps you feel
depressed at the thought that this was a fantasy. Well
how about the idea that if in fact there really is more
than meets the eye in this world, then it's worth taking
the time to really appreciate things like the true beauty
of a flower that grows towards the sun, or the way you
feel so good when you laugh at something really funny
or the smell of freshly cut grass and how good the body
feels when it's exhausted but fulfilled after swimming
and alive and buzzing after a run ... Most people who
are ‘normal’don't even appreciate these simple, simple
things, as they are so caught up in work/money/
solutions to problems/materialism/how they are
perceived/pollution/what's going to happen next ...
the very same stressful things that make
schizophrenics feel particularly stressed. Ultimately,
we are all the same, though perhaps under different
circumstances. You might find that taking the time to
find the extraordinary beauty (goodness and positive
energy), the surrealism and an appreciation in the most
oddly mundane things, quite satisfying. Natural
magical phenomenon that it's so much easier to
take for granted than to ever even notice.

As for my friends and workmates they don't know that
there is a anything wrong, as they can't see it. The one
good thing about schiz is that you can't tell who has it.
My parents tell me how can I be ill when I look so
normal. My answer to that is how is a person with
mental illness supposed to look, after all I am still
human and thank god I don't look sick because it makes
it easier to be inconspicuous. The advantage of that is it
makes it easier to overcome the fear of what's going on
inside because I know people can't see I am able to deal
with them and it gets easier and easier. This illness is
a battle and anyone with it is a fighter with the
potential of recovery. The problem is we are our own
worst enemies. You have got to stand up to your fears
to overcome them.


The GP wanted me to get a referral from the psychiatrist
that put me on medication in the first place. I had not seen
him for nearly five years. She seemed to be trying to make
things as difficult as possible. She did, however, give me a
sample pack of the drug, enough for three nights.


A week later, after numerous phone calls and faxes, I made
another appointment with my GP, feeling symptomatic and
disordered through lack of meds. I got a script, went immediately
to the chemist and took a double dose. An hour later, the
lethargy hit: it was a familiar feeling, totally unenjoyable, yet I
knew I must start to endure it again or face the consequences.


The medications rob you of feeling, of joy, and taking them
is like ascending the gallows. Accepting that I am better
off with them rushing around my bloodstream, I joke with

<b>RENEWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH DOCTOR X</b>


I went to Dr X again. I had not seen him in nearly five years. I
had twenty minutes to go through that five years, symptoms,
new medications, everything. I wanted to know how I might
go about treating residual symptoms, and I wanted to try a
new med, as the old one had added 12 kilograms to my weight
over the time I had been on it. He suggested Saraquel, and
threw me a starter pack, enough for four days. He said to
make an appointment in two weeks time to monitor the dose
and check that it was working.


‘Anything else?’ he asked, wrapping up the conversation.


I asked if there was enough medication to last the two
weeks. He threw me another box from across the room.


I got home and calculated there would be enough medication
to last me eight days. I called immediately and explained
this to the secretary; she said he would call me back. He didn't.
If the phone did ring I would have felt like saying, ‘Oh, Dr X,
sorry I was making a mistake — I thought you were someone
who gave a shit.’


Nowadays I am relatively well on one of the newer psychotics,
Zyprexa, or chemical name Olanzapine — which in
turn has its own side effects.


Do we all know what Zyprexa stands for? Let me repeat
myself in case anyone missed it the first time around:



[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048390-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Have you seen the Zyprexa logo? Inside every thin
person is a fat person waiting to evolve with the help of
Zyprexa!


We who have a mental illness seem to be very attached
to those nasty little white pills that are used to make
sure we don't slip into the dark abyss of psychosis. I've
heard some describe it as a wonderland but for me it
definitely wasn't wonderful. Those little tablets
sometimes have side effects which make our legs
shake, our eyes go up, or our bellies to be stretched like
Santa Claus. When we start a new drug we seem to
have a special longterm relationship with our pillows.
I remember when I first started Olanzapine, 4 years ago.
I would get up for lunch, then back to bed. Dinner and a
bit of TV then back to bed. Avery dull and frustrating
experience to say the least.


Maybe someday there will be a cure for illnesses such
as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Believe me
I would be the first one to sign up if I could. Until then
we will keep psychiatrists employed, drug companies
making a mint, organisations having their meetings
and politicians slashing our budgets. It seems to me
quite funny that a little white pill can be the start of
such a ruckus.

<b>CHOICE</b>


I believe there is some choice in regard to medication. If you
are happy and symptomatic, then why not continue that way.
In my case, however, I weighed up the pros of medication as
opposed to the cons, and decided that I was happier and more
functional with medication. One friend of mine stated that he
would rather be dead than to be forced to have monthly injections
and weigh thirty kilos more than he had previously. He
said his body felt like a rotting vegetable. Nowadays he is free
and symptomatic.


I think that when a person has battled an illness for a long
period of time, and when medication is added to the mix, they
can lose sight of who they were for so many years, the ideas
and feelings that identified who they are. It is a shame that
people who identify with their illness as a part of themselves
cannot afford the luxury of leaving it behind, it's just too damaging
to their self-image (something that everyone, especially
the mentally ill, fights hard for).


I am very lucky in that I was responsive to medication, and
the benefits outweigh the side effects.


When I was first diagnosed, the impact of what
‘schizophrenia’ meant finally hit me. I wrote a poem to
express what I was thinking and feeling. I was horrified,
and yet relieved. In the poem I expressed wonder at
what would become of me in the years to come. Would
I get my sanity back, or was I destined to live a life in
and out of the local psychiatric hospital? Would my
children remember me fondly as a good mother, or
would they have memories of visiting me in the psych
ward? Would my husband ever get back the wife he
married, or would our relationship evolve into a new

I'm afraid how my parents will react. My mum will
probably tell me to snap out of it and that ‘It's just a
phase’, because she doesn't understand that illnesses
can happen to anybody. My dad will go dramatic and
then say you can't do this or you can't do that because
people are influencing you to act like this. My mum
thinks I'm Satanised. How horrible is that? She thinks I
have started some weird worship, because he says that
I don't talk to anyone and I talk to myself. I can't help it
and I can't live with it! My friends don't understand
and think I'm emotionally strange or crazy. It's not only
destroying my dignity but also my life. I don't know
what to do. Please, please help.


<b>REALITY IS BORING</b>


A few months after I began medication many of my symptoms
had disappeared. I no longer chased cars to look at numberplates,
or tuned into the radio for messages. I began to
enjoy radio again. The drawback was that life was less interesting.
Instead of feeling that I was always at the centre of
something, albeit unpleasant, I found reality enveloped me in
greyness and boredom.
<blockquote>
<p>
During the past 10 years I made the terrible mistake
(twice) of thinking I was well and stopped taking my
medication. I got sick again and was hospitalised. I
didn't want to think that I had schizophrenia.

I have to confess that I am not over the shame I feel.
It's not something I can talk to people about so I feel
I have a dirty little secret. It affects my relationships
with women as I can't tell them of the shame I feel.
I probably seem weak but I really want to be accepted
by people for what I am (which includes having
schizophrenia).

My doctor said I was lucky in that I responded to treatment
very well, and that it took some people a lot longer to respond,
while some unfortunate individuals did not respond at all.


My life has become hell. I was diagnosed with
schizophrenia earlier this year but have been in and out
of hospitals for a few years. My doctor and I have a
really good relationship, but he can't help me and
admits that he doesn't know what to do.
I am allergic to all the anti-psychotics I have ever been
prescribed and now there are none left. I have no hope
left. I hate myself, I don't understand what's happening
to me and why it's happening to me. I was once
intelligent and full of life but have been reduced to live
a life that's not worth living. I can't stand it. I don't feel
safe on my own but when around others I freak out.

<b>I'M FINE, I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT</b>


Six months later, life was generally stable and happy and one
night, I just decided that I was well and didn't need it. I was
just about symptom-free and had never felt better.


Only later did I realise that this was a common thing for
people with mental illness. Once they are stabilised with medication,
they decide against taking it, and relapse. It wasn't
long before I was listening to the voices once more.


Nowadays I accept that the taking of medications is necessary
for my well-being, and gladly take them.
