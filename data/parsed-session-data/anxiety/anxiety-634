I wish I could tell you that it was great being sober. Okay, it's great
being sober—but it sucks being addicted, even in sobriety, to what
feels like everything that could fuck me up and not much that could
bring me peace. The truth is, when I stopped drinking, I still had no
clue how to live, or even who I was. From so early on in my adult
life I had the need to be accepted and become someone with a
"voice" that was appreciated, and couldn't stand being disliked for
any reason. As glorious as the struggle to make it in the arts was, and
as exciting a life as I've lived, eventually the thrill of hiding from my
feelings behind the progressive need to drink away my fears and
hide from my successes left me a sober man with a lot of new living
to do. I hardly recognized myself when I saw my reflection in the
mirror. And why should I know who the fuck I am? If you live most
of your life feeling that you are mostly wrong, then take on a profession
where you have to please everyone, including some of the most
shameless and vulgar people you can imagine, then once you stop
your self-destruction of choice, you are left with an outline of a
being that seems to resemble you, but your insides are pretty empty.
I have been in the process of getting back to the Richard Lewis I am.
Not the celebrity, not the people-pleaser, not the occasional out-of-control
drunk, not the functioning alcoholic, not the, not the, not
the, not the—not the zillion things that I have become and still have
a need to be even sober; I have to change and learn a new way of
living in my skin and let life take care of the rest.

It's a bitch, believe me. I take my fucking hat off to anyone who
has been ruled by addictions, any one of the endless variety, and has
been close to being destroyed by them, in the process hurting many
loved ones and wiping out lots of chances to have a decent shot at
life, and then starts out again, a recovering hitchhiker on a new road
without road signs, without much to say to any benevolent driver
who picks him up and asks, "So, who are you?"


Who am I? I'm not sure. I get feedback from friends, enemies,
read reviews of how I am professionally, get some awards, some
nominations for this or that, but for the first time I really have a
chance to define myself in a way that isn't blocked by booze or the
need to put on airs. I figure I can just be myself now and see what
happens. I'm not married but I'm sort of looking at life now with
that same vow, "For better or for worse."


I think I work a good program for myself in my recovery: stay
sober, have a nice support group, and do whatever it takes to accept
people for who they are, be loving to those in my life who love me
for the right reasons, try to keep my self-loathing to a workable level
so I can still feel funny and be able to perform, and pray a lot. I pray
that I never forget where I came from, and that regardless of how
fucked up things can get I can know that it'll pass, just like the good
shit will pass and that I can keep the zillion other addictions that are
potentially as powerful and destructive as alcohol locked away in a
cage where they belong, so I don't fall prey once again to something
else that controls me or makes my life spin out of control.


It's amazing how many addictions come out of the woodwork as
soon as you think you have your big one under control. "Do not pass
go—go directly to the addict." They are waiting patiently. It's quite a
rude awakening when you sober up and realize just how enticing it
is to do any number of other things that will take your mind off of
positive behavior, and begin again the same sort of love affair with
fear and self-centeredness. Addiction will go out of its way to come
through for you whenever you're not sure you want to live life in a
happier and healthier fashion.


Trying to calm down for the first time in my life really is stressful.

Trying to eat properly is a new experience. Trying not to fuck around
on a girlfriend seems like a pipe dream considering that it represents
trusting someone very strange... Me. Those are just the appetizers,
man. Getting out of depression is a frightfully difficult trip. Ongoing
fears of career doldrums and financial insecurity always tuck me in
at night. Waking up with free-floating anxiety that can oftentimes
leave me wanting to stay under the covers until I stop breathing isn't
exactly a holiday. And the thing is, I've had these feelings for quite
some time, but when I was drinking I had an easy way to nip them
in the bud and forget about them until I'd wake up, sometimes in
the same clothes with a headache that pounded a gavel of guilt,
pain, shame, and avoidance.


Not anymore! I feel strong. I'm in the ring and am taking all comers.
I sort of feel fearless. You can't lose after you lick a disease. Lick a
disease. How fortunate to be able to actually kick the shit out of the
disease that was kicking the shit out of you. I never have to drink
again. Wow, how cool is that?! The downside is that I have to stand up
to all the new vices and addictions that have waited their turn. I'm up
for the struggle. I've been down for the count for the last time. Every
time my life gets fucked by some event or person, I swear to God, as
long as I handle the situation without drinking myself through it, it
always, and I mean always, works out better than it would have had I
tried to deal with it unconsciously. That might sound very obvious to
the nonaddict but, believe me, a zillion things have happened to me
that I used to experience before sobering up and not one of them hasn't
had a better outcome. That's really proof enough for me.


I have had friends think they could go back out there and do
more research in the world of alcohol and drug abuse and give it a
second or third or fifteenth shot, and many have tombstones to
show for their effort. Others may still be living, but are either in
prison, insane, or hurting more people than they ever imagined possible
once upon a time. So, yeah, I have a ton of cravings waiting to
control me, and it's not easy, but when all is said and done I'd rather
down a quart of ice cream, or irresponsibly neck with a woman who
isn't my girlfriend, and then try to cope with just how badly I feel

I'll drink to that. Maybe I'll head down to the health food bar and
toast with their frozen lettuce, carrot, cranberry, prune, super-duper
protein shake. I can't wait to puke my guts out and be a better person.


I'm not kidding though. I'd rather get sick from that shit than two
bottles of champagne. At least I drive home and have a better chance
of not killing anybody.


When these zillions of yearnings that seem poised to take over
my life strike me, I have a new game plan and it seems to be a cool
plan. I heard someone talk about this once and I tried it out and my
life has improved a great deal. It hasn't always worked but it certainly
has helped. Say I have this overwhelming desire to drown my
sorrows and self-pity with an entire chocolate cake. I visualize the
drive to the store, buying it, getting home and eating it or chewing it
and spitting it out or whatever. I think about how I'll feel afterwards.
I think about how it won't change a fuckin' thing that was getting
me depressed or fearful in the first place, and how badly I'll feel for
having done it, which will make me want to do even more damage
to my system. By the time I work through this scenario, and actually
see myself gorging on this dessert for twelve people, more times
than not I don't act on it and feel fantastic afterwards. Sure, I'm
stuck with what life dealt me—the incredibly strong urge to find
ways not to deal with something difficult—but I do now deal with it
faster and with much more self-respect and with fewer calories.


I sound so healthy. You should only be aware that if the truth be
known, right at this moment, I could eat about a thousand spareribs.


Buddy, can you spare an egg roll?
