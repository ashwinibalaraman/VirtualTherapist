<i>I</i> have my ups and downs on B-1. During one
of my better periods, I'm transferred to C-1, an open ward
where patients are allowed to go out on the hospital
grounds unsupervised. With only one nurse in charge of
the open ward, I feel lots of pressure to be in control of my
behavior if I want to stay there. It's on the open ward that
I begin a significant change for the worse--I regress to
become Pat, the five-year-old I was before being adopted
by Ma and Pa.


I don't like being Pat. She's only a little five-year-old,
can't get around so well and is so easily frightened. But I've
become Pat--spinning out of control, I've ended up in her
little body. I walk slowly, painfully slowly, and totally
terrified into Dr. Baylor's office. I'm just a little girl.
Who's going to take care of me?


"Marie ... Marie ... are you all right?" Dr. Baylor is so
worried about me--I've never seen her face look so worried.
She's just read the note I wrote on her pad: "I'm not
Marie, I'm Pat."


Now Dr. Baylor looks at me intently and begins asking
a series of simple questions I find too difficult to answer.

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Marie, I'm taking you back to B-1. It'll be better for
you there."


I don't resist. Whatever Dr. Baylor says is all right with
me. I don't have enough strength to argue with anyone. As
she takes me back to B-1, I'm a little girl being led home.


But it isn't that I'm just Pat. I'm both Pat and the person
who knows that being Pat is itself a sign of my sickness. I
never totally lose sight of that difference, though the degree
to which I'm aware I've regressed varies, and there are
times when I don't know a life outside of Pat's child world.


Dr. Baylor feels the closed ward environment of B-1 is
necessary given my regression into childhood. She also
puts me back on a medication program. And to emphasize
the seriousness of my condition, she assigns me the first
bed next to the nurses' station so that I can be closely
observed. As I lie there, I feel myself going further back
into time--I become an infant. I roll to my side with my
body curled up into a ball and pull my head down toward
my stomach. Then, I start to whine. The sound of my
voice frightens me. It's the wail of a new-born infant. I
stick my thumb into my mouth and begin rocking my
body back and forth, finding the motion soothing.


"Who's going to stop that awful whining?" one of the
nurses complains. "This ain't no nursery!"


Though I appear unaware of my surroundings, I hear
her words. They're cruel and hurt me deeply. My anger
rises. I know the state I'm in, but I also know that I didn't
bring it on myself and I can't get out of it. I'm glad when
the evening nurse comes on duty. I've come to trust her
and feel safer with her around. She orders some medication
for me and for a little while I'm calmer.


I remain on the bed until the medication has worn off
and then get up to go into the sunporch. I walk over to a

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whenever I become Pat, I get very scared. Also, when
I'm Pat, my head doesn't feel right. A tight band seems to
be strapped around my skull, giving me dull headaches and
a whoozy feeling whenever I walk. Though my experiences
of being the five-year-old Pat subside, my illness
begins taking other, even more frightening forms. And
though some awareness of my general situation as a patient
in the hospital keeps reappearing, I continue to suffer delusions
and hallucinations. I'm no longer in control of my life
but, rather, controlled by forces beyond my real world.


The nights are full of terror for the ward is no longer a
place where I can sleep undisturbed. The darkness is shattered
by the night dimmers which cast shadows that move
across the entire room, covering the walls and the ceiling.
I'm lying in a misty swamp overgrown with eerie weeping
willows. Screaming for help, I run the full length of the
ward with monsters in pursuit. The faces of the nurses are
no longer kind and motherly. They become grotesque
masks painted in rosy piercing colors. The nurses become
devils who have invaded the earth. I'm in Hell. Only
thirty-two and already in Hell.


Often I'm petrified. I just think I'm going to die. There
are these beds in the ward, all in a row, and as I look at

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm paralyzed with conflict--I'm tired, so tired, and I
want to rest, but I can't go near my bed. I go up to the nurse,
to plead for help, but I can hardly utter a word, as I'm retreating
more and more into silence with my deepening
illness.


"That bed ... that bed is for dead people." The words
barely leave my mouth, and I'm sure the nurse doesn't hear
them. She doesn't acknowledge my desperate reach for
survival.


"What are you standing there for?" she shouts, her voice
almost knocking me over. "Go back to bed. Go back to
your bed."


I try to follow her order, but can't move. I turn to her
and all I can say is, "I'm scared ... the people in those beds
are dead, you know ... I can't go to bed." I'm reduced to
a whimper.


The nurse's response is sharp and unyielding. "Listen,"
she insists, "if you want to be crazy, then you be crazy on
someone else's shift. Don't be crazy on mine. You get into
the bed."


I have no choice. I go over to the bed and slowly lie
down. But all night I keep looking at the beds around me,
wondering if I'm still breathing.


I survive that night, but the fear of dying stays with me
for many nights. And the penetrating knowledge that I'm
now living in Hell becomes inescapable.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several days later Florence comes to visit. She is an
intelligent woman in her mid-thirties. She and I became
friends when we were both downstairs on the open ward.
After I was transferred back to the closed ward of B-1, she
remained on the open ward. Florence is in the hospital
because she killed her two children in order to "save them
from their suffering." She also talks a lot about wanting to
die so that she can go to Heaven. On the open ward, we
would spend hours talking, while sitting in chairs on the
porch or while walking around the hospital. We feed each
other's minds and hearts.


Now I'm lying in my bed, still captured by the newly
formed fear of dying, not moving, hoping death will pass
me by. Suddenly Florence appears over me.


"I've come to visit you, Marie," she says. "I heard you
weren't feeling too well."


Here I am, feeling very sick, thinking I'm not going to
make it, terrified of others as well as myself. And here is
Florence, coming to visit me.


"How are you feeling, Marie?" Florence continues, "I
heard they sent you up to this closed ward. You sure don't
look too good. Is there anything I can do to help?"


My mind races, but clearly. "Gee, Florence, I don't
think so. I'm really feeling okay. Thanks anyways, but I'm
doing all right."


"Are you sure?"


"Yeah, Florence, I feel fine. Nothing's wrong ... I'm a
little depressed but, y'know, that'll be okay."


"Well, if you ever need me, if you ever need my help,
just let me know."


"I'll do that," I assure her, "and thanks, thanks for coming
by."


"I'll come back tomorrow to see you again."

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Aw gee, Florence, I don't like to bother you ..."


From some deep place within my crushing pain and
anxiety, a lightness emerges, allowing me to see the crazy
humor of my situation, and that gives me breathing space.
I never have the heart to tell Florence that her dream of
going to heaven has ended. "Florence," I say to myself,
"you think you're going to die and go to Heaven. I hate to
tell you but you're already dead and you're in Hell. This
here ward is Hell. You've died, Florence, just like the rest
of us here, but you just don't know it." I almost laugh to
myself when I realize Florence can stop worrying about
dying now!


I'm kept in bed for most of the two years I remain in B-1.
The staff believes I'm too sick to move about. I retreat into
my bed, pulling the covers over my head, usually curling up
in a fetal position, barely moving, terrified that any movement
will release some frightening voices or sounds.


Miss Wendall and some of the other friendly nurses try
to keep me in bed because they wish to give me rest and
comfort. But sometimes I feel a burning sensation creep
over my body. It's not painful, but it prevents me from
sleeping. Other times, nurses who are less than friendly use
my bed as a punishment, ordering me to stay there or
ridiculing my general fear of moving. They shame and
scare me into staying put, making me more afraid I can't
move, or will fall or be pursued by monsters if I do.


Though I stay in bed most of the time, periodically I
venture into the ward or to the lounge. At times I want to
go to the lounge because that's where the TV is and also
where the patients go to socialize. The ward just has beds.
But getting to the lounge is torture.


As I approach the lounge, the floor begins to tilt upwards,
the angle becoming more radical as I get closer.

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then, when I begin to get anxious about being in the
lounge, I realize I have to start the terrifying journey back
to my bed. As my anxiety in staying in the chair becomes
unbearable, I set out back through that awful territory,
with the tilting floor testing the depth of my will. At the
other end I emerge to the relative peace of my bed. But
inevitably, in the vicious cycle I'm caught in, I'm compelled
to leave the bed again and run the gauntlet to the
lounge.


Sometimes, when friendly nurses are on duty and I'm
feeling relatively better, the lounge becomes a more attractive
place. Then I journey to the lounge, through the still
fearsome tilting floors, more because I want to see TV or
see people or smoke, rather than because I feel driven from
my bed. Those friendly nurses, and especially Miss Wendall,
encourage me to get out of bed. "You'll feel better,
Marie," they say. "You'll feel stronger if you can walk

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I never really understand why I walk on the balls of my
feet when I try to negotiate the sliding morass of that
lounge floor. All I know is that I usually don't feel the
floors, and walking on the balls of my feet gives me more
leverage and support.


There are other times when I feel driven from my bed
and begin racing down the ward, screaming. The nurses
chase after me, trying to grab me. I want to run through a
window to escape from my fear. Racing down the ward
screaming, I'm struggling to stay alive. If I can just get that
extra bit of energy to run faster and farther, then I won't
die. Running beyond what I believe is possible helps me
run beyond my fear. And sometimes I'm running away
from my bed, which becomes a place where I'm fighting to
stay alive. I scream as loud as I can, noises and sounds, not
words. Only by screaming can I breathe enough to stay
alive--screaming is my desperate last-ditch breathing.


When I have to race down the hall, I'll usually run on the
balls of my feet, with my arms extended stiffly into the air.
Being on the balls of my feet is the only way I can be--
I have no choice. It's the way I've worked it out so I can
remain upright--the only way! And I have no choice about
my arms either. There's a force pulling them up and I can't
resist. Running, running faster and faster, until I'm racing.


"There goes Marie, the Castle's own space cadet. OfFon
another journey down the runway. Up, up, and away ...
the space-shot's off!" The playful teasing of the nurses fills
my ears.


As I race down the hall, I hear their words. "Don't they
realize what's happening to me?" I think. "Don't they realize

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm not angry at their teasing because their attitude is
often friendly and playful. They help lighten the burden I
feel on those runs. I even laugh with them sometimes. I appreciate
then how funny it must seem with me on my toes
running down the ward. But the nurses don't understand
the other side--what I'm feeling <i>inside</i>. They don't know
how miserable I am as a space-cadet, how hard it is to have
the force pull my hands up, how frightened I am that I
might become a space-cadet forever. Why can't they
understand that I've no choice? How could they know that
for me, moving in any way, as a space-cadet or not, is
better than lying in bed and not moving at all? And the
faster I move the better, because I believe that as my body
moves and moves faster, I'm getting away from being slow
and sick--two states which are connected in my mind. The
nurses know none of these things because I don't tell them.
I'm barely talking with anyone about anything.


Time means nothing to me. I don't know how much
time has passed, and weeks pass into months without my
knowledge. I become afraid of everything. Though a particular
terrifying experience might be brief, the fear it generates
invades my whole existence, lingering on. I smell
funeral flowers throughout the ward and as I near the
kitchen, a smell of gas suffocates me. I become one with
the monsters who dominate my world. When I look in the
mirror, I sometimes see only the face of an evil devil-like
creature. I can't comb my hair because it's become like
strands of wire, and my lips are no longer human, but

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Though I rarely acknowledge it, my life depends on the
support I get during these awful two years. The staff wants
someone to be with me as much as possible; they feel I need
that kind of care, even protection. Several times I've tried
to take my life. Once I crashed through a window, hoping
the glass would cut into me and I could bleed to death. Yes
... I need protection.


Some of my friends among the patients come up to my
bed every so often, maybe offer me a cigarette and sit with
me so I can smoke it there. And they stay on a while, just
sitting, keeping me company. I don't really talk much--
sometimes not at all--but they sit there anyway. I know
they're there, and feel really good about their visit, and I
guess that comes through because they keep coming. Part
of me wishes I could talk more with them, but I'm cut off
and isolated, unable to break through a wall that's around
me. Sometimes one of the nurses comes by with a sub,
asking if I want it. I might nod my head, and she leaves
it for me in the nurses' refrigerator, with my name on
it. Later in the night I might go to the refrigerator and eat
part of that sub, though it's always hard to swallow any
kind of food.


During one period, staff puts me and my friend Rose
together in our own sleeping room. Maybe they think
Rose can help me. Well, at times it seems to work. She's
always talking to me and sometimes makes me want to
laugh--if only I could. One day I'm feeling a little better.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rose's right. I like talking with her and I'm glad she understands
the state I'm in. I don't hesitate to tell her about
my frightening feelings because we talk about everything.


"You know, Rose," I respond, feeling freer now to talk
than I have in a long time, "it sometimes gets really bad. I
get into some of the rooms here in the hospital and I can
smell funeral flowers. I can smell them all over the place."


"Is that right?" Rose says, showing real interest. "You
really smell them?"


"Yeah, that's what I smell."


"Y'know what?" she asks, in a little bit of a whisper.
"You know what I smell?"


"No."


"Cow manure."


I can't believe she says that. "Come on, Rose, you gotta
be kidding."


"No," she continues, "I smell cow manure."


"You know, Rose, I know you drink. I mean everybody
knows you're in here for drinking. Do you think the booze
kinda went to your head? Are you trying to put me on?"


"I wouldn't put you on," she affirms. "I really smell that
manure."


"Can you smell it now?"


"Yeah, I can smell it right now!"


"Rose, I can smell the funeral flowers, but what you say
doesn't make sense to me."

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And you know something else, Rose," I add, "I also
feel like there's a wind coming over me sometimes. All at
once this wind blows over me and chills me."


Unexpectedly the window in the room flies open, and a
wind fills the room, shooting out the door.


"There it comes," shouts Rose, as she runs out of the
room, straight for the nurses' desk. I begin to laugh,
though the laughter must break through layers of pained
silence. There is Rose trying to explain to the nurse on duty
how powerful my fantasy has become, how the wind I'm
imagining has nearly blown her over.


"Rose, you go back down to your room or I'll have to
separate you from Marie," the nurse admonishes, an outsider
to the fun that lay within even the most apparently
frightening of experiences.


During the night, in our room, I look at Rose to see if
she's having any trouble with the wind, laughing to myself,
then laughing with her as I say, "I don't know, but
there goes that breeze again."


We actually smell these things--though I can't believe
Rose smells the manure, and she can't believe I smell the
funeral flowers. But we listen to each other's story of what
occupies, captures, even tortures our minds. We listen, and
hear, and that helps each of us. Respecting our differing
hallucinations, we respect each other as people. The symptoms
of our emotional problems are also opportunities for
comradeship and laughter. To the outsider, we're two
"crazy" kids, but we're also two friends teasing each other,
having fun. I smell gas too. I don't tell Rose that.


More usually, each day brings its own horror and I'm
constantly yelling and screaming in fear, struggling to keep
horrors away--but they keep coming. One night, I'm

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Through most of this two year period on B-1, when I'm
at my sickest, beset by fears all around me, I'm on a controversial
drug program. At the recommendation of Dr.
Baylor and Miss Wendall, I'm given massive dosages of
Stellazine, which at the time is a new antipsychotic medication.
The maximum daily dosage recommended is 40 milligrams,
but by the end of the program, I'm receiving
2,500 milligrams a day. Miss Wendall and Dr. Baylor are
trying to help. They've read about an experiment that
suggests massive dosages of Stellazine given to schizophrenics
can get them to regress. Eventually a breaking
point is reached where the drug effects act like a shock, and
the patients are led to insights which will reduce their
psychosis. Since I now have the diagnosis of schizophrenia,
and since my condition seems to be deteriorating, Miss
Wendall and Dr. Baylor institute the massive dosage program
as a last resort, trying desperately to break into my
tortured world and pull me out.


Other staff violently disagree with that drug program
because of what they see--as the program progresses I'm
getting sicker, both psychologically and physically. My
hallucinations and delusions are increasing as my physical
health deteriorates, with severe weight loss and fatigue.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm in a vicious cycle with that drug program. When I
experience something terrifying, they increase my dosage as
a way to counteract that terror. But the dosage itself makes
me more terrified, and that leads to yet another increase.


I'll never forget how these drugs feel--I die from them.
When they give me the medications, I start feeling very,
very weak, and very, very scared ... and then I start
screaming, screaming to try to get some energy so I won't
die. I'm dying and if I don't force myself to scream, that's
the end. I have no breath left, I'm choking, and if I can just
scream, I can breathe ... I won't drown ... I won't go
under. And then I can't even breathe enough to scream,
and I can't breathe at all ... and I die ... struggling, I die.
This happens each time I'm given the drugs. When I come
to, I find myself being restrained by several nurses and
being really sick, throwing up continually. There's a basin
filled with vomit and I know I've been throwing up before
I've come to. I'm not sure whether I'm glad to be alive--I
feel too sick.


Eventually, Miss Wendall and Dr. Baylor can't continue
with the program any longer. They've suffered through

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To this day, I don't know exactly how much of my
sickness during that experimental massive-dosage program,
including all the horrible monsters and distortions,
was drug-induced. But in light of what I've learned
recently from several professional psychiatric evaluations,
I believe that in addition to the illness I was already
suffering from then, the panic disorder, I was also suffering
from a toxic reaction to overmedication or what is called
today "toxic psychosis." The medication made my panic
attacks worse. In addition to being overmedicated, I was
wrongly medicated--my diagnosis of schizophrenia turns
out to be a misdiagnosis. From recent psychiatric consultation
I've learned that my diagnosis should have been
endogenous depression and panic attack.


But even after the massive dosages of Stellazine stop, I
don't get better. I rarely eat and don't put on any weight,
though Miss Wendall leaves instructions with the nursing
staff to be sure I'm fed whenever possible. But some of the
