<font size="4"><b>7: Religious Influences on Parenting</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


This chapter sets out to examine the relationship between religion and parenting
practices. Such an examination is complicated by the diversity of religious beliefs and
practices and the paucity of research material on the topic. The emphasis in this chapter
is on two of the three great deistic religions - Judaism and Islam. 'Christianity' is now
part of the mainstream of Western societies, imbuing their value and legal systems.
Judging by the available material, it seems to exert no <i>particular</i> influence.


It is clear from the material available that there is a great division and perhaps even
opposition between professional and religious views in the treatment of children. The
former emphasizes the primacy of the welfare of the child, and the latter the primacy
of religion and parental authority. These issues have practical implications for practice
of parenting support and research with religious groups.


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


In recent years, it has become commonplace to
acknowledge the importance of religion as a
force in people's lives. In the context of the
Iranian revolution, the fatwa against Salman
Rushdie, the various 'Jihads', and most recently
the 'September 11th' events, this acknowledgement
has also taken on the panicky aura of a
potential 'clash of civilizations' between the liberal,
mainly secular West and the (Islamic) fundamentalist
East. It is a mostly unvoiced irony
that ranged on the 'secular' side in one of the
most religious countries in the world, the United
States of America, in which (Christian) religious
fundamentalism is a major reactionary force.


This is an irony which also reveals how easily
appeals to religious values can be used in the
service of racism and xenophobia. More generally,
however, despite postmodernism, global capitalism
and the rhetoric of multiculturalism, religion
retains a powerful hold in most cultures, including
those of the West. The effects of this can be
seen in many areas, but most significantly in the
discussions on moral and ethical issues which
erupt periodically, and which centre particularly
on family life.


These issues include the regulation of sexuality
and the transmission of moral values, but they
also permeate a range of questions around parenting,
for example the inculcation of beliefs,
modes of discipline, educational priorities and
citizenship. Religion, of various kinds and to
varying degrees, is consequently a major influence
on the lives of many parents, possibly
increasingly so in the light of migration and the
effect this has on polarizing, or at least highlighting,
the alternative lifestyles available in
contemporary society. The rise of fundamentalism

Although the importance of religion might
seem obvious, one of the most striking aspects of
this topic from an academic point of view is the
paucity of literature on the subject, particularly
from a psychological perspective. This is despite
a plethora of materials from religious organizations
giving parenting advice (running to
hundreds of publications); increasing concern
over the wilder shores of religious indoctrination
(including post-September 11th questions about
the socialization of 'terrorists' or 'martyrs'); and,
most academically, a long history of anthropological
interest in the religious activities and
symbolism of non-Western cultures, including
initiation rites.


Clearly, coming to grips with the issues
around religion and parenting is important for a
number of reasons. Socially, the context is one in
which, despite the secularization of Western
society, religion continues to have a significant
influence on major sectors of the population and,
in some respects, is even growing in importance.
For example, fundamentalist renderings of
religion, notably within Christianity (especially
in the USA) and Islam, have received major
boosts from events in the Middle East, patterns
of migration and the activities of the political
Right. It is perhaps these versions of religious
orthodoxy which pose the most radical problems
for conventional Western secular understandings
of normative or standard parenting. In addition,
the advocacy and support of multiculturalism in
professional and political circles makes the
understanding of differences in religious values
and their roots urgently pressing.


Conceptually, the relationship between communal
beliefs and values and child-rearing poses
many questions. Little is known about how these
intersect with the prevalent 'liberal consensus'
among mental health and childcare professionals,
which holds the welfare of the individual
child as paramount. Practically, too, there are
implications in terms of understanding and learning
from the impact of religious belief on what
parents do, the effects on child development and
mental health, and the appropriateness of different
forms of intervention in parenting among
religious families. Finally, there would seem to
be potentially rich pickings for researchers here
in areas similar to those outlined above, most
especially perhaps in tracking the developmental
trajectories for children in religious families.


Why, then, is there such a paucity of academic
literature on the subject? As this chapter shows,
this situation is not an accident, but is rather
symptomatic of a deep divide between some core
values of religious parenting and Western psychological
assumptions. The challenge posed by religious
world views to the liberal position of most
childcare professionals and academics is at times
so unexpectedly and embarrassingly profound,
that many of them do not know what to do with
it. Instead, they have tended to treat religion as a
kind of voluntary or neutral 'add on' to the
important issues determining quality of parenting;
for example, marital harmony or attachment
relationships.


This view of religion might be true for many
Westerners who have only mild religious affiliations.
However, what the new strands of religious
fundamentalism appearing in the West
have revealed is that for those parents for whom
religion is central to their lives, its effect is not
neutral at all; it is the bedrock on which the basic
values and assumptions of the parenting process
are built. In order to explore this argument, it is
helpful to focus on some of the issues surfacing
in Western constructions of religious orthodoxy
using, as illustration, the community with which
the present author is most familiar - an orthodox
Jewish community. The aim is to lay some
groundwork for a consideration of the assumptions
about what parenting is for and how these
assumptions might impact on religious parents.
One objective is to convey the importance of
recognizing the way religious values operate in
Western contexts, both for clinical and research
purposes.


<b>CORE ISSUES</b>


Perhaps two brief clinical examples will be a
useful way in here. The first arose after allegations
of sexual abuse surfaced in an ultraorthodox
Jewish boys' school. The author and a
colleague were asked to see several of the boys
involved to assess their therapeutic needs.
Although we had long been inured to the ambiguities
of sexual abuse work, it still came as a
surprise and a disappointment to encounter
strong hostility in a situation in which we had
been asked to help. The hostility was politely and
respectfully expressed: the fathers brought their
sons to see us because their Rabbi, with whom
we had done substantial amounts of previous

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The parents seemed to believe that we were
not just mistaken in raising the issue of possible
sexual abuse with the children, but that we were
actively doing damage. Talking about 'these
things' would stir up trouble, in terms of the
emotional consequences for the boys. Also, our
investigations would reveal something distasteful
going on in the community, thus bringing it
into disrepute and damaging the advance of
religion. Because of this, it was clear to some
fathers that we had acted improperly in such circumstances:
they believed that the Jewish way
'is to sweep it under the carpet'. It seemed clear
at the time that while some of the fathers were
unusual in the openness of their hostility, their
attitude was very much in line with the general
view of the parents involved: that however good
our credentials might be, even with their Rabbi's
blessing, our attempt to talk about sexual abuse
openly was mistaken and possibly religiously
wrong.


The second example was from an earlier piece
of work with a sophisticated ultra-orthodox
family, where both parents were professionals.
Faced with a highly resistant and at times delinquent
adolescent daughter, they had sought help
on their own initiative, albeit after seeking the
approval of their Rabbi in America. Family work
with them went reasonably well and quite a lot of
tension was eased, but what was most remarkable
was one small interchange that could be
interpreted as a signal not to cross a significant
boundary. In one session, having listened to a
catalogue of criticisms of the daughter's behaviour
(she wanted a radio so that she could listen
to pop music, she wanted her ears pierced, and
she was saying that she might want to go to college),
the author suggested this was a common
adolescent stage in which a child starts to make
bids for independence whilst remaining attached.
The parents exchanged glances and then the
mother said, 'Independence is not a term we use,
it's not something we look for in our children'.


There are a number of features of these examples
that point to some of the core issues in
religion and parenting. Both cases reveal the
clinician being tripped up by the sudden exposure
of a set of assumptions about child-rearing,
community life and religious values, which seem
to come from somewhere else, despite the apparent
cultural similarity between him and the families
concerned. The assumptions suggest that helping
a child overcome a possible trauma is <i>not</i> more
important than preserving the good name of the
community, and that achieving autonomy and
independence is not an appropriate developmental
aim. Two world views are in conflict here:
one derived from a Western focus on the needs
and well-being of the child, which at its most
benevolent might be called a 'humanistic' view;
the other relating to the priority given to the collective,
the community, and through that to a
very specific view of 'the proper path of life'. In
this view, a child who is deviant or who disobeys
his father is a cancer in the body politic, to use
the conventional image, and it is a religious duty
to 'wipe him out'. The quotations are from the
commentary to Denteronomy 21, 18-21 by the
most important Jewish commentator on the Bible,
the eleventh century French rabbi, Rashi.


While this position is not actually held to in
contemporary religions, it does symbolize a real
clash of sympathies in relation to parenting priorities.
Religion often aims to <i>enforce</i> the 'proper
path' (witness, for example, the violence of the
so-called 'right to life' movement) and if this
means brushing aside individual sensitivity, then
so be it. Given a secular social context for parenting
in which the happiness and, specifically, the
'welfare of the child' is of paramount legal and
pedagogic concern, this makes for interesting and
often uncomfortable dilemmas.


The paucity of research in this area might also
be due to unvoiced Western assumptions that the
value systems of all cultures should be similar
when it comes to child-rearing. But these assumptions
are spurious and actively misleading, and
themselves represent a mode of 'imperialism' that
is being challenged by religious communities
throughout the West. Liberal academics espouse
critical, rational modes of thought based on evidence
and argument; orthodox religious groups
replace these with 'revelation' and authoritybased
directives. Liberal humanism is based on a
democratic urge, however well or badly that might
have been achieved. Religious orthodoxy is not
democratic. One cannot vote on religious practices.
Obedience to the teachings is demanded as
these have been passed down through religious
authorities who sometimes lay claim to their own
authority on the basis of charisma and learning,
but mostly on the basis of <i>who</i> (what previous
authority) has conferred it upon them. This is particularly
the case with fundamentalist versions of
religion, where the task is the maintenance of
traditional authority structures and beliefs, which
are seen as more important than the welfare of
individuals. In this view, religion is not about anyone's
'best interests' but is about following certain
'laws' which are immutable, because they are

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This should not be taken to mean that all
religious affiliations are the same, or that only fundamentalist
influences demand attention. Indeed,
the common failure to imagine the huge range of
religious positions may be one of the factors contributing
to support for fundamentalist authoritarianism
in religion. Outsiders (e.g. the state through
its funding agencies, the media, and professionals
in health and social services) relate to minority
communities through representatives of religious
orthodoxy rather than, for example, dissenting
groups (Sahgal and Yuval-Davis, 1992). What
actually exists in many religious communities,
what differentiates them from homogeneously
fundamentalist, authoritarian structures, is a
healthy <i>uncertainty</i> about truth, whereby many
community members are connected through primarily
cultural and ethnic affinities rather than
firmly held religious beliefs. Thus, the degree to
which even orthodox religions pursue uniform
child-rearing is enormously varied, from a rigid
authoritarian, father-dominant style at one extreme
to laissez-faire and liberal parents at the other. A
common professional problem is the tendency to
lump together all modes of religion, often seeing
them as the same (mainly exotic) 'cultures' without
recognizing real divergences and conflicts.


In this context, it is difficult to hold on to a
coherent notion of what might be meant by 'religious'
influences on parenting. Nevertheless, it is
important to recognize the degree to which
religion manifests itself not just as the espousal of
certain values, but as the regulation of action - a
position shared by orthodox Judaism through the
detailed legal code of Halachah (rabbinic law) and
Islam through the Shar'ia (law made by Mullahs),
both of which are complex sets of rules for conduct
with little parallel in Western secular law.


Much of this regulatory and prescriptive legislation
relates to parenting: indeed, about a third
of the legal injunctions in the Quran are concerned
with the family and appropriate relations
within it (Ahsan, 1995). Muslim parents traditionally
have had enormous moral and quasilegal
authority over their children, effectively
including the right to manage their affairs and
direct the course of their lives in all its moral,
social and religious detail (Akhtar, 1995). The
guidance parents offer must, however, conflict
neither with the explicit dictates of the Quran nor
with the prophetic exemplar (the normative conduct
of Mohammed). There are also some specific circumstances
in which children may legitimately
rebel against a misuse of parental powers.
Importantly, these are religious circumstances - in
particular, if parents try to bring up their children
to be idolaters (Akhtar, 1995).


This is relevant where a child adopts
fundamentalist practices against the wishes of a
more liberal parent, something which often hap
in the Jewish community and, as is already
evident, will become more common amongst
Western Muslims. Under these circumstances,
finding 'the proper path of life' involves going
against the authority of parents, who, at the
extreme, may even be rejected or denounced.


On a more familiar level, there has been a
pained debate in religious communities about the
extent to which the religious injunction to 'honour
your father and mother' holds when, for
example, parents encourage children to engage in
illegal activities or make them the victim of (particularly
sexual) abuse. While to outsiders it
might be assumed that by such behaviour a
parent relinquishes the claim to moral authority,
not all religious leaders have seen things that way.
In some religions, children are not even supposed
to speak of their parents to outsiders, whether for
good or ill. Several family therapists trying to
work with orthodox Jewish families, for example,
have come up against interpretations of 'speaking
evil' rules which mean that nothing can be said
about parents without their explicit permission
and their presence. Although religious authorities
(e.g. the main London orthodox rabbinical court)
have tended to rule that children whose parents
abuse them should be exempt from the requirement
to show them honour, there are very strong
prohibitions against revolt, and some of the
court's own practices (e.g. their refusal to give
evidential weight to the testimony of children and
women) militate against a more liberal dissent
from parents' views.


Thus, as we have seen, despite the significance
of religion in some minorities, there is a strikingly
weak literature on the topic of religious influences
on parenting. This is partly because of a failure
amongst secular Western professionals and
researchers to appreciate the diversity of religious
life. At its extremes, there is a radical discontinuity
between Western humanist perceptions of the role
of parenting and those held by religious believers.
Specifically, the Western tradition places the welfare
of the individual child at the centre of its concerns
and assumes that this will be true in all
contexts, despite variations in cultural practices.
For religious parents, however, it may be that promoting
the continuity of the community and
upholding the 'truth of the religious path' is more
important than maximizing the freedom, autonomy
and independence of the individual child. Thus,
their approach to parenting is likely to be religion-centred
rather than child-centred.

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This does not mean that they have a free hand,
for example, to discipline children as harshly as
they like, or to abuse them. On the contrary,
often there is a very strong commitment to the
idea of the well-being of children in religious
communities, although abuse and harshness are
not absent. Kate Loewenthal, writing about the
pressures of bringing up a large family, comments,
'The believing Jew (and believers of other
religious traditions) feels that each soul that is
brought into a human body is precious; each has
spiritually significant tasks to accomplish; the
parents are privileged to be the means of
enabling this ... Each child is precious, a spiritual
gem' (Loewenthal and Brooke-Rogers,
2001, p. 9). Nevertheless, the idea that each child
has 'spiritually significant tasks to accomplish'
and that parents are 'the means of enabling this'
is not a common notion directing the work of
Western psychologists and childcare professionals.
Despite some similarities of outlook, childrearing
practices in religious communities are
organized and priorities established by religious
rules of conduct rather than by those apparently
shared in secular cultures.


The more strongly held the religious position,
the more complex all this becomes. The various
tensions here involve the active wish of parents
to transmit something of their own allegiances -
their identities - to their children, measured
against a set of liberal values that emphasize
individual freedom to make some kind of choice.
This choice is always constrained, at least by the
forces in its social context. There is also the additional
and specific problem that fundamentalist
cultures do not recognize the legitimacy of
'choice', let alone of liberal values. Indeed, each
framework is in part built around the repudiation
of the other, through a process of scrutiny, judgement
and ostracism. Liberals refute the authoritarianism
of fundamentalists either as something
'primitive' or as an understandable but pernicious
defensiveness; fundamentalists reject the
secular, pluralistic, fragile morality of the West
which, they argue, so often fails to provide any
sense of 'roots'.


In this debate, there is no evidence to suggest
that the rigid morality of fundamentalist religion
produces children with less robust mental health
outcomes than the liberal framework characteristic
of pluralist Western society. However,
absence of evidence one way or another does not
support either case. Even in areas where the
oppressive nature of the religious outlook seems
obvious, for example, in sexual repressiveness
and the subjugation of women, there are many
speaking from within fundamentalist communities
who claim otherwise. Most people in
the West would agree that a fundamentalist
community's failure to educate a child so that
she or he has the best capacity to make informed
choices between different careers and lifestyles
is a constraint on freedom. However, there are
many religionists who argue that there can be a
similar loss of freedom when religious and communal
values, which are part of a child's family
tradition, are not inculcated in the child. For
example, it has often been pointed out that male
circumcision carried out for religious reasons
contravenes the rights of children to physical
integrity. Similarly, many practices appear to
negate the right of women to equality.
Importantly, these values are accepted as universal
and not culture-bound, and are enshrined in
UN resolutions and charters (Katz, 1999). From
the child protection perspective, therefore, male
circumcision should provoke prevention and
intervention. However, from a religious perspective,
circumcision itself may be seen as a fundamental
injunction; <i>not</i> to circumcise a male child
will therefore be wrong on religious grounds, as
it contravenes the explicit 'command of God'. It
also carries a variety of perceived risks and consequences,
both for the individual child and his
family, who might find themselves excluded
from the community, and for the community
itself, which might experience the repudiation of
a defining feature of its way of life. Rational
arguments about 'right' or 'wrong' are deemed
irrelevant where religious authority is concerned.


Continued negation of the right of women to
equality with their menfolk in Islam and Judaism
(and some fundamentalist Christian sects) is
similarly justified by the (male) religionists as
deriving from authoritative religious 'commandments'.
Despite some dissent by women and
attempts at their 'liberation' by some men, the
practices continue, since they are critical to
maintaining the very fabric of those religions as
they stand.


These examples suggest that there is a fundamental
incommensurability between the professional
discourse of child protection and the
humane discourse of equality of men and women
on the one hand and the religious view on the
other. Thus, the argument between them can only
be resolved on grounds of value rather than fact,
that is, by asserting the superiority of one set of
values over the other, even if this assertion may
be based on fundamental notions of justice and
human worth. Appealing, for example, to mental
health outcomes (even if they could be shown to
be different in the two systems) is not the point:
secularists will not adopt religious beliefs
because this might make their children less likely
to go off the rails; and religious believers will not

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the whole, in the West, it is Western liberal
perspectives that have absorbed much of the
Christian belief systems that dominate the area of
parenting and normative child development,
especially in terms of interventions. In this sense,
expectations of cultural 'sensitivity' derived
from 'multiculturalism' are largely one-way:
from the point of view of the state, it is always
the other who has to change because the state
represents the majority. Even when multiculturalism
leads to the relaxing of Western values in
order to make room for the co-existence of
ethnically and religiously diverse citizens,
Western values are not themselves usually pressured
to change by other cultural positions. They
continue to retain the assumption of superiority,
even if unvoiced. Ilan Katz (1999), contributing
to the debate on child protection, gives the example
of how in many Muslim communities in the
UK, it is viewed as abusive not to send children
to a religious school. Further, the same Muslims
do not regard it as abusive physically to chastise
a child who refuses to go to school. He notes: 'It
is quite likely that physical chastisement will
result in the intervention of child protection
agencies, but very unlikely that a parent not
sending a child to a religious school would be
deemed to be an appropriate trigger for a child
protection enquiry'.


Again we need to remember that the assumption
that all enlightened cultures have the same
developmental aims, for instance to promote
autonomy, independence and individual happiness,
is simply unfounded. Western professionals
and academics are caught up in a long history of
imperialist reasoning when they take their own
culture as the measure by which all others are to
be judged. The purpose of a religious upbringing
is 'to serve God', usually by ensuring that
children carry on the religious tradition, even if
this means severely restricting their lifestyles and
developmental, not to say career, possibilities.
The idea, for example, that a Muslim girl might
be sent away to be married to a Muslim boy she
has never met before seems anathema to Western
consciousness, organized as it is around notions
of individual choice and romantic love. However,
if it preserves the girl's religious (and sexual)
integrity, then it might well be seen from within
the community as justifiable.


Children's individual rights to self-determination
may be respected at the extreme, in the sense
that they can usually choose to cut themselves
off from their community. However, they are not
accepted as a principle because, unlike liberal
humanistic views, the individual human subject
is not the basic unit of the moral order. The community
and, behind it, the religious 'truth'
inscribed in its texts and supported by its authorities,
is more primary, more 'fundamental'. Most
religious cultures allow some specific laws to be
transgressed in order to save life, as they place
strong value on the preciousness and even 'holiness'
of the individual souls with which they
have been entrusted. However, they do not organize
themselves to promote individual development
or happiness, but to maintain order and
tradition, without which religious culture and its
integrity will be lost.


The idea that the community's 'entitlements'
might be more important than those of the individual
child is a considerable challenge to the liberal
view that places the rights of the individual at
the centre of moral systems, and makes the optimal
development of the child's individuality the
goal of parenting. Indeed, in the classic 'rights
versus duties' tension of citizenship, fundamentalists
quite straightforwardly emphasize the primacy
of duties. The 'best interests of the child'
are less significant than the best interests of the
community as judged by those vested with religious
authority, such as the Mullah or the Rabbi.
It can often be argued that these two poles are not
apart but go together - it is in the 'best interests of
the child' to be acceptable to the community -
though not always. When in conflict, preservation
of the community and its traditional religious
values is of paramount concern - passing down
the truth to the next generation. It is important to
note here that while this primacy of the community's
interests occurs particularly strongly in
totalitarian and authoritarian systems (of which
religious fundamentalism is the most vibrant contemporary
example) it cannot be dismissed <i>a
priori</i> as an irrational or pernicious occurrence.
All religious and most other communities have
this concern; the differences lie in the degree to
and methods by which they are willing to subjugate
the interests of individuals. Fundamentalist
leaders might not step back from the demand that
children are sacrificed in the interests of the
social-religious order, as many recent examples
show, and in so doing they reveal their extremism.
But it is not only fundamentalist cultures that
demand such steps, as we see from time to time,
in wars and other events.


<b>PRACTICE OF PARENTING</b>


An important qualification needs to be made
here, in order to ameliorate any sense that

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• monitoring and 'control' of juvenile sexuality
in a permissive culture where sexual experimentation
from adolescence onwards is the
norm;


• ambiguous moral attitudes to boy-girl relationships,
including self-determination of
sexual acts;


• ready access to information about the technology
of contraception - themes that are
part of the biology syllabus of British schools
and must therefore be taught by law - and
also a whole sex education curriculum, using
models and aids such as condoms;


• widespread drug use and abuse by teenagers
to which their children may be exposed;


• some kinds of contemporary music which
might encourage dissenting beliefs and attitudes
such as, for example, the acceptability
of sexual experimentation and defiance of
parental authority;


• lapses in strict religious observance, especially
for those who leave home to go to
university and live independently in a secular
environment for a prolonged period.


Young people, on the other hand, themselves
might see their religious heritage as one amongst
many possible paths which they could take, or as
something to be held on to only to the degree that
it does not constrain their other choices
adversely. Given their immersion in a modern
society, to which they are exposed whatever the
constraints of home and community environments,
young people in religiously orthodox
cultures have to grapple with choices that simply
might not have been available to their elders.
Evidence suggests that, particularly amongst
Muslim children, the impact of religious values
is to strengthen notions of 'proper conduct' and
family and community ties. This does not usually
mean that children adopt all religious injunctions,
but their religious beliefs place limits on
their behaviour and give greater cohesion to their
lives, to the extent that they observe religious
injunctions. So, for example, some Muslim boys
will go out with non-Muslim girls but would not
consider marrying them (Frosh et al, 2002).


Alternatively, the entwining of religion and
notions of correct conduct may provoke more
conflict, as in the many examples of difficulties
surrounding arranged marriages. A common
response of religious parents under such circumstances
is to become coercive in ways that are
clearly counter-productive, not just from the
point of view of a Western child-centred discourse,
but in its own terms. For example, it is
claimed (Akhtar, 1995) that Muslim adolescents
in Britain are often coerced into marriage or
engagement in order to legalize and control their
sexuality, before the freedom of the surrounding
culture gets to work. However, this can result in
the disintegration of the extended family, with
children who refuse to accept parental choices
and increasingly make their own decisions about
marriage partner, place of residence and lifestyle.
There may even be a 'disintegration of faithbased
identity', particularly amongst girls, under
the impulse of parental pressure towards academic
achievement and acceptance of unfairly
arranged marriages.


The word 'unfairly' is important here from a
religious perspective, suggesting not only that
coercive arranged marriages can lead to disintegration
of family and faith, but also that they are
religiously <i>wrong</i>. In the case of arranged marriages,
the Quran makes it clear that they must be
fair and appropriate, which means that parents do
not have complete control over their children's
destinies. An important point here, from a professional
point of view, is that only a religious
authority would be able to rule on whether a
parent was behaving unfairly, an issue that often
arises in clinical work when trying to establish
the boundaries of appropriate parenting.


The factors described above have considerable
practical importance in areas central to parental
activities and boundaries of decision-making,
for instance in education, child protection and

There is some evidence that religious parents
are more likely to have harmonious family relationships
rather than the converse, and less likely
to use physical punishment against their children.
This is contrary to what might have been predicted
from some of the earlier comments and
from suggestions that religious parents are likely
to be more punitive and engage in harsher discipline
than do secular parents (Loewenthal, 2001).
For example, in a study of African-American
families in the rural south of the USA, Brody
et al. (1998) found higher religious activity
among the parents to be associated with lower
levels of conflict between them, more cohesive
family relationships and fewer problems among
their adolescent children.


Reviewing the literature on the relationship of
fathering and religious belief, Dollahite (1998)
argues that religion generally has a positive
influence on men and supports 'responsible'
fathering, specifically through moral persuasion,
personal example, community support and
explicit teaching of marriage and family life. The
research he quotes suggests that American men
know that a sense of 'meaning', direction, solace,
and involvement with a caring community and
religious practices in which these are embedded
are important in raising children. For these
parents, 'religion, consisting of a covenant faith
community with teachings and narratives that
enhance spirituality and encourage morality, is
the most powerful, meaningful, and sustained
influence for encouraging men to be fully involved
in children's lives' (Dollahite, 1998, p. 3).


There is also research evidence suggesting that
religious attitudes, and perhaps the structures of
communal support that often accompany them,
are helpful in the parenting of children with
specific difficulties and disabilities. For example,
some evidence comes from interviews with
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
('Mormon') fathers of children with special
needs (Marks and Dollahite, 2001). The focus of
enquiry was the meaning of religion in relation to
responsible, involved parenting for these fathers
and their families. Interviews showed that
although the fathers' experiences with religion
were sometimes challenging, religion was meaningful
and influential in supporting them in their
efforts to be responsible and focused on relations.
Religion was an important resource for
these fathers, affecting how they coped, the perspective
they took, the way they experienced
their parenting, and how they created their life
stories (Dollahite et al., 1998). Research has also
been done with parents of Mexican and Puerto
Rican origin living in the USA who had young
children with developmental delays, to determine
the role of religion in their lives. These
results indicated that parents largely viewed
themselves as religious, were affiliated with a
formal religion and participated in religious
activities. Most parents viewed both church and
faith as supportive, but faith was shown to provide
more support, suggesting that the important
factor for them was not simply connection with a
community (Skinner et al., 2001).


Enquiries into the culture of American 'conservative
Protestantism' show that religious
values are an important predictor of child-rearing
attitudes and practices in a number of ways
(Wilcox, 1997). Specifically, while conservative
Protestant parents maintain strict discipline, they
also show an unusually warm and expressive
style of parent-child interaction. This is further
supported by the parenting advice given to them
by religious leaders. In addition, data from the
1987-1988 US National Survey of Families and
Households shows that parents with conservative
theological beliefs are more likely to praise and
hug their children than are parents with less
conservative views (ibid.). Effect of parental
religiosity and racial identity on their reports of
child behaviour problems in a sample of lowincome
African-American children has also been
studied (Christian and Barbarin, 2001). Results
from interviews and questionnaires administered
in the early 1990s showed that children of parents
attending church at least weekly had fewer

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A further study of young people from a very
religious and homogeneous community,
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay
Saints attending Brigham Young University,
also shows a protective effect of parental religiosity
on mental health, this time in regard to
drug use, which had a very low (self-reported)
incidence (Merrill et al., 2001). The most commonly
reported reasons for abstention from
drugs were that drug use would violate the young
person's religious beliefs and personal moral
code. Protective factors against drug use
included parental positions of responsibility in
the church and frequent family discussions
involving religion and Christian conduct. Mothers'
views of religion were a stronger inhibitor of previous
drug use than fathers' views, positions of
church responsibility held by the parents, or
arguments about religious teachings with parents.
Discussion on topics of Christian conduct
was more strongly associated with no previous
drug use than were either church attendance or
discussions on topics of religious doctrine. Taken
together, these findings suggest that cohesive
family life combined with religious belief, and a
context in which religiously informed behaviour
could be discussed, are of preventive value in the
high-risk area of drug taking and probably associated
behaviours. Interestingly, despite overt
paternal dominance, it is the maternal communication
and presumably relationship that is the
more powerful buffer against adverse influences.


These are all admittedly limited data, but they
suggest that the structure of religion, both in
terms of its inculcation of beliefs and ethics and
its community, can have a beneficial effect on
practice of parenting. However, there are draw-backs
too. For instance, one significant factor is
the large size of many religious families which
results from the prohibition of contraception
(except for strict medical reasons) and the advocacy
of (often youthful) marriage towards a state
of 'spiritual completion'. In some of these communities,
there is an average of five children per
family, with families of ten or more children
being commonplace (Holman and Holman,
2002). In these circumstances, with the added
problem of the economic privation produced by
large families, maternal depression is quite
common. This may be offset to some extent by
community organizations and by the benefits of
living in an environment of close relatives and
contacts. The mental health effects of these difficulties
on children in religious communities have
not been researched. However, given the strength
of the link between maternal depression and
children's problems, difficulties are likely to
be substantial (Loewenthal and Goldblatt,
1993).


In child protection, issues of punishment,
neglect of children's wishes over arranged
marriages and circumcision have already been
mentioned, as has the intractable problem of the
'closed' nature of many religious communities
to outside scrutiny. There have been suggestions
in the literature that religion promotes
child abuse, at least to the extent that it endorses
physical means of punishment. There are
widely varying Christian sources advocating the
use of corporal punishment 'for the good of the
child' which can easily drift into child abuse
(Capps, 1992). There is also evidence in contemporary
Christian writings that physical and
psychological abuse, shaming and humiliating
children is rationalized in the name of principled
child-rearing (De Jonge, 1995). That these
may form the basis for creating a cycle of violence
within families and subcultures seems to
be ignored.


Studies of undergraduates and their parents
show a relationship between fundamentalism and
support for corporal punishment, although associated
right-wing authoritarian attitudes appear
to be at least as important as religious beliefs
(Danso et al., 1997). Conservative Protestants
(and to a lesser extent Catholics) seem to endorse
authoritarian parenting disproportionately (that
is, to value obedience at the expense of autonomy),
linked to three core religious beliefs:
biblical literalism, the belief that human nature is
sinful, and punitive attitudes toward sinners
(Ellison and Sherkat, 1993). However, although
such studies demonstrate that conservative
Protestant parents support corporal punishment
more strongly and use it more frequently than
other parents (Ellison, 1996), it remains unclear
whether this form of religious conservatism
is linked with actual child abuse, unless the term
is extended to imply all physical forms of
discipline.


On the other side, a study of British adults suggests
that there was no relationship between
recalled parental religiosity and the use of physical
punishment with children under 13 years of
age. The more religious parents were less likely
to use physical punishment on adolescents over
13 years. When parents did use physical punishment,
the more religious were less likely to
accompany it with shouting and saying damaging

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, it appears that there is evidence both
'for' and 'against' religiosity in relation to
parenting practices and their consequences. So
religiosity itself does not appear a significant
factor. As elsewhere, parental personalities and
family histories and cultures seem to be the more
influential factors in determining parental behaviour
towards the child.


When child abuse and protection becomes an
issue in religious communities, there can be substantial
difficulties for secular state agencies in
trying to gain access (Shor, 1998). Given that the
good standing and reputation of the community
is linked to promoting religious belief, then anything
that brings shame on the community can be
seen as an anti-religious act. When problems
occur, this can mean that the community turns
silent in order to prevent outsiders knowing of its
troubles. As several high-profile instances in the
Catholic and Jewish communities have shown,
this can act solidly against child protection work,
even when these nominally have the support of
religious authorities.


In the clinical vignette given earlier, the community
can be seen virtually to shut down in the
face of child protection investigations from outside;
in extreme cases, forms of excommunication
have been exerted on those who use the
secular, state system as a port of call for protective
activity. Very commonly, particularly in the
case of sexual abuse where an abuser is known
within the community, religious authorities will
take responsibility for intervening. The consequence
is often that the suspected abuser moves
out of the community, with the risk exported
elsewhere. All this can be extremely frustrating
for child protection authorities, who may find
themselves unable to establish the standing of
accusations or meet the protective and therapeutic
needs of children involved.


In the area of education, there is a substantial
and visible impact of religion on what parents will
tolerate. As noted above, the biology and sex
education of state schools is often problematic for
religious parents. That is why, in the USA, the
largest group of 'home educators' are Christians
wishing to ensure that their children are not
exposed to education on sexuality - as well as
wishing to inculcate in them minority attitudes
such as 'creationism'. Research on fundamentalist
Christian parents in the USA suggests that such
parents significantly boost the educational attainment
of male children who follow their beliefs,
but also that they are deleterious to the educational
attainments of girls, particularly those who eventually
move away from fundamentalist attitudes
themselves (Sherkat and Darnell, 1999). More
generally, most religious parents wish to have
single-sex schooling for their children, at least
once they get to adolescence, which can mean that
they have great trouble finding anything suitable
within the state sector (Ahsan, 1995).


There is also the broader question of what is
taught, how much of the curriculum can be
devoted to religious instruction, and how to
ensure that this is of the 'right kind'. For all these
reasons, schooling in religious communities is
usually private: children go to single-sex schools
where the curriculum is heavily loaded towards
religious instruction and sometimes (though by
no means universally) where secular studies are
relegated to secondary importance. Nevertheless,
religious schools in Britain feature well in
'league tables' for secular outcomes.


There are several further consequences of this
situation, varying somewhat across different religious
groups. For example, in the strictly orthodox
Jewish community, schooling follows a distinctive
pattern: parents wish to give their children a
'Torah education', demanding single-sex schooling
and a very high proportion of time spent in
studying religious texts. Few of the schools meeting
the requirements of strictly orthodox parents
receive state or local authority funding, meaning
that parents have to use private funds, thus adding
to the economic pressure of having to provide for
large families. This in turn may be an important
risk factor for psychiatric morbidity among adults
in this community (Loewenthal and Goldblatt,
1993). It is also probably linked to child mental
health difficulties, although very little is known
about psychiatric morbidity among children in the
strictly orthodox Jewish or Muslim communities
since there is reluctance to admit to problems and
to seek help, especially outside the community.
Fear of stigmatization is a powerful factor driving
the widespread view that she or he 'will grow out
of it'.


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE</b>


Religious values and beliefs have implications
for design of schools and curricula and in

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is important for professionals to support
community-based initiatives, despite difficulties
of confidentiality, because without this there is
likely to be a substantial gap between the needs
of the community and their take-up of provision.
There are many ways in which parents in religious
communities might feel misunderstood by
secular professionals. Whilst 'cultural awareness'
educational programmes are of value here,
they cannot always address the gulf between the
ideological standpoints of religious and secular
cultures. Moreover, simply feeling comfortable
enough to accept help is a major issue when it
comes to parenting and mental health provision,
something which is more likely to occur when
services are provided from within communities
rather than from outside (Loewenthal, 1999).
The most significant move forward, however,
will perhaps be achieved when parenting and
child mental health professionals recognize that
religious beliefs and practices are not best understood
as an optional 'add-on' to the mores of
Western secular culture - something exotic to be
learnt about and acknowledged but not taken
seriously. Rather, they represent, at least at their
extremes, an ideology that in important and relevant
respects is opposed to the one almost
universally adopted by those who operate health
and education services.


In research terms, it will also be apparent from
the paucity of empirical data in this chapter that
very little is known about the extent of actual
variations in parenting behaviour between
members of different religious and secular
groups. In addition, the degree of heterogeneity
that exists amongst parents who are members of
religious communities is worthy of research, as it
will allow some calibration of 'normality' in
those communities as well as increased understanding
of the degree to which variations from
apparently accepted or prescribed practices are
themselves normative. The degree of conflict
represented by this heterogeneity, whether it
varies across cultures, and how much it is changing
over time, are all relevant concerns.


There is also a real opportunity to examine the
relative mental health outcomes of radically different
sets of parenting values, particularly in
relation to fundamentalism. So little is known
about the frequencies of parenting difficulties
and mental health problems in children in
religious communities, that it is not even possible
at this stage to say with confidence whether current
services are meeting the needs of such communities
appropriately. Some basic research is
required, but in order to do it researchers will
have to work industriously to cultivate good relationships
with community organizations and religious
authorities - and this takes imagination,
diplomacy and commitment.
