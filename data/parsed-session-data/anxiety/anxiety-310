RESTORED to a reasonable semblance of health by
the ministrations of the kindly Miss Hickey and
her staff, I found myself back once again as a Liaison
Officer at the Ministry of Health (South West Region)
and living in my rooms at 2 South Dene. Here, during
these stirring times, I spent the following two years in
this quiet job, living a quiet life in a suburban side road
in what is perhaps the quietest of our large provincial
cities—for, once the blitzes were over by the summer of
1941, Bristol would seem to have set itself to rival
Clungunbury and Clun as the quietest place under the
sun.


Doubtless to compensate for its lack of facilities for self-expression
in other respects, Bristol possesses an abundance
of pillar boxes—it is as if the inhabitants of this
subdued city find an outlet for their feelings in writing
letters to the outer and more eventful world. Certainly
during my own time in Bristol I made good use of these
postal facilities for, like many another transplanted from
our natural surroundings by force of war-time circumstances,
I lived through my correspondence. And as I
now look at the letters and copies of letters belonging to
that era, which I have kept, I find our sitting room looking
like a solicitor's office with no less than thirty large-size
rolls of correspondence lying about.


An interesting correspondence! For in it I can claim
to have rescued from oblivion an entire phase of our

[p. <i>209</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, let us inspect my rolls of letters wherein lies
embalmed a slice of my life. What more natural than that
the largest bundle should bear the signal R. Acland—
that most prolific correspondent not only of that time,
but one might almost hazard of all time. (I would hesitate
to guess how many rooms Richard Acland's correspondence
fills, should he keep this.) Then here are others
labelled with names in the public eye both at that time
and since, such as Philip Fothergill, Tom Wintringham,
Clem Davies: and yet others with names that
have not come to break through to be known to the world
at large.


At the head of this chapter I have inserted one out of
the most slender collection. For it was this particular
letter from George Grey that set me on the fresh course
which my life now took.


This correspondence of mine had a dual origin. Part
from the circular letter which I had addressed to Liberal
candidates and others prior to my interview with Sir
Archibald Sinclair. Part from my book which had reached
publication date on March 14th, 1941. "The advance
sales are nothing to comment on. We must hope that the
early readers develop the necessary enthusiasm to widen
and deepen public interest." wrote Jonathan Cape in
consoling fashion at the time. But public interest had
remained, like advance sales, also nothing to comment on:
and amongst its early readers the following were typical
reactions. From H. G. Wells: "I should call myself

[p. <i>210</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, though I had not been a best-seller, I had—
by virtue of numerous copies distributed free—kept on
the boil my extensive correspondence throughout the
Liberal Party. For much of what I said, both in my
book and in my letter, found an echo in the minds of
those to whom I sent it.


Amongst these was George Grey. Tall, handsome,
dignified in bearing, it was not easy to remind oneself
that George Grey was still in his early twenties. He had
the equipment of intellect and character that he had
inherited from the distinguished family to which he
belonged; combined with the maturity of manner and
personal assurance at an early age which appears to be
the prerogative of a Winchester education. It was the first
time I had encountered it and I was doubly impressed.


George Grey, writing to me in reply to my book, had
summed up the situation in well-measured terms. His
solution against the dangers that threatened us in the
post-war world was to "increase the Liberal representation
in the House of Commons." In this we had seen
eye to eye and I had replied accordingly. And now
at this vital juncture of my life, was this further
letter.


I read George Grey's letter as a summons. When the
18th July came, though still far from well, I was at the
Liberal Assembly in London.

[p. <i>211</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Though the electoral truce had now fettered the
Party with its bonds for almost two years, the Liberal
Assembly of 1941 was the first time that the Party as
such had the opportunity to express an opinion on this
important question. It was therefore with appropriate
sense of expectancy that I arrived at the Assembly ready
to propose the Resolution questioning the whole arrangement
of the Party Truce which I had persuaded my
Bewdley Association to sponsor. My same sense of
expectancy led me to believe that this important item
must occupy pride of place on the agenda. I was,
however, a stranger to the mechanics of democratic
assemblies. Instead of my Resolution being first, it
was placed last! Expectant still, I sat on the platform
awaiting my turn, listening to dialectics on resolutions
on Party policy—policy which under the existing circumstances
could never be anything other than ineffective
"paper" policy. For two whole days, under the chairmanship
of the late Lord Meston, discussion waged to
and fro on trivia of alternative phraseology such as
Party delegates delight to indulge in. Friday went
and so did Saturday morning, and then Saturday afternoon
with the thinning down of the Assembly crowd to
a mere scattering of people. Finally came five o'clock
and the closure with the sorry realization that my
Resolution had been "crowded out."


The Assembly itself had been a blank, but it was the
exasperation caused by these proceedings that produced
the explosion that propelled me on a further stage of my
political career. As the outcome of a hastily-summoned
meeting of the younger members of the Party that took
place after the closing of official business, I found myself
travelling back to Bristol the following morning, the
elected joint secretary of a new Group. This was the New
Liberal Action Group. Its purpose was "that there shall
be a Group of people whose common aim will be to

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

(2)


Back in my exile in Bristol I settled down to the affairs
of the new Group and the consequent correspondence
which it involved with my two co-secretaries, P/O Frank
Rodgers on active service at an R.A.F. camp in Bedfordshire,
and J. A. Paton Walker, solicitor in Kilmarnock,
Ayrshire.


I had been conscious of my own unworthiness for this
post. However, I had one qualification for it that was
beyond dispute, namely that I could devote the whole of
my mental energy and practically the whole of my time
to it. Still endeavouring to discover the purpose of my
job as a Liaison Officer, I had been relegated—doubtless
so that I could ponder this problem more thoroughly—
to a room in the new annexe that had been taken over by
the Ministry of Health on the opposite side of Woodland
Road. In present circumstances this room suited me well.
Such injured feelings as I may have had on account of
my segregation were amply soothed by the improved
facilities which I now possessed for contraband political
work, which gained added zest through the knowledge
that it does not fall to the lot of everyone to run a dissident
political movement from within the bowels of a Regional
Ministry of Health.


The main initial asset of our Group was that we
numbered amongst our members the two youngest and
most energetic Liberal M.P.'s who, had nature fashioned
their characters slightly differently, would indeed have
brought to fruition our cause and our aims. But each of
whom, in the event, played out his own personal
tragedy in such a way as to negative any permanent

[p. <i>213</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first of these was, once again, George Grey. For,
in the brief time that had elapsed since he wrote me the
letter I have published, George had been selected by the
Liberals of Berwick-on-Tweed to succeed to the vacancy
in that division created by the elevation of Sir Hugh
Seely to the House of Lords. Personal jubilation at the
good fortune of a friend was only slightly marred by the
sobering thought that a colleague had accepted a seat in
Parliament under the Party Truce. Not that anyone
could blame him for this! But inevitably it led to a
difference of outlook between us in which I seemed to
detect in George Grey a waning of his sense of the immediate
need to increase the Liberal representation of
the House of Commons now that he was an M.P. himself.
It was even greater misfortune to our cause that, out of
the nobility of his nature, he considered it his duty not
to take advantage of his parliamentary prerogative to
relinquish his commission in the Guards Armoured
Division and that a career of immense promise was cut
short when George Grey was killed in the tank-fighting
in Normandy in August, 1944.


Our other M.P. was Richard Acland. Acland was still
inside the Liberal Party—he had been elected Liberal
M.P. for Barnstable in 1935 and had, in fact, been
organizing his own New Liberal Economic Policy Committee—and
in our headless body it was to Acland that
we turned in the first place for leadership. But Acland
was "difficult"—very difficult! In a reply (headed
"350 Battery, Ealing, W.5.") to my innocuous advances
he saw lurking about the place his enemy—The Unrestricted
Profit-Making Motive.


"OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE <i>NOW</i>" wrote Acland,
"is to try to work out what Liberal policy should be once
it has been accepted that the extension of the scope of the

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Now if this is agreed, it then becomes clear AT A
LATER STAGE, we shall have to GIVE BATTLE to
those who think that the E; of S; of the U: P: M: over
the W: P: S: is the right solution."


(I write this exactly as it appears in Acland's letter.)


Unfortunately his proposition was not agreed to. We
were prepared to discuss; but we were not prepared to
agree with him before we started discussing and this was
what he wanted.


However, by a deft modification of his formula I got
Acland in—for the time being.


Then the bombshell dropped. Writing no longer from
350 Battery, but from the House of Commons (for
Acland had not seen fit to take the same decision as George
Grey in respect of military service) Acland finds that "an
event has occurred which forces me to the conclusion
that as a member of your Committee as it is now developing,
I am a fraud."


The event was a Resolution passed at a Conference
of Mr. J. B. Priestley's 1941 Committee. Acland had
found a wider furrow to plough than that which we could
offer. It was only a question of time before he jumped
the traces and left the Liberal Party to embark on his own
meteoric, if brief, career as a Party leader which will for
ever be one of the wonders of British politics.


It is tempting to compare, after the fashion of Plutarch,
the personalities of George Grey and Dick Acland and,
in doing so, to speculate how different the course of this
story might have been from here onwards, had these two
young and talented members of the Group possessed
something of each other's characteristics. If either George
Grey had had something of the revolutionary fire of
Acland, or if Acland had had something of the stabilizing
intellectual equipment and liberal outlook of George

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My correspondence with Acland continued in desultory
fashion for a year or more. An attempt to fix a debate
with him in January of the following year broke down.
However, in May, 1942, I sent him the Liberal Action
Group Resolutions for a Nine Point Declaration and I
received the comment that "I feel the gap between us is
closing."


But, alas, the gap never closed. When I met him again
in January, 1943, Acland had gone up in the world. He
had by then become an arbiter of men's destinies and, as
such, he was demanding somewhat curtly why I did not
stand for Parliament as a Common Wealth candidate.
To my long letter of explanation of exactly why not, I
received no reply.


However I run ahead of my story.


Let me return to my life at Bristol where, after spending
the day in my secluded office in Woodland Road, I
would walk or take bus across the Downs to 2, South
Dene, Westbury-on-Trym, there to spend the evening
with my letters, with only the break for a chat with Mrs.
Griffn who would on these occasions lapse from her
staunch Conservatism to become my adviser from time
to time in the internal wrangles of the Liberal
Party.


As a change from my correspondence I would, take an
occasional week-end off to attend a meeting of the Group
in London. Our first formal meeting took place during
that autumn of 1941 at the National Liberal Club where,
following a dinner given by George Grey, our conference
debated to a late hour Saturday evening and most of
Sunday as well, producing a number of appropriate
resolutions as its offspring. Then back to 2, South Dene,
to circulate the resolutions and exchange memoranda.

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was one thing to form a Group that called itself an
Action Group, but it was quite another thing to make it
act! Maybe, by dint of striving, I would at our meetings
persuade the roaring lions of the National Liberal Club
Smoking Room to support a motion condemning the
Party Truce for bringing up at the Party Council or the
1942 Assembly. Then, with myself back in Bristol, these
same lions would turn to sucking doves—a telephone
call from London would inform me that more discreet, if
less valorous, counsels had prevailed and we could not
proceed. I had rolled my stone up the hill, only to see
it come crashing down again.

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my struggles against this quagmire of vacillation,
the memoranda that issued from my typewriter became
more and more blazing in their indiscretions. I found
myself blistering what I termed "the small aristocratic
clique" who ran the Liberal Party and sending this contribution
to such as Wilfrid Roberts, M.P., the well-connected
grandson of the Earl of Carlisle. (In truth
the Liberal Parliamentary Party of that era was the
most outstanding example of nepotism of any institution
I have known; but it did not advance one's fortunes
to take upon oneself the responsibility of pointing this
out.)


My crisis came with the Party Assembly of 1942,
when at last a Resolution in the name of J. Emlyn
Jones condemning the Party Truce, by dint of much
pressure from the back of the hall, came before the
Assembly in the final hour. Cajole as I might, I had
been unable to get my "Action" troops into action and
I was left to support this individually, if not entirely
alone. Clearly the time had come for me to hand over
my position in the so-called Action Group to someone
who was more in touch with its changing moods than I
was.


The successor to my position was Lancelot Spicer,
whose father, the late Sir Albert Spicer, had been in one
of Asquith's Governments. No other tiger had growled
more fiercely at the very mention of "action" than had
Lancelot Spicer, who had joined first our Group, then its
Executive Council, in its early days. At the same time
as he had joined A. Everett Jones, who in turn had
interested those twin spirits of Liberal oppositionism in
the War-time Parliament, Clem Davies and Tom Horabin.
So now, notwithstanding the failure to support me
at the Assembly, declarations of undimmed, if occasionally
equivocal, ferocity emanated from the new London
secretariat of the Liberal Action Group, which was

Radical Action—that was the stuff!

But while we had been proposing Assembly Resolutions
and pursuing Group discussions, the political
situation in the country had already drifted beyond the
position where resolutions, memoranda or discussions
inside the Liberal Party mattered very much one way or
the other. Denis Kendall had heralded a new era by
winning the by-election at Grantham as an Independent
Candidate by a majority of 397 from Air Chief Marshal
Sir A. Longmore, the officially-chosen Conservative
"Party Truce" candidate. And, the month following,
similar electoral victories had been won by W. J. Brown
at Rugby and G. L. Reakes at Wallasey. The whole
conception of an official Party withdrawal from the
Truce arrangements was already outdated with such
Independent victories as these. Those whose ambitions
lay within the Party hierarchies might hesitate, but about
the sentiment of a large section of the electors in the
country there was no doubt. It corresponded with what I
have tried to express in these pages—complete loyalty to
the War effort and confidence in Mr. Winston Churchill
as Prime Minister, combined with restiveness at the
frozen position of the representation of the Parties in
Parliament under the Truce.


With Liberals up and down the country sharing in this
feeling, it was wasting time to organize fruitless discussions
at Group Meetings when one might have the
opportunity of joining in this <i>mêlée</i>. Here, in the promotion
of Independent candidatures at by-elections, lay
the open way to increase Liberal representation in the
House of Commons. All that was needed were intelligent

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Let me return to the time in 1940 when I sent my first
circular letter to my fellow Liberal candidates and
received my first batch of replies. The most comprehensive—and
at the same time the most realistic and farsighted—of
these was that of Ivor Davies. His eight
closely-typed pages made an Old Moore's Almanac of
contemporary politics, whose predictions have in the
main been justified by almost every event that has
happened since.


"The main thing," concluded Ivor, "is to do something.
Some of our friends have lulled themselves into
the belief that there is going to be a great landslide towards
us in the immediate post-war years. They are
about as bloody foolish as it is possible to be. The public
will forget our warnings and our wisdom in the flush
of victory."


This was the gist of the letter that was a precursor to
the exchange of correspondence between Ivor and myself
that was to last through the years of the war and indeed
far beyond. The following brief extracts illumine the
course of political event at that time:
<blockquote>
<p>
I.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 27.1.42. "Acland is our principal asset
in the Liberal Party at the present time. He is the only one Liberal
whose speaking and writing is arousing considerable public interest."
</p>
<p>
I.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 25.5.42. "I fear that Acland has stolen
a march on the Party on the question of by-elections. He has at least
succeeded in getting a candidate returned, which is considerably
more than the Liberal Party could do with several years of trying."
(This refers to Acland's support of Reakes at Wallasey)
</p>
<p>
I.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 26.6.42. "The day of the Independent
candidates is at hand now. Acland has won another victory in Maiden

J.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 30.9.42. "I notice that a split has taken
place in the Common Wealth movement. Priestley, Barrlett and to
some extent Gauntlett represented to me the saner aspect of the
movement. It would appear that the future of Common Wealth is
the future of Acland and that is a most uncertain wagon on which to
hitch one's political star." (Acland had, of course, left the Liberal
Party and joined forces with Priestley to form the Common Wealth
movement in the summer of 1942.)
</blockquote>

I.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 27.1.42. "Acland is our principal asset
in the Liberal Party at the present time. He is the only one Liberal
whose speaking and writing is arousing considerable public interest."

candidates is at hand now. Acland has won another victory in Maiden
to-day, I note."



[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I.R.M.D. to D.McI.J. 20.12.42. "On general grounds as far
as by-elections are concerned, I can see a very big difficulty unless
we co-operate with Common Wealth. I am of the opinion that, if we
are to get in, we must compromise with Acland." (Ivor and I had
already got to the stage of discussing our own chances.)


Co-operate with Common Wealth! Compromise with
Acland! Therein lay the crux of the situation in regard to
Independent parliamentary candidatures as the recentlyformed
Common Wealth, and with it the importance of
Richard Acland, grew apace with mushroom committees
springing up here, there and everywhere a few frustrated
socialist intellectuals gathered together, filling the vacuum
left by the self-denying ordinance of the opposition
parties—and in turn drawing support from the wider
frustration that was prevalent during these dull, stagnant
years of the nation's siege.


Apart from Acland and Common Wealth—the field lay
open. The time was ripe for the political <i>entrepreneur</i>
who could stake a claim in the unexplored territory of
anti-Party Truce sentiment, and who was bold enough to
do so. First of all, Ivor and I had thought of contesting
our own constituencies as Independent candidates in
event of their falling vacant and a by-election ensuing.
But then from our own constituencies our imaginations
started to range across those broad stretches of country
where the Liberal vote was still a powerful factor—those
numerous constituencies where in the 1935 Election the
Liberal Party had registered a vote that was second to the
Conservative member and greater than the Labour vote.

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And somehow thus they settled it without a word of mouth


That Gray should take the northern half, while Somers took the
south."


But still there was Acland. Acland and Common
Wealth. Despite oft-repeated public pronouncements of
their desire to co-operate with all other progressive
elements, when it came to detailed points of co-operation
Common Wealth were decidedly tricky. As the fever of
quick success seized Acland and his fellow political crackpots,
their definition of the word "progressive" became
embodied in an ever-narrowing formula.


Meanwhile the same sectarian feeling was rife amongst
the members of our Liberal Group. Now that he had left
the Party, Acland had ceased to be the "white hope" of
all forward-looking Liberals. On the contrary he was
anathema—the renegade who had thrown the Party over
and had not redeemed himself by the full measure of
success that was soon to be his. The very suggestion of
compromising with Acland made one suspect oneself—such
being the hard way of the mediator!


All the same, the day of the Independent candidates
was at hand—it was so much at hand that "everyone and

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An opportunity for contributing towards bringing
order out of chaos came with my acquaintance with Tom
Wintringham. I had met Wintringham, now one of
Common Wealth's national speakers and organizers, at
his Bristol Meeting in November, 1942, and subsequently
lunched with him at his flat in London. As we discussed
the question of mutual support between Common
Wealth and Independent Liberals, it was pleasant to find
him, despite his fire-eating reputation, apparently the
only level-headed person in the whole unstable set-up
with which we had to deal.


I had passed over the Action Group organization to
Spicer and now all my energies were put into these
negotiations with Wintringham, the success of which
would open up so wide a field of opportunity. Sitting in

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The lack of substance behind my pretensions was
undoubtedly sensed when Tom Wintringham accepted
my proposals "for consideration" in February, 1943, but
with an accompanying warning. The policy of cooperations
with Liberals "though accepted by our
National Committee, has not been accepted by our
membership." It would depend on the Easter Conference.


No equivalent show of reluctance was, however, met
with when I put the matter up on my own side:


"I am delighted with your news from Wintringham,"
writes Clem Davies on March 25th, 1943. Clem Davies
and Tom Horabin were by now regular members of
Radical Action and Clem Davies, as the senior Parliamentary
member, was the key person in this situation.


The necessity was now for matters to be put to the
test—for something to happen that would prove that, on
the Liberal side, we were able to implement our owrvside
of the bargain. It only remained for a sufficient number
of Tory M.P.'s to fade out, and for them to fade out in
the right places, and it was in the bag.

Inconsiderately they did not do this. These elderly
parliamentary soldiers did indeed fade away in some
numbers, but not, alas, in the constituencies where it was
favourable for the working out of my scheme. Even as I
made my dispositions, by-elections were in progress at
Eddisbury (Cheshire) and Daventry, where in both cases
local Liberal candidates had arisen in constituencies that
were not on my list. A letter coming from a Bristol sideroad
to these doughty self-appointed champions, asking
them to withdraw and leave the field to Common Wealth,
had less than no effect—I was told to mind my own
business in no uncertain fashion. Nor did it improve
matters when both Heathcote-Williams at Eddisbury and
Dyer at Daventry lost heavily, and at the same time
at Eddisbury Acland showed that he could get his candidate,
John Loverseed, in in the face of Liberal opposition.
(As Ivor remarked in his correspondence "Eddisbury is
rather a shocker.") In fact, the main effect which these
obstinate people had was to discredit Independent
Liberal candidatures in constituencies where they could
be fought with some chance of success.


However, worse was to come. One factor had been
omitted from the calculations in the negotiations between
Tom Wintringham and myself. Namely, that there was a
third element in the struggle for power. These were the
"Independent Independents"—W. J. Brown, Denis
Rendall and George L. Reakes, victors of recent by-elections
who had started to flock together. Denis Ken
dall in particular, with no great background of political
experience, was already fancying himself in the role of
Ringmaker and it was pursuance of this bent that,
when there was a vacancy in the Newark Division, the
adjacent one to Rendall's own constituency of Grantham,
he took interest.


The first intimation of this, as far as I was concerned,
was from Tom Wintringham.

"My dear Johnson," wrote Wintringham on 4th May,
1943, "An awkwardness that has cropped up. Rendall
informed me the day after the vacancy at Newark was
known that he was putting up his brother-in-law as
candidate there as Independent. He claims the support
of W. J. Brown, Clem Davies and Tom Horabin; he will
not get ours, and our area Committee is extremely keen
to fight the seat. I note that it is not amongst those on
your list in which Radical Action should at first sight
appear to be interested. I have not managed to contact
Clem Davies, but hope to do so quite soon."


"Awkwardness" seemed an understatement. Within
six weeks of his welcome of my proposals, my principal
hope, Clem Davies, had thrown them over to go off at a
tangent in this happy family party.


I lay awake at night in agony of mind as if I was once
again back in my youth jilted by one of my sequence of
girl friends—for, in my bereaved personal state, my whole
emotional resources had been poured into my political
intrigues quite as much as into any love affair. It was even
worse than a broken love affair. Not only had I been cast
aside personally—for no word had been vouchsafed to
me from Clem Davies about these recent developments.
But it seemed to me that the whole future of the Liberal
cause had been thrown into jeopardy for the sake of the
bright eyes of Denis Kendall's brother-in-law. And there
was nothing that I could do.


The Newark by-election was the culmination of the
confusion amongst the Independent candidates and their
sponsors that could only have been settled by some such
arrangement as I had tried to work out. At the end of a
bitterly fought election in which Independents scratched
and bit each other harder than they did the common
enemy, the Tory candidate, Colonel Shephard, won the
seat on a minority vote. Kendall's brother-in-law got
7,100 votes; Acland's candidate 3,189; and a Liberal

In the shifting sands of Independent politics, events
had already outrun the arrangements which I had formulated
but a few weeks previously. However, it was not
in my nature to go thus far and then draw back. Discredited
though I might be, with only one or two of my
faithful personal friends adhering to me, I determined
that, come what may, I would still prove my case by
contesting whatever vacancy might occur in any of the
constituencies on my list. With my list at my elbow, I
sat and listened regularly each evening to the news
bulletins—sometimes by myself, sometimes with Mrs.
Griffin listening expectantly with me.


As one parliamentary vacancy followed the other, even
the leaders of the warring Independent factions appeared
to have had enough. After spoiling one another's chances
at Newark, they seemed exhausted. The vacancy at
Burton created by the death of Colonel Gretton was
allowed to go by unopposed. The same happened at
Buckingham.


Such was the state of affairs when, as Mrs. Griffin and
I sat listening to the news early in July we heard that
Colonel Victor Cazalet, M.P. for Chippenham, had been
amongst the victims, together with General Sikorski, of
a plane crash at Gibraltar.


Chippenham was on my list.
