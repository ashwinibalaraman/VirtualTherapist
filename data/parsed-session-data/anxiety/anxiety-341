<b>Abstract:</b> This chapter introduces anxiety disorders and suggests screening, education, and therapy
for anxiety in primary care. The author reviews a comprehensive range of assessment tools,
including medical, psychiatric, cognitive, behavioral, physiological, and neurometric assessment. The
conventional treatment of anxiety disorders calls for anxiolytic and antidepressant medication
combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Mind-body interventions include relaxation therapies,
breathing retraining, biofeedback, and neurofeedback.

<b>Psychological and Demographic Profile of Anxiety Disorders</b>

Everyday life is filled with worries and fears,
some transient and others lingering. Health
professionals designate anxieties, worries,
and fears as anxiety disorders when they
become so intense and frequent as to disrupt
everyday life. Anxiety disorders are among
the most common mental health problems
that health professionals in primary care and
mental health clinics encounter (Kessler
et al., 1994). The Epidemiological Catchment
Area Survey suggests that in the course of a
lifetime, approximately 15 percent of the
population suffers a diagnosable anxiety
disorder (Regier, Narrow, &amp; Rae, 1990).


Anxiety disorders affect all social and age
groups within the population, but several
groups face higher risk. Anxiety disorders are
twice as common in women (9.7 percent incidence
in a one-month period) as in men
(4.7 percent in a one-month period). Population
groups most vulnerable to anxiety disorders
include individuals 25 to 44 years old,
females, separated and divorced individuals,
and those with low socioeconomic status
(Regier, Narrow, &amp; Rae, 1990). The average
age of onset for any anxiety disorder is 16.4
years and even earlier for some disorders. The
average age of onset for social phobia is 11.6
years (Regier, Rae, Narrow, Kaelber, &amp;
Schatzberg, 1998). Early onset of an anxiety
disorder has lingering consequences, with
heightened risk for later major depression and
addictive disorders (Regier, Rae, et al., 1998).

<b>A Comprehensive Biochemical, Psychophysiological, Cognitive, and Behavioral Model of Anxiety Disorders</b>

The current understanding of anxiety disorders
emphasizes the overall interaction of

<b><i>Biochemical Vulnerability</i></b>


Biological psychiatry has identified a
number of neurotransmitters implicated in
anxiety disorders. The unavailability of serotonin
in the synaptic cleft, the gap between
neurons, appears to play a role in obsessive-compulsive
disorder and at least an accessory
role in the rest of the anxiety disorders.
Serotonin serves as a "chemical messenger"
across the synapse. Both anxiety and depressive
symptoms decrease when medication
blocks the uptake of serotonin into receptors
on the neuronal dendrites and increases the
availability of serotonin.


There are also probable abnormalities at
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors
in anxiety disorders. GABA is an inhibitory
neurotransmitter that reduces efferent and
afferent activity to and from the limbic brain
(the emotional brain, including the amygdala
and the hippocampus). When GABA levels
are low, there is a heightening of subjective
distress, including both anxiety and depression.
The benzodiazepine medications,
widely used in anxiety disorders, modulate
the activity of GABA in the brain (Bernstein,
1995; Nutt &amp; Malizia, 2001).

<b><i>Neurophysiological
Activation: General</i></b>


Anxiety disorders most often manifest in
the form of a bewildering array of physical
symptoms, including tense musculature, hyperventilation,
rapid heart rate, chest pain and
tightness, sweating and trembling, dizziness,
racing thoughts, difficulty getting one's breath,
nausea, abdominal discomfort, hot flashes,
chills, and other somatic symptoms. When an
individual feels the presence of threat, whether
objective or perceived, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis mobilizes the body for
emergency action. Current research shows
interaction among neurotransmitter systems,
neuroendocrinological processes, and neuroanatomical
structures in mediating stress
responses, normal anxiety, and the anxiety
disorders (Antai-Otong, 2000).


<b><i>Respiratory Psychophysiology</i></b>


"The mind and breathing are interdependent
and regular respiration produces a
serene mind." (Yue Yanggui, <i>Questions
and Answers of Meisha</i>, cited by Xiangcai,
2000, p. 7)


The physiology of respiration plays a central
role in anxiety disorders (Fried, 1990,
1993; Timmons &amp; Ley, 1994). Rapid
breathing (hyperventilation) "blows off"
carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and reduces CO<sub>2</sub> in the
air stream as well as in arterial blood. This
lowered level of CO<sub>2</sub>, called hypocapnia,
induces cerebral vasoconstriction and
hypoxia and increases sympathetic nervous
system (SNS) arousal and later fatigue.
Hypocapnia causes a rise in blood pH, which
is counteracted by renal excretion of bicarbonate
ion. The resulting changes in alkali
systems and in extracellular and intracellular
chemistry produce many of the symptoms of
hypocapnia (Nixon, 1994; von Scheele &amp;
von Scheele, 1999). The symptoms of
hypocapnia (Fried, 1990, pp. 88-91) show
up in almost all physiological systems:

These symptoms are central to the presentation
of panic disorder and the phobias and
overlap extensively with the symptomatic
presentation of generalized anxiety disorder
and social phobia. Recent research in Sweden
by von Scheele and von Scheele (personal
communication, November 19, 2001) raises
the possibility that hypercapnia may play a
similar role in the etiology of symptoms, but
further research is necessary to clarify the
significance of excesses in carbon dioxide.


There has been controversy about the role
of respiration in anxiety disorders, as earlier
studies sometimes failed to support the role
of hyperventilation in inducing panic disorder
(Gorman et al., 1984; Papp, Klein, &amp;
Gorman, 1993). However, in a series of elegant
empirical studies, often using ambulatory
monitoring of breathing and CO<sub>2</sub> levels
while individuals were exposed to flight and
driving situations, Roth and colleagues verified
the presence of various forms of irregular
respiration and responses to respiration in
anxiety patients. On taking a deep breath,

[p. <i>362</i>]

In another study during an air flight, phobics
paused more during inspiration than
controls (Wilhelm &amp; Roth, 1998a). Phobics
showed more autonomic instability during
flight, including skin conductance fluctuations
and an absence of synchrony between
respiration and heart rate. Both patients with
panic disorder and those with social phobia
felt more anxious during voluntary hyperventilation
in another study, and those with
panic disorder recovered more slowly than
normal controls after hyperventilation
(Wilhelm, Gerlach, &amp; Roth, 2001). Wilhelm
and Roth (1998b) also reported that phobics
showed a greater elevation of heart rate on
entering a plane than controls, suggesting the
role of anticipatory anxiety and its impact on
the cardiovascular system. Other teams have
also recently demonstrated the role of hyperventilation.
Nardi, Valenca, Nascimento,
Mezzasalma, and Zin (2001) showed that
61.5 percent of panic disorder patients, 22.7
percent of social phobics, and only 4 percent
of controls had a panic attack after voluntary
hyperventilation. Abelson, Weg, Nesse, and
Curtis (2001) found striking irregularities in
the respiration of panic disorder patients and
showed that cognitive manipulation could
modify the respiratory pattern.


<b><i>Neurocortical Activation Patterns</i></b>


The human brain, especially the neocortex,
is a critical structure in higher mental
processes such as thinking, attention, and
perception. Electrocortical patterns in the
human cortex shape the current state of
mind and the manner of attunement to the
surrounding experiential world. The state of
mind when the brain is dominated by fast
electrical waves in the frequency range of
20 to 28 Hz is more likely to be worrisome,
fearful, and suspicious, whereas a dominant
pattern of slow waves in the range of 8 to
12 Hz is likely to produce a relaxed, calm
state of mind. Other cortical patterns are
also commonly identified in anxiety states,
including a paradoxical suppression of slowwave
activity (Sattlberger &amp; Thomas, 2000;
Thomas &amp; Sattlberger, 1997) and an overactivation
on the cortical midline overlying
the anterior cingulate gyrus driving obsessional
thinking. Researchers and practitioners
differ in exactly how they designate
frequency bands. However, Table 26.1
shows a typical designation of frequency
bands and a subjective description of the
typical subject's experiencing when each
band dominates the electroencephalograph
(EEG).


Subcortical brain structures also play a
critical role in the emotions, including anxiety.
The emotional brain (or limbic brain)
includes three subcortical structures--the
thalamus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus
--which are functionally organized into
an emotional system integrated with the right
prefrontal cortex (LeDoux, 1996). Other
subcortical structures have been identified as
critical in specific anxiety disorders, including
the caudate nucleus and the anterior
cingulate gyrus in obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and the locus ceruleus in posttraumatic
stress disorder. Early life events, especially
successful mother-child infant bonding,
are critical in the integration of subcortical
emotional systems with cortical control centers.
Problems in early bonding result in
weaknesses in limbic-cortical circuits and a
resultant emotional dysregulation (Schore,
1994). Individuals with emotional dysregulation
remain emotionally reactive and labile
and show extreme swings in anxiety and
mood as adults.

<b><i>Physiology and Cognition:
The Escalation of Anxiety</i></b>


Psychophysiological research on anxiety
disorders shows a variety of symptom patterns,
depending on the specific anxiety disorder
and the individual. In many cases basal
heart rate, autonomic functions, and metabolism
are elevated continuously, with further
elevation during times of heightened anxiety
or panic. These physical accompaniments of
anxiety frighten the anxious individual, and
the person's fear about "what is wrong in my
body" in turn plays a role in further escalating
the anxiety. Clark's (1986) classic formulation
of panic disorder is that the subject
makes a "catastrophic interpretation" of certain
bodily sensations, such as elevated heart
rate, and hence begins to panic (see also
Rachman, 1996). Typical catastrophic fears
in panic are that "I am dying" (from a heart
attack, cancer, or some terrible undiagnosed
disease), "I am going crazy," "I am losing my
mind," or "I am losing control." Cognitive
therapies aim to eliminate or reduce this subjective
escalation of the anxiety response.
The physical manifestations of anxiety may
confuse medical caregivers and lead to costly
testing and treatments, often with little benefit
for the individual.


The cognitive approach to anxiety highlights
the critical role of distorted thoughts
and distorted cognitive schemas in the onset
of anxiety (Beck &amp; Emery, 1985; Salkovskis,
1996; Wells, 1997). The obsessive-compulsive
individual, for example, perceives the
world as a dangerous place full of germs and
sources of contamination. The individual
adopts various safety behaviors to address
this perception of danger, believing that "By
constant cleaning and avoiding contact with
filth, I can survive." The cognitive therapist
challenges the distorted schema of danger
and invites the individual to engage in experiments
that can disprove the fears.


<b><i>Avoidance Behavior and
Stimulus Generalization</i></b>


The obsessive-compulsive example just
described highlights the role of avoidance
behaviors and their interdependence with core
fears and cognitive distortions. The phobic,
for example, adopts the cognitive schema that
"Several places carry special danger for me. By
going there I could lose my mind, die, or lose
complete control." Then the phobic engages
in the defensive behavior of avoiding such
places and situations, hoping to remain safe.
The behavioral avoidance pattern maintains
the perception of threat, as the individual
never enters the situation and never has the
opportunity to master or disprove the fear.


In addition, behavioral approaches
emphasize the "classical conditioning" effect
of stimulus generalization. Once a fear of a
particular stimulus is established, fear begins
to attach as well to adjacent situations and to

[p. <i>364</i>]
<b>Screening for Anxiety Disorders</b>

Anxiety disorders are largely treatable, yet
when they progress untreated, they cause
dramatic suffering and often disability. The
single most important intervention for the
health professional regarding anxiety disorders
is to identify the individual with
anxiety early in the course of the disorder.


<b><i>Anxiety Disorders in
Medical Settings</i></b>


Patients with anxiety disorders present in
high numbers in emergency rooms and primary
health care clinics, yet often anxiety
disorders and other mental health problems
remain undetected. Even when mental health
disorders are recognized, a larger number of
patients receive treatment in general medical
settings than from mental health specialists
(Cummings, Cummings, &amp; Johnson, 1997;
Narrow, Regier, Rae, Manderscheid, &amp;
Locke, 1993). Current health maintenance
organizations have instituted practices,
including gatekeeping requirements and
larger co-pays for mental health than for
medical services, which reinforce the long-standing
reluctance of the general public to
accept referral for mental health specialty
services (Narrow et al., 1993). Cardiac clinics,
gastrointestinal clinics, oncology clinics,
geriatric medicine practices, and other
medical specialty clinics all see large numbers
of anxiety disorders presenting as medical
disorders. Patients with chronic anxiety disorders
have a documented higher incidence
of developing medical illnesses, including
atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular, ischemic
heart, gastrointestinal, hypertensive, and respiratory
diseases (Bowen, Senthilselvan, &amp;
Barale, 2000). Conversely, many specific
medical disorders create increased risk for
anxiety and other mental health disorders.
Children with asthma, for example, report
more anxiety symptoms than do children with
diabetes; those asthmatic children with psychiatric
symptoms also show poorer self-esteem
and lower social competence (Vila
et al., 1999). Adults with asthma suffer similar
elevated prevalence rates for anxiety disorders
(Jonas, Wagener, Lando, &amp; Feldman, 1999).


<b><i>Diagnostic Categories</i></b>


Anxiety disorders are classified according
to objective diagnostic criteria, following the
<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders</i> (or <i>DSM-IV</i>), the diagnostic manual
of the American Psychiatric Association
(1994). The <i>DSM-IV</i> classifies anxiety problems
into panic disorder, the phobias, generalized
anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute
stress disorders, and "adjustment disorder
with anxious features." Pharmacotherapies,
cognitive therapies, and behavioral therapies
have become more effective as research has
allowed the development of treatment plans
sensitive to differences among diagnostic
groupings (Moss, 2001; Moss, 2002).
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example,
responds better to the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and to specific
cognitive-behavioral interventions, such as
"exposure and response prevention." Precise
diagnostic assessment goes farther than specifying
a <i>DSM-IV</i> diagnosis. Identification of

<b><i>Medical Screening</i></b>


Evaluation of anxiety disorders begins
with a screening for medical conditions that
trigger symptoms mimicking anxiety disorders
(Gold, 1989). The initial exam should
include a history, a physical, and lab work as
indicated by symptoms and history. Family
history should include special attention to
cardiac disease, thyroid conditions, depression,
and anxiety disorders in the past three
generations. A family history of cardiac disorder,
for example, can play a twofold role:
(1) genetically by increasing the risk for cardiac
illness that may have triggered current
symptoms, and (2) psychologically by raising
the fear of the patient for any heart irregularities,
even those due to exertion or anxiety.
Table 26.2 lists medical illnesses that cause
symptoms similar to anxiety. Careful screening
for these conditions will accomplish three
interrelated ends: to identify (and manage)
any medical conditions contributing to anxiety
symptoms, to medically reassure the
patient in any unfounded fears of illness, and
to reinforce the patient's acceptance of the
anxiety diagnosis by emphasizing the physiological
link between anxiety and the patient's
current symptoms.


<b><i>Psychophysiological Assessment</i></b>


The Psychophysiological Stress Profile
(PSP) is a tool used to identify the profile of
an individual's personal stress response
(Wickramasekera, 1988) and to demonstrate
convincingly for the patient the mind-body
linkage. The PSP uses a variety of physiological
sensors to monitor the body, first in a
baseline condition, second in relaxation,
third under stress conditions, and fourth on
recovery. Table 26.3 shows a typical PSP
format, using mental math to create the first
stress trial and a visualization of a stressful
situation to create the second stress trial. The
third stress trial consists of hyperventilation
or any another "challenge" activity that can

[p. <i>366</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284025-I036&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

For anxiety, several physiological measures
are relevant for the PSP. The electromyograph
(EMG) measures muscle
tension patterns accompanying fear and
worry. The muscles of the upper torso,
shoulders and neck, and the face are most
likely to show the effects of anxiety. The skin
conductance meter shows an immediate electrodermal
increase when anxious thoughts
occur. Temperature feedback units detect
abnormally low skin temperatures, reflecting
vasoconstriction as a measure of anxiety,
fear, or hypervigilance. The pneumograph
measures patterns in respiration, and
provides a measure of the rate of breathing
and a graphic picture showing how full or
limited and how even or uneven each individual
breath is. The pneumograph also
shows whether the individual is relying on
the muscles of the chest or the diaphragm for
respiration. The electrocardiogram (EKG)
and photoplethysmograph (PPG) measure
heart rate and patterns in heart rhythms that
frequently are affected by anxiety. When
breathing is relaxed, slow, and full and the
individual feels peaceful in both thoughts
and feelings, then the respiratory and cardiovascular
systems enter into a balance called
the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA),
involving a parallel sinusoidal rise and fall in
breathing and heart rate (Porges, 1986; Porges
&amp; Byrne, 1992).
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_24417');">[note]</a><div id="_note_24417" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Physiologically, the paced diaphragmatic breathing induces a
summated or composite frequency made up of both RSA and low-frequency
baroreceptor activity, which some investigators are calling a resonant
frequency (Gevirtz, 1999).</div>
This synchronous pattern
also produces a coherent organization in the
heart rhythms, evident in spectral analyses of
the frequency distribution of heart rate
changes. The patient can observe both the
smooth RSA pattern and the heart rate variability
patterns in the PSP if he or she can relax
adequately either in the relaxation or recovery
trials. (See Chapter 8 for a more detailed explanation
of biofeedback modalities.)


After the patient has seen hand temperature
drop, respiration and heart rates
increase, and muscle tension rise each time
she or he directs attention to job problems or
marital strain, the involvement of psychosocial
factors in physical symptoms becomes
more plausible. Such a profile also indicates
to the patient and the practitioner the physiologic
systems most involved in symptom
production and most relevant to symptom
reduction. Later, relaxation and biofeedback

[p. <i>367</i>]

<i>Capnometric Assessment</i>


The capnometric assessment is a useful
tool, especially in panic disorder, to assess
the presence of hyperventilation and the
extent to which hypocapnia plays a role in
the onset and maintenance of anxiety symptoms.
The capnometer is an instrument that
measures carbon dioxide in the exhaled
breath. This measure is called end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>
(etCO<sub>2</sub>) because it measures the level of carbon
dioxide at the "end of the tide" of the
respiration cycle. The carbon dioxide level is
measured in millimeters of mercury, each
unit known as a Torr. A nasal tube is
inserted into the subject's nostril and taped
into place. The capnometer provides a baseline
value in Torrs for etCO<sub>2</sub>. Normal
breathing should maintain a fairly stable
etCO<sub>2</sub> level at about 40 Torrs. Chronic
hyperventilators, in contrast, show chronic
unstable and low levels of etCO<sub>2</sub>, often 33
Torrs or less. They are closer to the threshold
of hypocapnia and recover less quickly to
normal carbon dioxide levels.


A specialized PSP is conducted in a capnographic
assessment, using a hyperventilation
challenge as one trial. This assessment can be
conducted conjointly with the PSP previously
described. It is important to verify that the
hyperventilation challenge actually involves
hyperventilation. One criterion is to monitor
the patient's respiration with both pneumograph
and capnometer during the hyperventilation,
ensuring that the subject breathes
throughout the trial at a rate of at least 20
breaths per minute and that etCO<sub>2</sub> drops to
a level of 33 Torrs or less.


Conway (1994) suggested the following
criteria for hyperventilation syndrome, based
on a PSP with capnometer:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Resting baseline of CO<sub>2</sub> of less than
30 mm Hg.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. A fall in CO<sub>2</sub> of 20 percent or more from
baseline level during hyperventilation
challenge trials.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Failure of recovery to within 80 percent
of baseline by three minutes after the cessation
of hyperventilation.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. Resting baseline of CO<sub>2</sub> of less than
30 mm Hg.


2. A fall in CO<sub>2</sub> of 20 percent or more from
baseline level during hyperventilation
challenge trials.


3. Failure of recovery to within 80 percent
of baseline by three minutes after the cessation
of hyperventilation.


<i>Neurometric Assessment</i>


Neurometric assessment identifies electrocortical
activation (brain-wave) patterns that
contribute to anxiety and anxious thinking.
Neurometric assessment examines the cortical
EEG and assesses the amplitudes, relative powers,
and frequency distribution of the EEG.
Neurometric assessment can be based on EEG
recording at a single site (such as the vertex, the
site labeled Cz in the International 10-20
System) or at multiple sites. Topographical
brain maps (quantitative EEGs, or QEEGs) are
based on recordings of EEG at multiple sites
(anywhere from 19 to 256 sites), enabling a
sophisticated quantitative assessment of brain
activation patterns, including the presence of
asymmetries between left and right hemispheric
activation and coherence and phase
relationships among brain regions. (See
Chapter 9 for further discussion of QEEG and
neurometric assessment.)


<i>Cognitive Assessment</i>


A number of behavior checklists are helpful
in assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms,
as well as in identifying specific fears
and thoughts active in sustaining the patient's
anxiety. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the
Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Spielberger
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory provide a sampling
of symptoms and numerical severity ratings.
The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale is useful in assessment and in sampling
specific obsessions and compulsions. The
Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale not only provides
a general severity index but also identifies
specific social fear areas and related
patterns of avoidance.

[p. <i>368</i>]

Careful identification of specific individual
cognitive distortions is an important part of
the assessment process. The patient is invited
to voice specific fears accompanying the anxiety
symptoms, to mentally relive that same
fear in the interview room, and to report any
physiological activation or recurrence of
physiological tensions as the fear is experienced.
The interviewer identifies typical cognitive
schemas that frequently involve such
fears. The interviewer need not aggressively
confront the fears in the initial interview but
should emphasize that similar thoughts and
fears often keep individuals anxious and that
treatment includes exploring such thoughts
further and giving up or modifying many
of them.


<i>Behavioral Assessment</i>


Behavioral assessment focuses on identifying
avoidance behaviors, safety (defensive)
behaviors, and superstitious or symptomatic
behaviors related to specific anxieties. The
patient is invited to describe any behaviors or
actions accompanying fears. Is the patient
avoiding going anywhere that he or she used
to go freely? Is the patient engaging in any
superstitious behaviors or behaviors that
don't make sense but that she or he cannot
seem to stop?


In addition, behavioral assessment identifies
patterns of stimulus generalization and
environmental reinforcement of anxious
behavior. The patient is asked whether his or
her fears or anxious behaviors seem to be
spreading to new situations and places. Does
she or he feel any control over this spreading of
symptoms? Does the patient think she or he
can reverse the spread and resume entering
situations recently avoided? What actions
by other people might be enabling or encouraging
the spread of avoidance behavior? Well-intentioned
family members may be doing
tasks for the patient, enabling her to become
more helplessly trapped in self-isolation and
inactivity.


<i>Conceptualizing the Patient's
Anxiety Disorder</i>


The multimodal assessment of anxiety
culminates in a formulation that should integrate
the several strands of the assessment
and lead logically into a strategic treatment
plan. For example, one might arrive at the
following formulation:
<blockquote>
<p>
A 31-year old woman presents with a recurrence
of an obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD). The patient's mother and two
sisters have experienced similar OCD
episodes, and she had a previous episode
that focused on fear of germs and contamination.
She is now afraid that she might see
a sharp object and cut her young child. She
becomes terrified of this possibility and
begins to panic, with racing heart and
hyperventilation. She has begun to avoid
her child, avoids being home alone, and
seeks family members to do child care. She
has no desire to harm the child, only the
intrusive obsessional thoughts that somehow
she might do this. She has no history of
violence, anger outbursts, or impulses
toward abuse. Her assessment emphasizes
the psychiatric diagnosis and family history
of OCD, the cognitive schema that her
impulses are out of control and she might
do anything, behavior patterns of avoidance,
and the physiological processes of
hyperventilation and autonomic arousal.
The treatment plan emphasizes medication
(SSRI), reassurance that the obsessional
ideas are symptoms of OCD, training in
thought stopping and redirecting of her
thoughts, and reassurance that she is a good
mother and can resume care of the child.
She is encouraged to practice her diaphragmatic
breathing and relaxation exercises
that she has previously mastered. The
patient is also informed of neurofeedback
protocols to modify cortical and subcortical
patterns relevant to OCD, especially excessive
activation in and over the anterior cingulate
gyrus. She is a candidate for a QEEG
assessment and neurofeedback training She
delays medication, resumes diaphragmatic
breathing, and begins to redirect and talk
back to her obsessional thoughts. Wich
reassurance and encouragement, her intrusive
ideas remit within less than a week
after commencing treatment.

<b>Treatment Protocols</b>
[p. <i>369</i>]

<b><i>Pharmacotherapy</i></b>


Primary medical care for anxiety disorders
begins most commonly with the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) category
of antidepressants. The SSRIs have a variety
of FDA indications for anxiety. Paxil, for
example, has indications for major depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia,
and posttraumatic stress disorder, yet the
entire group of SSRIs is widely used for most
anxiety disorders. The benzodiazepines are
widely used for panic disorder but present
difficulties with some medication dependency
and complaints of sedation. The benzodiazepines
should be used guardedly with
anyone with a substance abuse history; fixed
schedule regimens are helpful in reducing
benzodiazepine abuse and dependency.
Many primary care practitioners favor short-term
(four- to six-week) use of a benzodiazepine
to provide immediate relief from
anxiety, in combination with long-term use
of an SSRI. Buspirone (BuSpar) is an effective
medication for many patients with generalized
anxiety disorder, as is venlafaxine
(Effexor). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is
most responsive to the SSRIs and frequently
requires significantly higher dosing.


Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress
disorders is often challenging. Patients with
the disorder present a combination of anxiety
and depressive symptoms, ongoing tension
and vigilance, mood lability, and the
characteristic reliving of traumatic experiences.
Antidepressants and benzodiazepines
can be helpful with the anxiety and depression,
and mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium carbonate)
and ant¡seizure medications can
reduce mood lability and vigilance.


Patients not responsive to these medications
may require a combination of
benzodiazepines, two or more antidepressant
medications, mood levelers, and neuroleptics.
Psychiatric referral for evaluation and
medication management should be considered
whenever the patient is not responsive
to first-line medications and wherever polypharmacy
appears necessary.


<b><i>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies</i></b>


Today's treatment of anxiety disorders
relies heavily on cognitive-behavioral interventions.
Many patients benefit simply from
a general orientation to the role of their
thoughts and expectations in triggering anxiety.
Aaron Beck (Beck &amp; Emery, 1985) has
identified a number of common cognitive
distortions relevant to anxiety disorders.
David Barlow (1994) has further identified
critical cognitive and behavioral interventions
useful in reducing anxiety. In addition,
self-help books are widely available and can
guide patients in mastering their own anxiety
(Barlow &amp; Craske, 1989; Burns, 1999;
Craske, Barlow, &amp; O'Leary, 1992; Ellis,
1998; Ellis &amp; Harper, 1975; Weeks, 1978).


The therapist uses assessment to guide
strategic, targeted cognitive-behavioral interventions
with the following goals:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Modify cognitive schemas that elicit
anxiety.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Modify specific thoughts and attributions
that trigger anxiety.

avoidance patterns, that preserve the cognitive
distortions.

5. Assist the individual to confront and master
anxious situations.

Chapter 12 provides greater detail on the
process and technique of cognitive-behavioral
therapy.

[p. <i>370</i>]

<b><i>Relaxation Training
and General Biofeedback</i></b>


Relaxation training is useful in overcoming
anxiety, tensions, and worry (Amar,
1995). Chapter 10 provides an introduction
to progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic
training, and clinically standardized meditation.
Thermal biofeedback helps the patient
learn general autonomic relaxation. EMG
(muscle) biofeedback guides the individual to
relax the expressive muscles of the face and
upper torso. Anxiety, worry, and frustration
typically produce tense muscles around the
eyes and in the jaw, neck, shoulders, and
arms. Skin conductance (elect roder mal)
biofeedback is useful in training the individual
to decrease worrisome thinking and to
quiet anxious thoughts.


<b><i>Respiratory and Heart
Rate Variability Biofeedback</i></b>


Breath retraining, respiratory biofeedback,
and heart rate variability (HRV)
biofeedback are useful tools in reducing anxiety
disorders, especially panic disorder, and
producing subjective calming (Berger &amp;
Gevirtz, 2001; Clark &amp; Hirschman, 1990;
von Scheele, 1998). Paced diaphragmatic
breathing restores synchrony between the
respiratory and cardiovascular systems
(Gevirtz, 1999). Paced breathing produces
RSA, in which low-frequency rhythms prevail
in heart function at a frequency of about
0.1 Hz, or 6 cycles per minute. The heart rate
gently increases with each in-breath and
decreases with each out-breath at a rate of
about 6 cycles of breathing and heart rate
changes per minute. This RSA pattern produces
greater homeostasis in the autonomic
nervous system, reducing anxiety symptoms
(Porges, 1995; Tiller, McCraty, &amp; Atkinson,
1996). New software has been introduced to
enable direct biofeedback training of heart
rate variability, providing an additional tool
to address the respiratory and cardiac
dysfunction accompanying anxiety states
(McCraty &amp; Singer, in press). Many patients
report spontaneous reductions in their anxiety
symptoms in everyday life once they have
begun respiratory and HRV biofeedback.
Others report that they are able to use their
new breathing patterns when anxiety hits
and quickly manage anxiety.


<b><i>Neurofeedback</i></b>


A number of case studies and small
research investigations have applied neurofeedback
to generalized anxiety disorder,
phobic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
and posttraumatic stress disorder
(Moore, 2000). The neurometric (QEEG)
assessment identifies abnormal cortical activation
patterns, and neurofeedback guides
the patient to correct abnormal activation
patterns. Typical cortical patterns in anxiety
disorders include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Excessive fast-wave activity that is high
in the beta frequency range (24 to 32 Hz),
often in combination with deficient amounts
of slow-wave activation. This pattern calls
for neurofeedback training to increase slow-wave
(alpha) activity and suppress fast-wave
activity.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Excessive slow-wave activity that is
often in combination with deficient fast-wave
activity. This pattern calls for a suppression
of slow-wave activity and training to enhance
fast-wave activity (Sattlberger &amp; Thomas,
2000; Thomas &amp; Sattlberger, 1997).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Excessive activity along the midline in
central and frontal areas, reflecting probable
subcortical overactivation in the anterior cingulate
gyrus, driving obsessional thinking.
This pattern calls for neurofeedback training
to suppress the "hot spot" along the midline.

<i><b>Summary: Integrating Treatments</b></i>


The various available medical and mindbody
therapies for anxiety have been discussed
separately, as though each were an
entirely distinct path for treatment.
However, both research and clinical experience
show that therapies can have an interactive
and synergistic effect (see Figure 26.2).
For example, the combination of medication
and cognitive-behavioral therapy produces
faster recovery than therapy alone and
lower relapse rates than medication alone
(Gorman, 1997). Relaxation therapy,
biofeedback, and neurofeedback can also
facilitate the success of cognitive-behavioral
therapy. For example, learning to reliably
create a physiologically relaxed state makes
it easier for patients to undertake exposure
therapy, which requires patients to enter
anxiety-producing situations. On the other
hand, research also shows that mind-body
therapies can produce relatively positive
results in isolation. For example, Berger and
Gevirtz (2001) reported that breathing
retraining alone produced as much improvement
as cognitive-behavioral therapy alone.

<b>Conclusion: Selection of Conventional and Alternative Treatments</b>

The most critical task of the primary care
provider is to <i>identify</i> anxiety disorders and
distinguish them from their frequently
somatic presentation. Next, the health care
provider must <i>educate</i> the patient that anxiety
disorders are troubling bur common and
manageable disorders. Patient education is
critical in dispelling patient shame and denial,
and in countering the common disposition to

[p. <i>372</i>]

You are showing today the typical symptoms
of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders
are real medical disorders, with both
biological and behavioral causes. Many
people suffer similar anxiety; you are not
alone. Help is available, and most patients
with anxiety recover completely. I can teach
you a few simple skills that will help you to
cope with your anxiety. Medication can
also help many patients. If skills and pills
are not enough, I can arrange for an effective
therapist to work with you and help
you overcome your anxiety.


If reassurance is not enough, the health
care provider can provide the patient with
simple <i>anxiety management skills</i>, using
printed brochures and audiotapes to teach
relaxation skills, reassuring self-talk, and simple
cognitive coping skills. At the same time,
the patient should be encouraged to make
changes in everyday life and to eliminate or
reduce any stress load that is triggering or
exacerbating anxiety symptoms. Stress management
classes and individual sessions with
nurse practitioners and health educators can
assist stress management and provide selfregulation
skills in a cost-efficient manner.


Medication can also reduce the frequency
and intensity of anxiety symptoms. Patients
should be reminded that appropriate
medications work best in combination with
increased use of self-regulation skills and
lifestyle changes. Finally, when low-level
interventions fail to reduce anxiety or when
the patient's symptoms disrupt everyday life
to a disabling degree, a referral to a specialist
in cognitive behavioral and mind-body therapies
is appropriate.


As depicted in Figures 26.1 and 26.2, both
the anxiety disorders and their treatment
form a complex structure with discrete neurobiological,
neurophysiological, cognitive,
behavioral, and environmental dimensions.
The behavioral specialist should begin the
treatment process with a thorough diagnostic
assessment identifying <i>DSM-IV</i> diagnosis,
relevant physiological activation patterns,
the presence of dysfunctional breathing,
abnormal neurocortical activation patterns,
cognitive distortions serving to sustain anxiety,
behavioral avoidance patterns, and any
current environmental Stressors. Assessment
guides the selection of the mind-body therapies
most likely to provide patient relief, with
an initial focus on one or two sets of objectives.
Patients with major Stressors should be
assisted in problem solving to eliminate or
reduce the impact of the Stressors. Patients
with dysfunctional breathing patterns should
undergo breath retraining. Patients with
clear cognitive distortions will benefit from
cognitive therapy. The availability of skilled
effective behavioral or mind-body practitioners
will also influence the choice of treatment
interventions.
