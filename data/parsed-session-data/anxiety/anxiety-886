BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I guess I had an interesting weekend. Vicki had a birthday party and so I went down there to go to the party. Also one of my old friends that I hadn't seen since graduation—her name is Tricia—is full of energy and is very upbeat and positive, so it's nice to be around her. I guess I was just wondering where all her energy came from. (chuckles) [00:01:21]
THERAPIST: How she could be like that?
CLIENT: Right. It was good to see her and it was good to see Vicki. Not much happened other than there was a party and a lot of her med school friends were there and I had already met a lot of them so it wasn't very overwhelming. I was tired in the end but I just kind of sat down and was like, "I'm just going to sit." Again, I guess I kind of felt the difference of being the observer than actually participating in life. I did, but I kind of felt it towards the end, but I think that was just because I was cranky and tired and wanted to go to bed. [00:02:28]
THERAPIST: So some of that but, overall, pretty good?
CLIENT: I think so. I was just kind of, towards the end, "I just want to go to sleep." I spent a lot of time running errands for the party. After she graduated she went to a post grad program because she studied psychology and she wanted to become a doctor. She went to school and she said it was a really good experience. Now she's into a program like that. She knew a lot of her mutual friends went to post grad programs for people who have already done science and she said it might be something I could do. [00:03:29] The only thing I said was that those things are very expensive, like another $40,000 a year [to something. I couldn't work.] (ph)
THERAPIST: To add to the cost of your school?
CLIENT: She had a good point. If you're going to make this your whole life, what's one more year? [...] (inaudible at 00:03:52) or whatever. She just suggested if I really wanted to I should do that, so we'll see. (pause) Tricia's kind of crazy in that she comes from a wealthy family so she can do those things. After she did that she (chuckles) decided she didn't want to do that and wanted to spend six months in Africa or something. I don't know. [00:04:35]
THERAPIST: You mean like she didn't want to go to school?
CLIENT: Right. After doing that (chuckles). She's very smart so she can get into programs and jobs very well, but she's kind of also like, "I want to go to Africa for six months," and go do that. I guess I just need to figure out what I want to do. (pause) [00:05:36]
THERAPIST: I had the impression that although you made clear some things about the weekend and especially seeing Tricia, that it felt like you kind of been in a gap a little bit or sort of conveying some of how nice it was to see her and spend time with her. I guess I imagine it might have something to do with having wanted a different response to what you're saying from me.
CLIENT: No. I did have a good time with her and I expressed seeing her because I hadn't seen her in a while. I spent all day Saturday doing things with her and catching up and so I was kind of maybe a little exhausted by the end because she's an awful lot (both laugh), and then we had the party so I think I was just tired. [00:07:08]
THERAPIST: And overloaded by the end of all of that.
CLIENT: I'm not the only one who thinks so. I guess it was nice seeing her because it reminds me of school because she dated a good friend of Vicki's and mine. She always had a "you could do anything" attitude] (ph). She kind of reminded me of school and that got me excited that maybe I could eventually get to school because I told her I had felt pretty defeated after what the [...] (inaudible at 00:07:49) told me. She said it's just one guy. I spent a lot more time with her because Vicki was studying and she and I kind of just were alone. Actually before I came back today and then I have to work today because it's Veterans Day, but it was good. Last night I was a little bummed because I came back from out of town and I'm not [...] (inaudible at 00:08:33), but actually I felt fine. I went for a run today and it felt really nice. I thought about Vicki and how she [...] school friends and, I don't know. I think I liked being alone and ... I don't know. I just enjoyed today and being alone and I felt with Vicki a little bit crazy. I couldn't imagine myself in her situation doing all the school—not school—more the drama of being in a small class and all the stuff that comes from it. I was just thinking about that, I guess, and how I kind of enjoyed today. [00:09:33]
THERAPIST: Right. It's nice to have some peace and quiet absent of drama.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Sounds kind of nice.
CLIENT: Yeah. I was just productive and I did homework and laundry. It was just nice. (chuckles)
THERAPIST: What else come to mind?
CLIENT: I guess I was talking to my mom last night and I don't know if I told you, but a couple of months ago my brother got a DUI. He lives in Miami and ever since then he won't talk to anyone in our family. He won't talk to my mom. He won't talk to me.
THERAPIST: Did you say he got into U of I?
CLIENT: A DUI.
THERAPIST: I thought you said he got into a U of I. I was like, "Oh, for what? And which U of I?" (both laugh) Okay, DUI. That's not something you normally get into. Right—DUI—Miami. [00:11:08]
CLIENT: Something like mom gave him money that he needed for a lawyer and bail and stuff like that but I guess ever since right after it happened he doesn't want to talk to anyone. He kind of did this his freshman year in college—didn't talk to anyone. I don't really care. I think he's just selfish and embarrassed and he thinks that shoving off his family is a way to shed new skin or whatever. That's what I think, but I don't know. I text-messaged him, "You need to call mom. She's worried about you," and he just sends a text back, "I'm not talking to anyone." All right. Whatever. [00:12:12] I guess I just feel bad for my mom because I think she's being flipped for what she did. I was like, "Don't worry about it. He's just being selfish. He'll get out of it." I guess it's just something that has bothered me. Also his birthday is coming up so my mom was like, "Should I send him something?" and I was like, "No." (sniggers) (both laugh) "You can call him. Don't send him anything." (pause)
THERAPIST: That you're kind of annoyed with him?
CLIENT: I guess I was always anxious when I know what he's thinking. I just assume this is what he's doing that. He's being [...] [...] (inaudible at 00:13:14) or something and that context just comes [...]. And also I'm not sure [ phone bill because I get a discount through work and I can see your usage this month. ] (both laugh) I was going to tell my mom. [...] He's using all the data. So that was just the thing that was on my mind. I think it's like, again, when I get [...] or I let things compile it's just like one of those factors like, "My family is weird. My brother is weird." [00:14:08]
THERAPIST: What do you mean "when you let things compound?"
CLIENT: Like when I'm done at night.
THERAPIST: Oh, I see. Like it just piles on top of everything else.
CLIENT: Right. Or it makes me sad. (pause)
THERAPIST: Sort of the feeling of disappointment or hurt or do you know what?
CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. Again, I've always thought my brother was a little selfish. I love him and I like spending time with him, but ever since he went to college we've been on opposite sides of the country. [00:15:07]
THERAPIST: Where did he go?
CLIENT: He went to a small school in Miami. I think I just feel bad for my mom and just sadness. (pause)
THERAPIST: For how he's hurtful to her?
CLIENT: Right. I feel like my mom is lonely. I think she and Stephen are very similar, my brother. I feel like they get along well where I'm more like my dad and I don't want her to think like, "I should have raised them differently." (laughs) Yeah. [00:16:54]
THERAPIST: It really makes her question herself.
CLIENT: Right. Also I feel like she's a little bit lonely and the fact that he's not even going to call her back or e-mail her back. (pause) [00:17:28]
THERAPIST: What else?
CLIENT: I was just wondering what my brother is doing, like what he's doing. He is a bartender or something, so I was just imagining what he was doing.
THERAPIST: You mean like [...] (inaudible at 00:18:06) ?
CLIENT: Yeah. This June he was flying back to Boise for a weekend so I was going back because I haven't seen him in two years. He brought his girlfriend and his girlfriend had her kid; and it was fun, but I guess they broke up and that was the whole reason for the (chuckles) DUI. (both laugh) So I was wondering what he was doing.
THERAPIST: Like what's going on with him or what he's up to?
CLIENT: What he's up to. For a short amount of time when I was a senior in college he lived in Seattle. He decided to move out there [...] (inaudible at 00:19:10), (sniggers) so I saw him more often because he would fly to visit sometimes. He was getting into writing programs or whatever so I was wondering if he was thinking about doing something else for a living; working at restaurants and tending bars and whatever.
THERAPIST: Did you say writing?
CLIENT: I think he wanted to do something like creative writing. He was actually interested in writing at my school because they had a good program in writing, but he never tried to ... (long pause) [00:20:45]
THERAPIST: I'm not sure what to make of it, but today it seems like everybody else has some drama—whether it's Tricia, who just sounds inherently dramatic (chuckles) or your brother's DUI or your mom.
CLIENT: I guess the thing about my brother has been around for [...] (inaudible at 00:21:11) in the background.
THERAPIST: I guess I'm just saying I wonder if there's something to the way that you're talking, to do with—even with your brother who's grown up basically thinking bad, there's something kind of exciting, mysterious, like what in the hell is actually going on with him. You're curious. I don't really know what to make of this or quite where to go with it, but I guess I kind of thought that there's something about you're kind of livelier and like you're finding the drama in the people around you. I think you're feeling yourself kind of in absence of that to some extent maybe as you're talking. [00:22:43]
CLIENT: Maybe with Tricia, not really with my brother. I guess with her I just envy her energy that my life seems lacking. (laughs) I don't even know.
THERAPIST: No. I'm certainly not saying your life is lacking drama, or maybe it is but I didn't have an opinion about that. (laughs) I was more thinking of it as (pause) maybe some way that you wind up kind of feeling like there's more so the people around you kind of have drama, or that there are things going on and you're feeling a bit more shut down by contrast. I'm not even saying you are shut down or you want their drama, but there's some way that you experience this sort of difference where it seems like an important feature of what you're describing. Maybe. [00:24:14]
CLIENT: I guess I agree that I feel like they definitely have more things going on in their lives than I do or, I don't know, involved in more things. I think that, to me, it goes back to I'm observing and not really in life. (pause)
THERAPIST: Actually, that's kind of what makes me want to bring you back to.
CLIENT: I just feel [...] (inaudible at 00:25:19), especially Tricia. Then I'm also like, "Well, who knows?" I can't really know what's going on with my brother and Tricia is kind of—whatever. She's just lying half the time. (both laugh). Whatever. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Like part of what she says is pretty outlandish?
CLIENT: Yeah. She exaggerates. I don't know. She's just one of those she exaggerates. It's kind of like everyone knows it but it's nothing harmful. It's not like what she did. She was flying in and I know her roommate and she was describing, "We go out every night." It's just like, "All right. Sure you do." (laughs) She's always been like that. I like it because—I mean I don't like that she lies—but I like being around her because—I don't know. Not all the time. She's a very caring person. It's not like she's all about herself. (pause) [...] (inaudible at 00:27:10) (chuckles) (pause) Like I said, [...] (inaudible at 00:27:41) (both laugh) In the end it was too much money and I just thought it would be crazy big if it was in there.
THERAPIST: Are you laughing about the bed because you're taking a while to build up [...] .
CLIENT: No. It just came to my mind. (both laugh) Last night my mom [the quote we had for shipping was expiring. Aahh. Don't send it.] (ph)
THERAPIST: I guess I was making a joke because as you had talked and originally brought it up and was saying like, "Why in the hell am I talking about my bed?"
CLIENT: [...] (inaudible at 00:28:37)
THERAPIST: Absolutely. But you decided not to. (both laugh)
CLIENT: (pause) [00:29:14] Tomorrow at work I have a meeting with our collaborators on a product that I've been working on for the last two years. This meeting is getting me a little anxious because I'm the one who did, for this project, all the bench work and all the [...] (inaudible at 00:29:37). I think I mentioned this before. When I first started on this project I didn't realize where it was going. I was given like a test that I just sort of solved and do this protocol, but it was pretty extensive. I was good at doing that, but I wish I kind of knew where that sorting of cells was going (sniggers), because I would have done things a little bit differently to make it easier. This project is called [inaudible] (ph) and, for the first two years, I only knew that I was to do this one part. I didn't really understand. A couple of months ago I understood what we were doing. There are different components to what we were actually doing. I guess it just makes me nervous because they always ask, "Why wasn't this done this way?" or "Why was the database this way? Why wasn't it in this format?" (sighs) It's also such a big project so there's a lot of data and so it's hard for me to format in a certain way because it takes a lot of time and effort. I guess that's what really makes me nervous because a spotlight is put on me how the data is produced and the other PI's are more computational for doing the genetic component, just looking at the data and not looking at the physical cells. I guess it just makes me nervous. I guess I just don't want to be asked why. Why wasn't it done this way? I've been asked a lot and PI's forget maths in every meeting.(laughs) [...] (inaudible at 00:31:52). I was just like, "I didn't know," or "I was focused on this." Those are just highlights, some flaws and mistakes that were made. I don't blame myself for mistakes. I can be kind of like, "Oh, God," but then again I kind of feel like I didn't know what was going on and I couldn't have avoided the mistakes that I made. [00:32:38]
THERAPIST: It's not like they're going to bring up something that's your fault?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's always like ...
THERAPIST: It's not like you have to defend what you've done.
CLIENT: Right. I always get real nervous and upset. Afterwards it's always okay. My old roommate, Samantha, also had a lab job and I think I told you she's the one who went to my school, and we would always come home and we would share our mistakes (laughs) and always kind of kid like [...] (inaudible at 00:33:44). I'm not worried about that. It's just more the embarrassment of the mistakes made. [00:34:04]
THERAPIST: It comes a bit more from you than from them? It's unclear to me how critical they actually are or how much they actually hold you responsible.
CLIENT: It was more like it's there because we sorted these cells from a patient and we had those labeled and then we shipped them off to different companies. We're not really sure if the mistake was made with me sorting the cells and sending them off to different companies or if it was actually the companies. They swapped samples; but because it's genetic data or RNA data, we can trace it back. We can say it's definitely a Caucasian male but the numbers on it say the person was reported as an African-American female, so this is obviously not that person. That's kind of where it is. We're lucky that we have this genetic data and we have computational sciences where we can take it out, but it's always highlighted and it's hard to keep track. That's why I wish I had written down where H2 was exactly. like, "It was in this box." There are 2,400 of these tubes, it's not like there are two. (both laugh) It took me two years to get all of it. In the end I wish I had kept a little bit better track of where all the tubes were, but there were a lot of them. They're in -80° cool freezers. It wasn't like I could easily take them out and have them stay cold. [00:36:12]
THERAPIST: The 2,400 vials or whatever—that was a lot of different people?
CLIENT: There are 600 different people [...] (inaudible at 00:36:22). We sent them to different companies for different kinds of data, but then we want to match them up.
THERAPIST: Like there are different types of data for each person,.
CLIENT: Right. I think about 5 percent of the data is mismatched, which is to be expected because it's human error; but that always falls on me. There are multiple areas for me to make mistakes, like it could be me switching the tubes. Also not all of the patients had all four samples sampled because the machine broke down that day that I was working or I ran out of time or something like that; so it's always like, "Why wasn't this done?" and I'm just like, "Uggh. There are a million reasons." I guess it just makes me nervous. I have regret that I didn't do it better but, again, I didn't know why we were doing it other than I was supposed to sort the stuff. (chuckles) (pause) [00:38:05] I guess I spent a lot of time worrying about these meetings and this project and I talked to my friends and coworkers. I feel like I've had a probably year and a half of [...] (inaudible at 00:38:22), so it makes me a little "Arggh," but in the end I've never been [...]. It used to cause me a lot of stress—like when we were actually sending these tubes it caused me to have stress. Now I'm more like, "Whatever." [00:38:57]
THERAPIST: So it's like you kind of work, go to meetings, and are just upset. You think about it and talk about it some, but it sounds like it was ruling your life a bit more.
CLIENT: Right. It was. I would say last fall and, I guess, this spring it was hard. Now that we have all the data back and I'm not doing all the sorting and I don't have to track all the tubes (chuckles), it's a little bit better. (pause) [00:40:30]
THERAPIST: I guess you're kind of exposed at the meetings.
CLIENT: Yeah. Something about [...] (inaudible at 00:40:40) and also the fact that it's clear to see what the mistakes are, I guess, and the fact that this is supposed to be [...].
THERAPIST: It's sort of like math problems. It's very clear why ...
CLIENT: It's wrong. (chuckles) [...] (inaudible at 00:41:03). It's not hard, I guess, but ... (pause) [00:41:26] My boss keeps putting me on—they just put me on a large-scale project so I guess (chuckles) ... He probably thinks I've learned my lesson about keeping track of everything relative to what position it is. It's more like e-mails will go around that there are this many mismatches, blah, blah, blah, and he'll be upset in the e-mail or kind of like why? And I'll tell him why. (laughs) There were so many tubes. (both laugh) [00:42:17]
THERAPIST: Did I mention there were 2,400 tubes?
CLIENT: I never said there were so many tubes, it was more like there were a lot of samples, the machine broke down so I didn't have them complete, sometimes there wasn't even enough blood from the donor to do everything, so—I don't know. Oh, well. (pause)
THERAPIST: It sounds like you've gotten more confident about it. [00:43:05]
CLIENT: I still feel bad because the two guys, the two computational guys, are the ones writing the paper on this project. They're the ones looking at the data and I feel bad for them; or I feel like I want the data to be good for them and not (sniggers) crap. I don't think it's crap, it's just wasn't what was planned, I guess. I wanted more data and I feel bad. I'm going to have to work with them a lot on fixing the problems. It's just been a constant reminder of, "Uggh. I should have done this better," and I have regrets. It just makes me feel kind of like sick.
THERAPIST: Sick? [00:44:08]
CLIENT: Yeah. Like getting wound up trying to fix what happened or the problems.
THERAPIST: You're saying kind of like a pit in your stomach?
CLIENT: Yeah. A reminder of ...
THERAPIST: I would imagine you feel pretty anxious and pretty sad that you sort of sent it off to some extent and know that your boss still thinks well of you and it's not the end of the world and people, whether it was you or somebody else, make mistakes; but I guess it sounds like on a different level it pretty much sucks.
CLIENT: I guess it's also because it's multiple labs. I don't know. It's not just my boss it's (chuckles) also other people.
THERAPIST: We need to stop for now. We'll talk more tomorrow.
CLIENT: I'll see you.
THERAPIST: See you.
