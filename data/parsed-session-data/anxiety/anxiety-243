<i>Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but pay no attention to the log in your
own eye? How can you say to your brother, "Please, brother, let me take that speck out of
your eye, " yet cannot see the log in your own eye? ... First take the log out of your own
eye, and then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye</i>.


—Luke 6:41-44


The essence of supervision for group
leaders is to help them remove the "logs"
(e.g., anxiety, insufficient skills, limited
awareness of self or group process) from their
own eyes so that they might intervene more
effectively (i.e., help group members to take the
specks out of their eyes as well). Of course,
given the complexity and intensity of group
leadership, there is no shortage of potential logs
to dislodge in the eyes of both beginning and
experienced group leaders (DeLucia-Waack,
1999; Hayes, 1995). Clearly, the supervision of
group leaders is of paramount importance to the
field of group leadership.


The purpose of this chapter is to review the
theory, research, and best practices related to
the supervision of group leaders. The focus is
primarily on the aspects of supervision that

IMPORTANCE AND Focus
OF SUPERVISION FOR GROUP LEADERS


The Association for Specialists in Group
Work's (ASGW) <i>Professional Standards for the
Training of Group Workers</i> (2000) specifies a
minimum level of 1 hour a week of planning
time for group leaders (either individually or
with a coleader). According to these standards,
leading effective groups demands constant
assessment of leader skills and interventions,
group development, and individual progress of
group members. Thus, the supervisor and group
leaders must understand the unique characteristics
of the group being led in order to provide
effective supervision (ASGW, 2000). Furthermore,
the ASGW <i>Best Practice Guidelines</i> (1998) consistently
emphasize the importance of supervision
and/or consultation with other group leaders
as an integral part of effective and ethical group
leadership. Specifically, these standards state
that group leaders must act as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
Process the workings of the group with themselves,
group members, supervisors or other colleagues,
as appropriate. This may include assessing progress
on group and member goals, leader behaviors and
techniques, group dynamics and interventions,
and developing understanding and acceptance of
meaning. Processing may occur both within sessions
and before and after each session, at time of termination,
and later follow up, as appropriate (p. 4).

Process the workings of the group with themselves,
group members, supervisors or other colleagues,
as appropriate. This may include assessing progress
on group and member goals, leader behaviors and
techniques, group dynamics and interventions,
and developing understanding and acceptance of
meaning. Processing may occur both within sessions
and before and after each session, at time of termination,
and later follow up, as appropriate (p. 4).


Unfortunately, other than ASGW, no professional
organization has suggested guidelines for
the supervision of group leaders. Furthermore,
the field of supervision has paid little attention
to the supervision process of group leaders
(Kleinberg, 1999), although current research
on the supervision of individual counseling
and psychotherapy suggests that a positive
supervisory relationship is helpful and important
for trainee development and effective in
improving client outcome (Bernard &amp; Goodyear,
1998; Lambert &amp; Ogles, 1997; Worthen &amp;
McNeil, 1996).


What little research has been done specific
to supervision of group leaders suggests
the importance of supervision. Ebersole,
Leiderman, and Yalom (1969) reported that
without supervision, group therapists were not
able to identify mistakes and generate new plans
of action; instead, they became stuck in a cycle
of repeated ineffective interventions. Furthermore,
Leszcz and Murphy (1994) found that
complaints about technical difficulties, such as
recruiting and retaining group membership, did
not distinguish satisfied from unsatisfied beginning
group leader trainees. Rather, the quality
of the supervision relationship was the chief
variable associated with training satisfaction.
Specifically, dissatisfied group leader trainees
reported feeling "unheard," "criticized," and
"unhelped," whereas satisfied trainees reported
feeling "supported" and "empathized with"
(p. 100). In an attempt to identify the effective
elements of group supervision, Marshall (1999),
through a survey of group leaders, noted four
important variables: acceptance and support
(e.g., I can talk about mistakes and it is okay);
play (e.g., We have a lot of fun); tolerance and
enjoyment of primary process (e.g., When I
could feel and act as dysfunctional as the
client, the whole case turned around); and resolution
of intergroup conflict (e.g., When
we have our differences, we are able to talk
about them).


CRITICAL EVENTS IN THE
SUPERVISION OF GROUP LEADERS


Supervising group leadership is much more
complicated than supervising individual counseling
because of the multiple participants and
relationships involved in both group membership
and leadership (DeLucia, Bowman, &amp; Bowman,

[p. <i>138</i>]

Anxiety


Leszcz and Murphy (1994) identified several
sources of anxiety for group leaders, including
the fear of losing control, appearing incompetent,
becoming overwhelmed by the sheer
volume of material, contributing to premature
terminations, and exposing personal and professional
weaknesses. Supervision may help group
therapists alleviate some of these fears. For
instance, in their qualitative investigation of
neophyte group therapy trainees, Murphy,
Leszcz, Collings, and Salvendy (1996) noted
that intense anxiety seemed to be a universal
experience among trainees. Furthermore,
empathie uncovering and exploration of anxiety
in supervision seemed to help group therapists
to appropriately manage anxiety and decrease
negative affect. Overall, they suggested that
effective supervision could contain and reframe
the anxiety.


Christensen and Kline (2000, 2001) conducted
two qualitative studies of beginning
group leaders' experience of receiving supervision
in a group format. In both studies, they
found that "participant anxiety" (i.e., emotional
reactions, thoughts, and behavioral choices
related to anxiety in group supervision) permeated
the experience of the group leaders in
supervision. In the earlier study (Christensen &amp;
Kline, 2000), they found that the group leaders
were initially anxious and thus hesitant to participate
in supervision. As the level of trust and
support in the supervision group increased,
however, anxiety became a motivating aspect
of group supervision, fueling feedback and
group interaction, especially when anxiety was
perceived as facilitating learning (i.e., If I am
anxious, then it is because I need to ask for help
in supervision to learn a new skill or approach)
rather than when it was related to the fear of
being perceived as incompetent. In their 2001
study, Christensen and Kline found that the result
of coping with participant anxiety included
enhanced insight regarding relationships with
their coleaders and significant others, increased
understanding and development of group facilitation
skills, and improved interpersonal interactions.


Starling and Baker (2000) and Newman and
Lovell (1993) provided support for the importance
of dealing with anxiety in the group supervision
of group leaders. Specifically, Starling and
Baker's qualitative analysis revealed that
decreased anxiety and confusion enhanced
group supervision of group leaders. In addition,
Newman and Lovell, based on a case study, suggested
that "significant and difficult moments in
group supervision were often inseparable
because the successful resolution of challenges
often left favorable impressions" (p. 29).


Parallel Process


Although definitions of parallel process vary,
the common element among them is the reenactment
of the counseling relationship within
supervision, focusing on impasses, resistance,
and other distortions in the counseling relationship.
Because there are so many opportunities
for relationships at different levels to affect
other relationships, parallel process becomes
more complex and important to attend to in the
supervision of group leaders (DeLucia et al.,
1989). DeLucia et al. noted, "As the counselor
explores conflicts and blocks, the supervisory
relationship itself becomes the source of learning
and growth about the counseling relationship,
thus facilitating adaptive counselor interactions
with clients" (p. 232). Psychodynamic theorists
have consistently emphasized the importance of
parallel process in groups. For example, Spotnitz
(1958) pointed out that experienced group therapists
engaged in group supervision were no
more immune to the complex phenomenology

[p. <i>139</i>]

Holmes, Stader, Swaim, Haigler, and
Myers's (1998) qualitative analysis of the journals
of group therapists in group supervision
revealed a clear similarity between the needs of
group members and the needs of group leader
interns in group supervision. Specifically, they
noted parallels of information giving and problem
focus during the initial stage, a focus on
skill development and identity development
during the middle stage, and closure and consolidation
of skills and knowledge during the
ending stage of group for both group leaders in
supervision and group members in their groups.


Two clinical examples provide further evidence
of the importance of parallel process in
the supervision of group work. Rosenberger,
Fauth, and Gehlert (2003) described two group
facilitators of a men's therapy group engaged in
an unconscious struggle for control of the direction
of the group, thereby leading to a "stalemate"
in both the group and in supervision.
After several weeks, this dynamic was finally
made explicit and discussed at the prompting of
the supervisor during their supervisory session.
In the group session immediately following this
discussion, the members challenged the leaders
for the first time, the successful handling of
which ultimately led the group to enter the
working stage. Friedman and Handel (2002)
presented the concept of "reverse parallel
process," which occurs in supervision groups by
containing and working through difficult emotions
disowned by the therapy group and subsequently
results in changes in the functioning of
both the supervision and therapy groups. In
essence, they were naming the process whereby
in supervision, group leaders examine and work
through the parallel process that has occurred
from their group to the supervisory group; and
thus, they are able to affect their counseling
group based on insight gained from the supervi
group.


Countertransference


Countertransference is postulated to increase
exponentially when working with groups
(Hayes, 1995). Although definitions of countertransference
abound, current scholars who
distinguish between therapists' "real" and
"unreal" reactions define <i>Countertransference</i> as
irrational reactions emanating from therapists'
unresolved personal issues (Corey &amp; Corey,
2002; Fauth &amp; Hayes, 2002; Gelso &amp; Carter,
1985; Yalom, 1995). Unfortunately, countertransference
has been virtually ignored in the
research on group counseling and supervision of
group therapy (Hayes, 1995). Thus, supervisors
are in the unfortunate position of extrapolating
from research on Countertransference in individual
therapy to the supervision of group leadership.
This section has been arranged according
to four components of group Countertransference
identified by Hayes: origins, triggers, manifestations,
and management.


Countertransference <i>origins</i> are therapists'
unresolved personal issues (Hayes, 1995).
Countertransference origins likely to be evoked
in group therapy include reactions to authority,
conflict, and anger; narcissistic needs; cultural
values; excessive need for control; family
issues; and separation-individuation issues
(Halperin, 1989; Hayes et al., 1998; Slavson,
1953; VanWagoner, 2000). Countertransference
<i>triggers</i> are the therapy events and/or client
characteristics that evoke therapists' unresolved
conflicts (Hayes, 1995). Group leadership, due
to its complex, interactive, and affective nature,
is probably even more likely than individual
therapy to trigger therapists' unresolved conflict
(DeLucia-Waack, 1999; Hayes, 1995; VanWagoner,
2000). Therapists could have their
personal reactions triggered by individual group
members or their cotherapists as well as the
group as a whole (Hayes, 1995). Specific Countertransference
triggers in group tend to be
related to conflict, competition, resistance,

[p. <i>140</i>]

Countertransference <i>manifestations</i> are
myriad cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
reactions that therapists exhibit when countertransference
is triggered (Hayes, 1995). When
therapists' personal issues are triggered, their
Countertransference manifestations typically
take on either a positive or negative valence
(Fauth &amp; Hayes, 2002; Friedman &amp; Gelso,
2000; Hayes et al., 1998) and are manifested in
many idiosyncratic ways (e.g., overly critical
behavior, anxiety, boredom, avoidance, overinvolvement)
(Halperin, 1989; Hayes, 1995).
Regardless of the specific form it takes, the hallmark
of Countertransference manifestations is
that they are extreme in some way or represent
some departure from normal clinical practice
(Hayes, 1995).


To cope with their Countertransference,
group therapists may employ one or more Countertransference
<i>management</i> strategies, such as
denial, repression, personal therapy, and (ideally)
supervision (Hayes, 1995). Group theory
posits that one of the greatest benefits of supervision
of group leaders may be to help manage
(rather than necessarily prevent) and normalize
Countertransference (Flapan &amp; Fenchel, 1984;
Halperin, 1989, Vannicelli, 1991). Identification
and exploration of Countertransference in
the context of a safe and supportive supervisory
relationship is touted as probably the most
effective Countertransference management strategy
for group therapists (Kleinberg, 1999;
Murphy et al., 1996; VanWagoner, 2000).


For example, Cohen, McGrath, and Sharpe
(1991) reported two case studies that emphasized
the importance of supervision for successfully
identifying and managing group
Countertransference. In both cases, the discussion
of Countertransference in supervision
resulted in recognition of how it had blocked
important information about and reactions to
group members based on the group leaders'
unresolved family issues that were displaced on
to group members. Cohen et al. postulated that
discussion and recognition of the Countertransference
resulted in changes in group leader
behavior and impact within group sessions. In
sum, the scant empirical evidence on individual
counseling as well as current group theory suggests
that countertransference can have positive
or negligible effects on therapy outcome if
successfully managed, but deleterious effects
if unrecognized or poorly managed. Thus, an
imperative task in the supervision of groups is to
help group leaders identify, discuss, work through,
and successfully manage their countertransference
reactions in group.


MODELS FOR SUPERVISION
OF GROUP LEADERSHIP


Several models of the supervision of group
leaders, each with distinct advantages, have
been developed. Supervision of group leaders
occurs in various modalities, including supervision
of an individual group leader or coleaders,
supervision by one member of a coleadership
dyad by the more experienced coleader (dyadic
supervision), and group supervision of multiple
group leaders. Variations as to how supervision
is delivered will be discussed in this chapter.
Furthermore, several authors have proposed
theoretical models of supervision for group
leaders designed for a specific modality and
include different tasks for different developú
mental stages. These models follow, along with
relevant research.


Models of Supervision
for Individual/Coleaders


<i>Supervision of a Group Leader</i>


Little has been written about supervision of
one group leader conducting a group, although
it probably occurs quite often in counseling
practice. What can be inferred from the individual
supervision literature is the importance of
emphasizing three areas in supervision: case
conceptualization, development of skills, and
resolution of personal reactions that interfere
with successfully intervening in group situations
(Bowman &amp; DeLucia, 1993). Case conceptualization
includes discussion of group dynamics
and interactions between members. Development
of skills focuses on the implementation of
counseling skills to facilitate group discussion,n

[p. <i>141</i>]

<i>Dyadic Supervision</i>


Leszcz and Murphy (1994) defined dyadic
supervision as an "apprenticeship model in
which a more experienced group leader co-leads
with an inexperienced trainee" (p. 99). This
senior-junior group leadership model is quite
common. Bridbord (2003) found that in her
national sample of 51 coleadership pairs, 29% of
them were composed of senior-junior leadership
teams. Leszcz and Murphy stated,


Benefits of such a model include the trainee's
opportunity to observe directly how an experienced
leader conducts group psychotherapy.
Similarly, the junior leader may be able to receive
direct feedback from the supervising leader about
his or her therapeutic style and use of therapeutic
interventions, (p. 110)


Tuckman and Finkelstein (1999) suggested
several dilemmas that may arise for the more
experienced coleader: choosing to have a group
therapeutic impact versus supervisee-training
impact, the unidimensionality of the analysis
of countertransference, choosing to discuss
the supervisor's countertransference versus
overwhelming the new trainee, managing the
balance of interventions in session by both
coleaders, and idealization of the supervisor by
the new trainee.


<i>Triadic Supervision</i>


Triadic supervision consists of both
members of a coleadership team and a supervisor.
The advantages of triadic supervision
include the provision of comprehensive reporting
about the group in supervision as each cotherapist
serves to correct each other's blind spots
(Leszcz &amp; Murphy, 1994). Their ability to give
one another feedback and together examine the
group process, transference, and countertransferential
developments within the group and the
interpersonal processes can provide significant
amounts of support and information.


However, the cotherapy team is subject to its own
process and dynamics, and supervision needs to
address issues that invariably arise, including
issues of competence, dependency, and rivalry.
How the co-therapy relationship develops influences
dramatically how the group will function.
(Leszcz &amp; Murphy, 1994, p. 112)


Nakkula and Watts (1997) suggested that a
uniqueness of supervising group coleaders is the
focus on their relationship, the "friendship-in-the-making"
as they refer to it, which requires
an interpersonal focus for supervision (p. 145).


The benefits of coleadership are often
described in the literature, though little research
has been conducted on any aspect of it. There
have been several proposed models of group
coleader development (e.g., Brent &amp; Marine,
1982; Gallogly &amp; Levine, 1979; McMahon &amp;
Links, 1984; Stempler, 1993) that are relevant
as a background for discussing triadic supervision.
While previous models of group leadership
development vary in the number and emphasis
of stages, Dugo and Beck (1997), drawing from
earlier models in the literature, suggested a
coleadership model of development that consisted
of nine phases. In Phase 1, "Creating a
Contract," the coleaders establish a foundation
by creating formal norms for the critical aspects
of their relationship and for the conduct of
the group. In Phase 2, "Forming an Identity,"
cotherapists establish an initial identity as a
team and form the structure of their relationship.
In Phase 3, "Building a Cooperative Team," the
cotherapists have made basic structural decisions
and are ready to move into the information
gathering that can set up a collaborative working
relationship. In Phase 4, "Developing
Closeness," the cotherapists establish a deeper
interest and attraction based an actual working
knowledge of one another. In Phase 5, "Defining

[p. <i>142</i>]

Often, working with a coleader greatly
enhances the effectiveness of group work interventions
but necessitates more time and attention
to the coordination of joint leadership
efforts (Yalom, 1995). This additional attention
also carries over in triadic supervision. While
acknowledging the benefits of triadic supervision,
Stempler (1993) cautioned that it is not
easy to create an appropriate balance of power
where "both co-leaders can simultaneously
learn from each other, grow from the experience,
and model a healthy balance of authority
and intimacy for their groups" (pp. 97-98).


Leszcz and Murphy (1994) made several
recommendations that are relevant for triadic
supervision:


Supervision ideally encourages the development
of an effective relationship between the co-leaders
without siding with one in any conflict. A systemic
view of the contributions of the group, the co-therapy
team, the supervision, and the multiple
levels of relationships both empowers the supervision
and illuminates the impact of interpersonal and
group process.... Whenever possible, linking the
co-therapy process to the group process may help
resolve difficulties between the co-therapists, as
the only real supervisory leverage present is what
is in the best interest of the treatment, (p. 113)


DeLucia et al. (1989) presented a model for
supervising coleaders that was based on the
developmental tasks proposed by a group stage
model and emphasized the parallel processes
that occur in the development of the group and
coleader relationships. They suggested that for
group leaders to facilitate the attainment of
tasks by group members at each group stage,
they must have first worked through those tasks
as a dyad. For example, as group leaders learn
how to give each other constructive feedback,
they are more encouraging of similar behavior
in their group members. Specifically, DeLucia
et al. (1989) suggested,


[The] stages of group process are parallel to stages
of co-leadership development; thus, successful resolution
of issues and tasks for the leaders result in
heightened ability to help group members resolve
similar issues and facilitates movement through
the stages of group development. Counselors are
able to facilitate resolution of similar tasks with
their clients to the extent they have addressed those
tasks in the supervisory relationship, (p. 233)


Initially, coleaders, like new group members,
may be anxious or uncomfortable about self-disclosing
deeply in supervision, taking risks,
and trying different behaviors because of the
newness of the supervisory relationship. Thus,
DeLucia et al. (1989) postulated that it is important
to acknowledge and successfully manage
this anxiety and discomfort in supervision. To
facilitate this process, a structure must be created
for coleaders to feel safe and understand
the boundaries of supervision, so that they can
take risks and honestly assess the success of
their interventions in an effort to promote new
and effective behaviors in future sessions. It is
also important for coleaders to explore their
relationship in terms of session planning and
processing, giving and receiving constructive
feedback (to each other and the group
members), and helping members formulate and
achieve individual goals.


As group members move out of the beginning
orientation stage, DeLucia et al. (1989)

[p. <i>143</i>]

DeLucia-Waack (2002) extended DeLucia
et al.'s (1989) model with suggestions for facilitating
the developmental tasks of each stage in
supervision with group coleaders. Supervision
tasks and interventions are identified as the
coleader relationship progresses in supervision.
Three major tasks for supervisors are identified
for a new supervisory relationship. The first task
is to revisit major sources of information about
supervision and group leadership (e.g., ASGW,
1998, 1999, 2000; Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 1992).
The second task is to gather information about
the specific type of group the supervisees will
be leading, such as foci, goals, and interventions.
The third task is to examine the supervisor's
specific beliefs, theoretical orientation,
and expectations about supervision in order to
be able to articulate these to new supervisees.
According to DeLucia-Waack (2002), the middle
stage of supervision is focused on the evaluation
of the effectiveness of group interventions.
At this stage of supervision, coleaders reflect on
what happens in group sessions in terms of critical
events, interventions, leader and member
reactions, and member progress in an effort to
evaluate effective leader behaviors, plan for
future sessions, and explore new behaviors,
interventions, and strategies. At this stage, case
conceptualization, techniques and interventions,
and personal reactions are the foci.


DeLucia-Waack (2002) suggested a format
for each supervision session that allows time for
discussion, planning, and processing. She
included the following five steps: (a) <i>reporting</i>
of what specifically happened in the last session
in terms of critical events, member behavior,
and leader interventions; (b) <i>reflection</i> on what
happened in the last session, specifically in
terms of what worked and what did not work,
and what produced emotional reactions from
coleaders and members; (c) <i>integration</i> of events
in group sessions with theoretical perspectives
on group stages, therapeutic factors, leader
interventions, member psychosocial development,
and progress toward member goals;
(d) <i>planning</i> for what needs to happen in the
next session in terms of content and process,
group interventions, and interventions directed
at specific members; and (e) <i>evaluation</i> of what
was learned during the supervision session and
how it will be applied. The format is postulated
to provide structure and reduce anxiety for
group leaders as well as to allow them to reflect
on what was effective (and what was not) in
order to plan for future group sessions. Conyne
(1999) and Brown, Spenser, and Dlin (1990) have
also suggested similar outlines for supervision
sessions of group leaders.


Several authors have suggested formats for
written notes used by coleaders as part of the
supervision process. DeLucia-Waack (2002)
suggested the use of "Planning and Processing
Sheets" to initially guide the group leaders as
they reflect on their group sessions and to provide
the supervisor with information prior to
supervision. Brown et al. (1990) suggested a
similar schema, titled the "Group Recording
Form." Bloch, Brown, Davis, and Dishotsky
(1975) also emphasized the use of a written
summary of each group session dictated by
coleaders as a narrative account of the meeting
that provides the supervisor with more time to
focus on particularly striking elements of a
group session, including critical process events,
dynamics of patients, and intervention strategies.
Aveline (1986) advocated the use of
written reports in brief-group-psychotherapy
training focusing on the following questions:
(a) What themes were present in the session?

[p. <i>144</i>]

Models of Group
Supervision for Group Leaders


Group supervision of group leaders is costefficient
in that several students can be supervised
at one time, with the added benefit of
having multiple viewpoints and feedback
exchanges. Newman and Lovell (1993) noted
the advantages of group supervision for group
leaders as being an "excellent forum for obtaining
feedback, encouraging healthy coleadership
relationships, enhancing group facilitation
skills, and fostering counselor-in-training self-awareness"
(p. 22) as well as gaining valuable
insights into group process.


Almost all models of group supervision of
group leaders emphasize the application of group
dynamics and vicarious learning principles to the
supervisory relationship. Werstlein and Borders
(1997) emphasized the importance of "group
process to enhance learning" (p. 2), although the
incorporation of group process into supervision
groups is used infrequently in actual practice
(Riva &amp; Cornish, 1995).


A majority of the models emphasize the usefulness
of parallel process events and countertransference
reactions in learning effective
group leadership skills. For example, Leszcz
and Murphy (1994) concluded that a group
model of supervision "most directly realizes
group process and provides participants with
firsthand exposure to group dynamics through
actual group participation" (p. 107).


Altfeld and Bernard (1997) suggested that
several important dynamics related to group
leadership are most effectively dealt with in
group supervision: competitiveness, dependency,
and the advantages of collaborating in a
"lonely profession." VanWagoner (2000) noted
anger and aggression as essential elements in
groups, thus making these inevitable topics in
supervision for group leaders.


Group supervision of group leaders offers
unparalleled opportunities for emotional and
intellectual learning. The presence of fellow group
leaders who are emotionally responsive to others
"acts as a powerful solvent for countertransference
resistance, and the group itself offers rich learning
inherent in the frequent re-enactment of the
dynamics of the treatment situation" (Altfeld &amp;
Bernard, 1997, p. 390). Glatzer (1971) noted,


The use of the group process is particularly appropriate
in the supervision of analytic group therapy
because the subtle nuances of group transferences,
multiple resistances, and interlocking mechanisms
of defense can be illustrated and that experiencing
their own fears of exposure to the group, their own
competition for and with the supervisor, and their
own rivalry with one another helps group trainees
empathize with the members of their own groups,
(p. 436)


She also emphasized that the supervisor has
the opportunity to model key aspects of the
group leader role, from forming the group
through termination. This modeling also
includes in vivo resistance recognition, exploration,
and resolution at individual, subgroup,
and group-as-a-whole levels.


Within supervisory groups, group leaders'
"resistance to cooperative functioning with each
other and with the group leader are permitted
to emerge, be studied, and be resolved"
(Rosenthal, 1999, pp. 211-212). Cooper and
Gustafson (1985) provided two case examples
of how to explore countertransference by discussing
the parallel process that occurred in
group supervision. One example relevant to parallel
process focused on the supervisor commenting
that the pressure that he felt to provide
answers to the supervisees was equal to the
pressure that the supervisees were feeling from
some of their more difficult clients. This comment
thus freed up the supervisor and supervises
to discuss responsibility felt toward group
members and how to provide support and feedback
rather than solutions, resulting in different
interactions in supervision and group sessions.


Aronson (1990) suggested that the effectiveness
of group supervision of counselors, paralleling
the effectiveness of group counseling and
therapy, is dependent upon three factors: (a) the
contributions of the leader, (b) the group
members' interactions with the leader and with
each other, and (c) the benefits derived from
belonging to a valued group.

[p. <i>145</i>]

Kleinberg (1999) suggested three major
areas of intervention. The first area of intervention
is the balance between the experiencing and
reflecting egos. He summed it up eloquently by
saying,


A strong supervisory alliance makes it possible
for the supervisor, perhaps assisted by one or two
of the supervisees, to step up on the perch and
place the events of the treatment group in a
dynamic perspective. The climate in which all this
takes place can enhance the receptivity of the
supervisees to what is being offered to them from
the supervisory team. (p. 161)


Kleinberg's (1999) second emphasis was
creativity. He believed that clients would experience
textbook-derived responses as wooden;
therefore, he believed that supervisees should
work to translate supervisors' and peers' ideas
into their own personal therapy styles. The
third area was assessment of the group leader's
"clinical skills, knowledge of psychodynamic
theory, knowledge of group-dynamics theory,
self-reflective capacity, consultation skills, and
supervisory capacity" (p. 163).


Using a case study, Newman and Lovell
(1993) developed a model of group supervision
for group leaders that focuses on the needs of
the group leaders based on the stage of the
supervision group and the counseling groups
being led. During the initial stage, the major
tasks of the group supervisor are to set norms to
create safety within the group, encourage individual
goal setting, and initiate a collaborative
group atmosphere. During transition, control
issues are important. The major tasks for the
group supervisor focus on encouraging independence
through immediacy skills and helping to
resolve client differentiation struggles. During
the working and final stages, the major topics
are affect and termination. The focus includes
taking ownership of the group and planning for
termination.


Altfeld and Bernard (1997) presented an
experiential model of group supervision emphasizing
concepts from object relations, group-as-a-whole
dynamics, and gestalt theory, based on
the following assumptions: (a) The group leader
is discussing his or her group in supervision
because he or she wants help with the case, is
stuck in some way, and is not seeing clearly
what is going on in the therapy; (b) the group
leader's countertransference feelings being
expressed will begin a parallel process in the
supervisory group; (c) all reactions in the group
are considered valuable countertransference
responses to the case material; and (d) group-as-a-whole
phenomenon exist and are a crucial
part of the process. The supervision group
"will unself-consciously, and probably unconsciously,
begin functioning as a holding environment
for the unaware feelings, thoughts, and
experiences the therapist is experiencing with
the patient, but with regard to which he (or she)
has not yet achieved understanding" (Altfeld &amp;
Bernard, 1997, p. 386).


Rosenthal's (1999) model, which is based on
multiple-level interactions and parallel process,
suggested that the major aspects of group
supervision include (a) resolution of countertransference
resistance; (b) demonstration of
group leader interventions (i.e., setting the
climate, contracting, integrating new members,
preserving the integrity of the group as a learning
modality, and managing and resolving the
whole variety of resistances that inevitably
emerge); and (c) discussion of the parallel process
to illustrate resistance, transference, and countertransference
to facilitate effective interventions.


Rosenthal's (1999) model focused specifically
on resistance. She defines <i>resistance</i> as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
The very same measures patients used in the face
of psychological exigency in order to maintain
psychological equilibrium in their very first
groups, their families. Resistance is seen as serving
a vital function of communicating life history
and is therefore elicited and welcomed. . . .
Attempts to forcibly wrest resistance from
patients cause them to cling to the resistance even
more desperately and also raise the danger of
forcing the patient to use even more primitive
defenses, (p. 201)
</p>
</blockquote>


The very same measures patients used in the face

and is therefore elicited and welcomed. . . .
Attempts to forcibly wrest resistance from
patients cause them to cling to the resistance even
more desperately and also raise the danger of
forcing the patient to use even more primitive
defenses, (p. 201)


Her interventions to deal with resistance
include modeling support and joining with
nondestructive resistance, such as restricting
presentations to successful sessions or interventions,
competitiveness with the supervisor, and
argumentativeness with fellow members, a task
she views as essential.

[p. <i>146</i>]

The divergently genuine feeling responses of the
other members tend to offer the specific emotional
experience [that] is needed to meet previously
unmet developmental needs. This collective feedback
plays a more significant role in the working
through process than the explanations offered by
the therapist. (Rosenthal, 1999, p. 210)


Most of the models suggested for group supervision
of group leaders have been based on theory
and clinical experience. Many of the writings
include case examples of group supervision.
However, almost no research has been done to
date to test the effectiveness of models of supervision.
Riester (1991), in one of the few evaluation
studies of group supervision, focused on
group leaders of inpatient children's groups.
Riester reported that cohesiveness, trust, and
supervision group size were the most important
factors influencing communication, followed by
the desire for both experiential and didactic materials,
the importance of clearly stated goals and
expectations initially, and the importance of the
supervisor as a model. Hunter and Armstrong
(1994) examined the efficacy of a group supervision
seminar focused on discussion of group
processes, the development of cotherapy relationships,
and the training of beginning group leaders.
Overall, group leaders in the group supervision
seminar reported that the seminar leaders, the
group, and the choice of readings were helpful.
These studies used small selected samples and
self-report questionnaires or interviews. Thus, it
is essential that more research be conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of group supervision in
general and the comparative efficacy of different
models of group supervision of group leaders.


SUGGESTIONS FOR BEST PRACTICES FOR
THE SUPERVISION OF GROUP LEADERSHIP


In this section, the most clinically relevant suggestions
for best practices for the supervision of
group leaders that have emerged from the
literature review are presented. The section is
organized to reflect the three primary topics
reviewed above: importance and ingredients of
successful supervision of group leaders, critical
themes in the supervision of group leaders, and
models for supervising group leaders.


Critical Themes in the
Supervision of Group Leaders


Supervisors of group leaders can help their
trainees prevent, identify, and successfully
manage their anxiety, parallel process, and
countertransference (Corey &amp; Corey, 2002;
Gladding, 1999; Hayes, 1995). The key to preventing
these events from affecting leadership
negatively seems to be to increase awareness of
the leaders' personal feelings and reactions in
group and supervision (Corey &amp; Corey, 2002;
Hayes, 1995; Yalom, 1995). Thus, supervisors
of group leaders need to be empathically
attuned to their trainees' personal and emotional
experiences in group, which are likely to be
quite prevalent and intense, instead of just their
technical skills (Murphy et al., 1996). Ideally,
supervisors should strive to establish a positive
supervisory alliance early in the supervision
process; indeed, most trainees will explore such
sensitive topics only within an extremely safe
and supportive supervisory context (Kleinberg,
1999; Murphy et al., 1996; Yalom, 1995).


Group supervisors of group leaders can help
identify trainees' anxiety, parallel process, and
countertransference reactions by attending to
trainees' affective, behavioral, and cognitive
reactions in their group and supervisory sessions
(DeLucia et al., 1989; DeLucia-Waack, 1999;
Halperin, 1989). Supervisors can use live observation,
audiotapes, or videotapes to assess group
therapist-trainees' behavior in group, while
process notes and discussion in supervision can
help identify trainees' emotional and cognitive
reactions to group (Fauth &amp; Hayes, 2002;
Halperin, 1989). For example, group leaders
who exhibit excessively positive reactions
toward members) of their group (e.g., excitement,
happiness) might be in danger of becoming
enmeshed with the group, whereas group
leaders who experience overly negative reactions
might withdraw or become overly critical
toward group members (Fauth &amp; Hayes, 2002).


Supervisors also should be alert to their own
reactions that are stimulated in the supervisory
sessions (DeLucia et al., 1989; Yalom, 1995).
DeLucia et al. noted that parallel process in
group supervision includes reenactment of the
group counseling relationship within supervision
(or vice versa) and focusing on impasses,

[p. <i>147</i>]

Group leaders can then use their realistic
reactions in crafting effective group interventions
(e.g., interpersonal feedback). However,
interventions emanating from anxiety or countertransference
are likely to be countertherapeutic
in nature (Yalom, 1995). At times, simple
exploration and self-reflection in supervision
will clarify the intent of the intervention. When
exploration fails to illuminate the intent, however,
the primary means for separating real from
unreal reactions is consensual validation, which
is available from up to four sources: supervisor,
peers (when supervision is conducted in a group
format), cotherapists (when group is conducted
in a cotherapy format), and group members. For
instance, a group leader who is feeling frustrated
and critical toward a group member might
elicit reactions from his or her cotherapist,
supervisor, and other group members. When
others share similar reactions, the reaction is
more likely based in reality (and can be used
to give interpersonal feedback to that member).
However, when others' reactions are dissimilar,
the reaction is more likely based in the group
leader's anxiety, countertransference, or parallel
process.


Types of Supervision
for Group Leadership


Several suggestions for best practices in the
supervision of group leaders can be made on the
basis of this review of the literature. First,
supervision is essential to effective group leadership.
Second, skill development; the relationship
between group leaders, group members,
and supervisor; and personal reactions must
all be topics of supervision. Third, different
modalities of supervision provide different
benefits and emphases for group leaders.


Yalom (1985) reported the importance of
supervision for group leaders in continuing to
increase their repertoire of effective group interventions
and to prevent them from getting stuck
in a cycle of ineffective inventions. Each model
of supervision reviewed previously suggested
the importance of evaluating group leader interventions
in terms of their effectiveness for individual
members and the group as a whole, and
then based on these evaluations, planning for
future group sessions. All models emphasized
the importance of the development of trust in
the supervisory relationship not only between the
supervisor and the group leader(s) but also
between coleaders. This trust is needed to facilitate
honest feedback and a collaborative working
relationship.


While many of the models of supervision, particularly
those based on psychodynamic theory,
emphasize the necessity of analyzing parallel
process and countertransference, most also emphasize
the need for discussion of specific skills
interventions and application of group theory.
Beginning group leaders need help developing
certain skills, specifically confrontation, here-and-now
interventions, and relating group events
to individual group members' goals. They also
need help in moving beyond their initial stage
of providing individual therapy within a group
context. Thus, supervision must focus on skill
development and also personal reactions that
may be affecting group facilitation skills.


Different modalities of supervision have
also been postulated to have different advantages.
A coleadership model in which an inexperienced
group leader coleads with a more
experienced group leader provides the advantages
of the shared group experience and the
apprentice being able to experientially observe
and learn from the coleader. A triadic model of
supervision in which a supervisor supervises a
coleadership team has the advantage of objectively
being able to intervene in the coleader
relationship as well as providing a different
perspective on group events. Group supervision
of group leaders provides the opportunity to
experience group process, observe models of
group leadership, and receive feedback from
multiple perspectives.

[p. <i>148</i>]

CONCLUSION


Supervision is critical to enhancing the effectiveness
of group leader training and counseling practice.
Although research on the supervision of group
leaders is still preliminary, it does suggest that
supervision is important. Furthermore, due to
the complexity of group leadership, leader anxiety,
countertransference, and parallel process
will occur frequently and are essential to consider
in supervision. Numerous models of
supervision have been developed reflecting the
various potential modalities (e.g., individual,
coleader, and group), with different formats,
foci, and interventions suggested. More research
is needed, both quantitative and qualitative, that
assesses the effectiveness of group supervision
of group leaders in general, the efficacy of
specific models of supervision, and critical
interventions within supervision groups.
