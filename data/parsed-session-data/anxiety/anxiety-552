<b>DR:</b> How was your break?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> What did you all do?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, pretty much kind of stayed around because dad couldn't really go out much.
<b>DR:</b> Is he home now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because they were up at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And did that -
<b>PT:</b> We came home I think it was the day before Christmas and that, so we yeah we've been pretty much staying home every since, so.
<b>DR:</b> You, oh, you didn't go up there.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think like my aunt and uncle, uh, drove me up there I think the last week of school that I had.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then, uh, we, me and my little brother stayed up there with them at the apartments for I think maybe 3 days.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Then we were able to come back.  Then, uh -
<b>DR:</b> How is he?
<b>PT:</b> He's doing pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Not too sick?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> I know that's pretty tough because he got chemo.  They're doing chemo?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Any radiation or?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think he had any radiation.
<b>DR:</b> Did you get your grades before you took off, uh, on your break?
<b>PT:</b> Um, uh, I think they, I can't remember [INAUDIBLE].  I, I think, I don't know if I got them.  I think they like might have mailed them or something or like e-mailed them.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because, uh, I think my mom had them and -
<b>DR:</b> How'd they look?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, they were pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Did they.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Very good.  How are you doing with your retention and concentration and -
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Any, uh, distractibility or?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> It's been better?  Organization and?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Doing okay?  And you tell me about your worry,  I know that's always an issue.
<b>PT:</b> Um, right now the biggest thing is just kind of getting everybody home and just kind of like getting back to, trying to get to normal as much as possible.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Trying to stay at my uncle's house while my parents are up in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> You hated that.  Yeah. [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Why was it so bad?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know.  I, I, I just get a little bit of anxiety when I'm away from home.  U, usually it's not that bad but just seeing like, he was in the hospital a lot up there.  It was just, just, just a little anxiety but other than that I mean everything else is just fine.
<b>DR:</b> Then you're, it's always an understatement with you.  A little anxiety.  A little anxiety for you would be how much for everybody else?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, well just kind of, kind, kind of worried.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just um, uh, lost a little bit of my appetite a little bit.  Um, it, it didn't really, it didn't to me anyway I was, I was still doing fine at school.  It didn't really hinder me in a whole lot of ways but, um, but I just kind of, well I wasn't really feeling kind of tip-top like I usually am but not, not, not too bad.
<b>DR:</b> Lost your appetite too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you get kind of depressed?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And since you're back home you're a little better?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I mean, I, I, I'm fine now.
<b>DR:</b> I see your dad's not with you today what's he doing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, he's probably sleeping at home.  He's, he's, he's getting better but still after all that chemo he still he gets kind of tired easily and he's just still not back up to, um, he, he can go out in a crowd now.  They don't have to worry about like him catching, really catching anything.  If he catches something we, we still really need to kind of watch him but it won't, won't be that bad but for now the best thing the doctor said was just kind of like stay at home, get as much rest as possible.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And not so kind of go out as much.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but um, he, he, he's been doing pretty good.  He's, um, he's like walking around the house.  He's building stamina back up.  Um, he's getting, I think he's getting a lot of his appetite back because I think after like all that chemo I mean  he didn't want to eat anything.
<b>DR:</b> Lost a lot of weight?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Um, but he, he, he's getting a lot better.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  How's your brother holding up?
<b>PT:</b> Um, that, that was my, that was my second, that was my second thing.  Um, it's usually only, all, only those 2 things.  My dad's getting better so that's, that's almost out of the way hopefully.  But, um, my little, little brother, um, ever since we've been on this break, he, he, he seems fine.  He, he, he's relaxed.  He's, he's, he's, uh, I mean he's fine when we're on break but, um, when, whenever uh, whenever like school gets back in, he, he always seems a little bit more agitated and just a little quicker to, he's snap at you and stuff and, um, just a little bit more annoying than he usually is.  Um, I, I know he's not doing too well with his grades and stuff.  Um, but he, he, he just, he seemed a lot more relaxed when, I, I, I know it's, I don't know what's really go on in school but, um, with, um, whenever we're going to, from school I mean, um, he just seems a lot more stressed out during -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> The school weeks than on like a normally, I mean I guess I am a little too but for him it's, it's really noticeable.  Um, he, he gets really agitated.  Um, uh, kind of has a shorter temper.  Um, uh, and then, I, I can tell just he, he, he does not like going to school at all.  Um, it, uh, my, my parents, I, I, I was thinking about this.  My parents sent him to a [DEIDENTIFIED] because of his math grades because he was doing pretty bad and, um, he actually did fairly well there.  So, um, and I, I kind of know what he's going through because him and me, I mean he'd never say this out loud.  I mean we're kind of, we're very similar in a lot of ways.  We, we kind of think the same way.  Um, a lot of our opinions, um, are fairly similar.  I mean we still disagree on a lot of stuff.  But, um, I think this whole, like, school thing is, because I think I kind of know what he's going through because, um, I think if I wouldn't have been able to get to [DEIDENTIFIED], I'd probably, like in a sub situation kind of like where he is now really kind of like struggling and stuff, but, um, yeah, he's, he's, he's been fine these last few weeks but that probably, that when he gets home now probably be like really worn out, tired.  Um, just, just kind of, I mean he, he, he really sleeps a lot more when they're, when the school week's in because like on the um, on the vacation I mean he'd, he'd be up like, like 7:00 in the morning doing stuff.  And, um, he'd go to bed really, really late because he'd be like have, doing stuff but, um, now, now it's like, um, as son as he gets home he, he likes sleeps on the way home.  Uh, he like, like flops down on the couch and like takes a nap whenever we get home.  Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Does he talk to you much about your dad?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not, not really.  Um, we, we do talk about it sometimes.  But, um, I'm not sure if that's really what's bothering him because, um, I'm around him a lot more than my parents are.  Um, he, he, he usually kind of keeps to himself a lot.  He doesn't like, he doesn't like to really open up about a whole lot of stuff.  Um, but he, he kind of opens up with me a lot more than my parents because I guess I don't know if it's like we're kind of similar in the same age or something but, um, I, I get the feeling that it's, it's really just has a lot to do with just him not liking the school that he's in.  Um, it's, it's getting to the point where, well it's getting a lot similar to where his, like, his old school was, where he was in his old school because he used to go to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Back, I think he had this same problem.  I think he's just, I think he's just like feeling overwhelmed because all this stuff.  So I think to like take the stress of he, like, then skips assignments.  He like doesn't do like certain homework things.  Um, but I, I can tell he's, he's really just worn out and overwhelmed during that school week and -
<b>DR:</b> So he did this years ago.  It's not really similar to about the school and the work as it is -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, when he was going to [DEIDENTIFIED] he had, I noticed he was having these same issues with like the tiredness and the agitatedness but, um, I think at first when he went to [DEIDENTIFIED] he was doing fairly well.  Um, I think that, that just the optimism of okay I'm going to do better because this is a brand new -
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Clean slate with -
<b>DR:</b> This is his what year there?  How many years has he been there?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know maybe this is his 4th year there.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I know it had been a while.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it, it has been a while but, um, I think it was just that, that clean slate.  Okay, it's a brand new year and he, he, he was doing fairly well.  But I think that the next year at, his grades started to drop just a little bit.  I could tell he was getting just a little more -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Overwhelmed and last year it was getting really bad.  This year it's even worse and I, I can tell.  I mean and he, he, he's trying.  I can tell he's trying.  He, um, he doesn't like that, he hates failing, that he's failing some classes and, um -
<b>DR:</b> It's not like him?
<b>PT:</b> It, it, I mean, he's, he's, he's not one to slack off and not do his work.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I, I know he, he really tries to get stuff done but he, he just seems like really, really overwhelmed and stuff.  And I mean I'm not getting this from, I mean he usually doesn't tell me this I can just kind of pick it up from the way he is around the house and stuff.  Um, and this is like a lot of the way I was whenever I get like frustrated or overwhelmed I, I, I act the same way and um, but yeah just and I know it's just killing my parents because I mean they, they don't want him to fail and they, of course my, my dad is, um, my dad is like probably one of the most stubborn people I've met and, um, he means well but I, I think he's, he's, he's really hard on [NAME OTHER] about the whole grades thing because I, I don't know if it's just he doesn't really, my dad's kind of like one of those people who really think okay you can just try, try, try and push.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Blow through this, come on just go.  You can do it.  Come on, come on, come on.
<b>DR:</b> It, it is a [INAUDIBLE] towards his cancer.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and that probably, that's what he got, gets, what got him through the whole thing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just mean to keep going and going.  But [NAME OTHER]'s not, isn't part of the way the same way he is, um, and neither am I cause I mean sometimes I get a little frustrated with him because he's just, um, one of the guys who well this doesn't mean anything.  You can do it, just go and, um, a lot of times he's right and, um, he's helped me through a lot of stuff by doing that just saying come on, come on, come on.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But um, I think that [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER]'s trying but it's getting well to the point where [NAME OTHER], I think [NAME OTHER] trying as hard as he can and it's, it's just not working.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That, that, that school's just not working for him.
<b>DR:</b> Like you said, maybe he just needs some, uh, additional help just like your dad can be real determined to get to the cancer but he needs some help.  You know he still needs to go to the doctors and his [INAUDIBLE] and he needs the support of his family and needs a lot of help.  He can't do it on his own.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and, um, I was, I was actually talking to my mom on the way here about [NAME OTHER] and about, um, how good he did at [DEIDENTIFIED] because the people there are kind of like the people at [DEIDENTIFIED].  They, they, they'll keep working with you until you get it but at [DEIDENTIFIED], I mean and I, I understand this because I mean they, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s a fairly big school.  They can't just like hold up the rest of the class because of 1 student.  They kind of have to keep moving and, um, [NAME OTHER] gets kind of left behind a lot of times because I mean he did, if he doesn't understand the material at like this part.  He's not going to understand the material that's farther on.
<b>DR:</b> Did you talk to [NAME OTHER] about this?
<b>PT:</b> Not, not, a, a little bit but he, he, he, he really doesn't like to talk about it.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  He'd be kind of negative on that idea I would imagine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I mean he, he, he doesn't like to admit he's getting left behind but, um, I, I know he is so I, I, I've been talking to my mom like maybe he should like go to [DEIDENTIFIED] because I mean it worked great for me and I know I, I'd probably been in a similar situation with him if I hadn't gone to [DEIDENTIFIED], if the teachers wouldn't have helped me out a lot but, um -
<b>DR:</b> You know you sound, uh, like your kind of stepping up and taking over some of dad's duties.
<b>PT:</b> A little bit because, um, they, they've, since they've been away for long it's just kind of me and [NAME OTHER].  I mean because we've been staying at my aunt and uncles but, um -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess I've noticed a lot more since it's just me and [NAME OTHER] -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Now.  So, yeah I guess I have been a little, just kind of taking over a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Um, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  You just have to recognize it.  You know you've got a new year coming next year too.  It's going to be hugely different for  you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> A lot of changes in your family and you're letting yourself and that's not easy.  It isn't for somebody who doesn't like change.  And let's just keep them like they are.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You'll have your attention and concentration and you've been getting your work done and pretty organized and your moods decent.  But you are eating better now?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Glad you recognize that you weren't.  Did you lose much weight?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Like how much?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I haven't checked my weight in a while but, um, it, it was kind of weird whenever, whenever I was at school it wasn't bad so I guess just like kind of like the busyness kind of took my mind off it a little bit but, um, I could tell I was just a, a little bit more, a little bit more stressed out.  Um, and usually I'm not that stressed out at school.  I like, I love, I like, I love going to school which is, a lot of other kids can't say that but, um, it's, I , I don't like dread going to school saying, "Ah I got to do work today.  I got to like do like 50 billion problems and stuff."  But, um, it just seemed like just the little things maybe the teachers are, like, don't give homework a lot there.  But, um, I, I was feeling just a little bit kind of overcome by a lot of the stuff, um, a little bit, uh, slower in just kind of like the thinking and stuff.  I, I was distracted a lot more than I usually am.  Um, but now that every, everybody just kind of getting back to normal I, I'm fine.  But it was just that during that period I was just kind of a little bit, I, I really wasn't that much more agitated but just kind of tired, tired more.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I, um, noticed that I was a lot more tired and I'd go to sleep a lot faster than I usually do and have like a harder time getting up in the mornings.  But, um, yeah ever since we've got home it's been fine.
<b>DR:</b> Your dad going to be home for a while?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When does he have to go back for more treatments?
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Haven't heard?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think he has to go back to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a while.  He's, um, he has to go to, um, [DEIDENTIFIED] which is in [DEIDENTIFIED] -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Like every few weeks to kind of check up on him but other than that I don't think there's a, he has to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] for -
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> For just a little while at least.
<b>DR:</b> All right, let's go get your mom and see what she's got to say to you, okay?  You've got school today, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> First day back.  Do they give you work to do over your break?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.
