BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how is your depression?  How are your mood swings?
<b>PT:</b> They're okay.  
<b>DR:</b> Earlier you were telling me something? 
<b>PT:</b> My mood swings they vary because I'm like - because I think I'm getting no sleep. 
<b>DR:</b> You're not sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> No, I would say I'm up 'til 2:00 before I even get drowsy.  
<b>DR:</b> Do you take any naps during the daytime?
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> So even with one Ambien CR you don't sleep much?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I go to sleep - I take the pill and I go to sleep, but then I wake up.  
<b>DR:</b> Hmm.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm not getting a full night's sleep. 
<b>DR:</b> Are you worried about something?  You go to sleep with something on your mind or?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I usually do.  
<b>DR:</b> Like what?  What's going on?
<b>PT:</b> I worry about my daughter and my son.  My son just got married. 
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>PT:</b> And I don't think - I just think it's going to last. 
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> It just, it was a train wreck before it even started. 
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> It was a train wreck before it even started.  I hope you know, I hope they make it, but... 
<b>DR:</b> How long have they been married?
<b>PT:</b> They've been married now about three weeks.  
<b>DR:</b> Oh. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh and since the three weeks he has wanted to move back in about three times. 
<b>DR:</b> With you?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  He talks to his dad.  He won't talk to me about it.  He talks to his dad and he tells him yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So that worries, does that probably stops you from sleeping? 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  
<b>DR:</b> What else?
<b>PT:</b> Well, like I said, I worry about my daughter, she's down in [DEIDENTIFIED] by herself
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh 
<b>PT:</b> With her three children and, sometimes we have to help her financially and this is not a burden, but having to help her financially worries me.  I asked her once would she come home, back to [DEIDENTIFIED] and she's making more money there, but we have no family there and if something happens, you know, there's no way for anyone to contact us.  
<b>DR:</b> If she's making more money, she's not managing it well?  What's going on there? 
<b>PT:</b> Well, she is, but like I said she has three children and she, well she just paid off her car, which helps her get two hundred dollars a month added to her money, but, you know her having to sometimes call us, it worries me.  She has car trouble sometimes and we live two hours away from her and I laugh at her and I told her what your dad going to do, run down there, because she always calls when she has car trouble and he makes suggestions to her what to do and she has found a mechanic that's really good.  
<b>DR:</b> Now your husband's drinking is now under control.  
<b>PT:</b> He even stopped smoking.  
<b>DR:</b> That things are good because a year ago, remember you were so - 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh 
<b>DR:</b> And we had to see you so regularly because of that, but not since June and he seems to be supportive, that makes a difference. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> But are you taking your medication?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am. 
<b>DR:</b> Just the way it's prescribed. You get Neurontin, correct?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Neurontin, Trileptal, Xanax? 
<b>PT:</b> I'm not taking Trileptal.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  That's right.  We had stopped that. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> For your mood swings we are just narrowed down to Neurontin, Xanax and Wellbutrin. 
<b>PT:</b> Yes. 
<b>DR:</b> Trileptal we stopped about what eight weeks ago, was it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Remember? No problem with that?
<b>PT:</b> No.  
<b>DR:</b> And how about your memory problem, how are they doing?  Because we had to CAT scan and everything, but that seems to be improving some?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  
<b>DR:</b> I think that was probably, you were overly medicated probably. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> When we had to CAT scan, you were so confused.  
<b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER], my husband he won't let me drive and he wanted to [DEIDENTIFIED] like from here to the parking lot, he won't even let me drive that far and, I consider myself a good driver, but he worries that something may happen.  
<b>DR:</b> Because you remember eight weeks ago you were... 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and shakes and he worries because I had those shakes. 
<b>DR:</b> Shakes from the anxiety.  That was strictly from medication. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> It had nothing to do with - I mean you were having a side effect.  That's when we took you off of Trileptal I remember now.  
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. 
<b>DR:</b> And that seems to be doing good.  So at least the mood swings are like leveled out?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> Except for the sleep and I think that has a lot to do with what's going on with your children and what you worry about you know. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think so. 
<b>DR:</b> Because you did very well when I had you on Ambien before too.  I mean, you slept pretty good then.  Do you practice a good sleep hygiene?  Like you know how we have to do go to bed at the same time, try not to take anything caffeinated after 4:00, take a warm bath that helps, you know?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> Wake up at the same time.  Those are some simple things that you do for your sleep, that's called sleep hygiene. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> I may - I have a pamphlet, I'll give you that and you try to follow that and I understand your children and you worry about them, but you know, your son was he living with you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he was. 
<b>DR:</b> What kind of work he does?
<b>PT:</b> He, I don't know what he does, but he works at a place at [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>DR:</b> And his wife works?  She's very young, isn't she? 
<b>PT:</b> Uh, he's [AGE] and I think she's like around [AGE] or something like that. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, I thought she was very young, maybe I made a mistake.  She works or no?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, she works. 
<b>DR:</b> So what's going on that they cannot get along?  What's going on?  Do you know? 
<b>PT:</b> I think he said she drinks because he told me one time when he wanted to come home that on the weekend, she and her cousin, get together and drink
<b>DR:</b> And your son doesn't drink?
<b>PT:</b> He drinks, he drinks beer, but that's like every now and then. 
<b>DR:</b> It's not a problem and she goes beyond. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  She gets to the point where she doesn't get drunk and she has two children and he has two children.  But his two stay with their parents, the mother, but he gets along with her children.  They like him.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, they just got married so they have to go through that, you know. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Yucky adjustment.  I mean, marriage in the beginning, you know.  My suggestion to you is tell your husband if he finds out anything about your children, try not to know, but you can't help it can you?
<b>PT:</b> No because when he calls, when my son calls, they go outside a lot and talk and I said, I asked him, [NAME OTHER] call?  That's his name [NAME OTHER] and, um, he said yeah he called, I said what'd he want.  I always know he want something and when they go outside I definitely know something's up and if he don't tell me he know it's gonna worry me so he tells me, but my daughter, I know when something's up with her too.  She calls and she says is dad home and I says yeah and she said let me speak to him and I said what's wrong.  That's what I say, what's wrong and she'll tell me something may be wrong with her car or something, you know, she needs a little extra money this month and, so I know, you know, she's got problems.  He can't keep it away from me, I always know.  
<b>DR:</b> But that doesn't help because then you go to sleep worried about it.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  
<b>DR:</b> But then if you didn't find out you would, wouldn't know [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.  
<b>DR:</b> Darned if you do and darned if you don't.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> [PATIENT NAME] what we going to do? Now, you have Xanax, you've been taking how many?  Three and a half, right?
<b>PT:</b> Four.  I take four a day.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, because remember last time we talked, we were going to cut back on it, but you are taking four.  I was going to tell you to go up on it, I thought we talked about going down, but some days you did take three and a half last time you told me, remember, Xanax?  
<b>PT:</b> I have never taken three and a half.  I've always taken four a day. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I thought last time we talked and you said yes, we will try three and a half.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we did. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it didn't work out. 
<b>PT:</b> No. 
<b>DR:</b> What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go up on your Xanax, this prescription, because I cannot change your husband or I cannot change you to say try not to know about your children they're grown and they want help, I mean you dealt with your problems on your own, these are growing pains.  People have to handle what they have to handle.  You understand?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> But I know everybody's not the same so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go up on your Xanax and I'm gonna give you 2 mg. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> And still take four times a day, but if it makes you too groggy during the daytime then just take half a tablet.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> But right before you go, what time do you take your Ambien?
<b>PT:</b> Right before I go to bed, but I don't get sleepy until about 2:00 and see if I'm not sleeping, and I go lay down, I just lay there and worry and then I get a headache.  
<b>DR:</b> But why don't you do this then. Take 2 mg Xanax that I'm giving you today
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. 
<b>DR:</b> Say around 9:00-9:30 at night? 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, there's no way I could go to bed that early. 
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no. Just take it, it's not gonna make you sleepy. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Just take that, it will keep you, you know, hopefully it won't make you as anxious.  
<b>PT:</b> And that's what?
<b>DR:</b> Xanax, Xanax I'm talking about. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Because I'm going up on it 2 mg and then take your Ambien say around an hour after you take Xanax, around 10:00 or 11:00, would that be feasible? 
<b>PT:</b> Well, the Ambien says, you know, I watch the commercials on TV and it says when you take it you automatically get sleepy.
<b>DR:</b> Yes. 
<b>PT:</b> And then there's a part of the pill that makes you sleepy and then a part of the pill that keeps you asleep. 
<b>DR:</b> Right, uh-huh.  
<b>PT:</b> But that's not the way it is. 
<b>DR:</b> I know, medication can do only some, that's why I think one of the things and before you have done well on Ambien and slept good and we were able to control and cut back so much of your medication.  You know, all this, remember?  You were having side effects on Risperdal, and Seroquel and all of these we have to cut back, and all you're totally off of it, Depakote and everything. So what I want to do is, let's just see, we'll go up on your Xanax, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> This prescription only I just want to see because sleep is very important and once you don't sleep it can lead into more and more problems, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So, and especially with your bipolar sleep is very important.  You don't have any racing of thoughts or anything, do you?
<b>PT:</b> Any what?
<b>DR:</b> Any racing of thoughts?  Or continuously worried about or thinking about one thing to the next thing to the next thing? 
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes. 
<b>DR:</b> How bad it is?
<b>PT:</b> It's not as bad as it used to be, but I would say I worry constantly everyday.  
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Okay.  All right, so let me try this then.  Let's just go with Xanax, you come back, you still want to come back in four weeks?  If you have any problems, come back in two weeks, otherwise let's just try this, give me a call, if you still cannot sleep, you just call me and maybe I'll have to make some changes in the form with your medications.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So we'll do Xanax an hour or so before you are ready to take your Ambien, okay? 
<b>PT:</b> I can't take two Ambien? 
<b>DR:</b> I rather you don't. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  I mean you are on slow-release and I don't like to give - let's try the Xanax to see if it can make you calm because, see one of the things is you go to bed with so many things on your mind worried, so maybe Xanax will cut back some of the worry I'm hoping and then the Ambien probably will kick in.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> So you take a Xanax an hour before you take your Ambien.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay?  All right.  We'll see you [PATIENT NAME]  in four weeks.  I'm going to write you a prescription, okay? 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
