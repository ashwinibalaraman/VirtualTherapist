<font size="5"><b>FUCK DR. SEARS, OR THE FALLACT OF DESIGNER PARENTING</b></font>
[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>"I'M KNOCKED UP,"</b> I intoned into the phone to my mother, waving
my pee stick with the two pink lines.


"Now everyone will be telling you what to do. Including me," she
said. "Don't listen." With that, she handed the phone to my father.


Of course she was right. Everyone had opinions about my gestation
and our plans for raising a sprout.


"Do what you want, just don't homeschool," said my father,
who was pretty opinionated about maternity for a hay farmer. "And
nurse for six months. That's plenty."


"What is the baby? A girl, right?" asked a coworker when I was
perhaps eight weeks pregnant, as if we could tell. As if the embryo
was sexually differentiated.


"What's your theme? You gotta have a theme," declared one of
Jim's colleagues, an oft-repeated question we finally began answering
sarcastically: <i>We're going with an authentic biker-bar motif. We're
seasoning the walls with Vantage 100s to give them a rich tobacco patina,
and we're going to scatter muddy sawdust around the concrete floor. The
baby will sleep on a splintery picnic table or pass out in the corner</i>.


"That's going to be twins!" announced a guy at the grocery

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You're gonna need the epidural," said the checker at Home
Depot who was ringing up my new faucet.


All men. All opinionated. None of them the primary caregiver
for a child. Sound familiar?


We got our first book from the "experts" on loan from some
friends. It was William Sears's <i>The Baby Book</i>. I liked it. It seemed to
validate what I suspected, despite my increasing anxiety and paranoia:
I was properly invested with all the emotional and physical
tools necessary to raise a happy, healthy child. I should trust my
instincts and do what felt natural. Tasteful, pleasant line drawings
depicted a smiling mother with a neat bob nursing, fastening her
sling, playing with cylindrical foam bolster pillows, and otherwise
assisting her babbling, secure infant on its journey through life.
How reassuring! We would be attachment parents. We spouted
Sears-isms in birthing class, scanning the faces of the other couples
for signs of recognition. We brought our copy with us to the hospital,
where the lactation consultant swooned over it. All was good.
Except for one thing.


"That Dr. Sears is a kook," my mother proclaimed.


"No, you're thinking of Barry Sears, the diet guy," I corrected.


"I know who I mean."


Having been given dispensation to ignore her, I chose to. Soon
the baby began vomiting great torrents of half-digested breast milk.


"Uh oh, it's not supposed to be projectile," I told Jim.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Why is that bad?"


"I don't know, but look at this list—that's bad."


The baby began screaming and twisting up like a fortunetelling
fish after every feeding.


"No, he's supposed to drift off peacefully at the breast." I pointed
to the picture.


"That's not peaceful."


"I know."


We tried the colic maneuvers. We bicycled legs. We swung the
baby around on our forearms. Nothing seemed to help. Worse, it
was happening all day.


Finally I devised a baby-joggling maneuver based on Dr. Sears's
advice to move the baby in more than one plane (say, bounce up and
down and forward and backward at the same time). I would joggle
the baby while moving my arms from side to side, gently tapping
his butt in time to music—not like a spanking, just like a mullet-
headed guy keeping time on his girlfriend's thigh while rocking out:
to Laser Floyd. This would quiet the baby and eventually induce
sleep, especially if we put on industrial music or the "nuclear polka"
of Brave Combo.


That was the good news about Dr. Sears. He reaffirmed our
instincts when all the other "experts" were touting nursing schedules
and crib training. Our kid was a screamer. He didn't sleep in
his bassinet, and I didn't sleep in my bed. We slept together in a
recliner, clinging to each other. Or else Jim would arrange five
pillows into a pyramidal shape and prop the baby on his chest while
I passed out on the couch for a few hours.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I wore the baby all day. I had slings and pouches and carriers.
Striped ones. Floral ones. Black ones. Red tartan plaid ones. Ones
with rings and ones with snaps and ones with buckles. Some had
padding. Some did not. Outside the carrier, the baby would assume
a pickle-sucking grimace and wail monotonously—including at
night. Other people's babies rode around in travel systems and
strollers; they lounged adorably on kitty blankets, nibbling on their
toes. Mine was strapped to my chest like a suicide bomb for the first
eight months. Well-intentioned acquaintances waggled their fingers
invitingly, but when I unbuckled Baldo and handed him over,
they would recoil from his squalling. Their bouncing methods and
goofy faces proved futile.


According to Dr. Sears, this constant baby-wearing was not only
benign—it was desirable, promoting bonding, facilitating cognitive
development, and helping the baby and mother feel secure. It was
all good.


But one statement stuck in my craw.


Babywearing also prevents depression because a baby who
is worn fusses less, so the mother feels more confident, less
strained, and therefore less depressed. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6334');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6334" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">17. Sears, William, <i>The Baby Book</i> (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1993).</div>


Dr. Sears goes on to state, "The goodness of a baby is not a measure
of your effectiveness as a mother," but we've already stopped
listening. We're back at "prevents depression."


The message of the attachment-parenting philosophy is clear:
A satisfied baby doesn't cry. And a mother of an attached baby isn't
depressed. Both statements are bullshit.

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet mothers cling to them—as I did, initially—with almost religious
fervor. All my friends, online and in real life, were Sears acolytes,
and attachment parenting was working beautifully for them.
Everyone got loads of sleep in the family bed, and their babies and
toddlers were bright, inquisitive, roly-poly, and clear skinned. Their
children did not vomit and scream.


And their babies <i>never cried</i>. One mother became indignant that
babies were always said to cry in books and songs. Why, hers never
did! What reason would a baby have to cry, unless he was strapped
into an infant seat and ignored by his mother? Babies cried when
they were abandoned in cribs and corked up with pacifiers. Haven't:
you read <i>The Continuum Concept?</i> Don't you know that among the
Yequana tribe, children <i>never</i> cry? You're abusive!


These parents, of course, have empathetic and sensitive children
whose every desirable characteristic is attributable to their having
been carried in a sling for the first year, and they think "colic" is
something that happens to horses.


I'd try to explain, acting out the tragedy of my son's gastrointestinal
system with my fingers and hands. I'd pantomime night-time
itching and topical steroid application with my hands while I
described my elimination diet. Still there'd be blank looks.


Desperate to get out of the house, I sweated through one
playgroup meeting, unable to stop the crying. We nursed,
rocked, bounced, checked diapers, changed diapers, chewed a
teether, sipped water, and nursed some more before finally giving
up after forty-five minutes of solid fussing. We carpooled home
with a mother and her four-year-old, who kept asking, "Why is

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"His tummy is hurt," I'd said. "It's broken." I was white-knuckled
at the wheel. I dropped them off at home and waved good-bye.
We didn't hear from them again.


At a pool party, I met a nice couple whose six-month-old had just
outgrown his colic. They still looked fearful, as if waiting for a sudden
breeze or a loud noise to send him into neurological overdrive.


I approached the mother, who was joggling back and forth with
the baby in a pouch-style sling while trying to talk to the host about
his postdoctoral fellowship.


"Ah," I observed. "The sling dance. I recall it well."


She looked at me as if I'd been reading her mail.


"Does your son have colic?" I asked. "Mine did, too—well,
reflux, actually."


"Really?" she asked. "What did you do?"


"Same thing you're doing now."


The mother sighed. "We went to Zilker Park," she explained,
"to get out one day. And you know what these people we met said
to us? ‘I guess we just never gave our kids a <i>reason</i> to cry.’ Can you
believe that?"


Actually I could. The people she met were the <i>winners</i>. They
got easy kids. They had, we assume, the financial and social wherewithal
to parent them gently—with a breast rather than a pacifier
or pumped milk, with a stay-at-home mother rather than a paid
caregiver, with in-arms loving. They got the bragging rights. They
got a return on their investment immediately. And they somehow
won the right to judge everyone else.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They were happy and sane. If we were good mothers, we would
be, too.


Nor is Dr. Sears's paternalistic advice about postpartum depression
particularly helpful. In none of the four pages devoted to it in
<i>The Baby Book</i> does he mention thoughts of suicide or self-harm, but
condescending language does count "lack of interest in grooming
and physical attractiveness, and a negative attitude toward husband"
among the hallmarks of PPD. Sears's advice almost entirely comprises
self-care measures that sound like a health brochure from the
1950s ("Practice good grooming" and "Stick to priorities" among
them, as if depressed people are capable of that). Expert therapy
merits a two-sentence mention; antidepressant medication, though
considered compatible with breastfeeding in many cases, is not
mentioned.


Nor is postpartum psychosis, a rare but serious and sudden-onset
illness that requires <i>immediate</i> medical intervention and usually
hospitalization, mentioned in the book. (Someone has since
included a cursory discussion of it on Sears's official website.) In
fact, Dr. Sears recommends a medical consultation only <i>after</i> the
self-care measures have been tried and discourages mothers from
receiving therapy that "would result in mother-baby separation."
Tellingly, he places this information (along with the toll-free number
for Depression After Delivery) in a section headlined "Tips for
Dads."


So the book reminded me to brush my hair, share the bed, and
"let baby be your therapist," but Dr. Sears didn't tell me what to
do when I stopped sleeping and started cutting my hands with the

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some of Sears's other advice to women is really tin-eared and
unsympathetic. (We'll leave aside the matter that "his" books largely
describe his <i>wife's</i> parenting techniques.) The asker of a hypothetical
question in the "Nighttime Parenting" chapter of <i>The Baby Book</i>
grouses that her two-year-old doesn't seem to nap, but "I need
a break." The doctor's response is, of course, to "nap with her."
"You probably look forward to her nap time so you can ‘finally get
something done.’ Resist this temptation," he advises. Yet sometimes
things <i>need</i> to get done—teeth brushed, mortgages paid, phone calls
returned. Never mind that a mother may be depressed. Maybe she,
a grown woman, just doesn't want to take a nap. I read this passage
and felt crushed. I'm not going to be able to get anything done for
<i>two years?</i> There seems to be no real awareness of the frustration
primary caregivers feel.


I've also seen far too many mothers beat themselves silly about using
pacifiers, swings, and other tools (what Dr. Sears calls "artificial
baby soothers" or "mechanical mothers") with their babies. When
I caught my mother trying to slip a Nuk into my screaming baby's
mouth, I tried to throw her out of the house. We had a fight, and I
fled to the parking lot of a liquor store, where I sat and cried and felt
like a big piece of shit—despised by my family, unable to comfort
my child, fighting the urge to drink kosher wine out of a bag.


Despite the occasional generic disclaimer ("Wherever all your

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The Fussy Baby Book</i> was closer to the mark but still off target.
I liked the dastardly looking cover baby. A tiny, wicked Damien,
lacking only a mustache to twirl and some cartoon TNT. Could the
Searses have a sense of humor after all?


Ours was a variant of fussiness: the <i>hurting</i> baby, who screams
due to unrelenting pain of a mysterious nature. We knew this, of
course. We did not know how to stop the pain. Dr. Sears recommended
an elimination diet, which we tried. Dr. Sears recommended
anti reflux medications, which we also tried. And of course Dr. Sears
recommended attachment parenting, which we had tried.


Worse, the parents quoted in <i>The Fussy Baby Book</i> were those

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Let's not bullshit ourselves, people. <i>Of course</i> you'd have it
another way if you could. It's not your child's job to teach you the
meaning of compassion. Your kid's job is to play and eat snacks and
grow up to be independent from you. Your child does not suffer in
order to build your character. If you could take all the reflux out of
your child's body and put it into yours, you would. So don't shine
me on about how you're thankful for your child's fussiness.


At the core of the Sears philosophy is the belief that children
should be held and nurtured and made to feel safe and comfortable
in the earliest stages of life so that they will not develop insecurities.
They will grow into confident and empathetic adults. Naturally, no
mother would disagree with this concept. Why, before Dr. Sears
came around and put his brand on it, this idea belonged to women
and was called <i>mothering</i>. Was Dr. Sears a necessary antidote to the
Spocks of the world, the advocates of playpens and scheduled feedings
and crying jags that "strengthened the lungs"? Quite possibly.
But wouldn't it have been nicer to just renounce this paternalistic
"expert" logic instead of replacing it with a kinder, gentler variety,
one that didn't carry a designer label, like "the Brazelton method"
or "a Sears baby"? (My child, for example, is very much an Ingman
baby.) One that didn't quietly endorse the old, tired concept of the
heroic, self-sacrificing mother?


One morning I took Baldo to a park one neighborhood over,

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do you know Linda?" one mother asked another. "Did you
meet her at La Leche League? Well, anyway, she's got it worse than
we do."


"Really?"


"If she moves at all, her five-year-old wakes up. And her three-year-old
wakes up at 1 AM and <i>stays up</i>."


A gasp of schadenfreude. <i>"Really?</i>"


"But fortunately, her mother lives in the same townhouse complex
and is really understanding."


We left quietly. Was this a parenting style or an inculcation of
female masochism, or both? Was someone going to win the Stella
Dallas Memorial Award for Greatest Maternal Sacrifice, Sleep-Loss
Division?


There's a certain type of parent I see often—sometimes I see
it in myself—who is a success-oriented person from a middle-class
background, well-taught (traditionally or through self-education)
and accustomed to high praise. We're used to getting a report card
or a performance review every six weeks, we're current with Big
Ideas and prone to Big Discussions over pints of Guinness, and we
throw ourselves into parenting with the same right-minded stamina
with which we might compare graduate programs and scholarships.

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is not necessarily lamentable. It's good to be well read,
to be prepared, to invest oneself in the new role of parent. It's just
not really about the <i>kids</i>, is it? It's about more than just wanting
to be good at what you do; it's about wanting to be <i>the best</i>. We're
parenting careerists. We want to be superstars. We want other people
to praise us. We want props for holding off on antibiotics for
that ear infection, for delaying solids just a little longer, for buying
the organic crib sheets and the shampoo that's made with kukui
nuts harvested by the indigenous people of Brazil and imported by
a woman-owned business. We go that one extra mile. We <i>exceed</i>
expectations. If we were an airline, we'd be Lufthansa.


Is this wrong? Again, not necessarily. It's not wrong to have
ambitions, to dream of home-sewn Halloween costumes (or ones
we just "whipped up" because we're so crafty) and slow food and
perfect portraits and cooperative preschool.


But we have to remember that our standards of success, of
happiness, of demonstrating our love for our children are inflated.
We'll never meet them. Our reach will always exceed our grasp.
Some days it's perfectly legitimate to feel proud that everyone is

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What the fuck does all this yuppie blather have to do with postpartum
depression, you ask? Plenty, as it turns out. One of the criteria
for measuring postpartum depression is the presence of feelings
of maternal inadequacy. And if you're in the business of making
mothers feel inadequate, you're compounding the problem.


Parents—especially mothers, for reasons of socialization as
much as biology—who carry this great bilious load of unattainable
expectations are punching a one-way ticket to Crazy Town. If our
baby isn't content and approvingly silent, like a neonatal customer
service supervisor, we have <i>failed</i>. It sounds risible on paper—of
course we haven't <i>failed</i>—but when you're sleep deprived and suddenly
isolated for long stretches of time, and you used to be the star
system administrator in the networking team or you used to discuss
Proust with your book group, you can quite literally go fucking
insane. Now, I'm not suggesting that parenting is a stultifying task.
The difference is that no one else is around to stroke your ego. Isn't
that what we crave?


And there's a considerable difference between <i>endorsing</i> certain
parenting techniques (such as breastfeeding or the family bed) and
<i>prescribing</i> what turns out to be, in essence, a regimen for living. If
you're going to wear a sling, why not wear an organic one? If you're
going to wear an organic sling, why not wear one hand-sewn by a
work-at-home mom? If you're going to wear an organic sling hand-sewn
by a work-at-home mom, make sure you feed your little one

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There's nothing wrong with any of these decisions. But can you
really do it all? Assuming you can even afford organic produce and
WAHM diapers (which is a classist assumption in itself), is it really
the end of the road for your kid if you bring home a trash bag full
of motley hand-me-down Legos instead of a Waldorf doll? If you
use sanitized thrift-store throw pillows instead of the homemade
cylindrical bolsters Dr. Sears suggests? Aren't you entitled to make
these sorts of decisions individually? To pick and choose? To feel
good about <i>some</i> of your accomplishments, even if you don't have a
perfect score?


When you are depressed, you reach a point when you cease to
be a rational being making a series of decisions; rather, you fluctuate
violently between Success and Failure at every turn. Every moment
is literally either a victory or a crisis. You are understimulating your
child or smothering her. You are feeding her hazardous pesticides.
That Infant Tylenol and Motrin might be destroying her liver. And
so you are locked in a cycle of anxiety, which feeds your depression,
which impairs your ability to cope, which increases your certainty
that you are the shittiest person alive.


You must be, since you're wearing the baby and you're still
depressed.


Attachment parenting has its uses, certainly. If you choose to
sleep in a bed with your baby, it's good to have solid medical backing
against the claim that you are sure to smother her or give her SIDS.

Finally, my search for like-minded people led me back to the
Internet.


I wrote to an expat friend I had made in Finland, a lesbian
mother of fraternal twins. She had put one baby down screaming
in order to diaper the other. She stopped breastfeeding. She was a
no-bullshit lady.


I wrote to her:


<i>I was reading</i> The Fussy Baby Book, <i>and the stories in the back
are so "Madison had horrible colic and reflux and ear infections,
and she screamed for seven months, and even now at age four
shell burst into tears if a door slams and only sleeps if I place her
facing north-northwest on a bamboo mat with a blue sock on and
a red sock on, but I wouldn't trade my high-need baby for anything
in the world! Once I adjusted my attitude, I realized I had
been given a precious gift!" Uhh... what? That's great for you,
if you feel that way, but I don't think I'm on that bus. I think I'm
on the bus with the crazy postpartum chicks</i>.

She wrote back with some wonderful advice: <i>Put Dr. Sears down.
Step away from The Book. No one will ever live up to the Holy Sainted
Madonna Stepford Wife Martha, so don't even try. And then get the hell
out of Dodge for a few hours</i>.


I did.
