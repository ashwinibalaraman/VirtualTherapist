Spilling the Beans


<i>May 14, 1991. 4:00 P.M. New York</i>.


After going back and forth with Kostabi's attorney all day, we
still haven't made any progress toward a resolution of the crisis.
I'm starting to panic about where I'm going to be sleeping
tonight. Koegel assures us that Mark isn't the slightest bit interested
in a restitution deal; he has taken good care of me financially,
he says, and I have been disloyal. And I was so positive that
my attorney, with his superpowers fueled by my retainer, would
have it settled by noon. Shit. This is a goddamn mess. I finally leave
Fox's office and take a cab back to the Upper West Side. I ask the
driver to let me off at Gray's Papaya on 72nd Street and Broadway,
where I buy my last two hot dogs as a free man and walk home up
Broadway enjoying the best hot dogs. Lots of ketchup and onions.
At home I call Annike and my friends from Kostabi World, gathering
as much information as possible about what's going on
there, and they sneak out to call me during their breaks. All the
locks have been changed, and Mark has hired a twenty-four-hour
security guard. Jessica, Mark's assistant, has been fired. Mark and
Heather are on their way back from Tokyo. The drama is getting
more and more exciting every minute. Fox calls and tells me that
there's no progress. I'm doomed. It's nearly 6:30 P.M. and I've almost
forgotten that I've been invited to dinner at my sister's apartment
tonight. My parents are going to be there. I get dressed
quickly and grab a cab crosstown. I roll down the window to take
in a few gulps of Central Park air. Gives me an energy boost.


The timing of this dinner couldn't be any worse, but for some

The Social Butterfly


The countdown to my arrest begins that night when I turn off the
lights and go to bed. My brain becomes further unhinged by the
stress of my legal circumstances, and the crisis makes me increasingly
manic. I dart from one obsessive errand to another—I have
all of my clothes dry-cleaned and shoes resoled and start compulsive
shopping, buying all kinds of unnecessary kitchen utensils
and household items. I involve myself in a busy social schedule—
parties, dinners, and movies, a full lineup of events. Sarah Wells, a
friend I know through dealing art, is in town and has invited a
group of friends to Le Cirque for dinner. Most of the people at the
table are dealers or artists, so we all have a lot in common. We talk
about the art market. The price of Warhols. The auctions. No one
brings up my legal situation. It's a perfectly fun night. I will schedule
and multitask my life back into normalcy.


I write a fax to Annike, who has decided to take a three-week
vacation in Germany:
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Annike,
</p>
<p>
Everything is still quiet on the Kostabi front. I think I told you
that Heather left Mark. Maybe she found that he was a fake and
not the real Kostabi. Carl [the receptionist] asks about you frequently.
Jessica is on her way to Italy for a family vacation.
</p><p>[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
Nothing very exciting to report about that place. I wish I could
tell you that a large bomb or fire had destroyed Kostabi World,
but no! I am still waiting to hear about several of my deals. I feel
very confident about the Rothko painting and Klimt painting. I
have a buyer for the Monet painting. She is a client of Ellen's
who lives in Chicago and I forwarded her the photographs of
the piece that Ken overnighted to me today. It's a pretty close
connection. All of the money I've made dealing art and counterfeiting
art is just about spent—on sushi, massages, nights at
the Mondrian Hotel, Armani and Yamamoto suits, French contemporary
paintings, airline tickets to Europe and Japan, documentary
films, and recycled jeans with the flag of Texas on the
knees. I really need to figure out a way to earn some money
soon. So the money issue for me is very scary, too, and we'll
have to have a conference about it when you come back to New
York. Annike, you say that there is almost no money at the
sunny horizon, but of course, there is. It just hasn't found its
way into our hands yet.

Love,<br />
Andy von Strudel


Late one night, I stand naked in the front of the bathroom
mirror, holding a pair of scissors in my hand, and start cutting big
pieces of hair from the bottom of both sides of my head, then just
chop random pieces from all over. I just don't have the strength to
overdose tonight or go out on an all-night drug binge. My hair is
completely uneven and resembles a bad wig. I am perfectly content
standing in piles of dark brown hair and am kind of pleased
with the damage I've done.


I call an old friend from Wesleyan, Sabrina Padwa, because I
know that she'll be up late, and tell her about what I've just done.
I take a cab to her apartment on the Upper East Side, and when I
arrive, she appears shocked at my appearance. We look at each
other and both start laughing. One side of my hair is considerably
shorter than the other and the whole thing is wildly uneven. She

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next morning, I return to Sabrina's apartment, and we
walk up Madison Avenue to Michael's, a barbershop that is famous
for kids' haircuts. We're both amused by the horses and cars
that the kids around us are sitting in. The barber takes one look at
me, raises his eyebrows, and tells us that he is just going to have to
cut off most of my hair. So he gives me a buzz cut—my first one
ever. I thank him for a great job, refuse the lollipop, and we walk
down the street; all the while Sabrina says encouraging things
about my new haircut, and I play with my bristly hair. We convince
each other that my trademark long hair is a thing of the past
and that this is the most perfect look for summer.


Miss Veronica


Since I'm two months behind in my rent, my landlord is more
than eager to let me out of my lease early. I move from my duplex
apartment on West 89th Street to a cheaper sublet, a studio on
West 81st Street. I sell all of my antique furniture back to the store
on the Upper West Side where I bought it, aptly named Better
Times, for about $6,000.


The new apartment is one empty room. Hardwood floors. It
echoes. I bring just a floral Ralph Lauren couch that Allison loved,
and I sleep in a Murphy bed. At night I sit and watch the traffic go
by on Columbus Avenue. Every day I wait anxiously to be arrested.
I've convinced myself that I'll be grabbed under the arms
by two plainclothes cops in dark suits and thrown into the backseat
of an unmarked car. Frightened about entering and exiting
my building, I avoid coming and going as much as possible. When
my intercom buzzes, I hide in the shower and wait five or ten minutes
before I come out. I panic when I hear footsteps near my door
and a Chinese menu comes sliding through. I wish they would just

One night I'm up late watching a documentary on early
Hollywood film pioneers that's starting to bore me. I don't know
what to do with myself. I'm a little stoned. Phone sex is not going
to satisfy me tonight. I grab the Yellow Pages and look under
"Escorts." "Manhattan Nights." Classy escort service. Upper East
Side. Since 1985. I saw the ad a few weeks ago, and I remember
I liked the graphics. It isn't a tacky limousine or a skyline of New
York or a big apple. It's just the profile of a slender and bosomy
woman. I call Miss Veronica. "Manhattan Nights," she says.
"Hello, I'm calling about your ad," I say. She pauses and asks me to
tell her something about myself, so I tell her that I'm a young professional
in my early thirties, that I travel, and that I'm just looking
for a massage. She tells me that it will cost me $200 for an hour-long
session. "That's fine," I say. She explains that it's late but that
she's still got a few girls available at her Upper East Side apartment.
She describes a few of them for me: a former <i>Penthouse</i>
model, a Brazilian beauty, and a statuesque Swede. "Tell me about
the Swede," I say. "What does she look like?" "She's lovely. She's
five feet nine, 125 pounds, 36-24-36, blond, and has beautiful, tan
skin," she says. She gives me her address, and I tell her I'll be there
by 1:00 A.M. I grab a couple of $100 bills, brush my teeth, and get
into a cab. I feel a rush of anticipation and excitement because I've
never been to a brothel. When I get to the building on East 79th
Street, I ring her apartment and she buzzes me in. In the elevator
I think about turning back. My heart is racing. The doorbell
makes a weird sticking noise. I feel like running, but a flaming
redhead in her midsixties, badly wrinkled from sun exposure,
opens the door. She is wearing bright orange lipstick, green eye
shadow, and orange nail polish and some type of housecoat that
isn't particularly flattering. "You must be Miss Veronica," I say.
"Yes, I am," she answers, shaking my hand and smiling. The living
room is painted red, and there are three girls inside glued to the
television. "You seem like an awfully nice young man," she says,
with a slight Eastern European accent similar to Dr. Kleinman's. "I

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My hand is shaking; I take out the two bills and give them to
her. She examines them as if they might be counterfeit. "Brand-new,"
I say. She laughs. She leads me to a dimly lit bedroom, where
a blond woman with dramatic makeup—glossy red lipstick, green
eye shadow, dark mascara, and rouge—and highlighted blond hair
is sitting on the edge of a king-sized bed, wearing just a black bra
and panties. "I hope you will enjoy," Miss Veronica says as she
leaves the room and closes the door. Standing in this bedroom,
sparsely furnished with a bed and night table, I feel pretty lonely.
Monika helps me out of my clothes and instructs me to lie facedown
on the bed. I look over my shoulder. She's taking off her bra
and panties and standing above me. She begins working my neck
and shoulders, taking warm oil from the night table and pouring
it all over my back, massaging it in. She has long legs like a dancer,
a flat stomach, and firm breasts that sway slightly as she bends
over me. Her pubic hair is shaved, and she has a piercing. She's
concentrating on my lower back and moving down my ass to my
thighs, and I'm getting turned on wondering where this is leading.
She's taking her time and starts teasing my balls from behind very
gently. Then she motions for me to turn over and massages my
thighs; my cock is totally stiff. She grabs it, pours some oil on it,
and strokes it while I'm playing with her breasts. I guess it's okay
for me to do that. After ten minutes of this, I come, and it's all
over. We say nothing to each other. I get dressed, thank her, leave
the apartment, and walk a few blocks to a diner that I know. I
order a bagel and cream cheese and then have a banana split,
which is what I probably needed in the first place.


Up All Night


Six months pass. Unemployment runs out. I've borrowed about
$7,500, and now friends stop loaning me money. I am not getting
any financial support from my family. So I pawn my watch, my
camera, and my great-grandfather's silver flask at Century Pawn-brokers

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm at the apartment of Sally Randall, one of Mark's favorite
painters at Kostabi World and a well-known name in the downtown
art scene, to celebrate her birthday. Sally is tall, with long
black hair and pale skin, and is leaning up against the kitchen door.
I can't quite get to her from where I am. The place is filled with
familiar faces, and of course everyone there is aware that I am one
of the alleged counterfeiters. They haven't seen me in months,
and I feel a bit uncomfortable. I'm drinking a vodka tonic to control
my agitation. I don't know why I decided to come to this
party in the first place. But I make my way over to Sally to wish

The Anxiety Shuffle


<i>February 21, 1992. New York</i>.


Still no word about Kostabi—the quiet is getting a little bit scary.
But as every day passes, I forget more and more what happened. It
feels like a weird dream, like I was on cocaine the entire time and
reality was distorted.


I hear through the grapevine, from Kostabi employees who
bump into Annike downtown, that it looks like the Manhattan
D.A.'s office is about to take some type of action against me. I
panic. I need a criminal defense attorney right away. My parents
find the name of one through a family connection. Stuart Abrams,
a gentle but intense man in his early forties, was formerly an assistant
U.S. attorney with the U.S. District Court in the Southern District
of New York. He agrees to see me the next day.


<i>February 28, 1992</i>.


I shower and dress, take the subway to Grand Central, and meet
with Stuart at his office in the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue.
Legal books line his shelves, and files are piled high on his desk,
next to photos of his children, who have red hair like he does. I
stammer through the story, impressed with how calm and non-judgmental
he seems. He doesn't even crack a smile. After about a
half hour, he tells me he's relatively confident that my case isn't
the type the D.A.'s office will take on because it's a ridiculous one
with an unbelievable witness—Kostabi. He warns me not to speak
to anyone who calls me about the case and to "sit tight and wait it
out" and that "hopefully the case will be dropped." I leave his office
feeling a confidence I haven't known in a while.


<i>March 1, 1992</i>.


Lauren and Jonathan are a great comic duo who play off each
other quite well, and I'm always entertained by their humorous
interaction. One night, when Lauren is nine months pregnant, she
and Jonathan invite me over to dinner. When I arrive Lauren is in

<i>March 13, 1992</i>.


In two weeks Stuart calls me with the good news. The Manhattan
D.A.'s office has turned down the case. Tremendous relief. I can
breathe. The assistant district attorney thinks the case isn't strong
enough—there are obvious credibility problems and it will be difficult
to prove that the paintings were unauthorized. But soon I'm
contacted by a detective who wants to interview me, and we learn
that the Eastern District (including Brooklyn and Queens) has
taken on the case. The representative of the Japanese company involved
is located in their jurisdiction, and this is where faxes were
transmitted and monies were wired. I tell the detective I have been
advised not to speak with him.


Offshore Accounts


In the meantime Annike and I have delusions of dealing art on an
international level. Thoughts of vast sums of money being wired
into my "special account" at Citibank and of transferring monies
from my Swiss account to my offshore account fuel my fantasies.
We actually set up shop in two different locations, my studio and
her studio, with two phone lines, two faxes, and Rolodexes of
dealers, galleries, and art journals, and we're ready to get to work.
Annike is confident that we can combine my sales skills and her
contacts in Europe to sell paintings. She knows many international
art dealers and tells me stories about their incredible successes.
These delusions of making hundreds of thousands of
dollars are a part of my mania and serve to repress the nightmare
of the whole Kostabi debacle. But we actually start to break into a
network of dealers, agents, and gallery owners, meeting them
mostly by phone, by referral from dealers we already know or just
by cold calling, but also some in person. Since we have no direct
clients who own actual works, we're fighting an uphill battle. For

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A friend who is a dealer in the Midwest hooks me up with
a young New York dealer whose family has a lot of money and
an impressive contemporary collection. He invites me to meet
him for lunch at La Goulue on Madison Avenue. I arrive ten minutes
early and wait on the sidewalk. I spot him across the street
right away. He's wearing a navy blue double-breasted blazer, white
khakis, a white linen shirt, and dark sunglasses. His dark black hair
is slicked back, and he's sunburned. He looks like he's about
twenty-three. I walk over and introduce myself. "You must be
David. I'm Andy Behrman," I say. "Nice to meet you," he says.
The waiter seats us at a table on the sidewalk, and David lights up
a cigarette and blows the smoke straight above him. "Kate tells me
you're an incredibly brilliant guy," he says. "And you know how to

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Annike and I have isolated ourselves from everybody, and
now we enter the Tofu and Banana Period. It's all we have money
for. That and the occasional stolen cheese and crackers from
the corner deli. Annike has such an artful way of presenting tofu
and bananas on a plate—she makes them look so beautiful, so
delicious—that I look forward to each meal with tremendous delight.
We are waiting to be indicted and still deluding ourselves
that one of our million-dollar deals is going to come through at
any minute. We're desperate. I even borrow $50 from the corner
newsstand vendor I hang out with at 3:00 A.M. We're shuttling between
my sublet and Annike's studio in Jersey City, paying rent on
neither, and waiting to be evicted from both. One morning I do
not receive my usual wake-up call from Annike. I can't find her all
day. I leave message after message and fax but get no response.
Later that evening my phone rings. Her voice is faint. She's admitted
herself to Payne Whitney, a psychiatric hospital on the Upper
East Side, and she assures me she's fine, but that they want to hold
on to her for a few days for observation. The survival game has
gotten to her.

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I go to visit her, she is wearing a white hospital gown
with a light blue star print. Her skin is bright white, her lips dry
and peeling. I ask her if she is hungry or thirsty. She tells me she's
just eaten some eggs. I'm relieved. She tells me that they've put
her in the same room Marilyn Monroe stayed in thirty years prior,
a fact that appeals to her sense of history and drama. I pretend to
be amused. But I feel isolated and alone. Annike has given up on
herself and on me. She was the one who told me how important
the survival game was, how we both needed each other. She
didn't come to me when she needed me. I realize how selfish and
sick I am. I need her, and I will be alone until they release her from
this hospital. Now I have to eat tofu and bananas on my own.


Annike pushes to be released from the hospital and they let
her go after five days. I'm even more protective of her now, like an
older brother of his sister. I don't want her dealing with the same
kind of stress she's had recently. I keep her with me at my studio
for a while to keep an eye on her and stop her art-dealing activities
for a few days. We're running low on money, and I start stealing
more food from the deli by shoving it in my knapsack while no
one is looking. It's pretty easy. When we realize we're still not
making progress and the pressure is about to spill over, I finally
borrow $2,000 from an old friend, telling him I need to get to Europe
to close a business deal. Given the sums of money I used to
deal with, it seems like such a small amount to ask for, but I feel
like I've asked for the universe—and it'll certainly get us as far as
we need to go. Annike and I decide to leave the country and go to
the Basel Art Fair, then continue on to visit dealers in Germany.
Our official intention is to meet some of the dealers we've been
talking to, to solidify our relationships and to establish new ones,
but we really have no specific business to address. The idea of leaving
the country together is what's really driving us, and I fantasize
that we will never return.

The Von Strudel Diaries


Annike's attorney warns her that her telephone line could be
tapped, so we both become paranoid and stop communicating by
phone, using only our fax machines to get in touch with each
other. Our messages go back and forth day and night. Late at
night, the sound of the phone ringing and the clicking noise of the
fax machine wake us up.


Will I come back to the United States if I go to Europe?
Should I just flee the country now and avoid a trial? I was
thinking of opening a laundromat in Istanbul or cohosting
Jessica Hahn's fantasy show. Or maybe I'll just stay in
bed all day and eat boxes and boxes of Mike and Ikes until
I get sick.—Andy von Strudel


I'm very scared about the buzzing and the knocking on
my door this morning. I really have to relax. I have to pretend
the D.A. and the I.R.S. are all on vacation.—Andy
von Strudel


I understand the fear—the confusion—the reaction to
inner and outer pressure and that you don't sleep. You always
sleep when I'm at your house at night. Maybe I
should be considered as your sleeping pill.—Annike


Why does it seem like when we're just about ready to
starve—when we're right on the verge of collapse—
money comes through from somewhere?—Andy von
Strudel


Before our flight—we have to take care of: the photos of
the Hockney, the Picasso ceramics, close the O'Keeffe
sale, make sure George's money is in the bank, buy airline
tickets for Germany, pick up prescriptions from Dr.

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got a prescription today for 100 Prozac—can we afford it
somehow?—Andy von Strudel


I have a client who wants to put a 10% deposit down on
the Atlantic Ocean. He needs to see a transparency first.
I'll have David overnight one.—Andy von Strudel


I feel very lonely without you being here. The only communication
I have is with Sylvia Plath and Gertrude
Stein.—Annike


Do you think maybe it would be better if we separated
and I went alone to Israel to live on a kibbutz to pick
pears? I'm going to watch television all afternoon. I'm
never going to eat food again. I think I want to die.—
Andy von Strudel


My phone was just cut off today—but I can still dial out
on my fax line.—Andy von Strudel


I have a 36 x 24 inch Warhol Soup Can (1964) from a
very important collection. It's red and white tomato
soup (most desirable). Our price is $320,000.—Andy von
Strudel


I'm scared. My eggs are having two yellow egg yolks each.
Is that a very American mutation?—Annike


Here's my advice. Take many deep breaths. Smell the
fresh air. Drink chamomile tea. Life is very short. You
spend more time in your lifetime dead than you do
alive.—Andy von Strudel

Dear Mom and Dad:


I spoke to Nancy and she told me that you were a little bit concerned
about me, since you hadn't heard from me since two
weekends ago when I saw you in East Hampton. I'm alive and
well—don't worry. I had to get away from my routine in New
York. I "fired" Dr. Kleinman because he medicated me like an
absolute lunatic, and after that I decided I wanted to take a
break from therapy. So here I am in Munich—I feel pretty
healthy and well balanced. I had a free frequent flyer ticket. I'm
staying with two German guys (Dietmar and Dieter) who I met
at a party of a mutual friend. I'm helping them organize tours
from Frankfurt to Majorca. It's not great money, but I will get
to travel and meet lots of people. They also own a chain of
laundromats in Munich called "Seifenmeister," which translates
to Mr. Soap (I'm writing this letter from there now).
They're a bit eccentric and Dietmar has a wild collection of Indian
headdresses on these weird non-Indian mannequins.
Dad—I took plenty of pictures. Dieter is Jewish. Dieter Metzger
—it means butcher in German. His parents met at a concentration
camp and stayed in Berlin until the late '60s, when
they moved here. I met his mother for the first time and she reminds
me a little bit of you, Mom. Please don't worry about
me—I'm fine. I'm sorry that it's taken me a month to write, but
I will write often. I put all of my things into storage and it'll be
fine for a year. I even took care of Dr. Ruben—the lump was

Auf wiedersehen

Escape to Switzerland


<i>June 18, 1992. New York</i>.


It's finally the day to depart for the Basel Art Fair. I organize my
suitcase carefully: my navy blue Yamamoto double-breasted suit,
three dress shirts, and three ties. I pack my slides and transparencies,
my last forty capsules of Prozac, and all of my canceled
credit cards—I know I might be able to use them.


Annike meets me at my apartment, and we take a cab to
Newark Airport, arriving early for our flight to Hamburg. We've
spent most of the money we've borrowed on the tickets but still
have about $600 left. She repeatedly tells me not to be concerned
about money. I'm struggling to figure out how we're going to
manage a weeklong stay on so little. Hotels. Car. Food. Gas. But I
have faith in Annike, because she's never let me go hungry. As I
notice people forming a line near the gate, I start to feel like I'm
fleeing the country to avoid arrest. But this is just self-induced
paranoia. I haven't been indicted yet, and I have a passport and am
free to travel abroad. I'm just afraid that while I'm away something
might come up and they won't be able to find me. I'm eager
to board the flight and take our art-dealing show to another continent,
confident that we're going to hit the jackpot this time with a
million-dollar sale. I actually believe it will happen.


It's early morning when we arrive in Germany, and we rent a
brand-new Volkswagen with my canceled American Express Gold
Card. Nobody checks it through a computer. They just take an imprint.
Not my problem. Stay calm. Hurry. Get in the car. Annike
speeds out of the parking lot onto the Autobahn, and we're on
our way to Basel. I'm having fun mispronouncing the names of

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We arrive in Basel and check in at the hotel, and I immediately
become suspicious of any men with blond hair, which is kind of
ridiculous, but I'm on the lookout for Kostabi, who never misses
this show. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to say to him if I see
him. Maybe I'll try to sell him a painting. Or maybe I'll sign his
autograph for him. I take a quick shower and get dressed in my
art-dealer suit—I'm an art dealer again. Annike puts on her female
version—a taupe knee-length skirt, a beige silk blouse, and
heels—which is very conservative for her. Briefcases in hand,
we go to the exhibition hall, which consists of what seems like
miles and miles of booths, in which exhibiting gallery owners
and dealers are selling "our" wares—including our $25,000,000
van Gogh, the very same one we have received a slide of from
a dealer in Chicago and passed on to another dealer who supposedly
had a bank interested in acquiring it. There's not a chance
that anybody will ever buy this painting through us; we just don't
have those connections. After about two hours, I realize we're
not making much progress. We have arranged some meetings
with dealers and gallery owners in advance, but we haven't met
anybody on our list yet and we're just looking at booths. I'm not
finding this very helpful and I'm getting tired, so we decide to call
it a day.


At 10:00 the next morning I meet with Stephen Curtis, a Los
Angeles-based private dealer, to discuss the sale of a $3.2 million
Renoir painting that his client is interested in purchasing. Annike
is having coffee with a German dealer at a café, and I'm going to
meet her for lunch at noon. We're sitting in the lobby lounge of
his hotel having breakfast, and he assures me that his client is prepared
to make a deposit on the painting and then view it. If he
likes it, he'll wire the balance directly into Stephen's account and
the deal will be done. I have access to the portrait of a mother
with child through another dealer in Los Angeles, who tells me
that she has direct access to its owner. There really is no reason for

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Things aren't exactly going as planned. I wake up the next
morning and realize I don't know if Annike really has an itinerary
for this trip to Europe. I tell her I'm a bit angry and am not sure it
was worth borrowing the money to make it happen, and she
calms me down, pushing me into the shower. When I come out I
see that she has taken a thick black Magic Marker and drawn on
the white wall a huge map of Germany complete with all of our
stops and our route—literally our itinerary. I'm shocked and think
she's getting a little crazy. But this is how she makes her point—
she knows exactly where we're going. I'm impressed but at the
same time somewhat nervous that the maid is going to walk into
the room and see the wall before we leave. Now we just have to escape
from this desecrated hotel room without paying.


We won't be deterred. We convince ourselves that the $20 left
in my pocket is the mark of astounding success and it's time for us
to leave Basel and head to Germany. Our first stop is Munich, to
meet Annike's family. Her parents, a robust couple in their sixties,
greet me warmly and offer us all kinds of food—meats, cheeses,
breads, vegetables, salads, and drinks—in the middle of the afternoon.
Annike's father is proud of his relatively good English, and
her mother gestures very well. We accept their offer to stay overnight,
and busy ourselves putting together slides and typing letters
to dealers. I sense they actually believe we're dealing art successfully.
After all, we have flown from New York to Hamburg, rented
a car, stayed in luxury hotels, and brought them gifts.


Dachau is our next stop. I don't know exactly what to expect,
but for some reason I imagine a huge sign with ten-foot-tall letters.

ARBEIT MACHT FREI, read the words over the gatehouse. "Work
makes one free." I'm overwhelmed by the quiet. We walk over to
the memorial to those who were murdered at the camp and tour
the ovens and gas chambers. I feel like I've stepped onto the set of
one of the documentaries and there's no one there to direct me. I
feel like I'm on sacred ground. I'm looking for all of the extras in
their striped prison garb, but there is nobody in sight. I guess they
aren't needed anymore. This is a deserted prison camp, a graveyard
that's filled in with green trees and grass. I look down at my
feet. There is a dandelion growing between the cracks in the concrete.


Walking around the grounds, I feel numb, disconnected from
what happened here almost fifty years ago. "I'm ready to leave," I
tell Annike. I walk back through the gates and leave Dachau behind
as an emerald-green memory. We drive on to Cologne and
Dusseldorf, visiting private dealers and galleries, making more
empty deals along the way, collecting more promises and adding
more charges to my credit cards. When we finally return to the
airport, we just leave the car in front of the terminal, so as not
to cause any trouble at the car-rental return area. Someone will
find it.

The Diagnosis


<i>October 6, 1992. New York</i>.


I'm not taking Prozac because I can't afford it—it's $3 a pill—
and I'm not even sure it's doing anything for me. I don't have any
way of paying for a psychiatrist, and I can't seem to articulate to
my parents how urgently I need professional help again. My
mother calls me and tells me that they're coming into the city for
dinner and asks me to join them, so I meet them that night at Demarchelier
on the Upper East Side. I'm not used to eating at
restaurants like this anymore, so I feel a bit out of place. They ask
about what's going on in my life, specifically the progress I'm making
finding employment, and I tell them some concocted story
about having looked for PR work with a couple of different agencies,
with no luck. I tell them I'm looking into other things, and
that I can't afford to see a therapist again right now and I desperately
need to see one. But they've been through a rough time
with me—my ongoing unemployment and my legal problems—
and they're a bit confused about my mental state and where I'm
headed and my future plans. I feel really uncomfortable about
asking them to bail me out again like they have so many times in
the past. They feel that I've seen more than my fair share of therapists
and hope I'll find some type of job and make a living. They
offer many suggestions. I should try something new. Something
creative, perhaps. Or try to go to work for somebody in a stable
environment. I could think about going back to school to get a
business or law degree, or rebuild my PR company. They even talk
about my going to work for my mother's recruiting business.
They're extremely encouraging, but they want me to pull myself
out of this ditch on my own. And I don't really expect them to
rescue me this time either. That night I call my sister and I tell her
about the severity of my situation. I try to explain my condition to
her as best I understand it. She agrees without hesitation to pay
for me to see a psychiatrist once a week. I'm shocked. This is an
extremely kind offer on her part, since we really haven't had the

<i>October 8, 1992. New York</i>.


I call Sandy, an old friend and colleague from Nancy's PR agency,
and ask her if she wants to get together to talk about starting our
own agency. I know that she's relatively unhappy at her job, and
after a few meetings we're confident that together we can find a
few clients to promote and work out of my apartment. At this
point my sister is doing well enough that my poaching an employee
is not going to upset her, and we discuss it before the actual
transition. Sandy and I give ourselves the name Agency 4, and
soon we are promoting everything from authors and doctors to
restaurants and gyms. After a few months we are doing well
enough to move both our office and my apartment to executive
office space on 51st Street and Seventh Avenue, next door to the

Going Cold Turkey


A bunch of Jonathan's actor friends tell him about an excellent
therapist they all go to on the East Side. So after Jonathan has seen
Dr. Solnick a few times and recommends him, I decide to give him
a try. I cancel my appointments with Dr. Golub and tell him that I
no longer can continue treatment with him for financial reasons.
I'm also not feeling like I'm making much progress. Although I
feel he has properly diagnosed me, I'm not responding well to the
medication. Lithium is not effective for all manic-depressives, and
Prozac is usually not used to treat manic-depressives; it can induce
mania. I tell my sister that I have found a doctor I can afford on my
own and make an appointment to see Dr. Solnick, who is opposed
to treating his patients with medication. I am curious about this
because I feel open to a new approach to my psychological problems.
When I tell Dr. Solnick, a middle-aged psychiatrist with a
hint of a British accent, about my pharmacological regimen, he
immediately dismisses it as "overmedication" without really listening

Within a few days I notice that my thoughts are becoming increasingly
unhinged. It's as if chunks of my brain have been
scooped out, like the part that edits my thoughts before they become
speech. I talk nonstop to friends and family about the case,
babbling about anything that comes to mind. It's sort of like that
nervous energy you feel right before you have to give a speech, or
what actors must feel before they go on stage. Only I feel it all the
time. "Andy, relax," my father says rather gruffly one morning
when it's clear he's exasperated by my chatter.


I'm beginning to wonder if Dr. Solnick has done the right
thing. But those times when I'm able to focus on winning my case,
I feel a powerful euphoria wash over me, filling me with a sense of
confidence that I hope will last through this trial.
