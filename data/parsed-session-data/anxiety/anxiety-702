[00:06:21]
CLIENT: So, I found myself thinking yesterday about why, why everyone, I don't know, has to be thoughtful and rational, and sometimes I don't know why I feel so passionate about that. That it really bothered me or [pause]. I don't know. Because I feel like I really, feel like that, and kind of believe that. I don't know why. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_513');">[note]</a><div id="_note_513" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>As we have seen in previous transcripts, "A" often picks up where she left off the day before. Having back-to-back sessions is particularly effective because patients often use the 24 or so hours between sessions to work on the material brought up in the previous session in part because the previous session is fresh in the patient's mind. In once/ weekly treatment, the content from the previous week can often get lost, giving the following session of feeling of starting over.</b></div>
Just I think like when I'm in situations, I don't know what to think. Like, some situations are easier, then it's easier for me to pull myself out and take a look back. So, I just feel like it's so deeply rooted. Obviously, because we were talking yesterday [inaudible 0:07:16] upset or annoyed about it, and I have no idea what to do about it. So....
[00:07:25]
And so, I don't know. And I feel like when I'm thinking of it, I just feel like it's such a–to me, it's such a basic thing that I just, it's like I really can't get over the point, but I'm thinking like how could you not do or think, you know, until I see [inaudible 0:07:55], and then, I feel stuck. 
[00:08:02]
It is a little frustrating, too. I feel a lot times, I am not really like patient sometimes with my progress here. And then, it comes out like, I don't know, like a couple weeks later I feel like a small obstacle, I don't know if more talking will help, but I felt really stuck yesterday. 
THERAPIST: Can you say more about feeling impatient with the progress here sometimes?

<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2137');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2137" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Psychoanalytic therapists pay close attention when patients bring up their feelings about the treatment. First, patients' feelings about the treatment often reflect difficulties they are having in general. When these feelings are brought into the therapeutic relationship, they have an aliveness and immediacy. Second, patients are our best supervisors. Their feedback can help us better respond to their needs.</b></div> 
CLIENT: Well, as we talked about, I think in terms of a roadmap, and that I feel like when I identify something, it should be fixed then. And well obviously, it doesn't happen like that. So, I don't know–time is what helped experiences and again and I feel like I, I don't know, like I just want the situation to be resolved and done.
THERAPIST: What does resolved mean? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2969');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2969" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is a crucial question for "A". One of "A"'s main difficulties is that she looks for things to be clear and simple. Unfortunately, very few things in life are, which create challenges for her, especially in dealing with her feelings and her relationships.</b></div>
[00:09:08]
CLIENT: I don't know. To feel or, like, –when I'm in a certain situation not to feel as upset or [pause] I don't know, it's like I have this thing in my head where like, I don't know. I think it's like, flick on a switch and then...things that bother me won't, I mean, I don't I feel like, that's not the case, but [trails off].
THERAPIST: Do you ... <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3648');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3648" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is struggling with the idea that her feelings should be "resolved". By resolved, she seems to mean that her negative feelings will go away.  I focus on this because this is expectation can never be met. If she expects that therapy will enable her no longer to feel upset, she not be satisfied with the treatment.</b></div>
CLIENT: Probably not [laughs], from talking about it, but [pause] I mean, on some level, yes. But [pause] yeah. I guess I don't know because I still–I think like that Yeah and then, there's–I think I don't like the feeling of not knowing so then I–I don't know. Like, I always–and it gets just so uncomfortable for me that I want a way to fix it, asap.
[00:10:20]
THERAPIST: Well again, the fixing. I'm not sure what that means. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_4451');">[note]</a><div id="_note_4451" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I want to help her explore her expectations about "resolving" or "fixing".</b></div>
CLIENT: Overcome, I guess. Come to terms with or [pause] when I think of it, I think of it as a fix, which I guess it's not.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I felt like yesterday one thing that you got stuck on was like it seemed like the fixing was about people changing, to live according to your expectations. Like, that is how things could be fixed. 
CLIENT: Right. And then, I was thinking along that. And I know that that's not the case, but I don't know what to change within myself. So I am not so annoyed all the time. 
[00:11:08]
Because I like was stuck on it for like, you know, how could you not think that, or that I feel like I need to fix myself. But I don't know what to do [inaudible 0:11:23] upset in those situations, but I don't know. I think I realized that people, I don't know, I think I have a problem with I realize that people aren't going to change. So, after like I've changed myself maybe or the way I think about that because then, I don't know in some situations like how or what to do with that. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_5617');">[note]</a><div id="_note_5617" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>All of us harbor the feeling at times that if only other people change, all of our problems would go away. For some people, this is an ever present wish. "A" is having a  difficult time accepting that she doesn't have control over others. She desperately wants others to change, so she will no longer feel upset or unhappy.</b></div> 
And, Jamie and I had that little squabble last night where I felt like he was being like what we were talking about yesterday, like annoyed with me, and it was over finding a new doctor. He's trying to help me find a new doctor because I just wasn't very happy with the one I was seeing, and when I was looking on the insurance website, I was looking in the wrong area, and I was looking by admitting hospitals to see where you can have access if you have to go to the hospital. And then, I was trying to find like [inaudible 0:12:31] and I was having a hard time doing it, and I was clicking on the actual doctors, their insurance accepted–didn't say [inaudible 0:12:38] PPO. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6656');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6656" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>When patients make comments about their "doctor", psychoanalytic clinicians listen to this as an allusion to the therapist. "A" has spent the session up to this point saying that the trwatment is not meeting her expectations and now she is talking about switching doctors. I should have directly taken up with her whether she was thinking about switching therapists because she was disappointed in the treatment.</b></div>
[00:12:39]
So then, he said that he'd help me and when he helped he like looked in a different area, and found it in two seconds, and then, he was like really ticked off that I couldn't find it myself. And then, he went into this whole thing like I don't care about my healthcare and I don't want to spend time doing research. You know, I was like well, I looked at it for a long time, and really if I could find it on my own, I wouldn't have asked for help. But I don't know, I felt like he was–he was really angry that I didn't offer like him, I don't know, like I felt like he was so–he was more angry that like, I don't know, that he found it like quicker than me, or I don't know. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_7802');">[note]</a><div id="_note_7802" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is talking about asking for help but not getting it. In retrospect, I hear this as an allusion to the treatment–she is not getting the help she needs. This would have been useful for me to address with her.</b></div>
[00:13:18]
And then, just led into this big discussion on how he thinks that I'm like I don't want to take the initiative to fix anything, which maybe that's partially true. But it just went into this big, whole long spiel at like 11:30 at night. And I don't know, I felt like the conversation we were having yesterday, like I was sitting on, like, on the opposite side. I don't know. Just that that made me think more of changing myself in terms of being annoyed with people [mumbling].
THERAPIST: Well, would it mean that you felt he was sort of acting the way you feel you could act? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_8657');">[note]</a><div id="_note_8657" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" made an interesting observation that yesterday she felt in her boyfriend's position, namely, of being upset that her expectations weren't being met. Now she's on the "opposite side", being the one not to meet expectations. I encourage her to elaborate on this.</b></div>
CLIENT: Like the way I get really frustrated with people or, like, he was like why wouldn't you search in this area? And it's just like I didn't think to do it. Like, sorry. 
[00:14:14]
So, I felt like the way that I feel, like I'm annoyed with people sometimes, like why would I think you think that. I don't know. I feel like he felt like that with me last night..that towards me. [00:14:29]. And then, being on that end, I kind of feel like defeated because I'm like–or when someone tells me–I don't know. For some reason, the words like you don't care, really bother me. And so, that is just like an ultimate thing that just like sends me off in fighting mode. But yeah, I'm like well, maybe you can admit that you were, I don't know, I don't want to tell him what he feels but I feel like what he was really feeling was like annoyance that he found it quicker, and I couldn't do it faster. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9874');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9874" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" hears her boyfriend being critical of her for not doing something fast enough. This is the same frustration she feels with herself in the treatment. I could have said something like, "it seems like both of you are frustrated with your progress."</b></div>
[00:15:07]
Because I don't think I do not care and it was an issue, but because I had spent a lot of time looking at it, and I just couldn't figure it out. So then, you know, that's when he offered to help. But I don't know. I was really annoyed
THERAPIST: Well clearly, it meant something to him that you couldn't figure it out. 
CLIENT: Right. And so then, that just makes me feel like well, if you're going to get angry because I can't figure something out at like, and I'm sure I would've figured it out eventually, but I wasn't–I don't know, it comes in and you're like fumbling and someone offers to help you, like I feel like there was a consequence with me asking for help. 
Because I know that if I sat there, like, looking at the website, I would have found it eventually or I would've called. But yeah, so I feel like that's almost like, I don't know, [Interposing]. But yeah with my dad or with, sometimes like people really don't want to help, and I thought it was frustrating that oh, you offered to help and then, he's so annoyed of it. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11253');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11253" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is saying that there's a price to be paid for asking for help, a comment I could have made. She also brings up her dad, which appears to come out of the blue but is clearly on her mind. I could also have commented how being criticized brings her dad to mind.</b></div>
[00:16:28]
So, I don't know. Yeah. And so, clearly something ticked him off and it meant something to him  but I don't know, it's not like I was–I was annoyed because I was searching and then he's like you don't care. And I'm like I do care. Been searching for like the last 40 minutes or so. And I can't call because they're closed. And then, I just had the feeling like well, if you're going to be angry at me or upset with me because I didn't do things like exactly how you would do them. Then, I don't know, we're different people. And you're probably always going to be upset with me. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12153');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12153" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Yesterday, "A" spoke about how other people fail her. Now she is talking about how she feels like she fails others, in this case her boyfriend. It may have been helpful for me to say something like, "relationships are so tough because it feels like someone is always falling short of expectations".</b></div>
[00:17:09]
And then, that made me start thinking [inaudible 0:17:11] a little bit. So, [00:17:23], I've been thinking in terms of myself and I don't like being annoyed all the time. I think differently or put things into a different perspective, and in those situations where I'm not so annoyed. 
THERAPIST: Well, it sounds like with Jamie last night, like you were reaching out for help, which is not necessarily a comfortable thing for you to do, and that you felt shot down. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I think like on a–on a small scale. Like I didn't really, I definitely think that there are things like, I don't know, like it didn't seem like such a big deal to ask him for that help because I don't know. I feel like some things I like really need to like muster, like the courage can you help me? But this was just like, I don't know,  feel like I was playing around with the internet looking for–and he offered, I said yeah, but–yeah. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13451');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13451" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I felt that "A" minimized how upset she was that her efforts at asking for help were dismissed.</b></div>
[00:18:24]
So, I don't know if shot down is the word, but I definitely felt like there were like, I don't know, just, made me think of my dad again, like, all of a sudden if you asked for help, it was used against you. So, I [inaudible 0:18:39] a little bit. I don't know. And I'm sure he wanted to help, but I don't think he's like, I don't know. I don't know if he would've offered if he didn't want to, but then I end up feeling like well, I don't know [inaudible 0:18:57] have to be so angry about it, but you offer it in the first place.
[00:19:02]
But I think that's me thinking in terms of myself, like if I was going to be disgruntled, it probably would not have helped. But...[pause] yeah. So, I don't know. There's sort of like a whole like motivation thing that really bothers. Like, you didn't care to look. And then, he just like harps on that, and then, I'm like I did care. Maybe the real reason is that you're angry that I didn't get it fast enough, or–
THERAPIST: Yeah. That's my theory. My theory is that something worried him about your not being able to figure it out. And that if he's explained that as you don't care, then he doesn't have to be worried that you couldn't figure it out, it was simply a matter of motivation and not some sort of ability in this way for you. I mean, I don't know why it would worry him, but clearly, the idea that maybe you just didn't know was very upsetting to him. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_15045');">[note]</a><div id="_note_15045" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Here, I am trying to help "A" understand what might be going through her boyfriend's mind so she feels less victimized by him. I was trying to move her away from "look what he's done to me" to "what might be going on for him". When people are able to think about the other people's motivations, they feel less of victimized by their actions. My attempts at moving her to a more reflective space didn't work.</b></div>
[00:20:04]
CLIENT: Right. And then, that's like definitely how I felt because yeah, like, I was like literally so annoyed I was like I care, why–I don't know. I think maybe said that I don't know. He's an extremely like timely, speedy person, and I'm just not as speedy as him. So, that becomes a problem sometimes. And then, our little conflict ended with me being like well, if I can never live up to your expectations or if you think that, you know, that something worried him, I felt that like that, we need to identify that. Because if I am going to [inaudible 0:20:45] be like wrong or a loss, like that's really not fair to me.
And then, he got really angry, like wanted to go to sleep. Which at that point, I was very tired and I said fine. But yeah, I don't know why he–and I think he does that like frequently. If something worries him a little bit, he uses motivation as like a reason. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16407');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16407" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is not interested in where her boyfriend is coming from. She feels mistreated and wants conveys that.</b></div>
[00:21:14]
And then, that bothers me because I feel like I am motivated to do something, but just because I don't do it on a–your terms, doesn't mean that I don't want to [00:21:25]. The subject of travel, like that we always fight about, he'll be like well, you just don't want to travel, which isn't true. But I don't spend every single spare minute that I have in life researching future trip ideas. I just go, like, but it doesn't mean that I don't want to do it. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_17028');">[note]</a><div id="_note_17028" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>The reason she can't think about her boyfriend's vulnerabilities is they set off her own. "A" struggles both with having high expectations that no one meets and feeling frustrated that others have too high of expectations for her. This is her internal struggle which gets played out with Jamie because his behavior reflects her inner her struggle. "A" believes the problem exists between him and her, and not primarily as an problem within her that gets stimulated by the way he acts. Psychoanalytic theory proposes that we often chose the people we do to play out interpersonally, an internal struggle.</b></div> 
THERAPIST: Well, I do think it's important to think about why you've chosen to be–I mean, I'm sure there's–why we choose the people we do is complicated. You have chosen to be with someone who could be very hard of you [ph]. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_17895');">[note]</a><div id="_note_17895" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I think this is an important point to draw "A"'s attention to.</b></div> 
CLIENT: And sometimes I like that, but because I have very high expectations for myself and–and I want it other ways that we match that are very high expectations of each other. But I don't know, like some of them, I just feel like silly is not a good word because it's not silly to him, and it's not fun to me. 
[00:22:23]
But I don't know. The ones–I don't know, like the travel and things. Like I just feel like–I ended up thinking like how in the world do you have all the time to do this because I don't have all this spare time. So, if you want to give me a secret tip on how to [inaudible 0:22:40], but [pause] yeah. 
So yeah, and I don't know why it's such [pause] a big deal. And it's just like–I mean, I can be like this, in some respects, that everything is extremely black and white you love it and you want to do it, or you hate it. Like, you can't be like–it's like if I say that I like something, and it doesn't match the level of which he likes it, then I don't like it. And that's very frustrating.
[00:23:19]
[Pause]. So, I definitely felt last night was really annoying, it's like a–I did feel like it was–he was upset about something and I really think he was because I couldn't do it, like it was, you know, fast as him or, you know? And then, I think to use that, as, I don't know, like you're not motivated, it's just [inaudible 0:23:52]. So, and then, he's just like well, why wouldn't you call if you were having a hard time? And it's like it's the evening and they're closed, like I tried calling a couple of days and they were closed. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19608');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19608" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" has said the word "closed" several times. If she were in a more introspective place, I may commented on this to see what her thoughts about it were. When patients repeat words throughout the session, it can be helpful to draw their attention to it and wonder with them about it.</b></div>
[00:24:03]
So, like I can't–I don't know, and then, I kept on making like excuses for myself, and I'm like it's not immediate right now, I need to find a new doctor. You know? And so, that's when I started to feel like really, really frustrated because I'm like hey, I was looking before–I looked and then I called the other day, they were closed, they were closed again, like–
THERAPIST: Why do you think you're justifying yourself? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20382');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20382" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm picking up on her observations that she feels the need to make excuses for herself. Again, I am hoping to help her focus on what is going on inside of her.</b></div> 
CLIENT: Because I think I end up feeling like, I don't know if there's something wrong with me, but I'm like maybe I should be more speedy or timely, or I don't know. 
THERAPIST: So, he's speaking–when he's saying this, he's speaking to an insecurity within yourself? He's stimulating that insecurity. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20892');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20892" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Again, I'm trying to shift her focus from "look what he doing to me" to "what going on inside of me".</b></div>
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I feel like I'm normally not insecure about things like that. But if you're like–if it's a problem for you and you're angry with me about it, and I did what I thought I could, but then I think, it kind of creates an insecurity.
THERAPIST: I don't think so.
CLIENT: No?
THERAPIST: No
[00:25:12]
THERAPIST: I say that only because you go to defending yourself. Because you're taking it on as your problem. You're not saying, you know, obviously there's something upsetting you. Like, you're seeing it as your problem, not his problem. 
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean–yeah. I also think that it's–when it's happening, I feel like it's me and not something like, set him off to be upset. 
[00:26:00]
Yeah. I never really thought about it that way. But then, I don't like wind up feeling like that, like it brings out, like, I feel like, a little bit of an insecurity.  But I never thought of like–never felt like going to defense mode and having it be my problem and not his. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_22103');">[note]</a><div id="_note_22103" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Something about my last two interventions got through to her because she became more reflective, "I never really thought about it that way"</b></div>
THERAPIST: Because it doesn't seem like it occurs to you in the moment to ask him, "what do you think is bothering you?"
CLIENT: Right. And I think that I definitely like, I'll kind of get to that place, but it's once I'm really angry and that it's more like fighting like, I really don't think you're mad about this, I think you're mad because I couldn't do it instead of more, I don't know. 
[00:27:02]
I think, you know, if someone approaches me like that, I cannot let, you know, kind of blazing and defensive, too. So then, that just makes it worse. So yeah. And I don't know why it's such a problem because then, well, we have had like some conversations for like after a fight about me saying like I felt like, you know, I don't like when you question my motivations and how I think that like he needs to have everything like match to his level, and I think like, I don't know, like that really could be a problem, and he seems very unhappy when he's in that situation.
So, knowing me and how I am, if he knows that I don't operate like that, I feel like, don't know, putting me within a situation to like where you're always going to be upset with me because I'm not going to, almost like my roommate. So, if they're not aware of keeping the house clean all the time, like for me to except that of them, is, I mean, just don't think of it or care that, I don't know [inaudible 0:28:18] always going to be upset with him.
[00:28:26]
And that's how I felt last night, kind of like well, you know I don't think like you, and you know, get to the same place in a different way. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_23922');">[note]</a><div id="_note_23922" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>The extent to which she experiences her boyfriend as her unappeasable father is striking. It could have been helpful for me to have commented on this.</b></div> So, if you're going to get upset about that, like, I don't know what to do with that. So, I think I recognize it on some level that it's his issue, but it's still [inaudible 0:28:51]. And I don't know if that's because I worked to like control the situations or if it's me that, and I'll have a way of like handing it, or I don't know.
[00:29:06]
THERAPIST: Well, it seems like you're not sure whether his expectations are valid. On the one hand, you're feeling like what are you talking about? And the other hand, you really want to live up to them. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_24671');">[note]</a><div id="_note_24671" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>She is talking about wanting to placate him and I'm drawing her attention to the fact that she has a difficult time placating her inner voice.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. Well, so when he talks about the subject of like trying and motivation, I do think that there is always a better way of doing something, you can always do something differently, and next time I learn from it. But I think he obsesses over it. So, then I end up feeling like well yeah, I tried my best, like on my free time that I had and I looked, and I called and whatever. And then, I feel like I start to over-think the situation because I'm like could I have called when I was making dinner or taking a–I don't know, I started thinking of these extreme, well to me, they feel like extreme situations to like create some time to do something. I don't know. And that's where I feel like, like I felt like I did...
[00:30:18]
And then, I feel like it's this huge issue. So, I felt that I did everything within reason to make it [inaudible 0:30:24] to find a new doctor in the last couple days. You know, could I have, I don't know. But skip something at work to create ten minutes free time? Like, yeah. I'm sure I could've done that but–and I feel like I'm justifying myself like right now. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_25978');">[note]</a><div id="_note_25978" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This was a good self-observation.</b></div> But I didn't really have the time to do that, so I feel like within reasonable measures, like yeah, I did. But then, I started to think should I have–I don't know, been like superwoman and been able to do that.
[00:30:58]
So...yeah. So, I feel like I know, like, I don't know, what my expectations are, but then like, I don't know, like when I guess myself, I can start to think like what could I have, you know, done something differently and–like last night, I didn't get out of work until like 6:30, and so, they were closed already. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_26596');">[note]</a><div id="_note_26596" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is about the 10th time she used the word closed in the session.</b></div>
THERAPIST: What if you didn't try at all and just asked Jamie basically walk you through it. 
CLIENT: I think he would. And that–well, and that's another thing, too, I feel like if I had asked him, I think he would've helped me in a heartbeat. I feel like me trying to do it myself almost like made the situation worse because I wanted to do it myself, and then, I couldn't do it, and then, he had to do it. So, I don't know if he had to. So, I don't know if he was like–I think like his personality, like he wants to feel, I don't know, like important, or maybe like needed. 
[00:32:17]
So, maybe it bothered him that I had looked without his help in the first place. I don't know. And then, like, his irrational–[inaudible 0:32:36] but then, his irrational side kicked in, and then, I don't deal with people very irrational well. And I felt like I started harping on the words so that he was just like, he was like–we had talked about the doctor that I'm seeing and he–like when he gets angry, I feel like he just forgets what he says. And so, I'm like no, you said this. And then, it was a perfect example of me trying to rationalize with him last night.
[00:33:09]
Because I feel like he's getting angry at me over things that we already discussed and made a decision on. But I think that's...I think at that point, I was–I didn't get too into the fight with him if he's irrational, and kind of just went away from that because I didn't feel like that there was a point when, I don't know, arguing over [inaudible 0:33:36]. But...I don't know what ticked him to make him so upset. 
And now, thinking about I don't know if it's because I didn't go to him in the first place if he's upset about it, or if it's like I really couldn't meet his expectation of doing something fast enough for him or I don't know, what he thought was very easy, I did not in that situation.
[00:34:09]
And then, I defend myself and then I'm just like defending myself like, do you not see the insurances listed there? Like, mine isn't listed. And can you see how that would be confusing? And he like he didn't get it either. But yeah, he did make a couple comments like what would you do without me? Would you have even been able to find the doctor? Like well yes, I would've called when I had the time. But I don't know. 
And I don't know if it worries him that I couldn't do it for myself, so if he needs help, I'm not going to be able to help him. 
THERAPIST: Do you think that's part of it? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29278');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29278" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>She's beginning to express curiosity about her boyfriend's mental and emotional state which signals her moving to a more reflective space. My comment is intended to encourage her to continue doing so. When patients move become more reflective in a session, that also indicates that they are less anxious.</b></div>
[00:35:02]
CLIENT: I think it could be. Yeah. Like, if he needs something done for him, you know, will I be able to do it? And then, that's what's like annoying with me because I feel like I really am like motivated to figure something out, it just may not take as little time as it takes him. And like I feel like [inaudible 0:35:27] not trial and error, but if I don't know something, like I just explore it and that's where I get my knowledge from it. And then, he or somebody that takes a little bit more time, he can look at something and it's like, you know, bam, he knows it. 
So, I feel like maybe I can see why, I don't know, he–I don't know. I guess he just doesn't want to wait for anybody. So, I'm like well if you needed something, I would figure it out, but maybe it wouldn't be as quick as you want.
[00:36:07]
So, [pause].
THERAPIST: So, do you think it makes him anxious that someone would need him or need to rely on him? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_30610');">[note]</a><div id="_note_30610" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>When people have issues with control, it often masks fears about need and dependency. In this intervention, I'm less interested in "A"'s boyfriend's feelings around need and more interested in introducing the issue of need into the session.</b></div>
CLIENT: I don't–no. I don't think so. [Pause] I feel like he would almost...like he's made comments before on how he thinks like I just operate individually, so I think he wants me to rely on him more. I don't think that it's, that he–that it's like anxious about that [inaudible 0:36:57].
THERAPIST: Maybe. And then, I'm wondering if he's conflicted because it doesn't sound like–in this situation, he's actually encouraging you to ask questions. 
[00:37:06]
CLIENT: Right. Well, and then, I feel like his whole–and then, I end up getting angry and be like well, at least give me feedback on me. Like, your bedside manner is like, it's not horrible but the way in which he'll motivate someone to do something is not like encouraging. It's almost like he shows you well, well, it's almost like my dad but my dad is more mean, but that's just more me, but he'll show you his dissatisfaction and then, he kind of like well, why wouldn't you want to change that?
So, instead of getting someone to be like well, that's a good way, maybe I could try it next time. Or whatever you end up feeling bad that you couldn't do it. And then, that's really not motivating. So, yeah. I feel like that's his like weird way of like welcoming something like that. Although, it doesn't feel very welcoming something, but it doesn't feel very welcoming. 
[00:38:09]
THERAPIST: How does it feel to talk about it now, right here? 
CLIENT: Hmm. I feel like I can–I don't know. If I kind of like step back and think about it, I feel like maybe I'm not as upset and it will make it easier for me to talk to him about some of these issues. But I don't know. I feel like some of his issues, like he can't–he doesn't say what he means. Like, it comes out and I don't know if passive aggressive is the word because it's not, but just like in other like types of ways. 
So, instead of–like I truly believe that he would like for me to like rely on him more because I do, do things alone that are very kind of private. But I think the way he, like, tries to ask for that is just by making me upset. Or the result is just making me upset. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_33075');">[note]</a><div id="_note_33075" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>There was a problem with the audio recording and the last several minutes were not recorded.
