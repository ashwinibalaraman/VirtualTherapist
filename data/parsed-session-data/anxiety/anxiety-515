BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>PT:</b>	So she, um, and I had her in the week before in the emergency room, um, because she was having problems with, uh, bleeding in her intestines, intestinal tract.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh God.
<b>PT:</b>	They figured that out and then, um, like the nursing, um, the nursing staff [INAUDIBLE] didn't know if she had had another stroke and that's why she was non responsive, and, um, but my Mom's laying in bed most of the day.  That's not her.  She likes to get up and get around and even though she was wheelchair bound, she still managed to go all over the place, and, um, I know her last thing [INAUDIBLE] giving up, not giving up, but, um, I think she just feels it's time.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and she's how old?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE].  She's always been independent and active and since the stroke, she's just gotten, she's bored all the time.  She, she just is, um, well I knew that there was something going, we took her out to dinner at the Olive Garden, and, um, she didn't eat a bite of what she ordered, but she also didn't drink her brandy and water.  She always has a brandy and water when we go out to dinner and, um—
<b>DR:</b>	So she wasn't feeling well.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.  I said I figured if she didn't touch that something was wrong.  Um, so—
<b>DR:</b>	So did they figure out the cause of the bleeding for her?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, she was on ibuprofen.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, so yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah and they just took her off of that and she's been okay since then as far as that goes, um, and—
<b>DR:</b>	I imagine her hemoglobin was pretty low too.
<b>PT:</b>	Hemoglobin was low.  She protein deficiency is what they also decided because she hasn't been eating.  So she's taking Ensure, um, protein drink, and, uh, but she's also gotten very, her dementia has gotten worse.  Um, she still recognizesme and the kids and my husband, but she's real confused and, um, you know, like she'll ask the other day what time is lunch and then she'll ask it again a few minutes later, and, um, so it's, it's really strange for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Now when she had, did she lose consciousness when this happened?  I mean did they find her?
<b>PT:</b>	They had just put her in her wheelchair.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Gotten her dressed and put her in her wheelchair and then all of a sudden she was just non responsive.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so she was, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, sometimes when people, especially when their hemoglobin's really low—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, they can get a little bit anoxia.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	In the brain and—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And in the elderly what we find many times like with surgery, people have anesthesia and even though they—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Are really oxygenated, there's enough lack of oxygen in the brain—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It kills off just enough—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Of the cells that when people come out they recognize that there's a difference in the individual's ability to think and process and remember.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and that happens with quite a bit of regularity [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So you might see that difference because of her just losing consciousness.
<b>PT:</b>	Sure, okay.  I never thought of that because I know her personality since her stroke has changed and that I didn't find surprising.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and in fact, when she was in the hospital, she seemed more upbeat and less frustrated than she had been before that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So, she, she just doesn't like having to be dependent.  Um, she always, she had ballroom danced before and played golf and she was always volunteering at the college and so I think that being that active, she just is extremely frustrated.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, anyway, that, that's on top of school.  So, um, I don't know if you've talked to [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, she hasn't mentioned anything to me.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay because I, I, um, am applying for an FLMA, or, um, leave, um.  I'm in a new school again this year, and basically I started out, I'm doing elementary PE, and I thought before school started even though I was apprehensive that this would be kind of a fun change, I can't function at all.  Um, I go daily with that panic and anxiety feeling.  Um, I know I, I typed up a bunch of the way I felt, um, and gave it to [NAME OTHER].  She put it, it's things like, um, I brought the paperwork, um, because I, I thought she was going to talk to you, but, um, it's, you know, basically I, I think it's like stress from never being in the same school more than one year in a row, and, um, uh, I can't think.  I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	And there you have it, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I'm just distracted, um.
<b>DR:</b>	Is, is that what you've been experiencing during class?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah.  Um, I can't remember kid's names.  I can't remember what I'm doing some days.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Now was this going on during the summer or no?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.  I think I've come to the realization that I don't think I can be in the classroom anymore.  Um, I thought, you know, that, like I said, I thought being a different age group and a different subject, um, I'd be okay and the first day obviously I was nervous, but it hasn't changed.  I just—
<b>DR:</b>	Now do you feel like there's a difference between FMLA and medical leave?
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	FMLA is, um, a situation where you would continue working and you may need to take some time off periodically due to one's health condition.  Whereas medical leave is a situation where people just can't do their job and need to be off work.
<b>PT:</b>	And so I'm guessing than a medical leave.
<b>DR:</b>	Might be more appropriate.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I know that, I talked to our union rep.  Um, and well she, she told me to pick up the paperwork.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you have there?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, that and then she told me to apply for our sick leave pool.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, what this will allow you to do is, um, and they're two different things.  Medical leave is a situation where you, in theory, if you have like short term or a long term disability.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Allowing you time off work where you are not working—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	For medical reasons.  FMLA, in my understanding of it is, because I'm no attorney, thank God, is a situation where your job's protected as long as you're actively being treated—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Or as long as you have a, um, diagnosed medical condition—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Such that you don't lose your job if you have to miss work because of the medical condition or because you have to keep an appointment.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But it's generally for people who are, um, continuing to actively be employed.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	People can have both going on.  I mean you can have an FMLA which covers you for like a 6 month or a year period of time.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And then have medical leave intermittently through that.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So, but if you feel like you need time, that you aren't capable of doing the job due to health reasons, um, then we're looking at a, in addition to this—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	A medical leave and that's—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's a different set of paperwork too.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and I know that, um, that our, [NAME OTHER] is our union rep and, or business agent and she said apply for the sick leave pool and apply for the disability that, that we get through [DEIDENTIFIED].  Um, and, um, but she just said that, that it has to be very specifically worded as like a chronic condition or, or, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Well long standing condition with acute, an acute episode.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And that it's not just treatable by medication only and, um, and I just, I can't think [INAUDIBLE] and this is the paperwork that goes with applying for the sick leave pool.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that, you do have both paperwork?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, um, here my brain goes again.  Um, I, I, I guess I'm, I'm, I feel like I can't deal with a classroom situation.  I, I got through last year just by looking at it as a day at a time, and this year's it's just like I feel like I can't cope and I've lost all my coping skills.  Um, and part of it is I feel like the district has used and abused us plopping, plopping us in a new situation or plopping me at least, in a new situation every year.  Um, and I know I'm not the only one feeling the stress, but at the union last week they had a guy come in who had been placed and, um, he was having a tough, tough time coping and he had a heart attack and died at the union, um, hall last week.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my God.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and one of the guys [INAUDIBLE] teaching with had a heart attack and he died, and I'm just going I don't need this, but yeah, I, I just feel like I, I just can't do it, and I don't know if I'm even making sense.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, given your history—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And we've talked about this—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So many times and it's, at some point, it was going to impact you in some way.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's just [INAUDIBLE] around and around and you're here and there and—
<b>PT:</b>	And I, and I've been skirting the issue.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I know I said I, I've been good at covering up my feelings.  Um, covering up the stress and just biting my lip and going through it.  Um, I said I don't know if it's my stoic Swedish, um, because my mother used to, I never saw my Mom angry until, she and my Dad never fought, um, and I think it was just her, her way of coping with, it's easier to keep quiet than to create a—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's, that's Norwegian lifestyle though.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Keep quiet and very stoic.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, [INAUDIBLE] angry with her stroke [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well and that might be, that's probably more related to the stroke.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  Um, I said if she put up with me as a teenager being calm.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, I'll need to make a copy of this.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay and that's the other one.
<b>DR:</b>	And how about as far as the medications.  Let me just—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Go through that with you.  You're still on the Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The 1 and a half.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Wellbutrin 3?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And the, uh, Ambien?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	And you take that every night?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I, I haven't been able to sleep without it.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you, are you able to sleep with it?
<b>PT:</b>	Most nights, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I know [NAME OTHER] will come and get me to go to bed because I will sit out in the living room and just either work on my computer or, because I'm, I'm still teaching online.
<b>DR:</b>	And would you, is that through the school?
<b>PT:</b>	Not through [DEIDENTIFIED], no.
<b>DR:</b>	So that's all—
<b>PT:</b>	Totally—
<b>DR:</b>	And is that something that you feel you're able to still do?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I think so.  I know I've been stressed out enough lately that it hasn't even interested me.  Um, and I know with this sick leave pool and with disability, I can't be working anywhere else I guess.  I don't know.  Um, but I managed well enough last year and it was I think mainly because I'm not having to do classroom management.  I feel like I'm actually teaching.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, I'm trying to think, and now this is, I don't know if you want to look at this.
<b>DR:</b>	So have you been working up till now?
<b>PT:</b>	Up till today, yeah.  Um, I know I told [DEIDENTIFIED] teaching, I said today's my, or yesterday was my last day.  I just can't do it anymore, but I don't know if you want to look at this too.
<b>DR:</b>	Are these together?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Those two are together.  The other one is through the MLA.
<b>DR:</b>	FMLA?
<b>PT:</b>	FMLA packet.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] go through this.
<b>PT:</b>	So I feel like, I mean I can't remember what I go into another room for.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think taking the time off work will help in and of itself with reducing the anxiety or do you think we need to prescribe something to help reduce it?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, that one I'm not sure of.  I feel a lot less anxious just getting up this morning.  Um, I know that, that going, going to work I feel anxiety, but I, I don't know.  I hadn't thought about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Now do you think this has gotten worse since, did you go to the generic Wellbutrin XL?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Has your anxiety been worse since being on that?
<b>PT:</b>	I, I don't think so.  I, I know that we talked about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I've seen a lot of, about 25% of people have been having problems with it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I, well I just started it.  It was when I refilled it the last time.  That would have been August.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's usually about 3 or 4 weeks after people make the switch had symptoms.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So I, I would actually prefer to get you back on brand name just to make sure—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	We aren't complicating this to a side effect of the med.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Um, because I, I know we talked about that, and I guess I didn't put two and two together.  I know last year at school, I would refer to certain days as like well this was a Valium day.  I was that, ah—And I know one thing, I've noticed teaching on the north side, which is where they put me this year, um, I'm off of [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED], um, I didn't know 1st graders could be so naughty.  I've written 3 referrals on 1st graders for fighting or like threatening each other.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you, uh, have changes every year, or is it every—
<b>PT:</b>	Every year.  This is, um—
<b>DR:</b>	I know every year since I've seen you, it's been an issue, but—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  The last time I was in I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] for 3 years.  In '99 I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] my first year.  So 2000 through the 2003, I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] and every year since then I've been in a new school, and of those, well this is my 9th school in 7 years.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you even have changes within the school year?
<b>PT:</b>	Well they put at 2 schools at once.
<b>DR:</b>	Two schools, right, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I know that it takes about 3 years to build a rapport with students in a school, and I don't even, I find myself distancing myself from the kids because I don't want to get attached.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well I did put a note on this.  You know, they asked about voc rehab and that might not be a bad thing.
<b>PT:</b>	What kind, what?
<b>DR:</b>	Vocational rehab.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, oh.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, meaning to take a look at some options, opportunities.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and I, you know, they ask is there any particular, what are the obstacles to return to work and it's basically multiple jobs and multiple classroom changing each year.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's the obstacle and if you continue that pattern it's just going to continue for you.  Um, what I'd like to do is just not do anything with the medications.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And just see if by taking the time off work, with the exception of getting you back on the brand name Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and seeing if that will help.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and stabilize because I, I have seen people get pretty anxious and—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Irritable and, um, they just don't feel right and they feel more depressed.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So I want to get back on the, uh, brand name within a week or 2 when your mood evens out.
<b>PT:</b>	That's—
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	You think they'd be the same, but—
<b>DR:</b>	No, they, well that's, that's a whole different discussion, but they're not the same, um, and this one in particular, we've really had some difficulties with it.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's really interesting.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So, are you getting it at a local pharmacy or the mail order?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, through [DEIDENTIFIED], um, on [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Let's see what we have here.
<b>PT:</b>	The yellow sheet I know goes to the insurance company, um, that covers the sick leave pool and the disability.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm going to make copies of these and I'm going to give them, you're going to give them to yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You send them to whomever you need them to go to, and then, um, I did send over a prescription.  I just did it for a month—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Just to make sure—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That in fact it makes a difference.  If it does, then we'll do the 90 day thing again.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All righty, and then do you have an appointment set up to see me next?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.  I don't.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  They're going, I know my schedule's pretty packed, so they're going to squeeze you in somewhere.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	In the next, uh, 3 or 4 weeks and—
<b>PT:</b>	I was going to ask you, I thought I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Is he new here?
<b>DR:</b>	Um, to [DEIDENTIFIED], no.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But their clinic at [DEIDENTIFIED] shut down.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay because I, I know—
<b>DR:</b>	Because he was at [DEIDENTIFIED] with me a long time ago.
<b>PT:</b>	I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] many years ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And—
<b>DR:</b>	He and I have gone through a couple of clinic closures together, so.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I thought gee, he looks familiar and then I heard him say his name to a patient and I thought I know him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, I will meet you up front with this.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, see you back in a couple of weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.
