BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: [Adjusts microphone]
CLIENT: Oh, I'm sorry. [Chuckles] [Sounds as if getting adjusted] Thank you so much for that referral.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: That was so helpful.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Um, I haven't spoken to her yet, but, [drops something] um — 'cause Chris's says [this does not come out] (ph) of his insurance. Uh, [pauses] but [yawns] I'm very [shifts in seat] happy. Um...
THERAPIST: Well, what might be help — I mean, you could certainly set up a consult...
CLIENT: Call beforehand - absolutely.
THERAPIST: ...Time to — before you free that up. She had mentioned — I think she's going to be away the first week in July, something like that.
CLIENT: OK. [Continues to fidget]
THERAPIST: So — but she should be here for a week or so at the very least. [00:00:50]
CLIENT: That's good. Um, [clucks] so I was trying to think last night about, um, [pauses] just about leaving and about — uh, mostly about, like, how I've progressed since coming here in - [slaps surface] I guess it was at the end of November, [clucks] and it just like — it is hard — I always have a hard time doing stuff like that, just in my head. Like I have to — that's why I came here, because I could — I couldn't just sort things out in my head, and I don't trust my gut a lot of times, and so what I've realized is that I need to —
What I've realized is two things: I trust my gut more because that's one of the things that's changed, but I also just am a person that needs to talk things out more than once, even though that's not what I want to do. I don't [chuckles] want to talk things out more than once. I want to talk about it kind of for a long time, usually, and then I want to not [chuckles] talk about it anymore. [00:02:04]
[Sniffles] [Clucks] Um, [pauses] but anyway, so, you know, that's the reason why I started coming 'cause I just — and that's what I was feeling, like, last night — like I was just thinking about it, and I was thinking, like, "Well, what — you know, what were you like when you first started? And what are things like now? And what is the —" — and I just can't — like, I get too lost. I get — I get so sidetracked in my head even when I'm talking. It is a big problem, actually. [Chuckles] My siblings and Chris will get really irritated when I'm telling a story because I just get super sidetracked, and I'll go on [chuckles] a tangent for a while and forget where I started. But that — that's what happens in my head, like I can't just stay focused, on one line. Um, [clucks] so yeah. So I was trying to think about it, and I realized, like, "I'll just wait until tomorrow and think about it then." [Chuckles] Um, [drums hands on surface] so I guess [pauses] [takes sip of drink] like, when I first came, I felt awful all the time. [00:03:07]
All — all the time, [clucks] and I [pauses] — like, I don't know if I had a — anxiety disorder or [slaps surface] what. I mean, we never really talked about that in those kinds of terms, but I felt like I was in a state of panic almost constantly, and I know that's not normal [chuckles]. Like, that's not — I knew that I didn't want that to continue, so that's why I came, and it is — hasn't - it took a — a little while. Like, I came in expecting to come a couple times, like up at the gym, I guess. [Chuckles] Like, I get — I quit — like, I expected to come. This is how it was when I start to work out, too, really started to run. [00:04:00]
I would come and I'd be like, "Why [pauses] isn't this <i>better</i> yet? [Chuckles] Like, why isn't this [sniffles] <i>changed</i>?" And I remember one time I came, and I just had a complete meltdown. Do you remember that? I was like — I was saying — that's when we decided that we would up my sessions to twice a week. I was thinking I — just came, and I said, "I don't feel — I'm not doing this right. Like, I'm not doing —" — I think that was just a weird day. That wasn't — but [pauses] I don't know - I [sighs] [pauses] I felt better in a way that, all of the sudden one day, I would start to realize that — you're — "I'm feeling less anxious. Like, I'm not feeling this, like, continual anxiety of, like, [sighs] [clucks] um, like the — my throat's closing, and like I'm having chest pain, and I'm having — and I'm dizzy, and —"...[00:05:02]
[Sniffles] Uh, I've noticed that lessening, and then as soon as I would notice [snaps] it wasn't — I didn't have it all the time, I would be anxious again. And that cycle continued for a while until, eventually, it just wasn't there. And I'm just — and, now, it comes in waves. Like, I have — the other — on Monday, I was really anxious all day, and I just — but I knew what it was about, and I knew I had more tools to [sniffles] — to cope with it, and I knew I just needed to cry. Like, I sometimes wouldn't let myself get upset because I didn't think that it was things that I should be upset about. But [sniffles] I put the kids down for a nap, and I called Chris, and I just cried for a few minutes. And even though it didn't go away, I wasn't — I was still a little bit on edge, but I could work myself down in a way that I didn't used — I didn't have the tools for before. [00:05:58]
I just [pauses] — I would go to a different place with it; I would focus on the anxiety instead of focusing on what I was upset about and what I was worried — and why was I worried about these things? And why was it making me so anxious? And what about these situations is making me tense instead of focusing on the anxiety and having it being like, [inhales] you know, making the anxiety make me more anxious. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Fidgets] So I was able to do that and just, um, [pauses] — for them, and I could [feel then — then I'd get really free] (ph), but, of course, it is [a good that it] (ph) [sniffles] — the nearly free, leaving here and not still working with you is going to make me — not make it come back because — [clucks] but, like, I rely on coming here to keep me [sniffles] kind of [becomes emotional] [chuckles] regular?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:07:00]
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [sounds emotional] and that just makes me nervous. I'm also just really - you know, my gut instinct really started was [sniffles] [becomes emotional] — like, I want to just work through this. You weren't pushing; like, I was nervous that people were going to say, "You should just take some anti-anxiety medication. You should just take some antidepressants. You should just —" - and maybe I should have and maybe it would have helped me, but I'm — I'm — where I am right now, I'm happy that I didn't [pauses] just because I would have felt like — I always would have thought I didn't do it on my — not on my own but, like, I know that I — my — just myself, I have the ability to help myself and make myself better on my own, without anything else. [00:07:58]
And maybe, one day, I — I'm not saying, like, I'd never want to take an anti-anxiety medication/I'd never want to take an antidepressant, but I know, certainly, that I could do it on my own. And that, for me, was what I wanted; I wanted to show myself that I didn't, um, [pauses] [rubs hands] that I didn't need any — I didn't need to take any pill, [sniffles] I guess. And, obviously, you've helped me, but, you know, it — it felt like something that I — I could do and there wasn't — I don't know. I [don't want to take this] (ph). [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: When people have been so hurt through much — have been through so much in their childhood, it is especially difficult to depend or to want to depend on anybody.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And that sense of vulnerability and the possibility of being hurt are even exploited or misused is so intense, and the risks feel so high... [00:09:02]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...To depend on anybody.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, even if it is a pill.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, a pill, a person, anything...
CLIENT: [Sniffles] Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...That challenges your sense of self-sufficiency.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah, absolutely. I'm so not good at that. I still don't, like — I don't know how to say it, but [pauses] I still don't picture my life as, like [pauses] — like, I still see things as just me, like just me going through on my own. Like, I don't see it as, like — like, I have to remind myself that I have a partner who's supposed to be like — I'm — because he does; he's great at supporting me. He — like, I call him, and he drops everything. Again, on Monday, he said, "I'll be with — I'll leave school and come be with you if you need me to." [00:10:02]
And, like, I don't — but I don't <i>see</i> that; it is just like I just see, [pauses] like, <i>me</i> [pauses] on my — oh, like, on my own, I guess. And then I'm always surprised when I call him, and I'm upset, and he's so comforting. Um, [pauses] I don't know. I think that's what makes it harder for me when we — when we move and things like that, because I [clucks] do still have this feeling of, like, just me here, on my own, doing this and going. [Sniffles] And, like, I don't see <i>him</i>. I don't know. [Fidgets] [Pauses] But — [pauses] [fidgets] — mm — ew — [sounds like wiping something] [continues to fidget] [00:11:02]
I just don't cry nearly [chuckles] so much when I come here anymore. [Sniffles] [Slaps surface] Uh, like, I used to come, I used to walk in the door, and I would sit down, and I would just start crying, and I would cry for 45 minutes, and I — I just wouldn't [slaps surface] stop. Um, it was like it was built up, and I just needed to come and feel like this was like somewhere that I could just cry and feel OK about that. It was like [sniffles] — [clucks] I think there is being told that I was — I was being told I was emotional. I was being told that, like, I was sensitive and, um — and I was feeling sorry for myself, that I shouldn't cry about certain things, and that, if I'm feeling upset, I shouldn't cry about it. And so I just — I think it is — I don't know if it is a good thing that I don't [becomes emotional] [chuckles in exasperation] cry as much anymore. I take it as a good sign that I don't feel the need to come here and just sob. Um, I feel like it is at least a little — I don't know — I also just don't think it is a bad thing that I'm a person who cries, and I used to. I used to have a lot of — not like a bad thing, but I used to be kind of embarrassed about it. [00:12:20]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And — I don't know — it just doesn't make — it just — but still, I guess, what if I cried in front of my whole family at dinner or something. But [pauses] I don't know. Like, it even set — something happened a couple months ago. I was in an argument with one of my brothers, [pauses] and my brother said, [clears throat] "Oh, my God, are you <i>cry</i>ing?" And I just said, "Yeah, I cry; that's what I do. I'm emotional. I'm upset and I'm frustrated right now, and when I feel that way, I cry. It's not that big of a deal." [00:13:03]
And I just wouldn't have had the guts to say that before. Like, I would have felt like that's an insult, because he meant it. He meant it as a jab, but I just didn't take it as one. Like, "This is just how I process it. This is just how I deal with it. I'm frustrated. I'm pissed. I'm upset. I'm going to cry. [Sniffles] Tough. [Chuckles] [Slaps surface] Like, it doesn't need to bother you." Um, I don't know — so that was — that's definitely new. [Pauses] I think just, in general, just being more OK with myself. There are still some huge things, obviously, but just, in general, like, I just feel more confident and I feel — which was a big thing that I wanted. And that [pauses] — I don't know. [Fidgets] [Shifts in seat] [00:14:03]
Your approach in here, in these sessions is to not say much, or at least maybe that's just with me. But — and, at first, it made me really uncomfortable, and I would — 'cause I have a lot of self-doubt...
THERAPIST: [Faintly] Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And I just don't — and I need to be able to read people, and I need to be able to — like, I need to be able to know what they're thinking. But I think coming here and having it just being me pretty much. It may not be — for a long time, I really focused on, like, [slaps surface] [chuckles] trying to read you and trying to work through it. "Hmm, [clucks] what does that mean? What does this mean?" And, at a certain point, I just stopped doing that — not really stopped because I didn't [mutters] [inaudible at 14:56] going to shut off, but it just didn't matter as much; it just mattered more what I was saying and what I was thinking about things, [slaps surface] and I think that was one of the biggest things that helped me to feel more confident - was just like, "Well, what do <i>you</i> think?" - because I don't stop to do that much [slaps surface]. I don't — I'm — I don't stop to think — I'm so focused on, like, [inhales] in this situation, I act this way for this person, or read this person, and I just [slaps surface] should be relying more on my gut and my — I don't know. It was really helpful. It was really nice, um, and not what I would have come into this experience thinking I'd — I'd want.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I would have thought I [slaps surface] — I would have said, like, "I need a lot of [chuckles] feedback. I need a lot of, like —" — but I think that's what I want and not necessarily what I need. [00:16:05]
And, um, like I'd preferred that somebody just have a constant stream of telling me what they saw about me. That would be [chuckles] totally comforting for me. That would feel delightful. I would feel like — but that's just not helpful.
THERAPIST: What would feel delightful about it?
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Um, that [pauses] — I don't know. I've always had to — well, these conversations I actually had recently with my friends. [Clucks] Um, I said - I believe in total honesty and just — I don't trust other people, and I don't trust what they're telling me about myself, ever. And, um, [pauses] I don't know why a negative thing would seem like something I could trust, but it does. Um... [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: So I'd be saying negative things?
CLIENT: Like, [chuckles] yeah, probab — not negative, like constructive. Like, um — like, [clucks] it sounds like — this is you talking — "It sounds like you need to, you know — like you need to do this or —" — um, or, "It sounds like you're" — I don't know [slaps surface]. I don't know, but yet I would trust, like, constructive criticism.
THERAPIST: Well, I've a couple of thoughts.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yes?
THERAPIST: One thought is, the times I've done that, you've not liked it...
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...Like, times where, like, I — the nanny-sharing...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...The Chicago trip.
CLIENT: Oh, I liked that.
THERAPIST: Did you?
CLIENT: Yes. I react negatively, but I did actually — I thought it was really helpful for me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Sorry I interrupted you.
THERAPIST: No, no, not at all. That's helpful to know.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I mean, to me — I tend to be — I like to listen. [00:18:00]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I like — I think — I don't like to make presumptions about what's going on in someone else's mind; I want to know.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Um, I always feel like I give more feedback than people say. I give feedback [chuckles]. I feel like I give them a lot of feedback, but...
CLIENT: No, you definitely — the times you give feedback, it is impactful because I feel like I have a constant stream of thought that happens for 45 minutes, and I feel like you'll interject a couple times, and when it happens, I know it is meant to, like, draw me someplace or like —or to think about something else maybe a little differently.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so it makes a difference.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Clucks] But, yeah, I know that I react in a way that seems like — trust me, this is a big complaint of— of Chris's — I react in a way that seems like I'm pissed, because I usually am pissed. The nanny-sharing thing, I was pissed about. I did have a really hard time with that. [00:19:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, um, that's a whole separate thing because I'm already really, um — I'm also just insecure about my job and what it is, and I always take it as, like — I just am already insecure about that whole situation. [Pauses] [Clucks] Yeah. But, yeah, I was saying to my friends recently, "I would prefer [chuckles] everybody is just always completely honest, too. Like, I would prefer everyone was just blunt [slaps surface]."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And, uh, my girlfriend said to me a couple weeks later — she's like, "I think you use that sometimes as a crutch to just say whatever you want."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: "Like, sometimes, you just say, like, 'I'm just being honest', but you use it as a crutch to say mean things, and you just go about it as if, like, 'I'm just being honest'." [00:20:01]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I said, "That's absolutely true," because it is. It is absolutely true. And, [rubs something], um, it is something [pauses] that I want to change. [Pauses] I do wish [people were] (ph) honest to me, but [chuckles] [usually like awful] (ph). I know that's — like, I know that I say that, and I probably wouldn't want it in real life. I say it and I just — but, ah — you know, like, Chris was complimenting me on something the other day. [Tuesday or Wednesday] (ph), we were all sitting around having dinner or something and chatting, and Chris was complimenting me on my — he says I — he sends a lot of things to me to proofread and to, you know, give him feedback on, and he says that I have really — that I'm a good writer and that I have a good writing style. And Emma said afterwards — said I was saying, like, "No, no." [00:21:00]
Because, in my head, I'm like, "He only sends me that stuff to check, for OCD stuff." Like, I don't believe him when he says that he's — he's taking — like, he doe; he takes my advice when I give it to him on writing, but I always think it is kind of out of pity, and I'm always certain that he goes back afterwards and changes it. I've never, like, [chuckles] checked, but I'm sure that has happened. And so Emma said, at the table, I was physically — physically recoiling as he was complimenting me to the point where I had turned my body completely away from him [slaps surface] as he was trying to compliment me. Like, I was so un — I was just so uncomfortable, and I just didn't believe it. Like, to me, he was lying to our friends [chuckles] and, like, trying to make me something that I wasn't to our friends, and it made me so uncomfortable. I couldn't even listen to the conversation, like I had to turn away, and I just couldn't even listen to it. [00:21:58]
Um, [pauses] [slaps surface] it would have felt much more natural for him to say something harsh and critical, and that would have felt like something I could have accepted and handled. I would have definitely — if he had said, like, [rubs something] [chuckles] I don't know — like, "Jenny needs to lose a good ten pounds," I would have felt like, "Oh, yeah, she does. [Clucks] Got that one right." Like, that one would have felt a lot more natural to me, or something like that.
THERAPIST: Because it reflects how you think and feel about yourself?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, I guess so because, to me, that's true. And so [pauses] when someone says something that's supposed to be nice, it is just not true. Like, it is just not — like, I will — I just won't ever [chuckles] think it is — I think they're full of shit and that they're just, like, throwing me a bone, um, and that's something I guess I still need to work on. That's something I still really want to work on. [00:23:07]
THERAPIST: Well, and one of the problems — it prevents you from learning anything new. You only learn what you already know.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [Fidgets]
THERAPIST: But taking in - information that doesn't immediately feel familiar is not taken in.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, that's true. Yeah, [rubs something] I didn't think of it that way. [Sighs] [Pauses for 11 seconds] Something I also do less of, but that hasn't gone away and I want to just keep working on is relating everything back to how that would make me measure up to being like or being different from my dad or my grandmother, or anyone on my dad's side of the family. [00:24:03]
I still — like, it used to kind of be the measuring stick. It doesn't happen as much, but it is definitely still there. Like, when you just said that, I thought, like, [says softly] "Just like my <i>dad</i>." That's what I thought immediately, which is good. Like, I don't think that should go away, but it shouldn't be the first thing I think, right?
THERAPIST: I'm sorry. What is just like your dad?
CLIENT: Um, not taking in new information as, like — just not being able to take in a different perspective or a different point of view, or, um, [pauses for seven seconds] [clucks] not, [pauses] I guess, seeing a reality that isn't his own. And I think sometimes that I don't see a reality that isn't <i>my</i> own. [00:25:11]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses for seven seconds] so that felt (ph) some more. [Clears throat] [Pauses for five seconds] Hmm. [Slaps surface] [Makes squirrel-like sound] <i>Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch</i>. [Shifts in seat] I don't know. [Pauses] I, uh, [pauses for eight seconds] I felt like, when I started coming here, also, I wasn't really angry anymore. Like I — I think I was still angry — I was angry at my mom, I think — and I'm angry at Caleb, or I was angry at Caleb. [00:26:08]
I wasn't really mad at my dad anymore, but I was certainly really sad. [Clucks] And, now, I don't think I'm really that sad anymore now that I'm — like, I used to be really sad about <i>him</i> and his life, and how he was liv — I — it is still really sad. He's still alone, by his own — because of his addictions and the way that he's treated people, and that — that's sad, but it doesn't have to make <i>me</i> sad. I mean, like, I should [slaps surface] feel empathetic towards him because of the way that he's [shifts in seat] — I — and I do, but it shouldn't be, like, something that drives me to put myself into situations that I <i>know</i> aren't good for myself and aren't — [and then I went to Florida] (ph), [chuckles] I guess. [00:27:02]
But you know, like, [rubs something] um — but to call him constantly even though - it is just a miserable production [slaps surface] of nothing really accomplished, and so I just don't do it anymore. I'll call him once a month, and it is fine. Like, I just don't — I don't have that need anymore to, like, [says animatedly] be checking in. "What's he doing, and how is he?" And, like, you know, if I talk to my brothers, and they've been around him, I ask how he is, but it used to be, like, um, a really big focal point, like right here [slaps surface] that just kind of sat there. [Takes in breath] Mm. [Sighs] [Pauses for nine seconds] I don't know. I guess, he's (ph) still kind of struggle with that a little bit.
THERAPIST: I'm sorry.
CLIENT: I said I think I just struggle with that a little bit. Um, [fidgets]... [00:28:02]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think one of your psychological projects...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm? [Fidgets]
THERAPIST: ...Is to really sort of confront all these fantasies you have about wanting a family that's, quote/unquote, "normal," which I imagine a part is loving and supportive, and to really try to — as painful as it is — come to terms with the family you have. Because, in a sense, you spend a lot of energy forcing — or you're sort of wanting to force them to be the kind of people you want them to be.
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I mean, understandably so, and it is like you keep — end up banging your head against a wall and being disappointed and angry.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And this is no easy task. [00:29:01]
CLIENT: No. Well, and I feel like part of that starts with talking to my mom about just — I don't know — at least for me, I think that starts with talking [slaps surface] to her about what — how I was hurt by her and how I felt. I don't know. Just in my experience with talking to my friends recently about — like, my girlfriends [slaps surface] from high school about how I felt really hurt by those certain situations, and it just helps me to kind of move on from that and to not really pigeonhole them in these [pauses] places that we were? I don't know. If I could feel at least a little bit similar — if that situation was any indication of, like, letting go and moving on, that could happen with my mom, that I just think that it something that needs to happen.[00:30:00]
[Clucks] But, yeah, I think part of it with me still forcing this [pauses] is just — yeah, the idea is that, [pauses] and — that I've had since I was, like — since I was a kid. [Fidgets] [Becomes emotional] <i>Hunhhh</i>. [Clears throat] It is also certainly what drives me to, like — I just want to have my own family, and I want it to be, like, lovely. And — but then that worries me. Am I, like, going to be just hugely disappointed if something isn't going to fit into my picture?
THERAPIST: [Faintly] Mm.
CLIENT: So I feel like it'd — yeah, [slaps surface] I need to kind of sort — there's a lot of little things I need to continue to just work through. [00:30:58]
THERAPIST: [Clucks] And it is complicated when there is a wish that — I mean, which I think, on some level, everybody has, that their own kids — you know, sort of, it will be a reparative experience.
CLIENT: It's so unhealthy
THERAPIST: You'll do things right, that you were — that wasn't done. You know, you'll be the different kind of parent.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Your child will be a different kind of child and give you that gratification. Which children, as you know, are very gratifying, but they're also their very...
CLIENT: They're their own people, yeah.
THERAPIST: They're their own people.
CLIENT: Absolutely. Well, and I just don't want to approach it that way. Like, I don't think that that's a healthy [pauses] way to enter [chuckles] into that next phase. I don't want it to be — like, they shouldn't carry any of my baggage. I know that that's impossible. I know everybody is going to take on something, but...
THERAPIST: That <i>is</i> impossible. And I'm not sure it is — I don't know anyone who doesn't, on some — you know, this could be a very unconscious level, not like, "I want my kid to be this and this and this to me..." [00:32:02]
CLIENT: Right. [Sniffles]
THERAPIST: ...But I think everyone, on some level, carries around this fantasy of having some reparative experience in their relationship with their kid, fantasies maybe they've dreamt of what the kid will provide - or their child will provide for them.
CLIENT: Mm.
THERAPIST: I think that that that, to some extent, is inescapable.
CLIENT: [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST: One's awareness of it and the limitations of that, I think, is what makes a difference.
CLIENT: Right. [Pauses] Yep. [Pauses for seven seconds] There's also — I mean, [sighs] yeah. There's just huge things that I do want to let go of beforehand, though.
THERAPIST: Hmm, I think you're well on your way. You've worked very hard in here. You work very hard.
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] [Becomes emotional] Thank you. [Shifts in seat] [Clucks] [00:33:04]
THERAPIST: I really see that in you. I recognize that in you.
CLIENT: [Says weakly] Thanks. [Shifts in seat] [Fidgets] [Begins to cry]
THERAPIST: It is very important to me to get you to someone good in New Hampshire, who will continue to help you — very important to me.
CLIENT: [Whispers] Thanks. [Continues to quietly cry] [Sighs] Yeah, I, uh, [pauses] — I feel good. I'm really grateful that this is [pauses] — you've helped me so much. I feel so much [sniffles] — I feel like a different person. I mean, not a different person because I don't want to be totally [chuckles] — but I feel like a much healthier version of myself. [Breathes in] This feels very good. [Rubs something] [Sniffles] [00:34:16]
[Silences for 16 seconds]
Now I've just got to get my marriage on the same track. [Sniffles] [Pauses] That's the other thing that I've kind of come to terms with, too, is that I just can't do the work for two people, whether it be my marriage or my relationship with my brother, or my friendships, or my relationship with my mom. Like, I can't do the work for two people. I can't, like you said, force people into these boxes that I've created for them. [00:35:04]
Because I do that; I put people — like, if it is not fitting into my box — like, I think that I can — I can either force them or do the work for us. Like, I had this idea when I came here that — well, I had the idea when I came here that I was the problem in my marriage, and that anything that [slaps surface] needed help, I could fix because of — because I was the problem, and that's just not the case. And I couldn't fix my brother by coming here. I couldn't fix, you know — I couldn't make him better. I don't know if he can make him better, but he has to try. Like, I can't try. I can't call him after I leave here and have him pick my brain about, like, what a session is [chuckles] is like for me because it is just not — you know, like, I just can't do that. [00:36:05]
[Sniffles] I [can't go on] (ph) for so many [chuckles] reasons. [Pauses] But that's been new. That was not something that I was OK with. But I feel like, for the amount that I don't rely on anybody else, or I don't feel comfortable, at least — I probably do rely on a lot of people for a lot of things, but I don't feel comfortable doing it. I feel extremely comfortable and have a desire for — I — like, I would prefer that everybody just come to me, and I would — I'd hate it. I'd feel like — I'd feel — what's the word I'm looking for?
THERAPIST: Guarded (ph)?
CLIENT: Thank you. Um, but, like, that makes sense to me. That's logical. That's like, "All right," just like, "all right, let's like sort this out, and let's go through it," but then it also feels like [slaps surface] crippling. [00:37:05]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But it makes sense, and that's [sniffles] — it also just feels comfortable. That feels like, "Yep, OK, [pauses] we should work it out this way, and let me tell you how. [Rubs something] But then, if you don't do, I'm going to be really [chuckles] upset." [Sniffles] [Fidgets] That's something that still needs work with my family and Chris but doesn't exist as much with my friends. Like Emma was just making some real crummy life decisions yesterday, but they're her life decisions to make. That's — she asked my advice, and I told her honestly, without — I was very — I was trying very hard to be tactful; [clucks] I think I was. She — she could tell that I didn't agree with it, but, um, they're her life choices to [chuckles] make. [00:38:03]
And if she wants to do that — it is all job-related. She just finished her master's program but just wants to — for teaching, but is just not going to use it, and she's going to nanny for the year, which is fi — like, if that's — but then apply to new jobs for nannying, and lied to a woman that she was — a potential employer who called her current employer, and kind of ratted Emma out. Emma got caught in a lie and decided to just stick with the job that she complains about constantly, every day — this nannying job. And I think, like — for me, I felt like, "You're miserable. You come home and complain every day, but this is your [chuckles] life choice. Like, I'm not going to sit here —" — She'd also told me earlier that day, on a play date, like, "I'm totally burnt out with these kids," [clucks] and then came home that night <i>so thrilled</i>, like, "They offered me full-time!" And just said to her, like — I congratulated her and then said, like, "Do you think that's, like, really what you want to do? Like, are - ?" — and she said, "Yeah." And I said, "It — I'm just saying 'cause, at noon today, you said you were totally [slaps surface] burnt out with this family." And she's, like, "I know, but they're offering me full-time." And so I just — like, it is just her life choice. [Sniffles] [00:39:19]
THERAPIST: What do you think bothered you about it?
CLIENT: [Clucks] It bothered me because there were — I saw a whole list of negatives. She had also painted this woman — the potential employer — to look like a lot — like a — like she had ratted Emma out, even though Emma had lied to both [slaps surface] the potential employer and her current employer. [Clucks] And so she wanted to, like, switch the blame. Oh, like, she had — she was saying, like, "Can you believe that woman?" And I was like — and I said to her, I said, "Well, I could see how she could — why she would say that to the mom," who's the woman who's — Emma works for now. [00:40:04]
It bothered me because I know. I hear. She comes home every day and complains about her job, every day. And I — as her friend, it is exhausting. It is like I know there are [slaps surface] shitty things about my job, too, but either change it or kind of like zip it. [Sniffles] But that's — so that's, I guess, what bothered me about it. Like, I — I — I know I'm just going to have to keep hearing about it. And I — it just bothered [slaps surface] me that, I guess — I guess this, like, [sniffles] just the whole — I don't know. [Slaps surface] It bothered me that it seems like she is just kind of being, [pause for five seconds] I guess, a little bit lazy about it? Like, she's doing something that doesn't make her happy but claiming that — she just wants to take this [slaps surface] year off to do something that makes her happy. And so I just — I guess I just don't really understand it. [00:41:11]
[Sniffles] [Pauses for five seconds] So that bothered me, but I — but, again, like it is [slaps surface] just not my life choice. And I guess if her constantly complaining about her job grates on me, then just — I don't know. I don't know what [chuckles] — like, I'm not going to tell her, "Don't complain about your job." I'm not rude. Um, [sighs] I don't know. I just don't understand it, I guess. But, again, before, I would have told her, like — I would have been kind of blunt and rude, a little bit rude, like, saying — like, as soon as — instead of congratulating her — because my initial — when she said it, I was like, in my head, my face was like, "Are you crazy? Like, you run through these lists of, like —" — I don't know.[00:42:12]
I guess we all do it. I guess I do it. I guess I'm, like, complaining [chuckles] about my family, and here I am, like, packing up to go move in with them for three months? [Sniffles] [Fidgets] But [slaps surface]...
THERAPIST: Well, maybe that's what upsets you so much, that something she's doing, like making decisions when she said she — that she says she doesn't want to make, and also making decisions — maybe poor decisions...
CLIENT: [Slaps surface] Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Serious (ph) decisions that conflict with something she wants, that it reflects — that you see yourself in that... [00:43:04]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And you're frustrated with yourself.
CLIENT: [Sniffles] Yeah, definitely. I think that's a big problem with our friendship, in general. We have — we're very similar in those ways. We're both really insecure. We both like — we both make, kind of, decisions motivated by similar things, and, yeah, I think that [pauses] — yeah, possibly. I don't know what bothered me so much about it, [shifts in seat] but I just felt like it was fake. I felt like it was all, like, "That's not true!" Like, I just didn't — it didn't make any sense to me. [Pauses] I don't know. [Inhales] And then I tried to, like — I tried to put myself into her shoes when the mom, the woman that she works for, came home and said, "So —" — it is like a — I don't know — there are just like so many things [chuckles] wrong with it. [00:44:09]
Slaps surface] So when she came home and offered her full-time work and said — she was like, "We just had, like, for the first time, a really honest conversation about, like, what I need and what —" — this and that. The other part of it is that she got her master's degree, and she's not using it, and that's something that I'm really jealous of, I think.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And so it was like, "You not only have a college degree. You just finished your <i>master's</i>, and you're just going to be a <i>nanny</i> like I am?" Like, I <i>hated</i> that I couldn't do anything more. Like, I didn't hate my job, but I hated that that was my only option, that it felt like my only option. Granted, there were other options, but [pauses] I felt like I was in a position where this was the only job I had to make the amount of money that I needed to make — to support Chris and I, like, this was it. [00:45:05] [Clucks]
And she has so many more choices, and she — and, like, I get like — I just — I guess it makes me jealous and really, like [pauses] I just don't get it. Like, you have something that — I don't know — [slaps surface]. And so then when she says, "I'm just doing something that is going to make me happy," [sniffles] but then comes home — and so I can support, I can totally get behind that. Like, I can get behind someone saying — doing something that's going to make them happy. I could absolutely get behind that.
THERAPIST: But you feel like it is not honest.
CLIENT: It is not honest, because someone who's doing something that makes them happy doesn't come home and complain for 30 minutes every day. [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:46:00]
CLIENT: And I've got a — confused.
THERAPIST: Mm. You're [making good self] (ph) each day. I do want to say, if there is any — first of all...
CLIENT: [Blows on something]
THERAPIST: ...Whoever — whoever you see in New Hampshire, I'm more than happy to talk to.
CLIENT: Oh, OK.
THERAPIST: The other thing is, if it takes a little bit of time before you find someone...
CLIENT: Yes? [Shifts in seat]
THERAPIST: ...I think that, you know, one option would be for us to do phone sessions.
CLIENT: Oh, OK.
THERAPIST: So I'm completely — you know, if that's something you really need, I just want to offer that as an option.
CLIENT: Thank you. That actually...
THERAPIST: OK?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's very comforting.
THERAPIST: OK?
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: So I'll see you on Monday.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: OK, take care.
CLIENT: All right, thanks so much.
