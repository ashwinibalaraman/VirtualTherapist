"YES, Captain Johnson, you'll poll well. I'm sure
you'll poll well. Everybody to whom I've talked
says that you'll poll well."


Within two days of the announcement of the vacancy
Mrs. Griffin, by now well-steeped in the intricacies
of Independent politics, had visited Chippenham in
order to spy out the Promised Land. This was her
report.


The time is now overdue for me to pay a tribute to
Mrs. Griffin who by this time had fostered me for over
two years. Mrs. Griffin who believes to this day that I
have never really appreciated her. And indeed this would
be so, were I not to add some supplement to the rather
meagre mention of her which I have already made. For
this chapter, though it is the culmination of this part of
my book, does not really belong to me—still less does it
belong to the Liberal Action Group, or to Common
Wealth, or to those political correspondents who, writing
their columns in London, were all so wildly wrong about
the Chippenham election. It belongs to Mrs. Griffin who
was right in assuring me that I would "poll well" when
everybody else was wrong; and who at the same time
weighed in with one hundred per cent, help when all
but a few others held back.


To those of us who have lived in that city as emigrants
from more stimulating climes, the inhabitants of Bristol
have not as a rule seemed a quickly-reacting body of

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When it appeared—as soon it did—that others doubted
about my chances for the Chippenham by-election, it was
Mrs. Griffin who spurred me on.


"Never mind about those London people, Captain
Johnson," said Mrs. Griffin, "What do they know about
Chippenham? You'll soon prove them wrong."


It was in the encouraging knowledge of having Mrs.
Griffin's dynamism at my service that, oblivious to all
obstacles, I embarked on this adventure and applied for
Army leave to fight the Chippenham by-election.


Long before my Army release was through, however, I
had journeyed the twenty odd miles from Bristol to
prospect for myself. For, at least, if Chippenham had
no other convenience, and it indeed proved not to
have many, it had that of being handy to our home
base.


I have not known Chippenham in days of peace and
plenty and doubtless this small Wiltshire market town,
which has developed over recent times into a minor centre
of industry, has under normal conditions its more mellow
features. But in the midst of totalitarian warfare, there

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As far as an Independent aspirant to Parliament was
concerned, Chippenham was at first sight a <i>carte blanche</i>—
it was a <i>misère</i> hand—it was a complete "Yarborough"
without a face card of any kind. There were—despite
Mrs. Griffin's happy reports of secret sympathy—no open
supporters in sight. There was nowhere to hold a meeting
except the open Market Square; for all the halls were
occupied. There were no unoccupied premises in the
whole town available for Committee Rooms. Worse still,
there was nowhere to sleep at night. The inhabitants of
Chippenham were living under a Reign of Terror; their
fear was inspired by the local Billetting Officer; the town
was a restricted residential area under a Regulation of the
Ministry of Health and it was unwise to let it be known
that you had a spare room in your house. Even "The
Angel" had no room when I applied for accommodation.
There was no room at the inn—or anywhere else—in
Chippenham for such a stray venturer as an Independent
candidate.


My campaign had perforce to be started from 2 South
Dene, Bristol, from where Mrs. Griffin and I made daily
treks to and fro until such time as the kind-hearted
Brothers Bulson took pity on our distress and allowed us
to rent their vacant shop in Church Street, Calne, a mere
six miles away from the centre of our activities; where I
not only opened my Committee Rooms but also pitched
my camp bed and personal lodgment. This was to be the

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But even this was to be in the future as, each evening
in these early days of our venture, I sat down with Mrs.
Griffin and we considered our plan of attack over the
table in the back room at 2 South Dene. In fact, it seemed
difficult to visualise a situation that could present more
liabilities and fewer assets with which to meet these
liabilities.


The first hurdle to surmount was that of so much as
gaining a foothold in the constituency which I aspired to
represent. I had plunged in, relying on the strength of the
Liberal vote in the Chippenham Division and evidences
were available both of the strength of this vote and of its
general goodwill towards me. But, to start with anyway,
even the Liberals were coy and shy, deterred partly by
native Wiltshire suspicion of any outsider, partly by the
fact that in order to maintain my position as an Independent
I had taken the logical step of resigning from the
Liberal Party.


"Never mind about the Liberals," encouraged Mrs.
Griffin when I expressed anxiety at this. "You'll poll well,
Captain Johnson. Mark my word, you will."


The only thing to do was to put as brazen a face as
possible on these circumstances. Though, as I have made
amply clear, I knew not a single soul within its precincts,
I had already announced to the Press that I had been
<i>invited</i> to contest the Chippenham Division. I thought
that it sounded better that way. But, no sooner was the
announcement out, than it was being demanded up and
down Chippenham as to who had extended this invitation
to an unknown person.


Our immediate task, therefore, was to find someone who
would acknowledge this pre-dated invitation to contest.
For, of course, unless we could obtain ten signatures to a
nomination paper, we were non-starters in this election.

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As was right and proper, Mrs. Griffin's first approach
was made to the much respected local leaders of the
Liberal and Labour Parties. Surely they would not wish
to see their cause abandoned to the Conservatives
unopposed?


Councillor A. E. Hill, Chairman of the Liberal Association,
though later to become my most firm friend and
supporter, would, however, have none of me until such
time as he knew who had invited me to the Division.
Councillor Hill, an exact man, pressed this point with
such persistence as to daunt even the usually dauntless
Mrs. Griffin.


Alderman Vince, Chairman of the Labour Party,
upright and rigid, would have none of me at all. No
spark of human sympathy radiated towards me from the
official heart of Alderman Vince. The Party Truce was
Labour Party policy; and Labour Party policy was gospel
for this worthy man.


However, soon Mrs. Griffin brought better tidings:


"Mr. Ryan, the secretary of the Labour Party, says
that he'd like to see you. I had a long talk with him and
he's most interested You must go and see him, Captain
Johnson."


Spurred thus with hope, I called on Mr. Ryan at his
modern semi-detached house on London Road. Mr. Ryan
was a "typical Labour man." After staidly listening to me
while, seated in his front parlour, I expounded my case,

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It exasperated me no little to feel that I had spent an
hour or more of my precious time for this:


"The worst of you Labour people, Mr. Ryan," I
exploded, "is that you are just like the Roman Catholics
in the way you allow your consciences to be controlled
by Transport House."


"I am a Roman Catholic," answered Mr. Ryan.


I had to do what I could to talk myself out of this.
But need it be said that the interview was not a success.
I had made my worst gaff ever in politics.


"Never mind about the Labour people," consoled Mrs.
Griffin, "Mark my words, you'll poll well, Captain
Johnson. I was talking to Mrs. Succony this afternoon
and she says that all her customers are on your side and
are going to vote for you."


The late Mrs. Succony, worthy proprietress of the
Snack Bar in the Causeway was, indeed, Mrs. Griffin's
first convert to our cause:


"Every one of these lorry drivers who come in for their
cups of tea have votes," reminded Mrs. Griffin, "Then
she has a son in the Forces and knows plenty of other
women who are mothers of serving soldiers. She says
that they are solid for you."


I thought for a minute and an idea germinated in my
brain.


"Will Mrs. Succony invite me to contest Chippenham?'


"I'll ask her to-morrow when I look in," said Mrs.
Griffin, "I have no doubt whatever that she will."


The following evening Mrs. Griffin brought back an
affirmative answer. I had been invited to contest the
Chippenham Division by Mrs. Succony, snack bar owner
and Mother of a Serving Soldier.


We had cleared our first hurdle.

[p. <i>233</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While local affairs had priority it was necessary also in
a by-election of national importance to look for support
on a wider scale.


In this I was less happy, if anything, than in my local
efforts. I have described in my previous chapter the
deterioration which my personal position had undergone.
Now my opportunity had arrived at last; but it had been
too long in coming. As leader of a Liberal revolt, I had
pursued my revolt too far without having anything to
show for it. In the space of a few months I had slipped
badly—I did not myself realise how badly I had slipped.
With the falling away of my support, I had become a voice
crying in the wilderness—a tiresome voice capable only
of writing long, verbose letters to people who were much
too busy to read them. I became a mere "opportunist";
a permanent nuisance and nothing else.


I failed to realise this when, full of hope and expectancy,
I attended my third war-time Liberal Assembly this same
July with intent to sponsor an amendment condemning
the sending of "Coupon" support to Party Truce candidates
by Party leaders—an amendment that had been put
down before the vacancy that had created the Chippenham
by-election had happened, but which now had particular
cogency to my own fortunes. Our amendment (it
was seconded by Ivor Davies) this time obtained a hearing,
if a somewhat inequitable one: in fact, we had this
particular Assembly in an uproar. But we were none the
better for that. Our antics failed to make the news that
we hoped they would make; and, since we failed in this,
when the whole weight of official Party prestige was
thrown against my obtaining any support for my
Chippenham project, it carried all before it.

[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00236&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Those who had immediate responsibility for this campaign
against me were not over-scrupulous and my
political reputation nose-dived under the weight of fresh
calumny that was poured upon it. I have told how in
previous years I had assisted the efforts of the so-called
"progressive" forces. I had, in my own estimation anyway,
stored up treasures of gratitude and obligation which
I felt would be repaid to me when I needed help in my
turn. But I could not have been more mistaken. The
Popular Fronters, the 1941 Committee-ers, the Radical
Action-eers, the Common Wealth-ers, divided as they
might be on many things, appeared unanimous on two
points—on the poor view that they took of Chippenham,
and on the equally poor view that they took of me. In the
face of the defeats which they had recently suffered as a
result of divided counsels the contention that the Chippenham
Division, with a Liberal vote of 9,000 at the previous
election, could be fought by a Liberal as a single candidate,
failed completely to register.


This was obvious when, still in search of support, I
called at the Common Wealth London office to see the
General Secretary, R. G. W. Mackay. Maybe it was our
natural political antipathy, or maybe it was the ancient
feud of the Clan Chattan, of which my McIntosh forebears
are a sept, and the Clan Kay that rose within
us, but R. G. W. Mackay and I were allergic to
each other at sight. Our interview turned into a bitter
quarrel within the first few minutes; and that was the end
of prospects of Common Wealth support for me.


My approaches to others, to whom I had hopefully
written, were no more happy. Whether it be Dr. A. D.
Lindsay, Master of Balliol (who was still in the same
doubtful frame of mind as when he had talked with me
previously) or Mr. Vernon Bartlett (who declared that only
in very exceptional circumstances would he back a
candidate who was not backed by Common Wealth). Or

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The only variation, in fact, from this tale of refusal
was the letter which I received from Clem Davies.
With our arrangement of some months previous in
mind I had felt it worth while sinking my pride to write
to Clem Davies; and it was with some of the old elation
that I read:
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Donald,
</p>
<p>
I hope to see Horabin this morning. Let us know more
about this. I am sure that you can rely on us.
</p>
<p align="right">
yours sincerely,
Clem.
</p>
</blockquote>


Dear Donald,


I hope to see Horabin this morning. Let us know more
about this. I am sure that you can rely on us.


yours sincerely,
Clem.


It is all the more unfortunate that I have heard no
further word from Clem Davies from that day to this.

In the meantime the choice of those prominent citizens
of North West Wiltshire who formed the Chippenham
Divisional Conservative Association had fallen upon
David McAdam Eccles, whose father, W. McAdam
Eccles, had been my surgical chief at Bart's. David
Eccles was at that time a neophyte to politics and it
was his first election campaign—one which, as far as I
understand, he had been promised by all his political
mentors would be a walk-over.


So the fight was on. With David Eccles representing
established society and political convention. With myself
representing that inspiration within me which coincided
in turn with the vague, inchoate longing of numbers
of ordinary people for a new political dispensation that

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Meanwhile, however, the corporate conscience of the
Chippenham Divisional Liberal Association was fettered
by the Party Truce, whose bonds were only sufficiently
elastic to allow it to dispose of a set of 38,000 already-addressed
election envelopes to us for the "fair price"
of £30. These envelopes had been addressed in expectation
of the election which had not taken place in 1939 and in
the intervening years they had been a wasting asset for
the Chippenham Liberal Association. This was a golden
opportunity to dispose of them while the electoral register
on which they were addressed was still only a year out
of date—for our election in 1943 was still being fought
on the 1940 register. On our side we were appropriately
grateful for what seemed a windfall. We thought we had a
bargain. But did we? Mrs. Griffin who had the job of
sorting and re-numbering these 38,000 envelopes has
been known to express doubts about this. But Mrs.
Griffin, being a Conservative, has never understood the
Liberal conscience.


So the Chippenham by-election campaign opened in
this high summer of 1943 with myself wandering "lonely
as a cloud" about the streets of Chippenham and Calne;
and with Mrs. Griffin sitting in the display window of
Messrs. Bulsons' empty shop in Church Street, Calne,
sorting the 38,000 out-of-date envelopes that had been
sold to us by the Chippenham Divisional Liberal
Association.

[p. <i>237</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. Griffin had by now been formally appointed as
my election agent. The fact that there were no other
applicants for this unenviable vacancy detracts in no
way from the tributes that are due to this remarkable
lady for the feat whereby, in almost single-handed
endeavour, she handled her envelopes and posted in the
brief time before Polling Day the 38,000 election addresses
to the electorate of Chippenham. I must hope that these
few words will be a small compensation for the greater
fame which Mrs. Griffin missed when success just failed
to crown our efforts.


For the moment, however, I must leave Mrs. Griffin
sorting and checking and filling her envelopes; and ask
you to follow my own progress through the Chippenham
Division. It was an odd feeling to walk about the streets,
to enter pubs, a conspicuous figure as I was by this time,
with everyone looking at me curiously as if I was a
strange form of creation or perhaps the bearer of a little-known
but highly-contagious disease, fortified only by
Mrs. Griffin's assurance that all these people were ready
to vote for me as their parliamentary representative—
although they certainly showed little sign of it at the
moment.


But for a diversion this peculiar stalemate between
the electors of Chippenham and myself might have
continued up to Polling Day. This diversion was provided
by the Editor of the <i>Bath and Wilts Chronicle</i> in his leading
article that appeared in the issue of 9th August, 1943,
of this enlightened publication. This read as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="center">

"LONE JOHNSON"


What the electorate of the Chippenham Division should do in
case Captain D. MacI. Johnson, the prospective Independent
candidate, forces a contest is clearly shown by the letter published
today from the Prime Minister, Mr. Ernest Brown, Mr. Attlee, and
Sir Archibald Sinclair. Representing the three great parties, they

[p. <i>238</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As their letter emphasises, it is essential that the world should
know that the electorate is backing the Government at this critical
time in our island's history. A victory for a candidate who opposes
the Government would give the impression abroad that the Government
has no longer the confidence of the people, and therefore does
not speak for a united nation. Only such an irresponsible adventurer
as Captain McI. Johnson would take the risk of interfering where he
is not only not wanted, but his presence is highly undesired. In
"An Appeal" Mr. Johnson has issued he shows that his actions are
motivated not solely by the old party spleen but by vaunting personal
ambition. "I am asking for help for myself," he writes. Who is Mr.
McI. Johnson that we or anybody else should help him? It would
appear that he is nought but a political beggar, for he outspokenly
says: "Please send offers of support or financial contributions to me
at 2, South Dene, Bristol 9, or c/o. G.P.O., Chippenham." A
political beggar who wants others to play with him the part of
glorifying him, a lone, unknown, untried and very audacious figure
who has gambolled on to the political platform as if it were a music-hall
stage and he were a rag-tattered comedian out only to catch
laughs—for he will certainly never catch votes.


But why write to Mr. Johnson at Bristol, or c/o the G.P.O.
Chippenham? The reason is that he has no other address that he has
disclosed. He has certainly not an address in Chippenham. When he
arrived he sought to gain an office from which he could work, but
searched in vain for one. So unbalanced a mind has he that he even
went to the office of the Conservative newspaper in Chippenham and
pleaded for accommodation there. Anywhere would do so long as he
got a table at which to sit and feast upon what he regards as the
Tory carcase. He has as much sense of proportion as an atheist
wanting to proclaim his "busted theories" from the pulpit of a
church.


No. Captain McI. Johnson. Learn while there is yet time. The
electors of Chippenham and district resent your intrusion. They
feel there is no need for a poll to take place. Their minds are made up
to support the Government in the enormous work they have undertaken
and which is now meeting with the success high merit deserves.
The electorate objects that a political nonentity should have the cheek

[p. <i>239</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Realise now that The Clan McI. is a party of one, showing
allegiance to none, but one, asking for financial assistance from others
for one, and pleading for a political blank cheque, yet again for one.
Some people have a nerve, and the Clan McAyes have it.


(Since writing the above we have learned that Mr. McI. Johnson
has now secured a billet in Calne, not far away from the railway
station, from which the electors will hope he will soon depart never
to return. It is not right that anyone should waste other people's
money.)


This article at least served to put me on the map. For
forty-eight hours I was turned into the figure of fun—
the rag-tattered comedian—that was intended: instead
of the silence that had hitherto greeted my entry into the
pubs, there were now sniggers and nudges. I was catching
the laughs. But at the end of that time the feeling started
to spread abroad that the Editor of the <i>Bath and Wilts
Chronicle</i> had perhaps gone a little far. Well might my
opponent have said to himself:
<blockquote>
<p>
"From my foes I can myself defend,<br />
Heaven save me from a blundering friend."
</p>
</blockquote>
No one as yet spoke to me, but sympathetic letters started
to arrive in the office. On the strength of these I billed
the town with an appeal for "Fair Play"; at the same time
announcing my intention of answering the article at an
Open Air Meeting in the Chippenham Market Square,
on the Saturday evening prior to Nomination Day—
ten days ahead.


"From my foes I can myself defend,<br />
Heaven save me from a blundering friend."


The rift in the clouds had come. The problem of
getting noticed had been solved for me. I was assured of

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The horizon had lightened in other respects too.
Honor Balfour—doubting, but faithful just the same—
had been working like a Trojan for me in her <i>Picture Post</i>
office in London. It had been no easy task to try and
round up any support for me. It was fortunate that that
sturdy figure of political independence, W. J. Brown,
recent victor of the Rugby by-election in February, 1942,
had given out the hazardous statement that he would be
willing to support anyone who took a similar step to
himself in challenging the "Party Truce" candidates.
Now Honor had been able to track down Bill Brown and
challenge him to keep his word. A visit to London and a
lunch with Bill Brown and Honor at the Czarda Restaurant
fixed matters. Bill Brown alone, amongst all those
numerous people who had expressed good intentions,
risked his political reputation in putting these into action.


We asked Bill Brown who else we could bring in.


"Come along to the House this afternoon and meet
Georgie," said Bill Brown, "He'll come along if I tell
him to."


We assembled again at 3.30 p.m. in the ever-open
bar of the House of Commons.


"Come over here, Georgie," shouted Bill Brown to
the small bespectacled man, who bore a remarkable

[p. <i>241</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Bill Brown explained the purpose of our visit.


"Pleased to meet you, love," said the small man who
looked like Arthur Askey to Honor. "Here! Here's one
of my cards."


Honor and I took the card between us. This is what we
read:
<blockquote>
<p align="center">
GEORGE L. REAKES, M.P., J.P.,<br />
<i>Director of Wallasey News</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
This was the redoubtable George Reakes whose victory
at the Wallasey by-election of April, 1942, by 5,008 votes
had probably shaken the Government more than any
other single political event.


GEORGE L. REAKES, M.P., J.P.,<br />
<i>Director of Wallasey News</i>.


"Well, Georgie, you're coming to Chippenham," said
Bill Brown.


"Chippenham. Where's Chippenham?" said Georgie
Reakes.


"In Wiltshire," said Honor.


"What's the beer like in Chippenham?" said Georgie
Reakes.


"Excellent," I said.


"Have they got plenty of beer in Chippenham?"


"Yes," I said. "Of course they have." Though I did
not know how wrong I was to be.


"All right," said Georgie Reakes. "I'll come to
Chippenham for you. I'll come down for as long as you
want me to. If Bill Brown's coming, I'll come too."


(4)


Thus we made up the Chippenham party. It was we
four—Honor Balfour, Bill Brown, George Reakes and

[p. <i>242</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hello, love," was George Reake's routine self-introduction
to the feminine sex. "My word, don't you
look nice to-day"—this to anyone whomsoever and
however elderly, boozey or unlovely she might be—
"How do you do? I'm G. L. Reakes, Member of Parliament
for Wallasey, come here from Merseyside to help
Captain Johnson."


This approach was fetching in the extreme, as, evening
after evening, George and I did the round of the Chippenham
Market Square from "The Bear" to "The Duke of
Cumberland" from "The Duke of Cumberland" to

Meanwhile the local Press, which had stepped in to
assist David Eccles in the conduct of his campaign,
continued to yell frantically that there shouldn't be an
election in Chippenham, and that this election campaign
was interrupting and hindering the War effort. Judging
by some of their statements the editors of the Wiltshire
papers could never have had the doubtful privilege of
being employed as liaison officers!


For once, however, the usually docile people of Britain
thought differently. The vast attendance at our Open
Air meetings, the approval which met Bill Brown's
sallies at the expense of the forces of nepotism and
privilege, demonstrated without further proof that the
electors saw no reason why, in a war to defend democracy,
they should not continue to practise their democratic
right of choosing their own representative. We all of us
supported Winston Churchill and the War effort, but
there was clearly support also for the view that it was the
prerogative of the electors themselves and not of any one
man, however great and commanding, to choose their
own parliamentary representative. It was to this sentiment
that we appealed when we answered a display of large
size posters CHURCHILL WANTS ECCLES with the equally

Maybe we were, as alleged, interrupting the War
effort. But such interruption as we caused had not
necessarily any deleterious effect. As the entire population
of the towns of Chippenham and Calne turned out on
these fine August evenings to see the fun, it seemed on
the contrary as if we were providing free "Holidays at
Home"—indeed throughout the War the authorities must
have paid out large sums of public money to provide
entertainment for weary war workers of a far lower
calibre than that which we were able to offer. For, during
the final days of this election, Chippenham began to take
on a considerably more lively appearance than it had done
hitherto—or possibly has done ever since.


As the sun shone out of an almost cloudless sky, there
was only one shadow that overhung us during these final
days. The progress we made in Chippenham and Calne
was undeniable, but the fact remained that some three-fifths
of the electorate lived in the country districts of
the division. Thither George Reakes and I sallied forth
to practice that same technique of introduction that had
been standing us in such good stead in the towns. The
ball was at our feet, we felt, as we drove out each evening
into the wide country spaces. But alas for human presumption,
in this thirstiest August on record, as George
and I went from village to village, instead of the open
bar parlours where we could anticipate a welcome by
our fellow men, we met nothing but closed doors. And
on these doors was written that sad sign <b>"NO BEER."</b>
And with the absence of beer, it was as if the human race
had vanished too, leaving a depopulated countryside.

Even so, as the excitement worked to a crescendo, it
seemed as if, despite our difficulties, the impossible had
already happened. Not only could we win—but even
more than that, with all these encouraging people that
now surrounded us as we went from street to street,
we could not fail to win.


Bill Brown and I walked up and down the platform
of Chippenham Station as I saw him off back to London
on the morning of Polling Day, following our immensely
enthusiastic Eve of Poll meeting, and neither of us had
much doubt.


"Remember," said Bill Brown, "George and I would
like to sponsor you when you come to the House."


"Certainly," I said.


It was all cut and dried. When, following the close of
Poll, after a final gathering at the Chippenham Liberal
Club which by now had generously opened its doors to
me, I went back to my lodging (I had even acquired a
proper bed by this time!) I was unable to sleep with
excitement. Accompanying my hours of wakefulness was
the unbelievable thought that to-morrow, when the votes
were counted, I would, according to every evidence,
find myself a Member of Parliament.

The Count of Votes at Chippenham was something of
a scratch affair—a very scratch affair. Owing doubtless
to wartime improvisation, to the fact that "there shouldn't

[p. <i>246</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was as tense and exciting as any horse race you can
imagine, with the additional qualification that it lasted
a good deal longer. It was a race that went neck and neck
with Johnson in front one minute and Eccles the next.
Meanwhile the principal supporters of the Chippenham
Conservative Association had lost their usual aplomb
and turned wan and pale at the unthinkable prospect that
was looming up of the Conservative Party losing the
Chippenham Division, while the Conservative agent sat
down on a chair and fanned himself for air, as beads
of sweat stood out on his brow. The only person indeed
who was calm, collected, an apparently detached spectator
of this sporting event, was David Eccles himself with a
brilliant career at stake in those crosses that filled one
or the other of the squares on the piles of ballot papers.


At one stage near the end I was several hundreds in
front. It indeed seemed as if I could not help but win.
But then came the turn and in the end it was David
Eccles who was exactly 195 votes ahead and I had not
after all won the Chippenham by-election—I had lost it.
No amount of recounting made any difference to this
total; and after a last desperate search through the bundles
of ballot papers Mrs. Griffin and I conceded the result.


There had, unfortunately, been a snag about those
cheering crowds who had welcomed Bill Brown and
myself in the Market Square. The snag had been that,
though these people had been inhabitants of Chippenham
and workers in Chippenham, they were to a large degree
an influx of war workers who, though in many cases their
residence was of three and four years standing, were still
in an effectively disfranchised condition owing to the fact
that the electoral register had been allowed to lapse since

[p. <i>247</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had lost the Chippenham by-election because the
Electoral Register was some four years out of date. I
had lost it for other reasons too. I had lost it because
Sir Archibald Sinclair, whose fortunes I had helped to
further in the pre-war years, had sent his "coupon"
against me, asking all Liberals to vote for the Conservative
candidate—a message which my opponents could in no
sense be blamed for reduplicating and scattering far and
wide. The "real debt of gratitude" from the Bewdley
by-election had been repaid in the base coinage of
political manoeuvre. I had lost it because my repudiation
by those in control of the Party machine had taken an
unnecessarily virulent form that had undermined my
political reputation so successfully that my associates
had allowed themselves to be over-persuaded that I had
no chance and had—quite simply—"got cold feet." I
had lost it because the Chippenham Liberals, without a
lead, refrained from supporting me in sufficient numbers
—I heard it said at a later date that I could have obtained
those extra votes to win the election in the small village
of Colerne alone from amongst the number of Liberals
who failed to register their vote from lack of guidance.


Whatever the reason, Fortune, who had seen me so
far, had turned her back on me at this last moment in the
Counting of Votes. Destiny, who had shone out in bright
raiment one minute, had faded to her customary dull grey
the next. But I felt that all this was not true. As, in the
twenty-four hours following the Declaration of Poll, I
walked in dazed fashion about the streets of Chippenham
winding up our affairs, I scarcely heard the condolences
that were poured upon me. This betrayal of Destiny
was not possible. It was as if, in this drama of my life,
I was acting the lead in a cinema film and at this juncture

But unfortunately nothing did happen. Nothing has
happened.


My efforts with the Liberal Party were ended. Except
for this book, they are the same as if they had never
been.

I did not go back to the Liberal Party. But such strong
ties as I had formed could not be broken over-night.
When the now-enthusiastic Liberals of Chippenham
overwhelmed me with their requests to fight the General
Election as their candidate, I compromised so far as to
become an Independent with Liberal support. Three
months after the Chippenham by-election came the by-election
at Darwen in November, when I was able to
repay my debt to Honor Balfour by being amongst the
still very small band of helpers who assisted her to yet
another close finish—yet another "near miss" by 70
votes after three recounts. I retained my membership of
Radical Action, but it was my turn to sit perforce on the
side lines when that body, having at this late hour come
to realise that there was something after all in this by-election
idea, came into the fray with rather tardy fury—
even to the extent of co-operating with Common Wealth
—to support Mrs. Corbett-Ashby at Bury St. Edmunds
in February, 1944. But once again by that time the
Liberal cause had missed the bus with "too little and too
late" and Mrs. Corbett-Ashby lost by a substantial
margin.

[p. <i>249</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I hoped that, by insisting on my "Independence" as a
candidate, I would perhaps avoid the fate that could with
reasonable certitude be foreseen for the Liberal Party
as such at the 1945 General Election. But "Independence"
had its snags too. "To every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction" runs our cosmic law—one that admits
perhaps of no exception until we come to the sphere of
Party politics. During the two years that intervened
between the by-election and the General Election the
Chippenham Division was a non-stop electoral battle-ground
in which, thanks to the fact that the Army
authorities had returned me to my appointment in
Bristol, I continued to compete on the mistaken
supposition that, if I could get thus far as an electioneer
in so short a time, then, if I stuck at it, I was bound to
win.


I had reckoned without the Party machines, however,
who had woken up to such a threat with an intensity of
reaction that was surprising, if disconcerting. I might
have been ignored by the national Press, underestimated
by my friends, but at least my opponents paid me the
compliment of taking me at my worth. So, as I peddled
on, giving up my spare time to address not only Liberal
gatherings up and down the countryside, but also such
influential bodies as Women for Westminster, the
Agricultural Workers' Union and so on, to labour up hill
and down dale calling on supporters in order to gain
those elusive 195 votes that had stood between myself
and Destiny, instead of gaining stature, I became as
month followed month a dwindling figure under
the weight of opposition that was brought against me.


I gained the 195 votes and a few more at the General
Election of 1945, but David Eccles gained many more
still, and a Mr. Andrew Tomlinson, notwithstanding a
<i>contretemps</i> involving a public wager and a hundredweight
of kale, weighed in with a substantial-sized Labour vote

[p. <i>250</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00252&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have often speculated how differently the result
might have turned out for the Liberal Party had we won
the Chippenham by-election in 1943, then with the
prestige thus acquired made up Honor Balfour's 70
votes at Darwen; and thus set in train that "Liberal
revival," so often talked about, but the opportunity for
which was so feebly grasped when it was within reach.
But such speculation is a pastime of an idle nature.
Events happened differently. Those who had secured my
defeat at Chippenham were, in fact, their own
executioners. Sir Archibald Sinclair, who sent his
"coupon," found that he was himself defeated by a
matter of 60 votes—an even narrower margin than those
at Chippenham and Darwen—in the Election of 1945.
Wilfrid Roberts who marshalled the weight of the
Liberal Party machine against me with such persistence,
survived one election, but then found his constituency
of North Cumberland had foundered beneath him in the
subsequent re-distribution.


The last tenuous thread of hope for the Liberal Party
snapped with the results of the 1945 election. My own
relations with the Party, having gone from climax to
anti-climax, now moved from anti-climax to absurdity.
I resigned my candidature at Chippenham and devoted
myself to the founding of the publishing firm under whose
imprint I now publish. I was not yet ready for a change
of political allegiance, however. Perhaps, I thought,
though unequal any longer to the perpetual martyrdom
of the political arena, I could help the Liberal cause in the
intellectual sphere?


It was thus that, early in 1946, I called on a certain

"We shall, of course, want forty per cent. on your
books," said Mr. Edward Martell, when I had told him
the object of my visit, "The Liberal Publication Department
are wholesalers, you know. Why are you doing
this?"


I endeavoured patiently to explain.


But I seemed to be making no very favourable
impression.


"What you fellows should do," said Mr. Edward
Martell, looking at me fiercely, "is to get out into the
constituencies."


This was where I had come in.
