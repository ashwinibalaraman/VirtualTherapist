Let's go ahead and blame my mother, the former Gertrude Breslow,
for unleashing the world's most notorious pornographer. Why not,
everybody else does. She spread her legs and made it all possible. I
was a mama's boy. My mother thought I was God and could do no
wrong. She was alive, vibrant, had a lot of drive and curiosity. Women
didn't have careers then and she held only one job I remember--
saleslady at a women's chain called the Rainbow Shop. She was also
the daughter of Russian immigrants and stuttered like me. She had
me when she was only seventeen.


I was a flabby teenager with a weight problem. When I was fifteen
my mother took me to this diet doctor, Harry Stone, MD. He prescribed
Dexedrine, those little green pills of legend, a potent amphetamine
long since discontinued. It fucked me up and I couldn't sleep.
Dr. Stone and I had no particular camaraderie--but I noticed he
gradually stopped charging us for visits. Then my mother suddenly
received a new Cadillac from him as a gift. It turned out my mother
was cheating with my diet doctor. I was utterly confused. Dr. Stone
took her on cruises and trips to Europe. My father was sold this bill of

She told me the reason she took on a lover for ten years was
because my father was so inadequate. When she was cheating, he was
too dumb to know it. I think he had Alzheimer's by his late forties.
Though my father was a putz, this established in me a real distrust
of women. Like any boy, I wanted my mother to be faithful. Years
later I accepted that even my mother was entitled to pleasure. I
turned feminist in order to process this.


The Dodgers and their swaggering locker-room cocks were like
mythical gladiators in my childhood imagination. But the real model
of manhood before me was Sam Goldstein. Meek, frightened, and
cuckolded. Years later, my mother was on the Tom Snyder show with
me. On national TV, she said, "Your dad's a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am
kind of guy." Then my mother started to disrobe and underneath
her blouse she wore a <i>Screw</i> tee shirt.


My father was humiliated. And he quietly accepted it. As far as I
could determine, my mother's adultery made my father impotent. I
never wanted to become cuckolded and impotent like my father. So
I cheated all the time on my first four wives. I don't want to go into
a semantic debate about the word <i>cheating</i>. But my attitude as a man
was crippled by the same guilt, the same middle-class, bourgeois
double standard that everyone else suffers. Blacks still bear the
results of 246 years of slavery, and we all still bear the emotional carnage
of the Puritan ethic. With the exception of some African
nations like Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Mali, and Djibouti--where
they practice forced clitoridectomies, or female genital mutilation--
America is the most sexually fucked-up country in the world. And
that's why I was born.

<b>TROPIC OF HENRY</b>


I traveled three thousand miles in 1970 to interview my top literary/cunt
eating hero, Henry Miller. I was so choked up meeting
him, I choked up. I dropped in on the Los Angeles home of Miller. I
had smuggled Olympia Press Travelers Companion copies of both
<i>Tropic of Capricorn</i> and <i>Tropic of Cancer</i> past customs and luxuriated in
his prose for years. I was awash in hero worship and talking with him
only intensified my love for him. I couldn't believe his simple white
home in the suburbs of Los Angeles had no plaque or monument testifying
as to who resided inside.


Though I was an unexpected guest, I was thrilled to find a copy of
<i>Screw</i> on his coffee table adjacent to a magazine called <i>Liberation</i>. His
first question, which cut through my awe-struck gaze was, "Why do
you use so many four-letter words when you're such a good writer?"


Miller had an entire wall in his house set up where he could write
directly or make sketches and diagrams. On the wall were snatches
from the Bible, foreign phrases or whatever was on his mind. The
handwriting was precise and artistic. He also had photographs of himself
on that wall, one with a young attractive Japanese woman who was
his wife, hiding upstairs. As he talked with a soft voice he constantly
reached out and touched my hand or shoulders.


"Twenty-five years ago I wrote a book called <i>The Air-Conditioned
Nightmare</i> and predicted exactly what's happening in America. The
falling apart of society, the riots and chaos, and, of course, the violence.
Like Elizabethan times. Today is similar. Violence and irreverence.
The mayhem of old England and the assassinations of Kennedy and
King have frightening similarities to the old period. So often past
times in history are identical to our time.


"I never travel in America, I have Europe around and within
me...many times I've wanted to go to Israel. I have a brother-in-law

Miller said his favorite writer was Issac Singer, that he and his
friends enjoyed <i>Screw</i>, and asked that I send him more copies, which
he could pass on to his twenty-one-year-old son in Canada.


--<i>Screw</i>, May 1970


<b>STATEN ISLAND FERRY</b>


The girl I miss most sexually is movie scream-queen Linnea Quigley.
She dumped me when I lost <i>Screw</i>, like everyone else. If she came
back, I wouldn't even kiss her hello, I'd dive right for her asshole. I've
been a pussy eater for half a century but acquired a more sophisticated
palate for women's rectums in my dotage.


I'm not entirely broke. I do receive social security. For the legions
of followers who miss my weekly "Screw You" editorial in <i>Screw</i> and
"Fuck You" on <i>Midnight Blue</i>, I write a weekly blog for <a href="Booble.com">Booble.com</a>.
It pays a thousand a month. But this trifling income doesn't make a
dent in my debts and liens. Whatever change I can sift out of it pays
my cell phone, cable TV and for the cheaper cigars I now must
smoke. I asked for a position as host or manager at Scores Cabaret
and at the Hustler Club. Both said no. I've applied for minimum
wage jobs--Home Depot for $ll/hour, Blockbuster for $7.50/hour.,
and all the Starbucks in Manhattan for $8/hour. None would hire me.
My wife said that Starbucks may have been put off by the brown cigar
juice that continually drools down my now-toothless jaw in a drug-induced
stupor. Doesn't Starbucks want Al Goldstein's brown cigar

Comedian Gilbert Godfried's lovely girlfriend Dara said she'd
help me become a dog walker. But I don't like dogs. I don't want to
end my life in a minimum wage job. My recurring fantasy is to take
100 milligrams of Valium, get in a warm bath, and cut my wrists. Or
better yet, hang myself like an impotent old queer, hoping to cut the
rope at the last minute and enjoy one last hard-on.
