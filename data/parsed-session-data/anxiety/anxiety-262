I often wonder why my life, which has been so full of despair, has
gradually become so peaceful. While I ascribe this change to a higher
power, the question still remains why this power has chosen to enter
my life at this particular moment. I have hit the bottom and have given
up. I know from my readings about the lives of the saints that God often
enters the hearts of women and men at such times.


But I am also convinced that the absence of work has freed my mind
from a ballast of thoughts and has given God a chance to enter it. Now
I am in this world but no longer of this world.


After years of activity and striving, I am finally able to empty my
heart, my soul, my brain, to wait and see where my ship will go if I abandon
the steering wheel, if I surrender to nothingness. Now I understand
what Lao-tse said in praise of nothingness:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Thirty spokes unite in one nave,<br />
And because of the part where nothing exists
we have the use of a carriage wheel.<br />
Clay is molded into vessels,<br />
And because of the space where nothing exists
we are able to use them as vessels.<br />
Doors and windows are cut out in the walls of
a house,<br />
And because they are empty spaces, we are able
to use them.<br />
Therefore, on the one hand we have the benefit
of existence, and on the other of non-existence</i>.

I am happy. My life has become meaningful. I feel the presence of
God as a guide. I know what I must do even though I cannot formulate
it in words. At every point of decision I am certain which way to turn.
I see my role as being a secular minister in academia. My students and
my colleagues have seen me in this way, although the latter do not always
approve of this role. I have had a <i>great</i> influence on <i>many</i> of my students.


I often ask myself why I never pray. While I feel God speaks to me
in silence, I would view it as presumptuous to speak to God. It would
appear especially presumptuous to ask God for favors. He knows my
wishes without my telling Him, and He will fulfill them if it is His will.
My heart is open and God gives. I often wonder whether Jesus was right
when He said giving is sweeter than receiving. But to question Jesus'
words seems sacrilegious and terribly impertinent.


My thoughts often wander to God, and for the first time in my life
I feel in touch with Him. I feel as if my whole life was but a prelude to
this encounter. His hand touches mine in gentle guidance, and He says,
"It is I."


A few days ago I asked the librarian to bring me some how-to books
on taking the cure from tuberculosis. Today she brought the books. Most
of them are written by physicians or ex-patients. I thumb through all of
them. The fact is stressed that a long stay in the hospital gives the patients
an opportunity to better themselves—to read good literature, to
take correspondence courses, to learn a craft. But nowhere do I see it
mentioned that the long span of recovery is an opportunity for contemplation
and that contemplation may enrich the patient's inner life. "Don't
brood" is the message most books have to give. But brooding is what
saved me from perdition.


I think the other patients lead lives similar to my own; they, too,
are removed from the pressures and obligations of a complex society.
And I feel sure that this distancing has produced insights in us which are
far superior to the insights we would have had, had we remained healthy.
I am certain that God has entered the other patients' lives as He has
entered mine.


In my fantasy I gradually, step by step, transform the hospital into
a cloister. I believe that the people who have been cured of tuberculosis are
among the chosen ones and that it is their duty to go out and preach
to the world what they have learned at the tuberculosis hospital—to

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is beautiful. My thoughts give me a feeling of exhilaration, like the
feeling people have when they are standing on a very high mountain.
Only rarely, in the evening, when the records and the television sets are
turned on high, I have the painful thought that things are not quite what
they appear to be. But the thought disappears after a few moments. It
does so in the beginning, anyway. But as time goes on, there are more
and more dissonances in my life, things which do not rhyme and which
I cannot explain.


Starting today I am permitted to mingle with other patients at
mealtime. I find myself among a group of people with backgrounds very
different from my own. Most of the patients have lived in the slums before
they were hospitalized and, in all probability, will return to the slums
after leaving the hospital. Some are illiterates, prostitutes, and ex-convicts.
I assume that poverty, malnutrition and neglect have caused their disease
in most cases.


I find it difficult to understand my fellow patients. They hold beliefs
and values different from mine, and many of them speak with unfamiliar
accents. It is especially baffling that they seek my company with such
eagerness, even though it is difficult to communicate with me because
I am so weak that listening, let alone responding, takes a considerable
effort. What possible pleasure can my fellow patients derive from spending
so much time with me? Thus, I find it difficult to understand what's
going on around me.


I still don't understand why many patients seem to be unusually
friendly towards me. Establishing human contact is a joyful experience
because I have been alone for so long. Especially the children seem to
like me.


Today is a real strange day for me. Bob, a young teacher, and I are
eating lunch together. He makes me feel depressed. Our conversation is
more concrete than usual. Bob is telling me about another patient,
Mr. McHugh, who worries whether he will ever be able to make a living,
since he gets out of breath when delivering newspapers at the sanatorium.
It is not compassion for Mr. McHugh which depresses me, it is something

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Moreover, today Bob does not respond to my comment on a book
by Camus. It is rather surprising since, in the past, he has always participated
in our philosophical discussions with great eagerness. But today
he talks about knitting, and he dwells at length on the fact that hand-knitted
sweaters are more durable than machine-knitted ones. I start to
feel that I don't understand what is going on around me.


As Christmas draws closer, there are more and more riddles which
I cannot solve. The patients at Valley View, as in every hospital of this
kind, keep busy at what is called occupational therapy. They knit, embroider,
weave, make leather goods, and work with wood. But not I.
I think, and I write my diary. Today I notice again that more and more
patients approach me and speak to me. But what they talk about is always
their occupational therapy. And they describe in great detail the objects
they are making. Yet they know my thoughts are far away from such
matters.


Here is a riddle. Why do they do this? Perhaps they like me and reveal
to me what fills their minds rather than mine. Or perhaps their tales are
hints that I, too, should be busy making things. For days and days I
wonder and I listen to wool, cotton, wood, and leather.


"You have a pretty purse," says one patient.


"It is a present."


"Oh, a leather present!"


What does he mean? Then he starts to tell me what beautiful things
he has made out of leather.


When one of them talks to me too long, another one pushes him
away and makes his work seem even more beautiful. Oh, I suddenly
understand! The people who are telling me about the goods they make
are trying to sell them to me. Christmas is drawing close and everyone
needs money.


Now something strange happens to me. Within a fraction of a second,
my picture of Valley View and what I have experienced here reverses
itself completely, like a picture seen through a kaleidoscope. This is not
a cloister, not a place where people find God through leisure and contemplation.
Instead it is a rat race where everyone works as hard as he
can trying to make a buck, and every little merchant keeps a jealous eye

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I cannot eat and I cannot sleep. I cannot speak and I cannot listen.
I think of all that has happened at the sanatorium, but now I see it in
a new light. And minute by minute I have new insights. In this hospital
it is forbidden to solicit customers for one's wares; thus, the patients have
to drop hints regarding their salable goods. And Bob, since he speaks more
to me than anyone else, must have been briefed by the others to describe
their work to me in the most glowing terms.


Then there is Irma, another patient. Her husband was shot by his
brother. It happened a few months ago. A patient whose name I don't
know told me Irma had hallucinations. She saw her dead husband sitting
by her bed. I wanted to go and comfort her. I found her standing in the
hall in front of her room.


"Rats! They are after me! Rats!" she yelled and pointed.


But where she pointed to I saw no rats.


I walked into her room, asked her to get into bed, and then sat down
and held her hand. She is contagious, but it did not matter to me at that
time.


But now a suspicion arises within me. Did she really see her dead
husband? Did she see rats? Did she have hallucinations? She is poor
because she has not been able to earn any money since the onset of her
consumption. She knows that I am a psychologist. Perhaps she is seeking
my friendship by faking hallucinations so I will give her money.
Because, you see, I am the only person in the hospital who has money.
I have developed a warm tenderness toward this woman. When she is
upset, she permits no one to come to her room but me. But now it seems
as if the wool has been pulled over my eyes.


Today another thing has happened which fits in with my interpretation.
Irma says: "When I speak to you I feel like a person." Suddenly
the ice in my veins melts, and I feel the warm blood streaming through
my body. But later I speak to a friend of mine, a social worker, who has
come to visit. She says, "People from the lower classes frequently say
things like ‘You make me feel like a person’ to professional workers when
they can use them to their advantage. They have learned to use and abuse
the language which will impress the professionals." Tears roll over my

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Gradually I remember one incident after another which could be
viewed as a commercial promotion rather than as a genuine act of friendship.
It seems I am perceived as a prospective buyer or donor of money
rather than as a person. Now I can interpret every incident, including
the smallest detail, according to my new insight.


Take, for example, Tobey. Why did he hold up his stuffed animals
to me when he saw me standing on the balcony? I thought it was to
proudly show me his possessions or to induce me to love the little animals,
giving them the affection which was really meant for him. But now I think
he may have approached me for different reasons. Some time ago I bought
two bunnies from his mother; she had made the little animals herself from
bits of cotton and wool, and after that she must have taught Tobey to
show me other animals so I would buy them. In my darkest moments,
I believe that the little fellow's mother taught him to approach me because
she knew that I could be of financial help, and that all the love he
showed me was not sincere but just pretended. But now I remember how
his face lit up each time I opened my door to see him. The eagerness of
his little face was genuine.


Next I remember the incident of hair washing. A beautician from the
neighborhood comes to see me every week to wash and set my hair. I
pay her four dollars for her work. I am the only one in the hospital who
engages in such luxury. Recently I observed something peculiar. Every
time I went to the bathroom, there were several other women who
followed me. It was quite clear that they came to the bathroom at that
special moment so I could see them. They all had pink curlers in their
hair. No doubt they wanted to show me that they could set their own
hair, and thus they could set mine and make some money.


Several days later something even more striking happened. While
I was eating breakfast in my room in the early morning, I heard a loud
noise. I opened the door to the hall, and it was immediately apparent
what had caused the noise. A nurse's aide had dropped a tray of dishes
and silver right in front of my door. It could not have been an accident;
she had done it in order to get my attention. Then I looked out and saw
Mary Anne, my thirteen-year-old neighbor, setting the hair of Anabel, her

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now that I understand that people have been trying to offer me their
services, many other things fall into place. For example, Sarah, the fifty-year-old
factory worker, often mentioned during meals that she had spent
the morning washing. She would elaborate in great detail how she had
washed and ironed one blouse and then another one, one slip and then
another. I now know this was a hint, but at first I was in doubt about
what she was trying to convey. Perhaps, I thought, she wanted to induce
me to do my washing, too. I noticed with some embarrassment the
spots on my blouse and skirt. But now I understand her hints. It was she
who wanted to do my washing in order to make some extra money.
Maybe she even wanted to become my maid after we both got well. At
the same time, I understand why Mr. Bailey told me how well he could
repair plumbing, even though he has never been trained to be a plumber.


Sometime after my discovery, one of Sarah's moving talks on Christian
virtue led to her offering me a subscription to the <i>Watchtower</i>. I
found her insincerity harder and harder to take. One day I wrote to my
friend Rebecca that Sarah was of great spiritual beauty, and the next day
I no longer felt it was true.


Before I became sick, I often read that the process of selling and buying,
and of competing in doing so—the process of being friendly to
people because they could become potential customers—makes genuine
relationships impossible. I had never truly experienced that this was correct.
But now I know it is true! What happens in the large and complex
world is reflected on a small scale in our hospital. Now it is simple enough
to be truly understood.


Dr. Clark told me that I can leave the hospital for a few hours every
week. Last night, a freezing winter night, I returned from my short leave
dressed in a warm fur coat. When we arrived at the front door of the
hospital in the Cadillac my husband was driving, there were four figures
there: two men and two women, looking like shadows in the dusk. Their

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now all my suspicions are confirmed. After the evening meal, people
suddenly behave strangely toward me. Usually after dinner I ride upstairs
by elevator all by myself, because the other patients prefer to take the
stairs. Today, however, everything is different. Bob opens the door to
the elevator for me; this time it is crowded with patients. They all are
from another ward, but they ask me to come to their ward and visit. I
find myself talked to, shoved and pushed, taken by the arm, and finally,
almost against my will, sitting alone with Sarah, an elderly patient, in
her room. She tells me how poor Irma is. (Irma is the woman who said
that I made her feel like a person.) Irma's brother and sister and niece
were all stricken by tuberculosis at the same time, and her husband was
shot by his brother. Then she tells me about herself, that she is alone and
an old woman. She does not need too much. She asks me if I could lend
her ten dollars. She could return the money later, when she receives her
welfare check.


I lend and give and buy. But it is hard to decide how much sharing
is reasonable. For how can one person rectify the abysmal injustice of
our social system? Now I suspect even more than before that Irma's
hallucinations were a fake. And so was perhaps much of what has
happened between me and other patients. I have developed a genuine
affection for some, but they see me only as a source of money. I have
to give up my image of a cloister where everyone lives in his cell quietly
contemplating God. But now it no longer matters, since I believe I am
about to make another exciting discovery.


It started with my medication. I have been taking the same kind and
the same dose for many weeks. But yesterday, when the medication nurse
came in bringing the usual brown powder and pink capsule, something
had been added: a large, white pill. I asked what it was, but I did not
get an answer. The same pill was added to my medication at noon and
after supper. Otherwise, the day was uneventful and so was the following
night.

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But when I woke up this morning, everything had changed. First
came the noise. On past mornings it had been quiet in my room, and all
I could hear was the hum of the air-conditioner. But now there is screaming
and shouting. I open the door to see who is making the noise. I find
it is almost everybody. The nurses' aides scream their breakfast orders
to the kitchen maid, and the kitchen maid screams back. Only yesterday
the patients remained quietly in their rooms, but this morning they are
all standing at the door and shouting at each other excitedly. They even
look different. My young neighbor Mary Anne, for example, used to wear
well-pressed, light cotton dresses and to keep her hair neat by braiding
it left and right. I had often wondered about her dresses—how she kept
them so clean and well ironed—and why a girl her age would not wear
more informal clothes which would not require so much care. Today,
for the first time, she wears blue jeans and a dirty, white T-shirt. Her hair
looks uncombed—like the hair of a savage. And the other patients, too,
look ungroomed, dirty, and somewhat wild.


The strangest thing of all is that even the trains which pass on the
nearby railroad track seem louder. Oh now I understand. My mind catches
on and I start to think sharply. It cannot be that the trains are louder today
than they have been for weeks before. The change must be in me.
Within a split second I venture an explanation: the white pills. I started
to take them twenty-four hours ago, three yesterday and one this morning.


The thought brings vague associations to my mind and veiled hints
which were made here and there. One patient said, "I was ready to go
home six months ago, but they just keep us here indefinitely. All we are
is guinea pigs." Guinea pigs? What did she mean?


Another time, Mrs. Godsey (Tobey's mother) said to me, "Why are
you still here? I would take this up with Dr. Clark if I were you." It
sounded as if she thought I was being retained at the hospital without
justification. It even sounded as if she knew the reason. And again I feel
that there is something which everbody knows except myself.


I begin to suspect that the tuberculosis hospital is not what it appears
to be. Instead it is a place where they conduct experiments on the effect
of drugs on people's thinking and behavior. Not of tuberculosis drugs,
but of drugs like opium and LSD.


On the morning that I found everybody wild and loud and different,
it must have been the day when everybody's medication was changed.

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My discovery makes me exhilarated and happy. At last I understand
what is going on around me. But since I am not sure my discovery is
correct, I shall keep it to myself, and I shall be very cautious when I speak
to other people. I drop a few hints, but never state clearly what I think.


Ever since Aldous Huxley published <i>The Doors of Perception</i>, which
illustrates the effect of psychedelic drugs, it has been my ardent wish to
take part in an experiment on drug effects. Now my wish has been fulfilled:
I shall look within me with great curiosity and expectation and
note every thought and feeling.


At the same time, I feel manipulated by Dr. Clark, who is using me
for his purpose without asking permission. I remember a science-fiction
story in which a group of scientists keeps creatures from another planet
captive in order to observe and study them. The creatures finally escape
and return to their own planet. Shall I escape?


Occasionally I feel strong hatred against Dr. Clark for what he is doing
to me. I assume he feels justified in doing whatever he wants with
me because he saved my life. Many other patients feel this same hatred,
and now I know it is the drug experiment which has given rise to it. "If
I could get my hands on his throat ...," one patient said to me some
time ago. And Bob made some furtive hint about a lawsuit for medical
malpractice. Are we all prisoners?


My husband, too, has controlled me, and at times I hate him for it.
For I suspect he signed an official permission that I could be used in the
experiment. He has the legal right to do so—he has held the power of
attorney over me since I got tuberculosis.


I was proud of all the thoughts which I had written down in my daily
journal. It hurt my pride when I found out they had been induced through
drugs. But if everyone reacts differently to the same drug, it is still I who
thinks and not the drug. There is no one on the ward who sits and thinks
and writes as I do.


But then there is God, the God whose guidance I feel so gently. Could
it be a chemical God? Could my feelings of nearness and of faith be
caused by drugs? I do not know. The thought that my own religious
feelings—so recently developed, so tender and delicate, so easy to destroy,
and so ardently needed—that these religious feelings could be induced
by drugs seems shattering. I quickly invoke a dear memory, the memory

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The people on the ward are becoming wilder and wilder. I am afraid
they will come into my room and tear up my journal. Perhaps this is a
reason to escape. No. If I can find a safe place for my manuscript, I will
stay; I shall send it to my husband, and I shall stay.


From looking at my fellow patients, there is no doubt that some of
them are taking drugs different from the ones I am taking. But others
are taking the same. It becomes clear to me that the people to whom I
feel close, with whom I can converse with ease, who share my sense of
humor and who understand me even if my words are full of hints and
slight allusions, that these people are taking the same drug as I. Take Bob,
for example. When something is said between us, I often do not know
if it is he or I who says it. We are congenial. I think he must be taking
the same drug as I am. For instance, Bob asked me at dinner time, "Is
there a Dr. Miller?" (Dr. Miller is the medical director of the hospital and
also my physician. I understood what he meant. No one except me ever
sees him, but his signature is under all the "Do this" or "Don't do this"
communications brought to us by the aides. Bob wondered, with tongue
in cheek, if Dr. Miller is an invented authority figure (like God, in Bob's
view). I represented idealism, which Bob denied in himself; and he
represented cynicism, which I denied in myself.


The experiment must have a wider scope than just our hospital,
because there are people outside with whom I have some kind of
understanding. One is my husband. He, too, is taking the same drug as I.


But Rebecca, my young friend and student who visits me every week,
is taking different drugs or none at all. For I can never quite get the point
of what she says to me.


Irma is on my drug, no doubt.


Then there is Shirley. She called me long-distance last night. She
spoke fast and with great excitement about an invention she had made

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But Conrad—a tall, slender lunger with whom I can joke like
nobody's business—is on my drug. I feel sure about that.


My notion that it was leisure and contemplation which made many
patients so sensitive and full of humor collapses right on my lap, and I
feel sad. The chemical origin of behavior does not appeal to me.


While staying at the tuberculosis hospital, I have written a few articles
and have published them in several journals. Maybe they, too, have
been conceived under the influence of drugs. Some of my colleagues have
written me complimentary letters about my publications. They may have
been under the influence of the same drug as I was taking. Maybe the
drug experiment is extremely wide in scope. It is very likely that most
of my readers know about it and consider my articles not as an objective
contribution, but as a drug-induced sample of behavior. Am I like a fly
caught in a glass and watched from the outside?


Now something comes to my mind which makes my heart skip a beat:
Tobey, my little four-year-old friend. He was so bright and eager when
we were together, but he changed into such a listless little fellow after
he was transferred to the children's ward. Had he been doped? Was our
love for each other chemical too?


Today I am trying to analyze the exact relation between and among
people who were taking the same drug, the one I was taking at that time.
It seems as if such people understood each other well when talking and
joking but could not agree on the realities of living. At least this was the
case with my husband and me. For example, Zuzu wanted to live in an
upper-class house and neighborhood and associate exclusively with conventional,
wealthy Jews; whereas I did not want such a lifestyle.


Then I search further, but something unexpected happens: the next
morning when the nurse brings my medication, the white pill is missing.
Instead, there is a red one.


I give it time, twenty-four hours, to ooze into my bloodstream. I
receive it three times a day. Today, for the first time in many months,

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I open the door. The wild excitement of my fellow patients has
vanished. They, too, must have had a change in medication. I walk
through the corridor, peeking into every room to see what they are doing.
Mary Anne is sewing. Anabel is watching television. Rose Marie is reading.
Faith is embroidering. When I pass by, she shows me the pillow slip she
is working on and asks, "Do you like it?" I answer with a vague
yes and go on to Deborah's room. She is knitting.


In the afternoon I make another round. Again Mary Anne is sewing,
Anabel is watching television, Rose Marie is reading, Faith is embroidering.
And again she shows me her pillowcase and asks, "Do you like it?"


And Deborah is knitting.


During the week which follows, I make the rounds every morning
and afternoon and always find the patients doing exactly what they did
before. My mind becomes blurred, and I feel as if time stands still. My
many rounds merge into one round in their uncanny sameness. But now
I understand: it is the new medication which forces the patients to remain
with their tasks once they have started them, like the damned
creatures of Hades. And last of all, I notice that I, too, am doing the same
