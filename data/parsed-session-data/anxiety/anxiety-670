MANY of the patients had taken interest in the illness
of Queen Victoria. The day when we learned the
sad news of her death the Irish gentlewoman patient
said: “On earth the Queen had been first;
now in heaven she would be second to the angels.” The
patients also rejoiced in the approaching coronation of King
Edward. The dear old gentlewoman patient from Ireland
related in an old fashioned style, that “the King had married
Alexandra, who is the fair and good daughter of the King
of Denmark, who ruled over land by the sea.” She mentioned
that the Irish had always loved her from the hour she had
been pledged to wed their sportive Prince. The patients are
so like children that I ventured to compose a story for them,
taking of course the national event of the coronation of the
new King and Queen for the foundation of the story. The
beginning of which was the old, old rhyme:


“Pussy cat, pussy cat,<br />
Where have you been?<br />
I have been to London to see the Queen.<br />
Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you there?<br />
I frightened a wee mouse under the chair.”


The story about the cat and the mouse who attended the
coronation ceremony of that noted event gave decided delight.
When the part of the story was reached where the
mouse had nestled in the robes of the Queen, and thus made
an escape from the vigilant eye of the cat, not a few of the
patients clapped their hands. Later when the fate of the cat
was known, that he was allowed to make his home with the
royal couple because he had frightened away the mouse, they
complimented the King upon his goodness to the cat. They
congratulated the cat that he could now protect the Queen

I was strictly forbidden by Madam Pike to speak with a
certain patient who had lived near my own home, and who
had known my people. I managed, however, to do so. As
she gave correct items of news of outsiders, and past events,
I urged her to tell me her opinion of the Institution. To my
astonishment she accused Madam Pike of having drugged her
to prevent her attending her mother's funeral. She continued:
“Madam knew I would tell of her cruelty.” “How do
you know?” I inquired, “that she gave you a drug?” “From
the effect I suffered,” she answered. “Did you tell of this
suspicion, and also speak of her probable motive?” I inquired.
She answered: “Yes.” In further conversation she spoke
favorably of the other Madams. I heard all she said without
comment. Returning to the Hall I had fears of breaking
down and making an exhibition of tears. As I did not care
to be caught crying, I went to the piano to find relief in music.
I played a few waltzes, but their brightness was not in harmony
with my feelings. My next selection being R. Schmann's
“Thou Sunny Beam,” as I called my well-minded friend by
this title, and the words of the song, “Too narrow in my room,
my home, and in the bowery grove I roam,” so fitted in with

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The birthday of the first President of our country was
noted with merrymaking. A selected few of the patients on
the previous day visited a near city. In consequence of their
purchases there were a few toy hatchets, and some cherries
tied together, bought as gifts, which were distributed in honor
of the day. In the afternoon some of the patients, assisted
by some small boys from the neighborhood, gave pleasure
through an entertainment. The tableaux were interesting.
General Washington was represented in the act of crossing
the Delaware. This tableau wafted my thoughts to patriotic
memories; but a whistle from the modern steam engine diverted
my thoughts from those times, and brought them back
to the wonderful progress made by the world since that famous
date. This episode also recalled to my thoughts my own sad
situation. For <i>if the Institution has been justified in keeping
me here these last eight months, then the same cause for keeping
me still exists, and I shall never be released</i>. As I joined
the procession of the patients when they left the room, I
thought over the real horrors of prison life, which have frequently
been placed before the public. Take all those horrors
and add what you may, the idea, the knowledge, that you are
being treated as insane while in a lunatic asylum with only
lunatics as associates is unparalleled for cruelty; for it dooms
you to be a <i>nonentity!</i> With these horrors before me there
often came a temptation to injure Madam Pike bodily, so as
to rid others, as well as myself, of her <i>unnatural</i> disposition,
not to mention her cruelties. Having resisted the temptation,
I simply continued to note <i>passing events, which I will continue,
for the sake of the brevity which I promised in my introductory
remarks, to relate in rapid succession</i>.


The patient Mrs. M., who instructed me how to make
crosses (Father Time was teaching me how to bear them),
boats, lamp shades and other articles, was to me a wonder, for,
notwithstanding the fact she had been ten years of her life
in asylums, she is a bright, intelligent woman. Naturally I
sought her society. Madam Pike first objected to this and

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During the Lenten season Dr. Salt's assistant joined in
the church music. He sang well, but in a spirit of mischief
I told a patient that the doctor sang through his nose. “Oh,
my!” she said, “he should use his mouth and throat. Doctor
Salt would soon have him locked up.” And she continued
soliloquizing: “I suppose the doctor's assistant will be given
one of the best rooms.”


Long ago I knew Professor Blank, who had, so he told
me, spent a winter in Iceland. He taught me the national
music of that region. When I sang it the patients were delighted,
and one of them remarked: “I rather like that music,
and would enjoy it, but this room is hot enough to roast the
fire, and as that melts such music, give us another song.”
This patient would frequently crawl lengthwise under the
piano, give a peculiar shake of the head, which was really
funny, and then she would exclaim: “Hail Columbia!” or
“it is time to pass around the chicken legs!” The Ladies
Home Journal published the Martha Washington Two-Step.
As it is dedicated to the National Society of the Daughters
of the Revolution, a member of which I am, its pretty music
gave me double pleasure. A loquacious patient questioned me
regarding the patriotic societies. When she had learned the
aim of the societies she commented as follows: “So you
commemorate a fight? Well, I think dancing is the sort of
patriotism best for woman,” and here she danced with surprising
agility.


A copy of the New York Mail and Express was loaned
me. The paper gave a description of walking canes. The
patients looked at the picture of them, and decided that the
owners of them should be here, because they had one idea that
should be caned out of them. Another patient added: “Oh,

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day, while I was playing on the piano, Dr. Salt
entered the room. After greeting the patients--a courtesy
which pleased <i>some</i> of them, for it seemed to raise their hopes
that he thought them sensible enough to be noticed--he asked
me to play the piano for him. In referring later to the selection
I made I informed Madam Pike that “Home, Sweet
Home” was significant; and if this had not won my dismissal
from the Institution, another such request I would play “The
Tempest of the Heart.”


There were shoes in my trunk, but as Madam Pike failed
to let me have the use of them there was nothing left for
me to do but to become my own cobbler. One of the Madams
gave me a piece of cardboard and some strong thread. By
the use of my big darning needle I drew the thread through
the sole of the shoe, and in this manner I secured foot protection.
One of the patients evinced interest in my new occupation;
but a suggestion that I might hang up my shingle
was vetoed; for any amusement we did have was generally
by stealth, and in the midst of it or at the finish we were all
either locked up in our respective rooms or some one or more
of the patients received a thrashing; or Madam Pike would
strike the bridge or side of a patient's nose with the keys.
Never will I forget my first impression of such a use of the
keys, her cruel temper had dictated a double use for them to
inflict pain on others.


Once I overheard two patients trying to settle a dispute
--the supremacy of idle words, expressed incoherently. As
far as I had an opportunity to know the dispute was closed
by one of them telling the other: “It is all right; she could
have her own way, for she certainly was right from her head
up.” It was noticeable that each deemed herself successful in
the dispute. There were grimes on our Hall. I supposed they
were for general use; but Madam only loaned them to several
favored patients. She would neither play with me nor let me

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Any and all questions and answers regarding the hoped-for
dismissal from the Mad-House met from Madam a savage
comment. The word savage is selected because of her manner
and her voice. As an instance, a sweet-minded, gentle
widow spoke to the doctor. Her sweet voice was drowned by
the hoarse tones of the Madam, who in an abrupt, triumphant
manner informed the widow that she could not leave the
asylum until she weighed fully twenty-five pounds more than
she then did. The patient came to me and said she was fifty
years of age, and asked me what chance she had to gain the
twenty-five pounds.


The natural laws of self-protection are instinctively and
practically carried out, even by persons without memory and
reason. More than once, when Madam Pike would irritate
the patients, they would strike out their arms. Such an act,
even if not endangering Madam's person, would be seized
by her as an incentive to treat the patient unmercifully, and
finally to put her in a straight-jacket. That not being enough
she would then tie a pillow-slip over the head of the patient.
The order was given not to put potatoes in the soup. An
absent-minded patient forgot the order, and was in the act of
putting them into the plate, when Madam seized the woman's
hand. The patient turned, and gave Madam a look, saying

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the locusts came in great numbers, a patient was
telling me of a dream she had. “The locusts sang the name
of Pharaoh,” and that she “saw that <i>gentleman</i> surrounded
by locusts, sailing up the Chesapeake Bay and advancing
toward the tomb erected to General Grant.” As the patient
reached this part of her dream Madam Pike passed by and
demanded silence. The teller of the dream hissed her, and
said: “You might let some one have a chat; but the chats
of the earth seem only for you.” When Madam Pike would
meet a patient walking aimlessly she would demand to know
where the patient thought she was going, and charged her
not to dare to go near the <i>water pitcher</i>. On one occasion the
answer was: “I am looking for Faith, Hope and Charity; do
you happen to have any of those attributes?” Any gratification
which the last question afforded me was soon crushed,
for by hard slaps the patient was beaten almost to insensibility.


When the Emperor of Germany sent his brother, Prince
Henry of Prussia, to this country, the latter was much talked
of by the patients. I named embroidered stitches in honor of
His Highness. This caused one of the patients to say that
the emperor would be pleased when he heard that even the
stitches of the sewing-room had been so named. One of the
patients, when excited, would order everybody out of the Hall,
following the order by a threat to call the Law, as she expressed
it, and accompanied by an act of hunting for an officer.
When a patient threw articles out of the window it seemed to
me somewhat just that the grasp of her fingers should be
restricted by mittens; but generally a patient with such traits
is strapped to a chair. One patient had a habit of crawling
lengthwise under the piano, but when she discovered that the
chair was an obstacle, she said: “This chair is indeed like
politics, for some men,--it stands in the way of progress.”

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

EASTER.


This is the day of a happy morn. The sunlit air ringing
with the sound of sweet bells. In the morning the Divine
Services were celebrated with special solemnity and the joyous
music of hallelujah. The patients marked the day by adding
to their costumes the flowery emblems of Easter. Returning
from the Chapel I decided to give my room a festive touch by
making crosses out of the palm received on Palm Sunday.
While engaged in this occupation my thoughts were distracted
by watching the beauties of the sky, the dancing of the sunbeams,
while the strains of the music box poured out the
hymn of the Feast, and the canary bird joined with its tender
trilling in the general harmony of spring and Easter. While
taking recreation in the grove I paid a visit to my friends
the rabbits, carrying with me my Easter gifts of selected
grasses and herbs. Owing to the mildness of the winter, all
nature was awakening to pay tribute to the joyous Eastertide!


In the afternoon I sang for the patients a ballad entitled
“Johnny Sands,” which tells of a quarrel between a man and
his wife. When it came to the part where the wife was left
drowning in the water, as the result of a trick she intended
to play on her husband, several of them clapped their hands

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On <i>Picnic Day For Our Hall</i> several of the patients inquired
of me: “Do you think Madam Pike will permit us to
laugh, talk, take a row on the lake, use the swing, and seek such
pastimes as the patients on the other Halls are permitted to
do?” As these questions arose a melancholy doubt and a
laugh were excited in me. Charles Dickens, Dean Swift and
Mark Twain, lend me your descriptive powers to do justice
to the management of this picnic. In the first place the poor
dying consumptive was incased in a straight-jacket, then placed
on a chair and told to be quiet. Several patients whose interest
in life was solely centered in their surroundings were
physically able to go, but were not invited to do so. Their
regrets threw a damper over the feelings of those who were
invited. The patients knew that Madam Pike did not wish
any one to talk with me. No one was permitted to converse
with Mrs. C, or Mrs. M., both being particularly companionable
persons. It was under these depressing conditions the
journey to the picnic grounds commenced. The patients were
quiet, they walked slowly, and in a straight line. Not finding
any favorable opportunity to make my escape, I did the same.
As we advanced the blossoms of the chestnut tree overtopped
the choice plants, flowers and shrubbery of the grounds. The
song of the birds and the balm of the atmosphere made the
day only equaled by another beautiful day in June. The
lesser and smaller flowers seemed to be paying their homage
to the rose, their queen. This suggested to me the relating of
the plot “The Opera of Flowers,” which is as follows: One
time the flowers held a meeting. A dispute arose as to which
of them should be chosen queen. The heather-bell and others
asserted their rights by claiming to be the first flowers to hail

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I asked so frequently to be allowed to return home that
Madam Pike ordered a straight-jacket to be put on me. This
is a close-fitting garment made of strong linen. Its sleeves
are of sufficient length to cover the entire hand, and are sewed
up as mits, or a bag. By means of lacing down the front, and
strapping the arms across the body of the patient, she or he
became helpless. I was then put in a side room, and, as good
fortune favored me, I found myself in the room adjoining
that of the blind girl, who was talking at that time to another
patient. She announced that she had been in the one room
for four years; was not allowed to enter church, nor to take
outdoor exercise. She was trying, she said, to save her soul
and be reconciled to her imprisonment. That Madam kept
her well dressed, but doomed her to live alone. I had a way
of watching my chance to converse with her. She did not
seem crazy, but at times she was very cross. She frequently
expressed a wish to leave the insane.


Protecting the carpet of the hall was a narrow linen cover.

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the end of the hall were placed two rocking chairs.
No one was allowed to use them. If the patients happened
to transgress this order the result was similar to those which
I have mentioned regarding the carpet. “Ye banks and braes
of Bonnie Doone!” What temper was exhibited on the part
of Madam when a patient declared those chairs were like pig
tails, more ornamental than useful! It is right to care for
household effects, but is it fair to surround the insane and
those physically afflicted with effects that must be cared for
even at the expense of the patients' nerves, or by the art of
nursing? No. And the other Madams neither think nor act
on such a basis.


On the Fourth of July a large American flag was placed
on its pole. At night, through the iron bars of the windows,
the display of fireworks set off by the neighbors could be seen.
I knelt in the window with the patient whom I met making
my bed the morning after my arrival.


I asked for a prayer book, but Madam permitted me to
have the use of one for only about two months.


For about eight months my orders from Madam Pike
were that I should stay in my room, not take exercise on the
Hall, and not to talk to any of the patients who happened to
come to my door. In other words, excepting the four hours,

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The letters I wrote to her a later date ran thus:


MY MOST CHERISHED FRIEND:


What is the cause of your silence? Rheumatism in your
wrist? If so, I ask you to have some one write for you. If
any other cause has produced silence on your part, then I
cannot imagine just what the cause can be; but for my peace
of mind I must hope that nothing more serious than a painful
wrist has prevented you from writing me. Again, for consolation,
I throw myself into philosophical thoughts, and conclude
that “No news is good news.” It is in this last state of mind
that I now address you. London and its disappointment regarding
the coronation of King Edward, as well as the King's
illness, has no doubt claimed much of your attention, as it has
the people of the world. It is to be hoped by all that the King
will soon be well, and the arrangements for future glory will
take the place of anxiety. I trust when the affair does occur
that you will be able to enjoy a large share of the festivities.
The magazines you send me are very consoling; there are
pages of their contents which I intend making into a separate
booklet. As you direct these magazines to me, there is a

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

July 7th, 1902.


I had no sooner finished the letter when my attention was
attracted by acts on the part of Madam Pike similar to those
which I have told in the preceding pages; but on this occasion
one of the patients amused me by calling out “Police, police!”
Here the Empress of the Hall suddenly declared she would no
longer bear with her noisy subjects. This patient, who claimed
to be Queen, Empress, and Creator, was a young and slender
woman. She would stand for months in silence, and gesticulate;
then suddenly break out in dramatic speech. In this mood
she never failed to attract an audience, even the Madams would
leave their occupation to join us. Here is a description of
how she said she created the different sections of our country.
In choice language she decalred as follows: “I created the
North, and left it cold and desolate. The South was my last
work.” There was a shout from the audience, and she continued:
“And its skies and lands revelled faultless beauties.
The cold-hearted people of the North came and shed blood;
and even the crows begged for food. After that disgrace to
the country I had created, I placed heavy clouds in the sky
to show my displeasure. I came here,” she continued, “for
a rest. Before coming I locked up all the houses on the earth
and brought the keys of their doors with me. This house is
mine. You are, all of you, my servants; I will chastise you
if you make so bold as to address me. <i>I dismiss yon all.”</i>
