BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that's fine, we'll just, just start.  So fill me in, how you doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	What's been happening?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, not much of anything really.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	"Um, getting ready, the kids ready for school, but —	"
<b>DR:</b>	Didn't they start already?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was a little stressful getting there.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, okay.  Everything else is kind of the same, still a little anxious about the, uh, eye thing.
<b>DR:</b>	What's happening with that?
<b>PT:</b>	I go back.  Uh, as a matter of fact, they just changed my appointment.  I go back on the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	To, um, and I requested to see the first doctor that I saw instead of the one who did the laser surgery.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	There's not enough bedside manner for me—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Very cut and dry, you know, doesn't explain, not that he doesn't explain.  He's just very, and that makes me more anxious.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	So I'm going to see the first one who actually diagnosed the problem and see what he thinks of the surgeries—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That I've had.  So that's where we are with that.  I have to wait apparently 3 months before they, I guess it starts to heal.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, how are you seeing now?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay, um, as a matter of fact, I have to go get a new lens in this one.  I went to the eye doctor and had them, you know, because this one changed a little bit, um, but she did get me back into contacts, um, which are okay, but it just, it irritates it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's better.  I can see with those better.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you still kind of like preoccupied and checking your focusing?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I was okay for a while.  Yeah, I was okay for a while—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But now I still do this, you know, check my peripheral vision, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How's it come out?
<b>PT:</b>	Some days, okay, and I don't know, it's weird, some days it's okay and some days it seems cloudy, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, not that I can't see, but it's not as, there's like a little shadow sort of, um, and I don't know if that's always going to be like that, or it just takes a while for it to heal.  I—
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	I would imagine it does.
<b>DR:</b>	Most surgeries take some time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, so when you see this guy, he's going to tell you apparently.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm preparing my list of questions.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, I don't know if it's a good idea for you to—
<b>PT:</b>	Do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I don't, I don't know.  I think, I worry you're going to make yourself nuts, and—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know if you're going to get an accurate, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Reading on—
<b>DR:</b>	Perception, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But, you know, it all depends when you do that, it depends on the lighting in the room and, you know, if you're getting—
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	If you're getting more light from this side than, you know, yeah, I shouldn't do that, but—
<b>DR:</b>	I go through a similar thing after I go to a loud concert.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I have ringing and I wear the foam earpieces, like I went to see Springsteen—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Last month, or 2 months ago, and I wear the foam earpieces, which most people don't.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'm usually not in the front because we never have good tickets, and still it's so frigging loud—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And it always upsets me, and I only go to a few, there's not many I'll go to anymore because I'm afraid.  I need to hear.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And so I get that kind of ringing and congestion for a few days—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'm freaked out.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Did I harm myself?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and the smart part of me would just know to stop doing that, to just—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	That it's a temporary thing.  It'll go away.  It's happened before and, you know, I am using more precaution than most people—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And but the crazy part of me is always like I don't think I'm hearing as well.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I think I'm turning up the TV more.  So, it's good if you can stop—
<b>PT:</b>	Stop doing it.
<b>DR:</b>	Checking and checking and checking and checking.  If you find yourself doing that, you're making yourself more anxious.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, I think if it was something big, you'd notice it, but those things distinct—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Things are very hard to—
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's, I think it's going to be—
<b>DR:</b>	Evaluate yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	It's going to be, you know, like that, you know, in and out and especially if it, you know, it's not completely reattaching.  Maybe it never will be.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, maybe it'll always be like that, and I think, you know, the eye's a funny thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	My greatest fear is, is not being able to see, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and catching it before it goes to the point of having to go through that surgery again—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Which I thought was gruelish and nightmarish.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	They got to come up with something better—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	In this day and age, but it certainly wasn't an experience I'd really like to live through again.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't highly recommend it.
<b>PT:</b>	No.  To anyone.  Well, I do only if they'll put you out and leave you out.  I don't understand the, the waking you up part.
<b>DR:</b>	But the flip side is 100 years ago they couldn't have helped you.
<b>PT:</b>	Well that's true.  That's true.
<b>DR:</b>	I wonder about that all the time.  People walked around with a lot more problems I think—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	At our age because they—
<b>PT:</b>	There was no help.
<b>DR:</b>	They couldn't fix those things.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, it's good and they caught it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, you know, they had a good treatment for it.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's not something I'd recommend.
<b>DR:</b>	No.  Not something—
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I did go for the blood work you sent me finally.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	For the thyroid.  Did they send that to you?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, you know what, let me see.  Yes.  Yes, and everything was normal.
<b>PT:</b>	It was normal.
<b>DR:</b>	Yep, exactly normal.  So that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	It doesn't make sense.  Well yeah.  I mean it's good, but it doesn't explain why I'm so tired and can't get off the couch.  I just don't have that, I truly think it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, does it vary?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Sometime.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think that the Zoloft is playing a role here?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b>	You take it in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Switched that to lunch.
<b>DR:</b>	To lunch, and we went through the whole—
<b>PT:</b>	Yep, we went through nighttime.  We went through morning time.
<b>DR:</b>	And this is what we landed at?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But you don't feel it's tiring you during the day?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Wellbutrin you take first thing in the morning?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, and the Xanax you take?
<b>PT:</b>	Kind of towards dinnertime.
<b>DR:</b>	Towards dinner.  So we don't suspect that that's tiring you during the day?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	I wouldn't think so because—
<b>PT:</b>	It's just a very strange, and I don't know if it has something to do with, you know, not sleeping, you know, because usually I'm up—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	At some point during the night.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, but I get up and I just, I'm up and I get them ready for school now, you know, whatever, and then by 10:00 I want to sit down and take a nap already.  And then about 2:00, 3:00, that's when I get my spark to, and then I'm up 9:00, I can do whatever, at night.  I'm sort of like a baby that has, um, their nights and days reversed, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	Remind me why we arrived at 12:00 on the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b>	The Zoloft, because you said take it at night and then I thought that was making me tired in the morning, like if I took it at dinnertime—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	It was making me tired.  So then—
<b>DR:</b>	We're trying to have it peak in the evening.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So I was, I started taking it in the morning.  I don't know why I moved it to lunchtime to be honest with you.  I was taking them both in the morning and that seemed to be just fine.  I don't see a big changes between taking it—
<b>DR:</b>	But if you take it at night, you have trouble getting up in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	So that suggests that it is making you a little tired, but the tiredness should peak with the peak blood level which is—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe 6 hours after you take it.  So, and you're—
<b>PT:</b>	And that might be enough.
<b>DR:</b>	Not describing getting tired at dinnertime.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like reverse.
<b>DR:</b>	It's reversed.
<b>PT:</b>	Of, of, uh.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean it's possible, these medicines have more than one effect or side effect.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It is possible, and I've had people who, for a number of hours after taking a certain medicine, feel a little elevated—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Or energized.  And then for a number of hours they feel more tired.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It's possible to experience that.
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	But you feel that taking it at noon is the best compromise—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That you've arrived at.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's not really late in the day.  It's early in the day that you're most tired.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You take the Xanax at dinnertime.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	What happens if you took the Xanax at noon?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I tried it that way.  Then I think by 6:00 I might—
<b>DR:</b>	Then you're conking out.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You've tried that already?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I tried, I tried to get so that in that 6 hours like it's bedtime, you know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE] at 10:00 at night.
<b>DR:</b>	And that is a single slow release pill that is marketed as once a day.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Although I have a lot of people take it twice.
<b>PT:</b>	I only take it once.
<b>DR:</b>	And it sounds to me like it does, that does make you tired when it peaks, and we use that for, for bedtime.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Taking it at dinner to help people fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b>	And maybe it's just my system that it just doesn't, or it has nothing to do with the medication, and, and it's all related to—
<b>DR:</b>	And it might not.  I just want to make sure—
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	We're not making things worse.  I mean I'm happy with the Wellbutrin in the morning.  I'm happy with the Xanax in the evening, and Zoloft I think I'd be curious for you to try that in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	For a couple of days.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And if you think that's worse, then go back to what you're doing.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I mean does it have to do with you once the kids are off to school, you know?
<b>PT:</b>	It seems like the minute I sit down.  If I sit there for more than 10 minutes, it's, I'm done.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  Then I'll have to take my, you know, a little power nap, which I always did.  I mean taking a little 10, 20 minutes like after lunch is not, I mean I've done that for as long as I can remember.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, um, this just seems to be it's hitting like in the, well it could be, because sometimes it could be twice a day, but I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Is there any role for like a cup of coffee or a glass, a cup of tea?
<b>PT:</b>	If I have coffee, if I have 2 cups of coffee, I don't, that doesn't happen.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And then I'm good like most of, like through the afternoon.  Then I won't.
<b>DR:</b>	So if you have stuff to do, you actually do do that?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's, you know, if I know I have to absolutely, uh, that I have to do something, yeah, but if I sit down and read the paper, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	And that doesn't make you anxious to have 2 cups of coffee?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>PT:</b>	So I try not to do too much caffeine.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Because, yeah, then it'll have, I'll get the palpations, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And then that freaks me out, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	So is 1 cup a compromise or 1 cup doesn't do anything?
<b>PT:</b>	One cup won't do anything.  Well, you know what, it depends, it depends on the day because I think it all depends on how tired physically I am, but sometimes 1 cup will kick it in and other times no.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it also have to do if you have stuff going on, you're busy, you're active?  I mean can override it if you have stuff going on?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  If, if, if it's something crucial, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	If it's something that I put off, procrastinate, put it off.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  I'll say all right, I'll do it later.  Oh, I can do it tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and then if I really stick to that, I will.  If I get up and start moving, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I can, I can overcome it, you know.  Um, I don't know.  Or like I said, it has nothing to do with anything and it's just that, you know, I thought it was the thyroid, but some of it fits that and some of it doesn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Your thyroid's—
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely fine.
<b>PT:</b>	Doing fine.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	I mean even if it were, you know, low normal I'd say well, but it's dead center, which is good.  I will tell you that sometimes we augment the treatment of depression with a very small dose of thyroid supplement, but I don't feel like that would be the right thing here because you're not describing depression.  You're just describing fatigue and we're not sure why.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And all the blood tests are normal.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, some people are higher energy people than others.  Um, is there a way to build in exercise early in the day to kind of get you moving?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I really should.
<b>DR:</b>	Get you, um—
<b>PT:</b>	Get me moving.  I should go back to, well, now that the weather's changing, I'll go back to my walking.
<b>DR:</b>	That would be good.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, in the morning after they—
<b>DR:</b>	That would be very good.
<b>PT:</b>	They're gone.
<b>DR:</b>	If you got them out and then you walked.  I'd be interested to see how that helped things.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, a little bit of caffeine is okay.  There's an expensive medicine called Provigel that was touted as helping people with daytime fatigue.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It's controversial now because it's expensive and some people don't feel it's necessarily much different than a little bit of coffee, so—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I wouldn't, you know, we could consider that, but I would try the natural, you know.  I would try, the walking would be excellent, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Some days I just feel like I'm in a fog, you know.  You just, you just—
<b>DR:</b>	But when you did walk, did you feel better?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Before all this crap started.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that is the one thing, not that it's a treatment for depression—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Or anything like that per se.  The one thing that they uniformly find is helpful, you know, when they really look at it.  It's not going to, on its own, treat severe depression.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But it always seems to add some benefit.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	To alertness, energy—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	To mental acuity and mood, everything.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So that'll be good.
<b>PT:</b>	I'll try that.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have good sneakers?  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I just bought myself a new pair.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I would try that, and then you're maybe then you're primed for the day, then you're, you know, you're up and out.  I'd try that before we try another medication.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	I got something from the pharmacy, I think nagging us to switch to generic Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, tell them to go away.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so that's that.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't want to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	See and I must have [INAUDIBLE] some of, um, I don't know.  I didn't even think of it, maybe it's the Lopressor, you know, that I take for the high blood pressure.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Do some of—
<b>DR:</b>	That is—
<b>PT:</b>	Make me tired.
<b>DR:</b>	You know what, that's dumb because I, I wasn't thinking about the other medicines that you're on because that absolutely could do it.  How much are, of that are you on?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, it's a lot.  It's like 300 mg a day.  I take 150 in the morning and 150, and I, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	So 150 twice.  Ding, ding, ding, that's a big dose.
<b>PT:</b>	Yep, and it doesn't, not that it's not controlling my blood pressure, but, um, you know, I've taken it at various times during the day and it's, you know, it runs like 130/75 whatever.  That top number seems to be, you know, a little higher than it should, and I'm not so sure.
<b>DR:</b>	It's really the lower number that's—
<b>PT:</b>	That's important.
<b>DR:</b>	Mostly of concern—
<b>PT:</b>	Because—
<b>DR:</b>	You know, borderline hypertension is 140/90.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So if you have a lower number, 70, 80, that's good.  That's good.  So I think it is working, but I wasn't looking at your other meds—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm thinking that might be where the tiredness is coming in because the dose is so high.
<b>DR:</b>	That is a high dose.  Is it possible, for example, for them to give you 100 in the am, 200 in the pm?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't know.  I never asked.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, or even—
<b>PT:</b>	But I, I think that's the next—
<b>DR:</b>	A hundred twice a day.  I mean maybe, maybe if you were walking and you lost a few pounds, could they, they reduce it a little bit?
<b>PT:</b>	I would hope so.
<b>DR:</b>	Something like that.
<b>PT:</b>	See they upped it because I was still getting those, um, those spikes.  I would get the spike—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	In the blood pressure and the spike in the heart rate.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So when they increased it, those things stopped, and I haven't gotten those.  However, I'm not so sure that this is the way to leave me because I think that now that it's been maybe a year and a half on that dose, um, maybe they should try that and something else.  You know, use two different medications as opposed to one big dose of one.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, or maybe, maybe—
<b>PT:</b>	Or switch something.
<b>DR:</b>	Or maybe that you've been good for a year.  Maybe they could—
<b>PT:</b>	Try to reduce it.
<b>DR:</b>	Decrease it a little bit because yes, that's a big dose of the beta blocker.  People will feel tired on that.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And—
<b>PT:</b>	And I noticed when you just brought up the generic stuff, now I used to take one, I had taken generic form of that.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Now it used to be one little oblong pill that I didn't feel too bad on.  Now when we switched pharmacies again in the beginning of this year, I had to go back to the blue ones, and the blue ones seem to be the ones that make me, I don't know, that's when all the tiredness started after they switched generics again.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you can, if you identify, this happens a lot because absolutely, they'll change from one generic to another—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's a whole new ballgame.  So one option is insisting on the brand if you find that's better.  If you find that there's a generic that works just as well as the brand, if you look on the pill bottle, it'll actually say the generic manufacturer.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I, I would say if you want me to come here, I need you to keep this one in stock.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, it might cost them $1 more or something.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It doesn't matter.  If that's the one that you feel good on, that's the one you should insist on getting.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah because I know it's not necessarily the named medication, but it's all the other crap they put in there, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	One generic to another can differ markedly.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  The only way you know that you're getting always the same thing is being on the brand, or—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, if you identify a generic that you like, just sticking with that—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	That same maker.
<b>PT:</b>	Well that's why, that's why I refused to do that.  I'd rather get the name brand.
<b>DR:</b>	Well in my field, it's very critical.  I, I definitely have seen people do less well on the generics.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So if their insurance allows them to do that, and it's not too much of a difference—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Then I'd prefer it, but I do the same thing.  There are people that they cannot afford the branded medicine if there's a generic available, but then if we do identify one that they're doing well on—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	We try and have them stick with that one.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I had a guy who was on a similar medicine to Zoloft, and, you know, it's when they switched it, he [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	He, you know, they worked it out, but they always had that, that one for him.  So I would do.  I would try to go back—
<b>PT:</b>	Because I think that—
<b>DR:</b>	I mean it would be a nice experiment to go back to that Lopressor and see if you felt better.
<b>PT:</b>	If it would nice if I kept the bottle though.  I don't think I have it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	But they may know if I describe what the pill looks like, they might know.  I don't know if they know the, you know, the generic brand name.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you might be able to look it up—
<b>PT:</b>	Is there something online?
<b>DR:</b>	On the internet.  Someone described a pill to me.  They said the generic name and then it had like L 32 or something on it—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I Googled that, and sure enough it popped up.
<b>PT:</b>	Hmm.
<b>DR:</b>	Now—
<b>PT:</b>	I'll [INAUDIBLE] because sometimes I'll put them in my pocket, like carry them in my purse, put them in pill bottles.  I'll have to see if I have any older—
<b>DR:</b>	See if you have any left—
<b>PT:</b>	Left and see what it looks like.
<b>DR:</b>	Or you can go to different pharmacies and say show me your generic Lopressor.  I'm trying to find one.
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b>	No, I'm serious.  You know, I think that you're going through something like having hypothyroidism that you're kind of tired all the time—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I can't imagine being on 300 mg a day of, of a beta blocker.  That's, that is a high dose.  I'm not saying that you don't need it, but I'm saying that—
<b>PT:</b>	No, but—
<b>DR:</b>	If you can find one that you feel better on—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You should definitely do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Or, or they can, you know.  I used to take Prinivil which was, I was on 20 mg before all this crap started.  So I wasn't on as high, I don't know if I should ask them to switch back to that.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	With a little higher dose or—
<b>DR:</b>	Each medication has [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	It's different, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, but if you—
<b>PT:</b>	But I know that too when they switched that to the generic, that's when I started to like, um, develop uh, gastric reflux from, and that's the only medication I was taking at the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	So, I'm, I'm very sensitive sometimes to those generic things.
<b>DR:</b>	See I don't know enough about treating blood pressure to know whether you could be treated with a different type of medicine.  There's other types of medicines they use.
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	Calcium channel blockers, ace inhibitors that don't have the same reputation of causing tiredness as beta blockers.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	But I would, I would say let's make this a project that either finding that generic that you liked.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And or talking with your doctor about this is really interfering, that you're tired all day and, and is there another option.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Can you do something different to combine this medicine, a little less of this medicine with something else.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And be less tired.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I would do that.  I think that's a big deal.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah because I don't think it's, it's what, you know, the stuff that we're using.
<b>DR:</b>	That was, my only thought was the Zoloft, but you know, I was dumb because I, I forgot to look at the other medicines that you're taking.  I had forgotten that you were on those things.
<b>PT:</b>	And the combination of the two maybe just, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	And Xanax could be adding a little bit.  The Zoloft could be adding a little bit.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean with the Lopressor, just if they interact with each other.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	The tiredness comes.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I would say that the Wellbutrin a little bit can slow the breakdown of a medicine like Lopressor.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And being on the Wellbutrin plus the Lopressor might give you essentially a higher level of the Lopressor.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And—
<b>PT:</b>	I should see if he'd cut back on it.
<b>DR:</b>	You're not getting fainty or lightheaded or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, but I mean then there's times that I feel that way like loopy, um.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme that breaks down Lopressor.  So, um, so it might be that you could get away with a little bit lower dose.  Maybe you could be on 100 twice.  I'd be interested in that.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'd also be interested in switching to the one that, for some reason, the way it released—
<b>PT:</b>	It didn't do, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Didn't make you as tired.  Let me double check that.  I know Toprol is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I stopped taking that one.
<b>DR:</b>	The enzyme.
<b>PT:</b>	I have some of those left still actually.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, I have it here somewhere.  Here it is.  So Lopressor, what's the generic name for that?
<b>PT:</b>	Metoprolol.
<b>DR:</b>	Metoprolol?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Is it metoprolol?
<b>DR:</b>	Toprol.  I though that was, Toprol was metoprolol.
<b>PT:</b>	Toprol I think, Toprol XL is the brand name I think of the extended release.
<b>DR:</b>	Well let me see.
<b>PT:</b>	Metoprolol or however you say it.  I probably have it written down.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, you're right.  I didn't realize they're both metoprolol.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So yes, I am pretty sure that that's broken down by the enzyme.  Let me just check that, 2D6.  Yeah, metoprolol, yep.  So, and if we look under inhibitors and we look up 2D6, we'll see bupropion.  So, when did we add the Wellbutrin?  This is interesting.  Added about 9 months ago.  This is a stretch.  I'd be happy to talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].  Um, I'll write it down on a card.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That you're on a modest dose of Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But it could be driving your blood pressure medication level a little higher.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And you are tired and there is a role for trying to increase it.  Could he go to 100 twice a day—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And then, you know, monitor your blood pressure and see.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so I'm going to write that down.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And then you need Zoloft and Xanax I think, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, um, Wellbutrin [INAUDIBLE].  Let's try it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It might make a big difference.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So I wrote that little—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Note on your card.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I'll mail them in.  They'll probably call you again or write you another letter.
<b>DR:</b>	You mean to change—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	From branded.  Yeah, that's fine.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I said, I've had that reaction with other generics.  I don't want to, I don't want to mess around because I don't think it's that.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, if it's not a big price difference for you.  It's a big price difference for them.
<b>PT:</b>	As long as, as long as you, you check that little box.
<b>DR:</b>	Do not substitute.
<b>PT:</b>	It's $80 for, for—
<b>DR:</b>	For the 3 months.
<b>PT:</b>	Three months or whatever it is, for 90 days.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean we all end up paying for this eventually, so—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	If the medicine's working just as well on the generic and you stick with that versus a generic, I'm fine with that too, but, um, I don't know enough about the generic, uh, Zoloft and we'd, we'd have to try it.
<b>PT:</b>	Why be a guinea pig.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I think they're finding more and more about these, um, I didn't know that they didn't have to be FDA regulated.  I mean those generics don't go through the same testing as the original.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, it's not exactly true.  They do have to achieve, my understanding is 80% bioequivalence compared to the, that's a big difference and that's average.  So it might be that branded Zoloft, you get a level of 100 let's say.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And generic you might get a level of, uh, of 80.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know.  So that's a big difference—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Because there's a threshold effect with these medicines, but I've seen lots of time people switch to the generic and they don't do as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, um—
<b>PT:</b>	I've heard that.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and that's average.  So average means they're within 20% average, but a given individual might even have a wider swing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, like a 30 or 40%—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Swing.  It's possible.  Uh, so it could happen.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It could definitely happen.  It matters a lot in medications where the blood level is critical.  Antibiotics they give you a dose that would be sometimes a couple of times what you really, really needed to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Just to be on the safe side, but with all medicines you're just on enough and so if it drops down, it can make a difference.  I've seen even when people didn't realize it, and they didn't notice that they were on a generic, and they didn't think about it, and they just came in and said I'm not doing as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Hmm.
<b>DR:</b>	And they didn't even suspect that because the pharmacist said it's exactly the same.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And we changed back to brand and they did happen.  So I've seen it happen.
<b>PT:</b>	Hmm.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's brand name Xanax XR too, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so this is 3 months, put 74 on both.  Okay.  All right, so I would talk to your doctor, and, uh, maybe there's a role in decreasing it.  Certainly you ought to be on the one that you like.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's it.  Shut this off.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, let's try another one other than that little blue one, little blue one.
