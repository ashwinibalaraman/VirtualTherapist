A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situations
of the human male. (de Beauvior, 1953/1976, p. xv)


Ms. Beauvior was correct... in 1953. Let's face it, one only writes about
the plight of people who are recognized as suffering or discriminated
against in some way. Although male writers have certainly portrayed
individual men in painful, tragic situations, from Job in the Bible to Willie
Loman in "Death of a Salesman," there has been until recently almost
nothing written about the "peculiar situation of the human male."


Feminism and the women's movement have forced males to notice that
there is a male condition. Women's issues have received so much press and
exposure that all but only the most unaware males could help reflecting on
their place in the world and/ or the quality of their lives. In the past men did
not think much about such things. They were faced with issues related to
surviving and getting ahead. Today, most men come from traditional
families where fathers were breadwinners and mothers were homemakers
and part-time workers.


The traditional male models of work that most men have introjected are
now colliding with other societal realities of the 1980s such as the demands
and conflicts of dual-career marriages; the integration of women into
traditional male occupations; changes in technology; new expectations
about balancing work with family relationships; and the stress of
maintaining the traditional male belief that occupational success equals
high self-esteem.


This collision of traditional male values with these new forces is a source

[p. <i>69</i>]

The challenge of these traditional male paradigms and values strikes at
the heart of masculinity. The result is that men are anxious and confused. It
is a time of action and reaction: Often they are asked, told, even mandated
to make changes instigated by women.


These "forced" changes can generate anger and fear in men because
there is so much at stake. With most of their identity tied up in career, they
feel that they have more to lose. In addition, they are being asked by women
to make changes that are not traditionally male or valued by other men.
Essentially they have to learn about living more intimately and cooperatively
with their wives and children.


Since more counselors are increasingly confronted with male clients
who are affected by these societal changes, it is important that they
appreciate these male dilemmas and refrain from focusing entirely on the
intrapsychic world of their clients. This chapter is aimed at developing an
understanding of both the internal and external forces that shape and
influence men's work-related lives, so that counselors can more comprehensively
treat men with career-related concerns.


<b>Self-Estem, Status, and
Upward Mobility</b>


If self-esteem is connected with respecting
oneself, feeling positively toward oneself, and thinking that one is
worthy and useful, then it would follow logically that those people whose
definition of success is the most narrow are at the greatest risk of becoming
anxious, disillusioned, and unfulfilled. Many men fall into this category.
For most men, work success accounts for most of their sense of selfworth/esteem
(Goldberg, 1977; Morgan, Skovholt and Orr, 1979; Pleck,
1981).


Since much of men's self-esteem and gender identification is measured in
terms of what they do, it is understandable that men are obsessed with
achievement and success (O'Neil, 1981). Although the degree to which
these male values affect men's career and personal development varies
depending on age, social class, ethnic background, and gender-role
socialization, few men escape the strain and conflict of pursuing
"manliness."

[p. <i>70</i>]

Besides the narrowness of the success formula, the king-of-the-hill
aspect of the pursuit is stressful and exhausting. No one is or can be really
secure in a competitively based world. In Alan Sillitoe's short story, "The
Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner," the main protagonist, a crosscountry
runner, states, "All I knew was that you had to run, run, run,
without knowing why you were running, but on you went ... and the
winning post was no end to it... because on you had to go" (Sillitoe, 1971,
pp. 37-38).


This short quote contains much of what constitutes gender-role strain
and conflict in men. Since men's sense of maleness is so dependent upon
getting somewhere without being allowed to stop and savor what they have
achieved, it is no wonder that men with one eye on the winning post and the
other looking over their shoulder, are more emotionally distant and
anxious than women.


This seems to be a pretty grim picture of how men live. One might
wonder why most men don't recognize their condition and become more
proactive about changing it. But the fact is that much of manliness is
associated with enduring pain and suffering. As Osherson in his work
<i>Finding Our Fathers</i> (1986, p. 64) states, "Many men learn from their
fathers that to be in the work world means to suffer, indeed that manhood
itself is a kind of dreadful obligation."


Paradoxically, men have felt a sense of masculine pride in their suffering
as breadwinners. In the past, even if their jobs were unheroic and
uninteresting, they could at least feel that supporting the family was man's
work. Essentially, men have been united by sharing perseverance and
sweat. However, with the large influx of women in the workplace, this
"privilege" of the breadwinner's role has been reduced. There are fewer and
fewer domains that men can label as "man's."


As tenuous as it might have been, maintaining and keeping women at
home enhanced men's sense of self-worth and made them feel like more of a
man because it made them unlike women. This aspect of male socialization
is critical to men's sense of self-esteem: Much of what passes for
masculinity is a reaction to femininity. Being a man means being unlike a
woman. Much of being male is based upon not being certain things, that is,
avoiding feelings, behaviors, awarenesses, and activities that might evoke
unmanly responses (Gerzon, 1982; Jourard, 1971; Liss-Levinson, 1981;
O'Neil, 1981; Skovholt &amp; Hansen, 1980).


The constriction of the male role makes men even more vulnerable
concerning their work. In this adult variation of king-of-the-hill, the real
truth is that few men ever "make it." Those who do get there live in dull fear
and apprehension and those who are looking upward feel a sense of failure
because they can't get there. The truth is that there are only so many spots
at the top. As Harris (1986, p. 8) has noted, "Most [men] work in jobs where
they cannot live out the ‘American Dream’ as portrayed by the media. The
number of individuals in professional white collar occupations account for

[p. <i>71</i>]

Even highly educated men have aspirations that don't fit with the reality
of available top level positions. There are only so many prestigious schools,
organizations, and firms; consequently, these men are forever struggling
for the limited positions available. This highly competitive struggle is not
only stressful and unhealthy, it is more often than not discouraging and
dispiriting. Furthermore, without support and communication from other
men, men will continue to feel inadequate, internalizing their "failure,"
assuming they must be at fault or that someone else is to blame.


Failing to see the Horatio Alger myth for what it is, men will continue to
work harder and experience fatigue, stress, illness, and ongoing disillusionment.
The blind circuitousness of this process perpetuates a demoralizing
sense in men that life is meaningless and empty.


Although most men don't literally think that winning and getting ahead
are a matter of life and death, the fact is that most men <i>behave</i> that way.
The tendency to compete and push so strongly and doggedly comes from a
view that one is either a winner or a loser. This strong focus on winning is
not only the result of connecting masculinity with competing, but is linked
with men's fear of being feminine. As Tooley (1977, p. 191) has stated,
"Fear of emasculation, whether expressed as the boyhood fear of
castration or the grownup male fear of impotence, remains the core
organizer of adult male life experience."


The interaction of these two forces is very potent. The key phrase "core
organizer," stresses that much of this behavior is unconsciously embedded
in the male psyche so that men are driven by the fear of not being potent.
Their lives revolve around avoiding the feminine sides of themselves
because they associate feminine behaviors with weakness—that is,
impotence.


This obsession with winning and upward mobility also means that men
cannot feel good about themselves if they choose to stay where they are.
They cannot appreciate who they are or what they are doing. A part of the
need to achieve is the drive to accumulate visible symbols of success in the
form of prestigious positions, beautiful homes, expensive cars, and other
wordly goods. These are symbols to him and the world that he is successful
and moving forward.


Since much of masculinity is predicated on accumulating these symbols,
rather than on feeling intrinsically rewarded, it is almost a cliche to note
that competent, satisfied workers "advance" to positions of greater prestige

[p. <i>72</i>]

These career-related binds are costly and complex, colliding in men's
psyches, rendering them frightened, confused, and threatened. O'Neil
(1981) notes that this constant male role conflict and overload often causes
men to implode at work and explode at home, resulting in family violence
and discord. The opposite may also be true. Unable to feel competent at
home, a man brings his discontent to work. Other writers (Crites &amp;
Fitzgerald, 1980; Harrison, 1978; Korzman, 1986) have documented and
discussed the extent to which men's health is threatened by these work-
related conflicts and demands, showing that men greatly exceed women in
stress-related deaths and illnesses.


<b>Balancing Work
and Other Priorities</b>


As previously stated, the male paradigm
emphasizes invulnerability and independence to such an extent that
men are often isolated from friends and family; consequently, males often
ignore learning and caring about intimacy. They continue to look toward
work and career to fulfill personal needs. But turning toward work doesn't
meet most men's needs for intimacy and it further distances them from
significant others simply because they are not around enough to relate.


Unable to rectify their discontent and to understand their predicament,
they often seek solace and pride in their suffering. Although much of this
suffering is real, it is also a shield from the demands of others for intimacy,
a way to legitimize distance and noninvolvement (Druck &amp; Simmons,
1985). A wife and children can hardly criticize a man for supporting them
and making their lives more comfortable.


One of the most difficult questions men have to deal with is whether they
can be both ambitious at work and successful as a father and partner. For
men who are trying to "make it" at work, the job usually comes first, family
second. Several authors have discussed the conflicts men have between
work and family, and how the need for task completion can be a detriment
to relationship maintenance and really "being there" for one's children
(Berger &amp; Wright, 1978; Goldberg, 1977; Nichols, 1975; Osherson, 1986;
Pleck &amp; Sawyer, 1974).


Male socialization and role conflicts aside, it is important to understand
how hard most people must work just to make ends meet. Work for many
men often leaves them too tired to manage a social life, unless it's handed to
them when they get home. Some men consider it a luxury to be able to focus
on things <i>other</i> than work. As a result of this stress, many men adopt the

[p. <i>73</i>]

Many men are secretly or unconsciously angry and depressed by the
traditional bargain they have made with their wives; having been consigned
to the world of work and primary economic responsibility and thus being
cut off from their families. Having made this bargain, as the "natural"
order of things, they feel trapped and powerless to make changes in their
role. Some experience a great sense of loss. Further, many men agree in
principle with equal parental leave but cannot see themselves taking time
off to care for a child for fear that taking a paternity leave would negatively
affect their careers.


How much has the traditional pattern given way to more equal roles for
men and women? Bell (1982) suggested that more men today give
relationships greater precedence over work. Skovholt and Morgan (1981)
felt that there had been a shift in the conceptualization of roles for men and
women with (1) biological differences in sex being deemphasized and the
(2) work achievement role for women and the personal affiliation role for
men being stressed more. It is still a question as to how far most men in
today's world have actually broadened their lives to make relationships and
personal issues more important. Certainly some men have made these
changes.


The significant problem facing men is adjusting to a different image of
what a man is. Can men learn to live in situations of less control and greater
dependence? It is likely that men fear not only being overshadowed by the
capability of the women they are with but, more important, also losing
status and therefore control of their life situations. The feeling that women
should not support men or be the primary breadwinner is deeply ingrained
in both sexes. Most men feel either guilty or threatened in situations of less
pay or no pay, even when income is no problem. Many men are not able to
handle the "opportunity" of not working—for example, to follow a woman
who goes on paid leave for a year. Basically it is a problem of having less
control. A common response for men in such situations is consciously to
suppress feelings of fear and anger, in order not to appear vulnerable or
nonsupportive. These unacknowledged feelings, however, often surface as
resentment, a kind of backlash that undermines intimacy. Ambiguous
feelings such as these are common in relationships in the midst of change.
Counseling at these times can help unravel these hidden agendas and
conflicts, helping couples to discuss their feelings more honestly and
openly.


<b>Developmental Issues</b>


A number of authors have discussed
career issues from a developmental perspective (Brim, 1976; Bookneck,

[p. <i>74</i>]

These authors have generally emphasized the turmoil and stagnation
that can occur at different stages in men's career development along with
the possibility of renewal and adjustment to a new stage. Possible
alternatives to the more traditional life-work developmental pattern might
involve the integration of work and family responsibilities, as in a dual-
career marriage, part-time employment, or even as house-husband. It
seems true, however, that these alternatives often do not really arise as
conscious possibilities for men until about midlife, a time when many men
seek counseling.


The so-called midlife period, usually occurring around the time when
men approach 40, can be a particularly stressful time. For many men
divorce catapults them into doubt and confusion at midlife. For other men
it may be a forced career change, illness, or the loss of a loved one. By the
time men are fortyish, they have spent a number of years "getting
somewhere" and many are "lost" in their work. By this time, however,
many begin to know, or at least suspect, that wealth, status, fame or power
cannot be a shield from life's realities. Midlife is often a time when men
start to realize that they are vulnerable to age, illness, and death; many have
experienced the death or illness of parents. It can be a time for them to
consider renegotiating the contract, for asking themselves if they want to
continue jeopardizing their health and relationships in exchange for more
money and status. At the heart of this assessment is the issue of self-respect.
Taking the risk at this time of life to confront these existential questions
exposes men to deep feelings of vulnerability. For many it can be easier to
rush back to work and avoid the awkwardness of these strange feelings.
Excessive work may be hard and costly to a degree, but it is familiar and
predictable.


Erikson (1963) described midlife as potentially offering ways of
becoming interpersonally "generative," an opportunity to nurture and
actualize untapped resources in oneself. Unfortunately, in one study,
Farrell and Rosenberg (1981) found only one-third of a broad sample of
normal men at midlife achieved a positive "generative solution" at midlife.


Other problems often compound the difficulties men experience in
attempting to reevaluate their priorities. Very often a man's family depends

[p. <i>75</i>]

Similar conflicts and questions are often raised at the time of retirement.
Most men are not prepared for retirement and its impact on their self-
concept and emotions. Many men have still at this time defined themselves
almost entirely in relation to their work. Self-esteem and control issues can
become particularly acute.


Skovholt and Morgan (1981) discussed a number of retirement issues,
including the importance of physical health, financial security, and positive
interpersonal relationships. They also described at length the problems of
men who have had too much of their self-esteem connected with work.
Others have described the traumas men experience in moving from
significant activity in male-dominated places to inactivity in places
dominated by wives; for most men the workplace has been their place of
control in their adult lives (Skovholt &amp; Hansen, 1980). Again, there are
opportunities for growth and renewal as well as problems facing men at
retirement. Counselors need to encourage men to find these opportunities.
For those men who continue "too long" at any life stage to try and find all of
their meaning through work there is usually a growing sense of emptiness
coupled with a sense that one has never done enough. Those men who
finally discover that work isn't everything have to struggle with the
question of, "Now what?"


<b>Counseling Issues
and Approaches</b>


During this time of rapid changes, an
increasing number of men are experiencing career shifts, unemployment,
midlife issues, retirement, and other identity crises. Some men want to
change their jobs because of boredom or frustration. Corporate people
often want out of the bottom-line-only mentality. Technical people
sometimes want more contact with people. Some men want to change jobs
out of a feeling of being unable to be assertive enough to get what they need
from their present job or they may feel themselves losing out in a
competitive struggle. Lack of status or insufficient income motivates many

[p. <i>76</i>]

Generally, those who make the most successful job switches are
motivated not only to escape a particular job but also by positive attraction
to something else. However, seeking career change can also be an attempt
to avoid dealing with the real problem. The increasing complexity of career
and life decisions, often involving difficult choices and compromises,
means that men will increasingly turn to counselors for help.


Career counseling is often initiated at a time of performance failure.
Male issues may for the first time become relevant as men are faced with
crises and difficult times. A man seeking career counseling might really be
searching for legitimacy for the sides of himself that have been lost (O'Neil,
1981). Some men are looking for outlets for expression of feelings from
conflicts and other stresses on the job.


Traditional career counseling has consisted mainly of discovering
individual traits, analyzing occupational requirements, and matching the
individual to the job (Weinrach, 1979). Increasingly, computer programs
such as the <i>System of Interactive Guidance and Information</i> (1974), better
known as "SIGI," are being developed and used for matching interests and
values to available jobs. A common adjunct to traditional career counseling
has been the teaching of job searching skills, such as interviewing
techniques, application, and resume writing skills.


Although providing accurate information to clients about their interests,
skills, and employment possibilities and helping them to find work are
important, it is not enough. Much of a man's personal identity and sense of
worth is connected to his work; therefore, career counseling must
encompass examining many psychological factors and issues that go
beyond aptitude, intelligence, and interest. An increased awareness and
sensitivity to needs and feelings surrounding work increases the potential
for making sound career choices.


Counseling may sometimes best be focused on enhancing the current
work situation. A man may need greater self-knowledge or greater
acceptance of his fears and other feelings he has while on the job. Osherson
(1986) described how at work a man may unconsciously repeat his own
father-son relationship through mentor-mentee relationships, with all the
same problems and unresolved issues.


Skovholt and Morgan (1981) noted that it is sometimes important to
teach clients how to focus their energy productively. This might involve
teaching new work attitudes, stress or time management skills, or long-
range planning skills. These skills are often best learned in structured
workshops or experience-oriented classroom situations; therefore, it is

[p. <i>77</i>]

Increasingly the industrial sector is recognizing the need for such
training and is offering programs for employees in these areas. Often men
need help in learning how to deal with conflict and cooperation and how to
discriminate between productive conflict and conflict that is excessive or
dysfunctional. For this issue, group training sessions are often more useful
than individual counseling.


Skovholt and Morgan (1981, p. 234), while observing that the work of
the career counselor has been centered primarily on facilitating movement
from powerlessness to power, noted that "facilitating upward mobility and
increased consumption may no longer be totally virtuous work for career
counselors." It is at least important to ask how career counselors can
intervene to help men understand and deal with power and competition
issues, problems of control, and career and family conflicts. How can
counselors help men to clarify their values concerning their roles as
breadwinner, husband, and father?


To begin with, it is important that counselors provide a great deal of
active support for men and encourage them to express their feelings. Open
questioning can help a man define how he sees the masculine role and its
alternatives.


Providing readings may also be helpful. There is an ever growing
number of useful books on men's issues concerning work, which can be
recommended as an adjunct to counseling. Books such as Levinson's <i>The
Seasons of a Man's Life</i> (1978), Sheehy's <i>Passages</i> (1977), and LaBier's
<i>Modern Madness</i> (1986) have helped some men achieve a better sense of
their experiences while going through the emotional turmoil brought about
by major life and occupational changes. Osherson's book <i>Finding our
Fathers</i> (1986) offers a useful understanding of men's feelings about their
work in the context of upbringing and family relationships. Bowles's <i>What
Color Is Your Parachute</i> (1987), which is revised yearly, provides concrete
information about changing careers and applying for jobs.


Of particular importance in career counseling is helping men examine
how gender-role conflicts influence their emotional, physical, and interpersonal
lives. Sometimes men need counseling where deeper feelings may
be explored and encouraged, where other potential sides can be exposed
and developed, and where fears can be confronted. Counseling should
work toward heightened awareness and understanding of feelings, offering
a man expanded choices.


Counselors should encourage men to explore the limitations of the
traditional male role, particularly needs for status and control. Many men
are "workaholics" or are caught up in the seduction of money and power.
Although counselors cannot deny the importance of social status, which is

[p. <i>78</i>]

As women take on traditional male work roles, denying the male-only
association of these patterns, men need help dealing with losses of gender
privilege and with confronting their fears about women moving into jobs
that were once men's exclusive territory. The percentage of males entering
traditional female occupations is smaller. This may be due to economic and
desirability factors, as "women's jobs" traditionally pay less; however,
studies suggest that there is also a larger stigma attached to men who do
"women's work"(Yanico, 1978). Counseling can provide support for men
who are considering or working in nontraditional work roles.


Most men experience gaps between their aspirations and their occupational
realities. Their unhappiness at not "being something" often distracts
them from the reality of what is now. For the unemployed man whose
self-esteem is based primarily on comparative performance, these conflicts
are particularly unbearable.


A typical example is David, who unexpectedly lost his job. He felt a
devastating loss of face, but he was reluctant to acknowledge his major
fear—that of not being able to support his family. As David mostly got
encouragement and understanding from family and friends, he felt his fears
were inexcusable. Although he did not admit to others his loss of self-
confidence, thoughts of failure and self-incrimination gradually took over.
David tried to find another job, but the possibilities were below his
standards for income and prestige; for other positions he lacked the
necessary training or credentials.


Gradually, David removed himself emotionally from family and friends,
and his marriage deteriorated. He drank more and more. He felt no desire
for sexual or other intimate contact with his wife. His wife's ultimatum that
he see a therapist or she would leave finally convinced him to seek
professional help. He was depressed, at times angry, and feeling increasingly
hopeless.


When David began counseling sessions he did not admit that he wanted
help. He continued, however, and gradually began to let go of some of his
pride. As he began to see himself more objectively, he looked at the images
he had carried of what a man should be. He learned that his expectations
had been projected as absolute male standards.


Later David joined a men's group and talked more openly about his
feelings than ever before in his life. He also took a part-time job and went

[p. <i>79</i>]

During this time, David's wife had begun working part-time, which at
first made him anxious and uncertain. By talking with his group, he saw
that his feelings stemmed from his fear of not being dominant in his family.
Recognizing this fear, he gradually became more comfortable with the
situation.


As David prepared himself for a new way of fitting into the work world,
he realized that status had been the largest factor in his first career choice.
Though status is still important to David, he no longer feels that it is
running his life.


<b>Counselor Variables</b>


In addition to effective counseling
skills, counselors need an awareness of how technical and personal skills
and interests relate to the actual world of work. Further, career counselors
working with men must understand how work for men fits into the broader
cultural milieu.


Career counselors also need to have an awareness of their own gender-
role issues, and to understand in particular their own level of commitment
to the status quo. Even counselors' subtle adherence to traditional
masculine and feminine stereotypes can be restricting. Men exploring
career questions or nontraditional lifestyles deserve a counselor who is
accepting of nontraditional ways of thinking about work, marriage, and
family life. Such a counselor will be able to support men effectively in
dealing with their changing roles and facilitate more innovative solutions.


For males in our society, work is still primary; all other roles are
secondary. This is certainly also true for most professional counselors. It is
not uncommon to encounter male counselors who, while espousing
feminist values, either deny, overlook, or are unconscious of their own
male issues. Many counselors, even those with nontraditional values, still
live more or less traditional lifestyles, and they often carry some
combination of these factors or influences into their counseling work. Male
counselors often fear feminism and in particular feminist therapists who
make claims that women clients should see a woman (Dubois, 1978). This is
partly a male economic and status issue, in which the breadwinner-
provider role is threatened.

[p. <i>80</i>]

A number of authors who discuss traditional and nontraditional
occupations have noted that it is often easier for counselors to support a
female client in espousing values seen as traditionally male than to support
a male client living in accord with values seen as traditionally reserved for
women (Berger &amp; Wright, 1978; Skovholt &amp; Morgan, 1981). It has been
shown (Broverman, Broverman, Clarkson, Rosencrantz, &amp; Vogel, 1970)
that many counselors—male and female—tend to share traditional male
success values both privately and professionally; therefore, they are more
able to support women in new roles because they are aspiring to male goals
and attributes. Now counselors are confronted with male clients who are
affected by these societal changes. Counselors can help men by supporting
nontraditional/"deviant" roles that their clients are considering or have
chosen. Support will come primarily from counselors who have examined
their own value systems and who can support nontraditional behavior.


Another variable to consider here is the openness of the counselor and
the use of self-disclosure. In working with men concerning career issues, it
is often appropriate and useful for counselors to share some of their own
discomforts that parallel the client's presenting problems or struggles.
Particularly coming from male counselors, such disclosure can help by
giving permission and by modeling the expression of emotions. It can also
promote a feeling of acceptance and collaboration. In addition, a
therapists's self-disclosure usually helps a client to open up or admit to
deeper fears and anxieties since he sees that others have the same fears or
concerns. Sharing concerns may also be a way of modeling a willingness to
explore and take risks while attempting to grow and understand one's own
life more fully. Here again, a counselor's unexamined life can serve as a role
model of avoidance.


Another counselor variable of prime importance has to do with social
class differences. Most men and women in the helping professions were
raised in the middle class and are largely ignorant of the problems facing
working-class men. It is undoubtedly difficult for some counselors to
understand being consigned to low status and feeling trapped with few
choices. Therefore, it is especially important for counselors to have respect
for and to try to understand men with problems of economic and class
insecurity. Although it is not possible within the limited scope of this
chapter to deal with the impact of such issues as race and sexual orientation
on career choices and problems, it is important to acknowledge and draw
attention to their importance in career counseling.
