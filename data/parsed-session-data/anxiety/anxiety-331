Until recently, there has been little
need for a <i>Handbook of Mental
Health in the Workplace</i>. Two
factors accounted for this: lack of awareness
of the extent of mental disorders by those
who design and manage organizations,
and the ease of eliminating the problem by
eliminating the affected employee. In this
chapter, we present sufficient data to show
that mental illness
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_844');">[note]</a><div id="_note_844" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. We use the term <i>mental illness</i> with some reluctance, but it is the phrase
used in the most current literature (e.g., Gabriel &amp; Liimatainen, 2001).</div>
is pervasive in American
society as well as in economically advanced
societies in general. We also argue that
organizations will find it in their own interests,
as well as the employee's, to attempt to
accommodate the needs of an individual
experiencing mental distress. Our third goal
in this introduction is to outline briefly
how mental health issues intersect with
organizational practices. No attempt is
made to be comprehensive in reviewing the
literature to meet this third goal. The other
chapters in this book, some of which we cite
in this chapter, accomplish that. The intent
is to present the issues sufficiently to demonstrate
that mental health and organizational
theory and practice are, indeed, bedfellows,
and have been for a long time.


The stigma attached to mental illness
was sufficient to cause most people to keep
personal or family distress hidden whenever
possible. One result of keeping mental
health issues in the closet was the perception
that such problems were rare, and hence of
no concern to anyone except those who

Mental disorders are, in fact, extremely
common. Epidemiological studies cited in
Milazzo-Sayre, Henderson, and Manderscheid
(1997) indicate that within the United
States, in a 1-year period, approximately
28% of the adult population has a mental
or addictive disorder. These authors cite
other evidence that indicates that nearly 3%
of the adult U.S. population suffers from a
"severe" mental disorder during a 1-year
period. The National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) provides data on its Web
site that give an idea of the numbers of
Americans with various types of mental
disorders. Selected figures are presented in
Table 1.1. Comorbidity--the joint appearance
of two or more disorders--complicates
the picture somewhat, but the total still adds
up to a great many people. These numbers
represent only adults, who may have jobs.
There are also millions of children with
mental disorders whose parents may well
be employees, probably distracted ones.
Finally, the prevalence of mental disorders is
sufficient to gain the attention of the
Surgeon General of the United States, who
commissioned a major report issued in 1999
(Satcher, 1999). This report concluded that
all Americans are affected either directly or
indirectly by mental illness, through family,
coworkers, friends, or neighbors. With all of
this information, it is impossible to escape
the conclusion that mental health concerns
can, and probably do, appear in almost any
workplace in the country.


The second factor why a handbook on
mental health in the workplace is needed can
be traced to the needs and responsibilities of
employers. It is now clear that mental health
issues are in the workplace, but these issues
affect the way organizations are managed
and even the profitability of enterprises.
Recently, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> acknowledged
this impact by devoting most of the
cover page of its Marketplace section to this
topic. The lead article begins as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
In a typical office of 20 people, chances are
that four will suffer from a mental illness
this year. Depression, one of the most
common, primarily hits workers in their
most productive years: the 20s through
40s. Its annual toll on U.S. businesses
amounts to about $70 billion in medical
expenditures, lost productivity and other
costs. (Tanouye, 2001, p. B1)
</p>
</blockquote>
Gabriel (2001) gives a somewhat more conservative
estimate of the cost of depression
to U.S. employers: between $30 billion and
$44 billion. These totals consist of direct
treatment costs, costs associated with
absenteeism, lost productivity, and mortality
costs due to suicide. Such costs will also
occur for other mental disorders, although
the weighting may change as a function of
the type and severity of disorder.

Gabriel (2001) also cites interesting
figures from First Chicago Corporation,
which indicate that, out of 10 common
medical afflictions, mental illness is second
only to ischemic heart disease in total cost.
Cancer is a near third. Outpatient treatment
costs are comparable for all three, and both

[p. <i>5</i>]

In the past, because mental illness
was so costly, as long as sufferers were stigmatized,
employers could deal with the
problem easily by terminating the affected
employee. Since enactment of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, it
has been illegal to fire an employee solely
because of a disability. "Reasonable accommodation"
must be made to allow most
people with disabilities to continue working,
if at all possible. Many other countries have
similar or more stringent laws (Gabriel &amp;
Liimatainen, 2001), so the need to work
with mentally disabled employees does not
end at the U.S. border.


Even if there were no legal impediments,
termination has not been easy and is
often costly (Miner &amp; Brewer, 1976). Labor
agreements, while allowing for termination
in cases of egregious behavior, often afford
an employee with protection, so that termination
can be a drawn-out and expensive
affair. Unless the employee has managed to
alienate his or her coworkers, there are also
problems of morale and perceived injustice.
These may have significant, albeit hidden,
costs that many employers would just as
soon avoid. There is also the issue of fairness.
We do not terminate an employee who
has suffered a heart attack or cancer. A
broken leg, not covered by ADA, may still
be looked upon with some patience by an
employer, although with some disappointment.
Why, then, terminate an employee
who is suffering a bout with depression or
anxiety? Indeed, an employee with a broken
leg from a skiing accident may be out of
action longer than many with major depression.
Finally, a employer may have a lot
invested in an employee, an investment that
is not easily abandoned. So, there are a

<b>Organizational Practice and Mental Health</b>

Elton Mayo (cited in Gellerman, 1963), Chris
Argyris (1957), Douglas McGregor (1960,
1966), and other mid-20th-century writers
pointed out that organizational practices may
affect mental health. Mayo's work inspired
an extensive, but curious, form of industrial
counseling, similar in some respects to
Rogerian nondirective counseling, but
oriented toward work (Highhouse, 1999).
Although there was some anecdotal evidence
of the method's effectiveness, it eventually
lost favor due to an inability to show a positive
impact on employees or the bottom line.
In the Argyris formulation, a worker's adaptation
to rigid hierarchy, autocratic managextation
and an unenriched job was itself an
indication of retarded emotional development.
The nature of the job could prevent the
worker from attaining full mental health.
McGregor, writing more or less contemporaneously
with Argyris, believed that organizations
were designed based on assumptions
about the workers. His Theory X
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10037');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10037" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2. Although McGregor's nomenclature of Theory X and Theory Y implies a
sort of algebraic objectivity, we believe that there was a clear message to the reader
of the day. In the 1940s (at least) through the early 1960s, a common advertising
ploy was to compare the name brand against "Brand X." Brand X was always
decidedly inferior in results. It would be difficult for a reader in 1960 to not get the
connection between "Theory X" and "Brand X."</div>
consisted
of management assumptions that had three
basic assumptions but included several
inexplicit beliefs, such as the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. The average man is by nature indolent--
he works as little as possible.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. He lacks ambition, dislikes responsibility,
prefers to be led.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. He is inherently self-centered, indifferent
to organizational needs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. He is by nature resistant to change.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. He is gullible, not very bright, the ready
dupe of the charlatan and the demagogue.
(McGregor, 1966, p. 6; items renumbered
from original)
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. The average man is by nature indolent--
he works as little as possible.


2. He lacks ambition, dislikes responsibility,
prefers to be led.


3. He is inherently self-centered, indifferent
to organizational needs.


4. He is by nature resistant to change.


5. He is gullible, not very bright, the ready
dupe of the charlatan and the demagogue.
(McGregor, 1966, p. 6; items renumbered
from original)


Theory Y, in contrast, was based on the
opposite assumptions of human nature. Of
note is the Theory Y assumption that "people
are not by nature passive or resistant to organizational
needs. <i>They have become so as a
result of experience in organizations</i> [italics
added]" (McGregor, 1966, p. 15). Thus, if
Theory X paints a picture of a man or
woman who lacks full mental health, Theory
Y holds that it is the organization for whom
he or she works that is responsible. Today,
we would question this last premise, realizing
that to some extent, employees bring
their mental disorders with them to work or
develop them coincident to employment.
Meaningful work is regarded as therapeutic
by some psychologists, as described in some
later chapters, but it seems doubtful that
work alone is generally an effective therapy.


We present these classic theories in some
detail because they form the foundation for
the primary organizational and motivational
theories up to the present. On the intellectual
side, virtually everyone hopes for a
world in which Theory Y is true, but our
behavior often reveals little faith in that
occurring. To illustrate, one of the unspoken
worries about the ADA was that it would
encourage malingering, the ultimate Theory
X behavior. Claims of disability are often
met with skepticism by management and
coworkers. No one disputes that disability
claims should be investigated and substantiated,
but we maintain that this book will
help lead to informed skepticism rather than

[p. <i>7</i>]

The universal rejection of Theory X by
organizational theorists opened the door for
current conceptualizations of flat hierarchies;
self-managed, team-based organizations; and
expectations that employees make decisions
with the organization's interests at heart. All
of these concepts require an assumption that
employees either can or can be easily taught
to communicate openly, face situations
honestly, work together with others, recognize
others' priorities and adapt to them, shift priorities
or tasks quickly and easily, and make
and carry out decisions that may be contrary
to their own interests (Cannon-Bowers,
Tannenbaum, Salas, &amp; Volpe, 1995; Wellins,
Byham, &amp; Wilson, 1991). People who are
depressed, anxious, or overly stressed may
have difficulty carrying out required behaviors
to meet these assumptions. Individuals
with personality disorders or psychotic conditions
may not be able to gain or use such
skills, except in extraordinary circumstances.
Thus, the ultimate success of current theories
of organization may depend upon the prevalence
of clinical or even subclinical mental
disorders in the workforce. To our knowledge,
few, if any, studies have examined the
robustness of these management theories to
violations of the assumptions of a mentally
healthy workforce.

<b>The Impact of the Workplace on Mental Health</b>

The workplace itself may contribute to distress
and, ultimately, to mental disorders.
This notion dates to at least the 1930s, with
studies examining the presence of inhalable
toxic chemicals and employee emotionality
(cf. Tiffin, 1942). As we described earlier,
the effect of the social organization was
fundamental to Argyris's (1957) work and
implicit in McGregor's (1960, 1966) writing.
Today, descendants of these ideas have been
validated by considerable research on the
impact of stress on the worker and the work
(see Sutherland and Cooper, Chapter 3, and
Smith, Sulsky, and Uggerslev, Chapter 4).
Too much work, poorly defined responsibilities,
an unsupportive boss, a lack of control,
and many other factors can constitute stressors
that, in turn, under the right (or perhaps
we should say wrong) conditions, can create
sufficient strain such that a person becomes
physically or mentally ill.


Unfortunately, stress appears to be additive
because the key is the total stress under
which one operates. Stressors need not be
confined to one area of life. Stress from a
person's non-work life can combine with
work stress to create problems. Making
matters worse, different aspects of life can
interact to create even more stress. Work-family
conflict is the classic example of this
and the cause of much distress across the
workforce. Hammer, Colton, Caubet, and
Brockwood (Chapter 5) show how work and
family life conflict can wreak havoc in one's
life, and Beehr and O'Driscoll (Chapter 6)
describe how organizational stress and workfamily
conflict can be reduced.


Current organizational theories differ
from those of the mid-20th century in two
important ways. First, the assumed motivational
foundation for employees has shifted
from needs-based theories to a complex
mix of environmental, social, cognitive, learning,
emotional, and personality factors.
This wider vista of motivational forces
eventually will lead to an even fuller understanding
of behavior in the workplace by
allowing a stronger connection between
organizational and clinical perspectives.
Newly developing organizational and clinical
theories of motivation are beginning to
parallel one another in unexpected ways.
As one example, Nolen-Hoeksema (1993)

[p. <i>8</i>]

Compare Nolen-Hoeksema's (1993)
theory to a theory of motivation that is
beginning to attract attention within I/O
psychology: Kuhl's Action-State Theory
(cited in Hall, Schlauch, &amp; Chang, 2001)
and its attendant Action-State Orientation.
In this theory, when people encounter an
anxiety-provoking situation, they adopt a
state orientation, characterized by thoughts
of failure, and exhibit difficulty in taking
useful actions. People with an action orientation,
in the same situation, may express
anxiety about failure, but they use effective
coping responses to plan and execute
behaviors. Hall et al. (2001) utilize this theory
in an interesting attempt to explain the
effects of autonomy on job satisfaction and
performance. There appears to be little
difference between a rumination strategy and
a state orientation or between a distraction
strategy and an action orientation. Additional
research testing for both of these
theories is needed before they can become
fully established, but we anticipate that they
will prove to be useful additions to our store
of knowledge. A useful rule of thumb is
that when two different fields of endeavor
independently develop very similar propositions,
it is likely that these propositions will
prove to be important and general.


A second important difference between
mid-20th-century organizational theories
and current ones lies in the motivation for
choosing the preferred organization design.
Lawler (1991) traced this development from
the Human Relations school, in which
participation was valued because it would
result in greater employee satisfaction and
commitment; to the Human Resource
approach, in which an investment in people
pays off because they are more valuable;
and to the High Involvement Organization
ideal, in which having a hand in decision
making in the management of their work
by even the lowest level employees makes
for greater organizational effectiveness.
The impetus for such effectiveness comes
from the necessity of adapting to forces in
the outside world: changing competition,
technology, consumer preferences, and other
environmental influences (Galbraith &amp;
Kazanjian, 1988; Mohrman, 1993). Being
driven by the environment requires a broad
perceptual focus, openness, and the ability
to make realistic appraisals of opportunities
and threats. It also requires the ability
to translate these appraisals into changed
goals and priorities and the skill to communicate
this to others. Most people would
find working in such an environment arousing.
It is well established that arousal and
performance are related to each other
according to an inverted U function

<b><i>The Need for Integration of Knowledge
Between Clinical and I/O Psychology
and Human Resources</i></b>


For many years, clinical/counseling
psychologists have gone one way, and I/O
psychologists and their colleagues in human
resources have gone another. Tiffin's (1942)
textbook on industrial psychology included
explicit attention to emotional factors and, in
the context of personality testing, explained
the major mental disorders as they were
conceived at the time. Sometime after Tiffin's
text, such matters largely disappeared from
I/O psychology. Such research as was conducted
through 1970 was reviewed by Miner
and Brewer (1976) in the first edition of
Dunnette's (1976) <i>Handbook of Industrial
and Organizational Psychology</i>. In their
chapter on the management of ineffective
performance, "stress, emotion, and emotional
disturbance" comprised 2 out of 34 pages,
whereas alcoholism and drug addiction
together took up three pages.


Levinson's (1983) work at the Division
of Industrial Mental Health at the Menninger
Foundation from 1956 to 1970 was an
exception to the general separation of
clinical and I/O psychology. At that time,
he worked primarily on the "three A's--
absenteeism, alcoholism, and accidents"
(Levinson, 1983, p. 8). Levinson has continued
to exert an influence on the field of
organizational theory, although his psychoanalytic
framework has left him somewhat
outside the mainstream of I/O psychology.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_22832');">[note]</a><div id="_note_22832" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">3. A brief review of the psychodynamic view of organizational behavior,
inspired largely by Levinson, is provided by Cilliers and Koortzen (2000).</div>


As mentioned previously, early counseling
programs in industry faded away by
the late 1950s or early 1960s (Highhouse,
1999). There remained a need for the counseling
of employees with emotional or
mental health problems, a niche eventually
filled by Employee Assistance Programs
(EAPs). These programs began as a means of
providing employees with many types of
assistance, including financial advice and
planning, but have expanded their services to
include providing mental health and some
wellness services. As such, EAPs are primarily
the reserve of clinical/counseling psychologists,
counselors, and social workers. They
have developed largely independently of I/O
psychology but are integrated with human
resources, because that is the department
that usually selects and hires the EAP
provider. By the mid-1970s, work in EAPs
had evolved to the point where Manuso
(1983) coined the term <i>occupational clinical
psychology</i>. The scope of EAP service delivery
has expanded to the point that many provide
organizational services (Cagney, 1999),
which may be indistinguishable in name
from those offered by I/O psychologists (see
Ginsberg, Kilburg, &amp; Gomes, 1999, for an
example). Although I/O psychologists often
complain among themselves about this development
and the loss of "their" market, a
reversal of this trend does not seem likely in
the foreseeable future. Joining together scientists
and practitioners from the clinical, I/O,
and human resource disciplines will further

[p. <i>10</i>]

By the second edition of Dunnette's
<i>Handbook</i> in the early 1990s (Dunnette &amp;
Hough, 1992), which had grown to four
large volumes, a chapter appeared detailing
how to utilize counseling techniques in the
development of employees and to achieve
behavior change in general (Hellervik,
Hazucha, &amp; Schneider, 1992). Lowman
(1993, 1996) has presented an integration of
clinical and I/O psychology in his work on
dysfunctional employees. Similarly, symposia
and posters have appeared at Society for
Industrial and Organizational Psychology
(SIOP) conferences concerned with alcohol
and drug use, emotional behavior, use of
EAPs, and other clinically related topics.
Recently, one of us (JCT) attended a preconference
workshop at the SIOP conference on
executive coaching. The issue that brought
the greatest discussion among participants
was how to differentiate between a client
who was "odd" or "eccentric" and one who
had a mental disorder that required clinical
skills to treat and that lay outside the scope
of coaching. The workshop participants
understood the high probability that an executive
coach with a large clientele would run
into this situation eventually. They also recognized
the need for gaining information
that may be useful in such circumstances.
Thus, we see a press for greater integration
of I/O and clinical psychology from the perspectives
of research and practice.


Clinicians and counselors work with
clients on workplace issues. Under ADA, they
may make recommendations as to fitness for
duty, limitations on work, and even the types
of accommodations that may be necessary. It
is difficult to see how this is done properly
without a basic working knowledge of work
and the workplace, but it is being done.
Conti and Burton's (1999) description of
how to manage behavior health disability
makes it clear that this knowledge is essential
in creating workable solutions. In addition to
ADA issues, the workplace poses various risk
factors for mental health, many of which
would seem to be logical targets for therapy.
Kasl (1992) listed 10 dimensions of the work
setting that he considered to be at least
provisionally affecting worker psychological
health. These included interpersonal factors,
such as coworkers and leaders; work content;
organizational and structural aspects; and
community and social aspects, such as prestige
and status of occupation. A clinician who
knows how organizations operate, the roles
of leaders, the impact of organizational culture
and climate, the impact of discrimination
and harassment, and other features of the
workplace will be better placed to assist
clients in decision making, recognizing cognitive
or behavioral traps, and otherwise making
helpful changes.


As scientists and practitioners in the field
of human behavior, we need to know more
about the borders of normal behavior, if for
no other reason than to better understand
everyday life. That is as true in the work
setting as in the rest of life. Herbert Simon
(1969) wrote that we gain our greatest
understanding of systems when they break
down. We know a good deal about how the
average person responds in a large number of
organizational situations, but relatively little
about how people at the extremes of personality,
cognitive capacity, and emotionality
respond. There is a shortage of research on
the workplace and mental health. An exception
lies in the area of counterproductive
work behaviors, most notably anger, hostility,
and violence. McNulty, Bordeaux, and Hogan
(Chapter 20) review this area, whereas
Svyantek and Brown (Chapter 24) examine
the interaction of these behaviors and organizational
climate and culture. Binning and

[p. <i>11</i>]

Enough is known about mental health
in the workplace to fill a large book, but we
would be the first to admit that what we
know is insufficient. Although some interest
in the topic goes back many years, it is
only because of legal and social changes of
the past 10 or 15 years that we have created
the conditions where such a book is
possible. Much more research is needed.
Although we have made the case that mental
disorders are common in the workplace,
the base rate for a particular disorder in a
particular workplace is likely to be too low
for commonly employed research technologies.
Generating the knowledge we will
need for future developments may require
the development of new research techniques
amenable for use with small samples, such
as randomization or permutation tests
(Edgington, 1995; Ludbrook &amp; Dudley,
1998). It may also require greater acceptance
of some existing, but underused,
techniques. Babiak's (1995) case study of
an industrial psychopath is an excellent
example of the latter. His detailing of that
psychopath's mode of operation provides a
rich source of potential further research
ideas and also gives direction for the practitioner
faced with such a person in a client
organization. As new research accumulates,
we expect organizational, human resource,
and clinical practice to evolve along with it.
Integration of I/O and clinical psychology,
human resources, and other disciplines in
the study, prevention, and treatment of
mental health issues in the workplace is an
exciting development that should pay
dividends for many years.
