ELIZABETH


This account was written at my request by a 32-year-old
married woman, one week following a six-week hospital
stay. She apparently agreed to write the account to
"have the whole experience behind me," and in that
frame of mind she presented it to me. The immediate
events leading up to hospitalization are alluded to in the
document. Elizabeth was a very sensitive, though nonassertive,
woman who was experiencing increasing conflict
in her marriage of eight years. Her own father was
an extremely critical and demeaning man whose influence
Elizabeth had hoped to escape by her marriage. Her
husband, she increasingly perceived, was not the capable,
protecting man she had hoped but was quite insecure
and in need of support himself. His responses to her
inadequacies were frequently thoughtless and abusive.
He suggested, for instance, that she "go have some affairs"
so that she could be a more satisfying sexual partner
for him. She was, however, bound to the relationship
by the same lack of confidence which made her relatively
ineffective in it. In the context of this conflict she became
psychotic, and she wrote the following document as a
description of the onset of that experience:

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It began at the first session of Mrs. Morris' class
on the disciplining of children. My husband and I
went together, and there were four other couples.


Earlier in the fall I had told Mrs. Morris about my
marital problems and how worried I was because of
what it might be doing to my children. As she
talked, I began to think she had consulted other
people about my husband and myself, even my parents
and neighbors, and was using facts from my
life to illustrate discipline situations. I was very
happy that she had decided to help me, as it seemed
to me. From things Mrs. Morris said, I believed she
had consulted Dr. Wilson, the pediatrician. I
thought of Dr. Wilson as the kind of man I would
liked to have had as a father. I thought that he
would be present at a social gathering scheduled for
the Sunday after Valentine's Day, though I had no
real reason to suspect this. Mrs. Morris commented
how important to a child's security and peace of
mind was the care for his physical needs. I thought I
had paid too much attention to my children's emotional
needs forgetting the importance of their
physical welfare. I thought Sandra might have a
heart condition because I had pushed her too much.
I thought both of the children might become deaf
due to my failure to take them to the doctor in time.
I felt guilty about smoking when I was pregnant
with Ellen and when I nursed her. I thought that
smoking was injuring my own health; sometimes I
tried to stop, other times I wished I were dead, and
smoked even the dirty cigarette butts lying around.


I believed that I was an "emotionally disturbed"
person; I believed my husband was something or
other, but I didn't know what except that it scared
me to think he might break down and "do something."

<i>Thursday through Tuesday</i>


Thoughts spun around in my head and everything,
objects, sounds, events, etc., took on special
meanings for me. Childhood feelings began to
come back, as symbols and bits from past conversations
went through my head: I felt like I was putting
the pieces of a puzzle together. I thought understanding
myself better would help me with conflicts
that I felt compelled to resolve; I wanted to
grow up and feel the way a 33-year old woman was
supposed to. I had the feeling of losing everything. I
related this feeling with what Mrs. Morris had said
about toilet training. I remembered as a child I had
been constipated, and recalled vividly one time
when I was given an enema. I related this sensation
of losing everything with going to the bathroom. I
couldn't find anything, like shoes, socks, etc. This
problem got more acute as the week went along. I
shed clothing, and tried to wear the appropriate
clothing befitting my age and my role. I thought I
had to wear the appropriate costume in order to behave
appropriately.


Mrs. Morris had remarked how easily a child can
adopt a role in play: just a hat is enough to make a
child feel that part. She also mentioned how children
love to wear sneakers. I thought she was talking
about my own childhood situation when she
told us the story of a very creative child who had
charmed her parents out of her share of attention—
that I was so "creative" that I could play any role
almost to the point of convincing myself of the reality

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After that, I felt it a dire emergency to run to the
store and buy boots and shoes appropriate to my
role as housewife and mother. I shed my winter coat
and substituted an old mouton Smith College coat,
I threw away my black stockings, because they were
old lady's stockings. I noticed sometimes I even
walked like an old lady. My father had explained to
me how my grandmother had died when he visited
at Christmastime. Although I could remember
nothing about her, I thought I had mimicked her
and played grandmother as a child.


Mrs. Morris mentioned how disturbing it was to a
child to have toys taken away or thrown away before
the child was old enough to understand the reason
for it. I felt she was referring to my family's
move from Connecticut to New York when I was
four and a half. A lot of my toys I never saw again. I

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As this feeling became more desperate I made
myself go through certain "rituals": such as the discarding
of clothing (I even threw away my husband's
western boots, meaning to tell him we'd better
stop playing cowboy). I felt as if I might be becoming
dangerous to my children. So a voice in my
head kept saying, "You must protect the children."
I put all "phallic symbols," knives, knitting needles,
etc., in a suitcase. I put the suitcase in the garbage.
I began to lose more control over myself,

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remembered telling a friend that if everything
could be turned inside out, that if everyone helped
me and took my side, so that I wouldn't have any
fear of being ostracized, then I could do anything I
aspired to do. I also believed anyone could will
themselves to be their own image of greatness. I
thought this was what was happening. I thought
something I heard on the radio was a message for
me; that <i>Time Magazine</i> had an article written for
me. Everything got increasingly symbolic. I began
sleeping only two hours a night, seeing movies in
my head till I fell asleep. For some reason I didn't
feel exhausted during the day.


Cigarettes became phallic symbols. I kept lighting
them and throwing them in the toilet. When I
felt good I noticed I didn't smoke; I forgot them.
The <i>Time Magazine</i> article was about present-day
sex and morals. It said that a certain group was trying
to discover the difference between good orgasm
and bad orgasm, that one made a person feel good,
and the other made a person feel bad. "Aha!" I said
to myself. "Could it be that...?" Since our marriage
seemed to sink or swim on the basis of our
sexual relations, the article was very pertinent. Often

<i>Wednesday</i>


We took a walk, my children, the dog, and I. I
began to worry about my ability to take care of my
children; but the voice kept saying, "You must protect
the children." So I willed myself to be very, very
careful. I held their hands firmly while walking
along the road. But a car stopped as we were waiting
to cross the road; the woman said to me, "So
that's the dog that almost killed my dog. I see you
have him on the leash now." I thought, "Oh, fooey!"
and my left hand let go of Ellen just as a car
coming the other way tried to squeeze between us
and the car that had stopped. Instead, I said, "Yes,
you don't have to worry; we walk him now." I was
alarmed that I had let go of Ellen, and thought I
was being tested as to whether I was a good mother

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had made another appointment with Mrs. Morris
for 1:30 or so in the afternoon. I had planned to
talk with her about what was going on. But I
changed my mind and went instead to introduce her
to Sandra whom she hadn't met, and to show her a
good drawing I had made. I was very happy because
I felt like myself. I felt I had to go through the day
until the meeting at Mrs. Morris', and then I'd be
able to function as a girl, as me, Elizabeth.


After leaving Mrs. Morris we drove around, my
head getting more and more mixed up. I had told
Sandra we would go to the Stamford Museum. As
we went along the parkway, the sun shone on the
windshield and blinded me so that I had to pull
over to the side of the road to clean the windshield. I
got out of the car and saw the cars coming at me
very fast. I saw the real danger and felt it was like a
new experience for me. I thought I was being
shown the real things to fear in place of the old general
panic and feeling of inadequacy. Now I would
see a symbol and there would be a "boing" in my
mind, and I'd remember something and its significance
in my life. I drove the car as if I were a child
driving for the first time. I got to the Stamford Museum
about 5:00. We ran around looking at the animals.
I had a thought of how it would be to be an
elephant in a cage; and then I was distressed, and as
we went out I yelled at the sky "I'm not an elephant.
I'm Elizabeth." (When I gave birth to Ellen I described
to my husband that I trumpeted like an elephant.)

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was another voice now saying to me: "Go
towards what makes you feel good." We drove to
the supermarket. The car parked next to ours had
an elderly man sitting in it. He looked like a priest
dressed in red and white. "Boing," it reminded me
of my grandmother's funeral. In the supermarket—
boing—I looked in my messy purse, and thought
how like an old lady's purse. I began to feel that we
were all schizophrenics; me, my husband, Sandra,
and Ellen, my mother and father. At the supermarket
I got the makings for spaghetti. Later, eating it,
it reminded me of blood and flesh—boing—and my
husband who liked it was then under suspicion. I
thought he might have murdered someone, and
many more morbid thoughts of this kind. I began to
be afraid I would get out of control and kill my
children and myself or that my husband would. Returning
to the house I could hardly do anything. I
couldn't find things, I couldn't concentrate on anything
I tried to do. I walked aimlessly around the
house. Somehow I fed the children and dressed for

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The babysitter came and I drove to pick up my
husband. All the good feeling left me when he got
in the car. When we arrived at the meeting I could
neither talk nor listen to what was said; I was as uncomfortable
as I used to be. I felt Mrs. Morris was
trying to draw me out, but I felt very uncomfortable.


Returning home, I felt very defeated and very desperate.
I asked my husband to make love to me even
though I had my period. He did. We were both disappointed.
Later, I imagined he had used a knife. I
felt like a whore. I smelled cigar smoke coming
from downstairs. This was my husband's first cigar
since we got married. I thought this unusual and
began to get scared of him. I realized that he wasn't
part of the plot. But I thought someone had given
him the cigar as a kind of pacifier. I thought he
might be cracking up. We stayed up all night long
talking. I thought he might have done something
really awful. I grew terrified of him. I thought he
would kill me if he lost control of himself. I
thought there were people watching the house, and
that they would intervene if something awful happened.
I began to tremble, shiver, my heart
pounded. I paced back and forth. I thought that
something my brother did when we were little
scared me a great deal, but being loyal I couldn't tell
on him. I thought I had the same relationship with
my husband, that he was bad, and I couldn't tell on
him. I was afraid my husband would never call the
doctor even if I were dying. I suggested once that I
was having a heart attack, and that maybe we
should call the doctor. Finally, he did.

<i>Comment</i>


The timing of this psychotic illness is related to Elizabeth's
perception that her marriage is in serious difficulty.
She has endured years of abuse and disrespect which
she has been unable to question; moreover she blames
herself for her husband's erratic, uncaring behavior. Intimidated
throughout her early years by her own father,
she has been unable to manage that degree of healthy
self-assertion as an adult which would have been required
for the maintenance of her marriage. Her guilt
and lack of competence in her role as wife and mother
paralyze her, as does her fear that her husband will abandon
her. This impasse ushers in a psychotic illness.


This document is a particularly illustrative example
of the interaction between form and content during an
acute psychotic state. The aura of hopeful yet fearful expectancy
pervades the account. All perceptual processes
are at the command of and in the service of the desire to

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another aspect of the altered state in psychosis which
is illustrated by this document is the hypermnesis with
regard to the events of childhood.
<blockquote>
<p>
Childhood feelings began to come back as
symbols and bits from past conversations went
through my head ... I began to think I was
hypnotized so that I would remember what
had happened in the first four and a half years
of my life ... I thought that my parents had
supplied information about the nursery school
teacher and pediatrician to someone—perhaps
my husband—with the hope that I would be
able to straighten myself out by remembering
the early years.

This aspect of the psychotic state has not been sufficiently
emphasized. As we have noted, the ideational flood in
acute psychosis comes both from the external perceptual

This account further illustrates the intrusion of ideation
concerning growth strivings and identity formation
which we have previously noted in other documents.


I felt like I was putting the pieces of a puzzle
together. I thought understanding myself better
would help me with conflicts that I felt
compelled to resolve; I wanted to grow up and
feel the way a 33-year old woman was supposed
to ... I felt as if I were love and hate with
nothing in the middle, that everything was opposites,
but that I was fighting myself so that
the little girl of four and a half would grow up
quickly and so that I could be a woman and a
good mother to my children.


Such expressions of conflict and desire for personal
change are a common but not invariable aspect of conscious
experience during certain psychotic states. We
have previously suggested that this experience of conflict
may have prognostic significance. At the very least its
presence makes possible a more rapid achievement of a
working consensus between patient and therapist.


The content of the psychotic ideation described by this
individual centers around the recollection of myriad
events and conflicts experienced during her own developmental
years.

JOAN


This record is included because it illustrates the subjective
phenomenology of an experience found in a
number of psychotic states; namely, conflict over the expression
of anger. The patient, Joan, is a mother in her
mid-thirties who became acutely psychotic in the midst
of marital difficulty. She was the product of a very disturbed
family in which her father, an alcoholic, was
prone to violent rages and abusive treatment of his children
when he was intoxicated. When sober, he was a passive
recipient of denigration and sarcasm at the hands of
his wife. Joan learned both to fear and to feel sorry for
her father. He was, in her eyes, either terribly threatening
or painfully weak. Joan grew up having learned to
shrink from the aggression of others and to disown such
feelings when they arose within her. In her second marriage,

Dear Doctor:


Well, my universe is broadening. It seems that
through this neurosis or whatever it is, I am seeking
to re-think my whole status of assumptions—that's
the phrase that comes to mind. Today my husband
visited and it was a long re-thinking process. I
talked about early dating patterns, my lack of
homosexual experience yet sympathy for the homosexual.
There are lots of answers I don't have, but I
am rushing myself too fast I think. My stomach's
always anxious and I am in a constant state of apprehension.
I wish I could just let myself slow
down. Why am I in such a damn hurry. Please tell
me why I am in such a damn fucking hurry to do
this thing. It's like fighting to save your consciousness,
back-peddling with yourself like sudden vollies
shut off ("shut" for "shot"—I must keep my
mouth "shut" says association) about my real lack
of intention about giving any of my neurosis up for
anything—even normality. Why do I want to hurt
my husband? So he will reject me? I answer, OK,
now I say can I get some sleep? I still need very
much to be slowed down and to hear why everything
is so fast...We (my husband and I) talked
yesterday of my being a secret bourgeoise, of wanting
the ring and affidavits of legalized courtship. We

<i>Comment</i>


In the setting of a hostile, unpredictable, and unstable
family of origin, this woman learned substantially to
doubt her own worth and developed a strategy of avoidance
in the face of exploitation by others. In marriage to a
talented but controlling man, success would have required
that she confidently assert and pursue her own
style and interests. She was unable to oppose him in any
useful way, however, fearing both her own assertiveness
and the hostility which opposition provoked in her husband.
In time her evasion led to activities (excessive
spending, an affair) which only intensified her feelings
of worthlessness. Caught in the impasse created by her
wish for self-respect and individuality in the marriage
versus her fear of the internal and external hostility that
pursuing such goals would require, she developed an
acute psychosis.


The psychotic state itself is characterized in this instance
by intense anxiety, rapidity of ideational processes,
and intrusive thoughts that she might harm herself
or her family. The patient apparently felt that somehow
in the plethora of ideas, memories, and connected
thoughts lay the "key" or "answer." She was supported
in this notion by her husband, a man who enjoyed
"playing with" ideas, fantasies, and "associations," and
who did not want to acknowledge the real desperation of
his wife. Her method of dealing with the <i>content</i> of the
psychotic experience is characteristic: self-denigration,
striving for acceptance from her husband, and disavowal
of the significance of her violent fantasies other than
claiming that they were further evidence of her worthlessness.
It is noteworthy that even in her psychotic state
"primary process" content appears in somewhat disguised
form. Her hostility thus returns grotesque and in

CATHERINE


The next account is a final example of psychosis arising
in the context of marital disharmony. Catherine had
been married for seven years and was the mother of three
children. From the first years of her marriage she had
been aware of real incompatibilities with her husband.
While a rather competent person during her adolescence,
she seemed to thrive on praise for her looks and apparently
developed minimal sense of herself or the course
she wanted her life to take. She was the favorite of a father
who was frequently, inexplicably, angry and punitive.
Her marriage to a man who was taciturn and controlling,
and with whom she shared few interests, was a
rather impulsive act. Children came rapidly and her
own needs and interests received low priority. In the
later years of her marriage divorce was frequently contemplated
and discussed, but the responsibilities and
loneliness of this prospect were apparently too frightening.
In the context of this tenuous life situation, Catherine's
mother fell ill with cancer. Catherine's acute
illness developed in this setting and was described by

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Where does this story begin. I am not sure, and
who knows where it will end. I guess for a point of
reference it began around Christmas of 1970 with a
phone call from Paris from my sister who seemed
very homesick and upset. She wanted very much for
me to visit her in Rome where she was in school
until the 15th of January. Although I was prepared
to visit her (shots and passport) I had decided not to
go as my husband wouldn't go with me, but because
of Janet's extremely agitated state, I promised
that I would meet her either in Paris or Rome about
the third of January. Well, I went, I saw and I guess
in a way, I conquered. I became myself again, interested
in all things, and a part of my surroundings.
In three days my sister had to leave for London
to pick up a ticket to the States, so I went to London
at the same time and planned to return to the States
on the 15th or the same day Jan was to go home.
After the Italian sunshine, the smog and foul air of
London just wasn't it, so I returned to Rome alone.
I had met students there and a staff member in the
school in the convent who was going to help me
find a place to stay either in or near the school. Why
I had to return to Rome I do not really know. I
wanted to get to know my way around as I believe I
belong there in a way. I had long ago given up on
my marriage and had planned to divorce my husband
after he went to school in February and things
were well in hand for him. Back in Rome, I learned
to get around on my own somewhat in three more
days of Italian sunshine and although I wasn't
ready to leave, as I wished to know the city and people
better for my next trip, I returned on the first

During all of this trip I felt very close to God, very
happy, and I thought a lot about my life and prayed
in the garden of the convent for love, wisdom, happiness,
etc., and for a man with whom I could share
life and love. All the things I had prayed for as a
child. One afternoon, in the garden, I looked up to
see a statue of Jesus in a "suffer little children to
come unto me" pose with hand outstretched. He
seemed to be calling to me—saying come here and
kneel at my feet. My heart was open to God but I
was too proud to kneel so I stood at the base of the
statue. And as it has since seemed, a miracle happened.
My life was given to me again—new, but
with all of the lessons I had already learned still
there. Perhaps it was the next day or the day after
—a Monday—on which I went to the airport—
two hours by bus, to return to Connecticut. At the
ticket counter I saw a man—a very rare man—
standing in my line of sight quietly. I thought
somewhere was a very happy woman. As it turned
out he identified with me as much as I with him. He
was a widower with three children who said "Do
you have a great belief in God?" and when I answered
"Yes" he said, "Then believe that God
meant for us to meet." This man spoke to me in
similes and while I thought I understood what he
meant when he answered my question "What is
your second favorite hobby" with a simple and
modest "You'll think this presumptious, but Life,"
I have since wondered about this answer. As to me
he gave Life and Love. A new Life and God's love.


After we landed in New York, he said he could

The trip from Rome to my home took in all
about 17 hours, and 24 hours of wakefulness before
I was able to get some rest because of the social
amenities involved in returning. The next morning
I was up before the sun, still being on Rome time,
and was for the rest of the week. I discovered that
home shared the same sun as Rome and that it
wasn't where one was but what one was that made
the difference. I was me, the real me. No more pretending
I could make a marriage from a terribly
lonely existence which had lasted for seven years.
No more praying to be strong enough to take only
responsibility for my life until my children were independent
enough so that I could start life over.
Jesus or rather God had given me a promise of a
new life through Jesus and John, the man I had
met. But as I told John when I called him two days
later to say goodbye, this was something I had to do
entirely on my own. My decisions had to be the
same decisions I would have to have if I had never
met him, the same truth had to apply to my life as
had applied before. No involvements for this Chick
(new words, now words, for me, not then words).


The first two days at home were a nightmare. My
husband, who had always been insanely jealous,
and who had questioned me many times before,

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I followed his advice until I tried to discuss the
divorce with my husband, and he appeared to be
cracking. I felt strong and sure of what I was doing.
I had no intention of cracking, so I tried to help
him. He promised to see a marriage counselor with
me, and I felt that the least this would accomplish
would be for us to understand what had happened

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During this time I had a lot of love for my children
and sometime somehow they had come to
know God. They taught me a great deal and I loved
them more than I ever had before, and I was very
proud of them. However, as Shakespeare said, a
wise father knows his own son, but my husband
does not know them.


During this time many new experiences were
mine. I shall try to explain. Perhaps it would be
relevant to say also at this point that I was dreaming
again. I had not dreamt for a long time. Also I felt
like a woman—my hormones were running around
like they were supposed to. My figure improved a
little and all in all I was healthier than I had been
for a very long time. I attribute these things to the
effect of being loved or feeling love.


My mother called about Friday to ask about the
trip. She sounded great and I forgot for the time
being that the doctor had only given her six months
to live. Barring miracles. I wanted to tell her about
this man I met as I felt she would be happy for me,
but I was not sure and I didn't want to upset her so I
kept my secret. The next day she was returned to the
hospital. I learned about it on Sunday morning,
and Sunday evening I took a nap and had a nightmare.
In my dream I was asked to give my life for
my mother and I refused. I felt she had lived as she
had chosen and my life was mine to live as I chose. I
couldn't give it up for anyone except for God.

The third dream was an empty dream. I heard
again as in the second a strange noise and my mind
was a total blank. I thought I was losing control of
my mind and I was scared. My mind seemed to be
expanding and when I came out of it, I wondered if
somewhere along the line someone had slipped me
some LSD as I imagined that this must be the kind
of effect one would have after taking a drug. I have
never taken drugs.


During the time I was home I began to read my
Bible. I knew God would help me to straighten out
my problems. I wanted to know exactly what the
Bible had to say about divorce and other questions.
I sought wisdom and truth. Seek and ye shall find,
knock and it shall be opened unto you. I sought, I
found a great deal and yet I knew there was more.
Even now I know there is more, but I think I will
not be part of the rest. My mind became a sponge. I
read philosophy for enlightenment and found only

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All of life on earth related to me. Music had
meaning, all music, and the meaning was life, and
life was mine. I began exercising and later I found
that the exercises were Yoga. I prayed a lot for guidance
from God and he helped me. Each new book
led to many more books and I began quitting the
books in the middle somewhere as I didn't have
time to finish them. Dante's "Paradiso" remains
unfinished. In my mind Beatrice corresponded to
John and the "Who are you" was the exact phrase I
used. The answer had been a simple "A man who
sat next to you on an airplane." And yet it was
much more and many people had sat next to me.
This was the first man I had ever met. A man who
had suffered great sorrow and loss and who could
love life because he knew the meaning of living.


The cross on my forehead began to grow heavy. I
could feel the lines in my forehead and occasionally
I would trace them when I thought of John. I felt
close to him even though he was at least 4,000 miles
away. His love was a day to day part of my life. Now
things began to happen. I knew my sisters as I never
had before. I came to know my neighbor and closest
friend. She understood what was happening to me
And I know my mother, a lioness, the mother of a
lioness, who was fighting every day for a life I

I felt very strongly that I had the power to heal. I
finally decided to help my mother if she wanted to
live and I held out my right hand and drew her illness
(cancer) from her stomach. The next day I went
to visit her. Again I (while staying at my husband's
parents) held out my hand to draw my mother's illness
from her. The next day when I visited my
mother in the hospital she said she felt the tumor in
her stomach shrinking. I couldn't believe this was
true. I said nothing except that she looked strong
and that I loved her. Still she had cancer in her
lungs and the doctor thought in her heart as she had
a heart beat of 200 for three hours one morning.
Still it was a matter that she could die any day barring
miracles.. I happen to believe in miracles.


On a Friday evening after I had promised myself
to John and God I began to feel that time was getting
short. That the time for learning was over and
time for action was near. Time was too short. I was
not wise, only learning. Decisions had to be made
and I could only, eventually, trust in God as His
way is true and right. So I gave up my decisions to
God eventually and prayed for help.


Friday evening my daughter stood on the edge of

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knew that I was postponing, procrastinating.
But I felt that for the sake of my husband and the
kids I had to do what I could to keep things in
hand. Unfortunately for me I tried too hard to make
the divorce easy for my husband. I cracked, broke,
whatever ...


Now I have to start over again. Back to my lawyer's
advice to get legal separation (have divorce papers
drawn up) and get away for a little while if I
can afford it. My mother is home from the hospital.
The day I cracked, I left in the middle of the early
A.M. to visit her as I was afraid she would die before
I could see her. I drove East into the rising sun and
arrived about seven A.M. She wasn't surprised to see
me so early. I told her I loved her and hugged her
and felt confident that she would be okay. Then I
drove around for awhile unsure of where to go and
what to do next. I wanted to see a minister but
didn't know one well enough to see him so early.


Finally I went to my dad's house, had breakfast,
and brought my books in to read from the car. I had
a feeling that this was my judgment day, the day of
my final test. My faith in God was being tested on
this day, and it was, and I proved true to God's love.
I felt that the sun could not set on me in my husband's
house, because I had vowed myself to God. I
was not well, I started hemorrhaging Saturday
night perhaps because I took one birth control pill,
then was sorry that I had, so I didn't take the next
20. I went back home through very bad driving

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I collapsed on the floor after yelling "Do you
want to die" and "They are killing me." My voice
was not mine, it was someone else saying "They are
killing me," and it was because of me that someone
I felt this close to was dying. My husband finally
opened the door and I went out to the car. I was in
terrible pain and hemorrhaging. I thought I was dying.
The ambulance came to, bring me to the hospital.
I placed my hand on my stomach and gradually
I became better. I don't know how long I was in the
hospital but when my husband came near me the
panic and sense of dying returned so I screamed at
him to go away and leave me alone. No doctor saw
me while I was there except Dr. Smith who came
about midnight. When he sat by the bed I immediately
felt better as though by holding up his hand
or just looking at me he had taken away my illness.
He brought me to this hospital and had my husband
drive the car and as long as Dr. Smith was
there it was okay. I felt somehow that he was protecting
me and I was glad for his presence. He was a
shepherd to me and I a little lost lamb. This hospital
frightened me for the first couple of days and to
that I attribute the rest of my strange behavior. Now
I feel well in hand and about ready to straighten out
my life.

<i>Comment</i>


This patient's marriage had fostered a continuation of
adolescent dependency upon a controlling parental figure
at the expense of her own aspirations for continued
growth and fulfillment. Hope for a more gratifying life
was held in check by her own needs for support and care.
The mother's illness apparently upset the balance and
revived the challenge of the conflict between security and
self-development. This account therefore illustrates the
manner in which life events and developmental demands
may specifically revive and test out certain character liabilities
of long standing, producing developmental impasse
which determines the timing of psychotic illness.


The state-determined aspects of her experience assumed
a "psychedelic" form.

We recognize the familiar enhanced sense of personal
meaning of external and internal perceptual data. The
content of the experience which pours forth in the altered
state suggests the specific conflicts with which she
is contending.

The three accounts presented in this chapter illustrate
the experiential structure of psychoses which have arisen
within the context of marriage. In all three instances the
writers had married extremely controlling husbands
with powerful dependency needs of their own, only thinly
veiled by their authoritarian behavior. These husbands
shared certain characteristics with the fathers of
these women, who were remembered as capriciously aggressive
and intimidating. The fathers had fostered a
kind of fearful compliance in their daughters and, curiously,
the daughters had perpetuated that interaction
by their choices of husbands. At what level of patterning

Themes related to unmet dependency needs are thus
encountered in the experiential fabric of psychoses arising
in this context. For example, infantile rage may
surge into psychotic consciousness in overt or disguised
form, as we have seen. Experiences of childhood may be
vividly recalled in great detail and wishful fantasies may
create the illusion that strong, supportive objects are in
fact available. Psychoses occurring in the context of marriage
invariably indicate that the dependency needs
brought to the relationship by both partners are greater
than the coalition can gratify.
