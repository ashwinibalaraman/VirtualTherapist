BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Again, they don't know who you are.  Okay, so, uh, all right, so listen, that psycho stuff.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Whatever, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	I just don't know what meds or whatever, like, if there's something palliative or am I—
<b>DR:</b>	I think you're a little OCD—ish.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But, see, a lot of people with anxiety problems, it goes into OCD neighborhood.  The treatment of choice by far for OCD is behavior therapy.
<b>PT:</b>	We've talked about that time and time again.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, and, well, but even kind of [INAUDIBLE] bibliotherapy or reading a book that teaches you specific techniques for essentially distracting your brain from these afferent loops they get into.
<b>PT:</b>	That's why I said I think I'm just not, I have nothing to preoccupy my time.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, so when there's nothing, no, you know, then you kind of gravitate towards these thoughts and these are better than a lot of things other people do.  They get negative thinking.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, sure.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Sure.
<b>DR:</b>	So but you should read a book Brain Lock.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I don't remember that one.  You may have.  I don't—
<b>DR:</b>	Barnes and Noble and just scan, you know, it's four people with official OCD.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But those techniques will help you.  The book is called Brain Lock, it's by Schwartz.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, what it does is it teaches you kind of the process for getting out of those loops.  The first step is recognizing your brain is kind of in a place where you don't want it to be.  And then, you know, visualization, counting backwards, you know, all different types of techniques to jumpstart you out of that.  Okay, so that should be in your back pocket before we even put, and of course you're on the medicines for it anyway.  I mean, Cymbalta at 180 is pretty good for OCD.  But, gee, you're on Strattera for the ADD.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, and again I know 2 sessions ago [INAUDIBLE] we broke it down and I don't, couldn't find that paper where we broke what down or what [INAUDIBLE] what kind of we were going to back off and what we, so I apologize, I don't remember—
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean, do you mean what diagnosis each medicine's for?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, let's first go through how you are now.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're not sad, but you're somewhat anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Still anxious.  Your appetite?
<b>PT:</b>	It's fine.
<b>DR:</b>	Sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Probably a little too much when I do.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean, when you do sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I find that if, like if I hear [NAME OTHER] getting up early at 5:30 in the morning I probably am more awake if I get up then too, I have more energy, I'm more awake, but if I wait until 7:30 or even 8:30, when I'm getting up at that time, I feel like I need more sleep and I go back to bed and then like I haven't found this little magic time where—
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	Like it's just—
<b>DR:</b>	Sounds like you should get out of bed early.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Sleeping in is not good for depression.
<b>PT:</b>	It almost seems like 5 1/2 hours is better for me than my old habits say no, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b>	Just the family stuff, but other than that, no.
<b>DR:</b>	What's so big going on in the family that you [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	It's just I'm finding out more background stuff about my father and his relationships that were going on behind my mother's back that I'm just, I'm the only 1 out of the 4 siblings that has found out, and my mother since divorced him and moved on, and she was abused and the 2 older brothers really didn't, um, my father kind of hid it from the kids and yet to make him seem like a better guy, kind of, she complied so he made up stuff about her to distract what he was doing.  So now everyone just wants to say okay they're divorced and everything's fine now, and yet I was the only one that protected her and my siblings kind of blame me for the divorce and I have, I'm kind of alone in all this with, they don't understand depression, so they kind of feel like you're a little whacked to begin with.  And they also blame me for the divorce.  And so not really close to any of them, and I accept that and my mother's safe and she's happy now and she's dating someone and enjoying it.  For the first time in her life she's truly happy I think and I have to just accept that, okay, I'm not close to my siblings, but my mother's safe and happy, but I'm finding out this other stuff about my father and that I might have a half brother in [DEIDENTIFIED] and they all live in [DEIDENTIFIED] and it's just like what do I do with this new info and I'm digesting it and I don't know.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	You're too old for this stuff to matter so much.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What are you, a kid?  Get over it.
<b>PT:</b>	I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Why, why does this stuff matter so much?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess because I still don't think my brothers treat my mother any better.
<b>DR:</b>	So.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I'm getting to.  I'm getting to that, so.  But like I didn't need to find out, like I was getting to that so and I was getting to okay and then to find out that we went to high school with this woman and like my parents met and lived in [DEIDENTIFIED] and we moved out to this little tiny farm town way out and then this woman that my dad.
<b>DR:</b>	You've told me this story.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like I just found out and it's just like why did I have to find that out?  Let it go.
<b>DR:</b>	Why is this relevant?  This, you put on equal relevance with getting a job and getting a husband and moving forward in your life?  This is ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's because of my brother, [NAME OTHER], who controls my mother's finances treats the women in our family and my mother and me, and he was paying for my doctor's visits before, he was kind of like, yeah, I'll pay for everything, but I'm going to treat you like shit.  And I said, 8, 10 months ago, I said I don't want you to do anything for me if that's how you're going to treat me because I was feeling better and I was like I don't need your help if that's how you're going to [INAUDIBLE].  So, um—
<b>DR:</b>	It still doesn't make sense to me that this is front and center in your life.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's why I didn't move back to [DEIDENTIFIED] because it would have been more front and center.  So I'm trying to make choices where it isn't.  I'm trying to just say, I'm just trying to accept it.  It is what it is is what I'm trying to get to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Why is it relevant?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	You've got a serious lifestyle now, that's far more relevant than this fight.  You know, moving forward in your career, and socially.
<b>PT:</b>	For 7 years nothing meant anything when I was depressed, nothing.  There was no wants, nothing meant anything.  It was kind of like just—
<b>DR:</b>	Which 7 years?
<b>PT:</b>	That I was depressed.  I didn't look forward to anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So it's like just now [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, you've not been that depressed for a long time.
<b>PT:</b>	But I didn't have that want, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  That was gone.
<b>DR:</b>	Didn't have what?
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't have that want.  I didn't, there was nothing that I looked forward to.  So when I would come in here and say that things were better, it meant things were better than they were, but I didn't, I didn't know that I could get that want back and that to me is, to me that's my definition for me of depression.
<b>DR:</b>	That's too abstract.  [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, I don't know about that.
<b>PT:</b>	To me that's been my definition of depression is that lack of want.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, but anyway, that's, you're distracting me away from my main point which is you're obsessing over this—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Family of origin nonsense.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Who cares?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You just turned [AGE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know I did.
<b>DR:</b>	Who cares?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Happy birthday.
<b>PT:</b>	Thanks.
<b>DR:</b>	Who cares.  Get yourself a husband and a job and let this stuff go.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think that's as serious as I—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I will.
<b>DR:</b>	No, you won't.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, I will.  Wait and see me next visit.  I will.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Every single time you think about anything to do with your family treat it like it's contamination, like an OCD contamination, right, like people who touch the doorknob and feel like they got germs and have to go wash 50 times, treat it that way.  Push it aside and do something to move your life forward.  You'll do better.  Don't you agree that you'll do better that way?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, no, I will.
<b>DR:</b>	It such, it sucks, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I will.
<b>DR:</b>	It's really a waste of time.
<b>PT:</b>	It is, it's a waste of time and energy and effort.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll speak for your family, they don't like you when you do this.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, no, they don't, none of them do.
<b>DR:</b>	No one appreciates it, I promise you.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, but here's something that continues.  I still every night will talk in my sleep and it'll come out and it'll be about my father, it'll be about my brother, it'll be about my family and it'll be subconsciously, it's not I want it to, it's not even stuff that is relevant to today, last week, last month.  It happens every night.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, listen, we've been through this before and the point is some people, for some people it's very important to express their deepest, in conflicts and what happened and all that.  For other people it's very important to seal it over and get over it.
<b>PT:</b>	Got it, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You need to seal it over.  You don't want to express [INAUDIBLE], ignore everything.  Push it away, denial, ignore it all.  Push it all away.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think my subconscious can handle that?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Stop being so grandiose.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	It's just ideas, it's just, it's really, you know, why is it so important?  Push it away, irrelevant, push it all away.  You'll do better that way.  Seal it off.  So therapy would probably help you too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, sure.  Here's the thing is that when I have nightmares it's either about my family or it's about me and it's so vivid and scary terrifying that I never like even finish middle school or got my high school degree or college that it zeroes in around education.  And I didn't finish college and, um, and my IQ was just as high my brother, [NAME OTHER]'s, who went to some ivy league school.  And, um, I dropped my keys, like I do all these things like when I was reading all the symptoms that this pharmaceutical companies put out for you for their drugs, like it just seems like—
<b>DR:</b>	That's the last thing we need.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The last thing you need is a stimulant.  And we're aggressively treating your attention deficit.  A dose of Cymbalta of 180 plus Strattera of 60 is, remember, attention deficit is treated with high norepinephrine essentailly, which is also what Adderall does.  And have you tried Ritalin in the past?  Yeah, you were on Ritalin for a long time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I don't know that we ever really played around with the amount.
<b>DR:</b>	We gave, you were on very healthy doses.
<b>PT:</b>	I was?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you were on 40 mg long acting plus 20 of the short acting.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you remember, it was either with Ritalin or one of them where I felt tired.  And when I called into the company to see, they said well when you're tired you kind of need it, like it's that kind of thing, where?
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know.  Well, sometimes people get this idiosyncratic reaction.  You mean the Ritalin made you tired?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it happens sometimes.  Next year we'll do the same thing.  Adderall will do the same thing.  And it can make some people sad.  [INAUDIBLE].  All right.
<b>PT:</b>	And here's my other concern with looking for work.  I'm afraid of getting fired.  You know, I've been fired before.  And it goes along with that whole like not being able to follow the directions and not being able to, um, in college, it's kind of like that whole thing, I learn different than other people and I process information differently than other people.
<b>DR:</b>	What does that have to do with feeling tired?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it just seems like if you tell me something in 5 steps, I would, I would, I would go to process that slightly different and get the same end result, but if you're standing over me be like that's not the way that I told you to go about doing it, even though it was a different end result.  And some people don't like that.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you get fired for personality conflicts.
<b>PT:</b>	And that too.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  And so that you're going to need to know inside and out, it's the ways in which you [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	But it's more so with the workload in that, um, you know, I told you to do A, B, and C, and you thought that C was more important because, I mean, it's the—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right, exactly.  It's an authority complex, I mean, it's, you—
<b>PT:</b>	But I honestly, I'm thinking that I'm helping that person by what they said, not because I'm thinking—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you're not playing by the rules.  You're not playing by the rules and it's [INAUDIBLE] entitlement and grandiose thinking [INAUDIBLE] when you're really under someone else's rules.  So you're unconsciously probably revolting [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And with some psychotherapy you can get insight into the ways in which you're provoked.  And then hold them in check so you can keep the jobs.  You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You've got to get a job anyway.  I mean, I know it's a terrible experience to be fired and to have conflicts, but you've got to work hard to not have conflict.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm still having 2, twice a month I'm still having 2 or 3 days where I'm exhausted.  Don't get me wrong, if I had a job I'd be pulling myself probably out of bed easier.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right, right.  And also getting out of bed earlier is probably, sleep is bad for depression.  Now have you felt revved up in any way?  Racing thoughts, talking too much?
<b>PT:</b>	Racing thoughts probably, I mean, would that include like my sister in law and having those thoughts in my head [INAUDIBLE]?  Probably, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How long did that last?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know how to answer that.  I don't know if it's really stopped.  I don't, I don't know.  Can you try to give me some insight on how to [INAUDIBLE] or—
<b>DR:</b>	No?  You got really mad.  You know, you cycle a little bit.  But, you know, not that much.  Yeah, I mean, you're a little bit.
<b>PT:</b>	I go off I think.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  You go off.  You're reactive.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Reactive.
<b>PT:</b>	I am.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean we have you on, we don't have you on much in the way of mood stabilizers, but having you on such aggressive treatment for depression contains that reasonably well.  I don't think it's worth throwing too much more at your brain.  You know, you're on very aggressive regimen.
<b>PT:</b>	There's nothing else just to help me just with the job coming up and just getting by?
<b>DR:</b>	What job coming up?
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, just, some interviewing, like I've got this one interview went really well and then they told me, they took, I wrote great letters, it took me a long time, but I wrote great letters and then last week, um, I was like one of the three finalists and then they said, um, well, we haven't made a final decision, hang in there, would you be willing to come in for a day and actually pretend and do work for the day?  And I said absolutely tell me when.  And I, so that sounded like, okay, we'll bring you right in.  I didn't hear anything.  So when I sent a second e—mail 2 days later saying, you know, I'm available Monday and Tuesday, but of course whenever your schedule works for you.  And both times, I said, you know, feel free to call me.  I didn't hear anything.  And with the way that I am like I'm so ready to be like okay, um, I was holding out for this job, but now I'm going to be looking for another one, you know what I mean, like that's my strung out, and I've been sitting on my hands, you know.  And so now it's been like a week and a half.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you're feeling jerked around like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I'm also like, like they're very honest up front and I'm very honest and up front too, it's just kind of like well, like I wanted to let them know I have been waiting, you know, should I?
<b>DR:</b>	No, no, no.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I can't.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a power dynamic.  You have to, A, accept that they have the power, you don't.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, but it's not like, and what I'm saying is if you could, if there is, I've always been aggressive in therapy.
<b>DR:</b>	There's no drug for that.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't mean drugs for that, but, I mean a drug to help me with just right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Psychotherapy, psychotherapy for insight, develop insight into these challenges you have.  I mean, a cognitive based psychotherapy, you know, I can give something that describes that therapy that will benefit you.  Anyway, as far as the meds go, you're in pretty good shape.
<b>PT:</b>	There's no room to play around.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, the only thing I would add, and we've done it before, is mood stabilizers.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think you get much from them.  I don't think you cycle that much.  You know, I think you have anxiety but your—
<b>PT:</b>	But I wasn't like this before.  This isn't me.  It's [INAUDIBLE] who I was.
<b>DR:</b>	When?
<b>PT:</b>	My 20's.  People that know me from before.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[LAUGHING] Okay I'll accept that.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, you've got a dad loser and [INAUDIBLE] huge doses, but with these doses you're in the game.  I don't see you trying hard enough.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	To, you know, to play your world, the non medication world.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Play in your world.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Go after these challenges and the worse thing you can do is focus on mommy and daddy nonsense.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Focus on job stuff.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe I'll try yoga or something is what you're saying?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, no, the issue, you just came up with, you just keep getting fired.  That's more important than whatever daddy was doing.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You getting fired regularly is something you should figure out what's coming from you and get [INAUDIBLE] get a job.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I started out working with kids because I was, had such a great personality and had patience and that's where my life was going.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Cymbalta you're on 180 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's a keeper.  And, you know, and that dose is obviously beyond anyone's range.  The Topamax, does that continue, uh, at 10?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, it seems like it's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It is?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So I'm not that impressed with Topamax as a mood medicine but if you like it [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	You know, at one point I thought it had stopped, but I don't know if it's just things in general or, can that effect wear off?
<b>DR:</b>	It usually doesn't.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It usually doesn't.  This describes the kind of psychotherapy I think [INAUDIBLE].  Um, all right, the Wellbutrin, you're on 300.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you take trazodone every night?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	And Strattera you take 60?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yes, sometimes I, if I run out I have the 80 pills.
<b>DR:</b>	So 60 to 80.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, you know, I think we're kind of stuck with this regimen.  We're kind of stuck with this regimen.  And despite what you've said, I think you're doing fine.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Um, and that one, uh, that you mentioned, what was that one?
<b>DR:</b>	Adderall?
<b>PT:</b>	Adderall.  Is there something I'm taking here that's similar?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Already?
<b>DR:</b>	The, uh, well, hold on, let me shut this off.
