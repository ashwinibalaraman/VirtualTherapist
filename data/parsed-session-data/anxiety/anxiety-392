Psychological maltreatment has been conceptualized as consisting of psychological
abuse or neglect occurring alone, occurring in association with other forms
of abuse and neglect, and as the embedded psychological context behind other
forms of abuse and neglect (Binggeli, Hart, &amp; Brassard, 2001).


Empirical research suggests that the most
common and lasting effects of physical
abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect tend to be
related to associated and embedded psychological
experiences. In addition, several
studies have indicated that emotional abuse
or neglect, occurring alone, is associated
with negative effects of a severity equal to or
greater than other forms of abuse (Hart,
Binggeli, &amp; Brassard, 1998; also see "Evidence
of Impact" section of this chapter).
Thus, psychological maltreatment may be
thought of as a unifying concept that embodies
many of the most significant components
of child abuse and neglect.


The term <i>psychological maltreatment</i> is preferred
because it denotes a category that is
sufficiently broad to include both the cognitive
and affective meanings of maltreatment
(psychological) as well as perpetrator acts of
both commission and omission (maltreatment).

Although increased attention has been
given to psychological maltreatment over
the past two decades, this attention still lags
substantially behind that given to other
forms of maltreatment. For example, as one
of many reforms in the response to child
sexual abuse, it is now common for children's
advocacy centers to take a lead role in
coordinating the responses of many professionals
for interventions with victims of sexual
abuse. There has been no similar effort
focused on coordination of services for psychological
maltreatment victims.


Nevertheless, significant progress has
been made in several relevant domains, including
definitions, measurement strategies,
and studies of prevalence and relationships
to various forms of dysfunctional behavior.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that a
broad consensus among child maltreatment
experts has been achieved on evaluation
standards for the suspected psychological
maltreatment of children and adolescents
(American Professional Society on the
Abuse of Children [APSAC], 1995). Recent
developments in this knowledge will be
integrated in the following sections of this
chapter.

<b>Creating Definitions</b>

The establishment of an adequate definition
of psychological maltreatment has been
perhaps the most fundamental challenge to
advances in dealing with this topic. There
are many inherent difficulties in producing
such definitions, encompassing numerous
complex philosophical, scientific, legal, political,
and cultural issues. Despite these significant
challenges, considerable progress
has been made over the past 20 years in articulating
rationally defensible definitions
that appear to have substantial professional
and public support.


In a landmark national law on child
abuse, an aspect of psychological maltreatment
was included under the category of
"mental injury" (Public Law 93-247, originally
passed in 1974). Following this, numerous
attempts were made to elaborate this
ambiguous category in national policy and
state law (Hart, Germain, &amp; Brassard, 1987).
These early attempts to achieve widely accepted
definitions were not very successful
(Holder, Newberger, &amp; Loken, 1983). In the
early 1980s, the lack of adequate definitions
was recognized to be <i>the</i> major impediment
to progress in research and practice in this
area. In response, the International Conference
on Psychological Abuse of the Child
was held in 1983 to stimulate progress. This
conference, with professionals representing
virtually all the helping professions
and major child advocacy groups as well
as eight countries, produced the following
definition:
<blockquote>
<p>
Psychological maltreatment of children and
youth consists of acts of omission and commission,
which are judged on the basis of a
combination of community standards and
professional expertise to be psychologically
damaging. Such acts are committed by individuals,
singly or collectively; who by their
characteristics (e.g., age, status, knowledge,
and organizational form) are in a position of
differential power that renders a child vulnerable.
Such acts damage immediately or ultimately
the behavioral, cognitive, affective, or
physical functioning of the child. Examples of
psychological maltreatment include acts of rejecting,
terrorizing, isolating, exploiting, and
missocializing. (<i>Proceedings</i>, 1983)

Since the 1983 conference, significant
conceptual and empirical progress has been
made to further elaborate the definition of
psychological maltreatment. Baily and Baily
(1986) asked a large number of respondents
from different protective service professions
to rate and refine statements representing
potential acts of "emotional maltreatment"
and then organized these into 16 categories.
Drawing on this research and previous conceptual
work, Garbarino, Guttman, and
Seeley (1986) and Hart et al. (1987) each
produced similar sets of categorical systems.


From this base, Hart and Brassard (1986,
1989-1991; also see Brassard, Hart, &amp;
Hardy, 1993) conducted a federally funded
research project, incorporating literature review,
expert opinion, and empirical research,
to produce operationally defined
measures of emotional maltreatment that
are now widely accepted. As a part of this research,
a multidimensional scale was developed
to rate parental behaviors in a videotaped
interaction with their children.
Psychological maltreatment was found to be
reliably distinguished from appropriate
caregiving and differentiated into distinct
categories. Administered to a sample of 49
high-risk mother-child dyads, the scales enabled

The present status of defining psychological
maltreatment is best represented in the
<i>Guidelines for the Psychosocial Evaluation of Suspected
Psychological Maltreatment in Children and
Adolescents</i> of the American Professional Society
on Abuse of Children (APSAC, 1995).
These guidelines were produced through a
lengthy and rigorous process of development
involving submission for review by
child maltreatment experts, including the
APSAC membership and board of directors.
This document contains consideration
of issues relating to forensic assessment. It
includes the following broad conceptual
statement and psychological maltreatment
categories:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
- <i>Psychological maltreatment</i> means a repeated
pattern of caregiver behavior or extreme incident(s)
that convey to children that they
are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted,
endangered, or only of value in meeting another's
needs (APSAC 1995, p. 2).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
- Psychological maltreatment includes (a)
spurning, (b) terrorizing, (c) isolating, (d)
exploiting/corrupting, (e) denying emotional
responsiveness, and (f) mental
health, medical, and educational neglect.

- <i>Psychological maltreatment</i> means a repeated
pattern of caregiver behavior or extreme incident(s)
that convey to children that they
are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted,
endangered, or only of value in meeting another's
needs (APSAC 1995, p. 2).


- Psychological maltreatment includes (a)
spurning, (b) terrorizing, (c) isolating, (d)
exploiting/corrupting, (e) denying emotional
responsiveness, and (f) mental
health, medical, and educational neglect.


Table 4.1, from the APSAC guidelines,
presents the above six categories of psychological
maltreatment with detailed subcategories
that further clarify their meanings
(Hart &amp; Brassard, 1986, 1989-1991).


When considering the psychological
maltreatment categories in Table 4.1, it is
important to note that rejection does not
have a category of its own but is represented,
primarily, in two of the categories
and is probably a factor in all categories. Rejection
has been determined to embody two
distinct patterns of caretaker behavior
(Rohner &amp; Rohner, 1980). In the first form,
<i>spurning</i>, the mental attitude of hostility is expressed
through caretaker acts of behavioral
(including verbal) hostility and aggression
toward a child (acts of commission). In the
second form, <i>denying emotional responsiveness</i>,
the mental attitude of indifference is manifested
behaviorally in a caretaker's neglect
of a child's emotional needs (acts of omission).


The above definitions have been subjected
to additional empirical validation.
This includes research that has developed
measurement strategies and examined
the correlates of psychological maltreatment,
as well as studies that have surveyed
professional and public opinion regarding
definitions. Claussen and Crittenden (1991)
investigated the parenting and child development
outcomes for children averaging 4
years, 4 months of age for child populations
of reported maltreatment, mental health
treatment, and normative conditions. Drawing
on the above definitional work, the researchers
developed an instrument to measure
parental psychological maltreatment.
They found that although physical and psychological
abuse were likely to occur together
for the reported sample, (a) psychological
maltreatment often occurred alone in
the community sample, (b) parental psychological
maltreating behavior was the strongest
predictor of developmental outcomes,
and (c) psychological maltreatment was
more predictive of detrimental outcomes
than the severity of physical injury. Crittenden,
Claussen, and Sugarman (1994) found
similar results in a related study that examined
the functioning of adolescents who
had been reported for suspected physical
abuse, physical neglect, or psychological
maltreatment.


The credibility of the spurning and denying
emotional responsiveness categories has
been further supported by the longitudinal
research Minnesota Mother-Child Interaction
Project, which followed at-risk children
from before birth to adulthood
(Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987; Erickson, Egeland,
&amp; Pianta, 1989). This research found
that spurning may be as damaging to psychosocial
development as physical abuse
and that denying emotional responsiveness
may be the most devastating of all forms of
maltreatment (see Chapter 1, this volume).


Since the early 1990s, strategies and instruments
designed to measure dimensions
of psychological maltreatment have proliferated,
most of them created with an explicit
acknowledgment of the influence of the definitional
work outlined earlier. Barnett,
Manley, and Cicchetti (1991) described a

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two studies have surveyed professional
and public opinion regarding the definition
of psychological maltreatment. These studies
provide preliminary evidence of a broad
societal consensus that psychological maltreatment
is both recognizable and serious.
Burnett (1993) surveyed the opinions of 452
social workers and 381 members of the general
public regarding 20 vignettes of possible
psychological abuse involving "latency age"
children (ages 7-11). These vignettes were
based largely on definitions that are similar
to those above. Respondents were asked to
state whether the vignette was abuse or not,
how serious it was, and what should be
done. Burnett found considerable agreement
between both groups that 18 of the 20
vignettes constituted abuse, including behaviors
representing isolating, spurning,
corrupting/exploiting, terrorizing, and denying
emotional responsiveness. The results
of the seriousness scale showed that the
mean for all vignettes was more than 3.52
(between "serious" and "quite serious").
The overall mean for the "what to do" scale
was between "refer for counseling" and "refer
to court." Citizen and social worker ratings
were essentially the same, and when
they differed, it was the citizens who wanted
more drastic interventions.


Portwood (1999) surveyed 323 mental
health, legal, and medical professionals as
well as parents and adult nonparents regarding
their opinions about raring the relative
importance of various factors in deciding
whether a specific caregiver act constitutes
child maltreatment. A broad consensus resulted
among the five respondent groups
that the most important factors were actual
physical or psychological harm to the child,
possible physical or psychological harm to
the child, and seriousness and frequency of
the act. Each of these factors was rated
above a 6 on a 7-point scale of importance by
all respondent groups. Ratings indicated
that respondents considered psychological
harm to be as important as physical harm in
defining maltreatment. Furthermore, all respondent
groups gave relatively high ratings
to a vignette depicting a parent screaming at
a child and calling a child names, indicating
support for the view that this behavior constitutes
maltreatment.

<b>Complex and Controversial Conceptual Issues</b>

The above work may be regarded as significant
progress in establishing a broad
foundation for definition and action. However,
numerous complex and potentially
controversial issues remain for further articulation,
research, debate, and consensus
building. These include
<table>

A stimulating discussion and debate of many
of these problems appeared in a special issue
of <i>Development and Psychopathology</i> ("Psychological
Maltreatment," 1991), which contained
14 articles representing a diversity
of views from researchers and policy analysts.
Next, we briefly address some of these
issues.

definitions,


(b) sensitivity to the varied purposes that the
definition is to serve,

<b>Stated Purpose of the Definition</b>


Maltreatment is defined in many diverse
contexts, including the domains of research,
mental health practice, law, and social policy.

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Specific criteria for definitions and evaluation</i>.
Psychological maltreatment has been defined
in terms of perpetrator acts, rather
than effects on the child (APSAC, 1995).
Acts are judged to be maltreatment based on
their nature, including factors such as severity,
frequency, and meaning. The potential
for immediate and long-term harm may be
an additional consideration. However, as
maltreatment is defined in terms of perpetrator
acts, many authors have argued that the
definition should not require that children
suffer demonstrable harm (e.g., Garbarino,
1991; Navarre, 1987). Acts must be assessed
in their ecological context to determine if
they place a child at a significant risk for
harm or violate the standard of care. This
context includes factors such as the nature
of the relationship of the child to the perpetrator,
the developmental stage of the child,
and the culture in which the acts occur. The
developmental stage of the child requires
special consideration in the formation of
specific definitions and in the evaluation of
individual cases (APSAC, 1995). Although
categories such as terrorizing and denying
emotional responsiveness may be universally
defined as maltreatment, the specific
behaviors constituting each category may
vary somewhat depending on the child's developmental
stage. For research purposes,
variables other than perpetrator acts (e.g.,
perpetrator intents, the child's subjective appraisals)
may be conceptualized as moderator
variables that are not part of the definition
of maltreatment but are factors that
determine whether harm will occur (Belsky,
1991).


<b>Sensitivity to
Cultural Context</b>


Social ethics require the consideration of
cultural differences in the acceptability and
meaning of certain practices (see American
Psychological Association, 1992; Sternberg
&amp; Lamb, 1991; see Chapter 23, this volume).
Cultures vary in their values and their
goals for human development (Belsky,
1991). In addition, superficially similar
practices may have different meanings and
effects in different cultural contexts. Thus,
professionals in all fields must be sensitive to
cultural factors in defining and evaluating
maltreatment (APSAC, 1995).

<b>Incidence and Prevalence</b>

The concepts of incidence and prevalence
are used in epidemiology to describe
rates of phenomena in a population
(Torrence, 1997). In the child maltreatment
literature, incidence most often refers to the
number of new cases that come to the attention
of authorities during a particular year,
whereas prevalence frequently represents
the total number of people in a sample who
have ever experienced abuse. The true incidence
of psychological maltreatment is not
known. In part, this is because previous
studies have used inadequate definitions,
measurement strategies, and recording procedures
and because of the undoubtedly
large number of unreported cases. However,
there are now sufficient data from studies
using definitions similar to those above
to provide a rough estimate of the prevalence
of childhood histories of psychological
maltreatment in the adult general population
of the United States. We believe that
these studies provide a more accurate estimate
of the true scope of psychological maltreatment
than the more commonly eked official
reports.


According to the National Committee to
Prevent Child Abuse (now called Prevent
Child Abuse America), in 1997, 3,195,000
children (or 4.6% of all children) were reported
for child abuse and neglect to child
protective services (CPS) agencies in the
United States (Wang &amp; Daro, 1998). In the
same year, CPS confirmed 1,054,000 children
(or 1.5% of all children) as victims of
child maltreatment. Of these confirmed

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The National Incidence Study, funded by
the National Center on Child Abuse and
Neglect (now the Federal Office on Child
Abuse and Neglect), is generally considered
to provide a more accurate estimate of the
annual incidence of child abuse and neglect
than reports from CPS agencies (Sedlak &amp;
Broadhurst, 1996). This study applies standardized
definitions to all cases known to
child welfare agencies as well as to local social
service, health, and law enforcement
professionals. The definitions incorporate a
"harm standard," which only includes children
who experienced documented harm,
and an "endangerment standard," which includes
children who experienced abuse or
neglect that put them at risk of harm. More
than 1.5 million children were estimated to
be abused or neglected in the United States
in 1993 under the harm standard and nearly
3 million under the endangerment standard.
The latter standard also resulted in an estimate
of approximately 532,200 children being
emotionally abused and 585,100 children
being emotionally neglected in that
year.


In a telephone incidence survey of a nationally
representative sample of 3,458 parents,
Vissing, Straus, Gelles, and Harrop
(1991) asked parents about their use of verbal
or symbolic aggression with their children.
Verbal or symbolic aggression was defined
as "communication intended to cause
psychological pain to another person, or a
communication perceived as having that intent"
(p. 224). Sixty-three percent of the parents
reported one or more instances of verbal
aggression occurring in the previous
year. Children who were victims of verbal
aggression experienced an average of at
least 12.6 such attacks during that year. In
the absence of standards of how frequent
verbal aggression needs to be before it is
considered abusive, the authors computed
three thresholds to produce three estimates
of the annual incidence of verbally abused
children. If the criterion is set at 10 or more,
the rate is 267 per 1,000 children (or 26.7%).
If the criterion is 20 or more, the rate is 138
per 1,000 children (or 13.8%). If the criterion
is 25 or more (exceeding twice a month
on average), the rate is 113 per 1,000 children
(or 11.3%). The rates reported in this
study are likely to be lower than the actual
rates because they are based on the reports
of parents who may be reluctant to report
the full extent of verbal aggression they use
with their children. In addition, it must be
recognized that the survey dealt only with a
limited set of the verbal behaviors that fall
under the broader categories of psychological
maltreatment.


A number of studies have collected data
regarding the prevalence of childhood histories
of one or more dimensions of psychological
maltreatment by retrospectively surveying
adults about their childhood
experiences (e.g., Buntain-Ricklefs, Kemper,
Bell, &amp; Babonis, 1994; Gross &amp; Keller, 1992;
Hemenway, Solnick, &amp; Carter, 1994;
Moeller, Bachman, &amp; Moeller, 1993). For example,
Gross and Keller (1992) assessed for
the presence of a history of childhood psychological
and physical abuse in a sample of
260 college students. Of the total sample,
20.61% were classified as having histories of
psychological abuse only, and an additional
16.67% reported histories of combined psychological
and physical abuse, producing a
total of 37.28% with psychological abuse histories.
In another study, Moeller et al.
(1993) assessed the rates of emotional, physical,
and sexual abuse in a community sample
of 668 women using a self-administered
anonymous questionnaire. The subjects
were predominantly White, well educated,
and middle class. More than 37% (250) of
the women reported experiences that met
the criteria for emotional abuse, either alone
or in combination with other forms, and
15% experienced it occurring alone. Physical
abuse, in isolation or in combination,
was indicated by the responses of 25.3% of
the women, and nearly 20% reported experiences
of sexual abuse.


Binggeli et al. (2001) reviewed this literature
and estimated that psychological maltreatment
may have been a significant presence
in the childhood histories of more than
one third of the general adult population of
the United States. By examining the data
and the definitions used to produce them,
they estimated that approximately 10% to
15% of all people have experienced the more
severe and chronic forms of this maltreatment.
They also emphasized that the definitions

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Evidence of Impact</b>

For more than 30 years, expert opinion
and clinical findings have identified serious
consequences to children associated with
psychological maltreatment. The American
Humane Association (Wald, 1991) and the
National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect
(Broadhurst, 1984) both published the
following list of disorders as representative
of possible psychological maltreatment consequences:
habit disorders, conduct disorders,
neurotic traits, psychoneurotic reactions,
behavior extremes, overly adaptive
behaviors, lags in development, and attempted
suicide. A review of relevant literature
by Hart et al. (1987) found psychological
maltreatment, broadly defined,
associated with the following problems:
poor appetite, lying and stealing, encopresis
and enuresis, low self-esteem or negative
self-concept, emotional instability or emotional
maladjustment, reduced emotional responsiveness,
inability to become independent,
incompetence or underachievement,
inability to trust others, depression, prostitution,
failure to thrive, withdrawal, suicide,
and homicide.


In this section, the highlights of findings
from more recent reviews of evidence of the
known and probable effects of psychological
maltreatment will be presented. The findings
in this area have been reported in
greater detail in Hart, Binggeli, and Brassard
(1998) and in Binggeli et al. (2001). The
available evidence will be presented under
two major categories that support the position
that psychological maltreatment is the
core component in child abuse and neglect
and that further illustrate accumulating
knowledge of its destructive power.


<b>Impact Evidence Supporting
Core Component Status</b>


Three bases of impact research exist in
support of the position that psychological
maltreatment is the core component of child
abuse and neglect: (a) longitudinal (prospective)
research, (b) cross-cultural research,
and (c) studies allowing comparison of the
impact of different forms of maltreatment.
Highlights of studies of this nature are provided
in the discussion that follows.


<i>Longitudinal research</i> focusing specifically
on psychological maltreatment occurred in
six studies that are reviewed briefly here.
The Minnesota Mother-Child Interaction
Project (Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987; Egeland,
Sroufe, &amp; Erickson, 1983; Erickson et al.,
1989) followed from birth to adulthood the
care and development of children born to
mothers at risk for caretaking problems.
The researchers identified five groups of
families differentiated according to the presence
or absence of five forms of treatment,
including physical abuse, hostile or verbal
abuse, physical and health care neglect, psychologically
unavailable caretaking (i.e., denying
emotional responsiveness), and adequate
care. Comparisons with the control
group have consistently shown that maltreatment,
including psychological maltreatment,
has serious consequences beyond
simply being raised in a disadvantaged environment.
Children of hostile or verbally
abusive mothers were equally negatively affected
as compared with children of physically

on children of psychologically unavailable

The Lehigh longitudinal study (Herrenkohl,
Egolf, &amp; Herrenkohl, 1997; Herrenkohl,
Herrenkohl, &amp; Egolf, 1983; Herrenkohl,
Herrenkohl, Egolf, &amp; Wu, 1991;
Herrenkohl, Herrenkohl, Toedter, &amp; Yanushefski,
1984) investigated five parent-child
interaction patterns to determine the developmental
consequences of child maltreatment.
Families of children were followed
who were categorized as falling in five study
groups: abuse families labeled by child welfare,
protective-service families labeled neglectful
but not abusive and served by child
welfare, Head Start families, day care children,
and middle-income families with children
in private nursery school programs.
Preschool children who experienced spurning
and terrorizing in acts of criticizing, verbal
rejection, and threats of punishment and
physical abuse were likely to become
school-age children who felt unloved, inadequate,
and angry (i.e., with low self-esteem
and likely to be aggressive). Levels of
assaultive behavior in adolescence were
judged to be influenced by their early childhood
experiences, which exemplified terrorizing,
spurning, or corrupting/ exploiting.


Loeber and Strouthamer-Loeber (1986)
conducted a meta-analysis of longitudinal
research on delinquency and concluded that
socialization variables, such as parental rejection
and lack of parent-child involvement
and supervision (i.e., spurning and denying
emotional responsiveness), were among the
most powerful predictors of juvenile delinquency.


The Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study,
a 40-year investigation, followed 253 males
to determine relationships between early
conditions of psychological care and treatment
and later adolescent or adult characteristics
(McCord, 1983; McCord, McCord,
&amp; Zola, 1959). Discipline that is erratic and
punitive or lax and parenting that is rejecting,
neglectful, or cruel were found to particularly
predispose children to crime. These
conditions were also associated with child
histories of emotional instability, substance
abuse, and high mortality.


Lefkowitz, Eron, Walder, and Huesmann
(1977) conducted a longitudinal study of the
development of aggression, beginning with
an extensive study of a nationally representative
sample of 875 eight-year-old students
of both genders and following them to
young adulthood. Predictors of child aggression
in the third grade were parental rejection,
low parental nurturance, and punishment
for aggression when the child had
low or only moderate identification with
parents (i.e., spurning and denying emotional
responsiveness by caretakers). The
strongest predictor of aggression at age 19
was the degree of aggression observed in
third grade.


Ney, Fung, and Wickett (1994) followed
167 children, identified as experiencing five
types of maltreatment, from years 7 through
18 of their development. Verbal abuse (i.e.,
spurning) and emotional neglect (i.e., denying
emotional responsiveness) were judged
to significantly influence the development of
negative effects on feelings and perspectives
about enjoyment of living, purpose in life,
prospects for future life, chances of having a
happy marriage, and expectations for being
a good parent. In combination, verbal abuse
and emotional neglect experiences were associated
with the most devastating outcomes.


Cross-cultural research was conducted
by Rohner and Rohner (1980) to investigate
the impact of rejection in dozens of anthropological
studies conducted in a wide variety
of the world's cultures. They studied the
antecedents and consequences of parental
acceptance-rejection and emotional abuse.
Two forms of rejection were found, one representing
parental indifference and neglect
(i.e., denying emotional responsiveness) and
one representing parental hostility and aggression
(i.e., spurning). Their research revealed
that such rejection produced negative
effects in children in every culture
studied. Rejected children tended to have an
impaired sense of self-esteem and self-adequacy;
to be emotionally unstable, emotionally
unresponsive, and aggressive; and to
have a negative worldview.


Comparative research, making it possible
to distinguish between the relative impact of
different types of abuse and neglect, has
been growing and now provides a large
body of useful information. Some of the
findings from the longitudinal studies already
mentioned are helpful in this regard.
Egeland and associates (Egeland &amp; Erickson,
1987; Egeland et al., 1983; Erickson
et al., 1989) found hostile verbal abuse to
be similar to physical abuse in its negative
impact on children and psychologically un
available caretaking to be the most devastating
of all maltreatment forms studied.
McCord (1983) concluded that although
child abuse and neglect seem to produce
juvenile delinquency, parental rejection

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other studies further clarify the differential
impact of psychological maltreatment as
compared with other forms of abuse and neglect.
Claussen and Crittenden (1991), in
studying young children averaging 4 years 4
months of age, found that psychological
maltreatment was a better predictor of detrimental
developmental outcomes than the
severity of physical injury and that it usually
co-occurred with physical abuse. They concluded
that this "pervasive co-occurrence
suggest[s] the need to assess systematically
the evidence for psychological maltreatment
for all reported cases of physical maltreatment"
(p. 15). Crittenden et al. (1994), in
studying physical neglect and psychological
maltreatment experiences of children and
adolescents 10 to 17 years of age, found that
severity of psychological abuse was the only
severity scale related to behavior problems.
Vissing et al. (1991), through their national
interview process described earlier, found
that the more parents used verbal aggression,
the more likely their children would be
physically aggressive, delinquent, or experience
interpersonal problems. In addition,
they found that verbal aggression by parents
was more strongly related to these negative
child outcomes than was parental physical
aggression and that physical aggression unaccompanied
by verbal aggression was minimal
in its impact on delinquency and interpersonal
problems. Brown (1984) used a
self-report survey to investigate the relationship
between child maltreatment and juvenile
delinquency. Results indicated that
emotional abuse and neglect, targeted by
questions on spurning, terrorizing, and denying
emotional responsiveness, were correlated
positively with all forms of delinquent
behavior, but physical abuse was not positively
correlated with any form.


Gross and Keller (1992), Briere and
Runtz (1988, 1990), and Rorty, Yager, and
Rossotto (1994) have investigated the maltreatment
histories of adult populations. Respectively,
their findings suggest that psychological
abuse is a stronger predictor than
physical abuse of both depression and low
self-esteem; that psychological maltreatment
bears a special relationship with maladjustment
and is particularly strongly related
to anxiety, depression, interpersonal
sensitivity, dissociation, and low self-esteem;
and that psychological maltreatment is the
most prevalent form of abuse experienced
by bulimics, occurring in more than 4 times
the cases reported for physical abuse.


Main and colleagues (see George &amp;
Main, 1979; Main k Goldwyn, 1984) report
on several studies in which they investigated
the child-rearing experiences of mothers
and their infants. The mother's history of
being rejected by a parent was highly related
to rejection of her own infant, particularly if
the mother displayed cognitive distortions
of idealization of the rejecting parent, difficulty
in remembering childhood, and incoherency
in discussing attachment issues. In
addition, findings indicated that physical
abuse and parental rejection (spurning and
denying emotional responsiveness) produce
quite similar negative effects on children, including
display of unpredictable bouts of aggression
and hostility, unsympathetic and
sometimes violent responses to distress in
others, and self-isolating behaviors.


<b>The Broader Accumulating
Findings Illustrating the
Associates and Effects of
Psychological Maltreatment</b>


A wide range of studies, including many
of those described so far in this chapter,
have identified established or probable effects
of psychological maltreatment within
families. The impact evidence can be
grouped in categories dealing with topics
similar to those originally delineated in the
section on "Serious Emotional Disturbance"
in Public Law 94-142 and now included in
the federal Individuals With Disabilities Act
(i.e., problems with intrapersonal thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors; emotional problem
symptoms; social competency problems and
antisocial functioning; learning problems;
and physical health problems).


Problems with intrapersonal thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors have been found to
be caused by or associated with psychological
maltreatment backgrounds investigated
in research described earlier. The proven or
possible negative effects identified have included
anxiety, depression, low self-esteem,
negative life views, and suicidal ideation
(see Briere &amp; Runtz, 1988, 1990; Claussen &amp;
Crittenden, 1991; Crittenden et al., 1994;
Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987; Gross &amp; Keller,

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emotional problem symptoms have been
well established as being associated with
psychological maltreatment in studies already
identified in this chapter. The problems
identified include emotional instability,
impulse control problems, borderline instability,
unresponsiveness, substance abuse,
and eating disorder problems (see Braver
et al., 1992; Briere &amp; Runtz, 1988;
Crittenden et al., 1994; Egeland &amp; Erickson,
1987; Engels &amp; Moisan, 1994; McCord,
1983; Mullen et al., 1996; Rohner &amp;
Rohner, 1980; Rorty et al., 1994).


Social competency problems and antisocial
functioning, which have been found to
be the probable results of psychological maltreatment
in studies already noted, include
attachment problems, self-is dating behavior,
low social competency, low empathy,
noncompliance, dependency, sexual maladjustment,
aggression and violent behavior,
and delinquency or criminality (see Briere &amp;
Runtz, 1988, 1990; Brown, 1984; Claussen
&amp; Crittenden, 1991; Crittenden et al., 1994;
Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987; Herrenkohl
et al., 1983, 1984, 1991, 1997; Hughes &amp;
Graham-Bermann, 1998; Lefkowitz et al.,
1977; Loeber &amp; Strouthamer-Loeber, 1986;
Main &amp; George, 1985; Main &amp; Goldwyn,
1984; McCord, 1983; Mullen et al., 1996;
Rohner &amp; Rohner 1980; Rorty et al., 1994;
Vissing et al., 1991).


Other studies add support to these relationships.
The Hart and Brassard (1989-1991)
research, which produced operationally
defined measures of emotional maltreatment,
found psychological maltreating behaviors
of mothers to be strongly predictive
of impaired social competence for their children,
as measured by teachers. DeLozier
(1982) found that mothers who physically
assaulted their children were more likely
than controls to have had child histories of
being terrorized by threats of abandonment
and violence (not acts of violence) and to
have been spurned and denied emotional responsiveness.
Dutton and Golant (1995), in
reporting on the results of numerous studies,
found that the recollections of the men
who batter woman were characterized by
memories of cold, rejecting, and abusive fathers.
Numerous other studies have found
psychological maltreatment histories related
to the child victim's aggression, violence, delinquency,
or criminality, indicating that
parents of delinquents tended to be rejecting,
cruel, and less affectionate (Bandura &amp;
Walters, 1959). Children ranked as "most
delinquent" tended to have backgrounds of
rejection (i.e., spurning and denying emotional
responsiveness), whereas parental acceptance
correlated with reduced chance of
delinquency (Nye, 1958).


Numerous studies have shown that parents
of delinquents tend in their discipline to
be physically harsh, inconsistent, unfair,
and nonobjective--in other words, likely to
terrorize and spurn (Button, 1973; Glueck &amp;
Glueck, 1950; Shoemaker, 1984; Trojano
wicz &amp; Morash, 1983). Finally, research has
indicated that a boy is twice as likely to commit
a murder if his background includes being
abused or being reared in a family environment
of criminal violence (Zagar, Arbit,

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Learning problems or child characteristics
likely to interfere with learning associated
with psychological maltreatment back-grounds
and found in studies already eked
include decline in mental competence, lower
measured intelligence, noncompliance, lack
of impulse control, impaired learning, academic
problems and lower achievement
test results, and impaired development of
moral reasoning (see Claussen &amp; Crittenden,
1991; Crittenden et al., 1994; Egeland
&amp; Erickson, 1987; Hughes &amp; Graham-Bermann,
1998; Main &amp; George, 1985;
Main &amp; Goldwyn, 1984; Rohner &amp; Rohner,
1980). Other studies have found rejected
children to do less well than comparison
children on achievement and intelligence
tests (Manley, 1977), do less well in school in
general (Sheintuch &amp; Lewin, 1981; Starkey,
1980), and display impaired development of
moral reasoning (Bilbro, Boni, Johnson, &amp;
Roe, 1979; Hoffman, 1970). Among economically
disadvantaged children, psychologically
maltreated children are significantly
more likely to show school-related
problems in ability and academic achievement
(Hart &amp; Brassard, 1989-1991).


Physical health problems of a variety of
forms have been found to be related to psychological
maltreatment backgrounds, including
rejection (i.e., spurning and denying
emotional responsiveness) and the
psychophysiological problems of allergies
(Miller &amp; Baruch, 1948), asthma and other
respiratory ailments (Jacobs, Spilken, &amp;
Noeman, 1972), and hypertension (McGinn,
1963); spurning, terrorizing, and denying
emotional responsiveness and somatic complaints
(Hughes, 1992; Krugman &amp;
Krugman, 1984); and spurning and high
mortality rates (McCord, 1983). Denying
emotional responsiveness has been found to
be dramatically associated with negative
physical health and development, including
high infant mortality rates (McCord, 1983;
Spitz, 1945, 1946) and developmental delays
in almost all areas of physical and behavioral
development (Bowlby, 1951;
Burlingham &amp; Freud, 1944; Coleman &amp; Provence,
1957; Goldfarb, 1945; Prugh &amp;
Harlow, 1962; Puckering et al., 1995). This
relationship between inadequate emotional
care and indicators of serious growth failure,
despite adequate nutrition, became
known during the 1960s as "nonorganic
failure to thrive." Research on the effects of
child maltreatment on brain development
has reached a much higher level of sophistication
progressed through the use of advanced
technology. Recently reported results
on brain-imaging studies (Joseph,
1999) suggest that severe, repeated sexual
abuse in childhood (which includes psychological
maltreatment, particularly spurning,
terrorizing, isolating, and corrupting/exploiting)
is the probable cause of damage to
the brain structure related to memory and to
significant reductions in the size of the hippocampus,
which may predispose the victim
to develop symptoms of posttraumatic
stress disorder and experience dissociation.
In addition, Moeller et al. (1993) found in a
community sample of 668 women that for
women maltreated in childhood, the greater
the number of types of childhood abuse (including
psychological maltreatment), the
poorer the women's adult health tended to
be.

<b>Theoretical Perspectives</b>

Psychological maltreatment is an extremely
heterogeneous phenomenon, occurring
in a great variety of contexts. As previously
indicated, it embodies many major
and minor categories of acts of commission
and omission that are considered to be damaging
to children. No two cases of psychological
maltreatment will contain the same
elements, and many will be quite different
from others. Most of the major theories in
psychology contain constructs that are
meaningfully related to psychological maltreatment
by the way they describe critical
factors of the developmental process that are
susceptible to the influences of various
kinds of psychological experiences. Theories
of recognized and strong relevance to
psychological maltreatment include human
needs theory, psychosocial theory, attachment
theory, and acceptance-rejection theory.

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Human Needs Theory</b>


Although all humanistic theories have
relevance to child abuse and neglect, human
needs theory has been recognized to have
particularly strong explanatory and heuristic
value for psychological maltreatment
(Barnett, Manly, &amp; Cicchetti, 1991; Binggeli
et al., 2001; Hart et al., 1987; Hart, Brassard,
&amp; Karlson, 1996). Abraham Maslow
(1970), an acknowledged leader in human
needs theory, proposed that the human organism
has certain needs to be met if it is to
develop properly. The first set is the basic
(or deficiency) needs, including physiological
needs (such as food, clothing, and shelter)
and the psychological needs of safety,
love and belongingness, and esteem. The
second set is the growth needs, including
needs for aesthetic and cognitive knowledge
and for what Maslow termed self-actualization.
Self-actualization involves a process of
making more complete use of one's talents
and potentials and of becoming more
self-motivating, self-directive, and <i>self-reinforcing</i>.
If a child is thwarted in his or her
healthy efforts to satisfy the basic needs,
such as love and safety, the child may be
forced to meet these needs in unhealthy
ways, thus distorting development.


The various forms of psychological maltreatment
can be seen as direct attacks on
the basic human needs and as both direct
and indirect attacks on the growth needs.
For example, <i>spurning</i> would be in conflict
with the needs for belongingness, love, and
esteem. <i>Terrorizing</i> could affect each of these
needs and seriously compromise a child's
safety needs.


<b>Psychosocial Stage Theory</b>


Erik Erikson (1959) proposed that human
development proceeds in the following
series of stages, each with its own set tasks
or conflicts:
<blockquote>
<p>
infancy--trust versus mistrust (emphasis years
0-2) and autonomy versus shame and
doubt (emphasis years 2-4),
</p>
<p>
childhood--initiative versus guilt (emphasis
years 5-7) and industry versus inferiority
(emphasis 8-12),
</p>
<p>
adolescence--identity versus identity confusion
(emphasis years 13-17).
</p>
</blockquote>
Each stage is seen as having its own period of
ascendancy, although the tasks of each stage
are present to some degree in preceding and
later stages. The degree of success or failure
an individual achieves at each stage is seen as
affecting the quality and likelihood of success
and failure at subsequent stages. Psychological
maltreatment can be viewed as
undermining the individual's efforts to successfully
master the tasks of a developmental
stage. Poor resolution at a previous stage can
have direct effects on the individual's ability
to successfully complete the tasks of later
stages. For example, infants who are psychologically
neglected (denied emotional responsiveness)
or terrorized through direct
assaults or chaotic and stressful surrounding
interpersonal environments are likely to develop
a basic sense of mistrust that will limit
and distort their exploratory behavior and
thwart development of a healthy autonomy.
Without correction, this can erode a sense of
self and a sense of self-worth and ultimately
prevent the development of a strong sense of
identity. Psychosocial stage theory has been
used to clarify the influence of psychological
maltreatment at different developmental
points in children's lives (Cicchetti &amp;
Braunwald, 1984; Sroufe, 1996, 1979).


infancy--trust versus mistrust (emphasis years
0-2) and autonomy versus shame and
doubt (emphasis years 2-4),


childhood--initiative versus guilt (emphasis
years 5-7) and industry versus inferiority
(emphasis 8-12),


adolescence--identity versus identity confusion
(emphasis years 13-17).


<b>Attachment Theory</b>


The human infant enters the world programmed
with a set of behaviors designed
to elicit appropriate caregiving, according to
attachment theory (Ainsworth, 1969, 1989;
Bowlby, 1973, 1980, 1982, 1988; Sroufe,
1979). Between 6 to 12 months of age, the infant
begins forming attachments with one or
a few individuals. The development of a secure
attachment with a primary caregiver is
the stage-salient task during this period. It is
theorized that the quality of the attachment
attained during these early stages affects
subsequent attachment behavior. A growing
body of evidence strongly suggests that the
quality of attachment has profound implications
for emotional health and interpersonal
functioning. Two key ideas of attachment
theory are the ideas of a "secure base" and
"internal working models." It is thought that
a secure attachment with a responsive care-taker

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Extensive research has been conducted
on attachment issues (Ainsworth, Blehar,
Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978; Belsky, Rovine, &amp;
Taylor, 1984; Crittenden &amp; Ainsworth,
1989; Goldberg, Perrota, Minde, &amp; Corter,
1986; Grossman &amp; Grossman, 1985; Main,
1996; Pearce &amp; Pezzot-Pearce, 1994). Infant
attachment patterns have been found to be
systematically related to specific patterns of
maternal caretaking behavior. Four attachment
patterns have been identified: secure
attachment, ambivalent-resistant attachment,
avoidant attachment, and disorganized-disoriented
attachment. Infants who
display ambivalent-resistant attachment appear
to have experienced inconsistent and
insensitive care, which fits the denying emotional
responsiveness category of psychological
maltreatment. Avoidant attachment
infants appear to have experienced insensitive
caregiving, which alternates between rejecting,
neglecting, and interfering and fits
the spurning, denying emotional responsiveness,
and exploiting/corrupting forms of
psychological maltreatment. Disorganized-disoriented
attachment infants appear to
have experienced a confusing pattern of
early consistent care and later inconsistent
care that may include characteristics of
spurning, terrorizing, isolating, and denying
emotional responsiveness.


<b>Parental
Acceptance-Rejection Theory</b>


This theoretical orientation was specifically
developed by Rohner and Rohner
(1980) to clarify the nature of "emotional
maltreatment" and to guide cross-cultural
research on rejection. In their theory, "acceptance"
means parental warmth and affection,
and "rejection" means emotional abuse
that is embodied, principally, in parental
hostility and aggression and parental indifference
and neglect. These two forms of rejection
are basically the equivalents of
spurning and denying emotional responsiveness
(see earlier section for the impact of
rejection).


<b>Additional Relevant Theories</b>


The coercion model (Patterson, 1982,
1986) indicates that interpersonal relations
problems frequently occur through a pattern
of escalating negative interactions between
persons, such that the negative action
of one person stimulates a negative response
by the other person, which stimulates another,
possibly more severe, negative response
by the first person, and so on. Many
of the negative actions and responses would
fall within psychological maltreatment categories.


The prisoner-of-war model contrasts the
state of the child who experiences extended
intrafamilial child abuse with that of the
adult prisoner of war. It posits that a child
victim of abuse may have greater vulnerability
to harm because maltreatment occurs
during critical developmental periods. It
also recognizes that the influences of psychological
maltreatment on the child may be
strengthened due to the child (a) being discouraged
from blaming adult perpetrators,
(b) being encouraged to blame self, (c) having
a relatively limited background of positive
life experiences to ameliorate the experience,
and (d) having a relatively limited
ability to place the experience in a larger
context of time and successful problem resolution
to provide hope of and perseverance
for respite (Benedek, 1985; Turgi &amp; Hart,
1988).

<b>Psychological Maltreatment and the Law</b>

Psychological maltreatment (even at severe
levels), when it has been unconnected
to or not accompanied by physical abuse,
sexual abuse, or serious neglect of a child's
basic needs (e.g., food, clothing, shelter, education,
health care), has rarely led to coercive
or punitive governmental intervention
--either by CPS agencies or the courts.
Few reported appellate court decisions reviewing
trial-level child protective judicial
intervention actions address cases in which
psychological maltreatment alone was the
basis for a lower court's judgment. This
makes it extremely difficult to identify or describe
any general controlling judicial precedents
to guide court actions in emotional or
mental injury cases. As described below, the
relevant language contained in the state's

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The training that CPS workers, police,
prosecutors, judges, and other professionals
receive on the topic of child maltreatment
focuses almost entirely on identifying and
proving physical abuse, sexual abuse, or the
tangible aspects of child neglect. The documentation
of children's mental injuries related
to psychological maltreatment has, regrettably,
never been an important focus of
professional training for those with legal responsibilities
to intervene in cases of serious
harm to children. Previously, there has not
been an accepted and widely used set of specific
"psychological maltreatment guidelines"
designed for legal system professionals
to either assess harm or make
intervention decisions.


However, for more than 25 years, states
receiving federal funding under the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act have
been required to include, within their
laws, statutory language that incorporates
the concept of "mental injury" within overall
definitions of child abuse and neglect.
This mental injury terminology has
proven difficult for many state legislatures to
define.


Some laws simply use the term <i>mental injury</i>
(or some similar term) without any further
explanation. Other state laws include a
description of psychological maltreatment
that incorporates one or more of the following
legal requirements or aspects.


Some laws mandate that the child has suffered
a serious psychological or emotional
injury (or, in some states, merely a substantial
threat of such an injury), caused by either
overt acts (Minnesota adds that acts
must be consistently and deliberately inflicted;
Minn. Stat. Ann. § 260C.007) or
omissions in care by a parent or other person
responsible for the child's care.


Some states require that the child's injuries
be evidenced by observable, substantial,
sustained (either over a short term or long
term), and identifiable impairments of the
child's intellectual or psychological capacity
or emotional stability (again, some laws permit
intervention for a substantial "risk" of
such impairment). Stated another way, these
laws require that the "impairments" affect
the child's ability to function in a developmentally
appropriate manner or within a
"normal range" of performance or behavior,
with some states further requiring that the
child's age, development, culture, and environment
be taken into consideration.


Some laws use vague terms such as <i>failure
to provide</i> for a child's "mental or emotional
needs." Some laws use the term <i>emotional</i> or
<i>psychological</i> abuse or injury, but most do not.


Some states focus on the child's problem-related
symptoms to include evidence
of the child's severe anxiety/agitation, depression,
withdrawal, untoward aggressive
behavior (toward self or others), seriously
delayed development, psychosis, or similarly
serious dysfunctional behavior. (Note:
some state laws would permit intervention
even if the parent's actions or omissions
were not the <i>cause</i> of the child's problems but
if the parent refused appropriate treatment
for the child, really a form of "medical neglect.")


Some laws explicitly require that the
above impairments or symptoms be supported
by the opinion of an expert witness
(e.g., a licensed physician or qualified mental
health professional).


Several states take a different approach to
defining <i>impairment</i> of emotional health/mental
or emotional capacity to include a child's
substantially diminished psychological or
intellectual functioning in relation but not
limited to factors such as failure to thrive
(specifically mentioned in several state
laws), control of aggressive or self-destructive
impulses, ability to think and reason, or
acting out or misbehavior, including incorrigibility,
ungovernability, or habitual truancy,
but only when the impairments are
clearly attributable to the unwillingness or
inability of the parent or caretaker to exercise
a minimum degree of care toward the
child.


A few state laws take unique approaches
toward defining psychological maltreatment.
Florida specifically recognizes <i>isolation</i>
as a form of psychological maltreatment by
including in the definition of <i>harm</i> the use of
mechanical devices, unreasonable restraints,
or extended periods of isolation to
control a child (Fl. Stat. Ann. § 39.01); Hawaii
includes evidence of the child's suffering
"extreme mental distress" or "gross degradation"
among its specifically enumerated
categories of child maltreatment (Haw. Rev.
Stat. § 350-1); Minnesota includes, as a defense
in emotional maltreatment cases, that
the parent or caretaker used a reasonable exercise
of authority or used reasonable training
and discipline (Minn. Stat. Ann. §
260C.007 Subd.8); and Vermont has a definition
of emotional maltreatment that requires

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One area of psychological maltreatment
not yet incorporated into state laws but
clearly affecting potential CPS agency mental
injury-related actions involves situations
in which children are exposed to domestic
violence in the home but are not the direct
victims of abuse themselves (see Chapter 6,
this volume). There is increasing recognition
that children who live in chronically violent
homes can suffer great emotional
harm, and we will likely see legislatures and
child welfare agencies struggle to set proper
limits on when intervention can occur on
behalf of such <i>violence-exposed</i> children.


There are major legal concerns about
classifying children exposed to domestic violence
as per se victims of child maltreatment
(not the least of which are the implications
of having such a huge number of
children who are so exposed become the focus
of an already overburdened CPS system).
Recently, California has taken an aggressive
posture to work toward identifying
and serving domestic violence-exposed children
as abused. The experience of witnessing
domestic violence was included as the
first item in the "Emotional Abuse Decision
Tree" of <i>California's Child Welfare Services
Structured Decision Making Pilot Project</i> (Domestic
Violence Unit, 1999). These developments
followed the findings of <i>In re Heather
A</i>. (1996), in which children were removed
from their fathers' custody based on findings
that "the minors were periodically exposed
to violent confrontations between the
father and the minors' stepmother that endangered
their physical and emotional
safety." These developments in California
should be followed carefully to determine
their implications for protecting children
from psychological maltreatment. The
question of government intervention in
homes where children have witnessed or
otherwise been affected by the domestic
violence committed against a parent will
undoubtedly continue to be debated among
professionals and the public, and mental
health professionals with expertise on this
topic should be involved in these policy discussions.


In conclusion, despite all the potential
statutory variations (and controversies) in
approaching legal intervention due to emotional
harm inflicted on children by their
parents, there is no reason to believe that
when evidence of psychological maltreatment
and its serious impact on a child is
clearly presented to the court, there cannot
be active and appropriate judicial and CPS
agency efforts to both protect the child from
such continued harm and provide mental
health services to the child to ameliorate the
harm.


It is particularly important for child welfare
agency attorneys and juvenile court
judges to receive education on the devastating
effects on children of severe psychological
maltreatment and why governmental intervention
in these situations is important.
CPS workers need practice-friendly guidelines
for identifying cases of severe psychological
maltreatment that warrant referral
for possible judicial action. Given the continued
focus of training on legal proof in the
(more common) child sexual abuse and severe
physical abuse cases, it is critical that
psychologists and psychiatrists educate the
bar and bench on the magnitude and
long-term impact of parentally inflicted
mental injuries to children, as well as on the
likely prognosis for various child treatment
interventions when children have suffered
severe emotional harm. The APSAC (1995)
practice guidelines provides a base that has
the potential to be quite useful in the education
and practice of the social service and legal
professions' handling of psychological
maltreatment cases.

<b>Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment</b>

The major challenge in assessing psychological
maltreatment is answering the difficult
question, "When does inadequate or
poor parenting cross the line into psychological
maltreatment?" Caregiver behavior is
judged to be psychological maltreatment if
one instance is highly likely to produce or
has produced mental or developmental

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Psychological maltreatment is identified
through applying its definitions and descriptions
as found in Table 4.1 and in relevant
state laws to direct observations and reports
of caregiver behavior by others. Some states
also require that the caregiver's maltreating
behavior has emotionally or mentally
harmed a child. <i>Harm</i> means that there is
clear evidence of related mental injuries (severe
emotional disturbance under the federal
Individuals With Disabilities Act or the
<i>DSM-W</i> [American Psychiatric Association,
1994]) or developmental harm (one or more
areas of mastery have not occurred or have
occurred in a strongly distorted manner; see
Table 4.2).


The <i>Guidelines for the Psychosocial Evaluation
of Suspected Psychological Maltreatment in
Children and Adolescents</i> (APSAC, 1995) offer
a framework for professionals evaluating
children to determine whether they have
been or are presently victims of psychological
maltreatment. The guidelines were designed
to assist in case planning, legal decision
making, and treatment planning for
psychological maltreatment that occurs in
isolation as well as in conjunction with other
forms of abuse and neglect. Because psychological
maltreatment is often accompanied
by or embedded in other forms of child
abuse and neglect, its presence should be assessed
when professionals are evaluating
possible physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect,
as well as when addressing family
problems related to such maltreatment (e.g.,
initiating family therapy or beginning judicial
intervention). Because many state laws
require evidence of both acts of maltreatment
and harm that have either occurred or
are predicted to occur to make a case determination,
the guidelines deal with both the
assessment of maltreatment acts and of
harm.


Psychological maltreatment consists of
messages a child receives about himself or
herself from important others in the social
environment; therefore, professionals should
observe the caregiver suspected of psychological
maltreatment and the alleged child
victim interacting over several occasions.
Assessors may use the APSAC categories of
psychological maltreatment to organize
their observations and the reports of others
familiar with the child-caregiver relationship.
If a case involves younger children
they might also use one of the observational
measures developed by researchers to help
them screen, organize information, and

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I005&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Although direct observation is desirable,
it is not always necessary to form an opinion
regarding whether psychological maltreatment
has occurred. Other methods for assessing
the child-caregiver relationship exist.
These include interviews with the caregiver
and the child (if old enough), review of pertinent
records, consultation with other professionals,
and collateral reports from siblings,
grandparents, school and day care personnel,
neighbors, and others. A suggested set
of questions to ask these individuals is provided
in Table 4.3.


Two screening measures, the Conflict
Tactic Scales Parent-Child Form (Straus,
Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996;
Straus, Hamby, Finkelhor, Moore, &amp;
Runyan, 1998) and the Record of Maltreatment
Experiences (McGee, Wolfe, &amp; Wilson,
1990; Wolfe &amp; McGee, 1994), could be
used with parents, other knowledgeable
adults, and older children.


For the evaluator preparing forensic testimony,
it will be important to document as
precisely as possible the incidents of psychological
maltreatment that have been observed,
are present in the record, or were reported
by others. Evaluators will want to assess
harm by conducting a thorough developmental
assessment (a) through
observation of child behavior, teacher interview/ratings,
record review, and assessment
of child or adolescent intellectual, academic,
personality, and interpersonal functioning
and moral development and (b) through the
use of structured interviews with the child
(if old enough) and informed others. In
some cases, there is no evidence of harm.
This does not mean that maltreatment has
had or will have no effect. It may mean that
the child has been able to cope with the developmental
challenges experienced at a
cost not easily recognized or detected. This
may not hold true in the future. Evaluators
should assess the likelihood of eventual
harm through application of the research literature
on child maltreatment and developmental
and clinical psychology, psychiatry,
and social work toward the goal of developing
a coherent, empirically supported argument
on the relationship between parental
acts and child outcomes.

<b>Interventions With Child Victims and Maltreating Families</b>

In the 30 years since Kempe and his colleagues
identified the battered child syndrome,
clinicians and scholars have learned
a great deal about the psychological impact
of all forms of maltreatment, including psychological
abuse and neglect, on children's
emotional, social, and behavioral functioning
(Kempe, Silverman, Steele, Droegemuller,

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The prevention of child maltreatment is
clearly the top intervention priority. Prevention
is discussed in detail in Chapter 21. For
a recent review of the status of intervention
efforts targeting psychological maltreatment
in families, see Binggeli et al. (2001).


Studies of specific treatments for maltreated
children are uncommon (Azar &amp;
Wolfe, 1998; Williams, 1983) despite compelling
reasons to treat children. First and
foremost is the ethical imperative: Providing
therapeutic treatment for children who suffer
mistreatment and trauma has been
raised to the level of a universal imperative
through the standards of the United Nations
(UN) Convention on the Rights of the
Child (see particularly article 39; United
Nations General Assembly, 1989). Second,
the evaluation of treatment programs indicates
that children evidence far greater treatment
gains than do maltreating adults
(Daro, 1988). Yet another reason to target
children for treatment is indisputable evidence
of the intergenerarional transmission
of child maltreatment (Egeland, Jacobvitz, &amp;
Sroufe, 1988; Kaufman &amp; Zigler, 1987;
Youngblade &amp; Belsky, 1990).


Treatment of children that provides trusting
compensatory relationships, which
model mutual respect and teach the behavioral
skills necessary to relate to others, can
not only ameliorate the psychosocial problems
experienced by abused children but
can also serve to truncate this intergenerational
cycle of abuse (Youngblade &amp; Belsky,
1990). Preschool and elementary schools
can serve as important settings for both the
prevention and treatment of psychological
abuse and neglect. Preschool and elementary
school teachers can serve as secure attachment
figures for children and, at the
same time, model appropriate child care
skills for parents (see Crittenden, 1988;
Pavenstedt, 1967; Sroufe, 1983) and, with
peers, shape appropriate skills in children
(Davis &amp; Fantuzzo, 1989), thereby reducing
aggression and social withdrawal. For older
children and adolescents, group treatment
and personal skill development classes have
been recognized as important contexts in
which to resolve relationship conflicts and
develop social skills (Daro, 1988; Pittman,
Wolfe, &amp; Wekerle, 1998; Wolfe, et al., 1996).
Research on the effectiveness of these programs
is promising. School-based interventions
that support the social and academic
development of these children are as important
as other treatments. Schools that give
at-risk students a sense of competence
through successful experience in academics,
art, music, athletics, or social interaction
and that teach them to plan and make conscious
choices about important events in
their lives have significantly better student
outcomes than those that do not (Rutter &amp;
Rutter, 1993). This is an important area for
future research.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Psychological maltreatment takes five
forms -- spurning, terrorizing, isolating, corrupting/
exploiting, and denying emotional
responsiveness -- each of which can occur in
isolation but more often occur in combination
with other forms of maltreatment. Psychological
maltreatment has been posited as
the unifying concept in child abuse and neglect.

Knowledge about psychological maltreatment
has expanded substantially during
the past 20 years. Widely supported definitions
have been established for the five
basic forms of psychological maltreatment.
The nature and extent of the problem have
been clarified, producing credible evidence
that psychological maltreatment produces
devastating and long-lasting negative effects.
Psychological maltreatment appears to
be the most pervasive form of maltreatment,
with approximately one third of the adult
population having experienced it in childhood
and 10% to 15% of all persons having
experienced psychological maltreatment in
its more severe and chronic forms.


Expert and lay opinion agree that psychological
maltreatment is a recognizable
and serious condition deserving attention.
Although more research is needed, especially
with regard to the interactions among
various forms of maltreatment, enough is
known to warrant renewed attention to legal
policies and practices regarding psychological
maltreatment.
