BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Do they lock the doors downstairs at 5. 
THERAPIST: I think they often do, yeah. Do you not have the code?
CLIENT: Mm mm.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay. Um, let me give you the code. I'm sorry. 
CLIENT: That's okay. 
THERAPIST: I assumed I had. It's # [code]. 
CLIENT: Um...one second. (pause) Um # [code]. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Okay. 
THERAPIST: Um, and do you usually take the elevator?
CLIENT: Uh huh. 
THERAPIST: Cuz there's also a code in the elevator. 
CLIENT: Oh. 
THERAPIST: Or have you not run into that?
CLIENT: I always have to go down to the basement. It'll take you down to the basement but won't let you out on the first floor without a code. 
THERAPIST: On the way in you go down to the basement and get the...
CLIENT: No, um, so this is the first time I've actually been locked out on the way in. 
THERAPIST: Okay. 
CLIENT: But on the way out, the elevator always takes me to the basement...
THERAPIST: Okay. 
CLIENT: ...instead of the lobby. 
THERAPIST: Alright. Um...I usually don't do the elevator. But I think I...I think I know what the codes are. 
CLIENT: Okay. [0:01:26.5]
THERAPIST: I think it's [code] #. 
CLIENT: (writing) okay. 
THERAPIST: Um, it's possible it's also #[code] or #[code]#.
CLIENT: Right, something like that. 
THERAPIST: But it's some type of...I think it's [code]#, sort of opposite of the door. 
CLIENT: Okay, I will give that a try. 
THERAPIST: Okay. And if that doesn't work let me know and I'll ask one of my colleagues cuz one is the elevator and one is...
CLIENT: Okay. (pause) (sighs) Okay. Um, (pause) (inaudible at 00:02:17].5) be (sighs) I think it's because I'm having a...I was having a not a great day. And after reading a (inaudible at 00:02:29].6) in our office I was trying to do something, um (pause) and I felt like super stressed and just like I don't know I couldn't...I felt like I couldn't cope with doing anything. So I did what I usually don't do at work, which is I took a Valium to see if that would like ease everything out...which it did. Um, because I don't take it during the work day it was very weird. Like usually I've taken it when I'm at home lying down or some other (inaudible at 00:03:12].0). Um, really, really I felt like probably disconnected from like emotions and feelings for the rest of the day. Which, I mean, I'm sort of attributing to Valium but it might just have been me (inaudible at 00:03:33].2). It was really odd, not (pause) it was definitely not enjoyable. Like I finished the work day. I didn't freak out during my afternoon meeting or someone's being on my case about quickly selling software. So that was good. Um, but like I'm home. I said mmm...I don't really feel like eating cuz I was watching TV and I was, (inaudible at 00:04:09].0) I don't watch this show. Because she's obsessed with Breaking Bad.
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And I was just like mmm...can't really concentrate on anything else and (inaudible at 00:04:20].1) so I was like mmm, can't go there. Ashby kind of putting me in her bedroom and saying sit on the bed. Alright. Like I read my book and I was playing with the cat but I don't know. I just felt sort of like slightly like next to myself doing that. 
THERAPIST: Uh huh. [0:04:42.0]
CLIENT: Like it was really, really flat. 
THERAPIST: And this doesn't usually go one with taking Valium?
CLIENT: Usually I just fall asleep or usually I'm so upset that I either just sort of lie still and stare at the ceiling, or I fall asleep. Or I kind of lie on the sofa and listen to like a documentary or something. Um, I usually don't probably do anything. Um, there hasn't been before where I haven't wanted to eat. Um, or that I haven't wanted to make a decision about what to eat, that I don't feel very hungry. Which is also really weird. Um, it just made for a very strange evening that I didn't like. But I also like half the time was just going mmm...this is weird. I should probably care about it, but I don't. Um, so I was even kind like out of it when friends of mine brought me over (inaudible at 00:05:56].1), which was a new thing. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Um, and like while that was amazing, really awesome and exciting it was still kind of like ohh, ya know and um I didn't realize (inaudible [00:06:14].7) I thought it was is that how it feels, really different from sort of trying to avoid like being upset? 
THERAPIST: Uh huh. 
CLIENT: Um, and I've been talking to my friends about sort of avoiding and repressing difficult emotions cuz you didn't want to have them. Um, and I was like well, yeah but I feel like I kind of know that I'm still upset. Like even if I'm sort of busy. Like no, actually I'm not upset or (inaudible at 00:07:01].2) other things. Like I still knew that something was going on. 
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [0:07:07.8]
CLIENT: Well, with this it was just like, I don't know...such a weird disconnect. Um, and also like not how I felt taking any other psychiatric medication. And thought this was sort of really divorced. I mean I think just taking Valium in my bed is probably something I'm going to stick to, because that whole evening was so weird and the day was weird and uh...
THERAPIST: And it may have had more to do with the Valium and with just being upset. 
CLIENT: I think it was kind of a combination. Like it made it easier to sort of like disconnect from how I felt and just stay disconnected from my (inaudible [00:08:16].7). Um, though sometimes when I feel really disconnected from my body or from how I feel it's usually not super....like it doesn't last a very long time. Um, and this was, ya know, kind of half a day. (pause) Um, the other thing which I couldn't...I don't remember if I actually mentioned this or not, um so when I got home I was talking to Ashby about um (inaudible at 00:09:03].2) and this whole thing...
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: ...and she had seen that it happened (inaudible at 00:09:10].0) whatever. Um, and so her first response was like well, you know, you were kind of aggressive and this person didn't like, ya know...you don't know you and like this whole thing like maybe you shouldn't have come out swinging that hard or without context and (pause)...I know but I was thinking...what I was thinking about was so you know, let's say a dozen or so friends, probably (inaudible at 00:09:49].5) and that wasn't anything. Like it was not even a hey, that was kind of weird having your (inaudible at 00:10:06].7) in a while or like oh! Like, like sort of just dead silence. Um, and then the nondead silence was Ashby telling me that I should have been nicer. I should have strategize more. I should have planned thing. Um, and I think that's one of the things that was really upsetting (inaudible at 00:10:35].0) is that like how I might feel about this, whether I might feel kind of out of it or I might feel sad or upset or angry. Like, it's happened and I cared. It's just that no one said anything. I mean it was like silence so like who knows. 
THERAPIST: Yes. 
CLIENT: But, it felt really...it felt like (inaudible at 00:11:08].0) and it felt like...I don't know for some reason Ashby talking to me about how I should have faced things when I got home just made me really feel like yeah! Ya know what? So usually I saw that and other people like you sort of like had this weight. How come everyone saw that and didn't say anything? Especially since because social media and like attention with friends like it's not uncommon for um like someone to e-mail about something...like oh, I saw that on Facebook or Twitter or on a blog, whatever, and it was really sucky. Like there's often cross chat. Um...
THERAPIST: Sure. 
CLIENT: Ya know. 
THERAPIST: That's just the kind of (inaudible at 00:12:12].5) talk about, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Oh yeah. Like I mean among other things um like Jen um, like I can't stand her, which a lot of people, a lot of my friends know, and so there's kind of that and like I don't know, like random people, random of my friends will also sort of like pop off about something and so I'm like oh! I see that, you know could just...I don't know...(inaudible at 00:12:55].8) a lot and it was odd to have a like minor dust up with someone and have no one say anything. Like even a what the hell, were you really grumpy? Ya know. (pause) And I think what I kind of wanted was someone to (inaudible at 00:13:28].4)...I really wanted someone to say that wow, he was really kind of a jerk. Um, or uhh, it's kinda, that's annoying. And if (inaudible at 00:13:41].4) and a couple friends of mine and my (inaudible at 00:13:47].5) partner shared it and they were all like wow! I mean they were like after sort of me (inaudible at 00:13:53].0) they were like gosh, she's a jerk. I can't stand her. But I don't know. I didn't want to have to do that part. Like (sighs)...like reaching out to kind of...
THERAPIST: You were kind of (inaudible at 00:14:15].3) and mad that friends didn't chime in on your side. I don't mean to her. I just mean supported you. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Like or something. Um, like not even necessarily like chiming in like support. Just kind of like a hey! What's up? Hello. Sort of having a rough day people. Um (pause) And so one of my friends had said that um, (inaudible at 00:15:15].6) she's like oh, you had so many people commenting on it (inaudible at 00:15:16].7) you find depressed, like obviously you have a lot of people supporting you. And I was like mmm...I just think the numbers are irrelevant. Like um (pause) having a lot of followers or commenters doesn't...I don't know. The number doesn't really do anything for me. Like I don't...I don't really care. Like I want my friends to read what I'm saying but kind of beyond that I'm like stuff, like people reading it. Like most of the...instead of talking Internet I (inaudible at 00:16:14].8) (pause). It's kind a metaphor for like people who vaguely know me and like sometimes I might write something that's like for, like a public audience or a wider audience, but generally (inaudible at 00:16:27].1) probably two years or so. Um, so (inaudible at 00:16:38].3) I'd be like wow, I have a lot of followers on Twitter and I know a lot of them. Like a lot of my friends are here. What the fuck. Like where were you in this time of upset, aggravation and Twitter stupidity. Except that's not really Twitter, it's like (pause) I mean it's not like I'm having (inaudible at 00:17:03].6) beef with Jen due to like Twitter, follow her accounts (inaudible at 00:17:10].7). No, this is an actual thing. (pause) [0:18:13.4]
THERAPIST: Um, (pause) I guess I have a couple of thoughts. I mean (pause) I'm wondering if I get sort of feel you're saying you feel like um (pause) sounds like it was (inaudible at 00:19:08].3) in a way that people no matter (inaudible at 00:19:13].9) in the ways that matter. Which (pause) I imagine is upsetting, angering, feel isolated. Is that right so far?
CLIENT: Mm hmm. [0:19:40.3]
THERAPIST: But, I don't know what bearings this has on what kind of like you're talking about, but I just (inaudible at 00:19:56].9). You also do this thing where like you kind of show rather than tell when it comes to things like this a lot. Ya know like (pause) I'm gonna say it's hard to pick up how you're feeling from what you say, but I do feel like it's, it's almost the way an author would like (inaudible at 00:20:26].8)...
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: ...to um sort of (inaudible [00:20:32].2) of like generating the feelings for the reader that the author had in the situation. (pause) 
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean...
THERAPIST: I don't think you sort of plan...think about doing it that way. 
CLIENT: No, like I don't.
THERAPIST: And I think it's not as though like it's that obscure you know what you're feeling but I guess it's not, it's not evident in your affect as you say the stuff. In other words you don't sound frustrated or upset. I mean I get that you are. Again what I hear you say that there's, yeah I'm not sure what to make of that, but it strikes me. I guess what I do make of that is (pause) I think it may um (pause) it may be a way of communicating what you're feeling that doesn't put you in a position that's as vulnerable if you communicated it more explicitly. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I feel like (pause) (inaudible at 00:22:25].7) that I say I'm feeling X and the next question will be but why? And that why not meaning my God, what happened today? But, ya know, just if I or...just by yourself. Um...(pause) 
THERAPIST: Um (pause) what I guess in a way (inaudible at 00:23:44].7) how (pause) uh (pause) caring and maybe unhelpful. (inaudible at 00:24:07].8) to talk about what things are like for you. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean one of the...one of the things I was thinking about was also like (sighs)...I don't know. Like (sighs) I guess sort of like being like uh...I mean the (inaudible at 00:24:50].9) um, which is like I remember (inaudible at 00:24:59].1) will always have to work harder and like dress like more conservative and blah, blah, blah, and also (inaudible at 00:25:10].5) take out all the drag queens and (inaudible at 00:25:11].9) people. It's like they're just like in our house. Um, so that is basically, ya know, how my friends raised me to be. Like (inaudible at 00:25:33].6) when I was younger. Definitely (inaudible at 00:25:38].7) when I was like in middle school, high school, college. Like (inaudible at 00:25:46].7) matters. Like that's just not what matters, how people perceive you but also you know it's like not, like not raising your voice, not being visibly angry or upset. Um, (inaudible at 00:26:09].6) will be okay but like not I guess expressing (inaudible at 00:26:15].9) or anything that could be negative. (inaudible at 00:26:22].6) Um, so it's hard not to...I mean I'm often surprised that people are able to be um...not surprised is the word, um (inaudible at 00:26:50].6) when people are like super emotional and sort of like (inaudible at 00:26:59].7) where I don't, like...I don't know. It just seem like really (inaudible at 00:27:09].9) so like that I don't feel they really miss vulnerable and not inappropriate but I guess...I still could have done something that I shouldn't do. Um, and there would be negative repercussions if I did. And so that it's hard to get over um...it's also with Josie (sighs). Although she would be very emotional, she didn't like me to be. I think she would get upset. Um, and also like you know more towards the end of our relationship (sighs) if I got...I was upset or angry she would often like kind of one-up me on it or like well, you being upset made me upset, or you saying that has just triggered a flashback, or you so...or like we couldn't talk because I was being too angry or too aggressive or too violent or whatever, so tried to talk to her. Probably the only way I could really talk to her is if I was...if I tried to say things as neutral as possible. Um, and also it felt like she was really upset and I was really upset about something that her upset mattered more or was more (sighs) I guess more of an immediate problem. Um, because her being very upset, ya know, there was a likelihood that she would like have a flashback or something else and says I'm leaving. But she doesn't even know where we were. Or completely checking out of everything and just (pause)...I don't know. Like it sort of ended with whatever reaction we were having. The other thing which I (inaudible at 00:30:39].0) but one of Josie's big things was using the free self-care to justify...everything. Like really selfish behavior. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, certainly the way you're describing her like having a flashback any time anybody feels a way she doesn't like because it's bullshit (inaudible at 00:31:00].7) 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. [0:31:03.0]
CLIENT: Um, so like (inaudible [00:31:08].1) and she was like well, I can't do this because I need to engage in self-care. And I can't go to the grocery store. I can't...I need you to walk with me somewhere or just like...
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: ...(inaudible at 00:31:24].3) of everything that she did, and I still (inaudible at 00:31:32].4) when someone talks about self-care. Um, and I could have punched some mutual friends of ours who I saw or something with (inaudible at 00:31:46].3) I really hate that word self-care now. Like it's hard to hear that and not think you're being a selfish, horrible person. Um, I think that's one of the things that can make me feel stressed out doing therapy more frequently because it feels like is this the...I don't know. If it's still like kind of like back of the mind, is this is the beginning of like narcissistic, selfish horribleness. Um, and even though I can (inaudible at 00:32:33].2) right now, I'm pretty sure (inaudible at 00:32:33].8) it's still like, like that's what self-care reminds me of. Like self-care reminds basically of Josie being really demanding and selfish and horrible and me having to sort of like (inaudible at 00:32:54].8), give up whatever I was doing or feeling to pay attention to her. So (pause) I try not to think like no, that's not what we're doing and that's not what we're talking about, but it always comes up. 
THERAPIST: Huh. (pause) Yeah, I think what you're describing, all these things are reasons why...hopefully reasons why it's dangerous to (inaudible at 00:34:28].8) 
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean I think one of the things about being explicit about how I feel is that (sighs) like I'm scared that someone will...I'm scared things (inaudible at 00:34:48].1) or shot down or (sighs) like having someone (inaudible at 00:34:53].7) talking to you like focus on like something that's not important or like not really relevant to what I'm talking about. 
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: And (inaudible at 00:35:04].1) or like focused on (inaudible at 00:35:04].8) and like I don't really care about that part. The part that I care about is the part where I was really scared. I was really angry. 
THERAPIST: Or where that you're talking about something that happens pretty generally for you. Um, but as it's also I think something that pertains here, I wonder about your sort of worries and/or like bad experiences with that with me. (pause) 
CLIENT: I don't know. It sort of feels like a (inaudible [00:35:04].8). Like they don't want to do. Um, also (inaudible at 00:36:25].6). Um, and I guess it, it doesn't really matter that you have it (inaudible at 00:36:38].1). It still feels like it's a possibility. Um, and also (inaudible at 00:36:52].0) there are also things that are um (inaudible at 00:36:59].6) that are ritualized or sexualized or (inaudible at 00:37:02].1) that, um I'm really used to like 99 percent of the time getting a negative reaction. So it's really hard to like oh not at this time. She'd say fine. Um, and I think that (sighs)...I think this is where I feel more (inaudible at 00:37:31].7) or also this is where I particularly want to like describe or show not tell because...I mean just because it's so many times having people say but no, but like having had so many arguments...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: ...about that.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: And I don't know. It just feels like easier to just say alright. It's gonna be another like...I don't even think about it most of the time. It's just sort of like that's how we've been talking about it. 
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: And it's a surprise when I don't have to sort of I guess lay the groundwork (inaudible at 00:38:23].7) (pause) 
THERAPIST: It sounds like that my understanding is not because I'm saying bad, or you shouldn't do it but because it seems to me to indicate that you're really anxious, which I think is what you're explaining the reasons for, some of the reasons for now. Um, I guess I just wanted to be clear I wasn't (pause) (inaudible at 00:39:00].6). Only that it can (inaudible at 00:39:11].5) reflect, you know, like vulnerable and afraid. Um, clearly (inaudible at 00:39:29].3) but also (pause) I think in ways that you're probably partly or just not terribly aware of—I don't mean you don't know how you've been burned—like you could clarify a lot of that I think—but that this is a pretty reflexive way of reacting to worries about that I think. 
CLIENT: No, I think it is. I don't know. I mean (inaudible at 00:40:18].9) think about is how, uh, (inaudible at 00:40:28].5) response to compliments (inaudible at 00:40:31].4).
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: Um, and I think that (inaudible at 00:40:32].4) I'm just gonna say thing and then just say thank you. And I still most like...I still (inaudible at 00:40:48].8) reflexively in my head, like (inaudible at 00:40:51].4) but, um, I don't know being aware of like, being aware of it was, was a very weird time for this period of time being aware that I was doing it. 
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: And feeling I couldn't stop. Um, and I don't think that's...I mean it's not like I feel like I can't stop reframing things. 
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. 
CLIENT: Um, (pause) so most of time I just don't think about it. 
THERAPIST: We're gonna stop for now. We'll be back on Tuesday. 
CLIENT: Yes. [0:41:57.6]
