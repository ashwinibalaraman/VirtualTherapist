<font size="4"><b>14: Anxiety Disorders</b></font>

In this chapter, we will examine the status of information on the assessment and
treatment of anxiety disorders in older adults. Based on recent studies of the
efficacy of interventions for anxiety disorders, there is considerable reason for
optimism regarding the treatment of anxiety in the elderly. Although only a few
empirical studies have examined the efficacy of psychological treatments of
anxiety in the elderly, the data that are available are encouraging and suggest that
interventions are as effective for the elderly as they are for younger adults.


Before reviewing assessment and treatment information, we will briefly
review epidemiologic research on anxiety disorders in the elderly and discuss
age-associated physiological and psychological changes that affect the course
of anxiety in old age. When examining anxiety in the aged, it is important to
consider the variable courses the disorder may have across the life span.
Anxiety may develop for the first time in old age or it may have emerged
earlier in life and continued into old age. If the onset occurred before old age,

<b>Epidemiology</b>


Findings from epidemiologic studies of anxiety provide a varied picture of
its prevalence among older adults. The study of anxiety in the aged and indeed,
psychopathology and aging in general, is complicated by factors such as
cohort effects, differential mortality, age-related differences in willingness to
report symptoms, and selection biases associated with age. When considering
lifetime prevalence rates, one would expect to find increasing prevalence of
all disorders with age. In contrast, recent epidemiologic surveys have consistently
found declining prevalence at later ages (Kessler et al., 1994; Robins
&amp; Regier, 1991) and highest prevalence rates in more recent cohorts. Although
these studies are cross-sectional and therefore do not permit the determination
of the influence of the methodological features mentioned, they do suggest
the intriguing possibility that living into old age decreases an individual's
vulnerability to developing anxiety. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate
the natural history of anxiety across the lifespan.


Although findings from epidemiologic studies have resulted in very different
interpretations of the prevalence of anxiety in old age (e.g., see Fisher,
Zeiss, &amp; Carstensen, 1993; Hersen &amp; Van Hasselt, 1992, for review), evidence
suggests that anxiety is a serious problem for a significant number of older
adults. A community survey in Kentucky found that 17% of elderly men and
21.5% of elderly women reported symptoms of anxiety severe enough to
warrant intervention (Himmelfarb &amp; Murrell, 1984). In contrast, Myers et al.
(1984) reported on data obtained through the multisite epidemiologic catchment
area (ECA). Prevalence rates over a 6-month period for simple phobias
averaged 3.3% for males and 7.0% for females over age 65 years. The
prevalence rates for agoraphobia averaged 1.6% for males and 3.0% for
females over the age of 65 years. The prevalence rates for obsessive-compulsive
disorder averaged 1.3% for males and 1.0% for females. No males met
the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. The prevalence rate for panic
disorder in women over age 65 years averaged 0.2%. When compared with
other age groups, the prevalence rates for all anxiety disorders within the ECA
study were found to be lowest for the 65-plus group. The finding of cohort-associated
decreases in anxiety disorder prevalence reported by Myers et al.
(1984) is consistent with those recently reported by Kessler et al. (1994).


Another community survey (Wisocki, 1988) examining the prevalence of
worrying in older adults ranging in age from 60 to 90 years found that 14%

[p. <i>306</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00312&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The differences in prevalence rates reported in these studies may be due to
the criteria used to identify affected individuals. As Gurian and Miner (1991,
p. 31) report, anxiety tends to be a very common symptom among the elderly
but an "uncommon syndrome." Studies using strict formal diagnostic criteria
(e.g., <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-IV];</i>
American Psychiatric Association, 1994) to assign individuals to diagnostic
classes may eliminate elderly individuals who present an atypical symptom
picture. These individuals may experience anxiety symptoms severe enough
to warrant intervention. At present we do not have enough information about
the manifestation of anxiety in old age to allow us to draw firm conclusions
about age-associated differences in symptomatology.


In general, the symptomatology of specific anxiety disorders does not appear
to differ across adulthood. For example, a recent study found that elderly
individuals with late-onset panic disorder did not experience significantly different
symptoms during a panic attack when compared with adults with panic
disorder whose onset occurred in early to middle adulthood (Raj, Corvea, &amp;
Dagon, 1993). Elderly individuals who developed panic disorder before age 60
tended to report higher rates of social phobia than late-onset panic patients. These
early-onset patients also reported experiencing more compulsive symptoms and
more headaches. Rates of depression were also higher for elderly individuals who
began experiencing panic prior to age 60 years. Elderly individuals who first
experienced panic in old age reported more shortness of breath, chest pains, and
pressure during panic attacks than did early-onset elderly patients.


In considering generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it appears that approximately
50% of elderly individuals (&gt; 65 years) report they first began
experiencing severe anxiety within the previous 5 years (Blazer et al., 1991).
The remaining elderly individuals with GAD tended to report experiencing
anxiety for a much greater duration.


Age-associated differences in health status and medication usage are arguably
the most significant factors contributing to differences in the etiology of
anxiety in old age. These factors will be reviewed in the discussion to follow.


<b>Etiology of Anxiety</b>


BIOLOGICAL FACTORS


Anxiety symptoms in older adults have been consistently found to be
associated with medical illness (Heidrich, 1993; Himmelfarb &amp; Murrell,

[p. <i>307</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00313&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In evaluating symptoms of anxiety in the medically ill, Wise and Rieck
(1993) describe four diagnostic considerations that the clinician must make.
These include (a) ruling out other psychiatric disorders that may be associated
with anxiety, such as depression or delirium; (b) determination of whether the
anxiety symptoms are secondary to the medical illness or are a medication
side effect; (c) determination of the chronology of the medical illness and the
anxiety symptoms; and (d) consideration of the anxiety symptoms as a normal
response to the stress associated with being medically ill.


Evidence from several sources indicates that depression and anxiety share
several characteristics in both their symptomatology and underlying neurochemistry.
Given that the prevalence of depression in the medically ill is significantly
higher than that of the general population (Rodin &amp; Voshart, 1986), the differential
diagnosis of anxiety and depression should be carefully considered.


Delirium also occurs frequently in medically ill patients (Lipowski, 1990)
and is often accompanied by intense anxiety. Anxiety associated with delirium
may be distinguished from an anxiety disorder by the features of disorganized
thinking, thought disturbances (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), memory
dysfunctions, disorientation, difficulties in attention and concentration, and a
disturbance (e.g., reversal) of the sleep-wake cycle (Wise &amp; Rieck, 1993).


CHRONIC ILLNESS AND ANXIETY


The high prevalence of chronic illness in older adults and the increased
debility associated with acute illness increase the likelihood that anxiety may
be secondary to a medical illness or a side effect of a medication.


Physical disorders that have been found to be accompanied by anxiety include
metabolic conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, anemia), endocrine conditions
(e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenalism), cardiovascular

[p. <i>308</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00314&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Panic disorder has been associated particularly with mitral valve prolapse (Raj
et al., 1993), Parkinson's disease (Raj et al., 1993; Stein, Heuser, Juncos, &amp; Uhde,
1990) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; Karajgi, Rifkin, &amp;
Doddi, 1990; Raj et al., 1993; Yellowlees, Alpers, &amp; Bowden, 1987). Studies of
older adults with COPD have reported prevalence rates of panic disorder ranging
from 8% (Karajgi et al., 1990) to 24% (Yellowlees et al., 1987). These findings
suggest that COPD may be an etiologic factor for panic disorder in older adults.
Vertigo has also been found to be associated with panic disorder in older adults
(Raj et al., 1993). It is possible, however, that the dizziness associated with a panic
attack was misdiagnosed as vertigo in these patients (Raj et al., 1993). Raj et al.
note that because the vestibular system has been implicated in panic disorder, it
is possible that the natural age-associated deterioration of this system causes
severe dizziness, vertigo, and panic in older adults.


Phobias have been found to occur at higher prevalence rates in individuals
with diabetes mellitus (Popkin, Callies, Lentz, Colon, &amp; Sutherland, 1988),
Parkinson's disease (Stein et al., 1990), and primary biliary cirrhosis when
compared with the general population (Tarter, Hays, &amp; Carra, 1988). The
mechanisms underlying the development of phobic symptoms in these medical
disorders have not been empirically established. Within diabetes mellitus,
a classical conditioning model has been proposed wherein chronic autonomic
instability and hypoglycemic syndromes are paired with environmental cues
to produce phobic avoidance (Sheehan &amp; Sheehan, 1982).


Within Parkinson's disease, the higher prevalence of social phobias has
been explained by a dopaminergic dysregulation hypothesis. Dopaminergic
deficits are purported to result in introversion and fear, leading to phobic
avoidance of social situations (Stein et al., 1990).


Generalized anxiety disorder was found to occur at an extremely high rate (65%)
in individuals with Graves disease (Trzepacz, McCue, Klein, &amp; Levey, 1988) and
in 10% of individuals with COPD (Anderson, Noyes, &amp; Crowe, 1984) compared
with a prevalence rate of 5.1 % in the general population (Kessler et al, 1994).


DEMENTIA AND ANXIETY


The relationship between anxiety and dementia has not been adequately
addressed by researchers. Several problems contribute to the difficulty in

[p. <i>309</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00315&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The development of anxiety in dementia patients seems highly likely given the
challenges they confront in navigating through an increasingly confusing environment.
Behavioral evidence of anxiety in dementia patients has been found in
reports of caregivers (e.g., Fisher, Goy, Swingen, &amp; Szymanski, 1994; Swearer,
Drachman, O'Donnell, &amp; Mitchell, 1988). Swearer et al. found that 63% of
caregivers of dementia patients residing in the community surveyed reported that
the patient exhibited one or more symptoms of anxiety, including general
fearfulness, a fear of specific objects or events, restlessness, pacing, and appearing
to worry over insignificant matters. Similarly, in a study of 42 dementia patients,
nurses described all Alzheimer's disease patients residing in a nursing home who
engaged in physically assaultive behaviors as appearing distressed when they
were exhibiting aggressive behaviors toward others (Fisher et al., 1994). The
physically aggressive behaviors were consistently described as being associated
with an effort to escape from a stimulus (e.g., a nurse's request) or were associated
with high levels of environmental stimulation.


Whereas the relationship between behavioral disturbances and factors such
as cognitive impairment and functional status have been examined in dementia
patients, the relationship between behavioral disturbances and emotional
states such as anxiety has been ignored. Given that certain serious behavior
problems, such as assaultive behavior, tend to occur when demands are placed
on dementia patients to perform a task (e.g., during dressing and bathing)
(Bridges-Parlet, Knopman, &amp; Thompson, 1994), it would be informative to
evaluate the extent to which anxiety contributes to the behavioral disturbance.
A seemingly benign act on the part of the caregiver may appear quite
threatening to the dementia patient whose cognitive abilities and coping
resources are severely limited. Behavior problems, such as assaultive behavior,
may function as efforts to escape from threatening situations. This
relationship is supported by the finding that caregivers report that behavioral
symptoms of anxiety tend to be significantly associated with angry outbursts
(Swearer et al., 1988). Systematic observation of environmental stimuli
associated with behavioral disturbances in dementia patients is needed. Attention
should also be directed toward the development of methods for
assessing emotional functioning in nonverbal patients.

MEDICATION


The elderly population's large consumption of prescription and nonprescription
medications is an important factor in understanding anxiety in older
adults. In particular, anticholinergic compounds, including antiparkinsonism
medications, antidepressant medication, and antipsychotic medications, have
been found to produce anxiety symptoms (Sifton, 1988).


PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS


Cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, in contrast to psychodynamically
oriented theories, have been the most fruitful in informing the development
of effective treatment strategies and will therefore be emphasized here. A brief
discussion of psychodynamic approaches will be presented.


<i>Psychodynamic theories</i>. As with other theoretical approaches, anxiety in old
age has not received much attention from psychodynamically oriented theorists.
Freudian theorists have emphasized the role of anxiety-producing intrapsychic
forces that threaten to escape conscious control (Verwoerdt, 1980). In
old age, anxiety may also be associated with the anticipation of the loss of
external resources and the subsequent helplessness or dependency. This
anxiety, known as <i>secondary or depletion anxiety</i> (Verwoerdt, 1980), differs
from anxiety that is the result of an overpowering influx of stimuli or anxiety
that is the response to unacceptable impulses that occur across the life span.
A review of the major databases (Medline, PsycLit) produced no empirical
studies of this theory of anxiety in old age. Furthermore, there is little evidence
that psychodynamically oriented theories have resulted in effective treatment
methods for anxiety.


<i>Cognitive-behavioral theories</i>. Learning theorists have presented several
explanations for the development of anxiety. <i>Two-stage theory</i> (Dollard &amp;
Miller, 1950) was the first learning theory to gain prominence. This theory
posits that anxiety develops through a two-stage process. In the first stage, an
individual experiences the pairing of a neutral stimulus with an aversive
stimulus. Through respondent conditioning, the formerly neutral stimulus
acquires anxiety-producing properties. Phobic avoidance of this now anxiety-arousing
stimulus develops as the person seeks to avoid contact with it. The
avoidance results in relief from anxiety and consequently, through negative
reinforcement, becomes habitual. The idea that the avoidance of an aversive
stimulus is reinforcing has been important for the development of exposure

[p. <i>311</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00317&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Cognitive theories of anxiety developed in an effort to redress the limitations
of the two-factor theory. These theories focus on the role of cognitive
events in the development and maintenance of anxiety. They assume that the
expectancy of harm mediates anxiety responses, that these expectancies are
learned, and that the intensity of anxiety is a function of the perception of the
likelihood of danger.


Barlow (1988), in describing a cognitive model of panic, suggests that the
physiological symptoms that accompany panic attacks become conditioned
stimuli for future panic attacks. When these physiological symptoms occur,
even in ordinary situations such as during physical exercise, the individual
begins to anticipate a panic attack. The anticipatory anxiety associated with
the causal attribution for the physical sensations intensifies the physiological
response, and in spiraling fashion, the anxious cognitive and physiological
reactions increase until an attack occurs. Cognitive therapy methods for
reducing anxiety follow directly from this model.


<b>Assessment</b>


Anxiety in the elderly has several associated factors that must be considered
during assessment (Hersen &amp; Van Hasselt, 1992; Hersen et al., 1993). First,
studies on anxiety in the elderly have rarely made the distinction between
anxiety as a <i>syndrome</i> and anxiety as a <i>sign or symptom</i> (e.g., Barrios, 1988).
Although the distinction between anxiety as a sign, symptom, or syndrome
may initially sound trivial in the clinical treatment of anxiety in the elderly,
this distinction ultimately determines the way in which clinicians conceptualize,
assess, and treat anxiety (e.g., Mash, 1985). This distinction may be
especially germane if the anxiety in the elderly is a function of physiological
or biochemical factors (Hersen et al., 1993; Russian, 1986). As mentioned
earlier, several physiological or biochemical maladies can produce or simulate
signs or symptoms of anxiety. Moreover, comorbidity of disease states may
complicate the diagnostic picture. If anxiety signs or symptoms are present in
the elderly, it may be difficult to determine whether the anxiety is a function
of a known physical or biochemical abnormality or if the anxiety is an initial
symptom of some unknown physical or biochemical abnormality (Hersen &amp;

[p. <i>312</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00318&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

SELF-REPORT MEASURES


As indicated in the previous section, many self-report measures of anxiety
do not have norms for the elderly (Hersen &amp; Van Hasselt, 1992; Hussian,
1981; Sheikh, 1991). In reviews of the most commonly used self-report
indices for the assessment of anxiety, Sheikh (1991) and Hersen and Van
Hasselt (1992) indicated that only a few commonly employed self-report
measures for anxiety contain norms for the elderly. These scales are the
Anxiety Status Inventory (ASI; Zung, 1971), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale
(SAS; Zung, 1971), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Speilberger, Gorsuch,
Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983), and Hopkins Symptom Checklist
(SCL-90; see Magni &amp; DeLeo, 1984; Oxman, Barrett, Barrett, &amp; Gerber,
1987). The STAI has been shown to have high internal consistency and
predictive validity and adequate concurrent validity (Spielberger et al., 1983).
The published norms aggregate the "elderly" into a 50-year-old to 69-year-old
age bracket. Thus, the use of the STAI for the assessment of self-reported
anxiety in individuals over 70 may be limited (Hersen &amp; Van Hasselt, 1992;
Sheikh, 1991 ). The ASI and SAS have been shown to have adequate reliability
and predictive validity and may be adequate as a screening device for anxiety
in the elderly (Hersen &amp; Van Hasselt, 1992; Sheikh, 1991). Although the
revised version of the SCL-90 (SCL-90-R) has been shown to have high

[p. <i>313</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00319&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another potential limitation of the currently available self-report measures
involves their content validity. The domain of stimuli and conditions under
which older adults may experience anxiety may differ from younger adults.
Until empirical research examines whether such differences exist, the content
validity of the available measures remains in question.


A recent study (Beck, Stanley, &amp; Zebb, 1995) provides support for the use
of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp;
Borkovec, 1990) with older adults. This study evaluated the psychometric
properties of the PSWQ with data gathered from a sample of elderly individuals
with generalized anxiety disorder and a normal control sample of elderly
subjects. The PSWQ appeared internally consistent based on Cronbach's
alphas of 0.887 and 0.803 for clinical and control samples, respectively.
Factor analyses revealed a two-factor structure reflecting factors of worry and
nonworry for both populations. The authors note that the factor structure of
the PSWQ has been found to be unidimensional in younger samples. Evidence
for the concurrent validity of the PSWQ was apparent in the significant
correlations between the PSWQ and the STAI. Although these findings
suggest that the PSWQ may be appropriate for use with older adults, further
evidence of the discriminant validity of this measure is needed before conclusions
regarding construct validity can be drawn. In interpreting the findings
from this study, the contribution of method variance should be considered,
given the findings of high correlations between the PSWQ and other self-report
measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory and STAI, and the
low correlations between the PSWQ and clinician-rated worry severity.


PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES


Research on the physiological assessment of anxiety has often assumed a
uniform and massive activation of arousal (Bernstein, Borkovec, &amp; Coles,
1986). However, the idea of a uniform pattern of arousal has been supplanted
by a complex pattern of arousal elicited by specific stimuli (e.g., Lacey, 1967).
Because anxiety is no longer viewed as resulting from a uniform arousal
process, the physiological measurement of anxiety becomes more difficult
because of low (but largely untested) reliability (Bernstein et al., 1986;
Nietzel, Bernstein, &amp; Russell, 1988). Moreover, a recent review found no
studies specifically examining psychophysiological correlates of anxiety in
the elderly (Hersen et al., 1993). There is some preliminary evidence, however,

[p. <i>314</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00320&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

BEHAVIORAL MEASURES


In a recent review of the assessment of anxiety in the elderly, Hersen et al.
(1993) noted that most assessments of anxiety were conducted with self-report
measures rather than through direct observation. Behavioral assessments of
anxiety in the elderly have been conducted primarily in the context of treatment
studies (Hersen et al., 1993). No studies have directly addressed the behavioral
assessment of anxiety in the elderly. Moreover, the behavioral assessment of
anxiety in the elderly will require systematization similar to that conducted with
the behavioral assessment of anxiety in the young (Hersen et al., 1993). For
example, behavioral avoidance tests, in which an individual is asked to approach
a feared stimulus, have been modified for use with children (Bernstein et al., 1986;
Nietzel et al., 1988). A large amount of research has revealed that behavioral
avoidance tests with young individuals may be affected by social cues, the
demands of the assessment situation, the communication of positive or negative
consequences, and method variance (Nietzel et al., 1988). Future research may
reveal whether similar factors affect the assessment of behavioral avoidance in
the face of feared stimuli in the elderly.


<b>Treatment</b>


BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT


Many researchers have noted that successful behavioral treatments exist for
the general population suffering from anxiety symptoms and disorders but

[p. <i>315</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00321&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In light of the moderate efficacy of anxiolytic medications in the reduction
of anxiety in elderly individuals and the potential for serious side effects,
Hersen and Van Hasselt (1992, p. 628) asserted that behavioral treatments for
anxiety in the elderly are "highly preferable and safer" relative to the administration
of anxiolytic medications. Some studies of the behavioral treatment
of anxiety in the elderly have demonstrated the efficacy of these methods (see
Table 14.1). The behavioral treatment of anxiety in the elderly is in an
incipient phase, however, and much more research is required before definitive
statements concerning treatment efficacy can be made (Hersen &amp; Van
Hasselt, 1992). Although the behavioral treatment of anxiety in younger
populations has been demonstrated (e.g., Barlow, 1988), the extrapolation of
efficacious behavioral treatments to the elderly population is currently unclear
because of the potential differential clinical picture of anxiety in the elderly.


Whereas Barlow's treatment package for anxiety (e.g., Barlow, 1988;
Barlow &amp; Craske, 1989; Craske, Barlow, &amp; O'Leary, 1992) has proven to be
effective for younger adults (Barlow, 1988), only a few recent preliminary
studies support its efficacy with an elderly population (Stanley, Beck, Barron,
&amp; Wagner, 1994; Stanley, Beck, DeWitt, Deagle, &amp; Zebb, 1994). Although
the reader is referred to Barlow's treatment manuals (Barlow &amp; Craske, 1989;
Craske et al., 1992), the primary treatment components will be briefly discussed.
For generalized anxiety disorder, Craske et al. (1992) suggested
progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive therapy, problem-solving therapy,
time management, goal setting, and exposure (the production of sensations
associated with panic). For panic disorder with or without agoraphobia,

Barlow's treatment for anxiety involves exposure to a feared stimulus or
situation. Research has shown, however, that the elderly may exhibit cognitive
performance decrements under high arousal (Eisdorfer, 1968; Eisdorfer,
Nowlin, &amp; Wilkie, 1970; McCarthy, Katz, &amp; Foa, 1991; Whitbourne, 1976).
In the presence of high autonomic arousal and anxiety, cognitive performance
may be impaired in that response rates may be decreased or that errors of
omission may increase (Eisdorfer, 1968; McCarthy et al., 1991). In Barlow's
treatment package, exposure may lead to high autonomic arousal and anxiety
in the elderly, which in turn may lead to cognitive performance impairment
and reduced learning ability. Thus, it may be beneficial to monitor the anxiety
levels of the elderly during exposure. Exposure to exceedingly high levels of
anxiety may have a detrimental effect on therapeutic outcome. Moreover, it
may be beneficial to first teach anxiety management techniques, such as
progressive muscle relaxation and breathing control exercises, before the
introduction of exposure-based treatment to provide the elderly with skills to
moderate anxiety during exposure (McCarthy et al., 1991).


In addition, some elderly persons may have difficulty with progressive muscle
relaxation due to physical limitations such as arthritis (Scogin, Rickard, Keith,
Wilson, &amp; McElreath, 1992; Zeiss &amp; Lewinsohn, 1986). Relaxation may also be
limited with subjects with COPD due to difficulties in breathing (Scogin et al.,
1992; Zeiss &amp; Lewinsohn, 1986). In these cases, imaginal rather than progressive
muscle relaxation training may be beneficial (Scogin et al., 1992).


SUPPORTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY


Two recent studies (Stanley, Beck, Barron, &amp; Wagner, 1994; Stanley, Beck,
DeWitt, Deagle, &amp; Zebb, 1994) have examined the efficacy of a nondirective
supportive psychotherapy conducted in a group format for older adults with
generalized anxiety disorder. The supportive psychotherapy focused on a
14-session group discussion of anxiety symptoms and experiences. Therapists
encouraged participants to discuss their experiences and provide support for each
other. Although participants were allowed to discuss strategies for coping with
their anxiety, no specific skills were taught, and the therapist avoided providing
differential reinforcement for any particular coping strategy.


The effectiveness of the supportive psychotherapy was compared with
cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), which was also conducted in a group
format. The CBT included three components: progressive deep muscle relaxation,
cognitive restructuring, and graduated exposure to anxiety-producing
situations. Results indicated that both CBT and supportive psychotherapy

PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT


Pharmacological agents are frequently used in the treatment of anxiety
(Patterson, 1988). This is in large part due to the fact that recent cohorts of
older adults are inclined to report anxiety symptoms to medical doctors.
Furthermore, there is evidence that pharmacological intervention rather than
psychotherapy is more frequently prescribed for older adults than for younger
adults or children (Cohen &amp; Eisdorfer, 1985).


Special considerations are required for the general use of pharmacological agents
with the elderly experiencing anxiety (Markovitz, 1993; also see Chapter 22, this
volume). First, medication absorption may be variable in the elderly due to elevations
in levels of gastric acid. Second, the duration of time a medication is present
in an elderly person's system may be reduced because the individual may have more
difficulty metabolizing medications. Moreover, due to decreased liver blood flow,
smaller amounts of medication may be entering the elderly person's system (thus,
the half-life of the medication may be affected). Third, coexisting medical disorders
may affect anxiolytic action with the elderly. Moreover, the medication used to treat
the medical illness may interact with anxiolytic medication.


The benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment
of anxiety (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993; Swartz et al., 1991)
and have been prescribed for up to 50% of the elderly experiencing anxiety
(Salzman, 1991b). However, there are several side effects and considerations in
the use of benzodiazepines as an anxiolytic agent for the elderly. First, as
indicated, the elderly may have decreased liver blood flow that may lead to
decreased benzodiazepine metabolism and elimination. As a result, benzodiazepine
metabolites may accumulate (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp; Moran,
1993). Thus, benzodiazepines that are conjugated (i.e., lorazepam, temazepam,
and oxazepam) and more easily metabolized have been recommended for use
with the elderly (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993). Second, high-potency
benzodiazepines may produce an exaggerated response in the elderly
and, therefore, low-potency benzodiazepines are recommended (Markovitz,
1993). Third, there are several side effects that may affect the elderly, such as
memory disturbances, disorientation, drowsiness, and gait disturbances that
may lead to falls (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993).


Buspirone is a relatively new anxiolytic medication that appears promising
for reducing anxiety in the elderly (Levine, Napoliello, &amp; Domantay, 1989).

[p. <i>322</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00328&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Beta-blockers may also be effective in reducing anxiety in the elderly, especially
for the reduction of physical symptoms such as tremulousness, perspiration,
and tachycardia (Markovitz, 1993). Like Buspirone, beta-blockers may be effective
for the elderly experiencing GAD, although beta-blockers generally do not
reduce marked fear or panic (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993). In
addition, beta-blockers may be contraindicated for individuals with asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart disease (Stoudemire &amp; Moran,
1993). Beta-blockers may also have side effects such as insomnia, nightmares,
and nocturnal hallucinations (Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993).


Despite the appeal for the use of neuroleptics in the treatment of anxiety, this
class of medication is not generally recommended for use with the elderly
(Markovitz, 1993). Neuroleptics are primarily avoided because of the potential
for tardive dyskinesia. Other classes of anxiolytic drugs are recommended
because of their efficacy and superior safety (Markovitz, 1993; Stoudemire &amp;
Moran, 1993). Neuroleptics have been used to treat anxiety and agitation associated
with dementia, psychotic symptoms, delirium, or combinations of these.


Tricyclic antidepressants have been used in the effective treatment of anxiety
(Markovitz, 1993). The selection of the appropriate antidepressant is primarily
based on relative side effects (see Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993, for a comparison
of side effects). Similar to neuroleptics, the use of antidepressants has been limited
due to the frequency of associated side effects, such as sedation, anticholinergic
effects, and orthostatic effects (Stoudemire &amp; Moran, 1993). A new serotonin
specific re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, has been introduced, however,
that does not have the associated side effects, although the efficacy on reducing
anxiety in the elderly has not been empirically established (Stoudemire &amp; Moran,
1993). Fluoxetine was approved by the FDA in 1994. Information regarding the
efficacy of SSRIs for treating anxiety in the elderly is not yet available.


<b>Conclusions</b>


The research reviewed in this chapter indicates that although anxiety occurs
at significant rates in the elderly, the treatment of anxiety appears to be as

Although old age naturally presents the challenges of physical and emotional
losses that may seem overwhelming to the young, the ability to competently
cope with these losses is indeed probably the most remarkable aspect
of the relationship between aging and anxiety. Perhaps through the study of
the means by which the majority of older adults rise to the challenges
associated with aging, researchers will better inform the treatment of anxiety
across the lifespan.
