I might have been better off just masturbating my entire life. I recall
before I ever even experienced an orgasm, my buddy, Phil, called
during the dinner hour, sounding so euphoric and with such a sense
of urgency in his tone that my folks, who didn't like me to leave the
dinner table for calls, made an exception with the instruction to
keep it short and call him back after the meal. When I picked up the
phone, all my ten-year-old schoolmate had to say were the words,
"Yank it!" before he hung up.


I didn't exactly put it together right away what Phil meant, and
for weeks I yanked everything in my room except my penis: shades,
switches, the sheets—everything. Until, one night, running out of
things to yank, in a state of frustration, I yanked my penis. And I
kept yanking it, and then something happened midway through the
episode that signaled my brain to not let me stop. I didn't stop; and
then it happened. I came! Holy, fuckin', son-of-a-fuckin', amazing,
joy-to-the-world discovery! It might not have been a spiritual awakening
but it sure got my attention. I had no idea life could feel so
good. And I'm not sure it's ever felt as good since. In fact, after that
first cum, even though I was still a virgin, there was no reason to
ever come out of my room again. But for a number of reasons, like

And then it finally happened, although it didn't come from God
but from a pal of mine. He'd lost his condom inside this high school
junior, a buxom spitfire, then seemed to suffer a slight nervous
breakdown over the mishap and I seized the moment, which
delightfully turned into the beginning of the end of my virginity.


I was about sixteen and was primarily frightened that I'd never
get accepted into a college. I was also paralyzed with fear that I
would remain both zit-faced and hypochondriacal, and was scared
shitless of going into New York for a hooker or making it with one of
the school sluts and maybe getting a disease that might ruin my dick
forever, even though the daily disgrace I felt over being a virgin was
driving me insane. As far as sex went, I was striking out. I had the
worst time finding a decent young woman who would mercifully
make me feel like a man, and quite frankly, where or when this
transformation might occur could have hardly mattered as long as I
officially had penetration. I would have gladly settled for almost any
scenario to get that monkey off my back and my penis into someone's
nirvana. I was desperate! A sympathy lay was next on my
agenda. I privately jotted down names of potential women who
might be of service to me if I was able to come up with the proper
frantic fairy tale. Basically, I was praying for any decent-looking
chick to help me finally taste manhood and would have gladly settled
for a surreptitious, unceremonious fuck in the janitor's closet,
say after Folk Dancing club wound down its activities. Beggars can't
be choosers when one's manhood is at stake.


It's a striking contrast when I realize that just a few years after this
adolescent torment I would soon be in the middle of the "summer of
love," and my penis would have such a full date book that it would

So when my buddy felt his life was over after allegedly screwing
some girl from a rival high school, having his condom stay in her
vagina long after he was gone, and ejaculating a potential child into
this incredibly hot-looking babe, I hardly felt badly for him. Rather, I
was consumed with jealousy. I would have taken on his fear of
impregnating someone in a flash if only I could have lost my virginity
in the bargain. The drama began around 2 A.M. The party was
over and once again I hadn't scored. A few guys from our high
school were munching on chips while my friend was humping away
in his bedroom. Each moan made me cringe with resentment. He
finally emerged half naked and screaming for guidance. The girl in
question, this siren of sirens, coolly called a cab, and got herself as far
away from the frightened, neurotic, hysterical display by my shaken
friend as possible. I kid the feminists, but even though this condom
faux pas had the potential to become a major problem, I found
myself focusing more on her vagina than on my buddy's paranoia
and deteriorating mental state. I heard nothing as he pleaded with
us indifferent, unsympathetic wise guys to get him out of this jam.
My eyes were totally fixed upon the woman in question and I was

I went home, a man with a mission to have his first legitimate
emission, and immediately called this curvaceous answer to my
dreams. An older woman answered so I hung up faster than I would
eventually cum once I actually got the chance to have intercourse.
(And trust me, that took some doing. It wasn't my fault or the girl's
but my cock just wouldn't be a team player). The next day I got the
girl at home and found out that her mother had answered the night
before. She went to some school in a neighboring town and, though
I rambled on and on about how guilty I felt hitting on her right after
she'd been with my friend, nonetheless it was still only days later
that I got the chance of my young lifetime.


She apparently wanted me, and from what I learned later, many
others (at any time, regardless of where or when). That hardly mattered
to me at the outset, a whining virgin who had done everything
I could with a woman except feel what it was like to slip that "thing"
inside that mysterious other "thing" and I was beside myself with
glee. To make matters even better, my parents were planning to

We planned a date and she seemed happy enough to just come
over to the house and get to know each other. I avoided talking to
my pal but through the grapevine I heard he was still bemoaning the
fact that he might have gotten my new flame pregnant, and was carrying
on like his life was over. I never mentioned this nor did I tell
her that I hid about forty condoms under every conceivable hiding
place in the house, just in case. I was so excited I even put a few Trojans
in the refrigerator. What did I know? I thought we might wind
up fucking in front of the fridge and I didn't want to have to excuse
myself and locate my protection in another room, let alone a few
feet away from the "act." God forbid she might lose interest, or
worse yet, get pangs of guilt about my despondent friend and not
only go back to him, but spill the beans before I could spill my seeds.


The next forty-seven and a half hours were intercourse hell!
Cocky, I first sat by the fireplace for about eight seconds and held her
hand before I tried, as romantically as possible, to rip her clothes off.
I didn't have to. She ripped her own clothes off except her bra,
which she (for some cruel, psychic reason) might have known I
would struggle with, and I did so, until she groaned something that
sounded like, "Jews are so bad with mechanical things," and undid
the hooks or whatever they are until, there she was—stark naked.
Instantly I had to think of a way to get us upstairs and into my bed,
because even in the heat of the moment I couldn't help but think
that if I ejaculated on anything in that living room, most of which

After two days and nights of trying every bed, chair, couch, and
room in the house, finally, without thinking what it might mean to
me psychologically down the line, I got a great hard-on, and in the

But not that night!!!!!! Oh no, baby, I wouldn't take that event
away from me regardless of how I smelled my mother when I came.
My new girlfriend, at least from my glorious vantage point, was too
young to mock me, and I was too happy to undermine what I
thought was perhaps the single most important thing I had ever
done.


The relationship didn't last long, though, and many years later I
apologized to my buddy for stealing his lay. He seemed to understand,
considering at the time of my amends he was already married
and had a young baby and was perplexed as to why it had taken me
decades to admit. He actually seemed quite pleased that he'd had a
hand in helping me through that rite of passage and was more
inclined to ask me just how many other friends had fucked him
over. Of course I didn't know and now as I look back on myself as
this horny teenager and try to figure out if there is much difference
in me (thirty-five years later) in my evolution as a human being,
sexually speaking, all I can think of is that I might be a better lover,
that I can get an erection anywhere with almost any woman in
almost any climate range, and yet, sadly, other than for that first
time, somewhere along the line I've lost the concept that I can <i>still</i>
enjoy myself without only caring about <i>how good</i> I perform. But far
more important, I'm still aching for a good sexual run with one
woman, when making love will have far more to do with feeling a
deeper connection as a couple, rather than just an act, with nothing
more to it than feeling like I had a great high school gym class.


Like I said, I might have been better off just masturbating my
entire life. At least then I wouldn't have jerked anyone <i>else</i> around.
