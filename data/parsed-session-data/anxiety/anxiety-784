In the winter of 1896 I made a journey
to St. Augustine, Fla., to look after
the affairs of a relative of mine who
owned large property interests in that
city. Henry M. Flagler, the Standard
Oil magnate, had built a portion of the
Ponce de Leon Hotel on property belonging
to my family's estate. Many law
suits had been fought over the property,
and it was my province to effect a settlement.


The work I had to do was of a difficult
nature, and caused me much anxiety.


Previous to going to Florida, I had
led a very irregular life as a reporter on
New York newspapers, losing much
sleep and neglecting my meals. I greatly

It was at this time that my health began
to break down. I suffered intense
neuralgic pains in the head, and my left
arm was swollen with rheumatism, I
took large doses of phenacetin and a liberal
supply of iron tonic, but nothing
seemed to benefit my condition.


As my health seemed to be growing
worse each day in St. Augustine, I decided
to return for a few weeks to my
home.


I had not been home very long before
a well known society woman asked me to
write a play to be produced at one of her
entertainments. I undertook the commission.


The worry and mental strain over the
play, together with the other anxieties I
had undergone, broke down my health,
and I succumbed, finally, to an attack of
nervous prostration.


It came about in this way:

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177195-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night, about eight o'clock, I
thought I would stroll down to the post
office. My sister offered to accompany
me. I think she had observed that I was
in a highly nervous state, and feared,
even then, that something would happen
to me.


We were walking slowly along a dark
section of one of the streets, when two
men suddenly jumped out in front of us
from behind a building. I had no revolver,
my only weapon being a light bamboo
walking cane.


Placing my sister quickly behind me, I
stepped forward and was about to lay
the stick across the nearest man's face
when, most opportunely, a policeman
came upon the scene from an adjoining
alley. Both men made off as swiftly as
their legs would carry them.


We continued our walk to the post
office, discussing our narrow escape.
Both of us were very nervous. I was

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177195-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We returned to our home by a more
circuitous, though better-lighted, route,
reaching the house about eleven o'clock.


On expressing my intention to retire to
my room, my sister said she would walk
up stairs with me. Somehow, she seemed
loath to leave me. Doubtless, she had
observed in my manner some strange
sign which betokened that all was not
well with me.


My room was on the top floor. Its
front windows faced the south, and overlooked
a beautiful sheet of water which,
on this night, I well remember, shone like
beaten silver, in the moonlight.


Far on the other side of the river, I
could see the tall outlines of palmetto
trees, standing like sentries, as if to safeguard
the peace of the quiet scene.


Without removing my clothes I lay
down upon the foot of the bed. My sister
sat beside me. For some time we discussed

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177195-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly, while speaking to her, I noticed
that her face seemed very far away.
Its outline was very clear and distinct;
but it seemed to be removed many miles,
and I felt as if I were looking at her
through an inverted telescope.


Her voice, also, seemed to be very distant.
At the same time, I felt a peculiar
sensation in my ears. It seemed as
if I heard thousands of tiny bells ringing
with wonderful rapidity.


My sister began talking strangely of
Death. I thought she was saying to me
that she had become possessed by a spirit
of some kind, and I imagined that I myself
was being gradually overpowered by
the same influence.


Striving against this strange power,
which seemed to be enveloping my body
in a great fold, and permeating every
part of it, I decided to tear myself away,
and call for assistance.


Jumping up, I madly wrenched open

I then rushed down stairs, and burst
into the room of a guest of the family.
She, too, was sleeping, but I called loudly
to her to run to the aid of my sister.


This second message delivered, I ran
to my mother's room. She was sleeping
in an extension across a little bridge
which connected our house with a small
outhouse. Over this little bridge I ran,
carrying my awful message.


My mother promised to come to my
sister's aid immediately, and told me to
run back to her.


I returned to my room.


She and my brother were talking ani
matedly as I came in. They stopped when
they saw me. My sister seemed to be
looking wildly about her. My brother

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177195-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I imagined I could hear outside my
door hosts of devils struggling to get at
me. I ordered the door shut.


The idea uppermost in my mind was
that I should have the devils exorcised
by a priest. I felt if I could but run to
the church and obtain the assistance of a
reverend gentleman whom I knew, matters
would soon be right.


I announced my intention to go to the
church in order to have the devils exorcised.


It was now far past midnight. My
brother told me this, and tried to persuade
me not to go.


But I was obdurate I tried to plunge
through the window, but my brother held
me to the bed with all his might.


Unknown to me, my mother had sent
for several doctors and for my uncle,

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177195-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By this time, I was talking wildly and
incessantly. I recited passages from
Shakespeare, Byron, Keats, Shelley--I
delivered orations on political questions--
I cracked jokes, and made all sorts of
remarks of wondrous irrelevancy.


When dawn came, there were about ten
persons gathered around my bed. Some
were holding my feet; others my hands.
In the crowd, I noticed a policeman.
There was a look in his eye which I did
not like, and; suddenly, I launched out
with one of my feet and succeeded in
kicking him all the way across the room.


The eyes of every one seemed riveted
on me with strange glances. I imagined
that each person around me--even my
mother--was a devil, and that they were
all gathered there to carry me off to the
nethermost regions of Hell.


I glared defiantly into their faces, and
forbid them, in the name of Christ, to
touch me.
