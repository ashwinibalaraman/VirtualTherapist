BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Jess got me this t-shirt when she went to a museum in South Carolina; it's like a museum for attorneys.
THERAPIST: It's pretty funny (laughing).
CLIENT: Yes its clever. So I was crazy anxious yesterday, I was supposed to go to a rotary meeting in Bristol and a guy who I was going as his guest, had a new client situation come up and couldn't go. So I just looked at all this condo stuff that I should be doing and realized that I should have sent it and did an affidavit of attorney's fees for my summary judgment motion. [00:01:16]
Which I can probably send in, I inadvertently left this out, but I don't know, if it's just that or what, but I was really anxious yesterday. It's like I had to leave, I went home and took a clonopin and I was still, even after I took that, I was still pretty anxious.
THERAPIST: So you're supposed to go to the rotary club meeting in Bristol and the guy bailed and then you didn't go, because you were going to go as his guest.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And then you were looking at the condo stuff, are you referring to the condo where there's that case?
CLIENT: Yes I've got a continuing tax education book it's like first of all, I should have looked in there for a lot of the stuff, like the summary judgment motion. The case is slightly different, this is basically the courts, if you do it right, will treat the condos like taxes, it goes in front of the mortgage, at least the last six months. [00:02:25]
So you can keep doing it every six months, so there's a sample summary judgment motion, there's all of the stuff in there that I could have used that I didn't use, and I don't know why, to me it seems that there was something else going on and I don't know what it was. And I don't know if it's because I forgot the attorney's fees thing and I was nervous about that, I don't know. I had a very, just odd weekend. I really hurt myself overeating on Friday night.
THERAPIST: How come, what happened?
CLIENT: I just kept eating and Friday and Saturday, I was in pain all day Saturday and Ian was supposed to stay over Saturday night and I was about to call Jess to come pick him up. And then on Sunday it was still bothering me and I was like walking the dog and I felt like I had to go to the hospital, it hurt so much. [00:03:36]
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: I didn't, Saturday night I barely ate anything and then Sunday night I ate too much again, not to the point that it hurt but I'm getting on these super binging modes where it's just I eat and eat and eat.
THERAPIST: What was going on Friday night?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: Were you with Ian?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: No he came over Saturday night, I really don't know.
THERAPIST: Were you anxious through the day?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: I don't know, I don't know if it was, I don't know what happened on Friday. I don't know. (Pause) There's no rhyme or reason I guess that I can think of, and I don't know if that's what was causing the stomach pain or not, you know, it makes sense that it was, but it lasted for like a day and a half. And then finally went away Sunday afternoon, late Sunday. [00:05:12]
THERAPIST: I think my impression that it has to do with anxiety probably one way or another right?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes, I don't know, I mean my anxiety's just been ramped up. I got a text from Jess after blowing off, it's not like I have a ton of work to do, but I need to get that affidavit out and I'm negotiating a PNS and Jess wants me to pick Ian up from school and he wants to play with me today. It's like, picking him up from school is at 2:30, I'm meeting someone in Plymouth at 11:30 so that's an hour or hour and a half there. So that's one o'clock, there's just no time for me to get the work done. And I just feel so bad for the kid because he's really having a hard time with the lack of attention from his mom.
THERAPIST: Between work and Lucille?
CLIENT: Yes and he had a rough time at the playground on Sunday, I'm told, where just there's several episodes of him being overly, hitting another kid and then an older kid being very rough with him to the point that he was scared of getting thrown down on the ground. At least that's how Jess describes it. And so it's now I feel, when he comes over, he doesn't spend time with me, he goes and plays with his old girlfriend down stairs. [00:06:53]
And only when they get ready for their baths and stuff, does he come upstairs. And then he wants to watch Two and a Half Men even if it's not on. But he thinks that the same thing that's on Friday night is on Saturday. And Buddy, it's not on. I don't remember what we ended up watching but he stayed up until like nine o'clock, we were watching Seinfeld or something like that, which is rated G.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But Ian did ask me what sex was? I can't remember what I answered.
THERAPIST: When was that, was that on Saturday?
CLIENT: No that was like Saturday afternoon. I can't remember, I can't, all of the days are kind of merging into one. And I also have to pick up my car, my car might be ready today. Which I'm not excited about the dollar amount there. That may be a part of my anxiety as well, just the whole money situation. My car, it's like I'm spending all of this money on my car and it's still broken and everybody's like just get a new car, well do they sell nice used cars for three thousand dollars? Do they give credit to someone who just had a bankruptcy? It's like even, I've got to figure out what the IRS stuff is going to be, that's another thing I haven't done. What the payments going to be, because before I can take on another car, I could probably have my dad cosign a car loan, but two, three hundred bucks a month, I can't afford that. [00:09:01]
I have bad answers for everything. (Pause)
THERAPIST: It sounds like one thing that you're worried about is screwing up with this case?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes, I think about all of the time. [00:10:16]
THERAPIST: What is it that you think about?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Just that I've done it wrong and it's like I can't, when I go back and I think about it, my thought process and why I'm treating a case like I'm treating instead of doing it like priority of the lien case, is because this isn't about a woman who is not paying her condo fees, she paying a condo fee that she thinks is supposed to be the condo fee. It's about her accepting the increased condo fee, accepting the special assessment, accepting fines. Basically it's really about who has power in the trust, two trustees trumps one trustee and she won't accept that. And so I've took the case in a direction that I thought was more geared towards that instead of the priority, I'm not so concerned about having priority over her mortgage. I imagine that, I wrestle with this all of the time and I've got this new case, new client coming on that it is a priority situation, where we would push going to foreclosure on the condo if they didn't pay. [00:11:57]
Two units out of four. I just got a call from the treasurer, a stupid question, I'm sitting here waiting for the retainer to come in so I can start billing on it. And it's kind of a good area of the law to get into, but I don't know. (Pause) I've got no good answers for anything is the problem, it's like no matter what I'm thinking about.
THERAPIST: What isn't clear to me is an answer you just gave about why you're treating the first case in the way that you are, on the face of it, it made sense. [00:12:57]
CLIENT: Yes but I struggle with that because I forget that the reason why I do it, and I'm still, I've got a summary judgment motion which I've never argued before and if I get a judgment I've got to collect the judgment which I've never done before. It's like something I just don't know how to do. I've got to go in and ask the judge to order her tenant to pay us instead of the landlord which we're entitled to. So there's all of these things and I just don't know how you do that, I don't know what the process is for any of that. I've got a lawyer friend I'm going to have to call and ask him.
THERAPIST: Is some of this that you feel like so many things in your life have got fucked up that when there's a new thing like this that you haven't done before and expectedly are a little shaky in your confidence on, it really scares the hell out of you because so many things haven't been going well, that this inevitably won't go well sometime? Even if you'd probably be perfectly capable at it? [00:14:19]
CLIENT: I don't know, we'll find out, we'll find out. I don't know, like yesterday being able, part of the anxiety was the ability to be anxious and go home and not do any work. No one missed me, there were no phone calls, maybe the lawyer called me late in the day about PNS I'm negotiating, but I don't know, just. I went and dropped off, Jess had gotten a CD in the mail from one of the courts of transcripts and I went to drop it off and she was at the office, and she's just blabbing, blab, blab, I even told her that I'm really anxious right now. She's just blabbing and telling me a story about Ian and telling me about why she doesn't like the day care now and what she likes about the new daycare, just on and on, blah, blah, I wanted to get the fuck out of there. [00:15:55]
And I get home and I'm bored out of my fucking mind.
THERAPIST: I think what would have been helpful would have been for her to reassure you, like to, I'm not going to say this going to happen but...
CLIENT: ...Come on, you really think she would?
THERAPIST: I'm not talking about it from the point of view of what would be likely to happen more so from where were you at, what would have helped you, almost kind of diagnostically about what's going on, like for her to have paid attention to what you were so worried about, stop talking about what she was going to talk about. And then been supportive and tell you that you'll figure it out, you'll do a good job. Even if its new, you're smart, you can do this. I imagine something like that would have made a difference. [00:16:56]
CLIENT: I don't know, she didn't even really inquire into why I was anxious.
THERAPIST: I get it, this is turning into a history of what actually happened.
CLIENT: I realized late, how everybody was going outside, it was such a nice day, and here I am it's like five o'clock and I've barely been outside, I've been sitting in my apartment since like 2:30 or 3:00, so I finally just took the dog for a walk. It's just not even a big deal to me, so it's a nice day, there's going to be plenty of nice days. It's not like we had this brutal winter that aaahh, the sun's shining, we can wear a short sleeved t-shirt. [00:17:56]
I had a draft for March Madness last night. I didn't drink at all, it's pretty strange. Part of it was because my stomach still bothers me a little bit but the other part was I just didn't really feel like it, I didn't want to spend the money, didn't want to go to the liquor store, just didn't feel like drinking, not even a couple of casual beers which probably would have helped me out tremendously. But once I got home, I was kind of revved up and couldn't really focus on going to sleep. I thought I set my alarm which apparently I didn't slide the little thing to on. [00:18:59]
THERAPIST: I think it's hard to think about what's making you anxious.<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Because I was anxious, I got up at five o'clock yesterday to go to a E&G; think at seven in Bristol in the morning. So my body's still thinking its four o'clock because I was still stuck on whatever. So I was tired, but I was a little nervous about the rotary thing, something new, I know at least one person there, she used to be in our group, but I don't know what goes on at rotary meetings. I think it would have been the nerves that anybody would have had going into something new, maybe slightly more. And had that building up for a couple of days and then at the last minute for it to be cancelled but there was somewhat a relief, but now to put it off another week or two weeks or, it's really important that I join a rotary and I've got to decide whether I like this one or whether I should go to the one in Concord. So I've got to visit both. [00:20:26]
I don't know, that's the part that bothers me sometimes is that it's just general anxiety, I don't know, there's no trigger or anything like that.
THERAPIST: I'm not so sure. I think there may be triggers, you don't feel like this all of the time and you're talking about ways that you're on the spot, new things that you're taking on and I imagine that has a lot to do with why you're so anxious. When you think about doing the new rotary. I mean, look at it this way, you told me last week that you should have been doing this years ago, you haven't done it, was not really clear why. This is probably part of it is that you see a social situation, it's a risk in various ways. [00:21:33]
CLIENT: But I'm so far behind the eight ball in so many different things, it's like I have got to cash out Ian's life insurance policy, there's like a thousand bucks in there and I need that money. And so I've got to pull that out of his policy, which is like a little 25,000 dollar policy that I was going to show him how saving works and put money away and dividends and that's gone. Well look, here's where your dad was broke and had to pull a thousand dollars out. And it just, I think it's so many things combined, is what I'm trying to say, by general anxiety, it's not one thing.
THERAPIST: What is it that makes you anxious about the thing about Ian? That sounds very sad that you have to pull the money out and you can't show it to him. [00:22:31]
CLIENT: Yes, it's like my dad and my mom just dropped almost eleven grand in my lap and I'm still broke. I'm still not coming up with enough money to pay the bills at the office, I've got no work coming in. I'm supposed to have a closing with the bank, they say March, who knows. I'm supposed to have a closing of a woman that E&G; referred to me, a couple who are buying a house but she e-mails me yesterday, she thinks the deals going to die because they had their home inspection and its Fannie Mae and its foreclosure, there's no room for negotiations with that. I don't know, its, I've got too much time on my hands. There's just not work for me to do, there's work, some work for me to do but I just can't wrap my hands around it. [00:23:39]
THERAPIST: I hear what you're saying and I know it's all true, and it's incredibly stressful to be so far behind financially. I am not doubting that in the slightest, I think it makes a lot of sense. But the thing that doesn't quite fit with it, it's been true for a while things have been this bad and there's something that caused an uptake in your anxiety just over the last few days. So I understand about the kind of ongoing financial stress has been awful, really terrible. But I just think that actually taking on some new stuff, it could be, I don't know, other things as well, that have caused you to be more anxious just recently. It doesn't square for me that it's just the financial stress, because that's been there for so long. [00:24:49]
CLIENT: No, I know, it's so many different things. No matter what I think of, it's just, there's no, you know, I don't want to say I'm pessimistic because it's true, it's not like I'm painting an ugly picture, things are ugly. It's not like I'm not, well you have beautiful children, you know.
THERAPIST: You do have beautiful children but you're broke.
CLIENT: Yeah I'm broke, Lucille now is going back to being having separation anxiety so I can't even touch the kid now. Ian, you know, comes over and barely spends two minutes with me, and then I've got the feeling that I don't really even know what I'm going to do in those ten minutes. We put a Lego thing together with his old girlfriend, it's like I'm getting nothing out of it. It's not that I don't want to be with my son, it's just. [00:26:09]
THERAPIST: Do you feel worse somehow when you're supposed to be playing with him. Or is it more like your overall level of worry and stress and preoccupation makes it impossible to enjoy him?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes, I don't know. It's always been like that with him, from day one, I've been excessively stressed out. I remember when he was a little baby, I'd be sitting there and holding him and bouncing him on the ball, just freaking out about everything. Six years of that and I got a text from Jess Sunday morning, how when am I bringing Ian home because they had been talking about making pancakes for like five days. And he went downstairs and had pancakes with his little friend downstairs. I told her that and she got really sad and upset, it's just like. And they're having a rough relationship. It's like look at it from my position, you know, how would you like to be in my boat where you're not even, a second class citizen would be an upgrade. [00:27:34]
It's like I've got, nothing, put Ian in the middle of the room and have us both call him, I could call him and she could say nothing and he's still going to go to her. The same thing is happening with the baby, it's like. And I feel part of it is that she's fucked the kids up somehow by over protecting them and you know, it's like, I don't know. I have no sort of say in how they're raised or if it was up to me, they wouldn't be this way. They'd learn to be a little more independent and not so, I am not that warm, fuzzy person that they can just come and hold on to for all day long. At some point I'm going to yell at them and tell them to get the fuck off. [00:28:52]
It's like all Jess does now, instead of arguing with me now, she argues with Ian. But then again, I don't know, it's not comfortable for me. And I'm going to go over there and pick him up from school. I don't know what we're going to play, we're going to play something that I'm not going to enjoy or get any enjoyment out of. And then there's going to be some fight over dinner or brushing teeth. So there will be some fight, you know, and her personality can't just let things go. He's going to change his position over and over again to continue to keep the fight going. That's my perception of what a six year old is. You can't reason with them, you know. Hey Ian the sky is blue, no it's not blue it's red. No it's not red, look its blue. No it's red. And you prove to him, this is the color red, this is the sky, are they the same? [00:30:02]
Well I didn't mean that it was red, I meant that, you know, he'll start stuttering and stuttering until he can come up with something new. It feels red. He's always finding some different way, so I don't know where I'm heading, just babbling at this point.
THERAPIST: Well everyone's against you.
CLIENT: Yes. Except my parents. Who I could, I don't have a great relationship with my parents. I don't call them up or anything like that. Unless they bother me or I need money. Send an e-mail are you still alive? [00:31:13]
(Pause) I've got to change my address on the car to the Andover address, and I'm torn between should I get a sticker, should I not get a sticker. My life would be easier if I got a sticker but how long am I going to still be living in Andover. So I don't know. Maybe that's what I can do, is drag Ian to the City Hall Annex, it's like a block from the house, walk over there and get a sticker. And he wants to spend time with me, I don't get to see daddy, I don't spend any time with daddy. And it's like you had a whole weekend to spend time with me. [00:32:24]
So it's like the day I've got to go to Plymouth again, I have this meeting at 11:30. And I already blew, changed the date of this meeting once, with someone and E&G; and I really hate when people do that to me. So I don't like doing that to other people. Go up there, get the mail, turn around, come back home, get no work done. Except maybe putting up this purchase and sale agreement.
THERAPIST: Alright.
CLIENT: I know I'm all over the place.
THERAPIST: What would make Ian happy this afternoon?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Ice cream.
THERAPIST: Other things?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: TV and sugar you know, playing with my phone. That's what would make him happy.
THERAPIST: TV with you or phone with you and sugar or just? [00:33:32]
CLIENT: It's like if he had the choice of riding in the car with his mom or riding in the car with me, he rides in the car with me because he knows he can play on my phone. So I don't know that it's so much about me, that he misses me or he misses my, because Jess had a game on the I Pad, but he's not allowed to use the I Pad.
THERAPIST: So if you wanted to keep him happy this afternoon, you'd take him for ice cream, give him some time to play the game?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: I really wouldn't take him for ice cream.
<br />
 THERAPIST: Why, the cost?
CLIENT: Part of it yes and I don't think he should be eating ice cream every day. I don't know, to me, ice cream is like a special occasion. I'd take him to the coffee shop and let him cookie or something, some form of sugar. [00:34:33]
THERAPIST: And that would also make him happy.
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Are there other things as well that he would enjoy?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Well I don't know, he may have a Lego set that hasn't been put together yet, that's a dad and Ian activity is putting these Lego things together. Which it used to be just me putting the Lego's together but now he can do it and he can look at the instructions and do it himself.
THERAPIST: I would guess he kind of enjoys having you either help him or watch how amazing he is at it.
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes that's why he wants to spend time with me to some degree, you know but.
THERAPIST: I would guess that you feel, I mean you did some Lego's with him, took him out for a cookie and let him play, and he had a good time, I suspect you'd feel pretty good about that. I am not saying that would cure your anxiety, I'm just saying you'd feel good about it. [00:35:54]
CLIENT: I don't know. I'd be anxious the whole time.
<br />
 THERAPIST: You'd probably be anxious anyway. (Pause)
CLIENT: Do I look like I've lost weight? Except in my gut. (Pause) I don't know. (Pause)
THERAPIST: I guess the point I'm making, I don't know if it's clear about doing stuff with Ian, this afternoon is that I think it's probably, it's going to be a lot of work for you, especially if you're feeling anxious and really crappy which I think you're feeling. And it's hard to stay with what a kid wants and keep them entertained and answer the five million questions and shepherd them through whatever they're trying to do. It's hard work and it's going to be hard to feel like you're up to it. I think you're worried it's going to get all fucked up somehow and then something will go wrong and it won't work and he won't have fun and you'll feel like you're tried and failed at something else. [00:38:24]
I think those are the things that make it difficult to, in the case with him, focus on trying to have a good time with him. But I think if you do, and it goes okay, it will probably make you feel better. Does it fix your anxiety? No. Does it make you feel amazing? No. But I suspect it helps you feel like you've done something you can feel good about. And that can be similar to some other things.
CLIENT: Just then I was not paying attention to what you were saying. And first I was thinking about how I've got to do the IRS stuff, but I can't bring myself to do it. And then I started thinking about drafting that affidavit for attorneys' fees. And how the things I needed to do for that. And just my mind just, I don't know, I didn't hear a word you said. I was distracted but that's what I was thinking about, I don't know how I got there. [00:39:40]
THERAPIST: I imagine two things, one is that of course you're preoccupied and stressed with these big stressful things. And the other is, I don't think you really want to hear what I had to say because I was encouraging you to do something that's hard to do.
CLIENT: And what was that?
THERAPIST: Focus on playing with your son and doing something happy when he comes over this afternoon. Which is hard to do with how you're feeling and worrying it won't go well. But I do think you'd get something out of it when it goes better. (Pause) And I think something similar is probably true with a lot of things. (Pause) We can probably finish up for now.
CLIENT: I had some weird stuff, I don't know.
THERAPIST: I think we're on for early this Thursday morning, rather than our usual Friday.
CLIENT: Okay, I did have that and there was something.
THERAPIST: Was that the weirdness you had in mind? [00:41:34]
CLIENT: Yes. I don't know why, I can't remember why we're doing it Thursday.
THERAPIST: No its me, I've got to be out again for Friday morning.
CLIENT: But also I wanted to change the 23<sup>rd</sup>, there's a networking event in Plymouth.
THERAPIST: That's next Friday?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Let's see, I could meet Wednesday at 10:45. I could meet at 7 in the morning on Friday, does that help you out? [00:42:56]
CLIENT: No, because I've got, that's basically when I've got to leave, going to have to go up to Plymouth. I mean Wednesday is wide open but I'd prefer to spread it out a little bit. Thursday is kind of nuts for me.
THERAPIST: Here we go, do you want to tentatively schedule the Wednesday and I'll see if I can figure out something else for the other day, which would be Friday, if Thursday is nuts for you.
CLIENT: What's that?<br />
<br />
 THERAPIST: Do you want to tentatively schedule the Wednesday and then if I can figure out something else for Friday?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Would later in the day on Friday work?<br />
<br />
 CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Okay.
<br />
 CLIENT: What time on Wednesday?<br />
<br />
 THERAPIST: 10:45.
CLIENT: At least now I know I can sleep later.
