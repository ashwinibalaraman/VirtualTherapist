BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: So I had my interview last week and I have a second interview on Thursday.
THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: That went well.
CLIENT: It did. Um...
THERAPIST: And the navigation was smooth enough...?
CLIENT: Well, we actually...she e-mailed me at noon, or a little earlier, and asked if we could reschedule because some of her staff couldn't even show up...
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: (nervous laugh)...so it just not the right day, which was totally okay with me. So we had it on Tuesday, um...
THERAPIST: So that gave you extra time to prepare and not have to worry about that extra logistic.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: That's good.
CLIENT: So, but for the interview Thursday I have...I have to complete this entire, um, design assignment before I even walk in the door, and then my interview is 3-1/2 hours' long with like 5 different people and then at the end I have a half hour of study time and then I have to present a sales pitch to the entire sales and marketing team.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh). So, and that's what I do...I love that sort of stuff...
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: ...but, um, but I mean it's still very nerve-wracking, so (nervous laugh), um, I'm more nervous for it than excited.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Yeah, that sounds like a stressful interview, but it's wonderful that you have the opportunity. [00:01:22]
CLIENT: Yeah, so, ya know I was talking to them in human resources and it's like down to just you and one other person at this point.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: And I go great, that's all I, ya know...thanks for telling me that. So, um, so that's that and I'm looking very forward to it. Um...
THERAPIST: You said it's Thursday?
CLIENT: Thursday at 11:15 and, um, yeah it's going to be a long day. And Wednesday is my dad's next court appearance.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Yeah, but I told...I was talking to my stepmother and my family and I asked that I don't want to speak to anyone until Thursday at 6 o'clock, and then you can call me, ya know. But I just don't want it to distract me or, so one of two things could happen. So now, um, he was in district court from up until now and now he's goes to superior court, so it's a new judge and I guess the first thing that they do is do a review of the bail. If the judge feels the bail was set high enough, then nothing will happen. If the judge says to raise it even a dollar then he'll go back to jail because my stepmother has announced that she will not take out another bond for him, so, um, so then he'll be in jail for...until his next date which no one knows when that will be. So, probably sometime in May. Um, or even June at this point cuz it's...so that's that. (nervous laugh) Um...
THERAPIST: And is that the only thing getting reviewed at this...[ 00:03:20]
CLIENT: Well, he'll be...
THERAPIST: ...time, or?
CLIENT: ...he'll be officially indicted for his charges...or not...but he will. Um, and that's all that's happening I guess.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: So, um...
THERAPIST: And is this the typical process to move from district to...?
CLIENT: I guess so.
THERAPIST: I have...
CLIENT: I have no idea...
THERAPIST: That's not my area of expertise.
CLIENT: ...yeah. I mean I'm learning as I go along, but um (pause) I don't know why they made the switch. I don't know what the...um, but...I mean to me going to superior court means it's a lot more serious than if you were in a...
THERAPIST: It sounds serious.
CLIENT: Yeah, well...
THERAPIST: But I don't know what it means.
CLIENT: I don't either (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: If it's just part of the process or...
CLIENT: Um, and I talked to my stepmother last night and her and my brother and sister are all now, um, in counseling with different therapists.
THERAPIST: Oh, that's wonderful. [00:04:30]
CLIENT: Mm hmm, so I guess she talked...she's been talking to um, ya know, their school people once a week since this all happened and, um, one of them - I don't know which oneâ€”just said how important it was that they really have an outside, ya know...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...place and nonbias who they can talk to. That she feels like my stepmother is not being as open with them as she should be. So I, so, um, and ya know she's not protecting them in any way by trying to hide these things. They are well aware of what's going on, yeah. So...
THERAPIST: Well, especially your sister is old enough...
CLIENT: Yeah. Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...to be getting information from other sources.
CLIENT: So, um, they started last week was their first week, all of them, so...
THERAPIST: They're all with separate people or they...
CLIENT: With separate people, separate counselors, but it's all in the same sort of office.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:05:25]
CLIENT: Um, and I don't know why they did it that way except...
THERAPIST: Well, it makes sense that they're all seeing someone separate.
CLIENT: Separate.
THERAPIST: Cuz usually one therapist doesn't usually see multiple family members unless it's family therapy.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Together, yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, because that allows you to feel like you really do have...and especially with kids cuz kids don't have the same level of confidentiality that adults have.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: I think your sister might be old enough that she qualifies as an adult...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...for clinical purposes but your younger brother doesn't.
CLIENT: Yeah. Um (sigh), what else happened? Um, trying to think. I'm exhausted. So, it's been a long week and I have a long week to come.
THERAPIST: You done with classes now?
CLIENT: No, I have, um...well this is my last week.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Um, but endless work between now and Friday, and some sleeping at work tonight. Tomorrow night I won't get out until like 8. Wednesday night is my only night I get out at 6:30, which is great. Thursday I probably won't be out till midnight, and then Friday probably like 5. So, it's gonna be a long...
THERAPIST: Long, long days.
CLIENT: Yeah, mm hmm. Um, oh, I can't even think about it...and then plus homework. But I think I'm going to tell them that I have one more week of school after this so I will get out...will be...will get out of work at like 2 on Monday and Wednesday, which is a little white lie I need to (nervous laugh)...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Well, you have exams...
CLIENT: Well, this is my...
THERAPIST: ...that you'll be studying for.
CLIENT: ...this isn't...
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: ...yeah. So, um I do a lot of studying this weekend. I still have one project that I have to find time to do but it's due on Wednesday, so I don't know when I'm gonna have time to do it, but I'll make it work. Um, and then after that pretty much I can make it till the weekend and then, um, I have two other projects due like a week from today, so I can finish those over the weekend. I hope (nervous laugh) and then I'm done. (inaudible at 00:08:12).
THERAPIST: How do you feel about finishing?
CLIENT: Well, it was really kind of...there's no light at the end of the tunnel quite yet.
THERAPIST: (chuckle)
CLIENT: I'm somewhere lost in the dark (nervous laugh) but by the end of the week I think I'll be excited. Um...
THERAPIST: You don't really have time to process what it means to be done...[ 00:08:34]
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: ...because there's so much...so much piled up at the end. Especially with interviewing at the same time (inaudible at 00:08:45)
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: ...to get your head prepared for that.
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm trying to do...ya know I know the marketing side of it, but the interior design side is not...I have always been interested just in my own home but it's not something I know the field, ya know, so I'm trying to learn all of this stuff like so quickly, um, so...just trying to balance my homework, ya know, that I have to get done with, ya know, this preparing for this interview.
THERAPIST: Right. Which feels really important.
CLIENT: Which is, yeah.
THERAPIST: And you only have one shot.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, and so I won't be...so I'm sleeping over tonight. It's like going to work after here. Then I have class until 9, and then I'm going back to work and then...
THERAPIST: Are you able to get work done or sleep while you're there that late?
CLIENT: Um, not really. Um...
THERAPIST: And you said there's one that gets up.
CLIENT: Yeah. And then so...and then tomorrow morning I have to go to my internship and then back to work, so I won't be home until Tuesday at like 7. (breathes) (nervous laugh) Um, lots of coffee. (pause) And (pause) ahh...my mom was diagnosed with glaucoma.
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: Yeah, um, but it runs in our family and she was thinking that she was...ya know it's in totally early stages and ya know you just take the drops or something and, ya know, it should slow down the process or whatever, but, um, but yeah, my grandfather has it. I can't see anything (nervous laugh), um...my grandmother has it too, and, but she doesn't seem to...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It's not like a...you just take drops and then ya know...
THERAPIST: Yeah, there's some treatment...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and if it gets more advanced there are some treatments too.
CLIENT: Yeah, but, um...
THERAPIST: Yeah, so you never really want to (inaudible at 00:10:58)...
CLIENT: I know (yawn).
THERAPIST: ...with that. It's hard to take that in. [00:11:02]
CLIENT: Mm hmm. She was like "I'm officially old!" (nervous laugh) Um...
THERAPIST: But she's young for glaucoma.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: But with the family history I guess.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah, she's 53. My grandfather has it really bad and he...oh, I mean he didn't...he had it probably when he was in his 50s. He's in his 80s now and he never had it treated until he had to have major eye surgery. He can't see anything.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: It's an incentive for your mom to...
CLIENT: Oh yeah (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: ...do the earlier stages of treatment...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...prolong the course as long as possible, and for you to have regular checkups?
CLIENT: Yes. (nervous laugh) Uh (pause) or...I got into an argument with my roommate because (sigh) Saturday night a second person at 4 in the morning came strolling into my bedroom.
THERAPIST: Oh my goodness.
CLIENT: Two weekends in a row, so I...
THERAPIST: The same individual?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Or another person?
CLIENT: No, another person. A new guy, so at 4 in the morning I, ya know, I'm a really light sleeper anyway, but I hear our door open.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: On the front door we have an alarm system. It's an alarm it goes beep beep, ya know, the door opens, so...but I didn't... you're half asleep, ya know and I didn't think about what time it was and then, so he like walked all the way down our hallway past my door, like then come back up the hallway. Like they looked like they were lost or ya know looking for something. And, I was thinking it was our roommate because the door was open, ya know...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:12:50]
CLIENT: ...to somebody without a key. So I'm lying there and then I hear our bedroom door and then I'm like okay...and it was pitch black in our room and then I see a like a flashlight or a...it was a cell phone light. So I sit up and I'm like hello, and the kid like I startled him I think and so he walks back out in the hallway and I get up and so I'm standing in front of the front door and I turn on the lights so I can see who it was, and it was just this...he's like "Ah, I'm looking for Jack." I'm like "no Jack lives here." "I know he doesn't." And he takes out his cell phone and like tries to call someone. Like, "there is no Jack here and you need to leave." But I was in a much meaner voice than this.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And, um, and so I opened up the door and he proceeded to leave, but...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...so I locked the door and, um, and then in the morning we had, Kyle and I had gotten home at like midnight and then a bunch of our roommates had gotten home I don't know maybe 1 or 2 and left the door unlocked, and I don't know who this person was. No one...I described him and no one knew who he was. It was probably just someone from off the street, ya know. Or someone looking for people upstairs and came into our apartment, so...I was not happy.
THERAPIST: That's really scary. [00:14:20]
CLIENT: Second person in two weekends (nervous laugh), um...
THERAPIST: You think your point about, ya know, your roommates not locking the door and not being careful is, ya know, obviously true.
CLIENT: Yeah, so...
THERAPIST: And you're lucky that this was just...ya know that he wasn't harmful, but it's so scary...
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: ...to have someone wander into your bedroom at night.
CLIENT: Yeah. So...and I was like trying to signal for Kyle to wake up (nervous laugh) but he was completely asleep, um...I know, um, one of them is moving out today for the summer, thank God. So we'll have one less person, but, and they were also apologetic because I was clearly upset, ya know, that um...
THERAPIST: Well, I think it's a pretty standard response to be a little upset.
CLIENT: Yeah, um...
THERAPIST: Was anyone else...were they concerned? Like was it upsetting to them that a random person would wander into the apartment in the middle of the night?
CLIENT: No. And this same night, um, a girl from upstairs laptop got stolen, so...and I told her about this person but I couldn't...like she was already home by then. She thinks it happened earlier in the night. Um (pause) but (pause) they...I don't think that...I mean they were not...they just said sorry.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Ya know, they were sorry that they didn't lock the door behind them. Ya know, that was about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, they don't seem to grasp...
CLIENT: Yeah, they all locked...
THERAPIST: ...the gravity of it. [00:15:55]
CLIENT: Yeah, so...
THERAPIST: Do you have a bedroom door that...like can you lock your own bedroom door?
CLIENT: We can lock our bedroom door, which is what I'm....like I'm...will be doing that. Last weekend after that person left and I locked the door I didn't think this was going to happen two weekends (nervous laugh) in a row.
THERAPIST: Of course.
CLIENT: So, from now on...
THERAPIST: I think with the warmer weather and school being close to out...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and schedules changing...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...I think, ya know, this is the time of year when parties increase...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and people have, ya know...ya know people don't wander around the streets in the winter because, because it's cold.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: But I think you're a little bit more susceptible to this kind of thing this time of year because of graduation and...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...finishing school and, ya know, you're in an area with so many students, that some extra...whatever extra precaution you can take and...
CLIENT: Yeah. So I will be locking our bedroom door too.
THERAPIST: Yes, protects you a little bit more.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know, I was not happy. Um...
THERAPIST: Has it impacted your anxiety at night subsequent to that?
CLIENT: Well, the first time I like couldn't sleep the rest of the night, um, and then this week no, it didn't because I didn't think it was going to happen again (nervous laugh), ya know? Um, but then of course...ya know after they left I was like up the rest of the, ya know, (inaudible at 00:17:27) and I was just so astonished that this happened again.
THERAPIST: Right. You know after an incident like that...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...your adrenalin is up because you've been startled...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and I would imagine you were feeling angry and that's a really hard feeling to let go of and relax and go to sleep again. [00:17:40]
CLIENT: Yeah. And last night, um, I fell asleep fine, um, but then at like 3, 4 um I was thinking about this project. Ya know like when your sleeping but you're not sleeping.
THERAPIST: Mm, your brain is functioning.
CLIENT: Yeah, so and then all of a sudden my alarm went off and I was like really? (nervous laugh) So, um...
THERAPIST: I haven't fallen asleep yet.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're not getting into deep sleep...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...cuz there's different stages of sleep and you're...the brain activity in each stage is a little bit different, and it sounds like if you're feeling like you're still thinking and your mind is still running, you're in a much...it's the long, slow brain waves of really deep sleep...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...ya know, it feels different than those more...much more active...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...stages that you're probably getting to on those nights when you feel like you're thinking all night.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Ya know our concept of time when we're asleep is really off...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...so it's very possible that you're, although it feels like you're thinking about stuff all night, you're not actually...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...but clearly you're waking up and you're not rested and so you're not getting those deep wave restorative sections of sleep that you really need.
CLIENT: I know. I wish at this point like I wish I'd have got up and started working on it at like 4 in the morning, ya know, because I'm sure the sleep I got was better than nothing, but...
THERAPIST: But it's not...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...it's not ideal. [00:19:14]
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You might not want to...not necessarily a good idea to get up and start working on it.
CLIENT: (nervous laugh)
THERAPIST: But if your laying in bed and you're not really sleeping, getting up and reading something like reading, ya know, reading a fluffy magazine or...
CLIENT: Oh, that's an idea.
THERAPIST: ...to...that might help you to relax, get your mind off of what you're concerned about...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and allow you to actually fall asleep and get a couple, ya know, maybe you would have gotten a couple hours of good sleep...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...leaving you a little bit more refreshed to tackle stuff during the day.
CLIENT: And what I found helps so far is I always have like a piece of paper and...or a notepad and pen by my bed and I write lists of the things I have to do.
THERAPIST: I think that's a great idea.
CLIENT: That's what my mom does because she has a terrible time sleeping if, ya know, thinking of the things for the next day or the week and so that's what she does basically every night. And so I've been starting to do that, which...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's a great technique because one of the things that's keeping you...keeping you writing those lists in your head is anxiety. [00:20:11]
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You don't want to forget an idea that you come up with for your project...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...or, ya know you have a day where your doubling going from work to school back to work to, ya know, to interview...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...to, ya know, you're running through that list so you don't forget where you need to be when...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and if you write that stuff down it lets you know it's there.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You can relax a little bit and not feel like you have to work to keep all that stuff in memory.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And that can help you kind of let go of it, does writing that stuff down and then distracting yourself with something easy. [00:20:40]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Um, you know filling your head with something more relaxing and less work.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's a good idea. (sigh). Just can't wait for next Monday. It'll feel like a big relief. Yeah. But I hired a tutor. Did I tell you that?
THERAPIST: Oh, no.
CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: I knew it was something you were interested in doing.
CLIENT: Yeah, I did. Because of aside from complaining about how busy I am, I cannot not be busy. It just doesn't work for me. So, I decided that...so she's going to start when I get back from (inaudible at 00:21:21) so the first week in, um, June...last week of my first week in June. And we'll meet once a week for an hour and a half and then, ya know, she'll give me my assignments for the week.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: What is your level now?
CLIENT: Zero.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I can say one through seven (nervous laugh). Um, so, but I mean I just...I want to learn a language. I don't know why I decided this over (inaudible at 00:21:48) Spanish or Mandarin, but I just...I like it, so (nervous laugh) that's my...
THERAPIST: It's a perfectly useful language, especially in design.
CLIENT: Mm hmm, yes. Um, so I'm excited to start that.
THERAPIST: I'll be a good thing to let them know about.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Have you told them...
CLIENT: I haven't...
THERAPIST: ...that you're willing to be bilingual
CLIENT: Mm hmm (nervous laugh). So my goal is one year to be like proficient...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...in another language, ya know. So, and if I get this job...
THERAPIST: Yeah, if you can immerse yourself in it, that's totally doable.
CLIENT: Um, so if I get this job I'll be going to...in the next I'll get to go to Milan, Paris, London, Miami and New York.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yup.
THERAPIST: That's a lot of travel. [00:22:36]
CLIENT: Mm hmm. So, I mean they're quick weekend trips for, um, for trade shows and things, so...but I mean fine with me. (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: That's a lot more travel than you're been able to have...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...so that would be wonderful exposure.
CLIENT: But I just have to get through it first to be able to do that (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. So what went right about the first interview?
CLIENT: Well...
THERAPIST: Building your confidence is really important.
CLIENT: Um, so I went in there with applying for this design internship. Uh, so my first interview was with the head of human resources. So halfway through our interview she goes, ya know, like don't, don't I don't want to consider you for the internship any more. I want...what would you think if I offered you, um, a position in the buying department, a more senior position. And I was like okay (nervous laugh), so I'm not even applying for the internship. It's now this retail position. So, um, that was the first thing that, ya know, went right, so, um, but then after that I was still scheduled to meet with this supervisor and, um... manager. And I met with her, and although a very nice person it seemed that she just didn't...she didn't even seem like she liked her job.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So, um, so I'm actually relieved...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...that I'm not. Cuz I don't think I would accept, but then I wouldn't want to...well, it doesn't matter anyway, because I'm not being considered for the position, but, um, so then after that I had, um, just like a 5-minute meeting with, um, two of the...one of the head curators in buying and one of the buyers. It wasn't scheduled or anything.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It was just since I now being considered for the position she wanted me to meet them quickly. Um, now Thursday I'm going back and having a formal interview with them. So, I mean this first interview was very, ya know, traditional, standard questions, but I have a feeling that they're gonna be asking me a lot of design questions.
THERAPIST: Something that could be a lot more in-depth...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...this next round. Has there been time, or is there any time for you to do a little bit of research on the company and figure out like what exactly these people do and who they are?
CLIENT: I have been. I did all last, last weekend and I mean they're all...they've all been in the industry for, ya know, 25 years...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...and they...three of them worked for a design magazine in editing and...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...and one is the chief operator still of, um, a design center.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And, um, one is a professor at Harvard and, ya know (nervous laugh)...and doing something in architecture and I'm like oh my God! (nervous laugh) So, um, and the my last meeting is with the owner and creator of the company for 15 minutes I get to speak to them.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So (deep breath), um, nervous is an understatement (nervous laugh). Uh, but I...public speaking is something that I seriously enjoy, ya know, so, um...
THERAPIST: Once your, once you get going and you're in your element.
CLIENT: Yeah. And nerves, ya know, through, ya know, doing public speaking in public a lot, um, you learn to channel your nerves...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...into positive energy, so, and look forward to butterflies (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: Well, clearly they liked you and that's, ya know, a huge chunk of it...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...is just being, I mean those five-minute-just-to-meet-you type of things are to make, ya know...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...the only thing you get out of that is to see if they kind of like your personality.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Um, because there's not much they get to know when you do a kind of fly-by like that, and so you've clearly passed that hurdle...
CLIENT: (sigh)
THERAPIST: ...because you were really likeable and obviously they thought you had a lot more knowledge than what would it would be for that internship position. [00:27:10]
CLIENT: Yeah (sniffs), so (pause) ya know, so I'm kind of like oh I wish it was tomorrow. Like, ya know. And then I'm also like oh my God! I don't even have enough time to be adequately prepared for, but like I said, it will be fine, ya know. (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Um, but it's just the worst feeling being unprepared, ya know, and not feeling like you're fully prepared. (sigh) But (pause)...
THERAPIST: What do you think you would need to feel fully prepared?
CLIENT: A year.
THERAPIST: Of?
CLIENT: design immersion (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: (Laugh)
CLIENT: No, realistically, if I...now until Thursday is plenty of time.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But it is on top of my, ya know, my school work is where I'm finding the problem.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Ya know, if I didn't have four projects and an exam at the end of the week, then fine. Ya know, but I'm just to balance out the time I do have...
THERAPIST: Against the time you have to spend on those.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well you just need to pass your courses to graduate.
CLIENT: I know (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: It's horrible, horrible thoughts, but...
CLIENT: I know (nervous laugh). I know.
THERAPIST: I know you've done really well up until now. You don't really want to crash and burn at the end, but you just need your diploma.
CLIENT: (nervous laugh) So, (whispers): I know. This is like so awful, but I was thinking like if I just didn't pass the exam, but would my grades be (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: I think you do need to...
CLIENT: Actually I would still pass according to what the...
THERAPIST: Are you allowed to not finish projects and still pass the course?
CLIENT: No, no (nervous laugh). Um, I know. But they're not even like these in-depth...ya know, they're actually...if this were a different semester I would be flying through everything, ya know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:29:13]
CLIENT: Um, they're just, ya know, sort of reviews of the semester.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I have one research paper that normally I would get done in a night and, ya know, but...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...this is just like the worst possible timing for like having this at all. I don't know. And I'm just putting them off and...
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well, I mean preparing for the interview...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...is, is...it's like having another class.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's the one you want to do really well in.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. But I can't work there if I don't graduate so (nervous laugh)...
THERAPIST: So you have to do your projects so that you can...
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You have to do them adequately, but they don't need to be the best projects you're ever done.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You have to kind of find the line of what's a good job...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...that is in keeping with, ya know, how well you've done...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...but shave a little time off that so put toward this other project that's also really, really important.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so tonight I have to submit my project for my interview, um, which it's an hour and a half timed, um...so I don't even really what it entails because I can't...
THERAPIST: You can't open it until...
CLIENT: ...once you open it, yeah.
THERAPIST: You have...so you can't do anything for that until you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...until you're ready to sit down and do it.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. So, yup. Um, but, ya know, I mean now they're like it's totally fine! You're gonna love it! Ya know. It's just to see your style and like you don't understand.
THERAPIST: (Laugh)
CLIENT: That is not how I'm looking at this. So, um (pause)...
THERAPIST: It's a very competitive market out there. [00:31:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) So, I know when we meet next week things could be...things will be completely different.
THERAPIST: That's what you said last week.
CLIENT: (laugh) Oh my God! Well it will be.
THERAPIST: Cuz you didn't know what the outcome of that interview would be, but it was...
CLIENT: But by next Monday I should have...I will have everything done and then...
THERAPIST: You may still be waiting to hear.
CLIENT: Yeah, mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Because they make take...you don't know when the other candidate is doing her...given her stuff.
CLIENT: I think actually same day as me.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: Um, because...
THERAPIST: And they deliberate on Friday. Get you answers by Monday.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Let's hope.
THERAPIST: Maybe.
CLIENT: But I know they're all...the entire buying staff is, um, flying to Houston on Friday. That's why they had to meet with me, um (pause)...they weren't, they weren't all going to be in the office at the same time until mid May, so...because this is, um...
THERAPIST: Getting ready for fall? Summer?
CLIENT: Yeah. Fall. Um...
THERAPIST: That's crazy.
CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh). So (pause) um, so we had...so I, um...and that she...the only time they had was starting at 11:15, so I think the girl...I think it's a girl...um, is going from 9 to 11. I'm 11:15 to whenever. (sigh) But who knows, there also could not be another person and they're just telling me this (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: You can only focus on yourself...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and what you need, ya know, doing whatever you can do to tell confident and secure and...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...cuz you have no control over whether there is another person or whether there's actually three to people or really just one other person. You have no control over that. You only have control over how you present.
CLIENT: Yeah. Now I'm getting all nervous about it (nervous laugh). (pause) I just really hope I get the job at this point, but I don't want to get my hopes up, because there's also...I mean the fact that I haven't even graduated yetâ€”they told me last week that I would never have been considered for the position if, ya know...not because I'm...no at this point they love me and they're thinking, ya know, but, um, if they had just seen my resume and seen, ya know...
THERAPIST: They wouldn't have put it in the right pile.
CLIENT: It's just...yeah. Um, so that could be a factor and so (pause) (sigh) I don't know.
THERAPIST: You made it through that piece by getting in the door...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...that's what so important about networking.
CLIENT: Mm hmm (pause) I just really hope I get it. But can't get my hopes up quite yet. And next weekend...actually Tuesday's my last day at my internship and then, um, next, um Saturday is like our big event that I've been promoting this whole time. Um, it's also Kyle's birthday, so we're gonna celebrate on Sunday. Um...actually as of next...two weeks from now, um, do you have any open times Tuesday mornings?
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: We can talk about this later too.
THERAPIST: That's okay. While we're thinking of it...
CLIENT: (nervous laugh)
THERAPIST: ...um, I will have open times Tuesday mornings starting in May.
CLIENT: Okay, that's fine.
THERAPIST: Um, May...
CLIENT: Oh, wait. I have to...if I have this job...
THERAPIST: We'll have to figure out what...
CLIENT: We'll have to figure out, yeah.
THERAPIST: When would your job start?
CLIENT: At...yeah.
THERAPIST: So I actually starting May 21st I have a lot more flexibility in my schedule than what I have now.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So we'll see what happens with your job and we...I'll have...move around. I work, um...in addition to my work here I work at Yale like a couple of months out of the year.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: And that ends May 18th...
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: ...so I get all sort of like my freedom and flexibility back after that.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So there will be plenty...there may be a couple weeks in between where we have to finagle but...
CLIENT: That's fine. Um, I may have to (pause) change my...
THERAPIST: But you may actually be away for your trip between two, so...
CLIENT: Yes. I'll be gone only one Monday. We leave the 18th. Is that a Saturday?
THERAPIST: It's a Friday.
CLIENT: Friday. So we leave the 19th, Saturday, and then we're back the next Saturday.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So that Monday I won't be here, um (pause)...only a couple more weeks (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: So what happens with your nanny job?
CLIENT: Well, um, I mean I've told them since I first started a year ago that, ya know, come my graduation...
THERAPIST: Then you were done?
CLIENT: Yeah. So, um, and yeah I've told them about my interviews and, ya know, so...
THERAPIST: And so they're prepared for you to be...
CLIENT: Very. But I don't quite think that they're...you know they should be interviewing at this point.
THERAPIST: Yes (laughs). [00:36:49]
CLIENT: And they're not. And I've offered to, ya know, start doing that for them, and she's just kinda like oh, we'll figure it out, but...
THERAPIST: Having separation anxiety?
CLIENT: Yeah, but I mean I've already confirmed...I've already made plans with them for doing sleepovers in June, so, ya know, I'll get out of work and then I'll have to go there.
THERAPIST: For times that they're away.
CLIENT: For, um...yeah for times that they're away, or and then, ya know, her mother-in-law who lives close will take her during the day, and they go to Vermont the entire month of July and half of August, so...and they'll have a, um, part-time baby sitter who they hire for the summer down there.
THERAPIST: Mm. Okay, and so they wouldn't be counting on you to...
CLIENT: ...to travel, no. Um, I think they would if I was going to be staying around.
THERAPIST: But they have...
CLIENT: Already made, mm hmm. So I think she's just not worried about because just get through June...
THERAPIST: Right. And then they are kinda gone for the summer.
CLIENT: Yeah, and then they'll have to hire again in September. Um...
THERAPIST: Ya know, it's just important for you to...it's sounds like you've done a really good job of prepping them.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Um, but it's understandable that they're having some separation anxiety.
CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: And they may try to, ya know, kind of get some additional weeks out of you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...or time and for you to be able to really hold firm on your boundaries so that you don't feel...
CLIENT: Mm hmm. But the good thing is...
THERAPIST: ...have to juggle too many things.
CLIENT: Exactly. But I've been so open with them through the, ya know...
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you've don't everything you possibly can on your part. I can see them saying sorry about that and they'd be like well! Yeah, we didn't really get anybody, so can you do this weekend?
CLIENT: Yeah. But the only thing is like you...it's not like a normal job. Ya know, I'll miss these kids.
THERAPIST: Of course you will. [00:38:44]
CLIENT: Ya know, so, and I still want to have, ya know, some time with them.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Well, I think that's partly what makes it to so hard.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Cuz you have such a personal connection.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: It's not like...it's, ya know...it is not a dry...
CLIENT: Yeah. And, I know.
THERAPIST: It also makes it a lot harder even when you don't really have the time to say no to doing it right after work or...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...it makes it a lot more difficult because you do have such a personal connection...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...to the kids in the family.
CLIENT: Yeah. So (pause) but I'm excited to have...to be out of work at 5 most of the time, ya know, and having the weekends off.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: There's so many cool perks to this job too that, um, once a week you get an additional paid hour of work to do, um, a yoga class which is offered on the 42nd floor of the building. Um, they pay 85 percent of your gym membership, whatever membership you want. Um, every 7 weeks you get a paid day of volunteer time. They'll pay you for volunteer work if you want.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Um, so like you get equity in the company. You...there's a lot of cool perks. Um, but I still don't know what the pay is, so (nervous laugh)...
THERAPIST: (Chuckles) Those are really nice benefits, though. Ya know stuff like that folds into whatever the salary is.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. And the office is unbelievable. The view alone is like incredible. It's probably one of the best office views I've ever seen. All the way on the top floor. Um...
THERAPIST: It's inspiring.
CLIENT: Yeah. There's ping pong tables in the office. Like it's just...it's like that Google sort of...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...inspired, ya know, office set up.
THERAPIST: They want you to want to be there. [00:40:56]
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, (pause) um, so...I don't know. I just hope...
THERAPIST: I hope it goes well for you. It'll be nice to have some, ya know, some good outcomes after the year that you've had.
CLIENT: And I'll really be able to enjoy my vacation knowing that I have a job.
THERAPIST: That would be a much...yeah, it would be a much different feeling to go away and feel settled about something...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and having something really nice to look forward to.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. And it'll be nice when, ya know, my family's here for my graduation and they're all asking (nervous laugh)...
THERAPIST: And you'll have answers to those questions.
CLIENT: Yeah (nervous laugh).
THERAPIST: To be excited about what you're saying.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: That'll be a really nice feeling.
CLIENT: (Sigh). Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: It's gonna be challenging to kind of set aside, ya know, even though I know you set a boundary with your family not to talk to you about what happens on Wednesday...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...it's gonna be hard to set that aside and...
CLIENT: I know, but it just...
THERAPIST: ...not think about it.
CLIENT: I'm sure it'll be on the news again and all that (inaudible at 00:42:10). I just can't...
THERAPIST: You don't have to turn on the news.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I think that's, ya know, probably a really good strategy is to be really strict with yourself about what sites you go online...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and there's...you don't have to turn on the TV.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You don't have to turn on the radio, and, ya know, playing music you can listen to that you can be assured that you're not gonna hear any news tidbits in between...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...um, to kind of protect yourself from that distraction and from...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and then you can process those things on Friday.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah. And by Wednesday I'm going to be so...I have so much to think about and do that I'm hoping...
THERAPIST: You need to focus on.
CLIENT: ...I won't even have time to, um, I don't know. But it's really at this point with all the school work, my interview, work he's...this whole thing is probably like fifth on my concerns list, so (nervous laugh), um, which I think is a good thing. I just (nervous laugh)...
THERAPIST: It's putting yourself as a priority...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...which is, ya know, as I was getting to know you and hearing kind of the role that you play in taking care of everybody else...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...letting yourself rise to the first...beginning of that list...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...is perfectly appropriate at a time like this. There's a lot of, a lot of things that are really important going on in your life...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and putting what you need first in order to accomplish some of those is perfectly appropriate and at some other time, ya know, making that, um, kind of vacillate a little bit more.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: So that you're not always putting yourself last...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and, but, ya know, kind of determining who needs to be first right now.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And sometimes it will be you, sometimes it might be taking care of your siblings, sometimes someone else...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...but it needs to be flexible...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...and it's okay. It's sounds like it had been a little inflexible. You had not been at the top of that list...
CLIENT: (nervous laugh)
THERAPIST: ...for a really long time.
CLIENT: Yeah. Actually, now that you say that (pause) yeah! (nervous laugh)
THERAPIST: This is our time. [00:44:15]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're finishing school. It's a huge deal.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You're interviewing for positions. You get to take care of you first.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: You can even ask people to help.
CLIENT: (nervous laugh). I have gotten a ton of help, ya know, from...either from this woman who's the one...actually I was over there last night and we had dinner together and, um, so she's been just...I had a 4-hour crash course...
THERAPIST: Awesome.
CLIENT: ...in design, which is great, and (pause) but it's just like not nearly enough (nervous laugh). I need to spend like so much more time, but she has been a humongous help.
THERAPIST: That's awesome.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And I bet you're absorbing a lot that you'll be able to, ya know, kind of show off in the interview.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Yeah. And I wish I could just like take her brain like...
THERAPIST: (Laugh) Just borrow it for a couple hours.
CLIENT: ...(nervous laugh) yeah.
THERAPIST: Well it sounds like she's giving you maybe the important pieces.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Ya know you can only convey so much information in 3 hours anyway.
CLIENT: That's true, mm hmm.
THERAPIST: What you're showing them is your willingness to learn...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...show off a few buzz words...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and give them a taste of what you actually can bring to the job.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And then, ya know...even if you knew a year's worth of stuff you couldn't tell them a year's worth of stuff in 3 hours.
CLIENT: That's very true.
THERAPIST: And so tell them the most important things that makes it sound like you have...
CLIENT: (nervous laugh)
THERAPIST: ...a year's worth of knowledge backing it up. That's part of sales and marketing.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. I can BS my way through it (nervous laugh). Um, I know...but then if I get the job I have like so much more research incentive to do...
THERAPIST: Well, then you can do it.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Because I actually do need to know those things.
THERAPIST: For now the job is just to get them to buy the product.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: You can fill in all the other stuff. [00:46:15]
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Oh my God...it's gonna be a long day.
THERAPIST: Lots of deep breathing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Keep yourself focused and present as you're getting through all your stuff.
CLIENT: (sigh) Focused and present. I have to be more present (pause) always looking, ya know.
THERAPIST: It's hard when you have so many things that you're juggling.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Trying to be right where you are for one moment and then later be in the next thing.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: That keeps...helps to keep the anxiety down because when you're actually present in the moment doing what you're doing you tend not to be anxious about it. It's when you're in one moment thinking about the 7 other moments that you need to be in later that you start to feel anxiety. So if you can keep your lists like you've been doing at night...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...and keep those with you and then let yourself be in one place at a time. Be exactly where you are, where you need to be and then you'll move to the next thing. Why don't we stop there for today. So regular time next week?
CLIENT: Yes, mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And then (inaudible at 00:47:19) job we'll move where we need to.
