I was born in Haifa, Israel, on December 28, 1937,
and received my undergraduate education in Israel,
coming to the United States for my graduate education
in 1966. My entire career as an academic professional
has been in Philadelphia, first at Temple
University, then at the Medical College of Pennsylvania,
and since 1998, at the Department of Psychiatry at the
University of Pennsylvania Medical School. In 1979,
I founded the Center for the Treatment and Study
of Anxiety, where, with the collaboration of many

<b>EARLY INFLUENCES
AND EDUCATION HISTORY</b>


I was drawn to psychology as an adolescent, when
I discovered the writings of Sigmund Freud and
became fascinated with psychoanalysis. After graduating
from high school, I went to a Normal School
to train to work with delinquent children. My teacher
of psychology there was a trained psychoanalyst who
encouraged me to write my final thesis on the Freudian
explanation of childhood delinquency.


After working 2 years in a boarding school for
delinquent children, I continued to study psychology
at Bar Ilan University, where I received my BA in
1962. At Bar Ilan, my clinical psychology teachers
all represented psychoanalytical or psychodynamic
orientations; none of them thought that psychotherapy
can or should be studied empirically. However, in Bar
Ilan, I was also exposed to research in experimental
and social psychology and became extremely interested
both in the science of psychology and in empirical
research. This interest was fostered by my late
husband, Uriel G. Foa, who was then the chair of
the department of psychology and a distinguished
researcher in social psychology.


My first contact with behavior therapy and behavior
modification occurred at the University of Illinois,
where I received my MA in 1970, under the supervision
of O. H. Mowrer. In the 60s, the clinical program
in the Department of Psychology at Urbana was one
of the strongholds of behavior therapy and modification;
their faculty included Leonard Ullmann,
Leonard Krazner, and Gordon Paul, to name only a
few. There, I first become acquainted with the work
of Joseph Wolpe and with the integration of experimental
psychology concepts into psychopathology
and treatment. The educational experience at the
University of Illinois together with Uriel Foa's mentoring
in research methodology marked the beginning
of my professional career.


After completing my PhD in 1970, at the
University of Missouri at Columbia, I was awarded a
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) postdoctoral
fellowship to work with Wolpe at Temple
University, the mecca of behavior therapy at the time.
There, I had the opportunity to meet leaders in the
field, many of whom influenced my conceptual and
empirical work. Of particular importance for me was
the influence of Peter Lang and Stanley Rachman.


<b>PROFESSIONAL MODELS</b>


At the University of Illinois, I was introduced not only
to behavior modification and behavior therapy but
also to the clinician-researcher model; and it is this
model that is reflected in the development of my own
career. I began my research examining the efficacy of
behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders and identifying
the active processes involved in these treatments.
I soon discovered the limitations of behavior
therapy: Not all patients were helped, and many remain
quite symptomatic. This realization motivated me to
examine the failures more carefully. Consequently, I
embarked on an inquiry into treatment processes that
distinguish patients who benefit from behavior therapy
from those who do not. This led me to editing a
book titled <i>Failures in Behavior Therapy</i> (1983),
designed to draw attention to exploring variables that
predict success and failure in behavior therapy.


Pursing this line, I extended my interest from the
study of treatment processes to the study of what it is
that treatment should correct. Hence, I have been conducting
studies that aim to elucidate the mechanisms
involved in pathological fear and anxiety. Thus, my
work emphasizes the relationship between three areas
of research: therapy outcome, therapy processes, and
psychopathology. Most recently, and continuing in the
spirit of the clinician-researcher model, I have been
much concerned with disseminating the effective
treatment that my colleagues and I have developed for
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and by means of lectures,
workshops, and also by systematic study of the
efficacy of these treatments in the hands of clinicians
in community-based clinics, who are not experts in
cognitive behavior therapy.


<b>MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD</b>


Most of my academic activity has been concerned with
research on the psychopathology and treatment of the
anxiety disorders, primarily OCD, PTSD, social phobia,
and to a lesser degree, panic disorder with agoraphobia,
as well as specific phobia. This research has been theoretically
driven so that my theory has informed the
direction of research, and the empirical findings have, in
turn, led to further development of the theory.

<b>Theoretical Work</b>


My interest in the psychopathology and treatment
of anxiety has produced a number of theoretical
papers that are widely cited. Perhaps the best known
is "Emotional Processing of Fear: Exposure to
Corrective Information," which develops a theory on
the processes involved in pathological anxiety and
its treatment. Emotional processing theory conceives
the anxiety disorders as reflecting distinct pathological
fear structures that include associations among
representations of the feared stimuli, the feared
responses, and their meaning. Accordingly, the goal
of treatment for any given anxiety disorder is to form
a modified structure in which the stimuli are the
same as in the original structure, but the pathological
elements have been corrected. Successful therapy
achieves this goal by activating the pathological
structure and, at the same time, introducing corrective
information that can be incorporated into the
modified structure.


<b>Treatment Outcome Studies</b>


In a series of studies, I have been developing and
systematically investigating the active ingredients of
exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) for OCD. At
the same time, I have been investigating the efficacy of
various medications, both alone and together with
cognitive behavior therapy, in ameliorating OCD symptoms.
These studies have helped to provide the knowledge
of how to conduct cognitive behavior therapy for
OCD and how to combine such therapy with medication.
The treatment program that emerged from this
research has been disseminated to therapists and clients
via treatment manuals and even more widely disseminated
via a self-help book entitled <i>Stop Obsessing</i>. As
chair of the <i>DSM-IV</i> Subcommittee for OCD, I also had
the opportunity to incorporate empirical research findings
into the diagnostic criteria of OCD.


Since 1983, I have been studying PTSD, pursuing
both outcome studies and psychopathology research.
As in the earlier work in OCD, my colleagues and I
have been developing and systematically studying several
different short-term cognitive-behavioral treatment
programs for PTSD. This research was summarized in
a book presenting the theory and practice of cognitive
behavior therapy for PTSD, titled <i>Treating the Trauma
of Rape: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for PTSD</i>. The
influence of these studies on the field has been such that
the treatment program we have developed, known as
<i>prolonged exposure</i>, is considered by many experts to
be the treatment of choice for PTSD. In 2002, this treatment
was recognized by an award from Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMSHA) as a model treatment to be targeted for
dissemination among clinicians.


<b>Treatment Processes Research</b>


As a complement to my interest in developing
effective treatments for pathological anxiety, I have
been systematically concerned with understanding
the processes that make the treatment work. In this
endeavor, I was first influenced by conditioning
theory and later on by the theoretical framework of
information processing. For example, in several studies,
we found that patients who fail to show fear activation
during exposure to their feared situation or
memory (where fear is measured by self-report, physiological
responses, and facial expressions) and who
fail to habituate between sessions do not benefit from
treatment as much as those who do. Other process
variables that I found to influence treatment outcome
for PTSD include organization of the trauma narrative
during repeated reliving of the trauma and changes in
the schemas of "world" and "self."


<b>Psychopathology Research</b>


In investigating mechanisms underlying pathological
anxiety, I have been concerned with applying
methods of experimental psychology to clinical
research, as well as carrying out more descriptive
psychopathology studies. Specifically, I have used a
variety of cognitive experimental methods (e.g.,
dichotic listening, emotional stroop) in order to
elucidate information-processing biases that characterize
the anxiety disorders. In studying the psychopathology
of these disorders, I have developed a
number of measures of OCD and PTSD severity. My
self-report measure of PTSD, the Posttraumatic
Diagnostic Scale (PDS), is being widely used around
the world.


<b>CURRENT WORKS AND VIEWS</b>


I continue to conduct research on OCD, PTSD, and
social phobia. In OCD, my colleagues and I are currently
studying the augmentation effects of exposure

<b>FUTURE PLANS</b>


My future research will continue to emphasize the
relationship between therapy outcomes and its dissemination,
therapy processes, and psychopathology.
Within this framework, together with my junior
colleagues, I am embarking on new projects, which
include (a) developing treatment for PTSD related to
abuse by partners; this treatment will focus on helping
women to access psychological and environmental
resources as they attempt to leave their abusive partners;
(b) exploring programs for maximizing remission
from PTSD; and (c) conducting experiments to
study how to change cognitive biases (e.g., attentional,
interpretation) in social phobia, in order to develop
new paradigms for treating this disorder.
