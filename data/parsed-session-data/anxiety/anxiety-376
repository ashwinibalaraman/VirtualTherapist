Type 2 diabetes (DM2) is a chronic
illness characterized by a dysregulation
of glucose metabolism secondary to
an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and
insulin secretion. An estimated 11 million
people in the United States were diagnosed
with diabetes in the year 2000 (Boyle et al.,
2001), and approximately 90% of those
individuals were diagnosed with DM2. The
number of individuals diagnosed with DM2
has been rising at an alarming rate over the
past several decades (Harris, 1998). It has
been estimated that this figure will increase by
165% to 29 million by the year 2050, reflecting
a 7.2% prevalence rate. Such an increase
is hypothesized to be the result of changes in
demographic composition of the population,
population growth, and increasing prevalence
rates (Boyle et al., 2001).


Personal and public health consequences
associated with DM2 are profound. For
example, individuals with diabetes experience
a greater number of health complications
(Harris, 1998) and are at higher risk for depression
than are their medically well counterparts
(Anderson, Freeland, Clouse, &amp; Lustman,
2001). On a more global scale, the economic
impact of diabetes is staggering; in 1997, the
direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes
in the United States were an estimated
$98 billion (Ray, Thamer, Gardner, &amp; Chan,
1998). Thus, the increasing prevalence of diabetes
in the United States represents a critical
public health problem with respect to health
care use and resources.


Fortunately, DM2 is medically manageable,
and many of the serious medical complications
that are associated with the illness are
preventable through adequate control of
blood, glucose levels. Therefore, the primary
treatment goal for individuals with DM2 is to
maintain blood glucose levels within a normal
range. This requires individuals with diabetes
to consistently maintain a complicated, lifelong
treatment regimen with few immediate
tangible rewards for their efforts. For many,
maintaining this complex treatment regimen is
difficult, and assistance with disease management
is often warranted. As such, researchers
and. the medical community have recognized

The purpose of this chapter is to review the
psychosocial aspects and behavioral management
of DM2. First, information regarding
the nature of the illness, including etiology and
complications, is reviewed. Then, psychological
factors and symptomatology commonly
associated with DM2 are presented. Next, the
assessment and treatment of the medical and
psychological aspects of DM2 are discussed,
including a review of psychosocial interventions
focused, on improving global adjustment
to diabetes. It should be noted that there are
a number of studies reviewed here that used
combined samples of individuals with type 1
and type 2 diabetes. Where possible, information
specific to DM2 is presented and indicated
as such.

<b>Background and Etiology</b>

There are two primary types of diabetes: type
1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes (often referred to
in the past as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus) occurs when the
islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed and
cannot produce insulin. Consequently, exogenous
insulin is required for survival. In contrast,
DM2 is characterized by chronic
hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin secretion
and increased insulin resistance in the
body's cells. Insulin resistance refers to a defect
in glucose transport and metabolism. As a
result, glucose does not enter the body's cells
where it can be used as fuel, and subsequently,
a higher level of glucose remains in the blood-stream.
Early in the course of DM2, the pancreas
attempts to counteract the high levels of
blood glucose by producing increased amounts
of insulin. However, because of the sustained
need for high amounts of insulin over long
periods of time, the pancreas gradually loses its
ability to produce sufficient amounts of insulin
and so can no longer maintain euglycemia, that
is, near-normal glucose levels (DeFronzo,
Bonadonna, &amp; Ferrannini, 1992).


<i>
<b>Short-Term Complications</b>
</i>


Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are two
short-term complications that result from
DM2. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood
glucose declines to less than 60 milligrams per
deciliter (mg/dl). Symptoms include shakiness,
perspiration, rapid heartbeat, hunger, headache,
mood changes, confusion, and attentional
difficulties. If hypoglycemia is left untreated,
seizures or loss of consciousness may eventually
occur. Conversely, hyperglycemia is defined as
a blood glucose level greater than 140 mg/dl.
Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent
urination, and glucose in the urine. The majority
of long-term complications associated with
DM2 are the result of recurrent hyperglycemia
(American Diabetes Association [ADA], 1998).


<i>
<b>Long-Term Complications</b>
</i>


Long-term complications can be classified
into two types: macrovascular and microvascular.
Macrovascular diseases include heart
disease, stroke, and other circulatory disorders.
The leading cause of diabetes-related
deaths is heart disease. Adults with diabetes
are two to four times more likely to die from
heart disease than are adults without diabetes
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases [NIDDK], 2000).
Individuals with DM2 are also at two to four
times greater risk for stroke than are their
medically well counterparts. Furthermore,
approximately 73% of adults with diabetes
have circulatory disorders (e.g., high blood
pressure), many of which require prescription
medications for hypertension (NIDDK, 2000).


Microvascular complications constitute
some of the most debilitating complications
associated with DM2. Microvascular

[p. <i>305</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00315&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Neuropathy (neuronal disease) is a common
microvascular complication affecting
approximately 60% to 70% of individuals
with mild to severe forms of nervous system
damage (NIDDK, 2000). Characteristic symptoms
include pain, numbing, burning, loss of
feeling, and (in more severe cases) paralysis in
the extremities. Neuropathy may also cause
digestive problems, impotence, and incontinence.
Severe forms of nerve damage are a
major cause of lower extremity amputations.


<i>
<b>Etiological Risk Factors</b>
</i>


<i>Demographic and Genetic Factors</i>. A
number of demographic and genetic factors are
associated with DM2, including age, race, prior
history of gestational diabetes, family history of
diabetes, and obesity. In terms of age, those
over age 45 years are at the highest risk for
developing DM2, and approximately 20% of
individuals over age 65 years have diabetes
(NIDDK, 2000). Similarly, differential rates of
DM2 are found among various ethnic groups.
For example, African Americans, Native
Americans, and Hispanic/Latino Americans
have demonstrably higher prevalence rates for
DM2 than do other ethnic groups (Harris,
1998). Furthermore, women who experience
gestational diabetes during one or more of their
pregnancies are at greater risk for developing
DM2 later in life than are women who do not
(NIDDK, 2000). Finally, those with a family
history of diabetes are also at heightened risk.
Indeed, first-degree relatives of individuals with
early-onset DM2 are 40% more likely to
develop diabetes than are individuals with no
family history of the disease (Owen, Ayers,
Corbett, &amp; Hattersley, 2002). Thus, there are a
number of demographic factors that are associated
with a heightened risk for DM2.


<i>Obesity</i>. The previously mentioned risk
factors can be mitigated by the most critical and
modifiable risk factor for DM2, that is, obesity.
It is estimated that up to 75% of the risk for
DM2 is directly attributable to obesity (Manson
&amp; Spelsberg, 1994). For example, Hillier and
Pedula (2001) demonstrated an inverse linear
relationship between the Body Mass Index
(weight in kilograms divided by height in
squared meters) and age at diagnosis of DM2.
In other words, those who are more overweight
are more likely to be diagnosed, with DM2 at a
younger age. Although the mechanisms responsible
for the relationship between weight and
DM2 are not entirely clear, recent evidence suggests
that body weight is associated with insulin
resistance and subsequently glycemic control
(Maggio &amp; Pi-Sunyer, 1997). Consequently, the
majority of DM2 prevention and intervention
programs target weight loss (for a review, see
Wing et al., 2001). Such weight loss efforts have
been shown to be effective in preventing the
onset of DM2 (Diabetes Prevention Program
Research Group [DPPRG], 2002). A primary
challenge for behavioral researchers and those at
risk for diabetes is to determine effective methods
to maintain long-term weight loss given that
it is well known that maintenance of weight loss
is difficult to achieve (Wing et al., 2001). In summary,
the most influential risk factor for DM2 is
also potentially the most modifiable.

<b>Psychological Factors and Type 2 Diabetes</b>

Individuals with DM2 constitute a population
at risk for experiencing both illness-related and
general distress. Many individuals experience
subclinical adjustment problems directly related
to living with diabetes, including distress
associated with the onset of diabetes, diabetes
complications, and the treatment regimen. Still
others experience clinically significant levels of
psychological distress, including depression and
anxiety. This section reviews both diabetes-specific
distress, as outlined by Rubin and
Peyrot (2001), and more general distress, such
as depression and anxiety.


<i>
<b>Distress Related to Diabetes Onset</b>
</i>


The diagnosis of diabetes represents a
period of crisis for many. Unfortunately, few
empirical studies have examined levels of distress
immediately following diagnosis of DM2
among adults. However, increased levels of
distress immediately following diagnosis is
common among children diagnosed with type
1 diabetes. For most, this distress then dissipates
over the first year following diagnosis
(Kovacs, Brent, Steinberg, Paulauskas, &amp; Reid,
1986). Thus, Rubin and Peyrot (1994) recommended
regular monitoring of patients' distress
levels following diagnosis. Individuals experiencing
clinically significant distress should be
referred for intervention as a means of minimizing
the impact on diabetes management.


<i>
<b>Distress Related to
Medical Complications</b>
</i>


The onset of medical complications can
trigger a crisis for many individuals, and health
care providers should not underestimate the
potential emotional impact of new complications.
However, research examining the impact
of specific diabetes complications is quite limited
and has primarily examined psychological
correlates of sexual dysfunction and visual
impairment. Sexual dysfunction is a prevalent
problem among men with diabetes; approximately
50% of men with diabetes experience
impotence. Although the prevalence of sexual
dysfunction is not known for women, one
study reported, that women with DM2
reported significantly lower levels of sexual
desire or orgasmic capacity, lubrication, and
sexual satisfaction in their relationships than
did nondiabetic control participants (Schreiner-Engel,
Schiavi, Vietorisz, &amp; Smith, 1987). To
date, little research has specifically examined
the treatment of impotence among those with
diabetes (McCulloch, Hosking, &amp; Tobert,
1986). As such, it has been recommended that
treatment for impotence proceed in accordance
with the standards established for medically
well individuals (Rubin &amp; Peyrot, 2001).


Visual impairment due to diabetic retinopathy
is another complication that appears
to have profound psychological consequences
for the patient. Individuals diagnosed with
progressive diabetic retinopathy (PDR)
reported a greater number of negative life
experiences and psychiatric distress during the
2 years following diagnosis with PDR (Wulsin
&amp; Jacobson, 1989; Wulsin, Jacobson, &amp;
Rand, 1987). Distress related to PDR appears
to be independent of the severity of vision loss
and remains elevated even after vision is
restored. (Wulsin &amp; Jacobson, 1989; Wulsin et
al., 1987). Moreover, individuals who experienced
fluctuating levels of visual impairment
experienced more distress than did those with
more stable and severe visual impairment
(Bernbaum, Alpert, &amp; Duckro, 1988).
Common feelings related to vision loss include
failure, uncertainty, and fear. Nevertheless,
few studies have examined interventions
to address the emotional consequences of
PDR onset (Bernbaum et al., 1988).
Therefore, it is recommended that clinicians
regularly assess psychological distress, especially
among patients who have been diagnosed
with PDR.

[p. <i>307</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00317&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


Little is currently known about the
psychological sequelae of other diabetes-specific
complications. However, it has been
demonstrated that the more complications a
person experiences, the more likely he or she is
to manifest psychological distress (Trief, Grant,
Elbert, &amp; Weinstock, 1998). Thus, health care
professionals should remain cognizant of the
psychological consequences of new or accruing
diabetes complications for their patients.


<i>
<b>Psychosocial Stress</b>
</i>


Stress, often conceptualized as the interaction
between an event and an individual's
response to that event, is one of the most
widely studied psychosocial factors associated
with DM2 (Goetsch &amp; Wiebe, 1995). It has
been hypothesized that stress affects metabolic
control both directly and indirectly (Peyrot &amp;
McMurry, 1985). First, stress is believed to
directly affect metabolic control through
physiological mechanisms. Theoretically, stress
triggers the natural physiological responses
("fight or flight" response), resulting in the
release of counterregulatory hormones. The
release of these hormones triggers an increase
in sympathetic activity to the pancreas, thereby
inhibiting insulin and stimulating the release
of glucagons (Goetsch &amp; Wiebe, 1995).
Glucagon then stimulates the liver to convert
glycogen to glucose and release hepatic glucose
stores into the bloodstream. As a result, there
can be increases in blood glucose levels independent
of consistent diabetic regimen
adherence. A number of animal models have
supported the link between acute stressors and
metabolic control (Kuhn, Cochrane, Feinglos,
&amp; Surwit, 1987; Surwit, Feinglos, Livingston,
Kuhn, &amp; McCubbin, 1984; Surwit et al.,
1986). However, generalization of these results
to humans has been difficult. Although some
studies have reported significant associations
between life stress and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>)
independent of regimen adherence among
adults with diabetes (Demmers, Neale,
Wensloff, Gronsman, &amp; Jaber, 1989), other
studies have not (Griffith, Field, &amp; Lustman,
1990). The equivocal findings are likely due
in part to the wide variety of methodologies
employed, including types of stressors targeted,
durations of the stressors, measures of subjective
stress, interval between the stressors and
the blood glucose tests, and baseline blood
glucose levels. Obviously, the relationship
between stress and blood glucose is a complex
one that involves multiple variables, including
cognitive and physiological factors.


Indirectly, stress is thought to adversely
influence metabolic control through changes
in self-management behaviors. The ability to
maintain the demands of a complex treatment
regimen may be compromised by the
demands of daily life (e.g., eating fast food
instead, of taking the time to prepare a proper
meal, skipping regular exercise to catch up
on work) (Marlatt &amp; Gordon, 1985). Future
research studies are needed to identify psychological
and physiological markers of individuals
who are more susceptible to stress
and to shed light on appropriate interventions.
Interventions that directly target stress,
such as relaxation training and stress management,
are discussed later in the chapter.


<i>
<b>Depression</b>
</i>


Empirical research indicates that depression
is quite prevalent among individuals with
diabetes. Meta-analytic data indicate that
approximately 31% of individuals with diabetes
report clinically elevated depressive
symptoms. Furthermore, the accrued lifetime
prevalence of major depression among individuals
with diabetes is estimated to be 28.5%
(Anderson et al., 2001). Similarly, Egede,
Zheng, and Simpson (2002) found that individuals
with diabetes (type 1 or type 2), when
compared, with a healthy control group, are
twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression.
Depressive episodes also tend to occur more
frequently and last longer among individuals

[p. <i>308</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00318&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The demonstrated association between
depression and diabetes provides the most
striking example of the interwoven relationship
between psychological functioning and
diabetes outcome. Depression is strongly associated
with metabolic control among individuals
with DM2 (Lustman et al., 2000). In their
meta-analysis, Lustman and colleagues (2000)
found that depression accounted for approximately
3% of the variance in glycated hemoglobin,
a salient finding given that a 1%
decrease in glycated hemoglobin results in a
33% decrease in the progression rate of
retinopathy (Morisaki et al., 1994). Furthermore,
treatment of depression could potentially
increase the proportion of individuals in
good glycemic control from 41% to 58% in
the diabetic population (Lustman et al., 2000).
Thus, psychological functioning has direct
implications for illness outcomes.


There also appears to be a relationship
between health care use and depressive
symptoms among patients with diabetes. For
example, individuals with depression and
diabetes had higher ambulatory care use (12
vs. 7 visits) and filled more prescriptions (43
vs. 21) than did their counterparts without a
diagnosis of depression. Among individuals
with diabetes, total health care expenditures
for individuals with depression and diabetes
were four and a half times higher than those
for individuals without depression ($247
million vs. $55 million) (Egede et al., 2002).


Despite the influence of depression on
DM2 outcome and health care use, two of
three cases of depression go undiagnosed.
Undiagnosed depression is likely due to the
fact that many of the symptoms for depression
and diabetes overlap (e.g., fatigue [Lustman
et al., 1997]). In fact, the prevalence of depressive
symptoms among those with diabetes argues
for the routine integration of screening for
mood disorders by primary health care
providers into their patients' treatment plans
as a means of improving their patients' psychological
and physical health.


<i>
<b>Anxiety</b>
</i>


As with depression, rates of anxiety are significantly
higher among individuals with
diabetes than among the general population.
In fact, rates of clinically significant anxiety
among those with diabetes may be as high as
49% (Peyrot &amp; Rubin, 1997). Gender, age,
and education were variables that predicted
greater anxiety symptoms (Peyrot &amp; Rubin,
1997). In particular, females, individuals
between ages 40 and 49 years, and individuals
with lower educational backgrounds were
more likely to report symptoms of anxiety.
Individuals who had more diabetes complications
also reported more anxiety symptoms.
Not surprisingly, 38% of those reporting anxiety
also reported, comorbid depression
(Peyrot &amp; Rubin, 1997). Thus, regular screening
for anxiety among patients with diabetes is
also recommended, especially among those
with a greater number of diabetes-related
complications.


<i>
<b>Other Psychosocial Factors</b>
</i>


<i>Social Support</i>. Social support has been associated
with physical and psychological health
among those with DM2. Individuals with DM2
who perceive more social support from friends
and family engage in more diabetes self-care
than do those who perceive less social support
(Garay-Sevilla et al., 1995; Peyrot, McMurry,
&amp; Davida, 1999). In fact, social support may
account for as much as 17% of the variance in
self-reported diabetes self-care behaviors (Wang
&amp; Fenske, 1996). Social support has also
been consistently associated with decreased

[p. <i>309</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00319&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Illness Intrusiveness</i>. Illness intrusiveness,
which refers to the perception of the extent to
which an illness constrains and disrupts
valued activities, has also been associated with
depressive symptoms among individuals with
diabetes (Devins, Hunsley, Mandin, Taub, &amp;
Paul, 1997). To illustrate, Talbot, Nouwen,
Gingras, Belanger, and Audet (1999) examined,
depressive symptoms in a sample of 237
individuals with DM2 cross-sectionally and
found that illness intrusiveness accounted for
61% of the variance in depressive symptoms.
Such findings suggest that individuals who
tend to perceive their diabetes as restricting
activities in valued domains (e.g., family, relationships,
spirituality) are at greater risk for
depression than are those who do not. To
date, relatively little research has been conducted
examining cognitive factors such as
intrusiveness and their relationship to depression
in the context of diabetes. Further
research is needed in this area to determine
whether these cognitive variables mediate the
relationship between diabetes and depression.


<i>Perceived Control</i>. Another cognitive
appraisal variable, perceived control, has also
been related to levels of psychological distress
among individuals with diabetes. Using a measure
of diabetes-specific control, Peyrot and
Rubin (1994) found that the type of locus of
control resulted in either positive or negative
health outcomes. Their work suggests that
there are two types of internal control:
autonomous and self-blaming. Autonomous
internal locus of control orientation (i.e., the
belief that a person can manage his or her illness)
was significantly associated with fewer
symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Conversely, a self-blaming internal locus of
control (i.e., the belief that a person is responsible
for his or her negative illness outcomes
such as poor metabolic control) was associated
with high blood glucose levels and binge
eating. In addition, participants who thought
that diabetes control was a matter of chance
or fate were more likely to be depressed and
anxious and to have lower self-esteem (Peyrot
&amp; Rubin, 1994). Certainly, more research is
needed to determine how perceived control
and health outcomes are causally related.
However, it appears that health-related
perceptions of control are important cognitive
mechanisms to assess and are potentially effective
targets for treatment.


<i>Coping Style</i>. The inconsistent findings
regarding the relationship between stress and
glycemic control may be partially due to differences
in how individuals cope with stress.
Stress has been significantly associated with
higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> values among those individuals
who reported "ineffective" coping styles (i.e.,
emotional or angry responses to stress) but
not among those who reported "effective"
coping styles (i.e., tendency to not respond
emotionally to stress) (Peyrot &amp; McMurry,
1992). Coping styles have also been directly
related to glycemic control. For example,
Peyrot and colleagues (1999) found that after
controlling for regimen adherence, individuals
with DM2 who reported, more pragmatic and
stoic coping styles showed better glycemic
control. Such findings suggest that changing
the manner in which individuals respond to
stressors may mitigate the impact that stress
has on glycemic control of those with DM2.


<i>Quality of Life</i>. Quality of life (QOL) is a
global construct that refers to health-related
physical and social functioning as well as

[p. <i>310</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00320&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because of the required changes in lifestyle
and rigid adherence to treatment regimens,
it is not surprising that perceived QOL is
affected. In fact, it has been demonstrated that
patients controlling their diabetes solely with
diet and exercise had fewer diabetes quality of
life (DQOL) assessed worries than did those
taking oral medications. Furthermore, those
taking oral medications reported more DQOL
satisfaction with treatment and less burden of
illness than did those taking insulin (Jacobson,
deGroot, &amp; Samson, 1994). It appears, then,
that certain components of an individual's
treatment regimen affect QOL. However,
findings on the relationship between glycemic
control and QOL are less clear. Although
some studies have found significant relationships
between DQOL and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (Trief et al.,
1998), others have not (Peterson, Lee, Young,
Newton, &amp; Doran, 1998).


<b>
<i>Ethnic and Cultural Considerations</i>
</b>


As stated previously, rates of DM2 are
clearly higher among some ethnic groups,
including African Americans, Native Americans,
and Hispanic Americans (Harris, 2001). Furthermore,
the frequency and severity of microvascular
complications are more common
among these minority groups than among
Caucasian populations (Cowie et al., 1989;
Franklin, Kahn, Baxter, Marshall, &amp;
Hamman, 1990; Harris, Klein, Cowie,
Rowland, &amp; Byrd-Holt, 1998; Resnick,
Valsania, &amp; Phillips, 1999). A number of
potential explanations have been posited to
account for these observed differences, including
decreased health care access, physiological
factors, and psychological factors. As an exemplar,
findings from a select number of studies
with African Americans are presented here.


A number of differences have been observed
in health-related beliefs, attitudes, and coping
styles. For instance, Samuel-Hodge and colleagues
(2000) found that African American
women reported that they often feel "nervous
and tired" and worry about diabetes complications.
Furthermore, many African American
women tend to respond to the needs of others
and neglect their own care in accordance with
their caretaking role within the family. Coping
methods may also substantially differ given
that African American women tend to rely on
spirituality and their belief in God to provide
the strength to cope with diabetes (Samuel-Hodge
et al., 2000). The aforementioned,
factors are just a few examples of potential
ethnic and cultural differences in psychological
adjustment and coping style that may exist and
so should be considered in treatment plan
development.


Unfortunately only a limited number of
studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions
designed for specific ethnic groups. The
few that have been conducted demonstrate
improvements in glycemic control, blood pressure
control (Agurs-Collins, Kumanyika, Ten
Have, &amp; Adams-Campbell, 1997), and weight
loss (Mayer-Davis et al., 2001). Such positive
outcomes underscore the importance of developing
culture-specific interventions The relevance
of these findings is also reflected in
culturally centered diabetes outreach programs
(e.g., African American, Native American,
Latino) recently developed by the ADA (2002b).

[p. <i>311</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00321&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


In the future, research is needed to determine
the culture-specific factors that contribute to
diabetes adjustment and effective interventions.
A complete review of the literature on culture
and DM2 deserves far more consideration than
can be achieved within the scope of this
chapter. However, it is strongly emphasized
that sociocultural factors must be considered
when intervening in the context of DM2.

<b>Assessment and Treatment</b>

<b>
<i>Primary Prevention: Risk Reduction</i>
</b>


The substantial role of modifiable risk
factors in the etiology of DM2 makes prevention
efforts a primary health care objective. The
majority of prevention efforts involve lifestyle
interventions, targeting factors such as
obesity, overeating, and physical inactivity. For
example, two recent large-scale prevention
studies highlight the critical role of behavioral
change in diabetes care. The first, the Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP), involved a multi-center
study of individuals at risk for diabetes
conducted by the National Institutes of Health
(Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group
[DPPRG], 1999). Participants were randomly
assigned to one of three groups, including a
drug intervention (metformin vs. placebo) or an
intensive lifestyle intervention. Participants
receiving the intensive lifestyle intervention
met for at least 16 sessions with case managers
trained in nutrition, exercise, and behavioral
modification over the first 24 weeks of the
study and monthly thereafter. The curriculum
consisted, of general information about diet and
exercise and behavioral interventions, including
self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control,
problem solving, and relapse prevention training.
Participants in the lifestyle intervention also
attended group courses that focused on exercise,
weight loss, and behavioral issues. Group
courses lasted. 4 to 6 weeks, with additional
optional groups offered quarterly. Those in the
drug intervention took metformin, which is
designed to promote glucose homeostasis, or
were administered a placebo. Overall, results
for the lifestyle intervention were promising
(DPPRG, 2000). At follow-up (average 2.8
years), the lifestyle intervention group demonstrated
a 58% reduction in diabetes development,
and the drug intervention demonstrated
a 31 % reduction in diabetes development, relative
to the placebo group (DPPRG, 2002).


Similar results were found in the Finnish
Diabetes Prevention Study (FDPS) (Tuomilehto
et al., 2001), which randomized 522 overweight
individuals with impaired glucose
tolerance to an intensive lifestyle intervention
(targeting weight loss, food intake, and physical
activity) or to a control group (brief diet and
exercise counseling). As in the DPP, Finnish
participants in the lifestyle intervention group
showed a 58% reduction in the incidence of
diabetes as compared with the control group.
Clearly, both the DPP and FDPS provide evidence
for the impact of influential changes in
eating and exercise habits on the development
of diabetes.


The robust findings of the two large-scale
prevention studies just described are reflected
in the ADA's 2002 position statement on
the prevention or delay of DM2. The ADA's
statement consists of recommendations for
health care providers to (a) increase patient
awareness of the benefits of modest weight
loss and regular exercise, (b) conduct regular
screenings on high-risk populations, and (c)
provide weight loss and exercise counseling
for those who are found to have impaired
glucose tolerance (ADA, 2002c). Although the
ADA's recommendations clearly acknowledge
the importance of lifestyle interventions in the
prevention of DM2, the feasibility of largescale
implementation of these interventions
may be problematic within the existing health
care system. For example, use of an effective
lifestyle intervention program requires a large
number of well-coordinated resources over an
extended, period of time. Often, such resources

<b>
<i>Medical Interventions</i>
</b>


To prevent diabetes-related complications,
individuals with DM2 must manage a complicated
treatment regimen on a daily basis.
Such treatment regimens are individualized
according to patients' medical needs and
resources. They typically consist of a nutritional
regimen, an exercise program, and oral
medication (NIDDK, 2000). Nutritional
plans generally consist of eating prescribed
proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrates
as well as fiber, cholesterol, and
sodium. It is also recommended that a regular
exercise plan involve aerobic and muscle-strengthening
exercises. For many individuals
with diabetes, changes in diet and exercise are
sufficient to achieve euglycemia (near-normal
glucose levels). However, if diet and exercise
cannot adequately sustain euglycemia, oral
medications that decrease blood, glucose are
incorporated into the treatment regimen.
Oral medications lower blood glucose either
by stimulating the pancreas to produce more
insulin or by increasing the efficiency of
insulin use. When oral medications are not
sufficient to maintain euglycemia, exogenous
insulin injections are integrated into the treatment
regimen. Nearly 40% of individuals
with DM2 are treated with insulin to improve
metabolic control. Clearly, the responsibility
for diabetes self-management rests on the
individual with diabetes. Therefore, the preceding
treatment regimens require a number
of substantial behavioral and lifestyle changes
for most individuals.


<i>Metabolic Control</i>. The fundamental purpose
of a diabetes treatment regimen is to
achieve near-normal metabolic control. Thus,
individuals with diabetes must frequently
self-monitor blood glucose. For individuals with
DM2, glucose levels should fall between 80 and
120 mg/dl before meals and between 100 and
140 mg/dl at bedtime (ADA, 1998). It is also
recommended that physicians check HbA<sub>1c</sub> regularly.
HbA<sub>1c</sub> is an average measure of blood
glucose for the previous 3 months and is an
important indicator of metabolic control.
Individuals who do not have diabetes typically
have an HbA<sub>1c</sub> percentage of less than 6%
(ADA, 1998). It is recommended that individuals
with DM2 maintain an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of between
7% and 8%. Diabetes-related complications are
greatly reduced though good metabolic control;
for every 0.9% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, the risk of
developing microvascular diabetic complications
(eye, kidney, and nerve disease) is reduced
by approximately 25% (ADA, 2002a).


<i>Preventive Screening of Diabetes Complications</i>.
Preventive screening and practices is
also a vital component of the diabetes treatment
regimen, particularly as it concerns
diabetes complications. As stated previously,
hypertension is common among individuals
with diabetes and so must be monitored
regularly. Adequate blood pressure control
can subsequently reduce cardiovascular disease,
such as heart disease and stroke, by
approximately 33% to 50% and can reduce
microvascular disease by approximately 33%
(NIDDK, 2000). Cholesterol and lipids must
also be monitored, among individuals with
DM2; cardiovascular complications can be
reduced by 20% to 50% through improved
control of cholesterol and lipids. Medications
are commonly required to control cholesterol
and blood pressure among those with
diabetes. In addition, preventive screenings for
diabetic eye disease are important. Early
detection and treatment of diabetic eye disease
with laser therapy can reduce the development
of severe vision loss by an estimated 50% to
60%. Similarly, early detection and treatment
of diabetic kidney disease can reduce the

[p. <i>313</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00323&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Difficulties With the Medical Regimen</i>.
There are a number of diabetes-related adjustment
problems that are directly associated
with attempts at treatment adherence. One
such frustration commonly expressed by individuals
with diabetes is the sense of being food
deprived (Rubin &amp; Peyrot, 2001). Some individuals
may subsequently develop poor eating
habits, whereas others report that they do
not monitor their glucose as often as indicated.
Adhering to monitoring glucose levels is
also problematic. Two commonly cited reasons
for not monitoring blood glucose are the
pain associated with drawing blood and the
inconvenience of monitoring in certain settings.
Still other individuals have negative responses
to excessively low or high blood glucose readings
(Rubin &amp; Peyrot, 2001). Motivation to
adhere to the monitoring portion of the treatment
regimen is difficult to maintain when the
feedback is often negative in nature.


An additional problem often encountered
by individuals with DM2 is the frustration
associated with unpredictable blood glucose
levels, often leading to less active self-care. To
help alleviate frustration, individuals are
encouraged to develop realistic standards and
expectations regarding diabetes outcomes.
Finally, the fear of taking insulin can prevent
optimal management of blood glucose levels.
Clinicians should attempt to identify specific
fears related to taking insulin, including the
pain associated with the injection, interference
with lifestyle, experiencing hypoglycemia,
and being treated differently by
others (Rubin &amp; Peyrot, 2001). For a more
thorough description of the fears related to
taking insulin, see Rubin and Peyrot (2001).


It is important to recognize that diabetes
self-management is a complex, multidimensional
construct. Typically, individuals are
adherent to certain components of their treatment
regimens but not to others. Indeed, perfect
adherence to every aspect of the treatment
regimen is extremely rare and (for many) unrealistic
(Wysocki &amp; Buckloh, 2002). Therefore,
clinicians should identify the components of
the treatment regimen to which patients are
adhering well and those to which they are not.
It is common for individuals frustrated with
one aspect of their treatment regimen to generalize
and conclude that they are "bad patients"
or are "nonadherent" patients. Clinicians can
help such individuals by identifying small
specific goals to work toward. Subsequently,
the treatment regimen will appear much more
manageable to individuals with DM2.


<i>Diabetes Self-Management Education</i>.
Diabetes self-management education (DSME)
equips individuals with the knowledge and
skills to manage their diabetes successfully.
Metabolic control is potentially optimized,
and future complications are minimized,
when the following information and skills are
taught: nutritional information, exercise
recommendations, self-monitoring of blood
glucose (SMBG), insulin administration, and
managing of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic
events. Given that patients perform
approximately 95% of this daily care independently
(Anderson, 1985), DSME is considered
to be the central component of the
medical treatment for those with diabetes.
Despite the central nature of DSME, only
40% of individuals with diabetes receive formal
diabetes management education (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services,
1998), and 50% to 80% of individuals have
severe deficits in their diabetes self-care
knowledge (Clement, `995). These estimates
indicate that many individuals do not receive
adequate DSME and suggest that the method
and delivery of DSME require improvement.

[p. <i>314</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00324&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


There is an extensive body of literature that
evaluates various methods of delivery and outcomes
related to DSME. Still, no particular
intervention method has been identified as
optimally efficacious. Because of the multidimensionality
of diabetes treatment regimens,
DSME interventions are differentially effective
depending on the aspects of the regimens that
are assessed (Norris, Engelgau, &amp; Narayan,
2001). In other words, interventions are
generally effective in changing certain outcomes
but not others. However, a recent
review article by Norris and colleagues (2001)
outlined several consistent findings that have
emerged from the DSME literature and are
summarized here.


Specifically, short-term DSME interventions
have been found to be fairly effective in yielding
improvements in knowledge levels, SMBG
skills, and dietary habits but not in yielding
improvements in weight loss and physical activity
levels (Norris et al., 2001). Group intervention
formats are effective in improving
knowledge and SMBG and may be more effective
than individual formats for lifestyle interventions.
However, it is important to note that
improvements in knowledge or SMBG do not
necessarily translate into improvements in
glycemic control. Notably, interactive, individualized,
repetitive interventions are more
effective in improving lipid levels than are
single-session or short-term interventions. In
addition, programs that promote patient
participation or take a collaborative approach
to instruction appear to be more effective than
didactic approaches in affecting outcomes such
as glycemic control, weight loss, and lipid profiles.
Finally, Norris and colleagues (2001) concluded
that, by and large, self-management
interventions that have consistent reinforcement
over long periods of time are more
effective than single-session or short-term
interventions.


Norris and colleagues (2001) also pointed out
limitations in the existing DSME literature. They
recognized that the dearth of research examining
psychological outcomes makes it quite difficult
to determine specific psychological factors
that influence self-management behaviors.
Furthermore, very few studies have reported.
long-term treatment outcomes. This is noteworthy
given that long-term follow-up studies are
less likely to find positive outcomes regarding
glycemic and behavioral outcomes than are
those with short-term follow-ups (Norris et al.,
2001). It may be that program interventions lead
to short-term behavioral change but that the
newly acquired behaviors do not necessarily
persist. Consequently, "refresher" sessions over
the course of the illness may be warranted. It is
unlikely that one intervention that improves all
self-management behaviors, and that is appropriate
throughout the course of the illness, will be
found. Therefore, future research needs to determine
which types of interventions, or combinations
of interventions, are most effective for
specific outcomes. Moreover, virtually no
research has examined how adherence changes
over time for adults with diabetes. Thus, longitudinal
studies are needed to determine whether
self-management behaviors follow a developmental
pattern.


<b>
<i>Psychological Interventions
for Diabetes-Specific Problems</i>
</b>


Over the past 20 years, behavioral interventions
for diabetes-specific problems have
shifted from knowledge- and education-based
interventions to patient-centered interventions
emphasizing patient efficacy, esteem, and control
(Glasgow et al., 1999). Patient-centered
interventions appear to be effective in improving
both physical and psychological health outcomes.
Three empirically supported examples
of patient-centered interventions--diabetes-specific
coping skills training, empowerment,
and stress management interventions--are
discussed here.


<i>Diabetes-Specific Coping Skills Training</i>.
Diabetes-specific coping skills training (DSCST)

[p. <i>315</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00325&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Empowerment</i>. Patient empowerment interventions
also appear to be effective in addressing
many of the diabetes-specific difficulties
that frequently accompany DM2. Empowerment
interventions are designed to enhance
goal setting, problem-solving, coping, stress
management, social support, and self-motivation.
Anderson and colleagues (1995) evaluated
an empowerment intervention that consisted of
six 2-hour group sessions. At a 6-month follow-up,
the treatment group demonstrated significant
increases in self-efficacy (setting goals,
solving problems, emotional coping, obtaining
support, self-motivation, and decision making)
and positive diabetes-specific attitudes as well
as decreases in negative diabetes-specific attitudes.
Small improvements were also observed
in glycemic control. This study lends further
support to the value of patient-centered care
that addresses the psychological aspects of
living with diabetes.


<i>Stress Management</i>. A number of stress
management interventions have been developed
based on the strong theoretical link
between stress and metabolic control. A variety
of techniques aimed at decreasing stress have
been evaluated, including biofeedback (Surwit
&amp; Feinglos, 1988), relaxation training (Surwit
et al., 2002), and cognitive-behavioral strategies
(Henry, Wilson, Bruce, Chisholm, &amp;
Rawling, 1997). For instance, studies examining
the efficacy of biofeedback-assisted relaxation
training found significant improvements
in various measures of metabolic control,
including improved glucose tolerance, reduced
long-term hyperglycemia (Lammers, Naliboff,
&amp; Straatmeyer, 1984; Surwit &amp; Feinglos,
1988; Surwit, Ross, McCaskill, &amp; Feinglos,
1989), postprandial (i.e., after eating) blood
glucose levels, and plasma Cortisol, as compared
with control participants (Surwit &amp;
Feinglos, 1983). Overall, stress management
interventions show improvements in metabolic
control parameters but have not been consistent
at reducing psychological distress (Henry
et al., 1997; Surwit et al., 2002). Future studies
need to determine whether some individuals
are more susceptible to the effects of stress than
are others and which types of interventions
effect specific stress-related outcomes.


<b>
<i>Technology-Based Interventions</i>
</b>


Currently, greater attention has been
directed toward developing cost-effective interventions
that can be easily disseminated. To this
end, Glasgow, Toobert, and Hampson (1996)
evaluated a brief office-based computer intervention
aimed at improving diabetes self-management.
Individuals in the intervention
completed a computerized, assessment of self-management
behaviors and then were provided
feedback on self-management, participated in
goal-setting exercises, and selected individualized
interventions. Participants also received a
one-page feedback form outlining individualized
obstacles to self-management. The

<b>
<i>Treating Psychological Distress</i>
</b>


As indicated previously, there is high
comorbidity between diabetes and psychological
distress, especially depression and anxiety.
Recommended treatment approaches for
depression and anxiety in the context of DM2
are reviewed here.


<i>Depression</i>. Despite the high prevalence of
clinically significant depressive symptoms
among individuals with diabetes, few treatment
outcome studies have been conducted.
A notable exception is Lustman and colleagues'
1998 study, which compared the
efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
plus self-management training with that of
self-management training alone in decreasing
depressive symptoms among individuals
with diabetes (Lustman, Griffith, Freeland,
Kissel, &amp; Clouse, 1998). Remission of depression
was observed at a 10-week follow-up; at
that time, 85% of those in the CBT group
had remitted as compared with 25% of those
in the self-management group. Moreover,
treatment effects persisted; at the 6-month
follow-up, the rates of depression remission
were 70% for the CBT group and 33% for
the self-management group. The CBT group
also showed greater improvements in
glycemic control than did the self-management
group. Thus, CBT appears to be an effective
treatment for depression for those with
diabetes (Lustman et al., 1998).


Although CBT has been shown to be effective
in treating depression, the combination of
behavioral interventions with antidepressant
medication may be clinically indicated in some
cases. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
such as fluoxitine are effective in treating
depressive symptoms and are associated with
improvements in glycemic control (Rubin &amp;
Peyrot, 1994). Furthermore, fewer than 10% of
patients with diabetes taking fluoxitine experience
significant side effects (Lustman et al.,
2000). Tricyclic medications have also
been shown to decrease depressive symptoms
(Turkinton, 1980); however, the use of tricyclic
medication among those with DM2 has been
associated with adverse side effects, including
hyperglycemia, weight gain, orthostatic
hypotension, and other cardiovascular events
(Lustman, Griffith, Gavard, &amp; Clouse, 1992).


Although the treatments for depression
just described appear to be effective, the constellation
of organic and psychosocial factors
contributing to depression among those with
diabetes may well be unique. Therefore,
researchers and clinicians should not assume
that the research findings in medically well
populations generalize to those with diabetes.
Future research should focus on how
cognitive processing mechanisms interface
with diabetes-specific experiences and subsequently
influence psychological distress.
During the interim, it is recommended that
clinicians use treatments for depression that
are empirically supported among medically
well populations (e.g., CBT, interpersonal
therapy). Such interventions might be tailored,
to diabetes by including the identification
and modification of thoughts and beliefs
related to DM2 (for a review of empirically
supported, treatments, see also DeRubeis &amp;
Crits-Christoph, 1998).

[p. <i>318</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00328&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


<i>Anxiety</i>. As mentioned previously, anxiety
symptoms are also common among individuals
with DM2 (Peyrot &amp; Rubin, 1997).
Remarkably, no validated, randomized controlled
trials have evaluated the efficacy of
behavioral treatment interventions targeting
anxiety among those with diabetes. A number
of authors have suggested that biofeedback-assisted
relaxation training (described earlier
in the chapter), although not yet empirically
tested, to target anxiety symptoms, may be an
effective treatment for anxiety among those
with diabetes. At this time, it is recommended
that clinicians use treatments for anxiety that
have been empirically supported among medically
well populations (for a review of empirically
supported treatments, see DeRubeis &amp;
Crits-Christoph, 1998).


Studies examining the effectiveness of
pharmacological treatments for anxiety
among those with DM2 are limited. However,
initial reports suggest that pharmacological
treatments may be potentially effective
(Lustman et al., 1995). For example, individuals
treated with alprazolam (Xanax) displayed
improvements in glycemic control
when taking this medication regardless of a
formal diagnosis of anxiety (Lustman et al.,
1995). Although results are promising, further
research is needed to determine the most
effective treatment approach for anxiety
symptoms in individuals with diabetes.


Most individuals with diabetes seeking
psychological services will likely have both
general distress (e.g., depression) and diabetes-specific
issues. When treating clients with
poor regimen adherence and high levels of
psychological distress, it may be difficult to
determine the initial target of intervention.
In the majority of cases, it may be advisable
to address general distress first (Rubin, 2000)
because it is unlikely that individuals experiencing
high levels of distress are going to
have the organizational ability or motivation
necessary to effect diabetes-specific behavioral
changes. As levels of general psychological
distress decrease, diabetes-specific issues
can be addressed more effectively.

<b>Conclusions</b>

DM2 is a chronic illness characterized by a
dysregulation of blood glucose levels. DM2
requires individuals to manage a complex
treatment regimen so as to prevent severe medical
complications. Fortunately, it is a potentially
manageable disease, and many of the
negative physical and psychological health
sequelae are preventable. However, preventing

[p. <i>319</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00329&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although great progress has been made in
understanding the behavioral aspects of DM2
during the past two decades, a number of areas
are in need of further investigation. First, there
are virtually no longitudinal studies examining
the developmental course of self-management
among adults. Furthermore, additional research
should address the cultural-specific impact of
DM2. Not only are certain cultural groups at
high risk for DM2, but research suggests that
there also are potential culture-specific patterns
of illness appraisal and coping strategies. In
addition, studies that will help to determine the
most effective treatments for clinically significant
psychological distress among individuals
with diabetes, specifically depression and anxiety,
are warranted.


During the coming decade, there will be an
increasing need for cost-effective interventions
aimed at preventing and treating obesity and
DM2. An exceptional review by Wing and
colleagues (2001) advocated the need for
public policy and community-based interventions,
citing the role of environmental factors
in the development and prevention of obesity
and DM2. High-fat, high-calorie foods and
sedentary activities, such as watching television
and using computers, pervade contemporary
society and shape health-related behaviors and
outcomes. Thus, studies are needed to further
delineate which environmental variables influence
eating and physical activity and to
develop community-based interventions that
promote positive health behaviors.


Importantly, the development of more
cost-effective interventions will also require
the role of behavioral scientists to change
(Gonder-Frederick et al., 2002). Rather than
providing direct care, behavioral scientists will
increasingly provide training and supervision
to other health care professionals who directly
assess and implement behavioral interventions.
As a result, behavioral scientists will
also be required to further examine the role of
the provider-patient relationship in influencing
psychological and physical outcomes and
to develop interventions targeting health care
providers accordingly. In sum, the fundamental
challenge for behavioral scientists will be to
translate available findings into feasible, cost-effective
interventions that can be widely disseminated
to psychologists and health care
professionals (Gonder-Frederick et al., 2002).

<b>Case Study</b>

To illustrate the potential role of psychology in optimizing both physical and psychological
outcomes, the following case study is presented. In this particular case,
the individual has a number of diabetes-specific problems as well as clinically significant
psychological distress.


"A. J.," a 51-year-old male, presented to a diabetes clinic with a 6-year history
of DM2. Since being diagnosed with diabetes, he had closely adhered to his medication
regimen but inconsistently practiced dietary and exercise recommendations.
Thus, A. J. was still able to maintain an acceptable (but not optimal) level of glucose
control throughout the first few years of his illness. However, during the past
year, A. J. had gained 30 pounds and his HbA<sub>1c</sub> value had risen to 10.5%. In addition,
a recent examination by his family physician revealed an ulcer on his left foot.
Concerned by the rapid decline in A. J.'s metabolic control, the physician incorporated
insulin into his treatment plan and referred him to a health psychologist to
facilitate his regimen adherence.


During initial therapy sessions, A. J. admitted to having difficulty in adhering to
his treatment regimen, citing large Sunday dinners when traditional family recipes
high in fat and carbohydrates were served. He stated that he refused to miss out on
this special family time by declining to eat or eating off of a different menu.
Furthermore, he admitted that it was easier to ignore the problem than to change
his lifestyle. He stated that his exercise regimen consisted solely of playing with his
kids on the weekends and doing yard work.


In the third session, A. J. revealed that he had been laid off from his position at a
local computer company approximately 4 months earlier. He stated that after he was
laid off, he did not feel like playing with his kids anymore, found it difficult to get up
in the morning, and felt hopeless about the future. He also reported that his wife had
been nagging him more about "everything," including his diet, completing chores
around the house, and being "grouchy." Like many clients that are referred to
therapy, A. J. reported both diabetes-specific problems and general psychological distress.
After a thorough assessment, he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.


Given A. J.'s presentation, the focus of therapy shifted from diabetes-specific problems
to treating depression. A. J. was referred to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation
and was subsequently prescribed antidepressant medication. Psychological
treatment consisted of CBT in which A. J. explored his beliefs related to himself, losing
his job, and the difficulty in finding employment. When appropriate, beliefs
related to having diabetes were also explored, and where indicated, A. J.'s beliefs
were challenged and modified. Pleasant events scheduling was also conducted. After
3 months of CBT and medication therapy, A. J.'s symptoms of depression had
decreased substantially and he reported increased motivation to improve his diabetes
management. Thus, a long-term treatment plan was implemented consisting of
monthly meetings with the health psychologist to discuss issues surrounding weight

As a result of his efforts, A. J. lost 20 pounds and did not develop any additional
diabetes complications. He also reported that he felt more confident in his ability
to manage his diabetes successfully.
