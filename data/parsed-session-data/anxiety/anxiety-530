<b>DR:</b>	So, um, [PATIENT NAME], what were you doing in PE today?  Playing hockey, with what kind of sticks?  Plastic?
<b>PT:</b>	I think they're plastic.
<b>DR:</b>	Inside you were playing?  Wow.  Where were you playing?
<b>PT:</b>	In the PE room.
<b>DR:</b>	In the what room?
<b>PT:</b>	The PE room.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, is it a big room?  When we were in high school when it was raining they had to think of things for us to do.  One of the things was giving us little sticks like little golf sticks I guess with a metal handle but a hard plastic piece and putting, I don't know, twenty kids in a wrestling room.  Oh my god, every time you'd swing it you'd hear two thwacks, one hitting this plastic puck and the other one the stick hitting someone because there was no room to move anywhere.  It was, it's, I'm sure it's much more civilized now.  Was it fun?  Sounds like it was fun.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Hey, yay.  That's always good.  Um, all right, so let me find something here.  Um, uh, last time we talked about going to bed a little easier.
<b>CG:</b>	He was doing great and I think I, completely set myself up, what do you call it, [INAUDIBLE], but, uh, [INAUDIBLE] 'cause, um, he [INAUDIBLE] fantastic to having a very [INAUDIBLE] time going to school and the mentality sort of thing and getting over anxious about a couple of things that were going on.  Um, that we were having some pretty big meltdowns [INAUDIBLE] going to school.  And we have really [INAUDIBLE] late for school and we had the option of last Tuesday was of, uh, that we had to drive his sister to school one way or the other, that we were bringing his backpack so we could go and talk to somebody and it's like [INAUDIBLE] talk to about what was going on, um, with some suggestions of, you know, guidance counselors [INAUDIBLE] teachers, his regular classroom teacher.  [INAUDIBLE] you have to go in the door and talk to somebody about what's going on, why do you feel as you do about going to school.  And he picks the guidance counselor.  We went to her office and she talked to us for a little bit, but then she needed to go to actually his older sister's classroom for a guidance lesson, so she walked us down to the classroom and he started backing away when we got close to the door and she went in and got the teacher out and the teacher tried to talk to him about coming in, couldn't convince him and said why don't we go find his [INAUDIBLE] teacher and we found her.
<b>DR:</b>	His what?
<b>CG:</b>	His [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	And, uh, find her and we got her and she sat and talked to him about what he was a little worried about his AR tests they do, where they have to read the book like two times and then they take a computerized test on the book.  Plus there was an ancient Egypt play that was going on and he was supposed to be the mummy for it and—
<b>PT:</b>	I was okay with that.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, you were okay in the end, that was good.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I was okay the whole time.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you have any lines as a mummy?
<b>CG:</b>	He gave those up because we thought that was going to be, it was too much when we first found out about the play and then we found out about the costume and that seemed to be an issue at first, but then that afternoon I went back at like one o'clock and we sat together and watched the play so he could see what was supposed to be happening.  In the middle of it it was a little chaotic cause there was over 100 second grade kids doing the play altogether [INAUDIBLE].  So it was a bit chaotic for being in the middle of it and figuring out what am I really supposed to do.  So we thought taking him outside of it and watching it for when the whole thing through and the second time through he participated and it was good.
<b>DR:</b>	He did?
<b>CG:</b>	And he participated today and the thing and did it with school and then he did it again that night.  And the parents and the grandparents, which was great.  It was like there was a lot of things that he was mentioning that were, yeah.  And, um, the family isolated each individual thing.  There was no issue.  It was the anxiety leading up to it that seems to be the issue.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I mean, there was a lot of little issues.  I mean, not, I mean, a lot of—
<b>CG:</b>	Plus, he was in odyssey of the mind.  He actually participated.  But it was great because his team members, um, the couple of days before when they were having [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, did they do like a play?
<b>CG:</b>	We were having [INAUDIBLE] on the coffee table in the living room and stuff like that and he had to go [INAUDIBLE] didn't have to, so I [INAUDIBLE] that much stress we don't need to do that.  You need to talk to me though in a way that is constructive without tearing apart the house.  And, um, so he opted not to go because the day of it, um, he went ahead and went with the intention of all he needed to do was just be there.  He didn't feel up to participating.  It was too loud or it was too crazy for him to cope with, that's fine, he could just sit.
<b>PT:</b>	No, dad didn't even do that.
<b>CG:</b>	I know.  Well, dad ended up needing to take him because sister decided to projectile vomit the night before.  So I was up to three a.m.  With her and my husband [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Cleaning the walls and.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, it was lovely.  And they had eaten a lot of pizza that night.
<b>DR:</b>	Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Second grade.  My grandfather died, my dog died, and I was having a bad time and I was crying I might get sick.  I had the greatest second grade teacher.  I went up to her desk one time and told her I felt sick and threw up on her planning book and all the workbooks that she was grading.  Oh my god.  Oh, and she was very nice to me.  I mean, oh my god, I think it wasn't 'til later that I realized like how I think she probably still thinks about me.  She's probably like this old grandmother now, I had this student, so that is, yeah, but I didn't have to stay there.  You had to clean all that stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I got to clean it, including two drawers and every t—shirt they owned was covered including the outfit she was supposed to be wearing for odyssey of the mind the next day.  It was from the bed straight across to the other wall.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Like feet, six feet?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, oh, try more like ten.  She's got a big, got a—
<b>DR:</b>	What the heck was wrong with, I mean, that's not usual?
<b>CG:</b>	I have no clue.
<b>DR:</b>	What'd the doctor say?
<b>CG:</b>	By the time I could get an appointment to take her in she was fine.  So there was nothing to, they had no idea.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, that's bizarre.  That's usually some major.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, well, she told me that, her stomach was hurting when she came home from odyssey of the mind practice and she continued to have dinner with four pieces of pizza and then was laying around and talking to me and put her to bed.  At midnight she found her dad downstairs watching TV and was, her hair and her clothes and, dad, I got sick.  And then he walked upstairs and trying to be nice and thinking that he'd take care of it and saw it from the headboard, the pillow, the comforter, across the floor, into the drawer that was on the ground, into the dresser, down to the thing.
<b>DR:</b>	You sure she wasn't like mad at you and got up and threw up in all these different places?
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	That's, oh, poor thing.  That's.
<b>CG:</b>	So yeah, and she was—
<b>DR:</b>	And they wouldn't see you the next day?
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Like they don't have sick hours?
<b>CG:</b>	But everybody's sick right now is the catch twenty two.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but if you vomit ten feet.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  So, um, we dealt with that and [NAME OTHER] took them and [NAME OTHER] ended up having to go with [INAUDIBLE] which is his good friend's mom who was their team captain.
<b>DR:</b>	So he was going to go and just watch?
<b>CG:</b>	He was going to go watch but the team was so excited that he cheered up because he hadn't been to the practices recently, but, um, they were really excited and he decided to go ahead and join in.  And we had told the, um, if you had anybody with special considerations to keep in mind let them know ahead of time so we did.  And, um, they allowed for, um, teammates to help if he got stuck where normally you wouldn't have that.  And so there was one spot I heard where he got a little stuck.  They helped him out with that and—
<b>DR:</b>	Was that good?
<b>CG:</b>	And, uh, they did really well and you guys got a ribbon for—
<b>DR:</b>	Was that good when they were able to help you out?  Did you like that so you didn't have to like worry so much?  Is that a yes or a no?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's a yes.  One of the slowest yeses I've ever seen in my life.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.  So how did you plan this stuff with the class?  You just came up with this?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, I mean, but then how have things been since then?
<b>CG:</b>	Um, well, you know, we had the thing on Tuesday, yeah, Thursday he had stayed home from school.  I couldn't, he needed a mental health day at home.  So we gave him a mental health day.  Dad ended up taking off the day and we went a walk in the woods and we had some lunch together and I think that was all good by the evening back to the same mood.  Friday very, very difficult, but was one of those you've got to go days.  Um, and his inspiration to go was because that was the day they were performing their play.  Tuesday this week, or no Monday this week, um, very difficult day.
<b>PT:</b>	Mom, it wasn't on Friday.
<b>CG:</b>	It was Thursday, you're right.  Tuesday was the play.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, Tuesday.
<b>CG:</b>	That's right.  So Thursday was your I need a day day.
<b>PT:</b>	No, that was Monday.
<b>CG:</b>	No, Monday was, well, Monday became that because Monday I tried to be proactive, I called the school and said it's a difficult morning, could [NAME OTHER], his [INAUDIBLE] teacher meet us out front.  I'm going to need some help getting him inside.  I thought it would be easier to do the transition outside of school worse than inside of it.  And, um, she came, um, I had the girls with me so I took them inside, well, [NAME OTHER] was going to come and talk to him, well, I came back to the car and two of them were, cause I have a big SUVand two of them were in the trunk.  He apparently had crawled through the car to the back to get away from [INAUDIBLE].  She climbed back after him.  Um, and sat in the trunk of the car trying to get him to talk while his face is buried into the wheel of the tire, spare tire.  And became a running match between the front and the back of the car and, it's a Ford Excursion, they don't make them anymore because they're such unfriendly to the environment cars, but with seven of us we need it, and a dog.  And, um, so finally I was in the front passenger seat, she jumped into the back row after I let her out of the trunk and he was ready to go running back again.  She just kind of did a running slide into the back seat to stop and block.  And he sat in the driver's seat and finally I tried to convince him to get out.  And she proceeded to pull away and get out of his jacket and started to run around the car in the parking lot with car backing up so we yelled at him to stop.  And, um, took his hand and I got a lot of kicking and stomping on my feet and things.  So we got him inside.  Since the principal got involved and gave him an option of, you know, classroom's too noisy, wear headphones.  If you don't want to take the AR test right now, you don't have to.  Try it after the break if you want to see have, you know, spring break to relax and then you can try it.  She had options but then, um, gave him the option of, you know, what do you want to do, do you think you need to go home today or do you want to stay?  Well, of course, it was go home.  And so it made it very difficult.
<b>DR:</b>	Impossible.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, and as I was leaving was talks too about possible homebound instruction.  And this was the first time getting involved in any scenario.  So that's when I called you guys [INAUDIBLE] about what's going on.
<b>DR:</b>	We're not, we can't record what you're thinking as you left, right?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Well, and, you know, even [NAME OTHER] was saying like, I'm sorry, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	She even knew.
<b>CG:</b>	She knows.  And you can see it.  [INAUDIBLE] but yesterday he didn't go in because his, uh, it's been a long weekend too, I'm not remembering any words right now.  His throat was a little sore.  He has his asthma and allergies and my allergies are kicking in with the nice weather and then freezes and all of that.  And postnasal drip down his throat really raspy and sore.
<b>DR:</b>	When, did he go Tuesday?
<b>CG:</b>	Um, Tuesday he went with some prodding, and, um, Wednesday he did not go because [INAUDIBLE] feeling good and I was like [INAUDIBLE].  He couldn't talk, he was sleeping 'til eleven o'clock, so I was like all right, well, [INAUDIBLE].  Today was a football hold to the car, him screaming, and by the arm to get in the door.  I was told you could see it on his face this morning [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	See what?
<b>CG:</b>	The feelings of, you know, unhappiness on her face this morning.  But that's where we're at.
<b>DR:</b>	So I still don't understand your first statement about sabotage.  But you can tell me later.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, no, because he was being so good.  Everything was going great.  And then all of a sudden, I guess it was like the AR tests.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, it's not like you sabotaged it.
<b>CG:</b>	No, well, I mean, by saying that he was, figure of speech.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, you jinxed it or something.
<b>CG:</b>	I jinxed it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay, okay.  I got it.  I got it.  All right.
<b>CG:</b>	Saying something about it being so good.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  So, oh, that's why you're here today.
<b>CG:</b>	Normally we wouldn't been coming until Wednesday.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  So do we, um, do you still have that appointment or you canceled it?
<b>CG:</b>	As far as I know, we still have it.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  It might be as simple as, had this not, you know, Mars and Venus and every planet come together at the same time maybe it wouldn't happen, you know.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about, but a lot of, you know, when a lot of things happen at the same time, sometimes it makes it very hard to do some things.  So they always talk about planets coming together or something.  But I'm talking about all these big things, plays and tests and other things.  And that seem to make you worried more.  But, um, so, um.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] because I think they looked at me like I had two heads before because they never saw anything like it at school.  But I'm like [INAUDIBLE] before and it was sort of still.
<b>DR:</b>	But that's like that option they mentioned is something they are very reluctant to do.  I mean, I don't know, this is like the first time, it's usually a fight to get that.  So not that that's not a good thing.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, since [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right, and it's not, it's only temporarily with the turn plan, so it's not, it's sort of regressing.  I mean, it's not the right thing to do.
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  So all right.  Let's do, let's make sure we still have it.  Um, I'll go check.  Well—
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Wait, what is this?
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b>	Change in behavioral [INAUDIBLE].  Even though I tried, you know, okay at bedtime [INAUDIBLE] wasn't really [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, so basically suicide thoughts, talk about, more anxiety, but not necessarily depression, it's more mostly anxiety.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Agitated and restless.  Only related to the anxiety.  Right?  I mean, to the fears.
<b>CG:</b>	Well.
<b>DR:</b>	More than that.
<b>CG:</b>	It would be expressed for anything that occurred.  Due to the stress level.  You know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean, maybe he was about to get what he wanted, but, you know, you said the wrong word first, focus on that one word, wasn't listening to the rest, it's like wait a minute, did you hear what I said.  You can have this, you know.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Change in sleep?
<b>CG:</b>	He hasn't been sleeping very well.  He's been wanting somebody to be with him all the time lately.  He's got a very nice big brother and big sister.
<b>DR:</b>	Panic attacks.  [INAUDIBLE] new or worse irritability.  Related.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, aggressive, angry, violent?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I'd have to say he was.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, only when resisting right?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Acting on dangerous impulses.
<b>CG:</b>	The parking lot thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, extreme increase in activity or talking or other unusual changes in mood or behavior?
<b>CG:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	I can see he's very active.  No, I mean, besides during these episodes.  Not particularly.
<b>CG:</b>	Truthfully, it's one of those deals of meltdown and then run and hide, come out like nothing happened, then something sets that off.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not an all the time activated and, sometimes it's like nothing's happened for a while 'til someone opens their mouth.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Or something, okay.  All right.  Well, we'll just keep watching these, keep an eye on these.  Tell me if you see any.  Don't stop the meds.  Increase the, we'll do the 3 mg.  Um, all right, so go talk with [NAME OTHER].  Ay, ay, ay, okay.  All right.
