BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: It is the end of the day. But your schedule said it was [inaudible 00:09]
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah .
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Sighs] <i>Haaaa</i>.
THERAPIST: Um, still looking out for 5:15 time. We should know in the next week or two.
CLIENT: OK. [Shifts in seat] [Now that I'm back to five days it] (ph) would also be good...
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: ...Because, um, I felt that it is really hard to motivate myself to go to the gym after I've spent an hour in the car, driving, because being in the car makes me very sleepy, and I just want to go home and nap. It has been much easier for me to go to the gym after one of these appointments because it is five minutes from the [inaudible at 00:43].
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: And it is better to go the gym more spread out?
CLIENT: Yeah...
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: ...Or at least back-to-back days are a little — a little rough. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, OK.
CLIENT: Which, uh — I realize this isn't really your — your primary concern here in treating me, but I get the vision (ph) that it isn't a benefit of coming here after work. [00:01:05]
THERAPIST: Sure, yeah, I can make it easier to help. [I can, too] (ph).
CLIENT: So...
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...I like my job, and I'm finding that when I can put aside the anxiety and actually, like, sink my teeth into the project we're in (ph)...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: ...I'm doing fairly well. But the problem is I keep...
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: I keep ending up going and screwing around on social media websites, and it is really, really embarrassing when one of my coworkers comes into my cube to talk to me, and I'm always on Facebook or Twitter. Like, it is making me look bad [chuckles] and it is embarrassing, and...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: ... [Sighs] [Shifts in seat] I don't know. The — you shouldn't do those because you should be focusing on your work, [damn it] (ph). Mental refrain (ph) isn't really helping. [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: So that one's (ph) not doing the trick?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: Well, I don't know how to [pauses] — how do I convince myself to just stay off? Like, it seems like it should be so easy, like just don't open the website. Right? But I don't — I'm really angry at myself, that I'm having this much trouble with it.
[Silence for 14 seconds]
THERAPIST: Well, [pauses] — uh, I guess that that means that it is not clear what you're up against. In other words, [pauses for 15 seconds] — like, [chuckles] sorry in advance for this ridiculous metaphor, but, um, you know, if you're trying to push a door closed... [00:03:18]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: Like, "Damn it! This is a door. Why isn't it moving? You know, why can't I push this closed?" And then you look and it turns out there's a piano behind it, [chuckles] and that's why it won't [chuckles] close.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, it puts things in a [chuckles] different perspective. There must be some piano.
CLIENT: Right. So how do I move the piano?
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Well, that's where the [chuckles] metaphor breaks down 'cause maybe not. Like, "Oh! There's a piano there." OK, I can figure out what to do to move a piano now that I know it is a piano. If it turned out that, actually, one of the hinges in the door wasn't working, I would do something different.
CLIENT: Right. [00:03:59]
THERAPIST: Or if, you know, if the door frame were crooked, so it was preventing the door from closing, I would do something different.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But now that I know it is a <i>piano</i>...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I can figure out what to do about that, so that would be the next step. That's for example.
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for nine seconds] — and this is usually an out-of-the-frying pan-and-into-the-fire sort of thing in psychotherapy — like, if I had to guess off the top of my head, I would imagine that it is very — it can be very reassuring and soothing for you to make contact, like...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...With the social world or other things online. And I think you can be so anxious at work...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Because you're afraid of the beating you're going to give yourself a lot of the time. You know? [00:05:07]
CLIENT: That's — that's certainly part of it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: I think another part of it is...
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...I really worry about missing out.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: Like, if I'm not online and watching the feed, there might be something important going on, and I won't know, or I might miss an invitation. Right? And, you know, [pauses] on one hand, there's a little bit of truth to that. Like, sometimes people do organize spontaneous "let's go get drinks after work," or, "let's go to this show after work" or whatever, and if I'm not online, I miss that. But [pauses] on the other hand, what if — [chuckles] what are the costs and what are the benefits of missing out on that? Right? Like, [pauses] — but I guess I still [pauses] — with regard to social anything, I feel like I'm still in famine mode. Um... [00:06:05]
THERAPIST: Sorry. In what?
CLIENT: Famine mode.
THERAPIST: Oh, "famine."
CLIENT: Where — despite all of the mountains of evidence to the contrary, uh, there's — I still believe that I don't have very many friends, and I absolutely must take advantage of <i>any</i> invitations offered to me regardless of whether they sound interesting or not, because it might be my only chance to go out and see people and — like, there really are - when I'm being more rational — mountains of evidence against that perspective, but there's [pauses for five seconds] — but I'm reminded of my grandparents, who were very affected by, um, [global II] (ph) rationing and etcetera, etcetera, and they kept hoarding stuff their entire lives even though they were — I would assume they died solidly middle class. They still would save and reuse plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and paper towels because they were — that mindset was so engrained. [00:07:12]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I feel like I'm that way with regards to human contact. Like, I'm always the last person to leave a party because I can't bear to miss out. Like, if I leave an hour early and go home, and get sleep, which I usually need, [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...I might miss something cool happening or something would — I don't know. So I think that's a big part of it, also.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. It sounds like a piano.
CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah. And what you said about it being really soothing to hook into that social network, and there's that — that dopamine hit when you say something witty, and then like 30 people retweet it, and it is all over the Internet. [00:08:00]
THERAPIST: [Faintly chuckles]
CLIENT: Like, "Dude, people think I'm cool!"
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: But it doesn't matter that I don't understand this alias victim target buffer thing because...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah, "alias victim target buffer" is actually the name of the thing I've been working on for the last few days.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It is a great name.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] It is great.
CLIENT: Like, there has got to be like an [S.F. Moore] (ph) story around an alias victim buffer...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Uh, [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um, but yeah, so even if I don't understand that alias victim buffer — like, people on the Internet think I'm cool. Right?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: This author whose work I really like just retweeted this thing I said. That's kind of awesome.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And so [pauses] — but...
THERAPIST: That seems related to the first thing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I feel like it really is damaging my reputation that whenever people come into my cube, they'd see Facebook or Twitter open, and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...It is really frustrating for me, but it is interpreting the — when I get frustrated, the first thing I do is interrupt what I'm doing and go screw around on the Internet instead of pushing through the frustration. Like, I feel very judgmental of myself for that, that, you know — that something small children do when they get frustrated — they give up and quit — like it is a sign of maturity to be able to push through frustration. [00:09:16]
THERAPIST: [Right, I see] (ph).
[Silence for 21 seconds]
THERAPIST: I don't think [pauses for 16 seconds] — um [pauses] — I sort of, like, don't think these two parts of yourself converse very often. There's the... [00:10:06]
CLIENT: Which two parts?
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'm going to try to...
CLIENT: OK, sorry. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] No, it is OK.
CLIENT: Jumped the gun there.
THERAPIST: Like, [pauses for seven seconds]...
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]
THERAPIST: You're pretty clear about, you know, not wanting to kind of leave the social media party — you know? — and kind of [it'd be better, like] (ph) walk out the door and be on your own, and maybe miss something or miss something in the future, or lose a chance to get, like a — like a social kick. Um, [pauses] and then the other part where you're, you know, really judgmental about yourself and your work, and you've got all that toil and frustration — it is like, um, you're acting like a little kid who can't tolerate being frustrated and... [00:11:09]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And it is embarrassing or even humiliating when people come repeatedly and see you on these social media sites, and...
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: ...Like rant, rant, rant, rant, rant, I think.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that part and the [pauses] part that, you know, uh, [pauses for nine seconds] sort of [pauses] really wants to be part of the social scene and can feel very left out...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...And kind of lacking confidence, I think, when you're not — like, it is not like — those things aren't talking. You know? [00:12:02]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I don't know quite why I'm putting it that way, but that's sort of how it sounds. You know?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: There's not a kind of balance, "Well, yes, and I do this."
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, sure.
THERAPIST: "It sometimes get in the way, but [pauses] they're just kind of separate."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It makes me think of, like, your father ranting at you and there being absolutely no room or opportunity for <i>any</i> other point of view whatsoever.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: You know, no reasoning with what he said, probably often not even — after you, like, really confront or disagree...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Like no space for anything else. [Pauses for five seconds] That's what it makes me think of. [00:13:00]
[Silence for seven seconds]
CLIENT: So how do I fix it?
THERAPIST: [Coughs/clears throat]
[Silence for 30 seconds]
THERAPIST: Well, what's your concern? Um, [pauses] is your concern that sort of talking about it, understanding how it works, [pauses] getting a feel for what it has been like won't help to fix it?
[00:14:00]
CLIENT: Well, I don't know — it might or might not, but [pauses] I want it fixed [chuckles] by whatever path is necessary. I mean, I guess — I guess there are multiple things that need to be fixed for it. Like, there's the fact that my internal monologue's very much like my father's voice, and allows absolutely no room for disagreement. Um, and there's the fact that I'm...
THERAPIST: Or even [pauses] reality.
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Oh, oh [chuckles] I mean, in other words, such as, "I also like talking to people," like that's part of reality in this case.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, right, so there's that. There's the fact that I <i>can't</i> push through frustration, and that's something that I think I need to address. [00:14:59]
And then there's the being <i>so</i> socially insecure and scared that I can't break off from social contact even when there really are legitimate pressing reasons not to. Like, work is an example, or another example is being at the party until four in the morning when I know I have to be up the next day, but I could have left at one, or any number of —
Like, [shifts in seat] there are three different things going on that I feel like need to be fixed to be a little simplistic in my terminology. I don't know how to go about fixing them.
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses for five seconds] well, [pauses for seven seconds] I think what maybe — it is like I heard two things going on here.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?[00:16:00]
THERAPIST: Uh, [pauses] the psychological part...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Is I think you're saying, "No, Brian, because this is fucking intolerable, I don't feel like I can live with this, really..."<br />
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ..."The humiliation at work, the —" [pauses]—what is the feeling more accurately? - um, the feeling of social desperation, I think, and then —or the way it makes your life hard.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I think you're saying [pauses] something about how hard those things are to bear.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:17:00]
THERAPIST: Uh, [pauses] and responding to that by [pauses for five seconds] saying you've got to do something...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Like, "Ouch! How do I pull my hand away from the stove?" You know?
CLIENT: [Sound of rubbing two things together]
THERAPIST: [Faintly chuckles] Um, [pauses] and then I think — so I guess part of what I'm trying to suggest there is that [pauses for nine seconds] the way — the way this kind of thing works, like the way therapy works...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Is, [pauses] uh, [pauses for nine seconds] sort of like recursive pianos? [Chuckles] [00:18:05]
CLIENT: [Sound of rubbing two things together again] [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] You know, um — [pauses] so [pauses] like, ten minutes ago, it wasn't clear why it was hard to get off the social media sites; now, at least we have some pretty good indications about that.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But it is not clear what to do about that.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, and [pauses] I think if we looked at it some more, we'd learn [pauses] why you feel so crummy about yourself, socially. You know?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And so [pauses] desperate to do — take any sign of social opportunity that you can.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:18:58]
THERAPIST: Um, I think dealing with the pain that goes along with that and sort of putting into perspective what's happened — and you know a lot of it, but there's probably stuff you don't know — um, would probably make it easier.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Like, again, it is a case of having to do something, but the pain is so hard to bear.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: In other words, it is so hard to feel left out...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...That you've got to stay on a website.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So the intensity of the pain, the difficult of bearing it swings you into action.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And an action that's kind of compulsive in that you can't control it very well.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So, you know, you find a way to, like, bear and put into perspective the pain, and that helps to free you up in terms of what you do about it...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:19:56]
THERAPIST: ...Or what you do in response to it. You know? Like, [pauses for 15 seconds] in a way, you could say that the pain that leads you to look on those [you know, sort of standing outside and have hard time getting off of them] (ph)...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Is a communication from lots of kind of social injuries and loneliness...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...From the past. And, you know, my impression is you've thought a fair amount about that stuff and have born some of that.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But, um, it is still really pretty hard to bear, which...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And the thing that makes it easier is usually sitting with it or talking about it, looking at it. [00:21:02]
Do you have a perspective on things like that (ph)? Um, [pauses] so I guess [clears throat] [fidgets] [pauses ten seconds] that is kind of my answer to what you do about it...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Is, well, first of all, let's look at the intensity of the need to do something about it, 'cause that's why it points back to the pain that you're in over it...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And dealing with that is actually what you do, and dealing with that means sitting with it, looking at the ways it crops up in your life, and putting perspective on it like that, which is all sort of a step of [pauses] therapy (ph).
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 21:55] Is that — am I answering you or addressing your question? [00:22:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] It is also, I guess, why I'm [pauses] — I try to be careful answering questions like that because....
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...The wish for a kind of a — the way you put it, it is if others (ph) are kind of an instrumental solution...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Which itself — which is the problem [pauses] in a way. Like, the instrumental solution for dealing with the sort of pain and sense of desperation around social stuff is to spend time on social media websites.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: You know, like the instrumental solutions are the — we call them symptoms.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: You know? [Pauses for 15 seconds] That's not a very organized answer, but [chuckles] does that answer your question? [00:23:00]
CLIENT: So you're saying that the thing that I view as the problem by spending a bunch of time on Twitter is not actually the problem; it is a symptom of some other problem? Like, I just want to make sure I understood what you...
THERAPIST: Right — said. Um, [pauses]...
CLIENT: Or is maybe a — a maladaptive solution to some other problem?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and that other problem is [pauses] how hurt you are...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...About social stuff. [Pauses for ten seconds] Yeah. [Pauses for five seconds] [00:24:00]
Um, [shifts in seat] [pauses for nine seconds] it is a way of both coping with and avoiding [slaps surface] the pain.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
[Silence for 12 seconds]
THERAPIST: Yeah, coping with, avoiding, and keeping yourself somewhat in the dark about the reasons for the pain. [Pauses for eight seconds] I mean, that's like what all of us do.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I'm not trying to single you out there.
[00:25:00]
[Silence for eight seconds]
CLIENT: So how do I get over it so I can, you know, be functional at work?
THERAPIST: Keep talking. I mean, I know that's...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [pauses] That's hard.
THERAPIST: ...Not the answer — well, how come?
CLIENT: [Sighs] [pauses] I don't know. There's just this — [pauses] yeah, on any given topic, but I mean especially on the interactions with my peers and social stuff, there's just so much history there. It is kind of hard to make sense of it. I almost feel like [pauses] [sighs] talking about it just leads to kind of the facile, "Well, of course you were a loner as a kid because all geeks are loners," and, "Suck it up and deal with it." [00:26:00]
[Pauses for eight seconds] And I also really, really don't like reliving some of my memories of being bullied and ostracized as a kid, and I guess I kind of don't have much faith that — that wallowing in that is helpful.
[Silence for 34 seconds]
[00:27:00]
THERAPIST: [Shifts in seat] [pauses for 14 seconds] well, [pauses for 30 seconds] [clears throat] [shifts in seat] um, [pauses for seven seconds] the two things that you're referring to...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...You know, a bunch of [pauses] — on one side — on one hand, a bunch of [pauses], in a way, separate, more and less awful pieces of your history... [00:28:17]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...That sort of — [shifts through but not really draw] (ph) conclusions of that...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And [pauses], I mean, kind of wallowing in diffuse, sort of very painful feeling about everything that's happened - um, [pauses for seven seconds] are sort of a bit different from what I'm referring to. Like, what tends to happen with people over time — though when I imagine these — I don't really know, but I imagine you saw this in your [insomnia group in therapy] (ph), is that out of those things emerge stories about what happened, that organize the events and the feelings so that, [pauses] again, over time, it is less like [pauses] lots of some more isolated, painful events and this sea of awful feelings about them... [chuckles]
CLIENT: [Faintly chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...And more like, [pauses for six seconds] [door opens and closes in distance] you know, story and, "No," something like that, where it has a shape and an arc, and [pauses] there's character development, I mean, to sort of curve it a little. Like, that's what tends to emerge over time. [00:30:12][00:30:17]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: I don't know if that fits with your experience of therapy before. Um, [pauses] but that's also why, [pauses] uh, I and those like me sort of encouraging free association as opposed to, "Well, we know what sucked. Let's go back and talk about it, and just continue to talk about it and talk about it." You know, that's a much more directive, structured thing.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And the reason [pauses] that doesn't work...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Is because [pauses for nine seconds] you don't really learn as much you didn't know before...[00:31:10]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...About sort of the connections of things and the way that you unconsciously make "me, not them" or the deeper aspects of what you feel are that are kind hard to wrap your head around...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...As you get by kind of free-associating. Like, that's sort of — though it seems it is in a way thought is directed the way to get to a more directive story more quickly, generally, as compared to [pauses] [I don't speak, kind of go right in here and go back and look at these three [painting things] (ph). But in hard times, things like trauma and stuff where it is important to really finish and focus on a few particular things, just to sort of start talking about them is a little different from what we're talking about. [00:32:00]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I'm not saying you will never [trace trauma] (ph), but I think — I think that that's sort of a different thing. [Pauses for seven seconds] Does that answer your question?
CLIENT: [Clucks] A little bit.
THERAPIST: Pretty big.
CLIENT: But I guess [sighs] [slaps surface] [pauses] um, part of why I stopped seeing Chrissie [slaps surface] as my therapist....
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...Was because it just turned into a weekly, you know, "How much work did you get done?" and, "In what ways did you goof off from your work?" "You know that you're goofing off hurts your advisor as well as you." "You're not just hurting yourself." Her whole theory was that I was goofing off at work, um, out of a — a subconscious desire to sabotage myself because I was mad at my parents for forcing me to become an [inaudible]. [00:33:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And, I mean, it is a theory, and it is not entirely wrong. Um, well, in fact, I think it might be largely right, but, um, it was week after week after week after week of, "You know, if you look at this through a feminist lens, your advisor is a woman of color, and in the Academy, that's hard for a woman, and you should — maybe if you build a sense of solidarity with her, that will overcome your need to self-sabotage," and it just got very [breathlessly] [chuckles in exasperation] very tiresome very quickly. It just...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...Um, clearly, since the solidarity about being women in academia did not overcome whatever else it was that was going on in my head, that was making it hard for me to work and...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Self-sabotage certainly might have been a part of that, but....
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Um, [pauses for five seconds] so yeah, that's one example. But, overall, I think Chrissie's strategy was set up competing structures and, in my brain, that could kind of overwhelm with the — the ones that I saw as problematic and that... [00:34:13]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: [Sighs] It didn't work. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It helped some — things are better...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: ...But it...
THERAPIST: That's good.
CLIENT: But I'm still having issues. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean, in — that's not so much how I do things. I mean, people work from different models. It is...
CLIENT: Yes. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] [slaps surface] Um, [pauses] and there's another thing that I should probably — that I should mention about how I do do things, which you — in terms of — I also notice in some ways — um, [pauses] whatever the issues are that someone brings to this sort of therapy... [00:35:03]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...Like, they inevitably in various ways get played out in the relationship.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: Like, the big relationship, and — I mean, especially over time, it is <i>usually</i> very important to [pauses] look at them...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ....As they're coming up in the relationship. Like, uh, [pauses] that's really how a lot of the most important stuff emerges over time, is not just in, like, the content of what you say or the way that we can sort of identify patterns and see pianos (ph), you know...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...But in [pauses] — like, uh, [pauses] — they [aren't gets what happens between us] (ph) — um, I don't know if that was what Chrissie talked about, but I would imagine that [pauses for seven seconds] how much you — I know you thought about it a lot, actually, because you told me. [00:36:24]
There are — I'm sure there [are waves] (ph) that was going on between you recapitulated some of the things you were talking about. I don't know if that was the sort of the thing you guys talked much about or not, but I think that's — in my view — I'm not trying to be critical of the [part of you, generally] (ph), but, in my view, that's important stuff to talk about.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Like, from where I'm coming from.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [00:36:50]
THERAPIST: Um, and that's actually, [pauses] uh, an alarm (ph) might the sort of work where it seems to me that a lot of the change comes from sorting things out as they emerge in the relationship.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: But that — you know, that takes a little [slaps surface] time to develop and, um — yeah.
CLIENT: [Faintly] Yeah. [Pauses for ten seconds] Yeah. [Sound of rubbing something]
THERAPIST: Is this — are your questions coming out of [pauses] worry or uncertainty about where this is going, or — or frustration with [pauses] how it is not [chuckles] helping?
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Well, I think [pauses] [inhales] [pauses] a lot of it is just [sighs] [pauses] — you're so much more — less <i>blehh</i> [what am I even saying?] (ph) - less as directive than the last two therapists I saw... [00:38:13]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...That it is — I don't know — I still don't know what to make of it because this is a completely different model from what I'm used to, and...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Again, I — I don't understand how this model is helpful. And I'm willing to take your word that it is because, I mean, you're the one who's studied the human brain for however many years in grad school and... [slaps surface]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...I didn't, so [chuckles] I....
THERAPIST: Sure, sure.
CLIENT: ...I trust that you know what you're doing.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But, like, not understanding it myself is a little bit unsettling to me? I like understanding things, and I don't like not understanding things. Um, and it — it is a little bit hard for me to — to give up control when I don't fully understand what's going on. [00:38:57]
THERAPIST: Sure, sure. Um, [pauses for 15 seconds] are there other sort of things or aspects of this that you're feeling particularly unsure about?
CLIENT: You haven't given me any homework to do, which I find a little bit unusual in my, you know, grand experience of having seen three providers [shifts in seat]...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...In the last five years, so [chuckles] — kind of [a sample set] (ph)...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Sure. Um, [pauses]...
CLIENT: I mean, not that I was good at actually doing my homework when compliance rates were remarkable poor in [chuckles] that regard.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It just became one more thing for me dig in my heels and be like, "Nuh-uh, don't want to. Can't make me," but... [00:40:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: [Quietly chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] Um, not that these sort of things play out between therapists and — I mean, you know...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Uh, [pauses] [sighs] yeah, I generally don't give homework, um, because, [pauses] again, in this approach...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...One among others, uh, [pauses for 28 seconds]...
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat]
[00:41:00]
THERAPIST: ...That would kind of feel a little, to me, like sort of creating a symptom or directing our attention away...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...From the trouble? I mean, [pauses] you know, it is always kind of interesting what people do or don't, like, think about or take with them from therapy. In other words...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...You know, [pauses] whether the next time you get on Facebook at work, you think, "Hmm, do I feel sad?" You know, like...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Or not, or you completely forget about what we've talked about. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles] I mean, that sometimes goes [a long ways to make them feel better] (ph).
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: But, uh, you know, this is not like — I don't imagine it — I mean, there <i>should</i> be — I mean, you know, there isn't or there is some, like, reciprocity. You know? Like, "Well, you know, we talked about this, and so I tried that, and..." [00:42:04]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ..."This worked and that didn't, but I learned this," and, "Oh, that helps us understand this," "Oh, so now I —" — you know, there is that kind of back and forth.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But, [pauses] um, I don't think it is really facilitated by my saying, "Well, you know, next time this happens, think about this," or "try to do that."
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Um, the other thing which is relevant here, I think, is [pauses] [sighs] [pauses] uh, [pauses for five seconds] the lack of information about what I want from you...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Or what I think you should do is deliberate. Um, I suspect that part of what makes you [pauses for seven seconds] — I think there are a lot of reasons you like to know how things work. [00:43:09]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: You know, some get it like an engineer, and...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...You like thinking about things, figuring things out.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: You know, you take pleasure in that. Um, I — I think some of it, also especially when it comes to relationships, is to do with feeling so vulnerable and scared.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: I mean, maybe it is a little like not knowing if there is a party or...
CLIENT: [Shifts in seat] Right.
THERAPIST: ...Or a chance to get together, like not knowing quite where somebody is coming from or...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...What they're about, or how they're doing things. I mean, if you put yourself in somebody's hands, you're in some danger if you don't know that stuff.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And, um, [pauses] you know, so that's — that's a way you experience that aspect of this, that might be different from somebody else.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: It is not unusual, but it... [00:44:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...You know, it is also particular to you, and it evokes those feelings, which then become akin to...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Um, you know, about like kind of wanting to be in the know about what you're involved in and where someone — like, sure, anybody that put their hands in some of the — [about whom they kind of know little in the way that their therapist is going to stroke something that...] (ph)
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...To the point it stirs up and kind of plays out, is kind of part of this type of a therapy and presumably relates to the problem that the person is having in their life, which is the point.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: Is that...?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Sort of addressing it? You can stop for now.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Um, but we'll talk more tomorrow.
CLIENT: Good. [Shifts in seat] You know, there is something else I wanted to bring up, but, uh...
THERAPIST: Sure, do you want to mention it now and pick it up tomorrow, or do you want to just wait?
CLIENT: Entirely too good to mention in 30 seconds, so...
THERAPIST: OK, then we'll talk tomorrow.
CLIENT: ...Tomorrow, yeah.
THERAPIST: OK.
[Client walks away, opens door]
