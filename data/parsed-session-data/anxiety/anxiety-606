An old adage warns of the futility of locking the barn door after
the horse has escaped. Nevertheless, Chris now took the advice of
her friend Irmis Johnson, and employed an agent, Willis Wing,
to protect her literary rights. Ironically, she now had no such
rights left to protect.


The bloom was off the rose. From the beginning Mr. Wing, an
experienced literary sage, had concerns that Chris's effort to tell
her own story had already been eclipsed by the doctors' book, that
it would simply be reworking already plowed ground, and that a
market would be difficult to find for such a product. But she was
adamant, declaring that her story would be different, that she had
different material to be told and a different way of telling it. Her
intensity was convincing, and on the strength of it he wrote to
Corbett Thigpen asking two questions: Was there, indeed, additional
information to that which comprised the doctors' book?
What, if any, were their legal involvements with their now famous
patient?


The answer was discouraging on the first score and highly nonenlightening
on the second. Dr. Thigpen indicated that Chris's
treatment period and the pertinent past details of her life had
been thoroughly presented in their book, though interwoven into
psychiatric dissertations, psychological testings, and professional
personality observations. Their book, he said, was written mainly
for psychiatrists, other physicians, and those who are professionally
interested in psychology; however, he felt that it would
hold a genuine interest for the intelligent layman. He agreed that
Chris might have some stories which, if told from her own point

[p. <i>355</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00384&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Undaunted and seeking to fully represent the wishes of his client,
Willis Wing discussed these matters with McGraw-Hill,
which had published the doctors' book, and with which he had
worked on many projects over the years. They expressed keen interest
in a new book to the point of wanting to discuss contracts,
and declared that there was no question from their point of view
about Chris's quite absolute freedom to do her own story. James
Hull was in complete agreement, stating that after his evaluation
of the legal affairs of Drs. Thigpen and Cleckley, he saw no problems
that would stand in the way of her proceeding as she wished.
Again no mention was made of a contract existing between Chris
and her doctors.


Dr. Thigpen wrote to Chris informing her that he was mighty
interested to learn that she was again thinking of writing her
memoirs. He suggested that she use a ghostwriter and not attempt
to do the writing herself, advising Irmis Johnson for the job.
Unaccountably, Chris felt guilty, traitorous, as if her actions had
somehow been underhanded, ungrateful. She wrote to both Drs.
Cleckley and Thigpen once again, thanking them for all they had
done for her, expressing her eternal gratitude, and voicing a fear
that someday she might be a disappointment to them. Her inability
to criticize their book, yet her determination to set the record
straight by rewriting the story herself, had created within her overwhelming
feelings of guilt and anxiety.


<i>But they were wrong about so many things. All those events distorted
to hide her identity, that was wrong; the truth should be
told just exactly as it had happened, not distorted. And her</i>

[p. <i>356</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00385&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>But the biggest mistake of all was about her being well. She
was not well at all, nothing had changed except that the new
personality who came was an entirely different one from all the
others: No. 13! O God, is there no end? There were still voices,
headaches, suicide attempts; and even Dr. Thigpen did not
understand that. And he had always understood before. Why
did he keep telling her that she was well? He saw Jane, talked
with her in Dr. Barfield's office. Then he saw the Blind Lady
and talked with her. That's just the way it's always been. But</i>
now <i>he tells her that she's doing it herself, doing it</i> to <i>herself!
But she isn't, it's just like before. Does that mean she was doing
it before, too? Making herself ill? If so, why didn't he tell her
then? Now she has nobody to help her, nobody to turn to.
Other doctors won't believe her story of who she is, and Dr.
Thigpen tells her she's well! If only the telling of her story could
bring her help</i>....


Encouraged by McGraw-Hill's interest and Chris's apparent
legal freedom, Willis Wing, according to her instructions, located
for her a professional writer, James W. Poling, to weave the pattern
of her thoughts into a whole fabric. Mr. Poling, a veteran in
the art of story writing, after reading <i>The Three Faces of Eve,</i>
raised the obvious question of duplication of effort; but he, too,
was swayed by the publisher's interest, and agreed, after a visit
with Chris, to undertake the challenging task. He indicated that
he would need, in addition to the information supplied to him by
Chris herself, to interview Drs. Thigpen and Cleckley and to view
the data concerning her case to be found in their files. An early

[p. <i>357</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00386&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Little did Chris realize the odds she was up against when she
confidently set about to take charge of her great adventure. From
the outset, she declared that she was now going to reveal her identity
and to tell the events of her life, including her continued illness,
exactly the way it had occurred. James Poling went to
Augusta to visit the doctors and innocently revealed these facts to
them. The reaction was as instantaneous as it was violent: It was
not to be done. The exposing of her identity would subject not
only her, but her husband and family as well, to unpleasant personal
publicity and annoyance and would result in the definite
danger of the knowledge of her old illness, which was now behind
her, becoming a source of complexity and worry to Taffy. Dr.
Thigpen clearly stated these instructions to the writer and also
delineated them in a letter to Chris, suggesting that if anyone attempted
to identify her, she should warn him that he was laying
himself open to slander.


Poor Chris; she had never before considered her state to be so
disreputable that it would be slanderous to accuse someone of
having it. Was it true, then, that she was doomed to live out her
life in hiding, like a heinous criminal, a traitor to one's country, a
sex pervert? Her determination was completely crushed when
Messrs. Wing and Poling, after hearing the doctors' opinion,
agreed that it would be best to preserve her anonymity. Her capitulation
was a feeble attempt at face-saving.


"I said that I would be willing to reveal my identity <i>if it was
necessary,"</i> she fabricated. "I'm sorry everybody misunderstood."


She had lost the first and major round; the others were reduced
to minor skirmishes.


Dr. Thigpen had also vetoed any mention being made of her
continuing illness, referring to it as merely a "small rebellion" that
could be easily resolved. Jim Poling, unwilling to disobey the doctor
for fear of worsening Chris's condition, refused to consider
using the material until she had seen the doctor and discussed her
health with him. This resulted in an enormous conflict within
her: As the Blind Lady, she wanted to go, to tell of her present
troubles, to get blessed help; as Jane, the betrayed Jane, she refused
to go, feeling that the revelation of another personality

[p. <i>358</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00387&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The story was to be told as if Jane had actually died on that
night when she took the overdose of pills and laid herself out for
death. Chris had to return to her task of telling her "true" story,
while bearing on her conscience its falseness and bearing within
her being the ever-present, tormenting proof of its falseness. Jim
Poling agreed to this little deceit because he felt that it was best
for Chris and because he believed the doctor's prognosis that it
would not be too complicated to resolve the present trouble if no
fuss were made of it. So much for Round 2.


After Poling's visit to see Chris, he asked that she collect family
pictures for his viewing and that she write down a chronology of
the important events in her life. He also sent a long list of questions
to Dr. Thigpen, and it was then that another barrier loomed
across their path: The doctors stated that they would only allow
the book to be written if they could edit the material. Astounded,
in the face of the advice he had received concerning Chris's legal
entanglements, Mr. Wing pursued this and discovered that in the
contract she had signed with Twentieth Century-Fox there was a
clause that read:


Whereas, I hereby acknowledge and agree that by instrument
dated April 24, 1953 I duly granted to Corbett H.
Thigpen, M.D. and Hervey M. Cleckley, M.D. all worldwide
rights forever in my life story (Including without
limitation publication and other rights in all versions of
the Story written by or for them and those published as
aforesaid), and I have reserved unto myself no rights of
any kind whatsoever in my life story.


When the implications of this paragraph were explained to her,
Chris was deeply puzzled. She had no memory of signing such a
document, and she certainly had never been given a copy of one.
She had never lost a single scrap he had ever given her. If she had

[p. <i>359</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00388&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She got out her copy of the Twentieth Century-Fox contract.
There it was; it had always been there, so she must have seen it.
She simply had not understood its encompassiong implications, its
totality. She felt numb, shocked to discover that it was no longer
a question of whether she <i>would</i> write her story, but whether she
would be allowed to write it. At least the movie company had
paid to her a small fee for visualization rights, but she had received
nothing for the literary rights. Then her conscience struck
with a deadening blow: The doctors had treated her without fee!
Was this the price they had extracted for the treatment? If so,
why had they not told her? No matter, it was done, she accepted
it. If that was what they had wanted as payment, she would have
given it to them. So why fight the idea after the fact?


So went Round 3, and strangely no one asked to see this socalled
instrument, but accepted the simple allusion to it in the
other contract. Interestingly, no one commented on the identical
dating of the Fox contract and the Thigpen contract. The Fox
contract was dated April 24, 1956; the doctors' elusive instrument
was said to be dated April 24, 1953, exactly three years earlier.


Chris accepted all this, but the joy had gone out of her task.
Not only would her story be an "also-ran," but also she would
again get no recognition for it, and the very man whose story she
was attempting to correct would edit her material. Deep within
her a dull anger glowed, but it was so repressed that it would take
another fifteen years to surface; in the intervening years, it merely
scorched her soul, creating a gnawing anxiety that her futile
efforts to alleviate kept her life and the life of her family in constant
turmoil.


As a result of all these proceedings, Willis Wing negotiated a
contract between Chris and James Poling that contained a clause

[p. <i>360</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00389&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Chris finally realized how her plans had been thwarted
and curtailed, she fought back in the only way that seemed to be
left open to her: She withheld her additional information. If she
could not tell the world, she was not going to tell anyone. She did
not give Mr. Poling all the letters she had accumulated, and she
told him that she was unable to obtain any family pictures; she
gave him, in fact, very little that was not already in the doctors'
book. This was only his first disappointment, for when he visited
Augusta, he could not believe the paucity of information available
there. He reported to Chris that the doctors had lost a great deal
of the material on her case. Of all the many interviews, taped and
transcribed from shorthand, with Chris and her family, only five
typed reports and one tape survived. All the interviews dealing
with the details of her childhood had disappeared. The doctors'
only explanation to him was that the material must have inadvertently
been thrown out when they moved their offices.


Mr. Poling reassured her that none of this was fatal because she
could supply the missing data; it would just be more time-consuming.
Little did he know that she had no intention of supplying the
data missing from her case files, nor any additional data of which
only she was cognizant. He further assured her that Drs. Thigpen
and Cleckley could not have been nicer or more co-operative and
that he thoroughly enjoyed meeting them. One point, however,
was puzzling him: How were they going to treat the ending of the
story? With Dr. Thigpen insisting that she was well, how was the
fourth personality going to be explained? And there was still Jane
on the scene: What were they going to do with her? Mr. Poling
suggested that they had three alternatives: They could work toward
a different ending from the one they had planned; they
could have a story with no ending, leaving her state of health
unresolved; or they could assume, along with Dr. Thigpen, that

[p. <i>361</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00390&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jane was definitely very much on the scene, and her behavior
had grown more atrocious after she learned that the story was
being written anonymously and that her existence was going to be
publicly denied. She intensified her harassment of the already
frightened and cowered Blind Lady, forcing her into periodic
states of drowsiness, which permitted her to emerge. She had
lately, in desperation, changed her attitude toward Don and Taffy,
courting their favor and appealing her case to them. For nine-year-old
Taffy, she drew pictures of birds and springtime, and a
wedding dress she would like to be married in. She talked earnestly
to Don,


"I know you don't really care for me," she admitted, "but if you
will help me to stay alive, I'll leave, and you won't be bothered
with all this anymore."


"Don't talk like that, Chris," he ordered, slightly embarrassed.
"You're my wife."


"I'm not Chris, and I'm not your wife. I'm Jane," she corrected.
"And I know you don't like Taffy, either. If you help me, I'll take
her with me. Then you'll be free again."


"I do love Taffy!" he declared. "She's just like my own
daughter."


"Well, I don't see how you could love your wife! She's stupid!
Anybody can get an education this day and time. There's no need
for anybody to be as dumb as she is. She's fat and she never wears
any decent clothes." And there she sat, seemingly oblivious that
she was housed in the same body and draped in the same clothes
that she was so vehemently rejecting.


What could Don say? He merely looked at her, feeling himself
trapped in an eternal nightmare.


"You can't love a fat woman like that," she persisted. "Help me
and I'll take the body away, and you'll be rid of her for good."


"Aw, Chris, I'm just fed up with all of this, the whole thing!"
In disgust and frustration, he walked out.


When Jane disappeared and the Blind Lady "woke up," she immediately
looked for evidence that her counterpart had been present

[p. <i>362</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00391&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Chris, this is the silliest thing I've ever heard of!" he angrily
declared when she asked him what Jane had said.


And who could blame him? He had just sat there and watched
her finish the drawing. She had handed it to him saying,


"That's the dress I want to be married in." Then she had drowsily
closed her eyes and slumped down in her chair. Almost immediately
her eyes opened again and she asked,


"What's that in your hand?" Then, suspiciously, "Jane has
been here again, hasn't she? What did she say?" She took the picture
and gazed at it as if she had never seen it before.


What man would not withdraw in anger if his wife behaved in
this manner? If he steps over the threshold into a world where
myriad women inhabit the same body and vie for its possession,
might he not reach a point at which he would be unable to retrace
his steps out into the world of reality and sanity? Don retreated
from this dim, misty world while he could still see the
bright sunshine of his own world. From then on, he refused to be
drawn into the eerie conversations with the two parts of his wife's
whole. Whatever his inner thinking, he never again openly lent
any recognition to the long line of intruders awaiting their turn to
trespass into his life.


Again, the very element needed to sustain life for Janerecognitionwas
being denied her; and as she weakened, her struggle became
more vicious. She hated Jim Poling and the whole idea of
his doing her story, and she did all in her power to stop him, very
nearly succeeding. Jim spent a week at Chris's home in Cumberland,
Maryland, working with her, taping interviews, and gathering
personal information from Don and Taffy. One evening the
four of them went over to Frostburg College for dinner, and on

[p. <i>363</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00392&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Tell Jim Poling to mind his own business!"


Jim, sitting in the rear seat with Taffy, saw Chris give a start
and look around at him with a terrified, haunted look on her face.
Frantic, she grabbed the door handle and attempted to jump
from the car. Only the speed and momentum of rounding a sharp
curve prevented the door from swinging open. Jim yelled for Don
to stop the car, and, leaning forward, Jim grabbed Chris and held
her tight against the seat.


The car screeched to a halt and Don, stunned, asked,


"Chris, what happened? Did the door come open?" Was he giv-
ing her an excuse?


"It must have," she gasped, trembling. "I don't know what hap-
pened." But she did, and so did Jim.


Jim was worried. Not only had he grown to like this woman
personally, but he was also concerned that their work together,
pushing her to dredge up old, painful memories, might plunge her
once again into the depths of her illness, might even take her life.
When, a few days later, he found Jane's voice on a tape, he felt
compelled to speak to Chris about his fears. He had left the recorder
with Chris each night when he returned to his motel; and
one night Jane had recorded a message for him:


"If you don't leave here and mind your own business I'm going
to kill her and me. Then where will your old book be?"


The tone was hardly recognizable; it was vicious and sibilant,
hissing urgently in its near-monotone threat. Jim was shocked. To
this point he had believed this bizarre story only intellectually. He
replayed the section, then played excerpts from his tapings with
Chris. His astonishment grew. Even in anger, a voice is recognizable,
but it seemed hardly possible that this vitriolic tone could
have issued from the same vocal cords that produced Chris's low,
melodic southern drawl. The quality of the voice conjured up a facial
expression that, for the life of him, he could not stamp on her
gentle, smiling features.


He had no choice but to discuss it with her. Even though the
doctor had said she was well, this was not the behavior of a well
woman. Deeply embarrassed, she apologized humbly, promising
to try to prevent a recurrence of Jane's interference; but Jim

[p. <i>364</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00393&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the strength of this telephone conversation, Jim continued
with his work. It was slow, and he was often frustrated and discouraged.
A great deal of time was spent restructuring and disguising
events to make them unrecognizable. From time to time he
wrote to Chris requesting additional information and requiring
clarification on an issue; but largely her part of the task, except for
proofing, was over. She had now only the long wait while her
writer struggled to bring clarity and readability to the jumble of
facts before him.


She was regularly corresponding with Dr. Thigpen during this
period, and he continued to urge her to make a trip south, not
only to resolve her problem, but also to plan how to deal with Jim
Poling's material. Dr. Thigpen informed her that Jim had commented
that the two of them had different memories about certain
instances and that he, Dr. Thigpen, had a large number of
notes from which he was refreshing his memory. He acknowledged
her difficulty in attempting to recall events that had taken
place three or four years earlier, and felt that his notes and his
remembrances might serve to stimulate her memory. Also, he felt
that no doubt there would be some points that would require
clearing up between the two of them and between him and Mr.
Poling. Dr. Thigpen often pledged both his and Dr. Cleckley's
help and support throughout the entire writing, offering even to
continue handling some of her literary affairs, though she now
had an agent. It was the last week in June, however, before she returned
to Augusta, and then it was her acute physical health that
prompted a return visit to Dr. Barfield; she saw Dr. Thigpen only
briefly.


In late May, McGraw-Hill bought an option on the book for

[p. <i>365</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00394&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another point of lengthy contention arose over Chris's declaration
that there had been other personalities before Chris Costner
and Chris White and that they were separate and apart, distinct
from those with whom the doctors had worked. The doctors'
theory, as so stated in their book, was that those personalities were
simply earlier versions of Chris Costner and Chris White, citing
as proof that the two Chrises had memories of these earlier experiences.
A concrete example was Chris Costner's admitting to Dr.
Thigpen that she was the one who married Al Thome, leaving
Chris White to take all the punishment. Chris refuted this argument,
saying that the ensuing personalities always had some
knowledge of experiences preceding their birth and that even the
doctor acknowledged a suspicion that Chris Costner had been
lying about that episode. And how to explain this fourth personality:
the Blind Lady? The doctors valiantly attempted to do just
this in a final section ending Chris and Jim's book; but even so, it
was a ghost that refused to be laid, and Dr. Thigpen, when asked
about it over the years, began to declare that he had been misunderstood
about the resolution of the illness and that no amount of
explaining seemed to clarify the issue. As it happened, however,
he won the round, and Jim wrote the story as if the early personalities
were merely juvenile Chris Whites and Chris Costners instead
of different beings in their own right.


If Jim Poling's problems were severe while his book was in the
planning stages, they seemed pale compared with his difficulties

[p. <i>366</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00395&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jim indicated that he had every desire to be co-operative and
that he felt bad about their concern, but that he could not possibly
do as requested since Dr. Thigpen, especially, was a principal
character in the drama. Jim indicated to Chris that he had to be
free to handle the material, or his hands would be tied; and since
the doctors had already committed themselves to publicity and
profit, they should just adjust themselves to it. It was not that
easy! When Parts II and III reached Dr. Thigpen, he made two
agitated phone calls to Jim in one morning, expressing his distress
at the constant use of his name. While willingly admitting that
he and Dr. Cleckley had no leg to stand on, he beseeched Jim to
do something about the situation. He explained that as a psychiatrist,
his whole practice depended on referralsall of his patients
were referred to him by other doctorsand his practice could be
seriously damaged if the local American Medical Association Ethics
Board reprimanded him, of if local doctors decided that he was
a publicity seeker and refused to refer patients to him.


On the heels of this, Dr. Cleckley wrote to Jim for the first
time, also upset over the affair, and suggested that he do as the
movie company had doneuse aliases for the doctors as well as
for all the other characters. Jim sought the advice of both Willis
Wing and Bob Amusson from McGraw-Hill, and they finally concluded
that it would be wise to take Dr. Cleckley's suggestion to
avoid alienating the doctors and running the risk of a controversy
with them when the book was published. Chris, having no part in
the making of this important decision about her book, was merely

[p. <i>367</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00396&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But the problems were not over. Jim, fretting to Chris that Drs.
Thigpen and Cleckley had kept Parts II, III, and IV for over a
month, fervently prayed that they did not run into any basic
conflicts over the material. He declared that he was writing <i>her</i>
story, and hoped that the doctors were not going to insist on its
being written their way. He felt that such a situation would cause
Chris to have to make some decisions that would place a strain on
her loyalties.


Jim was further disturbed over the receipt of a carbon copy of a
letter Dr. Thigpen had sent to Chris in which he spoke of extracting
drops of blood from Jim by making alterations in his work.
Jim found the statement upsetting and resented the doctor's having
sent a carbon copy of such a letter to him. He almost recovered
his wry sense of humor, however, when, on calling to determine
the cause of the holdup on the manuscript, he was told that
<i>Mrs</i>. Cleckley had not finished reading the material. And when he
finally received the copy, there were extensive changes to be made,
mostly minor, however, with only one major rewrite job. As a result
of a paragraph in one of the doctors' manuscripts, in which
Dr. Thigpen had stated that an early letter from Chris had made
him suspect that he had a case of dual personality on his hands,
Jim had built a major section of Part II around this provisional diagnosis,
which had also been used in referrals for psychological
testing. The doctor insisted that he had never felt that his patient
had dual personality; Jim rewrote the section.


Jim relayed to Chris that Dr. Thigpen was also upset by her description
of his office manners, complaining that it made him
sound sloppy, and that he had never put his feet on his desk or
slouched in his chair in the presence of patients. Chris protested

[p. <i>368</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00397&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In November, she received the title that McGraw-Hill had chosen
for her book: <i>The Final Face of Eve</i>. Again her disappointment
was acute; she had carefully selected the title <i>Strangers
in My Body,</i> and that was the one written on the publisher's contract;
but now it had been changed. And the new title was just as
wrong as was the ending of the book. Not only that, it definitely
stamped the story as a sequel to the doctors' book. This news followed
on the heels of her receipt of the final part of the story,
written to show that Jane died that November night three years
ago when she took the overdose of pills and laid herself out to
await death. And it was not true, they all knew it was a lie; Jim
knew, Dr. Thigpen knew, she knew, and above all, Jane knew that
Jane still lived and fought desperately to continue living. The
harder they tried to eradicate her through ignoring her, writing of
her death, even pretending that she was only a minor disturbance,
the harder she struggled for life. The horror becomes inconceivable
when viewed from Jane's awareness: There was a conspiracy,
of which she was fully cognizant, to kill her; and though she
pled with everyone, even her "former" husband, for help, they all
turned deaf ears to her. The doctor who, she felt, once helped to
create her, who nurtured her, who aided her in the elimination of
her own competitors, now ignored her, described her as merely a
"poisonous apple that the stomach is attempting to disgorge."
And her body, the one she had fought for and had rightful claim
to, had been usurped by another who was stronger and more possessive
about inhabiting it. And the man who married her and
vowed to love and protect her for better or worse had now turned
his back on her and refused even to hear her plea for life. Finally,
they were going to announce to the world in <i>The Final Face of
Eve</i> that she was dead! There was no help in all of this world for
her. The suffocating nothingness of oblivion began to stifle her.


But Jane, the faade created to self-destruct, clung so tenaciously
to life and so tormented Chris that Chris began to fear for

"You are my friend, you know Jane exists. You've seen what she
is doing to me! Please, pray for me!" she begged.


Jim answered that he would be happy to pray for her, but that
she did not need his prayers. He advised her to see Dr. Thigpen.


"But I tried to tell him, and he didn't understand. I can't do
it," she wept.


Jim declared that he hadn't the slightest doubt about her ability
to do it, that she had the best kind of life with Don and Taffy.
Everything would work out, he promised her.


Don didn't understand, either; he no longer even wanted to talk
about it. Above all, he did not want her to return to Dr. Thigpen
for more therapy. But what choice did she have? She wrote to the
doctor and revealed her torment. He assured her that her present
trouble was just under the surface, and that perhaps merely a
scratch would let it burst forth, fruit, and wither, never again to
be trouble to her. Three appointments were set up for her between
Christmas and New Year's Day, and she kept the appointments.
They retraced events from her childhood in an attempt to
determine what troublesome, repressed material was causing this
apparent present need for her now familiar defense. She went
home each night to her mother and sought additional facts that
might throw some light into the dark corners of her past. The
doctor continuously probed into the little-known circumstances
surrounding that mysterious first marriage, about which none of
the personalities seemed to be aware. With Zueline's help they
pieced together enough facts to satisfy Dr. Thigpen that he knew
the full story and its implications upon the total picture. He had
been talking with both the Blind Lady and with Jane, who, though
hostile and resentful of his intentions toward her, always came out
on call.


On the last day of therapy, Dr. Thigpen called her out,


"Jane," he gently informed her, "you are going to have to go
away and let Chris live her life."


"That's what you think," she told him, her tone stubborn and
determined. "I'm not going to give up!"


"Yes, you are," he persisted, just as quietly determined. "You
will do what is best."

[p. <i>370</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00399&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I will not go away!" She defiantly threw up her head, hate
blazing in her eyes.


He moved to her, firmly clasping her shoulders with both
hands. "Good-bye, Jane." It was a statement, a dismissal, the ultimate
put-down. He chastely kissed her burning cheek.


The blazing blue eyes closed; she swayed; the color drained,
leaving the skin white and chill. Chris opened her slightly puzzled
eyes.


"She is gone, Chris," the doctor confidently told her.


"Is she, Dr. Thigpen? I hope so." The tone was also puzzled.


But Jane was not gone. In seeming deliberate defiance of the
doctor who had worked so hard to create her and was now striving
just as manfully to destroy her, she continued to manifest herself,
though weakly, for several days, as if to say,


"If I must go, I will do it when I choose, not when you demand
it."


Chris later wrote to Dr. Thigpen telling him that she was entirely
well. She never again, no matter how severe her problem became,
approached him for help or in any way alluded to her continuing
illness. He had pronounced her well; for him, she would
be well. The doctor responded, happy for her recovery and instructing
her to sit back and live the life of happiness she so richly
deserved, never forgetting that the most important thing in her
life was to make Don happy and to devote the rest of her life toward
that end.


In January, Jim finished the book. The last part had been most
difficult, since it had all occurred after her therapy, and there was
no case material from the doctors to inform him. For the ending
he had had to rely only on Chris's thoughts to guide him. A measure
of Chris's impact on the book can be assessed from Dr. Cleckley's
advice to Jim when Jim discussed these concerns with the
doctors; Dr. Cleckley advised him to project himself into the situation
and write events that "could have happened." Even periods
in her life of which only she had cognizance were not to be written
as she had experienced them, but as the professional writer
believed they could have occurred.


The writing was over; the waiting and the hoping began--and
all the news was bad. The magazines were just not interested:
<i>McCall's</i> was unhappy with the publisher's early release date;

[p. <i>371</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00400&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why she did it, she, afterward, never really knew. Perhaps she
felt that it was her last chance to tell the truth about her illness.
Or did she feel vindictive toward those who had "taken away" her
story, and deliberately set out to raise questions about their accounts?
Whatever the reason, she told Loudon Wainwright that
she was not well and that Jane still lived. Corbett Thigpen was
concerned. He wrote to Chris that Mr. Wainwright had informed
him of the new information she had given him and that it was
sure to sabotage her book. He stated that neither he nor Jim
Poling had included the material, because a book cannot be written
with a "lady or the tiger" conclusion, it had to have a resolved
ending; and that knowing that she could handle the Jane affair, he
had seen no need to make it public.


He warned her, under no circumstances, to talk with anyone
else, not even <i>Life</i> magazine, without discussing it with him first,
and that if a reporter did find her, she was to absolutely refuse to
talk and to feign ignorance. He also suggested that Don attempt
to find work in another section of the country and move away
from LaPorte, Texas, where she had been interviewed, so that not
even <i>Life</i> would be able to find her. He emphasized that he was
not especially upset with what she had done; he was only concerned
with her continued anonymity, which was necessary to her
continued good health.


When the <i>Life</i> article was published, it devoted half of its coverage
to the book and half to the new information that had been
omitted. Jim was gentle, calling it simply spilled milk and hoping
that the book reviewers would not pick up the discrepancies before
they wrote their reviews of the book. Dr. Thigpen urged her
to give her agent power of attorney to act for her, thus preventing
anyone's having access to her; that way she could just take whatever

[p. <i>372</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00401&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whether Chris's slip sabotaged the book, or whether it simply
collapsed under the weight of its many handicaps, <i>The Final Face
of Eve</i> was a failure as judged by public sales, never reaching ten
thousand copies. Foreign sales were even more pitifully small:
eighty copies sold in one country, one hundred in another.
Chris's one meager triumph came when her book was published
in England under her title <i>Strangers in My Body</i>. Jim was disappointed,
but he characteristically shrugged and admitted that they
had been aware of the gamble from the outset. Dr. Thigpen noted
that her article had, indeed, scooped her book.


When Chris received her first copy of her book, it was the first
time she had seen the edited material. After Dr. Thigpen had
made his corrections, he had sent the copy on to Jim, so Chris
had been aware of no corrections other than her own. This book
was as much of a disappointment to her as had been the first book
--it was, in fact, essentially the same book, bearing none of the
changes or corrections that had been the impetus behind its inception.
The deliberately altered events and the "could have happened"
events were so distorted that, if taken out of context, even
she would not have recognized them. And the ending was a lie.
She put it down after the first reading and did not pick it up again
for fifteen years. Neither did she view the movie in all those years.
Even though it played in movie houses all around her, and later
invaded her home on television, she made no effort to see it until
she watched it in 1975. If the story belonged to others, she would
have no part of it.


The literary critics did not rave, but for the most part they did
not entirely pan, either. The story, while called marvelous and remarkable,

[p. <i>373</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00402&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jim went on to other assignments. He and Chris remained
friends and correspondents over the years, and she asked him to
be the godfather of her son, a role that he declined, candidly admitting
that he was neither equipped nor inclined to fill such a
religion-fraught role.


Corbett Thigpen continued his practice of psychiatry in
Augusta. Public knowledge of his work now brought him invitations
to lecture around the country and to present papers before
learned groups. He and Chris continued to exchange letters several
times a year, but never again as doctor and patient; and she
occasionally visited him for a friendly chat when she happened to
be in the city. He became the godfather of her son, and each
Christmas he sent the boy greetings and a gift.


And Chris? She took the last advice Dr. Thigpen ever gave her
as her doctor: She gave Willis Wing power of attorney and
dropped out of sight as far as her true identity was concerned.
The big effort to reveal herself had failed; she admitted defeat and
tried no more. Oh, she was still interested, keeping every scrap of
information about her story: the movie ads, Joanne Woodward's
wedding announcement, Dr. Thigpen's lectures and his brief dabble
into politics, every sales slip sent her by Willis Wing, every
financial report made by the publisher. But what did she go on to?
To fifteen more years of insufferable anxiety, intolerable depression,
unbearable pain! Ten times she died, and ten times she rose
to live again. Unlike the glorious Phoenix, however, which arose
each time, shining and new from its ashes, her worn remains
