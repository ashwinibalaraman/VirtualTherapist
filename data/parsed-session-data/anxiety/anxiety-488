BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How have you been?
<b>PT:</b> Very well, much better than I had been.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm sleeping better and eating better and just getting around better.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good, good, so you had a good Thanksgiving?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I was over at my niece's house.  They picked me up and took me over there, so we had, uh, a good bit of turkey.  Everybody has turkey for Thanksgiving don't they?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, okay, so all positives this month huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Well, okay, so what do you think lead to the change, the improvement, what do you think it is?
<b>PT:</b> I don't really know, it just that uh, the medication I guess is helping.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we didn't make any big changes the last time.
<b>PT:</b> If I didn't take any medication then maybe it would harm me more so but this way, when I take my medicine and, uh, I was talking to my doctor and he says you didn't really want me on Ativan
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And yet Ativan seems to help me the best.  I take a, uh, 1 pill a day and it sort of relaxes me -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum
<b>PT:</b> And I don't, uh, I don't have much time to think about worrying. 
<b>DR:</b> I think when you had those falls and were having the problems with the balance and all -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That's when we needed to try to cut back on the Ativan a little bit more.  If you're doing better and you only use it occasionally, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But to take it on a regular basis, it's a medication you can get habituated to -
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>DR:</b> That if you take it every day, it can lose it's effectiveness.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And with your other medication that you take, it's always best, yknow, if there's a period where you feel worse or more anxious, to leave the Ativan as like a safety net, yknow -
<b>PT:</b> Oh
<b>DR:</b> You always want to keep it as effective as it could be for times in crisis.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So, yeah it's an okay medication but in terms of just taking it every day, that's where I was concerned for you.  Yknow, when you had those falls back in last, uh, winter and spring
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, you were also taking a little bit more Ativan at those times, like when you were in the hospital they put you on the Ativan and it just, it seemed to be a little bit too much, so -
<b>PT:</b> Well the doctor did ask me, yknow, if I was using it so much and I said well, uh, I just take it when I feel a little bit more nervous
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> Then I would take it
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's how it should be, just on occasion, yknow, when you feel more nervous but, yknow -
<b>PT:</b> But now it seems like I'm nervous every morning so I take it in the morning
<b>DR:</b> When you brought the discharge instructions from, uh, the hospital before, they actually had not discharged you on the Ativan either.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, when you were down at [DEIDENTIFIED] those 2 times, they, uh, had taken you off of the Ativan too, so that was my other concern was just making sure that, that if you were back on that, using it regularly, it wasn't one of the reasons why you were having the falls
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, no, I don't think so because I've been taking Ativan for quite a number of years 
<b>DR:</b> But they didn't give it to you in the hospital when you were at [DEIDENTIFIED] either time, well [DEIDENTIFIED], either in February or in July, they didn't include it on your medication list in the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, your discharge instructions didn't have Ativan on it either time.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So that was the concern but, yknow, even when you were in the hospital the last time, back in July, they cut your Zyprexa in half too which -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Wasn't necessarily the best idea either.  
<b>PT:</b> Hm.
<b>DR:</b> I mean the Doxepin and the Zyprexa, I mean my hope is, I mean they are medications to treat the anxiety and the voices and the whole shebang, my hope is that they stay effective for you, yknow, that they're your number 1 medications
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, well, I do take that, uh, Zyprexa and Doxepin at night before I go to sleep so that helps me to sleep better.
<b>DR:</b> But they aren't -
<b>PT:</b> That's one thing that makes me nervous, if I can't sleep then I just lay there twisting and tossing in bed and then I feel, I don't know, I just lay there and pray that I would fall asleep, because it's not right that you can't sleep at night
<b>DR:</b> But the Zyprexa and the Doxepin aren't sleeping pills only -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, they're designed to help with other aspects of the nerves too.  The Doxepin treats depression also and the Zyprexa helps with moods and helps with the, the voices.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> That's a medication that helps get rid of voices.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, and it has worked some.  I know it hasn't gotten rid of them completely for you.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Although has it been better, has that been better?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it's been better.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Since my last visit to you.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, so I'm hoping that eventually I'll be able to get off of it.
<b>DR:</b> Well, when you cut it back before, yknow, when you left the hospital
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> And were on the 2.5, remember your nerves had gotten worse and remember we increased it back up to the 5 mg -
<b>PT:</b> Milligrams, um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And I think, we talked about this I know before that the voices, I think are connected to where you had the surgery -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, that there's a scar there just like a scar here
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, like on the skin and that I think is kind of where the source of some of the voices came from, yknow, and just like the scar is there, the medication may need to be there ongoing.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you think so?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, only because the Zyprexa is one of the things that helps calm those voices.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And the voices are coming from a scar from your surgery.
<b>PT:</b> Well maybe, I thought maybe when I age a little bit more, maybe it will get better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, maybe.
<b>PT:</b> That maybe those voices won't be annoying me so much.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, maybe sometime like in the springtime we can look at cutting the Zyprexa back again -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, not because you're in the hospital like medically but just if things keep going well through this wintertime, that maybe in the spring when things are a little bit easier for you because I know winter is a little tough for you at home, yknow, that it's a little, little tougher in the winter than it is in the spring and the fall for you, um -
<b>PT:</b> Well, it don't seem to be too bad. I mean I got used to the wintertime, being alone for all these years, it's been, it's going to be 25 years since my husband passed away
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> And that's what was really driving me up the walls but uh, now I guess I'm getting used to it a little bit better -
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.
<b>PT:</b> I think maybe things will go along better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah that, hopefully, when they do go well this winter that we can then maybe cut back the Zyprexa to 2.5 again -
<b>PT:</b> Hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, touch wood that you won't be in a medical hospital, that it'll be a good winter.
<b>PT:</b> Let's hope not.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's what my prayers are everyday, that I don't end up in a hospital again.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, you look well though, just seeing you walk back here, you look very well.
<b>PT:</b> Ah. Yes, but the doctor told me that he was concerned about my weight.  He said you're not eating enough.  I said I do eat plenty but now I've been getting on to more cookies and cake and I don't think that's too good because I don't want to gain any weight either. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, he wants you gain some I imagine, right, but he probably wants you to gain the right kind of weight too.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, not just gain from cookies and cakes but from a well balanced diet
<b>PT:</b> I just had some blood work done and he said everything turned out right so that's good for me.
<b>DR:</b> As long as your blood pressure, your cholesterol and your blood sugar and all those things are fine, yknow, he'll be looking out for those too, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Well what are your plans for Christmas?
<b>PT:</b> I'll be with my niece again.  That's the only place I have to go and, uh, uh, I'm the only aunt that she has so she looks forward for me to come up too.
<b>DR:</b> That's up in?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], that'll be nice.  That's a week from today.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Next week on this day.
<b>PT:</b> I was just hoping we would have a good day today so that I could come out and see you because I had an appointment with my cardiologist and I didn't go because they were saying there was supposed to be snow and sleet last week.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And so I was afraid to go out and so I canceled the appointment.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you made it today.  We have kind of a nice sunny day, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And we're all on time. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum and actually early.
<b>PT:</b> Only the last time that I was here, when I went down, the girl called a cab for me to go home and the cab never came till 2 hours later, so now today when, it was a lady that drove me over here in a cab and I asked her if she was going to be around later, yknow, when I'll be getting out and she said well maybe I will be here but now I didn't really think right, I should have asked her to if I need to call up for a cab or if she's going to just come here and I should depend on her.
<b>DR:</b> She was the cab.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Was actually with a cab company?
<b>PT:</b> Not a cab car, she had her own car it looked like to me, it wasn't a yellow cab car.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, okay, was it a set up like a cab, like a meter and all that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she had the meter on it.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, okay.  Well, do you remember which company it was, was it the [DEIDENTIFIED], that one?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that's the one I called for.
<b>DR:</b> That's always easy to remember that phone number.  I imagine you could probably let them know, yknow, that you have a call to them and see, yknow, let them know that you had, uh, a cab ride up to [DEIDENTIFIED] at one o'clock or whenever you left -
<b>PT:</b> One o'clock
<b>DR:</b> Maybe they can find the same person -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Again.
<b>PT:</b> Oh well, I don't know, do you think they could do that for me then?
<b>DR:</b> If you called to order one before, you tell them where you were picked up before -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I bet they could figure it out, yeah, because the dispatch people there keep records.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Of who they send to where.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, she was a very nice girl.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, good.
<b>PT:</b> It's the first time that I rode in a cab with, uh, a girl, that's what I told her, I said I didn't think girls drove cabs and especially nowadays, the streets aren't too safe to be riding around in.
<b>DR:</b> Although that's true for anybody -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Whether they're a man or a woman, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  What are you doing for Christmas?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I'll be with my family.  I work in the morning, I always work in Christmas Day, I go to the hospitals up in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's just a tradition I think because my partners, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and some of the other doctors in the group have kids so I usually work on Christmas Day in the morning seeing people in the hospital, then I get New Years' Day off.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> Then they work New Years' Day but, so they'll be off with their kids but then in the afternoon I go up with my family up in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> My parents come in from out of town and my grandmother is up there and my aunts and uncles.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, good for you, you still have a grandmother yet, huh?
<b>DR:</b> 97.
<b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh.
<b>DR:</b> Yup.
<b>PT:</b> God bless her.  I just hope that doesn't work out for me that way though. 
<b>DR:</b> She's not unhappy.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> There's a lot of things you have to deal with when you get in your 90's that are very different.
<b>PT:</b> I can imagine.  I mean I'm not happy now already.  I think I've lived long enough that I'm satisfied with so I hope that I would never reach an old age.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> We have a Polish saying and a happy birthday song that they wish you 100 years and I always say, no, I don't want no 100 years.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean I guess you never know, I mean hopefully, I'd like to think that there's a reason and you'll never know what that reason is on how long you live until after it's over, so maybe there's a purpose that you'll discover tomorrow or next year as to why, yknow, but to be content whenever it comes is a good thing, that's a good frame of mind to be in no matter how old you are.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> If yknow what I mean.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Do yknow what I mean?  Yknow, if you're okay with life ending at any point, that you're doing the things that you enjoy and living a full life that it can happen at any time.
<b>PT:</b> We never know when that time's going to come.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah or why.
<b>PT:</b> Religion teaches us to always be prepared.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And that if tomorrow comes that you make the best of it, yknow, or use it.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> No matter what your number is or how old you are.  
<b>PT:</b> Well, we just have to wait our time out.  I know my sister in law always used to tell me, she said well you have to be here to be praying for everybody and that's what I'm doing.
<b>DR:</b> And maybe there's, if you look back, there's a reason why you're here for your niece -
<b>PT:</b> Hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, that you're going and spending Christmas with her maybe is destined, yknow, or provides something for her, yknow, or her children.  Does she has children?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She's got 3 and 2 in college now
<b>DR:</b> So if you see them maybe it gives them an impression of what it means to have, yknow, um, someone like a grandmother, yknow, or someone of another generation so you can tell them traditions or stories or be with them at Christmastime, do yknow what I mean.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I don't have anybody else.
<b>DR:</b> They have you.
<b>PT:</b> That's what my niece said, it's good that you're still around, she said because we have nobody else from my family, there's nobody and I had no children so I'm the only one.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then from my niece's husband's side, he was the only child and his father passed away so he only has his mother and all his aunts have passed away to so there's nobody else around.
<b>DR:</b> So you're serving a role in your family.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> By the way that things have happened over time, yknow, that being there, being a part of the tradition or seeing your niece's children is being part of a family.
<b>PT:</b> My niece said, she's telling the children to hurry up and get married so they can have children, that the family will be larger.  She likes a large family and she says that she was always a little bit saddened when she was a little girl because all her friends had family, aunts and uncles and cousins and she said we never had nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Well, but you're there and you have a purpose and a role in your family if you choose to look at it that way.
<b>PT:</b> I try.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and so, hopefully, Christmas will be a good one for you.
<b>PT:</b> I certainly hope so, that all my wishes will come true huh?
<b>DR:</b> Do you have Christmas wishes?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let me see here.  That's right, I took out some extra for you already
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you did.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, I grabbed from the stock room there but I also grabbed some here before.
<b>PT:</b> They're just the kind I use.
<b>DR:</b> That's all 10's, so those are all ones
<b>PT:</b> They're 10's?
<b>DR:</b> Right, so that'll last 2 months in that bag right there.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, then I have to break these in half.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, but then they'll last longer.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I'll give you a few of the 5's too if I can find another bag here.  Actually, yknow what, let's just use one of these bags.  Let me take it out of this one.  Now there's a difference with the boxes, make sure you look at them.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> 5s, 10s have a red tint.
<b>PT:</b> I really appreciate all of your help doctor.
<b>DR:</b> That'll, that'll cover you a while there.  Do you still have some at home too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have a few there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good.  Do you need a prescription for the Doxepin?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, you can give me one, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let's get that and we'll get you another visit set up then too.  And he's giving you the Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, he gave me a prescription for Ativan.
<b>DR:</b> And again, I would just use it sparingly
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> I wouldn't necessarily, if it's a good day -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Don't use it, save it for a bad day.  I hope yknow what I mean.  
<b>PT:</b> There was a time when that didn't help me.  I remember when my husband lived and he had a heart attack and I was so concerned about him that I couldn't sleep at night so ended up not sleeping for 4 nights in a row and the doctor prescribed, each day I called the doctor and told him, I said I'm still not sleeping and I felt very jittery and nervous, so he tried me on all different kind and even the Ativan didn't work.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well Ativan only treats anxiety; it doesn't treat depression or the voices.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and that if you do take it every day, you can get habituated to it, that it can lose it's effectiveness, so it's one only to kind of keep in case of emergencies, yknow, not necessarily to use every day, especially given your falls that you had before too.  I just, I worry, sometimes it can make a person a little uncoordinated too.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It can.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> In that, yknow, if you take more than 1 a day then I would be very, very, very cautious, yknow, if you're going out or walking very far or whatever, okay, so just be very careful with it.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I mean I'm that way, I don't use more than one a day when I do take it and it helps to settle me down that I don't get angry with these voices as much.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, although are you having them at all right now?
<b>PT:</b> Not as much.
<b>DR:</b> How about here in the office today, can you hear them at all today?
<b>PT:</b> No, they didn't talk to me at all while you were talking to me.
<b>DR:</b> Good, excellent, excellent, yeah, because they seem to be worse when you're by yourself, right, when you're not occupied.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, let's see here, uh, 8 weeks is [DATE] but, yknow, let's try to make it a little bit longer.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> Like maybe, well 12 weeks is [DATE], the end of February -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So like the end of February, the beginning of March -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> Should we do that just to avoid February, yknow, and the snow potential and all that.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> How's that sound?
<b>PT:</b> That would be good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> I guess there's always still a potential that day but, yknow what, I think it's better we just move it a little later in February, so instead of being 8 weeks, it'll be 10 weeks, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Are you okay with that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> There should be enough medication there too, so.  Okay, so Tuesday, February 26th at two o'clock.
<b>PT:</b> So you're only here on Tuesdays huh?
<b>DR:</b> And Wednesday mornings early.  I'll turn this off now.
