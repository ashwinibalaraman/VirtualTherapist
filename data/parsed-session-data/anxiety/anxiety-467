BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Um, okay.  Yknow, it's been a while.  What's been happening with you?
<b>PT:</b> Well.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, actually, before you tell me, let me just write, yes, go ahead.  
<b>PT:</b> I started out, um, well, I finished the chemo like, two or three weeks ago and just before I finished it, they told me that it was um, I had um, that I was anemic and also had a high white blood count and high red blood count.  And I went to the PET scan subsequent to finishing the chemo and the oncologist suggests that she wanted me to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> They looked very what?
<b>PT:</b> They looked very good.
<b>DR:</b> They looked good.  Good.
<b>PT:</b> And I should stay with [INAUDIBLE], in the meanwhile, the anemia and the white blood cells [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How's your energy level now?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my energy has been pretty awful.  Uh, uh, it has been for quite -
<b>DR:</b> You're dragging all day, every day.
<b>PT:</b> Months and months and months and months and months.
<b>DR:</b> You're dragging all day, every day.
<b>PT:</b> No, just the medication.  I take the Provigil, which does help me.  It does help.
<b>DR:</b> Do you pay out of pocket for that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I, yeah, well, [INAUDIBLE] blood flow and the hole in the donut and we pay, uh.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so, uh, you have to pay in between.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right.  And you pay a fortune.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause it's like ten dollars a pill or something.  It's very expensive.
<b>PT:</b> Very expensive, very expensive.  It's more than ten dollars a pill.  But, then, the outlet, I also, uh, uh, you prescribed, the last thing you prescribed, and I want to.
<b>DR:</b> Well, all right, I saw you [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I saw you the following.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It was mostly your energy drive.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] on the phone.
<b>DR:</b> You were just dragging.  You could barely, I mean, you couldn't get in here and you.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] that day.
<b>DR:</b> You were drained, very drained.  But, the good part was your mood wasn't so terrible.
<b>PT:</b> It wasn't terrible.  It's just I didn't sleep well.
<b>DR:</b> Right and at that point, we only had you only on Provigil.
<b>PT:</b> No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'm looking at [DATE], sorry.  What have you been on?
<b>PT:</b> Well, you prescribed something which is kind of like a kind of amphetamine.
<b>DR:</b> Dexadrine or Ritalin?
<b>PT:</b> No, neither one.  It's just a, a, it was like a really [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Vivactil?
<b>PT:</b> Pardon me?
<b>DR:</b> Vivactil?
<b>PT:</b> No, it was like amphetamine in the name of it.
<b>DR:</b> Dextroamphetamine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, Dexadrine.
<b>PT:</b> Now I didn't take it.  I'll tell you why, because you said amphetamine and I'm always.
<b>DR:</b> You remember the old days when amphetamines were, um.
<b>PT:</b> Were speed, speed, speed.
<b>DR:</b> Right, speed.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, this is in a controlled way.  I mean the larger reason to have some concern is heart issues, but your heart's okay, right?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my heart, it's so so.  No, my heart is okay, but [INAUDIBLE] have chemo with my heart doctor.  I had, uh, uh, three angioplasties and the second time around, I had a heart attack on the table at the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And so that gives us cause in using the medicine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, it shouldn't give you a heart attack.  I get a little concerned about raising your blood pressure and heart rate.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> But we would just monitor that.
<b>PT:</b> I take something called Micardis, which is, I mean I don't [INAUDIBLE] it's another heart medication.  I take it, but it says it's for high blood pressure.  I don't have high blood pressure, but I take it.  My blood pressure's fine, [INAUDIBLE], but, uh, I have to watch my blood sugars.
<b>DR:</b> Hold on.  So, you did not use the Dexadrine.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I mean, that's one of the big reasons that.
<b>DR:</b> I also gave you Ritalin.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Because you, you, you did not.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I have here that we mailed the prescription.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, you mailed it to me and then we discussed it before I should go get it filled [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, Dexadrine is a bit bigger than Ritalin.  But you didn't use it any way.
<b>PT:</b> No, I wasn't going to use the amphetamine pill [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, you said you were not able to do anything.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You can't move.  Tell me about how you're doing.  What's your mood like right now?  Short answer, what's your mood like?
<b>PT:</b> So so.
<b>DR:</b> So so is not an answer.
<b>PT:</b> That's French.
<b>DR:</b> Mood is happy, sad, anxious, irritable.  What's your mood like?
<b>PT:</b> Anxious.
<b>DR:</b> Most of the time?  All day?  Every day?  You're anxious?  I'm going to put here your mood's okay because you look good.  Your mood looks pretty good.  You don't always have the words for your moods.  Do you know this about yourself?
<b>PT:</b> I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> It's not so easy for me to describe your internal state.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But you look pretty good to me.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> And I know you pretty well, for, uh, seven years now.
<b>PT:</b> My God, it's that long?
<b>DR:</b> So, your mood is okay, but you have some anxiety and what's the anxiety from?
<b>PT:</b> My anxiety's [INAUDIBLE] and at the same time, I have to do [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You have anxiety over your function.
<b>PT:</b> Functions.
<b>DR:</b> Over your inability to function.
<b>PT:</b> My inability to function.  Additionally, I, I, uh, I had said to myself that I'll go to [DEIDENTIFIED] when I finish the chemo and doctor said okay, but then in the interim period I had gone to the eye doctor, and this is not exactly a surprise to me, I had cataracts and the eye doctor said both your cataracts are ripe now and I'll be getting them done and [INAUDIBLE] and get the other one done [INAUDIBLE].  Sure you can wait a month, yknow.  So, I mean, you can make up one simple [INAUDIBLE] go to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then get my eyes done, or get my eyes done and then go to [DEIDENTIFIED], yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> What's the big deal?  [INAUDIBLE] functioning [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Like paying bills on time.  
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And is that because you have no energy?
<b>PT:</b> Partially.  [INAUDIBLE] energy.  I work every day in the yard for about.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's talk before then.  What time do you get to sleep at night?
<b>PT:</b> Eleven.
<b>DR:</b> And you're able to get to sleep with no problem?
<b>PT:</b> A little bit, 'cause [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So you crash.  And then you sleep a good solid eight hours or so?
<b>PT:</b> I sleep and I know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How many hours do you sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Um, until I have the urgency of urination around seven o'clock.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so a good eight hours
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> So you have eight solid hours.  And in the morning, do you feel rested?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I guess so, yeah.  I, I.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> No, no, I go right back to sleep unless I take one of the Provigils.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So you try to take the Provigil early.
<b>PT:</b> I take it every day early [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Good.  To try and juice up the system.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And then your energy is decent for how long?
<b>PT:</b> A couple of hours.
<b>DR:</b> So you get a few good hours.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then what?  Do you take a nap?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yes, I do, unless I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And so, during those hours, do you get out in the garden?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b> And are you able to concentrate okay?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Do you read?
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's part of it, I can read poorly because I, I don't read the way I used to, like I'll be reading an article in the [DEIDENTIFIED] or the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't finish it.  I'll have to go back to it a couple of hours later.  I haven't read.
<b>DR:</b> Because you're distracted.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know why.  Uh, uh, uh, I can't, I don't read a book in [INAUDIBLE].  A real book, yknow, uh, uh, my, um, I'm not [INAUDIBLE] that much with anything except reading.  I don't, um.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean?  So, there's no rituals, um, you still get stuck, though.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I get mad.
<b>DR:</b> And that's your intentional style.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> But you don't have obsessive rituals, right, like checking, or things like that.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> My appetite is good, pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have any suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> Nope. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless? 
<b>PT:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The dysfunction.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not hopeless or helpless.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to get pleasure?  Do you enjoy the gardening?
<b>PT:</b> I enjoy things, yes.  Like, like [INAUDIBLE] Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b> Good, so you, you're socially engaged.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No, a few months ago, you were.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> So, you're far, far better than you were.
<b>PT:</b> Well, my social calendar is not exactly [INAUDIBLE] I can mix and mingle.  I even went to fireworks in [DEIDENTIFIED] on Tuesday night.  They had them on the 16th [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Where were the fireworks?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] and they [INAUDIBLE], and they didn't get them [INAUDIBLE] until the 16th as opposed to the 4th, so after the, after the concert, they had fireworks.  Okay?
<b>DR:</b> Who'd you go with?
<b>PT:</b> I walked down to the corner, there was my neighbor and [INAUDIBLE] and, uh, and uh, because it was not, it could have been or shoulda been, 'cause everybody [INAUDIBLE], the fireworks.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> And the kids were running around like crazy screaming [INAUDIBLE] because the kids all came for fireworks.
<b>DR:</b> How much, uh, Provigil are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> I take like a [INAUDIBLE], I'll take one in the morning and I'll take one like around two o'clock.  If I forget to take it, if I don't take it [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking any other medicines for me?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, no.  I take water pills.  And I take, uh, Micardis, like I said.  
<b>DR:</b> So how many Provigil all day?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, two.  Uh, uh, once or twice I've taken three, but mostly it's just two.  If I remember to take the second one.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so between one and two.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you think that's enough or not quite enough?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I think two, I should be taking two, uh, the refills, I got a little bit left [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let me check your, uh, blood pressure.  Has your pressure been okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let me help you up.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to do just the wrist.  
<b>PT:</b> The oncologist [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The best doctor in the world.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] magazine.  Yeah, yeah.  [INAUDIBLE] my blood sugar.
<b>DR:</b> I've not seen you in a long, long time.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Because you couldn't get here.  'Cause you had no energy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I absolutely, [INAUDIBLE] I was like [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Perfect, 123/73.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And your pulse is 89.
<b>PT:</b> 89.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine.  And you have no chest pain or anything like that, right?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> And no arrhythmia?  
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And no atrial fibrillation?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I [INAUDIBLE].  And I hadn't seen my cardiologist in a long time.  At first, [INAUDIBLE] the oncologist [INAUDIBLE] see the cardiologist next week.
<b>DR:</b> You are.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  And you hadn't seen him also because you couldn't get the energy up?
<b>PT:</b> No, because [INAUDIBLE] before I went to see the oncologist.  He, she, the cardiologist was [INAUDIBLE] and she said [INAUDIBLE].  The guy that did the operation was a completely different person [INAUDIBLE] the operation.  And the only advantage of going to the oncologist [INAUDIBLE], uh, I couldn't see the [INAUDIBLE], I couldn't see, a mirror I had in the bathroom on the wall, I have in my house, I couldn't see the front of my head, yknow, you can look over your back.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But [INAUDIBLE].  It's a mirror.
<b>DR:</b> Does he have a mirror [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> He has a mirror, yknow, in the office, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I can see myself [INAUDIBLE].  That, I don't understand one [INAUDIBLE] thing that [INAUDIBLE].  They gGive me stuff, they gave me stuff I didn't use my [INAUDIBLE].  I didn't [INAUDIBLE].  I knew I [INAUDIBLE].  But like I didn't lose a lot.  Just like [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  And I said [INAUDIBLE], I'm not worried about that.  This looks like I just got my [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, when did you finish the course?
<b>PT:</b> About two weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b> So, two weeks ago.
<b>PT:</b> I had the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It looks like you dried up all those advanced cells.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you should be okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you feeling much better now that you're not doing the chemo?
<b>PT:</b> Yes and no.  I wish I had [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> But you're not depressed again.  Are you?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> Even though you're not on anti depressants.
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no.  See.
<b>DR:</b> Are you on any anti depressants?  I, I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You're just on [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Eh, the eh, the water pills.  The em, eh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So, so, if it's isolated energy without all of the mood and [INAUDIBLE] concentration, without the whole range of suppressive symptoms, then it's not depression.
<b>PT:</b> I was thinking [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Although, sometimes [INAUDIBLE] energy, I don't think, I mean, the one that's most energizing is Wellbutrin, but I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No, but you're depressed then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But now you're not depressed.  Now we just want energy meds for ya.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And, yknow, to be honest, [INAUDIBLE] Provigil.
<b>PT:</b> I should try the amphetamine stuff to see [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Did you get it filled?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, I did, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you have it at home?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, take half a pill, just see how you feel.
<b>PT:</b> You prescribed it at two a day.
<b>DR:</b> No, I just did that so you'd get a lot of pills.  I don't want you to take that.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no.
<b>DR:</b> Just half a pill.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's a level above Provigil.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You may not feel [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But, you're so wiped out of energy.  You're so, man, out of energy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This is the rocket fuel.  I mean, this is the stuff that [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> It really is.  The only problem is it wears off.  Now, in some people, the morning dose is enough.  Other people need a small afternoon dose.  You'll probably need the small afternoon dose.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It'll wear off, or it might wear off at two, three, four in the afternoon, and for that, you would take another small dose around noon or one.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> What most people do with your energy problem is have it right next to the bed in the morning, try to get them on board just when you open your eyes so it'll start working and you'll feel.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, classic side effects.
<b>PT:</b> I know that, I know [INAUDIBLE], too.
<b>DR:</b> Very high.
<b>PT:</b> And the chemo makes it high.
<b>DR:</b> But you're not anemic now, right?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, the anemia signs, [INAUDIBLE] and the red blood, too, were starting to get back to normal so I figured [INAUDIBLE].  Actually, I had a conversation socially with a young woman at the doctor who had [INAUDIBLE], she had stomach problems and lung and she was describing how she [INAUDIBLE] and she felt like she didn't want to do a damn thing [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> She lost her motivation.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You're more complicated though because you've had a long, chronic history of depression.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> And the funny part is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And we've had you on anti depressants for years.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] she was funny, she's laughing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In fact, [INAUDIBLE] and my friend [INAUDIBLE] she and her husband, we went on [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you had a bunch of stops and.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> She took it all the way from up in the [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, right down in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so you went to [DEIDENTIFIED].  You walked the cross over to the certain line area?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>  You can if you have a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all my life was crossing there so I crossed and we go to [INAUDIBLE] and we had a nice [INAUDIBLE] lunch and a little [INAUDIBLE] and then we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] with them.
<b>DR:</b> By boat?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we used the water taxi.  You call them down and like you get on.  [INAUDIBLE].  They stopped at um, um, this, eh, underneath the [DEIDENTIFIED], the restaurant there, the, um.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, the fancy restaurant.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So you just stay on it, enjoy the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> How much does it cost?
<b>PT:</b> Well, [INAUDIBLE] the weekend, [INAUDIBLE], fifteen dollars.
<b>DR:</b> Did you like it?
<b>PT:</b> Well, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And as far up as it goes is [DEIDENTIFIED]?  It doesn't go any higher?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, um, yeah, actually [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And we went over to [DEIDENTIFIED] and got off.
<b>DR:</b> There's rocks.
<b>PT:</b> No, not [DEIDENTIFIED].  What do you call it, um, uh, it's in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Right, it's eh, in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> So, it goes down, then, south.
<b>PT:</b> It goes south, and then.
<b>DR:</b> But it doesn't go north?
<b>PT:</b> It goes south.  Eh, it doesn't go north past [DEIDENTIFIED].  And, it eh, eh, the, eh [INAUDIBLE], [DEIDENTIFIED], [DEIDENTIFIED] and then you end up, stay on and we did go back to where we left the tour.  But I mean, so like.
<b>DR:</b> How long did you have to wait for it [INAUDIBLE] to come?
<b>PT:</b> About twenty minutes.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] on the bridges.  In the winter, can you do it in the winter?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, [INAUDIBLE], but it was [INAUDIBLE] looks like a little row boat taxi.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] to [DEIDENTIFIED] for this whole [INAUDIBLE].  Eh, which they might [INAUDIBLE] and you're looking at, uh, the [DEIDENTIFIED].  The Dutch had actually [INAUDIBLE].  So you're looking at, uh.
<b>DR:</b> That's where their settlement was?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Of course, they had, the Dutch people had it but [INAUDIBLE] the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE - PATIENT LAUGHTER].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  So, actually, so I [INAUDIBLE] staring at the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I always wanted to [INAUDIBLE].  But, who wants to model for the, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED]?  [INAUDIBLE].  I totally loved it.  [INAUDIBLE].  And I said [INAUDIBLE] and I said I think [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] know the answer to it.
<b>PT:</b> They didn't even know the answer.  But the funny point, another person [INAUDIBLE] was listening to her radio late in the afternoon and they come on the radio and said we were wrong.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I'm gonna do it.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um, and cheap, too, for a day of entertainment.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Then we had lunch.  I only spent about thirty five dollars [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well listen, you're definitely not depressed.  You know, the energy we'll just work on.  The Dexedrine is really good stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] too much.  If it's uncomfortable, just give me a call.
<b>PT:</b> Fine, yeah.  And when shall I see you again?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, about two months.
