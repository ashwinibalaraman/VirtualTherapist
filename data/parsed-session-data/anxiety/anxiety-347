I knew how it felt to need asylum from life; I
understood a little of Don's desperate longing for
safety from himself and others. At times a hospital, in
spite of all its terrors, is the only place left to run.
Two days had passed since I'd left home for the hospital,
carrying nothing that would give me away
if he unexpectedly drove past me on his way
home, early and angry. I felt pursued, sure
he would grab me and hurt me just as I
made the hospital doors. None of
this happened, and I made it into the
hospital, into the ward that would be my
only home for the next five months.
I had many of the same prejudices "normal"
people carry about mental illness. I'd seen
<i>Psycho</i> and all the television portrayals of
the dangers and unpredictability of crazy
people; I'd read <i>The Snake</i> Pit and thought I
had an understanding of the consequences of

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I barely left my room, I spoke as little as I could get
away with to my roommate, whom I kept expecting to
change abruptly from a harmless-looking woman to a
raving lunatic with an imagined grievance against me
that she would correct with wild force.


I was impressed that there were no bars on the windows
of the fourth-floor psychiatric ward, until I tried
opening them and found they were designed to open
only a scant few inches. The obvious reason sent cold
chills down my back. The doors that couldn't be
watched from the vantage point of the glassed-in nurses'
station were wired with emergency alarms.


Nurses weren't in uniform, but it was obvious who
were the staff and who were the patients. The staff
seemed to dress as though they were going off to a fashion
show right after work; they were made-up, perfumed,
often high-heeled. When they walked, it was
easy to hear the muted jangle of keys. Patients' rooms
were in a semicircle ending on each side of the nurses'
station, which in turn faced the dayroom/dining room.


I was unable to relax. I kept waiting for the axe to fall,
for him to track me down and drag me bodily out, back
home. My nerves were stretched even further than they
had been, my hands shook constantly, I couldn't sleep or
eat. Even breathing, no longer a simple mechanical
reflex, took exhausting physical concentration. No
medications were offered or asked for; it seemed they

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was eighteen, legally free, legally independent, but
without money, or job skills, or a place to go. I was
bereft of any future, a simple fugitive from the nuclear
family. I had left a note, not mentioning the hospital,
uselessly requesting that no one try to locate me, promising
to get in touch once I was settled elsewhere.


It would be difficult for an outsider to appreciate the
enormity of my action. I had an acute awareness of the
scene I'd left the others to deal with at home, although I
tried, constantly, to block out that awareness. I was the
first defector, the first to run outside, the first to crack
the foundation and façade of the "family" home, the
first to "tell." My younger sister had run away a few
times, staying with friends, but going to no outsider,
enlisting no aid. When she returned, he beat her, shaved
her head. My older sister once ran in hysterical panic to
a neighbour, who called my parents and reported her
"exaggerated stories;" she was brutally beaten upon her
return. No one told. We gave up, almost without a
fight. My youngest sister bitterly, vividly, recalls a time
when he caught her walking with a black kid and
started beating her right out on the street. A disgusted
man yelled from his balcony that if he had to do that
sort of thing, "at least have the decency to do it at
home, not in front of everybody!"


He ruled us with absolute authority, never challenged,

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the afternoon of the third day, as I sat, knees up to
my chest, on the hospital bed, Armageddon walked in
unannounced. It was one of the many times in my life
when I knew it was perfectly possible to die from fear.
He sat down beside me on the bed while I flinched further
into the headboard. I wouldn't look at him. His
first words were in modulated tones, dripping with
disappointment, hurt, kindliness, with undertones
promising forgiveness.


"Oh, Pat, why did you do this to your family? You
don't belong here, with all these crazy people. You don't
need to hurt us like this. Your mother is very upset. She
won't stop crying. Won't even talk to me unless you
come home.... I'm sure you don't want to do this to
us, to your mom, your sisters, your brother. Whatever it
is, we can work it out, I promise."


A classic rabbit-snake confrontation; although this
rabbit refused to look into his eyes, his voice was having
the same mesmerizing effect. I was feeling guilt, cutting,
acid-burning guilt. I was once again the bad child who
didn't deserve to be trusted, hurting once again the
long-suffering father who sought only peace.


I said nothing. I was frantic for escape, hoping a
doctor or nurse would walk in and rescue me, wondering
how long he would stick to persuasion before
his temper took over.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You don't have any idea what they'll do to you
here. Drugs, shock-treatment, operations on your
brain. You don't want to be like these zombies, do
you?"


Yes, I wanted to scream at him, anything, anything
is better than going back with you.


"Bathroom," I mumbled, and ran; another singular
act of courage that sure didn't look it. I'd never dared
run from him before; the consequences were
unthinkable. Into the hall, running, into the nurses'
station where I collapsed against a wall, crouching
low, hands clamped over my ears to block out his
voice, still echoing in my brain. This seemed to cause
a flurry of activity to which I paid no attention.
Voices, first puzzled, then annoyed, rained down
on me. Time passed somehow; I didn't move a
muscle.


"Pat, he's gone now. I want you to return to your
room."


Magic words. I looked up into a tight, unpleasant
face.


"Come now, stop this ridiculous behaviour." She
was tugging at my arm. I rose, shakily, and she
escorted me back. I could, even through my turmoil,
pick up her anger.


"How could you jeopardize the doctor's career like
this? He tries to help you, and you lie to him."


Lie?


"He, we, could be sued. You had no business
telling him you were eighteen."

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found my voice, though it sounded weak to me.
"I am eighteen."


"You're seventeen. You can't sign yourself in at
seventeen."


"I'm eighteen!"


"Do you have proof?"


Of course I didn't. She glared at me, her judgment
vindicated, and left me alone.


They're going to hand me over, they're going to
make me go back, oh God, they believe him, they'll
let him take me. Wild scenes played in my head:
jumping out of the car while he was driving, running
from the ward before he was notified ...


They gave me an injection some time during the
night, and in the morning the psychiatrist came to
talk to me. He had set up a meeting with my parents
for that day. He had no questions about my age or
whether I had lied, and seemed very annoyed when I
told him what fears the nurse had provoked. He was
a very persuasive man, and although I had no idea
what he talked about with them, my parents did sign
the papers before they left that day. I only had to
spend two minutes in the office with them and the
shrink, just long enough to hear my father's
diagnosis.


"You know what, Pat?" he said, still playing the
role of the reasonable father. "You've always been a
tomboy, even in the way you dress. I think your
problem is penis envy."


I never replied.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'd grown used to feeling from adults outside
my home the same bruising judgments
about who and what I was that I'd heard daily from
my father. Not until late in high school did anyone in a
position of authority ever lead me to believe I was any
better than the slow, untrustworthy, ungrateful child I
knew myself to be.


One day, in grade eleven, I was summoned to the
vice-principal's office by the school secretary's voice,
broken up and crackling over the intercom. I hadn't
done anything I was aware of to warrant such a
summons, but I immediately felt guilty and scared; the
office had those connotations for every student.
Although the principal had a soft reputation as a
public-relations figurehead, the vice-principal was the
object of fear and the target for maliciously descriptive
nicknames.


I knocked on his closed door, heard a kind of grunt
and walked in, trying to project an aura of confidence
and curiosity. My stomach was fluttering, my palms felt a
bit slippery, but since he made no move to shake my
hand that seemed an irrelevant detail. I had never talked
to him before but I was very aware of who he was.


At the end of the tenth grade, I had been surprised
and gratified to be elected editor of the school paper for
the upcoming academic year by its student staff. With a
handful of others, I had worked over the summer to
prepare an issue that could be printed by the school and
distributed in late September. The vice-principal had

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He was abrupt, to the point.


"You will not be the editor of the school paper. I am
quite aware of the kind of yellow journalism you would
produce, and we won't have that here. I will inform the
staff adviser to call new elections."


I was stunned. I had never expected this.


"I was elected."


"You can go now."


I stood very still, staring at him in confused anger.


"Can you tell me what you find objec—"


"I said go back to your class!"


It was the same as being at home: no explanations, no
fairness, just a statement that I was not good enough,
that I would mess things up. I reached for the paper and
he exploded. He stormed over to his door and opened it
so aggressively that it bounced off the office wall.


I took the hint and left. I was in turmoil.


I had gained some small notoriety in my last school
from a weekly column I wrote for the local paper, <i>The
Victory</i>. It was published with my own picture and byline
and the embarrassing tide "Teen Talk." I hadn't been
happy at the school, but neither had I been anonymous.
For reasons I've never understood, my vulnerability tended
to increase with the degree of invisibility I felt.

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next year we moved to a more suburban community,
and a new, bigger school, with five thousand
students. I spent the first few nervous months
surrounded by clouds of anxiety. Although I had no
positive proof that other students were even aware of
me, I couldn't shake the feeling that they were ridiculing
me just out of my hearing.


My fortunes turned dramatically the day I was
stopped in the hall by an English teacher. He'd heard
about my writing from another teacher, who had
enjoyed my essays and encouraged me to write for the
school paper. I'd submitted two rather heavy pieces
which he'd shared with this second teacher. I was startled
to be singled out for praise and attention, and
amazed when he asked <i>me</i> to help do a rewrite of <i>Bye
Bye Birdy</i> for a school production he planned to put on.


I was so thrilled, I replayed the conversation in my
head for days after. He'd looked at me with interest and
respect; he'd asked for my help. This was quite at odds
with how I was treated at home. In what seemed no
time at all, I was accepted into a group of intelligent,
creative kids who weren't ashamed to read, who had
some awareness of world affairs, who were bright,
attractive and funny. I found myself being invited into
homes of teachers and homes of students, places where
people seemed genuinely to like and support each other,
where kids didn't run when their fathers reached for
them, where the mothers didn't look ground-down,
where the atmosphere was light, not oppressive.


What happened next is that the two pieces I submitted

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now, as I retreated from the administration office, I
wondered if this latest attack could be a belated
backlash.


After my disastrous meeting with the vice-principal,
I wandered around the now crowded and
boisterous halls until I found Brian, the teacher/adviser
who had resigned from the paper the year before. I was
almost afraid to tell him what had just occurred, feeling
he might blame me for messing up. Instead, he
exploded, "Christ, that stupid bastard. Don't worry, Pat,
leave it with me."


Although still shaken, I was relieved and happy that
he had exploded not at me, but for me. These were the
days when student politics was coming into its own,
sparked by books such as <i>The Student as Nigger</i> and by
"the war that wasn't" in Vietnam, by the desire of some
educators and students to make the curriculum offered
in schools more relevant and to end oppressive conformity,
marked by both uniforms and uniform thinking.
Days that saw the spawning of free, alternative schools,

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Over the next days and weeks, the situation with the
paper escalated, with no compromise offered by the
administration. A meeting was called of students
involved in the production of the school paper and
everyone resigned. There was no authorized paper that
year. It was my first experience of group action and
group loyalty, one I have never forgotten. The braver
students joined me to produce an underground paper,
which we clandestinely distributed in the corridors. No
names were signed, but since the first issue contained
the two censored pieces, the administration and department
heads were left in no doubt as to who was
responsible.


At the same time, I was one of a number of high
school students being politicized by undergraduates
from Sir George Williams University, now part of
Concordia. As a result, I was subjected to what I now
recognize as a campaign of harassment by the administration.
I hated school uniforms, and wore one as infrequently
as possible. Every day, the administration would
call to my homeroom over the intercom, demanding to
know whether Miss Capponi was in full uniform or not.
My homeroom teacher held a vote every morning, and
the students always declared unanimously that I was in
uniform, no matter what I was wearing. It became a
very strange game, taking on surrealistic overtones.


For some months, towards the end of the eleventh

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We brought out a second issue of our underground
paper, and one of the English teachers took exception to
a piece criticizing the present, rather restrictive,
curriculum. He accosted me in the hall outside his
office and dragged me by my arm through the stacks of
books on shelves in his office. He read off titles in rapid
fire, sarcastically demanding if I'd bothered to read each
book. What he interpreted as smart-ass replies were in
fact true; I had read the majority of them. I was by now
a voracious reader, this being my major escape from the
turmoil at home.


I was eighteen now, older than most of the students.
I'd spent three years streamed into a vocational program
(the "dumb" class, it was called) and in order to get back
into academic I'd been required to do grades nine and
ten over again. But my age was no protection against the
threats of others or my own fears.


The Sir George undergraduates were organizing a
city-wide school walkout to protest the slowness of change
and the stubbornness of some of the administrators. I had

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As with our first meeting, he wasted no time.


"Any school walkout would be viewed most seriously,
Miss Capponi. Students participating would probably be
suspended. As for yourself ... well ..." His voice took
on a deceptively sympathetic tone, belied by his smug
expression. "... I am aware that your father believes in
old-world discipline. I would hate to have to call him and
tell him you were in danger of being expelled. I would
hate to think of the consequences to you."


My tightrope was on the verge of snapping.


I knew that my two sisters, both younger, were
frequently sent to school with obvious bruises and
abrasions from beatings at home. I knew, too, that a
sympathetic guidance counsellor had tried to probe, but
my sisters avoided him, aware of the consequences "telling"
brought. No one had ever intervened, ever rescued
us. Now this man, this man in authority over five thousand
students each year, was using my father's violence
to control and straitjacket me.


The events of this final year of high school represented
my first rebellion against blind authority, my first
time to fight back, my first time to gain some selfrespect.
Now, if I did what I believed to be right, calling
the students out, I would be in terrible danger at home.
If I didn't call the strike, I would be acting in a cowardly
way, giving in one more time. Instead of fighting back,

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I stopped going to school, found myself pacing endlessly
at home while both my parents were at work,
crying frequently, desiring to run away from all that was
destructive in my life. <i>My history of frequent hospitalizations
was about to begin</i>.

At the house, cheque day had come and
gone, but there were still dribs and drabs of wine
and a few quarters for coffee. People sat around in
the common room, watching the card players, listening
to the occasional jibes and bad jokes, waiting for supper
time.


The front door crashed open and Dennis, who called
himself Elvis and most of the time believed he was, ran
in, panting, sweating and panicked. He stood in front of
our makeshift card table (a three-legged dining-room
discard), his back to the open door, trembling and on
the verge of hysteria.


"Pat, these kids ... I was singing on the corner, my
corner, my corner, and they were all around me, calling
me names, buggin' me and pulling on my clothes."
Although Dennis was in his thirties, his mental age was
about the same as that of the kids, and he often found
himself the butt of people's sadistic tendencies.


He gulped in the stale air, bursting simultaneously
into tears and hiccups. Behind him, where the bright
sunshine stopped right at the front stoop as though

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I ran," he continued, "but they chased me, they
threw stones, they hit me!"


A skinny boy in a torn T-shirt and jeans was shoved
inside by the three others with him, all boys no more
than ten years old. He whirled around to face the
others, small fists clenched, angry, scared, caught out.
Reassured that he hadn't been swallowed up, the other
boys then slipped in beside him, whispering insults and
curses at one another. The first boy swiped at his nose
with the back of his hand, and, to regain his lost status,
led them deeper into the house, one entity with eight
legs. I watched them while Dennis, oblivious to the
presence of his tormentors, continued to choke and
sputter, trying to get through his story.


The children's faces were flushed, their eyes
overbright. It was obvious they were wild with the thrill
of hunting an adult — sure, he was a "crazy retard," but
he was still a grown-up, and they had made the weird fat
man run and thrash out and blubber like a baby.


Dennis, at first unable to hear anything but his own
ragged breathing, finally looked over his shoulder,
gasped and ran to the back of the table, grabbing onto
my shoulder with one palsied hand. The room went
dead. Nine tenants, and no one spoke, no one would
look at the intruders. The cards lay forgotten on the
table as the kids wandered around the room, snickering,
elbowing each other.


I was struck by the same paralysis as everyone else, the

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shook my head to shake off the strange spell and
stood up, advancing on the children, speaking as gruffly
as I could manage.


"Get the hell out of here, and leave this man alone!"


Of course the kids ran, the first boy turning back
briefly to swear at me before running to catch his
friends. Mavis cleared her throat and picked up her
cards. Alice struggled to her feet, announcing she was
ready for a nap. Dennis let out a massive sigh.


"You know, they had me so scared, I couldn't
breathe, and one of the stones got me on my back."


He held his hand against his chest to quell the panic. I
could see he was working himself into a state, so I asked
him to sing one of Elvis's songs. Dennis never refused to
sing, no matter what the circumstances. He struck his
Elvis pose, legs apart, knees bent in baggy pants, one
clenched fist close to his mouth, his face scrunched up
into what he felt was a romantic expression, and sang.

Mornings in the dining room were the least
explosive of the three meals, and the most ugly.
The dining room was supposed to be open from
seven to nine, depending on how much Jack had had to
drink the night before. Two large boxes of puffed wheat,
three loaves of bread, a dripping, sticky jar of jam,

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because breakfast was spread out over two hours, the
residents didn't all show up at once; tables held two or
three people at most. Those who woke after seven-thirty
took their time, knowing the coffee had already
been drained dry.


The occupants of the dining room at breakfast were
almost all male, driven out of their beds by the constant
hunger pangs created and enhanced by anti-psychotic
medications. The women would dribble in around
lunch time, except for a few morning regulars. If
there was absolutely no hope of getting coffee any other
way, I would be there too. There was no conversation,
no laughter, just a kind of shovelling back and not
tasting.


Jack sat enthroned and alone at the table by the
curtainless picture window. From there, he nursed his
coffee and his bitterness, staring out the window,
occasionally yelling back at someone not to <i>do</i> or <i>be</i>
something. No one intruded at his table without an
invitation, and most averted their eyes from him, not
wanting to provoke a diatribe on the uselessness in this
world.


I had yet to really meet Jack, having missed him the
few mornings I joined the men at breakfast. He was
polite to me at the supper line-up, which in itself was

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day, a month or so after my arrival, I came in
around 7:15, looked at the people crowded around the
coffee pot and was just turning away, discouraged, when
Jack yelled to me.


"Well, good morning to you, Pat! C'mon over and sit
with me, I'll get you a coffee. What do you take?"


I sat down with a pleased "double-double," though
that pleasure was short-lived as I watched him bully and
elbow his way to the percolator. He came back and
placed two cups on the table, cheerful for some reason.


"I keep meaning to talk to you, but you're in and out
so fast ... every time I get around to looking for you,
you're gone. Not that I blame you, who wants to sit and
watch these animals?" I had a feeling that this was going
to be a very expensive cup of coffee for my self-image
and self-respect. He offered me a cigarette, which I
accepted (in for a penny, in for a pound), while he
continued.


"The owner asked me to keep an eye on you when
you first came in, not that I needed telling. I knew right
away you weren't one of these deadbeats any more than
I am. You have an education, Haddie tells me. That's
good, it should get you outta here." He always talked
loudly, making no effort to spare anyone's feelings or
sensitivities.


I was feeling more and more traitorous. The only
thing, besides the coffee and cigarettes, that kept me
there was a realization that Jack was definitely one of us,

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Barry, get the fuck away from the toaster! That little
bastard, one day I'll just pick him up and heave him out
the door! Listen, Pat, would you like me to fry you up
some eggs? I keep my own stash, a little bacon, too."


I could just see myself trying to eat such a Sunday
breakfast in front of the other tenants.


"No, thanks a lot, but I can't stand to look at food in
the morning. I appreciate the offer, and I sure as hell
appreciate the coffee."


He was up very quickly, gathering the cups and
disappearing into the kitchen with a hollered "Just wait
a second, I'll make us some more!"


Miss Pattison tiptoed in, gathering up crusts of bread
and leftover soggy cereal, all in the same bowl. Jack
came back from the kitchen, passed her, rolled his eyes
and let out a long-suffering gush of air.


"Senile old bat!"


Miss Pattison hugged her treasure, glared at him and
took herself off to feed the pigeons, cats or sparrows —
or whoever was starved enough to eat the leftovers from
this basket.


The coffee was a good, strong instant, likely from
another stash. It tasted a lot more real than the watered-down
stuff in the perc. I complimented him and he
smiled, genuinely pleased. We sat in good silence, for
me relieved silence, watching the thick rush-hour traffic

When my mind returned to it, the room was almost
empty. Ruth had come in and was making her way
through the dining room, gathering up a spoon here, a
bowl there, dragging out as long as possible her only
activity — clean-up and dishwashing after every meal.
Puffed wheat and crusts of toast crunched under her
feet, remnants of the meal the experts call "the most
important of the day."


As I thanked him again and rose to leave, Jack invited
me to come back to his room and see him "any time."


"I usually have a few beer lying around somewhere,
as long as I can keep Haddie away from them."


I shook his hand, this bulky bully of a man, and told
him he would be seeing me. I was curious about him,
what had caused him to be such a bastard, how he'd
come to rule this pathetic kingdom, and why he was
tolerated here.


It was clouding over as I stepped outside. The traffic
was thinning out. Barely nine o'clock, the whole day
ahead of me, and absolutely nothing to do. I stood there
until the rain started, sending me back upstairs until
lunch, when Gary, or Delores, or some of the others
would be getting up and we'd play cards, or just be
bored together.


My room was not a bad place in the daytime. I quite
liked it. I was used to the bed, the garish colour of the
walls, the subdued light. I was even getting used to the

On my way downstairs to check on an ailing
Gary, I overheard the sounds of prayer coming
from Miss Pattison's room. Her door was wide
open. The beds had been shoved together to make
room for a small row of kitchen chairs lined up before a
makeshift altar.


"Miss Pattison, Bertha and old Alice sat primly, hands
folded in their laps, staring at their transfigured dresser. I
stared too: it was draped with clean white sheets and
topped with candles in wine bottles, chalices and prayer
books that a thin young man in a priest's outfit was fussily
arranging. I recognized immediately that this must
be Phoney Father Francis, who I'd heard about but
never met. Apparently he'd been travelling, courtesy of
Miss Pattison's largesse. The outfit and other religious
items were stolen during a break-and-enter on a church.
He'd done time for the offence but had not surrendered
the goods in question. I guess he felt he'd paid for them
with his jail time.


He saw me gaping and came over, smiling toothily,
one hand stretched out, palm downwards.


"Hello, I'm Father Francis, the house chaplain.
Would you care to join us? The service is just starting."


An unctuous voice from one barely in his twenties. I

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I left and ducked into the bathroom, whose adjoining
wall made eavesdropping easy. I grinned at his pious
Latin, probably learned phonetically, and his equally
pious, though not unpleasant, singing.


An insistent knock at the door cut short my run, so I
continued down to Gary's room, wondering why Alice
was letting herself be fooled by that character. Miss
Pattison was stuck beyond redemption on the Father.
Bertha, her self-effacing roommate, would go along
simply in order not to offend anyone. But crusty old
Alice was nobody's fool. (Later, it became obvious why
Alice attended every service she could. It seemed that
"the Blood of the Lamb" was poured out very generously
several times during the Phoney Father's performance
— an immediate blessing of warmth and foggy
delight.)


Gary was grouching and grumbling in his room; he'd
been sick for the last few days, a touch of flu complicating
his ever-present bronchitis. He was flat on his back,
hardly able to make it to the bathroom. He had his filthy
blanket tucked up to his chin. I touched his forehead
and it was burning. He growled about not being able to
get any sleep with all the half-wits banging up and
down the stairs outside his room. I searched the

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I scrubbed and sterilized the thermometer as best I
could, not wanting to add to his problems with
whatever microbes had been incubating on it for God
knows how long. Against his protests, I popped it into
his mouth.


"Gimme a cigarette first," he hollered, and it fell from
his mouth to the blanket.


"Later," I promised, firmly reinserting it.


Antony Thompson wandered in and sat on Andy's
empty, unmade bed. Nobody paid any real attention to
Antony; he was the undisputed nuisance of the house.
His head, as if it were too heavy for his neck, was pulled
down almost to his right shoulder, enhancing his already
strange appearance. He seemed, at the moment, resentful
of the attention Gary was getting.


"I took my temperature this morning. I knew I was
sick, and I was right. 114 degrees!" His lips crawled over
his gums as he spoke. I had no patience for him.


"So," I said, slapping Gary's hands away from the
thermometer, "how does it feel to be dead?"


"What, will it kill me?" He hyperventilated.


"Well, Antony, you sure as hell wouldn't be sitting
here talking to us, not to mention thermometers don't
even go that high."


"I have a special one," he countered, resentfully.


"Even so. It's not possible."

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He stood up, outraged, his mouth working, his hands
shaking, his head almost straightening in his self-righteousness.


"Don't tell me what's possible! I was a male nurse for
twenty years, I worked every ward, I went to university.
Don't tell me I don't have 114 degrees...," he
blustered.


The week before, he'd claimed to have spent his life
as a chef in some of the world's best restaurants. He'd
convinced Jack, who must have been drunk, to let him
prepare a Chinese meal for everyone's supper. He'd fried
and served the rice without ever bringing it near water.


"Antony, I think you and your killer temperature better
go off to bed. Gary doesn't need all this noise."


"Right, bugger off, before I jump up and bitecha!"
hollered Gary, popping the thermometer in and out
before I could grab him. Antony sidled out, cursing us
for being ignorant assholes who wouldn't know a
temperature if it killed us.


Gary was, in comparison to Antony, a mild 102
degrees. I lit the promised cigarette, watching nervously
as every drag bent him into violent spasms.


"Gary, can you sit up?"


"I got no clothes on." He blushed.


"I've seen naked men once or twice in my life, Gary.
Nothing you got's gonna come as any surprise. Besides,
I want to rub some alcohol on your back and shoulders,
and I can't see you lying on that!" I poked the protrusion
his belly made under the blanket.


He laughed. "Don't say I didn't warn you!" He

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In deference to his modesty, I helped him tuck the
sheet around what he could. I warmed the alcohol in
my palms before spreading it on his broad back. He
yelped at first, then gave out little moans of pleasure as I
massaged him. He then lay back, eyes closed, and let me
do his chest. When I'd finished and tucked him back
under his blanket, he asked me for another smoke. I
checked my pockets and then the bed, unable to find
my cigarettes. It took me a few seconds to notice that
the frame and mattress were vibrating, and that Gary
was a bright red, his chest and belly shaking soundlessly.
I played along, and said quite sternly, "Okay, you turkey,
hand them over!"


All the giggles he'd been holding back escaped from
his mouth, and he held the pack up high in triumph.


I nursed him off and on for days, I suspect at least one
or two longer than necessary. He kept hiding my
smokes and I kept retrieving them, loving to hear his
childlike laughter. He gloried in being taken care of,
and I gloried in being able to do something real for
someone in this house. Maybe, even in my excruciating,
self-absorbed poverty, I could still find something to
give, something to show I wasn't as useless as the world
had labelled me.

I had been troubled in my last year of college
by my impending graduation and the void that
promised to follow. Although I'd been accepted into
Sir George Williams University, I knew it would be a
very different experience than my three years at Dawson
College (the first English CEGEP in Montreal). I had
achieved a fair amount of success there — in grades,
socially and as a student leader. I was a student rep in the
English department for three years and was twice elected
to the school's Academic Council. I'd been published
in collections of poetry. I'd even, after completing
my own acid experiences, run a drug crisis line one
summer at the school. Caricatures of half a dozen school
leaders, including myself, hung for a time in the school's
board room, and I'd become used to the status of "big
fish in a small pond."


Towards the beginning of my last semester, I met a
young boy from Weredale, an institution for delinquent
and troubled teens, when he tried to bum a cigarette
from me on Dorchester Boulevard. In subsequent days
and weeks, he introduced me to some of his friends, and
in a short time I had an entourage of streetwise, punky-looking
kids following me to school and home. I convinced
the college administration, who were only too
happy to assist me in involving myself in activities not
related to school politics, to donate a few rooms for use
as a clubhouse. The boys, now a dozen or so, chose to
create an electronics room to work on their transistors
and stereos, a newspaper room for the newsletter we

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048395-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Almost exactly the same time as I graduated from
Dawson, I married a young man with whom I'd lived
for approximately six months. I'd met him through my
work at Weredale; he was one of a number of staff who
quietly assisted my efforts to make life a little easier for
the kids.


He was a nice enough guy, but I knew it was a mistake,
even as I walked down the aisle. In the back of my
head, I was prepared to commit for a year or two, but
even that seemed like an awfully long time to be with
any one person. Although I liked to believe then that I
had a great deal of insight into the kinds of things that
motivated me, I overlooked the common societal pressure
on any single female, and my intense dislike of the
term "old maid." It's my belief now that I got married
just to be able to say that, damnit, I had been married.


After completing one year at Sir George, achieving
academic honours, I applied for and got a job at a group-home
agency that only hired couples. The marriage
enabled me to work at the group home, and the group
home returned the favour by keeping the marriage going
four years longer than it would have otherwise.

The kids, seven of them, ranging in age from thirteen
to eighteen, taught a lot to their twenty-three-year-old
group-home mother. They taught me that to show caring
in large and small ways went a great distance to
winning back horribly damaged children. I understood
that damage: I remembered too well what I'd wished for
and had never received. Reading stories to kids before
bed, helping them with their homework, holding them
when they cried, disciplining them when they screwed
up, always loving and showing that love, went a long
way towards healing me.


The very worst thing about the last useless year of my
life, just before coming to the boarding house, was hearing
all the mental health professionals telling me that I
could no longer do that kind of work. I had to accept
that it was too stressful, they said; I should submit myself
to vocational rehabilitation. Something like furniture
reupholstering was suggested. It was another nail in the
coffin: more evidence that I was crazier than I thought,
more evidence that I would never be able to reach out
to another troubled person, another troubled life.
