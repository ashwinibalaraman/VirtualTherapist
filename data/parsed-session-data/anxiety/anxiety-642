I know I need to be with her, and she with me, but I can't shake the
depression. She seems happy and can't see the ever-growing fear I
have that I can't live out the rest of my life without her in my corner;
and yet I am amazingly annoyed at the same time that I can no
longer dream about and pursue the wrong women.


She sits there with a smile just like I used to have after bringing a
beautiful, polished apple to one of the few attractive grade-school
teachers I had, who somewhere down deep, I felt, maybe wished I
was a grown man so we could be married.


Maybe that's it. I finally want to be a man to one woman forever
and I don't know how. Dare I tell her any of this? She might just
stare at me. She might even feign some sudden female problem and
split, sighing with relief as she drives away from my home. Slowly
but surely she'll turn up her car radio, she'll sing louder and louder
to drown out her second of sorrow over losing me, yet at the same
time be kind of happy about gaining her freedom from my self-imposed
exile in sharing my trust.


I sort of feel like I do everyone a favor when I drive them away. I
never factor myself into the equation because, to be frank, I think
I'm sort of happy to be "un-bugged." I get on my own case constantly
and get over it, but when someone who claims to love me
gets in my way, I see no way out, except perhaps to disappear.


I have always felt trapped by women. I mean, perhaps it would
have been better if I had somehow spent the nine months getting
ready for my birth outside the womb, like some lobster tail that a
waiter made sure was served out of the shell. Sure, it would have
been weird for my mother, but I might have felt less controlled as I
grew up, in some sort of mysterious, psychoanalytical, bullshit way.


Recently, a woman who professed to love me told me in no uncertain
terms, "I think I want to spend the rest of my life with you."


I freaked. As is usually the case when I hear this type of sentiment,

"This has nothing to do with you," she exclaimed, trying to calm
me down.


How funny is that? Of course it has to do with me. (When I
became an alcoholic and I'm not certain exactly when the disease
took over, <i>everything</i> had to do with me.) Now I'm a little more
serene and have much more <i>acceptance in my life</i>. I might even be a
little spiritual. Yikes! Hard to believe that, as cynical as I am, I can
believe in some sort of higher power. But I do. And yet, when true
romance enters the scene I become a self-doubting, blithering
idiot, full of fear and paranoia, while my faith in God and myself
leaves me.


I became a comedian because I had a sort of faith in myself that I
knew when a joke was right. I never practiced guitar because Hendrix
was the God and I insanely felt I had to play up to that standard.
I never studied painting because I felt I would never know when to
finish a canvas. I never settled down because I never felt settled.


So what if she is sitting upstairs? She can't sit there forever. I
mean, the housekeeper will move her eventually, right? Aah, shit!
I'm fucked! I just don't know whether I still feel like I'm not worthy
of happiness, or if a woman who claims she loves me is inevitably
lying, or whether I'm just (like many women contend) a typical guy
who loves women but can't grow up. On top of that, I'm also crippled
with the fear that as soon as I say, "I do," my new bride will collapse
with a new and exotic disease that will keep her bedridden from then
on and my secret life with other women will slowly drive me mad
and get me institutionalized. And while there I'll think, somewhere
down deep, that it's where I have always belonged anyway.


Nah, I really don't sound like the marrying kind. More like <i>The
Fugitive Kind</i>.


I'm like some middle-aged Jewish sociopath when it comes to
intimacy, living out an experimental lifelong play that Tennessee
Williams (if alive) would keep faxing me daily, to act out and keep
myself unhappy.

Maybe that's why so many of those Chagall paintings always
made me feel hopeful. The way those grooms would hold on to their
beloved wives and levitate with joy. What a great notion.


Don't knock it till you've tried it.


She's sitting upstairs. Maybe she's my soul mate.


Uh-oh. "Checkmate."
