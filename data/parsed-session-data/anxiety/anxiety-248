There is a wealth of historical, crosscultural,
and anecdotal evidence that
the temptation to become involved in a
sexual relationship outside one's marriage is a
widespread phenomenon and that extradyadic
sexual relationships have surfaced wherever
marriages have existed. Nevertheless, as illustrated
by terms such as <i>adultery, cheating, infidelity</i>,
and <i>unfaithfulness</i>, extramarital sexual
involvement generally is considered a serious
betrayal of one's spouse. Indeed, infidelity by
one's partner, and even the thought that such
infidelity <i>might</i> occur, can evoke intense and
aggressive jealousy among many individuals.
Even more, jealousy seems to have been acknowledged
as one of the most prevalent and
potentially destructive experiences in love relationships.
In this chapter, we focus on the
tension between the apparently strong appeal
of extradyadic sexual relationships and the
equally strong negative response that such relationships
usually evoke in one's partner. We
discuss the societal context of extradyadic
sexual relationships and jealousy, various theoretical
perspectives on these phenomena, the
factors associated with extradyadic sexual involvement,
the effects of such involvement on
the primary relationship, the determinants of
jealousy, and therapeutic interventions for
dealing with jealousy and extradyadic sex. Although
our main focus is on extradyadic sex
and jealousy in the context of marital relationships,
we also pay attention to these phenomena
in the context of other primary relationships
including dating, cohabiting, and gay
and lesbian relationships.


- <b>Societal Context</b>


<b><i>Incidence of Extradyadic Sex</i></b>


Throughout history and in contemporary
society, reports on the incidence of illegitimate
children sired by men with women other
than their wives testify to the consistent

[p. <i>318</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00340&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>General Norms With Respect
to Extradyadic Sex</i></b>


Despite the occurrence of extradyadic sex
all over the world, there seems to exist a universal
concern with the moral regulation of
extradyadic sexual relationships and with specifying
the conditions under which such
behavior is and is not allowed (Ford &amp; Beach,
1951). Even today, extramarital sex is a crime
according to the laws of many American
states, although these laws seldom are enforced.
Although attitudes in some countries
became somewhat more relaxed during the
"sexual revolution" of the 1970s, a majority of
respondents in most Western countries consistently
disapprove of extramarital relationships
under all circumstances (Glenn &amp; Weaver,
1979; Lawson &amp; Samson, 1988). Moreover,
whereas a few decades ago a negative attitude
toward extradyadic sex was more prominent
in the United States than in Western European
countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Belgium,
and the Netherlands, this gap seems to
be narrowing. For example, in the Netherlands,
the percentage of the adult population
that considered extramarital sex to be wrong
increased from only 43% in 1970 to 78% in
1997 (Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, 1998).
Even extradyadic involvements that merely
have the potential to evolve into sexual relationships
(e.g., having dinner in a secluded
place, dancing) are disapproved of by a majority
of individuals in present society (Weis
&amp; Felton, 1987). Nevertheless, compared to
marital relationships, attitudes toward infidelity
are less negative in committed dating relationships
and gay relationships, although this
is not the case in lesbian relationships (Bailey,
Gaulin, Agyei, &amp; Gladue, 1994; Bringle, 1995;
Sheppard, Nelson, &amp; Andreoli-Mathie, 1995).
Moreover, attitudes are less negative among
younger individuals, the better educated and
those from the upper middle class, individuals
who are less religious, those living in urban
areas, and those holding liberal political orientations
(for a review, see Buunk &amp; Van
Driel, 1989).


<b><i>The Double Standard</i></b>


Despite the general disapproval of extradyadic
sex all over the world, during all periods
of history, a <i>double standard</i> has been

- <b>Theoretical Perspectives</b>


There have been many theoretical perspectives
from which jealousy and extradyadic
sexual relationships have been analyzed including
diverse approaches such as psychoanalysis
(Jones, 1930), field theory (Lewin,
1951), script theory (Atwater, 1982), humanistic
psychology (Constantine, 1976), and the
self-evaluation maintenance model (Salovey
&amp; Rodin, 1986). Here, we briefly mention
three theories that we think are particularly
relevant for understanding the conditions under
which both jealousy and extradyadic sex
can occur: attachment theory, social exchange
and interdependence theory, and evolutionary
psychology. These theories all have
a firm basis in fundamental research and, in
our view, in recent years have become the
best developed, most extensive, and most
fruitful perspectives for studying close relationships.
The three theories represent different
levels of explanation. Evolutionary theory
tries to explain the <i>ultimate</i> motives for engaging
in extradyadic sex and behaving jealously,
that is, how such behaviors might have
contributed to reproductive success in our
evolutionary past. Attachment theory is basically
a developmental theory of <i>individual
differences</i> and tries to explain why some individuals,
due to their childhood histories, are
more inclined to become jealous and
possessive or to experience problems with
building committed and sexually exclusive
relationships. Social exchange and interdependence
theory is aimed at explaining
jealousy and extradyadic sex as related to
processes of reciprocity and dependency in
the <i>relationship</i>.


<b><i>Attachment Theory</i></b>


According to attachment theory, due to differences
in caregivers' responsiveness to children's
needs, a majority of individuals will develop
a secure attachment style, characterized
by feeling comfortable with intimacy and by
trusting others. However, a substantial number
will develop an insecure attachment style,
either avoiding intimacy and commitment or
becoming overly dependent and "clinging" to
their partners (see Chapter 14 by Feeney,
Noller, &amp; Roberts, this volume). Although
originally proposed to explain interactions between
children and parents, attachment theory
has been fruitfully applied to adult intimate
relationships as well (Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1987;
Miller &amp; Fishkin, 1997). Attachment theory
would predict that securely attached individuals
will favor long-term committed relationships
characterized by fidelity and trust,
whereas individuals with an insecure attachment
style will have less stable relationships
and will more likely engage in extradyadic affairs.
Because it is assumed that the attachment
system regulates emotions and behaviors

[p. <i>320</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00342&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Social Exchange and Interdependence
Theory</i></b>


Exchange and interdependency theory assumes
that individuals form and continue relationships
on the basis of reciprocity in costs
and rewards in these relationships (Burgess &amp;
Huston, 1979; Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959). Individuals
not only will experience distress (especially
in the form of frustration and anger)
in situations where the others are indebted to
them, but they also will be upset in situations
where they are indebted to the others because
of feelings of obligation, fear of being unable
to repay the debts, and uncertainty about if,
when, and how the debts could be repaid
(Walster, Walster, &amp; Berscheid, 1978). Therefore,
relationships are more satisfying and stable
when the outcomes for each partner (rewards
and costs) are more or less equal.
However, in the course of the relationship,
partners become <i>dependent</i> on each other.
They develop the ability to control and influence
each other's outcomes, the outcomes of
both partners become intertwined, and positive
experiences of the one might vicariously
become rewards for the other (e.g., "I am
happy because he [she] is happy"). According
to Rusbult (1983; see also Rusbult &amp; Buunk,
1993), commitment is the subjective representation
of dependency, based on high satisfaction,
irretrievable investments, and low-quality
alternatives. Commitment consists of a
feeling of psychological attachment to the
partner accompanied by the desire to maintain
the relationship. One would expect that, in
general, reciprocity concerns can play a role
when individuals contemplate engaging in
extradyadic sex and when individuals are confronted
with infidelity of their partners. For
example, the lower level of jealousy in gay relationships,
as compared to heterosexual relationships,
might be due to the fact that gays
(but not lesbians) engage more in extradyadic
sex themselves and, therefore, consider it fair
to allow their partners to do the same. Moreover,
a high level of dependency and commitment
will be accompanied by a stronger desire
to preserve the quality and stability of one's
current relationship and, therefore, by both a
higher level of jealousy and a lower inclination
to become involved in extradyadic sex.


<b><i>Evolutionary Psychology</i></b>


This perspective is largely based on neo-Darwinist
theories in evolutionary biology
and assumes that present-day humans are
characterized by a complex set of mental
mechanisms that have evolved because such
mechanisms fostered reproductive success
during ancestral times. Given the importance
of the pair bond for reproductive success
among humans (compared to other higher primates),
a universal concern with the potential
threat of extradyadic sexual relationships to
this bond is easy to explain. Nevertheless, for
females, investing in a long-term relationship
is virtually an absolute necessity to produce
offspring who survive to reproduce, whereas
for men, the option exists to invest minimally
—only one act of sexual intercourse at
the theoretical low end. As a consequence,
men would have evolved a stronger tendency
than women to be open to casual extradyadic
sex ("short-term mating"), more or less independent
of the states of their marital relationships,
and men can afford to be less selective
than women in choosing partners for such casual
encounters (Buss, 1994; Symons, 1979).
Nevertheless, evolutionary psychologists recently
have suggested that extradyadic sex
might have had considerable reproductive
benefits for females as well. First, women
might have intercourse with various men to
create confusion over who are the fathers of
their offspring and, thereby, elicit the investment
of resources from multiple males. Second,
as has been observed among birds, in
choosing long-term mates, women have to

- <b>Psychological Correlates of
Extradyadic Sexual Involvement</b>


Some therapists have suggested that involvement
in extramarital affairs often stems from
psychological problems such as the seeking
of narcissistic joy, a sense of insecurity, a low
frustration tolerance, a fear of commitment,
and immaturity (cf. Glass &amp; Wright, 1992;
Pietropinto &amp; Simenauer, 1977). Although
such claims seem quite overstated, there is
some evidence that individuals who engage in
extradyadic sex often are characterized by
lower levels of mental health. For example,
dating infidelity is related to lower self-esteem
(Sheppard, Nelson &amp; Andreoli-Mathie,
1995); participants in sexually open marriages
have been in marital therapy relatively
often (Watson, 1981); women with histrionic
personality disorders (i.e., characterized by
helplessness and dependency, sensitivity to
criticism, identity disturbances, marked
mood swings, and impulsivity) are relatively
more likely to enter into affairs (Apt &amp;
Hurlbert, 1994); and women low in conscientiousness,
high in narcissism, and high in
psychoticism seem particularly inclined to
commit various acts of infidelity (Buss &amp;
Shackelford, 1997). Although little research
has directly examined the association between
attachment styles and extradyadic sexual
involvement, Hazan and Shaver (1994)
did find that anxious-ambivalently attached
individuals more often engaged in one-night
stands, and Miller and Fishkin (1997) found
that avoidant-anxiously attached men (but not
women) sought many more partners over a
30-year period than did securely attached
men. Finally, Seal, Agostinelli, and Hannet
(1994) found that the willingness to engage in
extradyadic sex was related to sociosexuality,
a concept developed by Simpson and
Gangestead (1991) referring to the willingness
to engage in casual, uncommitted sexual
relations.


Committing adultery is related not only to
personality characteristics but also to <i>relationship
characteristics</i>. It is a widely held assumption
among both clinicians and laypeople
that adultery stems primarily from
problems in the primary relationship (Glass &amp;
Wright, 1992; Taylor, 1986). Indeed, in general,
dissatisfaction with the quality of marriage
is, particularly among women, associated
with a positive attitude toward extramarital
sex, with fantasizing about it, and with actually

[p. <i>322</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00344&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition, there is evidence that, as interdependence
theory would predict, extradyadic
sex might be particularly likely to occur in relationships
characterized by low dependency
and low commitment. Buunk (1980a) found
that those who had been engaged in
extradyadic sex and were inclined to do so in
the future were lower in emotional dependency,
that is, a feeling of emotional attachment
to their partners accompanied by the
perception that their relationships surpass
what one could expect in other relationships.
Johnson and Rusbult (1989) found that those
with low commitment were more open to contact
with attractive members of the opposite
sex, whereas those high in commitment
tended to derogate attractive potential partners.
A study by Buunk and Bakker (1995a)
showed that commitment to a steady partner
was a major important determinant of the intention
to engage in extradyadic sexual relationships,
and in line with interdependence
theory (Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993), it was
mainly through their effect on commitment
that a lack of satisfaction, attractive alternatives,
and low investments in their relationships
contributed to the intention to have
extradyadic sexual intentions.


In addition to the personal and relational
characteristics discussed thus far, the <i>social
context</i> often will play an important role in
fostering extradyadic sexual involvement. For
example, opposite-sex friendships can constitute
a powerful opportunity for sexual affairs.
Atwater (1982) found that, among many
women, extramarital affairs evolved gradually
in the process of developing intimate friendships.
This is consistent with the finding by
Wiggins and Lederer (1984) that those who
had affairs with co-workers had happier marriages
than did those who had affairs with others
such as neighbors and strangers. Furthermore,
the chances of extradyadic sexual
involvement might be enhanced in a social environment
with relatively favorable norms regarding
extradyadic sex. For example, Buunk
and Bakker (1995b) demonstrated that, in addition

[p. <i>323</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00345&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

- <b>Involvement in
Extradyadic Affairs</b>


Individuals involved in extradyadic relationships
often find themselves in situations
where strong problems generated by these relationships
conflict with the strong attraction
to the extradyadic partners. Extradyadic relationships
often have a very high reward potential
and can at least temporarily surpass
the primary relationships in terms of sexual
excitement, personal growth, self-discovery,
and communication. However, such positive
aspects often are overshadowed by practical
and emotional problems accompanied with
the maintenance of a secret affair including
the requirement that one has to have a private
place to meet; that one has to be careful in
telephoning, writing, and seeing the extramarital
partner; that one has to cope with
feelings of conflict, anxiety, and guilt; that
one has to face the risk of jeopardizing the
primary relationship; and that one has to deal
with the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted
disease such as AIDS (Atwater, 1982;
Buunk, 1980b; Choi, Catania, &amp; Dolcini,
1994). In line with the double standard,
Spanier and Margolis (1983) found that guilt
was experienced more by females (59%) than
by males (34%). An additional problem faced
by individuals engaged in extradyadic affairs
might be the unequal involvement that can
occur in these affairs, for example, when only
one of the partners wants to give up his or
her primary relationship and particularly
when the extradyadic partner does not have a
primary relationship (e.g., an affair between a
married man and a single woman) (Richardson,
1985). Remarkably, little is known about
the stability of extradyadic relationships. In a
study among 59 women who had had sexual
affairs outside their marriages without their
spouses being aware of them, Hurlbert (1992)
found that affairs had lasted longer when they
were characterized by a higher degree of love,
when the partners had known each other longer
before the affairs began, and (in the case
of predominantly sexual affairs) when they
had more positive attitudes toward sex.


- <b>Effects of Extradyadic Sex
On the Primary Relationship</b>


Extradyadic sexual relationships often will
constitute a serious threat to the primary relationships.
Even when the adulterous individuals
have no intent to end the primary relationships,
the primary relationships might in
various ways look bleak compared to the romance
and sexual excitement experienced in
the extradyadic relationships. Nevertheless,
many of those involved in extradyadic sexual
relationships claim that such relationships did
not have adverse effects, or even that they had
positive effects, on the primary relationships
(Hunt, 1974). Of course, such claims might
be rationalizations of one's adulterous behavior.
In this context, it is noteworthy that individuals
tend to assume that the effects of their
own extradyadic affairs are relatively benign
but that affairs of their partners are more
harmful to their relationships. For example,
in a study by Hansen (1987), about 40% of
the men respondents felt that their own
extradyadic relationships had hurt their primary
relationships, whereas more than 70%
felt that this was true of extradyadic relationships
of their partners. In an interesting approach,
Charny and Parnass (1995) asked
practicing therapists to describe in depth specific
extramarital affairs with which they
were familiar. According to these therapists,
in more than half of the cases, a one-time
extramarital relationship had a negative impact

[p. <i>324</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00346&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

- <b>Jealousy as a Response to
Actual or Imagined Extradyadic
Sex of One's Partner</b>


Most extradyadic relationships are kept secret
from the primary partners, and even when
these cuckolded partners get obvious clues
that the other partners might be having affairs,
such clues often are denied because the
offended partners might not <i>want</i> to know
they are being cheated on. According to the
therapists studied by Charny and Parnass
(1995), nearly half of the cuckolded spouses
did not consciously acknowledge their
spouses' extramarital behavior, although
there were indications that they really knew
about the affairs. Remarkably, fully 58% of
the betrayed spouses were seen as expressing
explicit or tacit acceptance of their partners'
affairs. On the other hand, some individuals
are extremely jealous about and hypersensitive
to every cue that their partners might be
unfaithful, for example, changes in normal
routine and sexual behavior, exaggerated displays
of affection, and the reluctance to discuss
a certain other person (Shackelford &amp;
Buss, 1997). Whereas it often is associated
with suspiciousness about and oversensitivity
to the partner's interest in others, jealousy can
be seen as a multidimensional concept
(Buunk, 1997; Pfeiffer &amp; Wong, 1989), and at
least three different types of jealousy can be
distinguished. First, jealousy may be defined
as a negative emotional response to involvement
of one's partner in relationships with
others. This type of jealousy is labeled <i>reactive</i>
jealousy (Buunk, 1997) and also is called
<i>emotional</i> or <i>provoked</i> jealousy (Hoaken,
1976; Pfeiffer &amp; Wong, 1989). Second, jealousy
may have a more inner directed nature
and take the form of <i>anxious</i> jealousy
(Buunk, 1997), which also is labeled as <i>cognitive</i>
or <i>neurotic</i> jealousy by other authors
(Guerrero, Eloy, Jorgensen, &amp; Andersen,
1993; Mathes, Roter, &amp; Joerger, 1981; Pfeiffer
&amp; Wong, 1989). In this type of jealousy,
the individual cognitively generates images
of the partner becoming actively involved
with someone else, which results in more or
less obsessive anxiety, upset, suspiciousness,
and worrying. Third, jealousy may have the
function of preventing a partner from becoming
sexually unfaithful. This type of jealousy,
therefore, is called <i>preventive</i> jealousy
(Buunk, 1997), which also is labeled as <i>suspicious,
behavioral</i>, or <i>unprovoked</i> jealousy by
other authors (Bringle, 1991; Hoaken, 1976;
Pfeiffer &amp; Wong, 1989). In this type of jealousy,
an individual is overly reactive to even
slight indications of interest by the partner in
a third person and might go to considerable
lengths to prevent intimate contact of the
partner with a third party.


Whereas their partners' actual or imagined
infidelity will be experienced as a threat by
both men and women, according to evolutionary

[p. <i>325</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00347&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An additional situational factor influencing
the degree of jealousy is <i>rival characteristics</i>.
In line with an evolutionary-psychological
perspective, it has been found that jealousy is
evoked particularly by those characteristics
that contribute most to the rival's value as a
partner, with women reporting more jealousy
than men when the rivals were physically attractive
and men reporting more jealousy than
women when the rivals possessed status-related
characteristics (Buss, Shackelford,
Choe, &amp; Buunk, in press; Dijkstra &amp; Buunk,
1998; Hupka &amp; Eshett, 1988). In general, individuals
become particularly jealous when
the rivals are seen to possess characteristics
that their partners might find important and,
therefore, will derogate the rivals most on
those dimensions that they perceive to be important
to their partners (Schmitt. 1988).
Moreover, rivals who surpass individuals on
dimensions that are important to the individuals'
self-esteem have been found to be the
most threatening (DeSteno &amp; Salovey, 1996).
Finally, the level of acquaintance with a rival
appears to play a role. For example, Pines and
Aronson (1983) found that, particularly for
men, the least jealousy-evoking rivals were
those whom participants did not know personally,
whereas the most jealousy-evoking rivals
were those whom participants knew personally,
in particular those of whom they were envious
(see also Hupka &amp; Eshett, 1988).


- <b>Psychological Correlates
of Jealousy</b>


Jealousy has long been linked to <i>personality
characteristics</i> such as insecurity and low
self-esteem (Mead, 1977; Sullivan, 1953). In
general, it is assumed that individuals with
low self-esteem will feel more threatened
when their partners are attracted to others
and, therefore, will experience more jealousy.
There is considerable support for this assumption,
especially among women (Buunk,
1997; Hansen, 1987; Peretti &amp; Pudowski,
1997), and variables directly related to self-esteem,
such as feelings of personal inadequacy

[p. <i>326</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00348&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Attachment theory suggests that individuals
with disrupted attachment histories are
more likely to interpret the behavior of their
spouses in terms of abandonment and, therefore,
will have a lower threshold for adult jealousy.
Indeed, individuals with an insecure attachment
style have been found to be more
jealous than individuals with a secure attachment
style (Radecki-Bush, Farrell, &amp; Bush,
1993). Buunk (1997) found that anxious-ambivalent
participants were the most jealous,
followed by avoidant participants, with securely
attached individuals experiencing the
least jealousy. That individuals with an anxious-ambivalent
attachment style are particularly
jealous given their overly dependent attitudes
seems easy to understand, but why
would an avoidant style be accompanied by
jealousy? It might be that those with an
avoidant style actually <i>are</i> quite dependent on
their partners but feel that they are not meeting
the needs of their partners by their distant
attitudes and, therefore, are concerned about
losing their partners. Although attachment
styles are related to personality characteristics
such as self-esteem, neuroticism, and social
anxiety that are associated with jealousy,
Buunk found that the effect of attachment
style on jealousy was independent of such
personality variables. In addition, there is evidence
that attachment styles affect the behaviors
individuals exhibit in response to suspected
or actual infidelity. Individuals with an
avoidant attachment style use relatively fewer
relationship-maintaining behaviors such as
talking about the problem and coming to an
understanding, are especially likely to direct
their anger and blame against the rivals, and
are less likely to seek social support. Individuals
with a preoccupied or anxious-ambivalent
attachment style, on the other hand, are
more likely to use surveillance behavior (e.g.,
looking through their partners' belongings), to
blame themselves, and to resist expressing anger
(presumably out of fear of rejection). By
contrast, securely attached individuals, in response
to their partners' infidelity, express anger
toward the partners and, in general, adopt
more productive coping strategies aimed at
maintaining their relationships (Guerrero,
1998; Radecki-Bush et al., 1993; Sharpsteen
&amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997).


One of the reasons why jealousy is particularly
characteristic of individuals with low
self-esteem, a high level of neuroticism, and
an insecure attachment style might be that
such individuals become very involved in
their relationships. Indeed, Radecki-Bush,
Bush, and Jennings (1988) found that low
self-esteem fosters dependency ìn relationships,
and most research examining the associated
<i>relationship characteristics</i> has focused
in some way on the degree to which
individuals feel dependent on their partners.
Social exchange and interdependency theory
would predict that, because someone who is
more dependent has more to lose, jealousy
will be more frequent and intense among
those highly dependent on their relationships.
In line with this prediction, jealousy has been
found to be more strongly related to loving
than to liking (Mathes &amp; Severa, 1981; Pfeiffer
&amp; Wong, 1989; White, 1984), to be associated
with emotional dependency (Buunk,
1995), and to be less common among those
who maintained separate identities (including
having their own activities that did not include

Although, in line with social exchange theory,
Buunk (1995), Buunk and Bakker (1997),
and Bringle and Boebinger (1990) found that
individuals who are inclined to engage in
extradyadic sexual and erotic behaviors are
more likely to indicate that they will tolerate
such behaviors from their partners, other studies
indicate that the opposite might occur and
that individuals might project their own adulterous
urges onto their partners. For example,
Pines and Aronson (1983) found that, in general,
individuals who had had real or fantasized
sexual involvement with others felt
more jealous of threats of their partners' infidelity.
Francis (1977) found men and women
to differ; whereas jealous women were less
likely to be involved with third parties, jealous
men were <i>more</i> likely to be involved in
extradyadic relationships, suggesting that
men project their unfaithful urges onto their
partners. Furthermore, women in particular
seem to become less jealous the more
extradyadic sexual affairs their husbands have
had, whereas among men, jealousy seems unaffected
by the number of affairs their wives
have had (Buunk, 1995). From an evolutionary
perspective, this result is easy to understand.
For men, <i>any</i> act of intercourse with a
third person is a potential threat, whereas for
women, the fact that their partners have been
unfaithful a number of times while maintaining
their commitment might lead women, under
some conditions, to adapt to their partners'
infidelity.


- <b>Coping With Jealousy</b>


Eventually accepting their partners' infidelity
might be the result of a process of <i>coping</i>
with jealousy through which individuals reappraise
the threat. Several authors (e.g.,
Mathes, 1991; Sharpsteen, 1991; White,
1981) have used Lazarus's model of coping
(Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) to describe how
individuals deal with jealous feelings. After
the primary appraisal, during which the degree
of threat to the relationships is assessed,
during secondary appraisal, individuals evaluate
the availability of coping strategies that
might reduce the threat. Coping strategics are
not limited to deliberate conscious attempts
to modify the threat but also might consist of
unconscious instinctive reactions to a jealousy
event such as spontaneously expressing
anger. Through such strategies, individuals
might not only let off steam but also warn rivals
to stay away and alert partners to be more
cautious and take the individuals' feelings
into account. Many ways of coping with jealousy
have been identified, and several attempts
have been made to summarize these
by the use of factorial analysis into broader
categories including avoidance of the spouse,
reappraisal of the situation, and communication
with the partner (Buunk, 1982;
Constantine, 1976; Hansen, 1987).


Men and women seem to differ in the ways
in which they cope with jealousy situations. A
recurrent finding is that, in response to a jealousy-evoking
event, women in particular have
the tendency to think that they are "not good
enough," to doubt themselves more than do
men (Buunk, 1995), and to try making themselves
look more attractive (Buss &amp;
Shackelford, 1997; Mullen &amp; Martin, 1994).
In addition, men more often report that they
would get drunk or high when confronted
with their partners' infidelity (DeWeerth &amp;
Kalma, 1993). Moreover, research consistently
has shown that women are more inclined
than men to endorse aggressive action
against the rivals (DeWeerth &amp; Kalma, 1993;
Paul, Foss, &amp; Galloway, 1993). This finding

- <b>Therapeutic Interventions
Aimed at Jealousy and
Extradyadic Affairs</b>


Therapists and counselors often are confronted
with relationships in which infidelity
is a serious issue. For example, one study
showed that in 26% of marriage counseling
cases, extramarital sex is considered one of
the major problems (Sprenkle &amp; Weis, 1978).
If extramarital sex is one of the problems with
which a couple is dealing, then the therapist
usually sees each partner individually, after
which joint sessions begin. During these individual
sessions, the therapist sometimes is
confronted with the secret infidelity of one of
the partners without being able to share this
information with the other partner because of
confidentiality. A therapist, in general, does
not like to be placed in this position and,
therefore, usually asks the unfaithful partner
to break off all extramarital contacts. In the
joint sessions, the couple will explore the
meaning of the extramarital affair to the partners'
relationship—the motives for engaging
in the extramarital affair, the degree of commitment
to the extramarital affair, and the degree
of actual or desired commitment to the
marriage. When the extramarital affair is out
in the open, the therapist also must deal with
the victimized partner's injured self-esteem
and feelings of jealousy, anger, and hurt. In so
doing, both partners are asked to take responsibility
for their contributions to the affair and
to stop blaming each other. A partner's infidelity
may be redefined, for example, by
viewing the affair as an attempt to regain
emotional contact with the partner, and the
victimized partner then can take part of the
responsibility for the lack of emotional contact
in the marriage. Finally, individuals have
to make a decision about the future course of
their marriage, and when they agree on extramarital
sex as a supplement to their marriage,
therapy will focus in particular on the balance
between the desire for sexual variety and the
commitment to the "central" relationship
(see, e.g., Elbaum, 1981; Sprenkle &amp; Weis,
1978).


Although treatment of jealousy often occurs
in the context of global relationship improvement
or in the counseling after extramarital
sex, jealousy of one of the partners
also might be the focus of couple therapy in
the absence of a partner's infidelity such as in
the case of morbid or pathological jealousy.
Whereas during the beginning and middle of
the 20th century jealousy was primarily
treated by psychoanalysts who viewed jealousy
as a defense against homosexual tendencies
or as a projection of one's own desire to
be unfaithful, during the past two decades,
therapists have mostly relied on counseling
that includes behavioral and cognitive components
and that emphasizes communication between
the partners. Therapies that include one
or more of these components are behavioral
systems therapy (Margolin, 1981), cognitive
therapy (Dolan &amp; Bishay, 1996), and rational
emotive behavior therapy (Ellis, 1996).


In general, both partners enter into therapy
and work through the jealousy problem by the
use of homework assignments. The <i>behavioral</i>
component of therapy assumes that the
jealous behavior is repeated because it is reinforced
by the perceived loss of a partner or
one's self-esteem. The aim of therapy, therefore,
is to disrupt this cycle that leads to (often
unreasonable) jealousy with behavioral techniques
such as fixed role-playing (e.g., play

[p. <i>329</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00351&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The <i>cognitive</i> component of therapy assumes
that unreasonable jealousy is at least
partly caused by irrational beliefs about a
partner's infidelity and by a misinterpretation
of neutral stimuli as a threat to the relationship
(Dolan &amp; Bishay, 1996). Cognitive therapy,
therefore, aims to change faulty cognitive
schemata that individuals hold with regard to
their partner's infidelity and to become more
"reasonably" jealous. Therefore, in treatment,
first the individual's irrational beliefs about
the partner's infidelity are identified, as are
the origins of these cognitions (Bishay,
Petersen, &amp; Tarrier, 1989). Cognitive interventions
include techniques such as identifying
and disputing irrational beliefs (e.g., asking
oneself "Why must I be totally loved?"),
practicing rational coping using anti-jealousy
statements (e.g., "I can be a happy person
even if my partner loves others besides me"),
using cognitive distraction (e.g., thinking of
something else, meditating), and using positive
imagery (e.g., imagining defeating all rivals)
(Ellis, 1996).


Open and constructive <i>communication</i> often
is difficult for individuals experiencing
jealousy. For example, a study by Francis
(1977) showed that, in general, individuals are
reluctant to express their jealous feelings to
their partners, thereby inhibiting communication
and risking further escalation of jealous
feelings. Communication between partners
can be enhanced by techniques such as role-playing
and role reversal (i.e., pretending to
be one's partner), focusing on the possible
"jealousy" in the nonjealous partner (to enable
jealousy to be shared more equally), and
reframing jealousy as a sign of love (Ridley,
1996).


- <b>Conclusion</b>


The temptation to engage in extradyadic sex
and the tendency to respond with jealousy to
such behavior by one's partner are interrelated
and universal human phenomena, both
of which are part of our human evolutionary
heritage. Nevertheless, there is considerable
variation across individuals, relationships,
situations, and cultures in the likelihood that
one will become involved in extradydadic sex
and in the likelihood that one will exhibit various
forms of jealousy. In particular, jealousy
seems more likely, and extradyadic sex less
likely, the more a relationship is characterized
by involvement, dependency, commitment,
and secure attachment. The awareness
of the potential negative effects that
extradyadic relationships might have on primary
relationships finds expression in a virtually
universal normative disapproval of
extradyadic sex. Ironically, the potential fury
of jealousy also causes most affairs to be covert,
and this accentuates the aversive consequences
following disclosure. Jealousy will,
even among individuals who aim to have a
sexually liberal lifestyle, reliably surface
when an extradyadic sexual affair is disclosed
or discovered. Although it has potentially destructive
consequences, jealousy is basically
a response aimed at protecting the relationship
and, from an evolutionary perspective,
protecting one's reproductive opportunities.
Nevertheless, given the conflicts that both
jealousy and extradyadic sex can create in
primary relationships, these issues often
come up in the context of therapy and counseling,
and a number of therapeutic interventions
have been developed to deal with such
issues. However, given the deeply rooted motivations
that underlie both jealous and adulterous
tendencies, it would be unrealistic to
expect that any interventions or cultural
changes ever will eliminate the problems that
these tendencies can generate in intimate relationships.
