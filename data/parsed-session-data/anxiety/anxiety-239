<font size="4"><b>Chapter 18: Hope and Hopelessness</b></font>

Fascination with the phenomenon
of hope dates back to the Bible.
Hope for a better future and salvation
is a hallmark of the Scriptures. St. Paul
characterized hope as the essence of faith:
"But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who
hopes for what he already has? But if we hope
for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently"
(Romans 8: 24-25, New International
Version). A 17-century Dutch philosopher and
theologian, Baruch de Spinoza (as cited in
Bernard, 1977), defined hope as a joy that comes
from past or future images when something
is in doubt. In the late 20th century, theoretical
and scientific interest in the concept of
hope has developed among investigators and
clinicians in psychology, medicine, and nursing.


Although there are a variety of conceptualizations
of hope, there is agreement on the
essential characteristics of the concept. Hope,
a factor in coping, is future oriented and considered
to be multidimensional by most theorists.
It enables an individual to cope with a
stressful situation by expecting a positive outcome.
Because a positive outcome is expected,
the individual is motivated to act in the
face of uncertainty. There are differences in
conceptualizations with regard to whether
hope has both state and trait components,
whether it exists on a continuum with hopelessness,
and whether it is an antecedent, a
strategy, or an outcome of coping (Raleigh &amp;
Boehm, 1994).


Hope is rarely discussed without considering
hopelessness and vice versa; the relaionship
between these concepts is rarely explicated,
however. In the psychology
literature, many authors have linked hopelessness
with negative emotions. Some, such as
Beck (1963, 1967) and Bernard (1977), identify
hopelessness as a core characteristic of
depression and suicidal behavior (Alloy,
Abramson, Metalsky, &amp; Hartlage, 1988;
Beck, Kovacs, &amp; Weissman, 1975; Beck,
Weissman, Lester, &amp; Trexler, 1974; Minkoff,
Bergman, Beck, &amp; Beck, 1973). In fact, Bernard
hypothesized that hope, like depression,
may originate from "heredity, physiology and
health, environment, and personal and individual

[p. <i>438</i>]

The literature search in preparation for
the writing of this chapter included books and
research and theoretical articles published
from 1965 to 1998 by psychologists, physicians,
and nurses. Computer and hand
searches using Medline and the Cumulative
Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature
were used to identify publications with
the words "hope" or "hopelessness" in the title
or conceptual framework. The focus of the
review is nursing models and research; seminal
works in psychology were included for
background purposes, however. To be included
in this review, research articles needed
to identify the specific hope model used;
therefore, many articles are omitted from this
review. Forty-two publications met the review
criteria.


Psychologists and physicians presented
the earliest explorations of hope in the literature.
Later, nurses joined the discussion. The
oldest models can be attributed to psychologists,
predominately Lynch (1965) and
Stotland (1969). Although Lynch and other
theorists are frequently mentioned as background
for research, Stotland's model is most
often cited as the conceptual framework. In
addition, instruments to measure hope have
been developed using Stotland's model. Consequently,
I have selected it for detailed discussion.


- <b>MODELS OF HOPE IN
PSYCHOLOGY</b>


With the exception of Stotland (1969), the
earliest theorists focused their efforts on developing
a definition of hope and offering a
few propositions without producing an empirically
adequate model. Lynch (1965)
considered hope to be "the very heart and
center of a human being. It is the best resource
of man, always there on the inside,
making everything possible when he is in action,
or waiting to be illuminated when he is
ill" (p. 31). He defined hope as the fundamental
knowledge that a difficult situation can be
worked out and that goals can be reached.
Imagining and wishing are not possible for
the hopeless. Hopelessness prevents one from
imagining beyond the present.


Melges and Bowlby (1969) proposed that
"hope and hopelessness reflect a person's estimate
of the probability of his achieving certain
goals" (p. 690). The individual determines
the probability relative to past
successes and failures with similar goals. If
there is an expectation of success in meeting
goals through one's plans of action, hope exists.
If failure is predicted, hopelessness exists.
Thus, Melges and Bowlby described
hope and hopelessness as opposite expectations
and self-efficacy as a fundamental component
of self-esteem and a major element in
determining whether one feels hopeful or
hopeless. Hope encompasses goals that are
short term or long term and may involve hopefulness
about short-term goals simultaneously
with hopelessness about long-term goals.


<b><i>Stotland's Models of Hope</i></b>


The publication of Ezra Stotland's book,
<i>The Psychology of Hope</i> (1969), revolutionized
the discussions regarding the concept of
hope. Prior to this book, many investigators
considered hope and hopelessness to be vague
and indistinct concepts that prohibited quantification
and systematic study. Through a review
of the literature, Stotland developed a
theory that portrays hope as an expectation of
future goal attainment that is mediated by the
importance of the goal for the individual and
motivates action to achieve the goal. Expectation
of goal attainment and importance of the
goal are determinants of motivation. The
greater the expectation and the greater the importance

[p. <i>439</i>]

Because Stotland's (1969) model operationalized
hope for the first time, many investigators
have used it to develop instruments to
measure hope and as a framework for their research.
In the following sections, brief descriptions
of the instruments that have been
developed using Stotland's model are provided,
and studies that have used the instruments
are mentioned. The discussion ends
with an analysis of the model. This pattern
will be used throughout this chapter. The descriptions
are necessarily brief and limited to
instruments that use the models described. A
summary of published instruments (including
those not linked to a model discussed in this
chapter) is presented in Table 18.1. For in-depth
discussion of instruments and relevant
research, refer to <i>Hope and Hopelessness:
Critical Clinical Constructs</i> (Farran, Herth, et
al., 1995).


<i>Instruments Based on
Stotland's Model of Hope</i>


<i>Beck Hopelessness Scale</i>. This scale (Beck
et al., 1974) is based on Stotland's (1969)
conceptualization of hope in that it operationalizes
negative expectancies into three dimensions
of hopelessness: (a) affective, (b)
motivational, and (c) cognitive. It consists of
20 true-false items scored 0 or 1 and summed
(range 0-20). Both positive and negative
items are used with positive items reverse
scored. Higher scores indicate higher levels
of hopelessness. The Beck Hopelessness
Scale (BHS) was tested with 294 patients
hospitalized for recent suicide attempts. A
high level of internal consistency was demonstrated
(Table 18.1), and concurrent validity
was supported by a significant correlation between
clinical ratings of hopelessness and
BHS scores. Construct validity was established
by the confirmation of hypotheses in
several studies (Beck et al., 1974; Minkoff et
al., 1973; Vatz, Winig, &amp; Beck, 1969). The
BHS has found much use, most notably as a
measure of divergent validity for other instruments.
It is unidimensional although simple
to administer, and it has well-established reliability
and validity.


<i>The Hope Scale</i>. This scale (Erickson, Post,
&amp; Paige, 1975) was the first to be based on
Stotland's (1969) conceptualization of hope.
It consists of 20 future goals "common in our
society" (p. 324). In the first section, subjects
rate the importance of each goal on a 7-point
scale. In the second section of the scale, subjects
rate the same items on a 0 to 100 scale of
probability of occurrence. The scale was
tested for stability with psychiatric patients
(Table 18.1). Construct validity was assessed
through hypotheses tested as described later.
The Hope Scale focuses on one dimension of
hope and has limited applicability to use in
diverse populations because the goals are
common for individuals in adulthood through
midlife. The scales of 1 to 7 and 0 to 100 are
cumbersome and difficult for subjects.


<i>Stoner Hope Scale</i>. Conceptualizations for
the Stoner Hope Scale (SHS; Stoner, 1982)
include works by Stotland (1969), Lynch
(1965), and Marcel (1967). It is a revision of
the Hope Scale (Erickson et al., 1975) and
consists of 30 goals, 10 for each domain
(Global, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal).
Both the importance and the probability sections
have a 4-point scale, and scores are obtained
by multiplying the probability score by
the importance score for each goal. Summing
the products for the appropriate items produces
the subscale scores and total hope
score. Divergent validity was assessed with
the BHS producing a significant negative correlation
(Table 18.1). A high level of internal
consistency was also reported. Although developed
to be a multidimensional scale, the
SHS has not undergone factor analysis. It is

[p. <i>443</i>]

<i>Hopelessness Scale for Children</i>. The BHS
was the model for the development of the
Hopelessness Scale for Children (HSC;
Kazdin, French, Unis, Esveldt-Dawson, &amp;
Sherick, 1983). The BHS was reworked to be
appropriate for children 6 years of age or
older. It contains 17 dichotomous (true-false)
items with scores that range from 0 to 17
(higher scores mean greater hopelessness). A
high level of internal consistency was demonstrated
(Table 18.1) With a sample of 66 psychiatric
inpatient children, validity was established
with moderate to high correlations
between hopelessness and lower self-esteem
and greater severity of depression. As with
the BHS, this scale is unidimensional. In addition,
there is a need to explore the relationship
between hope and developmental level.
The HSC may have some limitation for
young children because of reading level.


<i>Hope Index</i>. The conceptual framework for
Staats's (1989) Hope Index (HI) is derived
from Stotland's (1969) and Beck's (1967)
work. The 16 goal statements of the HI are
rated by respondents on a 6-point scale for
degree of desire for the goal and degree of expectation
for attaining the goal. Eight of the
goals are "personally-focused" and 8 are
"other-focused." A score is obtained by multiplying
the desire score by the expectation
score and summing the 16 items. The higher
the score, the higher the level of hope. Internal
consistency is adequate, and stability is
moderate (Table 18.1). Concurrent criterion-related
validity was also demonstrated to be
moderate. Divergent validity was assessed by
a significantly negative correlation with the
BHS. Factor analysis supported the two
subscales of self and other. The HI is consistent
with its conceptual framework. Although
the HI is brief, the instructions and appearance
are somewhat complex and limit its use.
<i>Snyder Hope Scale</i>. Another tool based on
Stotland's (1969) work, the Snyder Hope
Scale (SNHS; Snyder et al., 1991), consists of
12 items on a 4-point scale. Four items assess
goal-directed determination, 4 assess planning
ways to achieve the goal, and 4 are fillers.
In samples of healthy adults and adults
with psychiatric illnesses, internal consistency
and stability were evaluated (Table
18.1). Concurrent validity was established
with positive correlations between SNHS
and measures of self-esteem, expectancy for
success, life experience, and life orientation.
Divergent validity was assessed by a negative
correlation with the BHS. The SNHS
is promising as a clinical measure because
of its brevity and simplicity. It is limited in
its dimensions because it is confined to rational
goals and omits relational or spiritual
goals.


<i>Multidimensional Hope Scale</i>. This scale
(Raleigh &amp; Boehm, 1994) was adapted from
the SHS and is based on Stotland's (1969)
theory of hope. It consists of 37 items on 4-point
scales for importance of the goal and
perceived probability of occurrence. A
weighted probability score for each item,
which makes zero the midpoint (score - 2.5 =
weighted score), is multiplied by each importance
score. Subscale scores and total hope
scores are produced by summation of the
cross-products for each item. The Multidimensional
Hope Scale (MDHS) was tested
with community-based adults with chronic
conditions. High levels of internal consistency
and stability were demonstrated (Table
18.1). Divergent validity was established by a
correlation with the BHS. Factor analysis resulted
in a six-factor solution. These six factors
comprise the subscales of civic interest,
health, spirituality, self-actualization, social
support, and resource to others. The MDHS
expands to include dimensions not assessed
by some other instruments. Its usefulness in
the clinical setting is limited due to its length
and complexity in scoring.

[p. <i>444</i>]

<i>Research That Used
Stotland's Model</i>


The literature search resulted in several
studies that were based on Stotland's (1969)
model. The proposed relationship between
hopefulness and mental health has been supported
by studies involving hospitalized psychiatric
patients and college students (Erickson
et al., 1975) in which significant
relationships were found between lower levels
of hope and psychopathology and greater anxiety.
Similarly, in community-based older
adults (Farran &amp; McCann, 1989; Farran &amp;
Popovich, 1990) and geropsychiatric inpatients
(Farran, Wiken, &amp; Fidler, 1995), the
best predictors of hope were mental health,
social support, physical health, and activities
of daily living. In addition, hope has been positively
related to social function and morale
(Rideout &amp; Montemuro, 1986).


Stotland's (1969) model of hope has also
been used in studies of populations with physical
illnesses. In support of Stotland's (1969)
proposition that hope is a component of adaptive
action, significant positive relationships
have been found between the level of hope
and the level of coping (Herth, 1989) and
strong religious convictions (Brandt, 1987;
Herth, 1989; Raleigh, 1992) in adult patients
with cancer and other chronic conditions.
Unpredictability has been found to be
inversely related to hopefulness and motivation
(Mishel, Hostetter, King, &amp; Graham,
1984; Staples &amp; Jeffrey, 1997); that is, the
greater the unpredictability of a situation,
the less the expectation of achievement (or
hope) and motivation to act. Support for
Stotland's proposition that increased anxiety
motivates the individual to try to escape
it was found in studies of individuals with
a variety of chronic conditions, including cancer
(Raleigh, 1992) and geropsychiatric inpatients
(Farran, Wiken, et al., 1995). Strategies
for improving hopefulness reported by
participants included keeping active, participating
in religious activities, thinking about
other things, and talking with others—all
means of distracting one from the source of
anxiety.


Researchers have found no significant
differences in level of hope based on phase of
illness in adults with cancer (Ballard, Green,
McCaa, &amp; Logsdon, 1997; Brandt, 1987; Raleigh,
1992; Stoner &amp; Keampfer, 1985). This
may suggest no support for the proposition
that hope is perceived probability of goal attainment;
it may be a function of what the patient
perceives as the goal, however. Raleigh
(1992) found that patients at different stages
of illness reported hopes with different
timelines. Those who were terminally ill
tended to focus on hopes in the short term;
nevertheless, they considered themselves very
hopeful.


<i>Analysis of Stotland's
Model of Hope</i>


Stotland's (1969) model of hope has been
widely used and tested by nurse researchers
and psychologists, leading to significant support
for many relationships in the model. According
to Walker and Avant (1995), "A theory
is an internally consistent group of
relational statements that presents a systematic
view about a phenomenon and that is useful
for description, explanation, prediction,
and/or control" (p. 26). Stotland's model of
hope provides an understanding of the concept
that meets these requirements. The model
is logically adequate in that predictions can be
and have been made from it. Several researchers
have tested these predictions, and they
make sense and there are no obvious logical
fallacies. Stotland's model has proved to be
useful. It has been used to develop several
measures of hope and hopelessness, and it has
been used by many researchers as a conceptual
framework. It is broadly generalizable to
various populations and situations as demonstrated
by the variety of research it has generated.
It also has parsimony in that it can be described
using few concepts and relationships,
but it is broad in its application. If the theory is
to be empirically testable, the components of
the model must have operational definitions
(Fawcett, 1984). Stotland initiated the study
of hope by being the first to operationalize it.
As a result, many studies have been conducted

-<b>MODELS OF HOPE
IN NURSING</b>


The concept of hope has immediate application
for nursing practice. In the process of
caring for the whole individual, the presence
or absence of hopefulness is evident to the
nurse. Anecdotally, nurses report instances in
which hopefulness or hopelessness appeared
to impact the client outcome. The North
American Nursing Diagnosis Association
(NANDA) recognizes the nursing diagnosis
of hopelessness, which is defined as "a state
in which an individual sees limited or no alternatives
or personal choices available and is
unable to mobilize energy on his/her behalf"
(Kim, McFarland, &amp; McLane, 1997, p. 41).
Conceptualizations of hopefulness and hopelessness
began to appear in the nursing literature
long before NANDA developed hopelessness
as a diagnosis. Two of the earliest
nurse authors in this area were Travelbee
(1971) and Lange (1978). In the early 1980s,
nurses began to use hope models in their research.


Travelbee (1971) addressed hope and
hopelessness in discussing the critical care
nurse's role. She proposed that "hope is something
halfway between knowing and willing"
(p. 161) what will happen in the future. It suggests
solutions to problems, imparts security
in this knowledge, and generates energy that
produces motivation to act. On the basis of
this definition, Travelbee advocated for the
nurse's role in fostering hopefulness in patients.
Lange (1978) described the concept of
hope and differentiated it from similar concepts
of wishing, expectation, and optimism.
A model of hope began to take form in nursing
with Lange's explication of the hope
structure as a process for maintaining hope.
Soon after, nurses began to develop and test
their models, beginning with Miller (1983).
These models are presented in the following
sections. Models with supporting subsequent
research are detailed in greater depth. Nursing
models without subsequent research are listed
in the Appendix for further reference.


<i><b>Miller's Model of Hope</b></i>


Miller (1983, 1992) states that hope is a
complex multidimensional construct. It is
more than goal attainment; it encompasses a
state of being. It involves a confident expectation
of an ongoing good state or liberation
from a difficult situation. Hope exists at three
levels that are depicted in Figure 18.1. The
first level focuses on superficial wishes, is
characterized by shallow optimism, requires
little psychic energy to maintain, and produces
no despair when it is not actualized.
The second level focuses on hoping for relationships,
self-improvement, and personal accomplishments
and involves greater psychic
energy than the first level. If these hopes are
not actualized, anxiety results. The third level
is related to a desire for relief from suffering,
personal trial, or entrapment and involves a
total dedication of psychic energy. If the individual
perceives that relief is not impending,
deep despair or giving up occur.


Miller and Powers (1988) identified 11
essential elements of hope from interviews of
critically ill patients. Mutuality and affiliation
pertain to interpersonal relationships and the
experience of unconditional love. Sense of the
possible involves a global attitude that there is
potential in life. Avoidance of absolutizing
entails allowing flexibility in one's expectations
and avoiding an all-or-nothing attitude.
Anticipation embraces the confident expectation
of some future good combined with acceptance
of the need to patiently wait. Establishing
and achieving goals are the "objects of
one dimension of hope" (p. 418). Psychologic
well-being and coping are factors that empower
the individual to have the necessary
psychic energy. Purpose and meaning in life
give the individual something to live for and
to receive a sense of satisfaction with life.
Freedom is the ability to recognize that the individual
can impact an outcome and maintain
a positive attitude. Reality surveillance involves
cognitive tasks designed to obtain information

<i>Instrument Based on Miller's
Model of Hope</i>


<i>Miller Hope Scale</i>. The Miller Hope Scale
(MHS; Miller &amp; Powers, 1988) was derived
from Miller's conceptualization of hope. It
contains 40 items that are rated on a 5-point
scale. Higher scores indicate higher hope.
Some items are reverse scored to avoid response
set. A high level of internal consistency
and stability were demonstrated in a
sample of college students (Table 18.1). Criterion-related
concurrent validity was assessed
by correlations with measures of psychological
well-being and existential well-being.
Divergent validity was assessed with
the BHS. Factor analysis resulted in a three-factor
solution: Factor I, satisfaction with
self, others, and life; Factor II, avoidance of
hope threats; and Factor III, anticipation of a
future. The MHS has been used in numerous
studies with adequate to excellent psychometric
properties reported (Beckerman &amp;
Northrop, 1996; Foote, Piazza, Holcombe,
Paul, &amp; Daffin, 1990), and it has been translated
into several languages. It may be limited
in its clinical use by its length. The items are
conceptually consistent with the model.


<i>Research That Used Miller's Hope Model</i>


Many studies have used the MHS as the
measure of hope, but most of these used a
conceptual framework related to other variables,
such as uncertainty, and are therefore
not included in this review (Brackney &amp;
Westman, 1992; Fehring, Miller, &amp; Shaw,
1997; Irvin &amp; Acton, 1997; McGill &amp; Paul,
1993; Zorn &amp; Johnson, 1997). In addition,
some research used Miller's hope model as
the conceptual framework but focused on the
Hope-Despair model by Miller, a model of
hope-inspiring strategies. These are discussed
later.


The finding of lower scores on the MHS
for a sample of elderly adults living in a long-term
care facility compared to those of the

[p. <i>447</i>]

The roles of psychological well-being
and coping in hope are supported by findings
of a significant positive correlation between
hope and caregiver well-being (Irvin &amp; Acton,
1997). In addition, hope was shown to be a
mediator of the relationship between stress
and well-being. Although significant positive
correlations were found between hope and education
and financial status in one study of the
elderly (McGill &amp; Paul, 1993), there was no
correlation with education in another study
(Mishel et al., 1984). Higher education and income
would be expected to increase sense of
well-being and avoidance of hope threats.


Support for the roles of purpose and
meaning in life and mutuality and affiliation
can be found in significant positive correlations
between religious well-being or intrinsic
religiosity and hope (Fehring et al., 1997;
Zom &amp; Johnson, 1997) and self-esteem and
social support and hope (Foote et al., 1990).
Furthermore, hope accounted for 31% of the
variance in religious well-being, the only significant
predictor in this study.


A negative correlation between hope and
external locus of control suggests that the perception
of chance associated with external locus
of control reduces perceptions of the ability
to attain relief from a personal trial or
suffering (Brackney &amp; Westman, 1992). No
relationship was found between hope or hopelessness
and the measure of internal locus of
control.


<i>Analysis of Miller's Model of Hope</i>


Miller's (1983, 1992) model of hope focuses
on definitions of concepts related to
hope, with a few statements of relationships
among the concepts. This reduces its ability to
explain, predict, or control phenomena. The
sparseness of relational statements also hinders
the model's logical adequacy in that relationships
cannot be diagrammed (Walker &amp;
Avant, 1995). Miller's model has proved to
have limited usefulness to researchers who
used the MHS but chose to use another conceptual
framework. It is broadly generalizable
to many populations and situations and has
been used with various groups, including college
students (Miller &amp; Powers, 1988), elderly
(Beckerman &amp; Northrup, 1996; Fehring et al.,
1997), the chronically ill (Hirth &amp; Stewart,
1994; Miller, 1992), the critically ill (Miller,
1989), and their spouses (Patel, 1996). It lacks
parsimony in that it uses many concepts and
unclear relationships. Miller has developed an
operational definition of hope that lends itself
to testing. As a result, many studies have been
conducted that use the MHS to operationalize
hope, but its empirical adequacy has not been
demonstrated.


<i><b>Self-Sustaining
Process Model</b></i>


Hinds and Martin (1988) used the
grounded theory approach to develop a definition
of hope and the Self-Sustaining Process
model. Grounded theory approach is an inductive
research technique first described by
Glaser and Strauss (1967). A theory evolves
from the research process that involves formulation,
testing, and redevelopment of propositions.


According to Hinds (1984, 1988a), hope,
for adolescents, is defined as "the degree to
which an adolescent believes that a personal
tomorrow exists" (1984, p. 360). There are
four hierarchical levels of believing in this
model: (a) forced effort, (b) personal possibilities,
(c) expectation of a better tomorrow, and
(d) anticipation of a personal future. With
forced effort, the adolescent exhibits a more
positive attitude that is artificial. Personal possibilities
refers to the adolescent's belief that
second chances exist for the self. A general
positive future orientation is characteristic of
expectation of a better tomorrow, and a specific

Hinds and Martin (1988) conceptualized
the Self-Sustaining Process by which adolescents
help themselves achieve hopefulness
during their illness experience. This process
involves four sequential phases; each phase
has specific strategies associated with it (Figure
18.2).


The first phase of the Self-Sustaining
Process is cognitive discomfort (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>), the degree
to which mental uneasiness is experienced
related to disheartening or negative
thoughts. The second phase is distraction (<i>T</i><sub>2</sub>),
in which the negative thoughts are replaced
with neutral or positive thoughts and conditions
through cognitive and behavioral activities.
The third phase is cognitive comfort (<i>T</i><sub>3</sub>),
which encompasses the experience of solace,
lifted spirits, and consideration of future possibilities.
The fourth phase is personal competence
(<i>T</i><sub>4</sub>), in which adolescents view themselves
as "resilient, resourceful, and adaptable
in the face of serious health threats" (Hinds &amp;
Martin, 1988, p. 339). Movement through
the process is indicated by a plus sign in Figure
18.2.


Hinds and Martin (1988) concluded that
the Self-Sustaining Process is variable in that
it can occur in minutes or weeks. Some phases
take longer than others and may be bypassed.
They also found positive relationships among
the concepts (e.g., greater cognitive discomfort
relates to more attempts at distraction).
Also, behaviors and attitudes of others, including
nurses, can influence the adolescent's
movement through the process.


<i>Instrument Based on the Self-Sustaining
Process Model</i>


<i>Hopefulness Scale for Adolescents</i>. The
Hopefulness Scale for Adolescents (HSA;
Hinds &amp; Gattuso, 1991) is a 24-item visual
analog scale based on Hinds's (1984) conceptualization
of hope and was developed from
statements made by adolescents in her
grounded theory work. According to Hinds,
hope is the extent to which an adolescent expects
a positive future. An open-ended question
at the end of the scale asks adolescents to
identify specific, hoped-for goals. Then, the
researcher estimates the probability of attaining
the hoped-for goals. Scores can range
from 0 to 2,400. The higher scores indicate
higher hopefulness.


The authors constructed two alternate
forms because of the volatility of hopefulness
and the need to take repeated measurements
on the same individual. Comparability of the
forms was assessed statistically but not specified
(Hinds &amp; Gattuso, 1991). Internal consistencies
for the instrument are moderate to
high (Table 18.1). Although construct validity
assessment has been reported, no specific
findings have been published. The HSA is the
only scale designed for adolescents and that
has alternate forms. It is relatively easy to administer.
It is limited, however, to rational
thought and relational dimensions of hope.


<i>Research That Used the
Self-Sustaining Process Model</i>


Three studies were found that used the
Self-Sustaining Process model and the HSA.
Two support the importance of the perception
that others have hope for the individual as described
in the Self-Sustaining Process. The
third study (Connelly, 1998) examined the relationship
between adolescent pregnancy status
and hopefulness and found none; hope
scores for the sample were not reported, however.
A longitudinal, correlational study of 25
adolescents receiving treatment for substance
abuse (Hinds, 1988b) found a positive correlation
between hope and adolescents' perception
of degree of caring by the nurses. Another
study of 99 high school students found that
hopefulness helps to explain the relationship
between perceived social support and general
well-being (Yarcheski, Scoloveno, &amp; Mahon,
1994). These researchers surmised that
greater social support fosters adolescent hopefulness
or the "comforting life-sustaining belief
that a personal and positive future exists"
(Hinds, 1984, p. 3), which contributes to general
well-being. Much additional research is
needed to support the adequacy of this model.

<i>Analysis of the Self-Sustaining
Process Model</i>


The Self-Sustaining Process (Hinds &amp;
Martin, 1988) provides an understanding of
hopefulness in adolescents that shows promise
for description, explanation, prediction,
and control. The model is logically adequate
in that relationships are clear and predictions
can be made from it (Walker &amp; Avant, 1995).
This model may prove to be useful in a narrow
population of adolescents. It has been used to
develop a measure of hope, although it has not
been used widely as a conceptual framework.
It is narrowly generalizable to the adolescent
population, and it has parsimony in that it can
be described using relatively few concepts
and relationships. The Self-Sustaining Process
model operationalizes hope for the
adolescent and should stimulate more research
to test its empirical adequacy.


<i><b>Dufault and Martocchio's
Model of Hope</b></i>


Dufault and Martocchio (1985) also used
the grounded theory approach to develop a
conceptualization of hope. The researchers
described their methodology as "participant
observation in multiple settings" (pp. 379-380).
Hope is defined as "a <i>Multidimensional</i>
dynamic life force characterized by a <i>confident</i>
yet <i>uncertain</i> expectation of achieving a

[p. <i>450</i>]

The spheres are generalized hope and
particularized hope. Generalized hope relates
to a sense of an indeterminate future good.
Dufault and Martocchio (1985) note that
"generalized hope protects against despair
when a person is deprived of particular hopes,
and preserves or restores the meaningfulness
of life—past, present, and future—in circumstances
of all kinds" (p. 380). Particularized
hope focuses on a specific hope object that
"may be concrete or abstract, explicitly stated
or implied" (p. 380) and stimulates coping
with obstacles and strategies for attaining the
hope object.


Dufault and Martocchio (1985) described
the following dimensions of hope: affective,
cognitive, behavioral, affiliative, temporal,
and contextual. The affective dimension focuses
on "sensations and emotions that are
part of the hoping process" (p. 382). It involves
feelings of confidence, uncertainty,
and personal significance about the outcome.
The cognitive dimension focuses on "the processes
by which individuals wish, imagine,
wonder, perceive, think, remember, learn,
generalize, interpret, and judge in relation to
hope" (p. 384). The behavioral dimension focuses
on "the action orientation of the hoping
person in relation to hope" (p. 385). Actions
taken may be those designed to directly
achieve a hope or those motivated by, but do
not directly affect, the desired outcome, such
as praying or following religious customs.
The affiliative dimension focuses on "the hoping
person's sense of relatedness or involvement
beyond self as it bears upon hope" (p.
386). This dimension pertains to relationships
with people and God and may be expressed as
a reliance on or receptivity to help from others.
The temporal dimension focuses on "the
hoping person's experience of time (past,
present, and future) in relation to hopes and
hoping. Hope is directed toward a future
good, but past and present are also involved in

Dufault and Martocchio (1985) do not
consider hope and hopelessness to be polar
opposites on a continuum. Individuals may
be hopeful for one outcome and hopeless
in relation to another outcome. The multidimensionality
and process orientation of hope
ensure that there is always hope for something.


<i>Instruments Based on Dufault and
Martocchio's Model of Hope</i>


<i>Herth Hope Scale</i>. The Herth Hope Scale
(HHS; Herth, 1991) consists of 30 positive
and negative items contained in three subscales:

[p. <i>451</i>]

<i>Herth Hope Index</i>. The Herth Hope Index
(HHI; Herth, 1992) was adapted from the
HHS and designed to be used in the clinical
setting. This shortened version consists of 12
items developed from items on the HHS that
are in a 4-point scale with a higher score indicating
higher levels of hope. Internal consistency
and stability were high (Table 18.1).
Correlation between the HHS and the HHI
was .92. Factor analysis with varimax rotation
resulted in a three-factor solution consistent
with the HHS. The HHI contains all the
dimensions and assets of the HHS, but it is a
brief version that can be used in clinical settings.


<i>Research That Used Dufault and
Martocchio's Model of Hope</i>


Because few relationships are proposed
in Dufault and Martocchio's (1985) model of
hope, research using this model tends to focus
on confirming variables that can be related to
hope. Thus, researchers are using an inductive
method to add to the model. Significant positive
relationships have been found between
higher level of hope and level of coping response,
strong faith, and no interference with
family role responsibilities in a sample of
adult cancer patients (Herth, 1991). This offers
initial confirmation of the role of these
variables in hopefulness. In a sample of elderly
widows or widowers, Herth (1990a) also
found a positive relationship between level of
hope and the use of positive coping styles
identified by Jalowiec (1987) as confrontive,
optimistic, palliative, supportant, and self-reliant.
A significant negative relationship was
found between level of hope and negative coping
styles: evasive, emotive, and fatalistic.
These findings support the positive role particularized
hope plays in coping. Herth found
a significant positive relationship between
level of hope and level of grief resolution,
which can be a result of effective coping.
Hope accounted for 79% of the variance in
grief resolution.


Research has also resulted in a greater
understanding of the temporal dimension. Interviews
of healthy older adults revealed differences
in focus and future orientation of
hope "based on age, place of residence, health
status, and functional ability" (Herth, 1993, p.
146). Consistent with other studies based on
Stotland's model of hope (Ballard et al., 1997;
Raleigh, 1992; Stoner &amp; Keampfer, 1985), extent
of illness was not found to be related to
level of hope in a sample of adult cancer patients
(Herth, 1991). These findings support
the explanation that hope is directed toward a
future good regardless of the context.


<i>Analysis of Dufault and
Martocchio's Model of Hope</i>


Dufault and Martocchio's (1985) model
of hope defines the elements of hope but presents
few relational statements. As with
Miller's model of hope, this reduces its ability
to explain, predict, or control phenomena and
hinders the model's logical adequacy (Walker
&amp; Avant, 1995). The proposed relationship
between hope and coping has proven to have
usefulness to researchers who have developed
measures of hope or used it as a conceptual
framework for their studies or both. It is
broadly generalizable to many populations
and situations and has been used with various
groups ranging from healthy elderly to individuals
with cancer. It lacks parsimony in that
it uses many concepts and few relationships
are clear. Dufault and Martocchio have developed
an operational definition of hope that has
resulted in instrument development and testing.
Due to the limited number of studies using

-<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY,
PRACTICE, AND RESEARCH</b>


<i><b>Hope and Coping</b></i>


Although it may be obvious to all but the
casual observer that hope and coping are interrelated
concepts, the literature does not
consistently address the existence or nature of
this relationship. Often, hope is described as a
coping strategy (Bruhn, 1984; Korner, 1970;
Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984; Raleigh &amp; Boehm,
1994), but it may also be described as an antecedent
to coping (Dufault &amp; Martocchio,
1985; Owen, 1989; Weisman, 1979) or as an
outcome of coping (Engel, 1968; Farran &amp;
McCann, 1989). In fact, hope may have a role
in all three aspects of coping. As an antecedent,
hope influences how the individual perceives
the situation that may be a challenge or
threat to goals. As a coping strategy, hope enables
the individual to appraise the situation
as a challenge rather than a threat and to muster
problem-focused or emotional-focused resources
(Farran, Herth, et al., 1995). Finally,
as an outcome, hope results from the use of
coping strategies, such as prayer and interpersonal
interaction (Raleigh, 1992). Hopelessness,
however, occurs when coping becomes
ineffective (Farran, Herth, et al., 1995;
Stotland, 1969).


Some research supports hope as a coping
strategy. In a study of adolescents with cancer,
Hinds (1988b) found that participants reported
using two strategies, forgetting cancer
and hopefulness, to achieve cognitive comfort,
which is part of the larger coping process.
Other research suggests that hope is an
outcome of using coping mechanisms. In a
study of 45 individuals with chronic conditions,
Raleigh (1992) found that participants
reported using strategies to maintain hope
such as physical activity, religious activities,
mental distraction, or interaction with others.
Herth (1989) found that hope and coping responses
were related in a study of 120 cancer
patients and suggested that fostering hope in
the cancer patient is important for the coping
response. The Coping Process Nursing Model
developed by Herth depicts hope and coping
resources as equal components in the coping
process that affect the coping response either
positively or negatively. These findings suggest
that additional discussion of and research
on the relationship between hope and coping
are essential.


<i><b>Nursing Practice Implications</b></i>


Intuitively and anecdotally, nurses understand
the important roles that hope plays in
achieving and maintaining wellness and that
hopelessness plays in illness and death. Evidence
to support these assumptions is accumulating.
Numerous studies have indicated
the role of hopelessness in psychopathology
(Beck et al., 1975; Beck, Steer, Kovacs, &amp;
Garrison, 1985; Farran &amp; Popovich, 1990;
Minkoff et al., 1973). Schmale and Iker
(1971) documented a relationship between
hopelessness and the occurrence of cervical
carcinoma. Scientists documented a correlation
between hope and immune system function
(Udelman, 1982; Udelman &amp; Udelman,
1985), but research in this area has not continued.
Because of the promising results of
Udelman's study, additional research in this
area is warranted. In addition, studies have
shown that nurses are sources of hope for their
clients (Dufault, 1981; Herth, 1990a, 1990b,
1993; Hinds, 1988b; Miller, 1989; Raleigh,
1992). Because of increasing evidence and the
position of influence that nurses have in relation
to patients and their families, nurses must
be proactive in supporting hope in clients.
Various strategies, based on theory or descriptive
research, have been proposed.


An understanding of strategies for fostering
hope begins with identifying those reportedly
used by clients. Several studies (Herth,
1990b, 1993; Miller, 1989; Patel, 1996; Raleigh,
1992) have demonstrated fairly consistent
findings with regard to activities that individuals
report that they use, although the order

[p. <i>453</i>]

Interventions to foster hope have been
proposed by nurses. Common ones include (a)
providing comfort and pain relief (Herth,
1995; Johnson, Dahlen, &amp; Roberts, 1997), (b)
facilitating relationships with family and
health care providers (Herth, 1995; Kim,
1989), (c) assisting to define and redefine
hopes (Herth, 1995; Johnson et al., 1997), (d)
facilitating an expression of spirituality
(Herth, 1995), and (e) encouraging awareness
of small positive aspects of a situation (Herth,
1995; Johnson et al., 1997). Herth's (1995)
study of 141 hospice and home health care
nurses found that nurses rated similar interventions
as useful and effective for terminally
and chronically ill patients. Providing pain
control and comfort was reported by both
groups of nurses as most useful and most effective.
Both groups also rated connectedness
with others very highly.


Miller (1992) developed a model (Figure
18.4) that summarizes the types of nursing
strategies that may be useful to foster hope in
patients. These strategies relate to several of
the critical elements of hope described in her
conceptual model. Nurses may foster hope
through the affiliative dimension by promoting
sustaining relationships and connectedness
with others. Nurses can also enhance
patients' sense of control or support them, if
necessary, to temporarily relinquish control.
Nurses can use a life-promoting interpersonal
framework by maintaining a positive focus
that emphasizes the patient's potential for recovery
or adaptation or both. Expanding the
patient's and family's coping repertoire and
supporting the patient's reality surveillance
will also foster hopes. Finally, nurses should
provide assistance with identifying or revising
goals or both and supporting and encouraging
the patient's relationship with God or a meaningful
Higher Being.


Nurses have been reticent to conduct intervention
studies related to hope-fostering
strategies. This may be explained by the focus
on development of conceptual frameworks
and instruments to accurately measure hope,
but it is more likely that this reticence derives
from the difficulty in isolating hope from so
many other confounding variables, such as
coping effectiveness and self-esteem. Much
nursing research has focused on determining
the relationships between hope and these
other variables. It is time, however, for nurses
to address this issue.


<i><b>Implications for Research</b></i>


In examining the level of theory development
for the concepts of hope and hopelessness,
it is apparent that, although much theorizing
has occurred, there has not been much
empirical testing of the theories and models.
Even though investigators routinely identify
the conceptual framework for their studies,
they seldom address whether the study findings
support or are related to the aspects of the
model. Efforts have focused on determining
relationships that exist between hope and
other concepts without examining how these
concepts relate to the conceptual framework
of the study.

This lack of focus on specific theory testing
may be explained by the fact that much of
the theory regarding hope in the nursing literature
is in the concept development stage
(Walker &amp; Avant, 1995). In an effort to determine
relational statements, nursing research
focuses on finding relationships between hope
and other concepts. Although the interest in
hope has geometrically increased in the past
two decades, the research has been broad and
unfocused. Some studies have used nursing
hope models as conceptual frameworks, but
many other studies have used a variety of concepts
other than hope as the framework. There
is a distinct need for nurses to attend to the
purposeful building of theory around the concept
of hope. In addition, research needs to
focus on the testing of strategies used and reported
by nurses for fostering hope. Interventions
based on theory and suggested by the
research literature should be tested for their
empirical effectiveness with a variety of patient
populations.


-<b>CONCLUSION</b>


Hope is a concept that is extremely important
in understanding the coping process. Although
several models of hope have been proposed,
the role of hope in the coping process
is not clearly understood. Hope models need
additional testing and, specifically, the relationship
between hope and the coping process
needs to be more carefully examined. In addition,
interventions need to be related to current
theories and tested for effectiveness.
There is much work to be done in relation to
the concept of hope. To paraphrase St. Paul,
"the harvest is plenty and the workers are
few."
