Laura kicks the wall five times during a manic episode (she has
bipolar disorder) because Sandra claims that Laura's smoking near
the patio door has irritated her asthma. Instead of kicking Sandra,
Laura kicks the wall, bruising her toes badly, and spends the
afternoon in the local ER, happily sipping diet soda while having
her foot wrapped and enjoying a Darvocet-induced haze. The result
is an additional Group Therapy session during which everyone is
anti-Sandra and staff cracks down on the cliques that have formed
within the group.


Clique number one (the aggressive, dominant, bulimic clique):
Holly, Laura, me. We tear around the EDC, yelling about how

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387561-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While technically part of the bulimic clique, I am often too
caught up in my own misery to effectively incite mayhem on our
floor. I am too busy tossing my snack off the deck when no one is
looking, sneaking down the hall to purge during some drama on
the floor after dinner, or changing my clothes thirteen times a day
because I believe they all make me look fat.


During a gynecology consult, I step on the scale when the
nurse isn't watching and move the bars around until they are even
and I know my weight. At the same consult, as soon as the nurse
leaves the room for me to change, I hide my snack of oyster crackers
deep in the trash can filled with medical waste.


Once I learn that team-building activities are imminent, I voice
my opinion rather loudly.


"Team building makes me hate myself," I yell.


"You really need to work on your attitude today," says RC
Shannon. I give her the finger once she turns around.

Clique number two (the passive, submissive, mostly anorexic
clique): Eliza, Danielle, Sandra. They go to bed at 9:00 PM and
mostly sit on the sofas and knit. The bulimic clique's boisterousness
makes them nervous.


We are supposed to go to a Milwaukee Brewers game tonight,
but Therapist Elaine thinks it's a good idea to do team-building
activities instead, to facilitate a better group dynamic and erode
some of the bulimic clique's power.


I have been looking forward to the Brewers game for weeks.
Baseball reminds me of summer evenings as a child, driving to
Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh to watch the Pirates play, back
when they were good. Baseball games were happy times when I ate
popcorn, watched fireworks, and tailgated with my family.


Team-building activities are scheduled for after dinner. I simmer
with anger all through dinner; I can barely swallow my Cuban
black bean casserole. After dinner we sit on the porch and smoke,
while talking about boycotting team building. The program motto is
"Challenge by choice," and we are ready to choose.


"What the fuck are they going to make us do, sing 'Kumbaya'
and hold hands?" asks Holly.


We make up our own version of "Kumbaya." It goes like this:
"Kumbaya, this blows, suck my ass. Kumbaya, this blows, suck my
ass. Oh, Shannon, suck my ass."


Therapist Elaine overhears us and is not pleased. We get a
lecture about positive attitude.


After slamming the patio door so hard the glass shakes, Holly

I refuse to say "Team Turtle." We go back to the beginning.


Here I am, twenty-three years old and forced to participate in
some ridiculous team-building activity. I am absolutely livid with
pent-up rage. I manage to mutter "Team Turtle" and hop, just so we
can get the activity over with.


Back inside, Shannon and Julia make us all hold hands and
twist into a messed-up circle. We are supposed to work together to
untangle ourselves. The whole scene feels unreal; I am so angry that
I am calm. After we untangle ourselves, we are sent to our rooms
to pick a song that symbolizes a happy time for us. I know this is
dangerous territory.


I pick the song "Wildflowers" by Tom Petty because it reminds
me of the spring days at the end of my senior year of college that I
spent driving around Lake Erie with my ex-boyfriend Jordan. It was
a time when I was not actively eating-disordered; I stopped purging
when I started dating Jordan. I was happy with my life then. Jordan
used to sing "Wildflowers" to me, emphasizing the lyric "You belong
with your love on your arm, you belong somewhere you feel free."


I left Jordan when I left Pennsylvania.

We play our favorite songs for the whole group. Some residents
have Christian songs, others hard rock. I am fine until Danielle
puts on "My Immortal" by Evanescence. I start wailing. I curl
into a ball on the sofa and choke and gasp and heave. Laura tries to
wipe my nose, Holly puts her arms around me, Eliza smoothes my
hair, and Shannon and Julia coax me to play my song. Eliza puts
"Wildflowers" on the stereo and I cry harder; it is the kind of crying
that hurts your lungs and makes you hysterical with grief that
is so built up, you can't even begin to figure out what it's about,
much less talk about it.


Do you want to talk about why you're crying?" asks Julia.


"No."


When I calm down, I apologize for singing the inappropriate
version of "Kumbaya," for slamming the patio door so hard the floor
shook, and for telling Julia I was "fanfuckintabulous." Shannon and
Julia accept my apology and say they are happy I have broken open.
