BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
PATIENT: Not a whole lot they can do about that.
COUNSELOR: No.
PATIENT: I have some fairly specific - stuff to start off with. Two things. One is that last Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and, you know, part of Monday, I had a really weird sort of - experience. I really - I was really in trouble. I, I - was not doing well at all. I, I - I, I was sort of walking around and kind of scared. And I wasn't able think through what I think. And - all of a sudden I [think I] (ph) had, like - 
(loud background noise - electronic sound and shaking a chain?)
They can tell me to see - see you. [0:01:08.5]
Anyway - it was very, very odd. It was very upsetting. I, I was - I, I would occasionally sort of - it was almost continual. It was chemical in nature. But - I- nothing had changed. I even quit taking the (lithium) and started taking the amphetamine. And it lasted for several days - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: The level, like an intoxication or a change - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Well, like - a withdrawal. No, more like a -. What was that stuff they used to give - like when it was first (inaudible at 0:01:47.0), Thorazine or something? [I mean, I was just sort of] (ph) completely - complete disorientation. I could sort of rise up and do one thing; and then I basically sat around and watched really, really miserably terrible movies. The whole weekend I just laid in bed. I mean, occasionally I'd get up and run one errand and sit back down. Like - not terribly tired, as in sleeping, but just sort of frazzled. 
And - I, I was quite concerned. I had - had no desire to go to work. I had - I was frightened of the people I was around.  It was all I could do to sort of pull myself up to talk about it. [0:02:30.3]
COUNSELOR: Frightened of people, like how? Like what?
PATIENT: Well - one of the worst cases of that was Friday night. I was even scared to go to a synagogue for Friday evening services. And - just - really scared, talking about it. Like, there was a point at which I - met - I, I met people after the service. And I just -. Like the rabbi usually comes over and sort of shakes hands you know. 
COUNSELOR: Sure.
PATIENT: It was just like I - I'm sure I was sending him strange signals. But he would - I didn't want him to touch me anymore and - come near me anymore. And, you know, it's usual we have [schnazel meeting] (ph) and, and -. A girl came up to me afterwards. And thank God, it was just all I could do to sort of -
COUNSELOR: These were people you knew? The rabbi knew - 
PATIENT: The rabbi I knew. The girl I had met once before. But - otherwise it was mostly people in the synagogue, and you -. The first reaction was not to flee.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: Um -.
COUNSELOR: And that's what you felt like doing?
PATIENT: Yeah. Usually I'm not real comfortable about hanging around, anyway. But this time I was - exquisitely -. I, in fact, even started the prayer. And just the process itself was - I was quite removed from it. It was not like -.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: At all. And -.
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) No, it doesn't sound like it. It sounds very upsetting.
PATIENT: Well I, I - it got to the point where - you know, I mean I - I sort of felt like just checking into some psych unit somewhere and being pulled off the civil society [less than] (ph) - you know - 
COUNSELOR: Ooh. Were you worried that you might do something? Or - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) No. I just didn't give - give a damn about anything. And I didn't want to be with anybody or seeing anybody. 
COUNSELOR: Let me ask you, I guess, what seems to me the obvious question. Maybe you've thought about this; I don't know. Wh - what might account for such experiences? I mean -
PATIENT: Well - 
(cross talking)
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: Such feelings.
PATIENT: This brings up issue number two, which is that -. Well, the obvious things are - is exhaustion. At least that's the obvious answer. And - 
(loud background noise - scraping?)
PATIENT: Yeah. 
(pause, 6 seconds)
PATIENT: I mean, I have vi - and I had visited my mother, this weekend so I can't -. I returned to go - go, go right back to work. And I was still - sort of in withdrawal from Cynthia. And - very - again, very (beginnings) (ph) at work as well as the (room.) (ph) [0:05:20.2]
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: And - but I feel like what -. And - I mean, I feel like what really pushed me over the edge was - was - was contact with you on Thursday. Whether, um, I - I mean, actually it was just so -. The more I started processing last week, and I got started getting pretty pissed at you. 
I thought it was more than a little gracious, and that's acknowledging what had taken place in the past months. And I was trying to - forthcoming and - stuff like that. And I felt it was just - freshman error or stupid or mean or - incredibly uninformative of you to - sort of - go after me towards the second, third. This thing where you started asking me about - "Well you sound like you still have a little bit of reservation." You never - you wouldn't accept it on face value. And - and it was tough for me to come in here and acknowledge that it was an act that was a sign of -. I thought it was a show of good faith on my part. And I basically felt rebuffed. And - and - and it just -. I, I got - and I - and I'll tell you what. [0:06:54.1]
One thing I did on Sunday night was to type up a letter of resignation from this program. And - and I - I didn't know what I needed, but I knew it wasn't this. And - and I - it was - not the most eloquent thing I've ever written. And I thought about - really what was right here, what would - I mean, it really just forced me to think about what - what should happen.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: And - and I thought the first thing I should do is - indicate two things. I thought of this one thing I should - not just throw it in and send the letter cold. And there were - there were - we did have - our infamous intermediary, (Maria.) (sp?) (Inference,) (ph) because we discussed (inference) (ph) on the other contexts last week.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: And - and that - despite the complexity of - of my approaching her, you know, with its obvious implication of good cop - good therapist, bad therapist or good cop, bad cop. I still felt like it was - I should just call and - and say that I, I was really in trouble. If nothing else, I mostly just needed to indicate that I - I really -. As of Monday, I was pretty well ready to go and get some blood tests or ECT or you name it. I didn't care what. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: I needed to be pulled out of place. And I didn't - I didn't give a rat's ass what happened to this program. And - and I just wanted to make it real clear that - I mean, you have been a very conscientious fellow. But - but, no, enough's enough. I don't want to be - you know, I'll be the monkey and you're all [brock and shit] (ph), but only up to a point. And - [0:08:56.9].
COUNSELOR: So did you talk to Maria? 
PATIENT: Yeah I did.
COUNSELOR: OK.
PATIENT: And she - I mean, I -. By Tuesday, she - she didn't get back to me until Tuesday. And by Tuesday, I was starting to feel my ambivalence again. And - and also had -. One of the reasons I didn't want to send the letter off was that I thought, basically, that one of the problems that I had in general was not confronting even bigger issues. I mean, I've been whining about this process since February. But in a way, whining is really a good way of characterizing it. And I haven't really just sort of confronted you in sub - substantive terms. It's all been about theory. And if you are (extents) (ph), we should compile this paradigm. (0:09:41.1).
COUNSELOR: Um. 
PATIENT: Or - like something like that.
COUNSELOR: Right. And - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: And it's kind of what - if I remember, that's kind of - this, the second part of the session that bothered you, that's kind of what that was about. Or you felt that that's what I was defending, "the mull", I think was what we called it then.
PATIENT: Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Can I stop for just a second? Just stop you for a second?
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: We can pick - right up here. But I - I wanted to ask you if this - this - this discussing this, or - or needing some [tea talk] (ph). It just feels very - tense to me.
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: Tense for you, too?
PATIENT: Yeah. There's - there's fairly serious accusations taking place here.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. And - And I feel - like I actually feel anxiety.
PATIENT: I guess so. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: I'm - I mean, I'm not happy with you. And - I'm not happy with what took place here. And - and I'm telling you straight out.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. You know - and [I want to say] (ph) I'm glad you can own up [you are] (ph) anxious. I'm glad that you're telling me. It is taking you somewhat by surprise. Now - not in the sense that I - I couldn't imagine such a thing [in that.] Because I did know that - there was conflict in the last session. And I did know that you thought that I hadn't taken the best approach the second part of it. And you disagreed with what I was saying. And so forth. But I didn't - I didn't realize how strong your reaction was. [0:11:23.7]
(pause)
PATIENT: Yeah, no doubt. Well, that's part of -. Part of what I do, I think, is when the stakes get higher, I will often - I often will - the more mad I get, probably the more - the better I am in covering it up.
COUNSELOR: You cover it up.
PATIENT: And - 
COUNSELOR: I knew you were mad. But - 
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: But to - to have the reaction that you described on Friday and over the weekend - 
PATIENT: Well - now there's a difference between you being - the full cause of something, and you being the last straw.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: OK? And - and surely, I've been clear about the presence of my breakup with Cynthia. 
COUNSELOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And I don't know if I've been clear about the decreasing security I have at work. 
COUNSELOR: Yes, you have talked about that. And - also you changing your living situation.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: So there's some - yes.
PATIENT: So - 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you're right. I didn't mean to imply that - that was the - the full cause. 
PATIENT: But nonetheless, if anybody had - should have had sort of a heads up on this -. 
(pause, 6 seconds)
PATIENT: Yeah. I mean, I - well. 
(pause, 20 seconds)
PATIENT: I guess my - my reaction, then. I don't know whether to be surprised. [0:13:20.5]
COUNSELOR: Like I say, I'm surprised about how strong - I didn't know your reaction was this strong. As you come in now and tell me about it. And - you know, you're kind of saying things - in a straight way, in a two - two-point way. In a way that - that surprised me, the way you describe your reaction, that - that you thought was a real freshman move, as you said. And - and that you would - had sat down and written that letter to basically end the therapy.
PATIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: In our session last week, I knew we had a disagreement. I knew you thought I had gone the wrong way. But I, I - I certainly did not think that your reaction was that strong, you know. I didn't think - when you left last Thursday, that -. It - it never occurred to me that you would be writing - that letter over the weekend.
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: You know?
PATIENT: Well I think that -. (sighs) I don't know how to say this, except that I feel like in more ways - despite -. I - I think that what's been happening is that I've been tiptoeing (around) (ph) you. And - and - hard as that may be to believe, and as critical as I've often been, and sort of snide, and stuff like that, I - I basically think that on many occasions I have sort of - treated you -. I haven't treated you as fully as I have experienced you. And - [0:15:23.3]
COUNSELOR: You've pulled your punches, you might say? Or you - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Yeah. Well let, let - let me get right to the point here. I think that - I can remember in the first sessions that we had, your age came up rather quickly. And - and you actually presented it in a way of - almost sort of a - a preparatory. You know, like is this going to be a problem? Or, or - or almost -. You were kind of heading this off at the pass kind of thing, dealing with it up front. But in a way, innoc - inoculating me against really having a claim against it, or something like that.
I - I knew you were aware of it. And I knew - and I actually got the sense that you were a little bit uncomfortable about it. And so in [our ways] (ph) I basically feel like I've -. When this hasn't gone well, I feel like I've tried to make excuses for it. And - somebody who's young and is - and I don't know, who [acts in really clinical] (ph) years of experience. Which is - you know. [Acts like] (ph) there's [too greater and less than other and -] (ph) whatever. [I need you to] (ph) - you know. It's just like, well - you know, [let that - ] (ph) do the best you can with it. And stuff like that. But - really feeling that it was beyond the commentary comment, or something like that. I just have to take it. [0:16:43.8]
Now - there was a couple of times, you know. I mean, there have been many times when I just - that, basically, you know. If I'm - you know, whenever I've felt like -. 
(pause, 7 seconds)
When I've felt like the drinking was a problem, or my relationship with Cynthia was (falling) (ph) deeper into the toilet than I could ever believe it. And I couldn't bring it up with you. I just lived with it.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: And - and I even remember once - and actually, this really sticks with me - when I brought up the drinking with you. And your advice was something like, "Well you be careful about that." It was like, "Oh thanks, Uncle (Jim)." You know, I mean it was really pedestrian. And I just - do you have any idea what I am (biting) (ph) here? You know? I mean, this is your advice? I mean, can't you just read Psychology Today first, or something? I mean - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: You know, it just seemed like - I, I don't get to think about this all day long. And you do. And you get - I mean - the things that I think about all day long I can offer good advice for, even if they're not directly related to my field. You know, it's like - it's like, this is what I'm stuck with? I mean, this is like, "Don't drink." ? "Just say No." ? And - and that's like - What's that? And I didn't say anything. I mean, I thought it at the time. Like - some answer. You know, like - yeah. OK. I'll just look at the bottle and say, "No." 
I - I just - and it's just -. I mean, I - not just sort of belittle the whole - the whole spring. But there have been times when I feel like I've - just really [checked on top of me] (ph) in a way that I should never have. And, you know. So that makes the day really icky, you know. Because now you're getting all these - all this baggage. [0:18:47.1]
COUNSELOR: Um.
PATIENT: You know. Now that's - on one hand, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. And on the other hand, you know, that's the way it is. You know, I - I think that the real - let me just finish this sentence. The real hard part for me was feeling, for maybe three or four minutes last week, like you were one of my grad students. And man, that sucked. I hated that. I mean, it's like, "OK, fine. I mean, if you - if you - if you want to give me stuff to read [over the palm] (ph), I'll read - I'll read your stuff." You know. But obv - no, not obviously, that's not it. But - I don't come here for that. I don't come here for that.
COUNSELOR: Hm.
PATIENT: OK? And - and I don't come here for truisms. And I don't come here for - for [starting to be] (ph) nervous because we deviated one foot outside the (paradigm.) (ph) You know. And - 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: And for - and me to adopt your (nervousness.) (ph) For us both to sit here and go, "Oh my God! We've lost the paradigm." You know, "I sure hope Dad doesn't get us, you know, come down here and spank us both." 
You know, it's like I'm not here for that. I don't give a fuck anymore. You know? I mean, fuck the paradigm. I - I mean, I - you know, if it works, it works. If it helps me, it helps me. But I - I'm not - I mean, I'm just not going to play this thing anymore. I mean, there might still be merit in doing it and approaching our relationship in this way. But - I'm not going to sit around here and play ping-pong, you know, and not give weight to these other things.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: I - I need to ask a question.
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: Um - (pause). This is a question similar to what I asked you before about other things. But - with this, all this is coming in [pounds bagged] (ph) up to - to now. Why now? Why - why is this? Why tell me about this now? [0:20:43.6]
PATIENT: This is an interesting thing that you do. I tell you why, and then you ask me why again. I told you why. I - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Because - 
PATIENT: Because of last Thursday.
COUNSELOR: Because of last Thursday. OK.
(crosstalking) 
PATIENT: And now you're asking why again. Why do you ask?
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Well let's - well let's talk about that, then. Let's talk about last Thursday. Because I think - that's what I was wondering, if it was last Thursday. OK? But rather than me saying - that, I - I want us to - just look at that. Just to explore that. Because - because as you say, it seems to have been a - a precipitant of this.
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: But I'm not sure I have a full picture of how that happened.
(pause, 8 seconds)
PATIENT: OK. Well -. To retrace our - our steps from my perspective, it was - we had a Tuesday meeting in which - 
COUNSELOR: Excuse me.
PATIENT: I sort of caught up. I handed in my forms. I had started to approach - you know, I was sort of ready to give up; but on the other hand, there was this lingering sense that there had been some benefit. And then our Thursday meeting, I went ahead and - you know, sort of took the leap of faith; and yes, OK, I am going to go ahead and see this through. Which, for me, was a big deal. [0:22:22.5]
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: You know? You're - you're not going to be around. You - you violate any of the norms that I hold near and dear, you know, for long-term relationships. For - you know, not investing and consider it fly-by-night. Or - not that it's fly-by-night, but - 
COUNSELOR: But it's limited.
PATIENT: But it is limited.
COUNSELOR: It's 30 times
.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: And that's the end. Right. 
PATIENT: And I felt in myself that - wherever you are, [you won't have to be eating] (ph) somewhere. So - so I was willing to go ahead and just, you know, throw - throw in my - what, what few remaining acts of good faith, you know, that I could. I mean, maybe I've been grumpy from sessions 1 to 17 or whatever it is. And grumpy and withholding from 1 to 17, I was willing to sort of step forward and put my - you know, put my goodwill in, [quit all the grieving,] (ph) and (plow) (ph) 13, whatever. [0:23:31.9]
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: And for my troubles, I got - a real strange session out of you. And - and it's - and -. And that, to me, just felt - like -. First of all, like the - I mean, at the very least it negated - . I mean, it's - it's just - it negated your credibility as far as I was concerned. You know, I mean it just - basically, your - your sort of giggling - you know, assertion that how of course wasn't it cute that I was the therapist for a few minutes. You know. You remember saying that?
COUNSELOR: No, I don't quite remember saying wasn't it cute that you were the therapist. 
PATIENT: Wow. Um - 
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) But I do remember saying that yes, I thought there - 
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: Right. I - you said that - I took that to mean -. Well actually I think what you said was - 
(pause, 8 seconds) 
"Wasn't that fun?" or - "Did you like that?'. Or something like that. Like - like, "I let you play therapist for awhile, isn't that neat?" Like it was - like you were sure having fun. And you let me play with - you would let me steer the car for awhile. Basically I was the kid in the back seat, and then I got to steer the car. You know.
COUNSELOR: Well.
PATIENT: And - and I - I felt that that was -. What that indicated to me was basically that -. That really put me in a weird (place.) (ph) Your head's in the wrong place here. ] 0:25:32.7]
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: I mean - 
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: [I know] (ph) what you're doing is playing, and - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Well actually as you say it that way, it sounds very condescending or joking or making light of the whole practice. For me - for me to have said it to you that way. When you repeat it. And - I certainly did not intend any of it to come that way. In fact - just to let you know where - what I was thinking more at that time was that - not that I didn't let you play there with so much as you had taken much more.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:26:09.0)
COUNSELOR: You had seen me falling down on the job, almost. That I stumbled. That I was doing something out of my own motivations rather than in your best interest as a patient. And you - in pointing that out - took a (role) (ph) that was much more like what I'm supposed have. That was - 
PATIENT: And I think what you said was something like, "How did I feel?". 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Because that seemed to me -. And the reason why I pointed that out was, that seemed to me to be a big - a big shift that happened quite suddenly. It happened - I don't think coincidentally - after you had had a moment of - not a moment, some time - of telling me something that was very uncomfortable for you to talk about. It took a - a - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) You're saying, somehow I brought this on myself? 
COUNSELOR: No, no. It's not bringing it on yourself. I'm just saying that - that that was - that's what seemed to me to be the sequence. And I wasn't sure why that happened. And that's why I was curious about it.
(pause, 9 seconds) 
I don't know if you know this, but oftentimes in here - it's not that I have this clear, grand formulation of exactly what's happening. But something strikes me, and I say, "Harry, what do you think of this? I notice this. Let's see if we, together, can -." Kind of like what we are doing now. "Let's see if we can get - together can explore this." 
And that's kind of where I was coming from with that. I didn't have some idea like - "Oh - [think about it.] (ph) [0:27:50.2]
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: You weren't saying - you were actually saying, "What do you think of that?" rather than - rather than I was sort of a drinking buddy sort of, like, "Ah, what do you think of that, eh?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which is the other - which is, I think, one, two [for all of this] (ph) grumbling about. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know, but as - I can't - I don't remember. But as you say, I might have taken - let's say, too playful an attitude, you know. Or an attitude - you picked up on something that I was doing that made it like I was making light, or I wasn't taking this whole thing as seriously.
PATIENT: There was a mirthful time in the sense that you (inaudible at 0:28:34.7).
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: And - I thought it was [the wrong] (ph) principle.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Maybe there was. What I'm saying is, I didn't intend it that way. But - I, I don't know. Perhaps that was my own - my own discomfort.
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: You calling me on something.
PATIENT: Um hm. 
COUNSELOR: Mm?
(pause, 12 seconds)
Do you - but - but then - you had a very strong reaction to that.
PATIENT: Um hm. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And that must have been - I mean, particularly after what you had told me in the beginning. As you said, you came in - how did you put it earlier in today's session? You said - something about giving your best effort, or in - in the -
PATIENT: Good faith attempt to - 
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Yeah. Yeah. Right. Good faith attempt. To be frank and straight with me about things and to talk about stuff that had been on your mind that had been difficult to talk about then, and - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Well, not to the level of difficulty so much as it was my stepping forward and - and acknowledging what - what's happening here, what's important and valid. And then basically at - 
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Right.
PATIENT: At the very moment that I do this - 
COUNSELOR: I invalidate it. [0:30:06.3]
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: I - well I was insensitive to it. 
PATIENT: Well you certainly took a strange tack on it, that's for sure. I mean - I - I do not understand why you did that. I can't - I can't believe why you didn't pick up on - you know, why there wasn't sort of a gracious thanks and moving on, or something like that. And - but you got into this other fucking stupid - train. You know, like, well wait a minute. I don't like the choice of adverbs you used, you know. OK?
COUNSELOR: I tell you - you know, I wish - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Um hm.
COUNSELOR: I - now as we're talking about it, I almost wish I could say, "It was a mistake. And let's move on." But I know I can't.
PATIENT: I agree it was a mistake. I don't know if we could move on. Or I, at least, believe it was a mistake. I don't know. But you're saying that -. I - I do -
(pause, 6 seconds) 
OK. Well you don't have to be perfect. And - and - you don't even have to be, you know, to be sort of perfect. But you can't be stupid, either. You know, you can't make really stupid errors a lot. And - 
COUNSELOR: Well it was stupid, and it was insensitive, I guess. [0:31:32.4]
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: Well - I think what gets me - and this is what I - this is really where my conflict with you is right now - is that I -. You know, I've given you some very - pretty big fucking alert signals here about what's going on this spring. And - and - and the drinking is -. You know, I don't give a shit about this paradigm or whatever it is that you're using. Somebody tells you about a drinking problem - you know, I have -. You - you owe it to them to talk about this. In the same way as I - if somebody tells me about a failed foundation, you know, and - I mean, this is not something you take lightly. This is not something you, "Hey, [you gotta be] (ph) watch out. You know, you'd better get your basement pumped out next rain." You know.
I mean, what do you - what is that? I mean - I mean, this is just - this is - this is - this is no game. 
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: This is not -. They're playing for keeps out there. I - you know, you can't, like, have it your way in here. And, and - and Cynthia is the same way. There's a deeply fucked up relationship that was having material impacts all the way. And - and at the end of one of my sessions, you're like, "Isn't it - isn't it interesting that that's what happening out there?" It's happening in here.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: Now great. Clinical insight. You know, that's just what I need right now. And - and - and it - I, I -. On the one hand it was an interesting comment. On the other hand, I - I don't know that we got down to the fact this was really fucking problematic for me.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. 
PATIENT: And - I - it's like, I don't think you get it. That - or at least I - well. I'll just leave it at that. I don't think you get it, or I don't think you got it. It seems to be in the past tense. And it may not be something that you're - this method that you've been working on or developed or whatever, can address. But it certainly can get more serious. Or these other issues can certainly get more serious attention or more serious integration into this process than we've been giving it. And that's how I feel, (bummed) (ph) on. And that's why I feel ready to just - just say, "Fuck this whole thing." [0:33:51.0]
Not that I don't need the help. It - not that I don't need help. I just don't need this. And - 
COUNSELOR: I - I have - really have to ask a question here.
PATIENT: Go for it.
COUNSELOR: Because you're telling me all this, and it seems to me - correct me if I'm wrong, but I felt we discussed this two sessions ago. And it was our agreement that I was - changing my tact about that and was actually interested in hearing more about that.
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: Because you had wanted to talk about it so much for so long. And you're right. It - it wasn't - it was like, disallowed or something.
PATIENT: Um hm. 
COUNSELOR: And - and you had come to me a number of times and said, "Let's - this is ridiculous. Because this is bothering me, and you're not letting me talk about it."
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: And because of that, we - I, I think we're going to allow more room for it. So - so what's happening now? You know?
PATIENT: Well, I - I think this is what - you know, I - I mean, on the one hand you s - you can say those words, and you can make that commitment. But then to follow it up with sort of repetitive behavior, or - or to repeat the behavior of kind of blocking [end tudes] (ph) and micro issues of, you know, my adverbs or adjectives with respect to, you know, my devotion to - you know, like I - I still heard some (reservation) (ph) here. [0:35:14.4]
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 
PATIENT: You know. And it's like, oh give me a break. We're going to spend ten minutes on this? On the - on the last 1 percent of my devotion to your model? You know? I - I mean, it - that seemed to me -
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: To say, "Yeah, sure. We're - yeah, there's been a lot of change here." And - and OK. It's unfair, perhaps, I think two things. One is, I'm probably being overly harsh because I do not bring forth my frus - the level of my frustration with you before I extract a concession from you. I do feel like I have to extract those concessions. I think I drug you kicking and screaming [in that] (ph) I had to - I had to basically be at my (bris) (ph) before you decided to change. 
OK. So - I want - so, two things. So two things. I didn't speak up - didn't speak up clearly enough, or - and - and, and somehow when it finally did get addressed, it kind of got addressed in a very -. I had to engage in brinksmanship, which is - you know, miserable. And - you know, like you - you either change, or I leave. You know? And - but you turned that on its head. "Well, it's time for the mid time evaluation, anyway. We can do this -." And it - it was - was almost like - what was really -. The real reason, or one - one way out of this where you can save face is call a mid - a mid course fraction. You know? You know?
COUNSELOR: OK.
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: It's not really that there's a problem here. It's that - all - all sessions - at the end of the 15th session, you know, the Constitution of Beth Israel Medical Center says that you can change your mind. You know, or something like that. Well fuck that. And - and you know, it just - it doesn't make any sense. I don't care. That's [why I say] (ph) I'm in a total patients' rights mode right now. (chuckles) You know? [0:37:15.8]
COUNSELOR: So let me see if I understand what you're saying. You seem to be saying that even with - you and I decided that - we would talk more about these things that are bothering you in your life. It seemed, number one, kind of like a concession and kind of like something, in fact, that I was even covering over. But I wasn't saying, "Yeah, we're doing this because it's important enough to you, and it is bothering you enough," but more like I made a reason for it.
PATIENT: Yeah. That's right. That - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: That - that would make it seem legitimate.
PATIENT: You're not leaning over and saying, "You know what? I hear you. Your life's in the toilet. Let's take care of this now." What I heard was, "Wow. It's the fifteenth session. Let's change."
COUNSELOR: And you took that as - maybe that was something that was part of the model, or I was making you part of the model, or something like that.
PATIENT: Yeah. That's something like that.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: So ra - so rather than, in fact, it being me responding to these concerns that you've brought in time and time again, and finally saying, "Harry, you're right. This is bothering you enough. I think we should talk about it.", I made up some little - I, I - I kind of finessed the whole thing into something where it looked like, "Oh yeah! OK. Well let's - let's do this reevaluation. "
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: (interrupts) That's exactly right. 
COUNSELOR: I see. I see. And then - and then when you came in to subsequent sessions, and I continued pointing out things I usually do and talking like I usually do, it might have seemed that even that concession, that I wasn't genuine about following through with it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That I was - 
PATIENT: Right on.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Pulling your chain. 
PATIENT: And you - 
COUNSELOR: Pulling your chest - pulling your leg. Something like that.
PATIENT: You had made - 
COUNSELOR: You were pulling your chain, too.
PATIENT: I think it was that basically - you were staying within - within the rigid confines of your little world, still. You were - you were sort of staying in your little bubble. And - you know. Basically still - stuck (chuckles), you know. [0:39:35.0]
Imagine me. I - I, I get busted in - in session ten for - for using theory too much. But the real theorist here is you, right? You know, it's like - like, who's - who's really a - who's - 
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Well I agree.
PATIENT: I can only hang on -
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: I got busted last week, OK? (laughs)
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: Right. Right. [What happened then.] (ph) And I understand what you're saying.
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: Well. And so basically, yeah. Well I think basically it just became starkly clear to me that - that, that - that what you really do care about - or at least -
(pause)
I - I mean, I - I don't want to hurt your feelings, (Sean) (sp?), but I really do feel like -. Basically - basically you're incredibly focused on this model of whatever it is that you are doing. And - that - and even a less funny way, I really could come in here on fire; and you would fucking stay in your model. You wouldn't get a fire extinguisher. You'd - 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: You - your notebook, or - or something. I don't know what. But - and, you know, I -. You know, shame on me for not having the guts or (being) (ph) having some misplaced sense of - you know, be nice to the new guy. [He gave -. ] (ph) You know, shame on me for being silent up until now - and saying these things and coming out with you with all this vitriol, which is admittedly coming out with what I feel, I guess, [to you.] (ph) But on the other hand, you know, shame on you for - you know, being devoted to textbooks or something like that. I - I mean -. [0:41:18.1]
COUNSELOR: Well, look. Let - let me be honest with you. 
PATIENT: Sounds (good.) (ph) 
COUNSELOR: This - this - (laughs). Thi - this is actually not -. This is the model of therapy that we're in. But it's not about - the model. This therapy is about helping you. That's the goal of this therapy. And my sticking to the model - as I think I've said to you before - but - I don't know. Maybe you don't believe me. But it's (chuckles) - is that I do think that this is the best way to be helpful for you. 
You know? At the same time, I do think there were two things that - there were things that - perhaps it was me in my application of the model, much less than the model or the theory itself. About [to you] (ph) wanting to talk about these things and so on and so forth. That - that wasn't happening. I wasn't letting it happen. Right?
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: And - yeah. I mean - that's where my thinking was with it when I was thinking of changing it.
PATIENT: Um hm.
COUNSELOR: You know? 
PATIENT: Well - I'm glad that - you know, that - the goal here is helping patients or of helping people, or whatever. And - and - I, I agree. Or at least my sense of what's happened is that your thinking was more kind of - (really) (ph) a more ethereal world; or at least an emphasis was there that needed to be elsewhere.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that this is, you know -. I mean, I'll agree; this is a [money field,] (ph), this kind of stuff. But - if I never hear the "M" word again, meaning "model", I would - it would be too soon.
COUNSELOR: (laughs) I'm sorry. It's just that I thought a different -. When you first said that, I thought you were thinking "mindfulness." But - 
PATIENT: Completely your word.
COUNSELOR: (laughs) Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't want to hear any of that shit anymore.
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: I won't say it, and I don't want to hear it. You know, I mean -. As far as I'm concerned, I - I'm not in full agreement with you. It's a bunch of bullshit. I know. It has nothing to do with sensuous human activity to youth. Marx's term was "sensuous human interaction." Or whatever you want to call it. I don't think that - enough talk. You know, enough talk. That's all I need to say. You know, let's interact. Let's - you know - you know, let's quit playing patient and therapist and - and - you know, let's - whatever. I, or - at least that's my preference. I don't want to hear that stuff again. [0:43:57.6]
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: I don't want to hear that ever again.
COUNSELOR: Talking about the - the model - 
PATIENT: (interrupts, shouts) Don't! Yeah - exactly.
COUNSELOR: Explicitly.
PATIENT: Well -. Do it. Don't tell me about it.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: And - I find it confusing. I find it distracting. And I find it - frankly, is I don't think -. The more I think about it, it has no place in this - in this setting. You can do whatever. Whatever informs you as you walk the door, fine. Let it inform you. But it - but it cert - it's not my rule. I don't care what - I don't care. I don't care about it. You know, it's - I just don't.
COUNSELOR: That's - that's fine, actually. Because, you know - the whole point in talking about that - the "M" word - is, in fact, actually, that you're aware of the point of this. And so that we can collaborate - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) So it sort of pulls us (quadrant) (ph) - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Exactly. Exactly.
PATIENT: How?
COUNSELOR: But it shouldn't be that the goal is that the therapy becomes about talking about the model and virtues of the model or the downfalls of the model and all that. It's not supposed to be a debate about that. You know? It's not. And it's also not supposed to be a lesson about, "This is a good model," or "Look how the model applied to your life in this place."
(background noise - ruler slapping on desk?)
That's not what it's supposed to be about, (either.) (ph) [0:45:08.2]
PATIENT: Well. You could have fooled me last week, when we planned that we - 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Um - 
COUNSELOR: Apparently I could have. That's why I wanted to say that. Because -. Last week, I - I'm not - I, I -. I'm struggling - I've been struggling this whole time with whether or not to say this. Because - on the one hand, I think, this is personally motivated; and I feel like I'm defending myself from what I did last week. I - I want to tell you that, that -. But also, I do - I do feel at the same time - a legitimate, that it's - it's legitimate to let you know what I was thinking and why I brought that up last week. And there's nothing - there is nothing really so - it's very simple. The fact of the matter is - it's that - I think - you have a certain attitude towards this therapy. And it's one that has been marked with ambivalence from the beginning. That you're not sure this is the thing for you. And it's come up in various ways.
And - you know, that's not just an attitude towards the therapy. That's part of it. That informs the process. And that - 
PATIENT: What does that mean? [0:46:20.6]
COUNSELOR: Well - again, it's not that I have a clear idea of - particular ways in which I might -. But let's just say, you coming in, and you with certain expectations, and you wanting to talk about certain things, and knowing that there's this model, and having mixed feelings about it - how can that not come in here? 
And so, when you said something that I thought was kind of reflecting the - part of that attitude, that's why I want to point it out. That's it. It was like, exploration about - around your feelings about the therapy. And that's what I was trying to do. And - perhaps I - perhaps our mistake was in how I did that. Or in pursuing it too much. I - I don't know. But I - I'm telling you this just so you know what I was thinking. Where I was coming from. I don't -.
PATIENT: It's a better - OK. I appreciate that. It's - it's better that we have an alternate than to think that you were giggling about getting to play therapist every day. And - wasn't it cute that I got to do it? [That was -] (ph) 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: It's a - less hideous explanation. [0:47:45.9]
COUNSELOR: Yeah. That is a pretty hideous explanation, isn't it? 
PATIENT: I don't think it's implausible. 
(pause, 5 seconds) 
COUNSELOR: I imagine that that explanation would be particularly hidi - hideous after what had come up early in that session. 
PATIENT: Well that's exactly -. Exactly. I mean, the fact that I was - [let's see.] (ph) Yeah, I mean, I started off the session with, "You win." And - 
COUNSELOR: Not just, "You win."
PATIENT: And I - then I, I hadn't even brought it up - say, say, " you win." 
(inaudible at 0:48:31.9) Two kids fighting on the ground.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: Um -
COUNSELOR: You know something, Harry? I - don't know if you know this, but - the first half of last session, you looked that you were - you looked different to me than you usually do. And - when we were talking about that, and your different feelings and reactions. You know, we're talking about them, and you (showing) (ph) all of that. You know, you had said it was kind of like a secret, or something. But it was - it was vulnerable. 
PATIENT: (OK.) (ph) 
COUNSELOR: And it was hard to talk about.
PATIENT: I agree. I - I was - I came in, and I said it at the very beginning. I - I'll fight. OK? Fine. Let's - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: That's - you know? You don't have to marry me. You don't have to have 60 sessions with me. (Yet -) (ph) I said over my 30 point co-sessions. And we'll shake hands and call it even. No problem. And - and - I started [hitting hard] (ph). And - I mean, I didn't consciously start with, "Any time you're ready?" [I never had] (ph) any intention of [showing up?] (ph) [0:49:40.0]
But - it came up, and I was just going to experiment.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. And you played, in good faith, as you said. And then I went - 
PATIENT: Right.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: And changed -. And I didn't play fair, or something.
PATIENT: Well - yeah. Whatever it was, it was weird. And - you know, like - and yeah. I mean, I just - 
(pause)
Like I said, it seems like there's -. I mean, I don't want to be cruel. I'm just sort of, you know, rub your face in it or anything. And that - and because there are a lot factors which play into this. I mean, I was saving stamps. I was pulling punches all spring long. And you know, I - the - the anger that I have felt this past week would not be there had it not been for my own (cream) (ph) system condition or tendency to not mention things. And to sort of - and - baby people and pat [them, "I understand fully."] (ph) [0:50:43.8]
And if I - you know, I mean, I had told you that? [You'd done] (ph) all the (talking.) (ph) So I - I - I do have to acknowledge my boldness. [That worked.] (ph) It was - you know, it wasn't like you did the most hideous unspeakable thing in the world. There was lots of conditions - sort of feeding into this moment. I just - I mean, there was some sense that -. Like, cars don't have accidents until there are people speeding and they are ignoring things. And - I mean, I don't mean - (never,) (ph) but -.
So I acknowledge my - my role in this. You know, and - and I mean like - I'm trying. I'm -. I'm actually trying not to - sort of - you know - make it all OK. I mean, sort of patch over [what I can say or whatever.] (ph) Because I think I do that; I've done that too much. But at the same time, I will - I have to acknowledge this (time) (ph) because it's a - straight fact that - OK, I did contribute to this by not being more straightforward. And it was the reason that I didn't drop off the letter on Tuesday and say, "Screw all this." Because I do feel like - to your credit, what I need to do is be - I need to be more mindful. And more up front. I mean, just say it. I need to come here and say it. And to - get off my wet ass and - and - and, you know, (reanalyze) (ph) the cute, mirthful first half of last hour. So - I guess that means that - you know, speaking - get the - you know, the - the glittery fun things. And we also have darker and hard things, too, I guess. [0:52:39.1]
So - I mean, you're - you're still the winner in this. I - I'm here getting angry with you, and I wouldn't had you not taught me to. (chuckles). By the same token, it's ironic that it was your own - your own hand that (laughs) - sort of pulled the trigger. So I - I mean, I - I'm not in a very - I'm not in the mood to sort of give you tons of kudos right now. But I will say that you've got some coming. I mean, it's true. I wouldn't be here, and you're not sort of showing me lots of things about how deeply this stuff, this - this talking needs to take place or be (here) (ph) or something like that. It's just that - it's just that [I'm psycho.] (ph) [0:53:28.1]
(background noise - something slapped against table?)
PATIENT: It's - you know. I mean - I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't be here. This very act of confronting you is your advice coming back. 
COUNSELOR: You mean - 
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: I still trust you. I - I, I guess that I'm saying is just - (sighs). You've made it hard. 
COUNSELOR: You think it would be fair to say that this is the angriest you've been?
PATIENT: Yeah. Absolutely.
COUNSELOR: And now that you've done that - how does that feel?
PATIENT: Like I said, I'm not - in a very forgiving mood right now. I'm still angry. It's very difficult to come forward. I - I -.
COUNSELOR: And you - But you came in here anticipating telling me all this. You knew.
PATIENT: Well - I didn't have any script. I honestly didn't. I was just going to tell you I had a shitty week.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: And - I didn't have a script [or it written down.] (ph) I just knew that what I was going to do was - 
(background noise - electronic alarm?) 
PATIENT: Be a lot more straightforward and let out my frustration in here and - and that I [was never going to treat you (inaudible)] (ph) And - you know? And - I - I'm glad, I feel -. How does it feel? I'm still angry. I feel slightly glad to have it behind me. I'm wondering how it will feel to see you again, or whether we'll just - you know, sort of walk around and - probably the next 11 sessions [or more out of here.] (ph) And a little discomfortable - uncomfortable interaction. [0:55:13.3]
So I'm wondering that, and - what else? I believe that's kind of it.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. It's possible that your being angry, it's not something that we're done talking about. Right? Maybe - you're glad that you were able to talk about it this time. But as you say, you're still angry. And maybe - maybe - maybe you're going to want to talk about it more.
PATIENT: Maybe. Like I said, I acknowledge my role in this. But - (sighs). I think what - I think what will piss me off more than anything else - I don't think my anger hangs around. I just came in. I mean, I don't see it hanging around for a really long time. But - what will piss me off is that - what precipitated it continues to take place. That, I'm sure. I mean, if - if we -. I mean - the things we said that we would do, do have to happen. I mean, if I'm in trouble, I'm not going to fucking listen to - like, "Well that's very interesting" or "We're (winging) (ph) it."
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: Or listen to you ignore me. You know, I'll say something, and you'll ignore it and bracket it and approach this another way. I mean, if that happens - I mean, not to threaten, but I can tell you that's - not a threat; it's just what's going to happen. That - if - if I'm having trouble, and I'm not - and I'm not getting some sort of - some sort of commentary upon it, even minimal - it's going to blow up. I'm going to blow up. [0:57:00.0]
COUNSELOR: You know, I wonder -. Yeah. I understand that. I wonder if - if it's the commentary as much as -. The way you - you know, you presented - you present it now - you presented the problem before. I kind of get the feeling that maybe - when you bring that stuff up, and I bracket it or whatever and talk about - something about how you're talking, or whatever - that it's like I'm changing the subject.
PATIENT: You are changing the subject. 
COUNSELOR: Right. In other words, it's not just the lack of commentary about it in terms of - you know. Maybe it's just that I'm not hearing what you're saying. I don't let you tell me about it. 
PATIENT: Well I feel like what you're doing is, you're training to hear something else. Or you're training to listen for something else. And - and so of course - of course you're hearing from it. But you're sitting there pre-programmed to - listen for this other thing, which - I don't know what it is. But I do know that you don't want to hear the first thing that I said, but more the way that I said it. And so you're going to comment on that. And then, you know - and we'll be into 20 minutes on that. And maybe the fact of this other thing, little that it is - like, you know -.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: (interrupts) Do -.
PATIENT: (interrupts) Alcoholism.
COUNSELOR: What little that is, that's it. That's it. It's that you feel - 
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: (interrupts) Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: It's that you feel I belittle your problem.
PATIENT: Exactly. 
COUNSELOR: I say, "Let's - let's put that aside, and let's talk about this other thing."
PATIENT: Yeah. And - it does - I think what really amazes me is that - is that -. Maybe this is - to reduce it to more practical terms -. You do it, you comment on the first sentence, if not the first half sentence.
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: You don't let three sentences go by. You won't even let four minutes go, or two minutes. One minute. You comment on the first, second sentence.
COUNSELOR: [Keep going.] (ph) 
PATIENT: And it's like, "Oh. Is that it?" I mean, "Is this it?" You know, "I heard the first note. [It's not that] (ph) he sucks." You know? What - what is that? I mean, surely there's a way for you to do what you do where I can get out - some sort of commentary, and then you can do this thing. I mean, at least that's my - at least that's - that's what I've come up with in the last minute. [0:59:27.1]
COUNSELOR: At least that way - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Is that what's most insulting is that I can't even get - I can't stand this first sentence. This first (big) (ph) going first shit. Because - because it's just like this game. I come out with one sentence, and it doesn't matter. It's just - it doesn't matter what that sentence is. You're just going to jump on how I said it. And - and, and - why don't you jump on how - how the dialogue - what the dialogue was for the first five minutes? Or something like that?
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: I mean, that seems just - to have just as much import as - as what came out in the first minute. Or - or whatever. I mean, it's just like you're overanxious.
COUNSELOR: Well import or not, when I jump on the first sentence, you don't have an opportunity to tell me what's on your mind.
PATIENT: No. And even when I - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: That's - and that's insulting.
PATIENT: And - well even when I (attempt) (ph) for it. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: Basically. And what you noticed was the begging. 
COUNSELOR: Hm. Yes. Well. It's about time to stop now. 
I have a question for you. 
(background noise - beads shaking?)
PATIENT: OK. 
COUNSELOR: Before we stop. Which is - about this drinking stuff. This is just something you can think about. One possibility is to - to get in touch with one of the AA groups around; there are 20. 
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: So - if you're interested in that, you let me know. OK? And I can help facilitate that, or I can give you numbers and so forth.
PATIENT: OK. First, two things. One is - that drinking is not a problem right now. I manage to do my own thing. The second (laughs) - 
COUNSELOR: (chuckles) OK.
PATIENT: The second thing is, trying to - you're going to have to do your research. AA is an alternative form of therapy. And - and it runs counter to this institution. This setup that you guys have is that I don't go into other forms of counseling. 
COUNSELOR: Oh. It - it - that's the research? You see, I'm - I'm not like a research -
PATIENT: The word is that you should not go to see other counselors. And -.
COUNSELOR: OK. Well I wasn't aware of that. [1:01:40.4]
PATIENT: And - I don't know what kinds of - I mean, I don't know - I mean, I don't know what -. If I had a patient who - if I was doing this with a patient, or if I had somebody sitting over there, I think that I would spend some time talking about what's happened and how much and when and why.
COUNSELOR: Um hm. Yeah. That - that -.
PATIENT: (interrupts) And you can - you can suspend your little - (regular) (ph) little thing for a day while you do some really (passionate) (ph) assessment, and what's leading up to it, and what are you thinking, or whatever.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: I - I don't want to give you the impression that - that would mean that we wouldn't talk about it here. But AA is still the treatment of choice for problems with alcohol use. And it -
PATIENT: (interrupts) Hopefully, [that is.] (ph) 
COUNSELOR: It is, actually. And -
PATIENT: OK. How much do you know about them? Have - have you been to one of these meetings?
COUNSELOR: No. I haven't. But it is - still, and even in hospitals they use the model based on AA quite often. There are other treatments available. And those would an option for you, too. But this was the one I wanted to mention first. And - if there weren't this arrangement that you don't have to be - that you can't be other forms of therapy, that's frequently what's - what is done when people are coming to therapy with us. [You're just -] (ph) [1:03:04.1]
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Problems with alcohol.
PATIENT: See, I have - I have - I have very big problems with this. Because I'm really surprised that you can't link what kinds of -. I'm surprised that you have to subcontract out my drinking problem to somebody else.
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Well - again.
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: I mean, you can't comment on it with your - I mean, I would think that you would have something to say about it based on what you know about it.
COUNSELOR: Well again, I want to be clear. That doesn't mean that it can't come in here.
PATIENT: OK. 
COUNSELOR: Right?
PATIENT: OK. [Fair enough.] (ph) 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But - but - but often that's done where - where it's - it's discussed in therapy, among other things. You know, let's say in your case, your relationship with Cynthia. 
(crosstalking)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And other things that - that you have that you want to talk about. And at the same time, concurrently with that, a person that is in an AA 12-step kind of program.
PATIENT: OK. Well - my knowledge of them is that it's all this evangelical - and - you know, and that it's very (paternative) (ph) purity and stuff like that. And -
COUNSELOR: (chuckles)
PATIENT: Which I find utterly - you know, anti-scientific. And - you know, it rev - revivalist in orientation. But -.
COUNSELOR: It does have kind of a - these, and it's almost - cultish feel to it. But - therapeutically, what's supposed to be operative there the - the, the support that you're getting. You have a community of people - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Um hm.
COUNSELOR: Who are committed to helping you. And it's a very structured, systematic way of stopping drinking and continuing - 
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: Not drinking. That's - that's the idea of the program. And that's the whole thing with the going to meetings and talking about it and having the whole group of, kind of, non-alcoholics there. AA people. But - but - yeah, it can give it this kind of - right? - almost pseudo-religious overtone. But the idea is that - that you have a whole group supporting you. And a whole group with the same experiences.
PATIENT: Hm. Yeah. They dating Cynthia?
COUNSELOR: (laughs) I don't know about that experience - 
(crosstalking)
COUNSELOR: But some of the other ones. All right? So - but - but anyway, look. That may not be something you're interested in. But that option and others like that are available. [1:05:19.7]
PATIENT: I'm most interested in - your take on it based on what you know about my interactive styles, which is what we know the most about.
COUNSELOR: OK.
PATIENT: If I tend to hide and not confront and scream, run screaming from confrontations, and then go drink myself into oblivion - which I would guess is what I do -
COUNSELOR: That [drinking about] (ph) 1:05:41.2)
PATIENT: Well - I mean, I s - I hid from this confrontation for - you know, a month and a half, two months or four, or whatever you want to call it. You know, I would assume that I do this in other venues. You know, I mean that's what I'm most interested -. I mean, you do know me better in this way. And - and I would think that - I mean, this is what you know best anyway. I mean, in the same way that I can't - I can't comment on - I can't comment on how people live their lives. 'Cause - in general, I'm not trained to do that. But I can tell people that - what's wrong with their houses; because I've been a general contractor, I can speak to at least part of [buck over lasting.] (ph) 
They don't give a shit about what I think about - you know, their multi-deistic beliefs or [I know] (ph). I mean, they - I don't - I don't have any, any - I can't speak to any authority about anything in their lives except those things which I know really well. And it's - I, I think that's what I'm -
COUNSELOR: OK.
PATIENT: Saying is, there must be some take that - that you have based on - I don't know, barely in that knowledge, though, how I interact with people. With you. 
COUNSELOR: Um hm. [1:07:00.4]
PATIENT: Are you driving me to drink? 
COUNSELOR: (laughs) Am I?
PATIENT: (sighs) Sometimes, Jim.  
COUNSELOR: OK. All right. Fair enough. OK. So -. But also, just so you know - not to drive this into the ground or anything - 
PATIENT: OK. 
COUNSELOR: That kind of thing is available for you, if you want to ask for it. 
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: OK?
PATIENT: OK.
COUNSELOR: 'Cause you may not know that unless I - I tell you.
PATIENT: Fair enough. 
COUNSELOR: OK? 
PATIENT: Wednesday. When we meet next month, or do you want to not set a time right now?
COUNSELOR: We can set a time. Is Wednesday the best time?
PATIENT: Yes. I'm afraid so.
COUNSELOR: Six o'clock?
PATIENT: Yes. That's fine.
COUNSELOR: Are these middle-of-the-day times possible for you on any other days - 
PATIENT: Rarely. Rarely. Fridays - Fridays, yes. My boss leaves for parts unknown at two o'clock. And - so - you know. So that's it.
COUNSELOR: OK. So if these times - I, I can usually - work a time like this in on Fridays, too. So that's available. Just - so - 
PATIENT: (interrupts) Why don't we - why don't we - 
COUNSELOR: Let's do Wednesday. And then - 
PATIENT: Let's do Wednesday, and then - see where the - [1:08:16.1]
