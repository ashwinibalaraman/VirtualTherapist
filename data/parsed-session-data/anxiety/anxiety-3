
When I was a child in school in St. Louis, we were periodically
administered something called the Stanford Achievement Test, through
which I learned that there was a Stanford University. I had no idea where
it was, but I was sure this Stanford was the fount of all knowledge, and I
decided that I would some day go there to school. I held on to that fantasy
all through junior high and high school. In 1946 my dream came true when
I arrived on the Stanford campus, known as "the farm." It was no longer
a fantasy.


Coming from a small family, the adjustment to dormitory living was not
easy, but I learned to accommodate the relentless presence of others just as
I learned the table etiquette and rules of social conduct that were a part of
the informal curriculum of this rich-kids school. I heard classical music for
the first time. When a round green thing was served at the dinner table, I
watched closely to see what the others would do with it. I'd never heard of
an artichoke. I listened carefully to the tales told by students whose families
had taken them on trips all over the world. I absorbed information and soon
began to imitate the speech patterns of those around me. If I couldn't be
like them, at least I could sound like them. In so doing I camouflaged myself
so I wouldn't stand out. Fitting in was the organizing principle of my life
at the time.


My first year at Stanford there was just a smattering of males in the student
body of three thousand. The war had recently ended, but demobilization
was slow and only a few young men had begun to trickle onto college
campuses. The following year would see an explosion of veterans flocking
to universities under the GI Bill. That made the possibilities for dating much
greater. Because I wanted to be like all the other girls, I enthusiastically chatted
up the boys and joined in the endless rounds of discussions about who
was dating whom, who I thought was cute, and who I wanted to go out
with.


There were serious limitations on just how intimate a girl living in a dorm
could be with her date. Males were not allowed inside the women's residence

[p. <i>18</i>]

It would have been mind-boggling to imagine that a few decades later
men and women would be living on the <i>same floors</i> of university residence
halls. The prudish restraints of campus life in the 1940s reinforced the mystique
of sex, and the sexual prohibitions of the time probably only increased
its allure. The sexual revolution was a long way off.


In my album of snapshot memories of those Stanford days there are the
boyfriends. Bob was tall, bespectacled, and white-bread to his core. I think
I was attracted to him because he seemed the epitome of upper-class breeding.
He took me home to meet his parents in Pasadena. They were everything
I had imagined they would be—reserved, refined, and stuffy. At dinner the
subject of General Douglas MacArthur came up because he was very much
in the news. I said I thought he was a pompous fool. Turned out he was
the family's dearest friend. I was not invited back.


Next up was Tom, who introduced me not to his parents but to the great
outdoors, which he loved. We hiked and camped and went fishing, all of
which I cheerfully tolerated, but basically hated. Tom was different from
anyone I'd ever gone out with, tough and tender; he had a journalist's curiosity
and he dragged me to see things I'd never have known about if it weren't
for him. Mercifully, he became editor of the <i>Stanford Daily</i> and was soon
too busy to hike, fish, or camp. Our dating tapered off but we did remain
friends, even after college.


Tom was followed by Ed, a fast-talking, aggressive New Yorker who had
opinions about everything whether he knew what he was talking about or
not. He was fascinating, but our relationship ended when I took a death-defying
car ride with him and his friends to Los Angeles, during which they
all sniffed from little white plastic tubes legitimately used to unclog cold-stuffed
noses. They sniffed faster and faster, the car went faster and faster,
and I hunkered down in the back seat scared out of my skull and waiting
for the fiery crash that seemed inevitable. Incredibly, we made it there alive,
but I took the train back to Palo Alto.


All three of my boyfriends became successful journalists, one an editor
of <i>Business Week</i>, one the foreign editor of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and one
a network correspondent. I still find journalists the most intriguing people
to be around. They are engaged in the world, well informed, and have a
broader perspective on life than most people have.

My own dream was to be a journalist or a writer. I took writing courses
from the great Pulitzer Prize—winning author Wallace Stegner, who not only
taught the nuts and bolts of writing but offered cautionary tales about life.
I sat fascinated in his classes, wishing they would never end. One day he
came into the classroom looking very grim. He contemplated the class for
a few seconds, then in a flat voice announced: "This morning, an insane
asylum in Asheville, North Carolina, burned to the ground and Zelda Fitzgerald
with it."


Several people gasped. I waited for his comments. None came. He just
made that stark statement and let it hang in the air. That <i>was</i> his comment,
as if such were a fitting end to Zelda's aborted life journey and required no
further elaboration. His Zelda announcement has stuck in my mind all these
years, and I think of the simple impact of it when I am tempted to elaborate
something endlessly, which I sometimes do to cover my insecurity about
not having any impact at all.


Stegner was a tall handsome man with a craggy face. He had a flair for
the dramatic, often holding his audience spellbound as he reeled out stories
about the creative process. One such story he said contained an important
lesson for us as writers. It was about a man who labored over a novel for
seven years, then went into an emotional decline, and killed himself when
the book was published. The man was Ross Lockridge; the book was <i>Raintree
County</i>, which became a runaway bestseller and a blockbuster movie. The
tragedy of Ross Lockridge was that he had been unable to separate himself
from his work. When he lost his book to the public, he lost control of it.
He could not call back one word. He was exposed to judgments, but he
could not revise. "An author <i>is</i> his book," Lockridge wrote. Ross Lockridge
was in his mid-thirties when he committed suicide.


The lesson in the story of Ross Lockridge for me was about the importance
of keeping a certain professional distance from our own productions
so that we may allow them a life of their own when it is time for that. When
the job is done, let go of it. It is the lesson that parents must learn with their
children. There is a time to allow separation so that everyone can move on
to their own destiny. The lessons of writing often melded with the lessons
of life in Wallace Stegner's teaching.


While I loved listening to Stegner in the classroom, I was discouraged by
his reactions to my writing. He was relentlessly critical, discrediting my ideas,
grading my writing low. I read those papers now and they look quite good
to me considering that I was twenty years old when I wrote them. I began

The Stanford campus is quiet on this sunny Sunday afternoon. Everyone is
studying or at the Peanut Farm drinking beer. I am studying. The door to
my room opens and Janet stands in the doorway, swaying slightly. Janet
lives down the hall. She and I are friends, though we come from quite different
backgrounds—hers old California money, Catholic, convent boarding
Schools, mine middle-class Jewish, midwestern, never away from home
before.


Janet comes slowly into the room, a little drunk, a silly grin on her face.
She sits on the arm of my chair and begins rubbing my neck. I'm uncomfortable.


"Are you all right?" I ask.


Without answering, Janet slides into my lap. She begins to nuzzle her
face into my neck, kissing and giggling. I am afraid to move. I feel Janet's
breathing against my body. I want to put my arms around her, but I also
want to scream at her to get away.


"Janet, are you drunk? What have you been doing?"


Janet mumbles into my neck, "I was out with Richard, drinking. Listen,
why don't we be lovers?"


She lifts her head and kisses me on the mouth, a long kiss I neither reject
nor return. My head feels like it is going to explode; I have such a jumble
of feelings—excitement, anxiety, anger. I feel assaulted.


"Janet," I shout. "What are you doing? What's happened to you?!"


"C'mon, let's be lovers. I've wanted to for a long time."


Panicking, I stand up and unceremoniously dump Janet off my lap. She
just gets up, giggles, leans over, and kisses me again. I push her away. I'm
terrified now.


"Oh, don't be so afraid," she says.


I take a deep breath. My voice is cold. "We can't be lovers. I don't even
know what that means."


Janet rolls her eyes and says again, "Don't be so afraid."


My thoughts are spilling over one another. Is this a boarding-school
game? What does she know about me? How can she be so casual? Why is

[p. <i>22</i>]

"You're being ridiculous," she laughs.


"No, you're the one who is being ridiculous."


I'm sorry as soon as I say it, and Janet gives me a knowing look. She
turns, walks to the dresser, and picks up my hairbrush. Smiling at me over
her shoulder, she begins brushing her long auburn hair in drawn-out sensuous
strokes. I watch, fixated, feeling out of my body, not daring to speak
for fear of what might come out of my mouth.


After what seems like an eternity, she puts the brush down and moves
toward the door. In the doorway she pauses. Staring at me, she nods as if
agreeing with herself about something. She looks amused. The door closes
behind her and she is gone.


I feel as though a great wave has just washed over me and left me standing.
I want to shout, "Come back!" but it is only a silent scream. I am shaking.
I feel very alone.


Janet and I never speak after that. I am too embarrassed to look at her.
When the new quarter begins, I move to another dormitory, but it doesn't
help. I don't want to think about Janet, but when I try to study, her face
comes into focus, crowding out everything else. I'm doing poorly in school.
I wonder if I'm going crazy. I daydream about that Sunday, Janet sitting in
my lap, but I make it come out differently. She stays with me and I hold
her and kiss her. I feel the excitement of her close to me. I want us to stay
that way forever. I think I am terribly sick.


Over the next few weeks, I feel more and more disoriented. I am consumed
with thoughts about what I have become. Is this what I have been
hiding from myself, refusing to allow into my consciousness until Janet
kicked the door open? I don't want to go through that door, but I am so
drawn—so repulsed, yet so drawn. I have to find out, but not with Janet.
I don't trust her. She changes too quickly. I have to go elsewhere. If I am
what I think I am, I have to leave this school that I had wanted to go to all
my life. I don't belong at Stanford.


I spend a lot of time thinking about where I will go. Then I come up
with a crazy plan. I will go to Paris. Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas live
there. It must be ail right to be a lesbian in Paris. I will go to school at the
Sorbonne. I will live among the American expatriates, I will find people like
me there. I will find myself.


In April I left Stanford, deeply saddened but resigned to the necessity of

[p. <i>23</i>]

Yes, my father agreed. If I worked until fall and saved my money, he
would match whatever I saved so I could go to Europe. My father rarely
kept his promises, but I wanted desperately to believe this time would be
different. I made plans accordingly. Of course I couldn't tell anyone why I
wanted to go to Paris, but when I was accepted at the Sorbonne that seemed
reason enough for everyone.


"Bookkeeper Wanted," the sign in the bookstore window read. I knew
nothing about bookkeeping and math was my worst subject, but I loved the
idea of working in a bookstore, especially one at the corner of Hollywood
and Vine, in those days a glamorous location. The Satyr Bookstore had been
a famous hangout for writers like Henry Miller, who was rumored to have
actually lived under the staircase in the bookstore a long time ago. What I
liked best about working at the Satyr was the chance to sell books, which I
did when a clerk was sick or on vacation. I learned the book business there
not having a clue that I would spend many years of my life later selling
books in other shops, including my own.


Though I was enchanted with bookselling, another job opportunity soon
presented itself that I couldn't ignore, particularly one that involved living
away from my parents. I had no idea what I was getting into when I agreed to
work for the rest of the summer at the Golden State Meat Packing Company.


My father's friend Phil owned the rural meatpacking plant up the coast
from Los Angeles in the little town of Santa Maria. Phil needed a bookkeeper
for the summer. The job paid well and I would have no expenses, freeing
me to save for my European trip. The most intriguing part was that during
the week I would stay in Santa Maria.


Phil lived in Beverly Hills with his wife and children. In the early morning
darkness every Monday, Phil drove the 150 miles to Santa Maria, where he
stayed until Friday, when he returned to his family. The idea was that I
would commute with Phil, who in his early forties was an old man to my
twenty-year-old mind. Phil dressed like a Beverly Hills cowboy—pressed
Levi's, crisp fine-stitched shirt, beautifully hand-tooled boots. He was a
handsome man with a full head of sandy blond hair and a tanned, rugged
face. He was my father's friend and I felt safe with him.


The big Chrysler Town and Country station wagon bumped over the dirt

[p. <i>24</i>]

"This is where we live," Phil announced cheerfully.


I sat still in the car, my eye drawn to the corrals a few feet away where
cattle and hogs milled restlessly, noisily mooing and oinking.


"Does that go on all the time?" I asked.


"All the time," Phil answered.


"How do you sleep?"


"You get used to it."


The stench was like nothing I had ever smelled before, a rich mixture of
cow dung, hog excretions, sweat, and something else, the smell of death. I
asked what the other buildings were.


"The offices and the kill floor. Want to see it?"


"Not just yet."


The reality of what I'd gotten into began to hit me. I was about to live
and work in a slaughterhouse. Somehow it hadn't occurred to me that the
Golden State Meat Packing Company was about slaughtering animals. I was
immediately sorry, but I took a deep breath and followed Phil into the house.
He showed me to my bedroom.


"Where's yours?" I asked.


"Right next to yours," he answered.


I unpacked and cautiously went outside to explore. Across a barren patch
of dirt from the house there was something that looked like a loading dock,
where a lone figure sat on a chair leaning back against the wall. He was thin
and leather-skinned; his broad-brimmed hat had slipped over his eyes.


"Hi," I said. "I'm the new bookkeeper."


The man tipped his hat back and squinted at me through slits of eyes.


"Indian Joe," he mumbled.


I realized that this man was quite drunk. Within a few hours I met the
whole crew. Rafe was a giant Swiss-Portuguese, burly and powerful with a
soft, gentle voice. Doc, the U.S. Department of Agriculture vet who monitored
the killing and butchering, was a short, stocky man with a round, red,
angry face. He wore a knee-length white coat with multicolored pens sticking
out of his breast pocket. Portuguese Joe was big and fat and bellicose in his
blood-stained floor-length apron that he kicked with his boots every time
he took a step. Indian Joe was drunk on that first day and every day after
that.


I was fascinated by, and a bit scared of, this rough-hewn cast of characters,

[p. <i>25</i>]

The day at Golden State began with a predawn breakfast in town with
Phil and ended with an evening riding around on dusty country roads so
Phil could listen to the baseball game on the car radio. Sometimes we went
to a movie in Lompoc or San Luis Obispo. Though I was getting bored with
baseball, which I wasn't very interested in to start with, I was okay with our
routine. Being in the country was so very different for me; the closest I'd
ever come to it was the Stanford "farm." I loved the peacefulness, the way
everything seemed to stand still as though waiting for something to happen.
Then, one night, something did.


I was just falling asleep when I heard a frantic scratching outside my
window. I got up to look, but there was nothing there. I went back to bed,
and the scratching started again.


"Phil, do you hear something outside?"


"No, I don't hear anything."


The noise again, louder.


"I sure wish I knew what that is."


"You sound scared. Do you want me to come in there?"


"No. I think I'll just close the window."


The next night the same thing happened—same dialogue, same resolution.
It happened night after night. Phil said it was probably just an animal
scratching around. One night it got louder and louder as though some creature
was trying desperately to break through the wall. I asked Phil if he could
hear it.


"No," he said, but again he offered to come to my room to investigate.


"No," I said. "I'll be all right." I didn't want to act like a frightened female,
but I also didn't want Phil in my room.


One morning I was playing with the dog that lived on the grounds, throwing
a ball that the dog caught in midair. On one throw, he missed and the
ball rolled along toward the house. Running after it, I stopped short. There
was something sticking to the screen on my window. Examining it more
closely, I saw that it was a safety pin hooked to the screen. Tied to the safety
pin was a string, I followed the string alongside the house to where it ran
into Phil's bedroom window.


With a start I realized what had been happening. Phil would lie in bed
and pull on the string to produce the scratching noise that was supposed

[p. <i>26</i>]

"I hear that noise now. Do you want me to come in there?" he'd say.


"No. I'm going to sleep now. Good night." I turned over, smiling.


The string game soon stopped. Phil began going out after our evenings
together. He was obviously moving on to the local women since my presence
was not going to offer the kind of summer diversion he had been hoping
for. I was relieved.


Gradually, I moved closer to the kill floor, first spending time on the
loading dock just outside, later standing on tiptoe to peer through the small
window in the metal door. I couldn't see much, but the sounds were horrendous
—the crack of the rifle, the whirring of machinery, and the whoosh of
something liquid that I could only imagine was blood. One day Rafe caught
me peeking in the window. He put his hand on my shoulder. "C'mon, I'll
take you inside."


I didn't want to go, but Rafe held the door open, beckoning for me to
move. I stepped into the half-dark cavern of the kill floor. The smell was
overpowering. There was blood everywhere. Rafe leaned down and shouted
in my ear, "Watch that chute high up on the wall there."


I heard the crack of a rifle and almost immediately a carcass slid through
the opening and bumped awkwardly down the chute. Portuguese Joe
grabbed the animal's leg and quickly attached it to a chain that hoisted it
upside down to glide along a track until it rested over a large, round, metal
container. With one deft movement, Joe slit the animal's throat and held
the body steady as the blood poured into the bleeding tank. The process
was swift and efficient.


Rafe explained the next steps, then pushed me toward the giant walk-in
freezer at one end of the room. He opened the door to a mist-shrouded
sepulcher where headless carcasses hung. This was the end of the line, the
last stop before USDA inspection and the journey to market and table. I
found myself thinking that I would never eat meat again.


Rafe turned me back to the kill floor and was guiding me toward a piece
of equipment that consisted of rows of huge, whirling roller brushes. Big,
black, hairy hog carcasses were being fed into one end of the dehairing machine,

[p. <i>27</i>]

The kill-floor workers nonchalantly went about their business, their
booted feet sloshing through puddles of blood, the din of the dehairing machine
in their ears as they hoisted, sliced, and hacked away, shouting to one
another, joking and laughing. I trust that more modern meatpacking plants
are operated in a much less blood-and-guts atmosphere than this rural
slaughterhouse was in the 1940s.


To that point, death was something I'd had no reason to think about,
but in that setting I began to think about how much it is a part of life. We
kill these creatures so that we can go on living. I thought about becoming
a vegetarian, but I knew that wouldn't put an end to the killing, nothing
would. This cycle was a contract with nature: certain creatures kill others
in order to survive. It was necessary for balance ... wasn't it?


I was proud of myself for going onto the kill floor and not fleeing in
horror. I proved myself, though for what I'm not sure. After my first visit,
I was able to return to the kill floor occasionally when I had to talk to someone
there or just to convince myself that I could. But when the summer was
over, I was quite ready to move on to the rest of my life.


Children often have fantasies about their parents, seeing them as the people
they want them to be rather than the people they are. Adult children do it,
too. I had a fantasy father—caring, honest, and dependable—but my father
was none of those things. When the time came for him to keep his promise
to match what I had earned so I could travel to Europe, he reneged. It was
as though he'd never made the commitment. The parallel reality he operated
in did not include sensitivity to the feelings and needs of the people
around him.


I was furious at yet another betrayal, another message to me that what
I wanted didn't matter to either of my parents. I felt a deep sadness as I
realized that it was really time for me to cut the cord, to no longer look to
these people for support of any kind. I needed to get away from my egocentric
parents if I were ever to learn to see myself as a worthwhile individual,
deserving enough to matter to anyone. Paris was out. I couldn't afford it.
I substituted Greenwich Village and set out for the East Coast. I was scared
but determined to make it on my own.
