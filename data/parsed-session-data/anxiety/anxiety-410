[p. <i>[87]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My EXPERIENCE indicates that the business called psychotherapy
(or analysis or counseling or any other name used
to describe the so-called talking therapies) is a system of
contradictions.


It is rewarding--It is a waste of time and money<br />
It is fulfilling--It is meaningless<br />
It relieves pain--It induces agony<br />
It is easy--It's the hardest of hard work<br />
It heals--It has no effect


Psychotherapy is all of these and more. If you are involved
in it long enough, all of these things will be true at
some time or other. I went into therapy because I really had
no choice. My personal distress was so intolerable that I had
to seek help somewhere, anywhere. No doubt it is easy for
some people. For me, it was difficult. I think the problem I
am experiencing in trying to write about it reflects this.


Have you ever tried to talk with someone for forty-five
minutes (inflation has shrunk the "fifty-minute hour")

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then what do you do? For one thing, you hate the SOB
who has taken so much of your money, time, and energy,
implied he would help, and has done nothing of any value.
You still hurt, can't sleep, face agonizing periods of despair,
think about ending it all. And he has sat there calmly and
just listened. At least you think he has listened! Undoubtedly
there are times when he didn't even do that.


So now you spend several therapy periods seeking vengeance.
If you're the lucky, open type, you tell him he's a
money-stealing, incompetent charlatan. If, however, your
approach lies in the other more subtle directions, and you
can't tolerate the thought that you do hate him, and justifiably--he
hasn't helped--then you tell him what a fine, helpful,
understanding man he is. And you tell him and tell him
and tell him. Hoping, I suppose, that he will get the implied
message and begin acting like a fine, helpful person!

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then too, you may be the kind of person who can't strike
back at all. You may simply become depressed. You have
been failed again. You can despise yourself, but you can't
hate those who have failed you. Somehow you have learned
that you must not. After all, who can really fail you except
those who matter to you? A stranger? A casual friend? A
professional colleague? No, the only one who is really in a
position to fail you is someone you love. But your anger is
there. It's got to be. You haven't been helped, and you dare
not love anyone. So whom can you hate? Your old, trusty
self, that's who. That's who has been punished all your
life when you were failed, or thought you were failed, by
someone you love, which psychologically is the same
thing.


So you reach an impass. This is a dangerous phase of time
in treatment. If you are so inclined, you can say the hell with
it and quit. Don't chastise yourself that you have failed.
Your therapist is the one who has failed. Of course, you will
do the further suffering, not he. But you can stew in the
satisfaction of your right to suffer.


Then if you can't quit, you can adopt him as your long
lost father (or mother or lover), and try to get him to protect
you forever. Just as you tried, and failed, with your real
father or mother or lover. Or you can destroy yourself with
a cataclysmic depressive anxiety episode and go back to a
hospital or back to the psychological "womb." Or you can
really do it up brown and accomplish your two major goals,
revenge and relief of pain. You can kill yourself. That is
really a pretty effective method. Your therapist will surfer
(although he will eventually repress or rationalize the experience),
and you stop the pain. The only disadvantage to
this alternative is all too obvious. You won't be around to
enjoy either his suffering or your own relief.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>The turning point</b>


This is the point in your relationship with your therapist
when the successful therapists are separated from the failures.
Notice, I didn't say the patient fails or succeeds. The
therapist must stand steadfast and calm against your assaults.
If he "runs scared," you may stay in treatment, but
he has essentially failed with you.


In my initial try at therapy, I reached this point after six
months. I was a slow learner! I remember that one day in my
misery I said, with apparent conviction, "I feel like I could
explode." This must have frightened my therapist. He drew
back in his chair and said rather hastily, "Well, don't do it
here." It was all over then. I continued to see him for about
a year after that. But I was just marking time. He lost me
at that moment.


Not only must your therapist stand his ground, he also
must help you to stay out of a depression or an anxiety state
and out of a hospital, and to remain alive and remain in
treatment. This is a large order and many so-called therapists,
both medical and nonmedical, can't do it. Of course,
they fool themselves and their clients that they are effective,
since many people get well in spite of their therapists' treatment.
Or they can settle for the small gain they have
achieved if they aren't in too much distress.


How can he keep you and help you avoid either physical
or psychological disaster? For one thing, as we said, he
stands fast. You can see that someone you depend on has
strength and stability. You are compelled to note that he
won't cooperate in your self-destruction and that he won't
retaliate in kind to your hostility. If he is defensive or petulant
or anxious and afraid, this is the time that you will find
him out. And you will have been failed again.


Then he must stand fast. But he must also show an unconditional

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The one other thing that he must do is make himself
available to you, both physically and emotionally. By
physically available I mean that he sees you when and
where you need him. He may be tested on this. It's at this
stage that some therapists "cop out." They rationalize and
give logical, compelling theoretical reasons why they never
see a patient outside of regular scheduled visits, or why they
have an unlisted telephone that you can't call. Perhaps they
should review their policies on this issue. It could be that
they are defending their inability to deal effectively with
you in a crisis or that they are just plain lazy. If they are
inclined to the soft life, they shouldn't have chosen psychotherapy
as a career. Along with his physical presence, the
therapist must bring his emotional self. He "shows" that he
does care, that he is concerned about your distress, that he
will not abandon you, literally or figuratively.


Then if he does these things, if he stands fast, gives unconditional
acceptance and makes himself available to you,
he should keep you. But sadly, he sometimes doesn't. Some
people are too disturbed, too overwhelmed by a body or a
mind that can't tolerate the pain, and they are sometimes
lost. Sometimes they are lost for good--to a hospital, to the
bottle or to drugs, to prison, to death, or perhaps simply to
a life of "quiet desperation." Even if this battle is lost, you
may still come back for a new try, and often at another time
and another place with another person, you can make it; you
can win the war. Your way has been helped by all that you
and he have done before, all that you don't have to do
again.

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Winning and losing</b>


Successful psychotherapy is somewhat like winning a
lottery. If it happens to you, it's wonderful. But relying on
psychotherapy to relieve the suffering of all emotionally
disturbed people is like depending on a lottery to solve the
financial problems of all poor people. There just isn't
enough to go around and moreover, some people can't tolerate
that kind of help. It comes too late; it's too time and
money consuming; and its effectiveness is often destroyed
by capricious circumstances beyond control like deaths, illnesses,
moves, and job changes. In addition, it seems to me
that psychotherapy is not often appropriate for those who
are out of step with the marching forces of social movement
itself.


I must admit that I'm not certain what my years in treatment
have done for me. I don't know if I have been helped
or not. I made the observation one day to my therapist that
I wasn't certain if "this" had any effect on my "illness." But
that I did feel I was a better person because of it. Maybe I
was just as depressed and anxious, yet somehow I was better.
I can't seem to describe this feeling well. Perhaps it's
because I simply want to believe that all those hours haven't
been in vain. I almost must believe that.


The effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of psychotherapy
provokes raging controversy in the fields of psychology
and psychiatry. The most objective observers seem to agree
that there is some evidence that "it" is effective to some
degree. There seems to be little conclusive evidence, however,
on how effective it is, and what kinds of people with
what kinds of trouble are helped most by it. There is no
doubt about it, psychotherapy as a method of treating mental
disorders is extremely limited. For instance, the "best"
patient for psychotherapy is relatively young, fairly intelligent,
well motivated, comes from a middle-class back-ground,

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All experts agree that psychotherapy is successful only
for those people who are well motivated.<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12018');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12018" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗There are now exceptions to this general statement, especially from
the conditioning or behavioral therapists. Behaviorists have been praised
and maligned. The aversive treatment of homosexuals or of dangerous
persons, as shown in the movie, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, has been exaggerated
as to its effectiveness. Such treatment is not in general clinical use. It is
still pretty much confined to the experimental lab. Other uses of conditioning,
including applications in the classroom with normal children and
in special programs with disturbed children, have been praised as meaningful
social contributions although the treatment principles are no different
from aversive treatment of criminals, homosexuals, and psychopaths.</div> Yet, it is exactly
this sphere of emotional functioning, motivation, that is
seriously affected by the disorder itself! The paradox is
evident. Disorders of motivation are numerous and serious.
Yet the major treatment modality, psychotherapy, requires
good motivation in the potential client.


I'll never forget the psychiatrist who told me when we
were discussing a particular woman alcoholic that he was
going to have to discharge her from his care. "Why?" I
asked. "Well," he says, "she won't quit drinking."


Other limitations are rather obvious. Therapy may be
lengthy. It is probably going to be quite costly, and it is not
generally available to many who need it. Perhaps there is no
other way to deal with this most common human predicament
since we grow so slowly, and our personalities and
characters are shaped so subtly and so gradually that any
major change in these is laboriously difficult. Yet this reasoning
offers little or no consolation to the sufferer of mental
anguish.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can't decide. On those days when I feel well, I believe
that psychotherapy can offer much to those who despair.
But on those days when I hurt, I am certain that it has all
been a tragic waste of anguished effort. Of course, the circumstances
of my own condition do not prove or disprove
any treatment method or theory. But I'm not interested
personally in proving anything. I only know how I feel. A
philosopher, Ortega y Gasset, said, "Only his sufferings and
his satisfactions instruct him concerning himself."


<b>The final hours</b>


My travels through the therapeutic maze have left me
with a variety of impressions, feelings, and beliefs. At the
hospital, I had two or three thirty-minute periods of individual
therapy with a psychiatrist each week. I also participated
in an hour long group therapy session weekly. Of
course, the various other "therapeutic" activities such as
crafts, games, and physical exercises were also available.
After I left the hospital, I continued individual sessions once
a week with the hospital therapist. This terminated after a
year when I left for another job at the Children's Center.


After I was settled in my new job, I entered therapy with
Carl. I remained in treatment with him for about four years.
After that, I joined one of his therapy groups, which I'll tell
you more about later. I was a member of this group for
almost two years. So I'm well experienced in psychotherapy


It's unfair to my dear friend who worked so long and hard
with me to summarize those hours over a six year period in
a few pages in this book. But somehow I must. I just don't
want to go through all of those many, many hours of tactical
and strategic maneuvering. I think he will understand.

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think I could illustrate the nature of those hours with an
analogy of a chess player and his game. He may sit and
ponder and plan and play many possible contingencies in
his imagination before he moves his chess piece. Then the
movement of that chess piece represents a commitment to
change analogous to "movement" in psychotherapy. The
literal movement of the chess piece occupied only a small
fraction of the time the game required. But those long moments
of contemplation and thinking and apparent inactivity
were essential to the "move."


So it is in counseling and psychotherapy. The nature of
the process is evolving, developing, and changing. And this
kind of process requires an inordinate amount of preparation
for the moment of burgeoning. The peach tree blooms
in about four or five days after budding. But it took four
hundred hours of near freezing temperature during the
course of a long winter to prepare for that bloom.


One time, in the last year of my therapy, I bloomed! A
little anyhow. This occasion was not pleasant. To the contrary,
it was most painful and difficult. And only after some
length of time had passed could I look back reflectively and
realize that it had been a fruitful and productive moment.
A moment that culminated only after some years of seemingly
wasted hours of therapy.


The day before this session, I had to go to Washington,

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went to the meeting I was to attend in Washington. I
tried to take some notes and pay attention to the information
I needed to get. I also tried to avoid having to meet or
talk with anyone there. This was not easy because I knew
a lot of the people there, and I had to use the "excuse me,
I've got a headache" routine several times.


That evening I stood by the window in my hotel room
looking out into nowhere really. I felt lost, desolate, and
alone. I wondered if it would ever end. I felt near the edge
of despair.


The next day I came back to town. As the hour approached
for my session with "him," I grew increasingly
nervous and apprehensive. I was agitated and fearful. I
could only think, with some amazement at myself, "I want
to call him every kind of a son of a bitch I can think of."
But I divorced these thoughts from my emotions. I wasn't
angry. At least I wasn't aware that I was. I only felt fearful
and frightened of what I felt compelled to do.


We spent a little time in the beginning of the hour sparring
around. I talked about my trip to Washington. I mentioned
my despair and my feelings of hopelessness and
helplessness. He made a couple of noncommittal remarks.
Then we were silent. I'm sure my acute discomfort was
visibly obvious. "Why are you so upset?" he said. I didn't

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well," he said after awhile, "I'll help you." He continued,
"Do you want to call me a Christ-killing kike?" My
silence was confirmation. "How about a damn thief and a
chiseling Jew for taking your money and not getting you
well?" He paused, looking at me. But I couldn't look back.
I was utterly miserable. I did want to say those things. Or
at least something as vile and nasty and hurtful as I could.


"What about homosexual?" he continued relentlessly.
"Do you want to call me a queer?" I still couldn't talk.
Finally I said, "Yes, I did want to say those things to you
and about you, but I don't know why."


"Okay," he says, in a matter of fact way. "Now they are
said." He seemed to smile ever so slightly. "So, what else
is new?"


And this then was a moment of blooming for me. Such
a little moment. Not much was done, and it didn't take
much time. I was not even able to mouth the words of hurt
I wanted to say to someone I had come to like, respect, and
depend on. So he had to say these things for me. He set
another time for us to meet before I left for home that day.
The world didn't fall in around me. And he still was my
friend even though I had literally wanted to destroy him.


Although this was my time of "blooming," all was not
roses thereafter. There were periods of regression, of testing,
of new despair. There were, and are now, times of agony and
hopelessness. There probably always will be. But this was
a moment of significance. A moment of blooming that came
to be only after hundreds of hours of preparation and of
near freezing temperatures in my own little psychological
orchard.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Loving and maturity</b>


It's difficult for a fool to change the way he feels or thinks
or acts. Every success he gets and every fortunate thing that
happens to him, he attributes to his cleverness and effectiveness.
On the other hand, he sees every discouragement
and failure as due to the stupidity and contrariness of his
friends, associates, and family. So life's events, pleasant and
painful, confirm what he already believes: that he is smart
and everyone else is stupid, that he is capable and others are
blunderers, that he is kind and reasonable, but he is surrounded
by sour malcontents. Life's experiences don't
materially change him, and he usually fails to profit by what
he experiences.


Surely I've learned something about myself and my life.
As I examine my own mind to see what I may have learned,
I discover to my rueful amazement that about all I can claim
of self-discovery is to have been finally convinced that I am
indeed a fool. I still sulk like a child, punish those around
me for my fears and frustrations, and behave in self-destructive
ways. I've learned that insight without commitment
to action is a fruitless exercise in emotional
masturbation. I've learned to be astounded to find that in
my own life I persist in self-punishing and painful behavior,
even when I recognize my own (not too subtle) efforts
to rationalize my actions. "Knowing" is not necessarily the
same as "doing."


To my utter disgust, I've found that my search for truth
and fulfillment has led me back to the old verities and
clichés that I was raised with. For instance, I really know
that you do get what you give and that life returns in measurable,
comparable proportions only what you are willing to
put into it. You do have to "lose your life" to live it, and
it turns out to be psychologically true that it is more blessed

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It's as if I had struggled to the peak of the highest Tibetan
mountain only to be told by the guru of wisdom at the top
that the secret to life is to keep climbing. To introspect, to
agonize, to go crazy, to writhe in despair, all of this in order
to discover that my salvation lies in my own hands! It lies
in the ability I have to refrain from acting on my destructive
urges to translate my intentions into behavior, to abandon
the search for the magic that will dispel fear, to grasp the
opportunity to do something today that is more productive
than what I did yesterday, to pull myself up slowly, and to
know that it is my responsibility to do so, to suffer the
"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," and to act instead
of react, to abandon my childish needs for undeserved
care and succor and to eschew resentment and bitterness
when I do.


My learning about myself may sound futile and barren to
you. But it is great and glorious to me. I no longer am
compelled to demand that all of my needs be granted by a
world which really owes me nothing. I can now receive
satisfaction and fulfillment by giving the succor and care
that I once had to have given to me. I have learned to accept
the fact that hard jobs are hard to do and that mastery of
myself can only be won by tenacious effort and in small
increments. I've discovered that the struggle begins again
every day and that you've earned no special consideration
from nature because of your accomplishments of yesterday.


I learn anew each day, because I keep forgetting it, that
hate and disgust for others will cause me to suffer and that
vengeance cannot be mine along with peace of mind. I've
found that the offending ones are the unhappy ones and

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Giving and getting</b>


The transitional or pivotal point in psychological maturity
occurs at the time in one's life when it becomes possible
to give more than you get. This is the time of life when
caring for becomes more important than being cared for. On
the basis of this criterion, most of us require a long time and
suffer many painful experiences before we are mature.
Many of us never attain any appreciable degree of maturity;
we go through life demanding care and reacting with bitterness
and resentment when others cannot give it, because
they themselves are seeking the same thing. Unless our
needs for care are reasonably satisfied in our infancy and
youth, we may never attain a satisfactory degree of adult
comfort and competency. If our caring needs were seriously
deprived in our early development, our seeking for succor
might become so frantic, so frenzied, and so overwhelming
that we actually and really are crazy.


The power and purpose of frustrated childhood rage are
more awesome and lasting than most of us imagine. These
remarks of a four-year-old to himself in his bath are a
dramatic but accurate picture of the depth and degree of
childish rage, resentment, and bitterness:
<blockquote>
<p>
He ain't gonna do nothing.<br />
He's just sitting there forever.<br />
He won't eat his peas or his meat or even his cake.<br />
He won't take candy or gum or be their friend.

He will shut them up in the closet and let them
quit breathing.<br />
He don't have to do nothing but sit in the yard all
day long.<br />

all, and if they yell at him, he'll just laugh.<br />
He won't do nothing, and they can't make him do
what they want him to do.<br />
He'll stick out his tongue at them, and tell them
"no."<br />
And he'll just play in the yard all day long.

This poem vividly describes the frustrations, fears, and
hates that we have all experienced. Unfortunately, many of
us carry these feelings with us into our adult life.


It looks as if the human condition and the structure of
society cause many people to be deprived of their needs for
care and comfort. All around us we see people who are
protesting in every imaginable way that they failed to get
what they needed when they needed it. Our hospitals are
more than half filled by sicknesses of the mind rather than
the body. Jails are filled to the bursting point and run a
revolving door operation, spewing out two people and taking
back three. Juvenile courts and detention centers are
overwhelmed by sheer numbers. People can't stand each
other or themselves. Many families are exposed to divorce
or desertions among their members. Everybody has lost a
friend or relative to suicide or drugs or alcohol. And those
souls who manage to avoid becoming a statistic in the ledger
of the courts, jails, hospitals, or welfare agencies--are they
happy, mature, and comfortable? Hardly. Around me I see
people floundering their way through life, seeking the care
they failed to get. My colleague's secretary comes to work
with a black eye that she got at home. A friend's adolescent

<b>Maturity</b>


My work as a psychologist requires me to try to be the
kind of person who is helpful to others who are hurting.
Certainly I can empathize and understand through my own
experiences what it means to be overwhelmed with fear and
despair. I know what panic and turmoil really are, and I
know how guilt and depression can twist your guts as well
as your mind. But knowing and sympathizing are not
enough. I had to learn how I could use my experience to the
advantage of others who were hurting. In my job I see
children who can't learn, or can't manage to behave so that
they can learn. I see kids who are smothered in fear and
confusion. I listen to them and their parents, and I try to
help them clarify their confused feelings and thoughts. I
think about these people. I worry over them. I get angry
with them. They get angry with me. And sometimes they
get a better hold on their lives through what we do together.


My life and my exposure in a meaningful way to the lives
of others have helped me understand and accept that when

Rosen here is describing the mature parent as well as the
mature psychotherapist. They both have had their needs for
security and comfort satisfied, either through the course of
fortunate life circumstances or through the hard way--
through suffering, rejection, and struggle that they have
resolved by means of hard work, or perhaps by means of
hard work and personal therapy with a mature therapist.


Unfortunately, not all parents or all therapists are mature.
Many have unrequited needs themselves that they try to
meet by borrowing from the resources of their patients or
children. The parents we can do little about, since the requirements
for entrance into parenthood are so easy to meet.
We should do a better job in picking and preparing our
therapists. As Rosen says, "Some people have this capacity
for loving as a divine gift. But it is possible to acquire this
the hard way--by psychoanalysis." Pick your parents carefully!
If that isn't possible, be cautious when you choose a
therapist.


<b>Choosing a psychotherapist</b>


It's really misleading to suggest that the average person
chooses a therapist. It would be more accurate to say that

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Speaking from a limited, parochial view with admitted
bias and restricted vision, I must say that I believe that most
of the people doing psychotherapy as a major job responsibility
are not equipped for the task. The formal study of
most prospective therapists is filled with didactic content
that has only a peripheral relationship to psychotherapy.
Furthermore, the actual practice of the art under supervision
during training is minimal and for the most part unsystematically
directed. I have no proof of these assertions
stronger than my observations over the years, added to the
information I get from my associates and colleagues in
meetings, conventions, and seminars.


I am convinced that the formal training of most novice
psychotherapists has left them ill prepared to help a disturbed
person. However, the major concern is, as I see it, in
the personal characteristics of the helping person regardless
of the strength, or lack thereof, of his formal preparation.


I see obviously aberrant, disorganized, disordered personalities
in people who hold themselves out to an unwary
public as psychotherapists. There's the hysterical social
worker whose children have "dropped out," whose husband
has left her. She's in the practice of "family therapy."
Then there's my friend the guru. He's a clinical psychologist
with years of experience. Now he's wearing a flowing sari,
sandals, and hair from here to there. Interestingly enough,
his bag is the alienated adolescent and young adult!


A psychiatrist of my acquaintance has his patients chanting
and humming. They may sit in meditative silence with

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

None of this is psychotherapy. Gullible people are being
seduced with the promise of easy, painless ecstasy, of heaven
on earth, of comfort and joy, if they will only believe.
They are being misled and misused by therapists with more
disturbed, disorganized, alienated personalities than their
patients. Their treatment is their faith. You must be a true
believer. And, sad to say, if you lose your faith, you'll lose
treatment effectiveness.


The sane and mature therapist doesn't demand or need
faith and blind obedience to achieve good results. He
doesn't need or use magic, or exploit the immature remnants
of his client's personality to achieve a worshipful, fawning
relationship with those he would help. He doesn't use his
patients to meet his needs before he attempts to meet theirs.
He doesn't have sexual intercourse with his patients and
rationalize his sensual use of someone as a "therapeutic
technique."


To my amazement, I've found that sexual relations between
client/patient and therapist are rather common in
some circles. There are even appearing in the professional
literature pontifical, weighty discussions of the ramifications
of "love" therapy and its valid use in psychotherapy.
Shades of ancient Rome! I get angry at such use and exploitation
of suffering people. It's no big deal for the authoritative
image of the therapist to convince the dependent,
hysterical young housewife that her salvation lies in his
sexual ministration to her. That's like shooting ducks on the
water.


This is not to suggest that nuts, alienated personalities,
and disturbed people cannot become adequate therapists.
They can; many compassionate, effective therapists have

So if you need help, whom do you get it from? My advice
is to follow the leadership of your stomach! If your gut tells
you okay, then accept the man or woman who evokes that
reaction and work with him or her. If you feel uneasy, if
your gut says "no," then find someone else. My experience,
my observations, and, thankfully, the research tell us that
the best prediction of a satisfactory therapeutic relationship
is the degree of empathy, or warmth and liking, between
patient and therapist.


Beware of therapists who are curt and impatient with
you. Avoid those whose habits and traits offend you. Be
wary of any who require you to believe or behave as they
do. Be cautious if he keeps his home phone and address a
secret. Avoid him if he suggests you might get better faster
in a prone position, especially if he's on top. Listen to the
advice of your stomach and your heart. What do they tell
you? Is he a phony or not? Is he for real--a genuine, honest,
modest man or woman? Is he using you or letting you use
him? If the room caught on fire, would he help you get out
first, or would he bolt and run?


A good therapist should be well trained. It's relatively

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A good psychotherapist will be managing his own life
satisfactorily even though he may have had considerable
personal difficulty. He will show by his behavior that your
needs are going to have first priority and his needs can be
met after yours are fulfilled. He must be patient, but he
must be demanding, firm, and convinced of the correctness
of his methods and techniques. The good therapist will care
in a nonpossessive way for you and for those things you feel
are important. He will understand your thoughts and feelings
most of the time, and when he doesn't, he will say so.
He will be dependable, reliable, and always honest. He will
be an open, nonthreatened person, but one who holds
strong views on basic ideas. The effective therapist will
demand that you work, and he will scold you if you don't.
He will use whatever techniques he has at his disposal to
help, and if his receiving abuse and scorn helps you, he will
accept them. He will care, and his caring will express itself
in anger if you persist in self-destruction. He will be real
and genuinely himself, and his life will be a reflection of his
therapy.


If, after repeated trials, you cannot find a therapist who
suits you, consider the possibility that your hostility and
anger and your ability to rationalize have blinded you to
any valid qualities that anyone may have. Look at yourself
and decide "who's right, me or everyone else?" If after
reflection you determine that your thoughts and beliefs are
valid and others' are false, then suffer; that's your privilege.
