I spend my last night of freedom in the 400 Bar in Minneapolis,
swaying to an unknown band, a plastic cup of lukewarm Sam
Adams in one hand, a cigarette I bummed off someone in the other.
In three months, the jeans I'm wearing, my favorite pair of size 9
jeans that fit just right, won't fit me. This is the last beer I will drink
for over three months. I haven't left for treatment yet, but somehow

with friends earlier in the day. I chug Diet Coke and head to the
bathroom and retch until there is nothing left in my stomach.


I lie awake in bed, jittery with caffeine and insomnia. My heart
races and thumps in an unsteady beat. I should care, but I don't.
Part of me wishes for cardiac arrest because I don't know how I'm
going to let go of this.


My alarm goes off at 5:30 AM, and I wait for the cab to pick
me up and take me to the Amtrak station. As the train lurches out
