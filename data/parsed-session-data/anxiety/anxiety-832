BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: My neck's really hurt.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Oh. When I talk—um—I think I was kind of—it felt like one of these—it felt like one of these conversations that kind of reorients things, you know, obviously, it's kind of, "Here, make a giant change in the way that you relate to people." (laughs) "That you don't do for anyone else; it's really not natural for you." Um—but he heard me. (pause) And, you know, we got to where we were on the same page, and that was good. Um—yeah, so, I feel good about that. And I haven't really been thinking about today, actually. It's just usually I'm—I feel good enough –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —because I'm not worrying about other things.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:01:22].2
CLIENT: I'm going to have to get really good at just leaving in the middle of a sentence because Eric (ph) just does not stop talking.
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: Like, he just does not stop. Yeah. He's made me late for things already, like, in the middle of the week.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So that will be good for me. (pause) I (pause)—I don't know. I—it's weird how things like shift, one thing to the next. Like, it feels like I'm just like in this shifting phase, like I there it—and moved and suddenly I'm around different people every day that I don't know. And stopping one job slash—kind of, you know, just moping around a lot this summer, and you know, hopefully starting something else by Sunday, calling temp agencies and setting up an interview. I had to take one of those like skilled assessment things online—um—but it—I'm—I'm not as good at Office as I thought I was, and everyone else is way worse than I am, so that's alright.
THERAPIST: Right. (laughs) [00:03:03].5
CLIENT: At least I seem to be. 
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I meet the minimum requirements, so ––
THERAPIST: Did you?
CLIENT: —whatever. It's fine. Even in Excel, which, you know, you can do all sorts of cool shit in Excel, but they don't really care about that.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so I know enough. Um—uh—yeah, I'm hoping (pause)—I'm just scared about money. Um (pause)—and it seems like I'm setting myself up for failure to look for jobs that require me to set my own hours—um—because that's what I was supposed to be doing this summer, and I just didn't do it well. And it's not just that I didn't do it well, like I have—I didn't work the hours that I said I was going to work. I just—I just constantly feel bad about it. I'm always like saying, in the back of my head, there's stuff I should be doing and I'm not. So, yeah, I shouldn't have set myself up for more of that. (pause) I don't—you know—I don't know what extent—I'll just keep finding something else to be saying in the back of my head that I'm worried about. (pause) Yeah, got an apartment, and insurance.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:04:46].9
CLIENT: I even, like, know how to file a claim, you know? I haven't done it yet, but I know how to. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: There's just so many details and I can't—I can never remember things for long enough to actually do them, nor let them go. You know, I can't if I—if I—I'm like, "Ok, I have to do X." I will write it down, or set myself an alarm, or write a list of things to do tomorrow. You know, all of the things that I do to keep on task. I can't then forget it until it comes—until the time comes. You know, they say like when you have worries—you know, when people who have anxiety issues should set aside like a worry time, that doesn't really work for me. Like, I worry about time, but I can't—it—I can't—I don't know how to keep it from spilling out.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: It like (pause)—and it's pretty humiliating to have to just like repeat ten times a day to my roommates, "No, I can't—I can't buy a new trashcan, I am broke. Like, you know, I can't do this, I am broke." Like I—I—I'm just anxious about money. (pause) And somehow like—you know, I get like two-thirds of what I'd like to get done every day. [00:06:51].1
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Which is—which is considerable.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because I really never—I never—all the days when, you know—that I'm like, "Well, ok, I'll do this after I'm done with my work for the day." It's like, "Oh, Lord, I never have time for that." I always—it's—it's midnight and time to go to bed.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: That's what it feels like—this sort of—the last couple—you know, part of it is being around people who actually like to spend time with me. Other people eat up a lot of your day. (laughs) [00:07:34].5
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But um—I don't know. I—I'm just not good at time. (laughs) I never know whether other people have this problem also. You know, lots of other people do, I know. But—well, not everybody.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: When I think about high school and like the amount of shit I got done in high school, I have no idea how that happened. I'm sure, you know, part of it was other people were structuring my day for me—um (pause)—I kind of need—just satisfied that I get done with something, because, I mean, the bar is pretty low. Just get done something every day and I—I—you know, I do—I do pretty well considering that I can't feel it. I'm not feeling good enough. [00:08:48].8
THERAPIST: You're just not feeling good?
CLIENT: No. (cries) No. (pause) A lot of people might not agree, but it's so hard. But yeah, I take way too much responsibility for other people. But how do I turn it off? (pause) I haven't cut myself in like two months, and then I scraped my hand on the way over here. And I'm not sure why. (pause) And it wasn't—it's not been like a really difficult fight, like it's not at the top of my priority list. I just haven't done it. (pause) 
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:11:17].3
CLIENT: (laughs) That's an ominous, "Hmm." (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs) (pause) Well, I imagine it had something to do with coming here.
CLIENT: Hmm. (pause) I don't know. It doesn't ring any bell. Um (pause)—yeah. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you know what it is with your neck, like why it's hurting? [00:12:38].2
CLIENT: Oh, I—I think it's because of—because I was taking this, like, test online for like an hour and a half. And I was kind of hunched a little bit and tense because it was hard. And I—like my shoulder muscles are tense and whatever. Like I'm always very tense, but usually not actively headachy tense or like—I don't know. It's usually not as bad. And part of it is that, you know, I'm fidgety—like I'm rubbing it because I'm fidgety as much as because it hurts. Does that make sense?
THERAPIST: Yes. [00:13:31].4
CLIENT: Probably also because it hurts more when I rub it. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: Well, fuck. That's one connection I can stand not to have made. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: (sighs) (pause) My friend told me to chill the fuck out about getting a cat. And I think she's probably right. She just got a cat. I did actually call –
THERAPIST: Sorry. Which way did she mean it?
CLIENT: Oh, like, "It'll be fine, it's not going to be a disaster."
THERAPIST: Ok.
CLIENT: "Cat's are wonderful."
THERAPIST: Ok.
CLIENT: "Isn't it exciting," like –
THERAPIST: Got it. Alright. Yeah, that way.
CLIENT: That way, yeah. I did actually call the vet that's like a block away to ask how much it costs—like what the routine care for a kitten in the first year of life would run, or would cost, just because like—cuz the boys are like, "Kittens." I'm like, "Guys, kittens are more expensive than cats." Like—and they're like, "I don't mind (ph)." And I'm like, "You don't know how expensive this is going to be," so I called and I already—I told them that I'm not going to be able to contribute to that bill, but I am going to, you know, contribute to like daily stuff, so I feel like that's going work out. But it—cats are way less expensive than dogs in turns out, so I think—or puppies are more expensive than kittens, I guess—is more than a kitten. Um—so—sorry, that's the last thing I'm going to do. It's not the last thing I'm going to do, I mean, in terms of like—saying like I—in terms of being—
THERAPIST: It's your (inaudible)? [00:15:55].4
CLIENT: —overbearing. Yeah, or like—yeah, taking the lead on it. And also in terms of trying to dissuade them from this, like—or trying to—saying—just know what you're getting into please. I know (laughs) (pause)—it's like anything within a 60 mile radius of me is my responsibility. Like, I refuse to go to the shelter with them tomorrow. It's like, "I don't want to." Because—but it's not just that cat, it's all the cats. (pause) So I'm trying to chill out. I'm not succeeding very well, but I'm trying. [00:17:02].4
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Um—(pause)—I would wonder if part of what's bothering you is like how much do you really want to be taken care of and you're not?
CLIENT: It's not so much that I feel like I'm not being taken care of. It's more that it's never enough. That like—so I mean—yes and—it's—I—is what I'm trying to say. But—but –
THERAPIST: I think one reason it's never enough is cuz—uh—you have a really hard time letting yourself be taken care of enough, as much as you really need—or it's—in some way that you really need. [00:18:30].6
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. I do have a hard time with that. (pause) You know, I guess this is part of why I need—I need to—let me take care of (inaudible) for helping me feel better –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —about the fact that he took good care of me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It would be more ok. Yeah. (pause) 
THERAPIST: Yeah. It would—I get the impression that you're—that things were—I mean, not often, but probably working hard, talking about work, why do you want to take care of other people? And then like sometimes just being upset, but then kind of quickly refocusing on what there is to do or what else needs taken care of. [00:20:29].8
CLIENT: Yeah. And (laughs) –
THERAPIST: Yeah. (pause)
CLIENT: (laughs) (pause) Yeah. (pause) 
THERAPIST: Is there anything else?
CLIENT: Not really. (pause) 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Had you been rubbing your neck most of the day? I mean, since taking your test?
CLIENT: I mean, it was hurting on the way over here.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. And like I took the test at like—I finished at like 3:30 or 4:00, and then I left at like quarter to 5:00.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Yeah. You think my neck is hurting because of this, because of coming over here?
THERAPIST: Um –
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: —not necessarily, but the way you were rubbing it, and making it hurt, and scratching yourself does sound (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Your neck might be really—I don't know. It certainly could (inaudible), but like –
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: —hunching over and being stressed out like—you know, like something you were doing for an hour and a half, that could be a pain in the neck. [00:22:24].4
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs) I mean—I—I've been wanting to hurt myself more in the last couple of weeks, but this was definitely a—like not nearly as strong of an urge as –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —I had had in past experiences. 
THERAPIST: I had the impression that you were kind of scratching your hand up without really—probably realizing that you were doing it really?
CLIENT: Yeah, that was weird. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Um –
THERAPIST: A little bit split off.
CLIENT: Hmm. Hmm. (pause) I don't know. Like I really—really was looking forward to therapy. Like I really do. So (pause) –
THERAPIST: Well, tell me about that. [00:23:43].5
CLIENT: I feel taken care of. Um—and usually, for one hot minute, there's—I—I feel like I have some type of clarity about what's going on. Um—you know, by the time I talked to James last night, I had completely forgotten what—what I was trying to say.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Or you know, what—the kind of dynamics we had talked about yesterday, I still don't remember them. (laughs) 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Even though I like literally went home and tried to write everything down, it was—it was gone. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But I—I—I—you know, I always feel like I have clarity and it's retrievable. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I remember having it, sometimes. Um—and it is kind of (pause) I don't know. Both the—this is very separate from the rest of my life, and the rest of my life completely feeds into it. [00:25:03].9
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So um—so (pause)—and that's good. Yeah. (pause) You know I worry about money with regard to therapy somewhat less than one might expect, mostly because—I mean, I feel like my dad is like a safety net here, in that one way or another I think—I'm pretty sure he will make sure I'm covered for this. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:25:59].6 
CLIENT: So I feel like mostly secure in that.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But only mostly. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um—yeah. 
THERAPIST: Um—well, uh—I guess when things point in a similar direction, the—like maybe the scratching yourself and like rubbing your neck, the—um—forgetting pretty quickly what we talked about, and the worry about therapy, and the money, uh—being all to do with something that sounds like you're feeling pretty good about and enthusiastic about, to do with being taken care of. Like, "Hmm, almost –"
CLIENT: Ah, that just blew my mind. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Sorry. [00:27:36].9
CLIENT: Keep going.
THERAPIST: Sure. Like do you feel anxious about it, guilty about it, worried about, you know, if you'll lose it, if it's going to be taken away? And sometimes you sort of do take it away after you've laughed—I mean, you know, not in the sort of –
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm not sure that part –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —necessarily fits in as well in that it feels more like it's just very—very complex.
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: Like it –
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: —it's—it—it feels like a very complex set of ideas that I could—you know, like I don't remember the argument of books precisely –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —two months later. 
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: I just remember like how the books made me feel—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —or the general picture of it.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:28:30].0
CLIENT: But the rest of it, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Hmm. (pause) Yeah. It makes sense to me about this cat. It's kind of a big part of my being really—kind of upset about it is that I feel like I don't deserve to have a cat. I don't get a cat. (pause) I try to like shut it down with my roommates, but, oh well. (pause) I want them to like me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I suspect that in about a week and a half, all this—this whole—this week's drama will be gone. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But that's fine. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: That's better. (laughs) 
THERAPIST: That's fine, you're feeling in good company with the cat (ph)?
CLIENT: I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: That's fine, you're feeling in good company with the cat.
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: Yes, yes. (cries) I'm trying not to say, "So what do I do next?" (laughs) And it's really hard.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:31:58].0
CLIENT: (cries) 
THERAPIST: Easier than (ph) what you're feeling now? I mean, going there is easier than—(pause) Sorry. 
CLIENT: Ok.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) 
CLIENT: Well, it's—I—I don't—I don't know where to go (ph).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Do you know what upset you just then or what—what you're—(pause)
CLIENT: When I feel, you know, very taken care of or very cared for, it's—it's a very strange thing. I don't quite know how to—it—it's like really reaching for it and really pushing back at the same time. And I'm like—I'm like –
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:33:41].4
CLIENT: —really, really, really wanting it and feeling like I'm trying to hide from it at the same time. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And it (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Yeah. (pause) It's very strange because of the—crying in front of another person. It's like the greatest luxury there is. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: That tends to be how I see you (ph). It doesn't make very much sense to me. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Oh?
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah. 
THERAPIST: Um –
CLIENT: It was more like that was my feeling, and—but I have no idea why. Like, it doesn't—I don't know. [00:35:31].0
THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. 
CLIENT: I mean –
THERAPIST: Um—well, the first thing that had crossed my mind was at one time it probably was.
CLIENT: You are right. 
THERAPIST: And I—I guess I don't know why that—when you were very little, the—you know, (inaudible)? Uh—(inaudible) like it's a feeling like your parents (inaudible)? I—I guess I'm imagining it is like kind of the base of your experience and—um—yeah. 
CLIENT: Hmm. I was reading P.D. James (inaudible) and I like her. Do you know her? She's the—
THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember her.
CLIENT: Yeah, she writes mysteries, but she—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —(inaudible) like a bunch of (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:37:21].0
CLIENT: But in talking about her early childhood or her childhood, she basically said—I don't know how to put it. She said it really nicely. But it was something about children are so—like have such private lives. Like, they live in just totally separate worlds from their parents. Um—it's just spot on –
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: —in a way (ph). (pause) Hmm. (pause) Yeah I'm—I'm less worried now. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:38:34].5
CLIENT: I'm not sure what circuitous route got me there, but there you go. (pause) Damn it, now I'm worried again. (laughs) Like I said, one hot minute. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, sure. 
CLIENT: It's ok. (pause) 
THERAPIST: It'll get longer.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like—kind of—I don't know what to say. (pause) You know, it's the first time you've said anything about what I stress for (ph).
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:39:56].5
CLIENT: I mean, since like—like initial consultation. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, I know. (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: I was asking because you—uh—felt like you should say something—should have said something before, or because you felt like you shouldn't have said that?
THERAPIST: No, I was—I was more of (inaudible) around—
CLIENT: (laughs) 
THERAPIST: —like, "Oh, no, what have I said." You know, like—yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) Well, I was like (inaudible)—I was (inaudible) about shouting at Eric about that he needs to stop fucking telling me how to treat my depression, than it would be (inaudible). But really I think it would be greater because I'm being (inaudible), you know?
THERAPIST: (laughs) [00:41:00]:0
CLIENT: So, we'll see how that goes.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: I know. (laughs) Actually um—
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Well, I just realize it blows all around (ph), because he's just going to keep telling me how to—
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: —how to exercise
THERAPIST: He's still on about—exercising and (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But it's like he's—like, on another planet—um—it's like, "Don't talk to a woman constantly about exercise and diet." Like, I don't care who anyone (ph) is, just don't fucking do it. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Like, have you met any women? (laughs) Like (laughs)—so you know? So, yeah. But it's just very—he's really intimidating.
THERAPIST: Oh, he does lifting?
CLIENT: He's like really—he's trying to get huge. 
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: He's so cute. And also bizarre. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So yeah, he's like—he like drinks a gallon of milk a day, and like goes to the gym a lot. And he—I like—like the longer I—I hang (ph) with him, the more I'm like, "You are just a caricature of yourself. Like you're just –"
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "– the most ridiculous person I have ever met." And I've met some ridiculous people, so um—
THERAPIST: (laughs) [00:42:26].2
CLIENT: So—but yes, he's still on me about exercise and like—you know, "Try this thing," and "Try this thing." And it feels like it's just kind of, you know, eager curiosity and making conversation.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, it feels very—he's just very sweet.
THERAPIST: Like puppyish.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Although, I kind of also want to warn everyone within a 50 yard radius of him, like don't sleep with this guy because (laughs) at this point (ph) he's not very good with women.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But (laughs) but he is very puppyish.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It is just like this is not good for me.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Like I don't want to keep explaining why I do—why I am treating myself the way I am, why I'm handling it this way. You know, like, "No, I'm not going to switch from one stimulant to another rather than trying—you know, keeping—trying the meds that I have tried, or like—you know, we have like a—like a list of things to try next. It's like four meds long. Why would I switch the one that is already sort of working, rather than –
THERAPIST: (inaudible)
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. He's like, "Well Ritalin had much more of an effect on my mood than Adderall did, so you should try that." And he's says that all the time. Shut it down. Shut it down. Um—but, you know, I'm not terribly good at setting boundaries. And he seems somewhat like he needs to set boundaries early and often.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. [00:44:20].0
CLIENT: So I think I just need to be more clear.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And be more clear before the point where I just can't take it anymore.
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah, like before you get really angry at him.
CLIENT: Yeah. Because I really need to keep telling him (ph).
THERAPIST: Exactly what comes to—yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's—I'm nowhere near really angry at him, but you know, he might make me cry.
THERAPIST: I see. We need to stop for now. As far as next week, I think I had mentioned I'm out Monday. I don't think I did.
CLIENT: You did, but I don't think I (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Ok.
