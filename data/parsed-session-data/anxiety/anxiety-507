BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	And thanks very much for helping with this national initiative.
<b>PT:</b>	Not a problem, anything that might help other people.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's really wonderful of you.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, depression is a particular area of interest.
<b>PT:</b>	And the bipolar.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I know what it can do to you.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's amazing and a lot of people with depression have a period in which they've experienced mood swings or bipolar symptoms.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think I'm going through a time right now where, um, I've been kind of down, I've been sleeping all weekend and everything like that but I really don't want to take more medication, I think it's something that I have to push myself.
<b>DR:</b>	It may be.
<b>PT:</b>	Like today when I didn't make the appointment, I cleaned out my closet.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Which has been years in the making—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I feel like that'll make me feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	That's excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	And we got to have our appointment anyway because I had an opening.
<b>PT:</b>	That was great.
<b>DR:</b>	Fantastic.
<b>PT:</b>	But that made me feel good.  I have to do more things that make me feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Now I haven't started at the gym yet and my excuse is I can't find the workout shorts, that's what started the closet cleaning.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So but money is kind of tough right now and I can't buy
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Things, we're trying to refinance now, it's been a month and a half and we still haven't heard—
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's a lot of pressure.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think because of the turmoil in the mortgage industry?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know what it is.
<b>DR:</b>	I wonder.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, but it was like, like a month ago that it was, you know, all we needed was the appraisal—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	From the VA but I guess they're all backed up—
<b>DR:</b>	I'll bet the VA is.
<b>PT:</b>	Everybody is trying to do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's a pressure and, you know, [NAME OTHER] went down last week, he was feeling really bad with [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	And it makes him snap.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh gee.
<b>PT:</b>	Well just the same thing as [INAUDIBLE] get ticked off at the slightest thing—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and the other day my stepson moved his coffee pot over a little bit—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And, you know, automatically and he yelled at him for that, I know you moved that he said and he said well I had to clean behind it, you know, I spilled something, you know, and he was like, he gets ticked off at little things—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	The heat is killing him—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It's really taking a lot out of him and I guess the pressure of the bills, the waiting on this—
<b>DR:</b>	And of course, you're supporting his son, you know, that's three people in the house, not just two.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I'm really getting tired of that.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	It's getting so I hate to see him come in.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't blame you.
<b>PT:</b>	And that really, you know, I [INAUDIBLE], like I don't want to be like that, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's one thing, you know, it's time when everybody flush with cash and what's the big deal, you have an extended house guest though, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	This is a grown man and—
<b>PT:</b>	It'll be 2 years shortly.
<b>DR:</b>	Two years, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, in November it'll be 2 years.
<b>DR:</b>	It might not be the worst time to point that out to your husband because it sounds like he's starting to feel a little bit of the—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, he is.
<b>DR:</b>	Pouting.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, he says what do you want me to do, tell him to get out [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	But you can say, hey November is 2 years and, you know, you've had a good opportunity to get on your feet and, you know, there's a night shift at Home Depot and all kinds of other jobs out there—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, maybe it's not your first pick but it's a source of income and independence, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	My sons are [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	He's still on unemployment and it runs out Saturday.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	But he did recently get called for 2 interviews.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	He's gone on them interviews before and, you know, this morning, you know, he doesn't have a lot of confidence and he's depressed and—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He's really depressed.  I can't wait till he has medical insurance.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I think Prozac would work for him.
<b>DR:</b>	It might.
<b>PT:</b>	He took it before.
<b>DR:</b>	It might.
<b>PT:</b>	It seems it worked with most of the people in my family so—
<b>DR:</b>	And it is inexpensive and it's generic.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Is there a primary doctor who would prescribe that for him?
<b>PT:</b>	He did have a primary but he hasn't been to the doctors.  We paid for it once because he didn't have the money and he went to, um, the primary doctor and he had pneumonia, I mean we knew it was bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and he sent him for a chest x—ray, you know, I can't let him sit here, that's when he [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Of course not, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] like $75—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Or probably more now.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But thank God we have health insurance.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Between the prescriptions and doctor visits—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh I know.
<b>PT:</b>	Because [NAME OTHER] has the urologist and he has the other guy and he has a gastro guy, you know, all results of the MS.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He's, you know, had a lot of problems this summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Poor guy.
<b>PT:</b>	I know and it makes him a little hard to get away from.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And when I think of going out, I get like anxious because I think part of it is how I look, I'm so heavy—
<b>DR:</b>	You look good though.
<b>PT:</b>	But then, oh thank you, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You look really good.
<b>PT:</b>	I just—
<b>DR:</b>	And your tremor is practically gone.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	The Primidone has been amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	That is wonderful.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Fantastic.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, but I think it's a combination of [INAUDIBLE], I think the anxiety but if I could lose some of the weight, make myself lose some of the weight or at least buy some new clothes—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Whether I'm heavy or not but it's also because like I definitely [INAUDIBLE], you know—
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	It's in the family and I have rosacea all over my face, so that's kind of hard to hide, even with make up because it's bumpy, you know, so I mean some are real things and some are, you know, it's just a combination of things.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and you probably see them more than other people.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm sure.  I mean like I know other people could care less how I look, it's in me.
<b>DR:</b>	You actually look well put together too, you know, you may not feel that way but you are.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't feel that way but, you know, and at work I still have 9 months of [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I have to get it done by August, you know, by [DATE] at least.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's so hard to focus.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I've let it get overwhelming, you know how it, you know if you let your house get dirty it just becomes overwhelming.
<b>DR:</b>	But just like the closet today, you know, you just chisel away one little bit at a time.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I've got to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm starting—
<b>DR:</b>	Any is better than none, just like exercise and I love that you're thinking about the gym.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, those girls at work are still going so—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	And I was the biggest loser this time, we have this thing where we go, um, like for 4 week then we weigh ourselves every Wednesday and I lost the most again.
<b>DR:</b>	Way to go.
<b>PT:</b>	The time before I lost 5 pounds, this time I lost like 4.
<b>DR:</b>	Not bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, right, so you know, I know if I did exercise I would lose the weight—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I'm doing absolutely, I'm a cough potato now—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And so I maintaining weight.
<b>DR:</b>	So how are you losing it, are you cutting out, like are you moving from low fat to skim milk or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm—
<b>DR:</b>	Just eating less?
<b>PT:</b>	I've always liked skim milk but I don't know—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I really don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you by any chance weigh yourself every day?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	I've been hearing that the people who do tend to do better with the weight loss and I think it's just having it in your mind.
<b>PT:</b>	My scale broke and I threw it out.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, all right.
<b>PT:</b>	But it does make me feel good in work when I'm the—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I was the biggest loser—
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	So it makes me feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	You guys ought to do a little wager like, you know, a couple bucks a week and winner take all.
<b>PT:</b>	We're talking about it—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh good.
<b>PT:</b>	Because 2 of the girls that are in it are the ones I want to go to the gym with.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh that would be so great.
<b>PT:</b>	So if I could actually do what I know I should do—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I'd feel a lot better.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think it's a matter of, uh, medication, you know, I think it's I make myself depressed because depression allows you to do nothing, you know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	It kind of feeds on itself—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes and it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Such a familiar thing to me—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	That, you know, it's like you wrap yourself up in it.  Well, I can't do anything, I'm depressed—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I think that's what my son is doing now.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe.
<b>PT:</b>	He's so down, no confidence, no nothing but—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad he's got interviews and he's going to the interviews, that's, you've got, that's your square one, you've got to get out there and—
<b>PT:</b>	And I think he's got that depression thing that runs in the family, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Could be.
<b>PT:</b>	Everybody in my family has depression problems and bipolar and then the 2 people that were, 2 sisters who were schizophrenic—
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I think, you know, it's just such a combination of things.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know and I need, it's like if I want to go take a nap, I have to earn it, you know what I mean, I have to do something, like I'll wash the curtains and put them back up, okay, you know, I deserve a nap, whatever, but um, it's just, I guess I'm sleeping, I don't know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't been able to read lately either, I can't concentrate.
<b>DR:</b>	That's come and gone hasn't it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it has and it's come back—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's gone and it's so weird, you know, because all my life I've read—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And now I can't get into anything—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And then by the time I get back to the book, I've forgotten what I've read, you know what I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So I guess the short term memory isn't as good as it, you know, once was, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And I was wondering about the Klonopin—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	If I should start taking 1 in the morning maybe to, you know, get me going or whatever, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Did it help in the past?
<b>PT:</b>	It has helped in the past.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, yeah, everybody is unique in terms of how they respond to medication.
<b>PT:</b>	But I would do it depending on how I felt.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	If I felt where I actually anxious about going to work or I was, you know, [INAUDIBLE] or something, not like every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I still take the 1 at night—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	So I think that works.
<b>DR:</b>	And you are on the 20 of Lexapro, you are on the Wellbutrin XL—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	The Lamictal, the Trazodone, so you've got a good number of antidepressants working for you there, um, but yeah, I don't have a problem at all, an extra option of an extra Klonopin might help overcome that morning anxiety, no problem.
<b>PT:</b>	I, um, I'm working 8 to 2 now so—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	During the summer—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	The teachers don't work.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	They're off, you know, there's no class with the [INAUDIBLE] them so—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I don't have that, so because during the winter I have to work 12 to 6—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because they don't come in till around 3 or 4.
<b>DR:</b>	I see.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, but I, sometimes I think I like the 12 to 6 better, it gives me more time in the morning to get oriented—
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like you're a morning person in terms of getting going and once you get out of bed.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I'm slow, I'm pretty slow—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	It takes me 2 hours to get ready for work.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Do believe that.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you cleaned your closet this morning and everything, I was impressed.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm not even done—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And I spent 3 hours getting it—
<b>DR:</b>	I bet it's a big job though.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got a Klonopin with a refill.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.  Do you need an order for 2 a day though?
<b>PT:</b>	It says it on it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, so it's already on there, okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, 1 to 3.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	All right, excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm good with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, no problem.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just that I have to put it in [DATE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Or [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you for keeping track and, of course, everything you're taking, I can also call in.  You know, if they say, oh the refills are expired or whatever, fine, let me know, I'll call it in, it's not a problem.
<b>PT:</b>	They, we're on a first name basis with the pharmacist.
<b>DR:</b>	Well that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	They all know us.
<b>DR:</b>	Actually, a good pharmacist is worth their weight in gold.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	They really are.
<b>PT:</b>	They caught one time this other doctor had given me a prescription and they called me up and said you can't take this with what you're taking.
<b>DR:</b>	Ah, good for them.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I called the doctor back and, you know, they told me and it's surprising, you know, because every time I go to the doctor I take a list of all my pills with me—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	To make sure he's up to date.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, sometimes, you know, they get busy or distracted or they've got a lot of things going through their mind that doesn't always pop up so that's why it's nice you've got the pharmacist monitoring too.
<b>PT:</b>	And my teeth are getting better.
<b>DR:</b>	Good, they look excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	But that has been going on for a while, getting in and out was so [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And my dog the other night, he embarrassed me so bad—
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it was just [NAME OTHER] and I home and I took them out and wrapped them in a paper towel and put them in my handbag, right—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So young [NAME OTHER], he and his girlfriend came in and my dog was going through my bag.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no, they'll get into everything won't they?
<b>PT:</b>	And he pulled them out—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And they fell on the floor and his girlfriend picked them up with the paper towel and put them back, then he went back in again and was getting them.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no, he thinks this is a great game.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so we had to snap my handbag all up so he wouldn't get it.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, they are amazing, they'll get—
<b>PT:</b>	So I hadn't washed them yet, so he smelled the food on them.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, oh my—
<b>PT:</b>	You know.  So [INAUDIBLE] embarrassing moment but uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Pets are something.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not looking forward to getting the other ones out but they have to come out.  I better do it while I have insurance.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's another thing, I feel really bad [INAUDIBLE] I'm not going to have any money when [NAME OTHER] dies—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I'm so afraid of it, to see what my sister is going through.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh that poor thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she, you know, her husband left her [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yikes.
<b>PT:</b>	And now she's, you know, struggling and struggling.  Her husband was [INAUDIBLE], her son doesn't have [INAUDIBLE] to help her—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and she hates to ask.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's a shame.
<b>PT:</b>	But I wish I had her confidence, I'll tell you, I mean she's [INAUDIBLE].  She goes to all kinds of concerts, her and her boyfriend—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean she's, she seems to have a self confidence—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Where I was always they thought had, you know, they didn't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I can see both of you being very popular.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's, oh everybody was, my sister, she is such a sweet [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I worry about losing her, you know, I call her up, I mean she was going to the hospital to get a stent put in her kidney—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and she had just had her eye operated on, you know, 3 days before—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	That's from the diabetes, you know, she has [INAUDIBLE], uh, what do you call it, both of her husbands smoking all those years, she never smoked.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, so did she get emphysema from—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, from her husband.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Diabetes bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Yikes.
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes her sugar is 500, 600.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] she lives with, her boyfriend, he's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	She's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	And he has something planned, I mean they go 4 or 5 nights a week to events and he loves [INAUDIBLE] so they go wherever he is and all.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	And I really, you know, I—
<b>DR:</b>	That's a busy lifestyle, that's a little busier than I think I'd prefer personally.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, yeah, she said her son is jealous she has more of a social life than him but, um, I think she runs herself into the ground.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and [NAME OTHER] mentioned to me one time, he said do you think she wants to die, I mean do you think, you know, I talked to her about it, I said [NAME OTHER], I mean do you want to live.  I mean they go to these buffets with all this rich food—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And she eats it an all and I said don't you want to live and she goes, well most times I do, she said, but when I'm struggling with these bills and all this, you know, and everything.  I said, because you know you're killing yourself by all this, you know, it might be fun but I mean they'll go concerts where you have to stand up for 2 or 3 hours.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, or be out in the heat and she burns and plus the diabetes, plus the air quality.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, she is pushing the envelope definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	If I lost her, I would really, that would really, really be [INAUDIBLE].  We talk every day, sometimes twice a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	She's been a great help to me, you know.  [INAUDIBLE], you know, I just really want to push myself to do these things.
<b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.
<b>PT:</b>	But I've got to do it.  I'm here and I say it but then when I get home there's some excuse why I can't go, like I can't find the work out stuff and like I said, that's one of the reasons I cleaned this and I still didn't find them because I only did the top thing and the middle thing where the clothes are at, down the bottom I have so much clothes, I mean I such beautiful clothes when I was thinner, I hated to get rid of them.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But today I said that's it—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm never going to be a size 10 again, you know, or a size 12.
<b>DR:</b>	I think the same thing, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean they're just, you know, so pretty, I hated getting rid of them.
<b>DR:</b>	They will probably go to somebody who can really appreciate them.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I'm giving them to a girl, some of them to a girl in work and then the rest of them to Goodwill.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, good.
<b>PT:</b>	They're all in very good shape.
<b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.
<b>PT:</b>	Some of them were still in the cleaning bags.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I mean I'm trying, I've got to start doing what I say—
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	Instead of putting it off and then [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, like you said, that closet has been sitting there for years—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And you do need the work out clothes and this gets a chore done that you've been avoiding, plus it'll get you access to the clothing so you don't have to buy new ones.
<b>PT:</b>	Plus I have more room.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, you can find things if you have room.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], you know, I think I bought one pair of shoes but no summer clothes at all, I have about four outfits.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, fortunately, the place I work is very relaxed—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	And casual.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you need to be comfortable if you're going to be doing all that physical activity.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I have to put it all in alphabetical order, I'm not kidding, I've got like about 5 piles—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	That I have to get done.  I've got some hidden in the cabinet.  I've got to do it, if my boss ever comes out there and sees, you know, they'll be like why do we keep you all summer if you don't, you know, do anything but it was during the year [INAUDIBLE], you know, I get off on tangents, like they'll [INAUDIBLE] and I'll stop what I'm doing and go do that—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And do this and, you know, send stuff to the state and I'll let that take up too much of my time.
<b>DR:</b>	And the depression was taking over for a while.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, so I've got to get focused and maybe the Klonopin might help.
<b>DR:</b>	Especially if what's clouding your mind is anxiety.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I guess the other possibility would be an attention deficit kind of situation or even side effects of the medication.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	She just, I mean the stories, you know, I don't want to hear them—
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	But her boyfriend [INAUDIBLE] who got out of prison not too long ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Yikes.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], she was always saying, oh [NAME OTHER] really likes [NAME OTHER], you know, [NAME OTHER].  She said, you know, he really likes to talk to him and all, can you invite us over some time, then—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] told me, here he's like a transgender type person.
<b>DR:</b>	Yikes.
<b>PT:</b>	When he's around the house, he dresses up in her clothes, she does—
<b>DR:</b>	Yikes.
<b>PT:</b>	She does his make up for him.  I mean she's already unstable and, you know, bipolar.  She needs this, you know, and she—
<b>DR:</b>	Um.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's depressing, I'm like oh my God, you know, it's like she's a teenager, like we talked about before.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean she really [INAUDIBLE], you know, if she could just get some therapy.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She's been working with somebody but, you know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's so bad because she's going through the thing with my dad all over again because of the drugs.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	She had self medicated herself for so many years.
<b>DR:</b>	She's haunted, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She is.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, everything she was covering up is coming out.
<b>PT:</b>	And she's told me things that, you know, about [INAUDIBLE] trying to kill herself.  I mean I knew she tried to kill herself a couple of times but the one [INAUDIBLE] but she told me she put a knife in the springs of her bunk bed and was like trying to jump up and stab herself.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh goodness, that's so sad.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, then she told me about another time where she cut her throat but she didn't do it enough, deep enough to—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE] and that happened to me when I was young, my older sister, next oldest sister, you know, came to me when I was in the bathroom, [INAUDIBLE] and everything and she said don't tell mom and dad but I took a whole bottle of aspirin, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure, don't tell my mom and dad.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	I know.
<b>PT:</b>	Stuff like that was always happening, that's what I grew with.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and sometimes I couldn't [INAUDIBLE], you know, I worked through a lot of it but when my sister talks about it or somebody talks about it, you know, or I happen to see a movie that has anything to do with it—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I, you know, it just grabs me.
<b>DR:</b>	So many painful memories.
<b>PT:</b>	I have nightmares about it.  Because I was still at home, I was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, when it got bad.  I just try not to think about it, you know, and then my son is always bringing up, you know, oh, you know, I couldn't get anybody to marry me, he said who'd want to take a dip in this gene pool, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Unfortunately, he [INAUDIBLE].  My sister, my mother used to watch [NAME OTHER] when he was little—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And my sister would be screaming around the house, my father raped me, dah, dah, dah—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	All this stuff and he was there—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	And I didn't know it, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	It's just sad.
<b>PT:</b>	And then she went, she went to walk him up the store one time and hitchhiked with my son.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my word.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean but then I feel so sad for her because she's had no life.  They took her children away from her.  Fortunately, they were adopted within the family.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and they know their brothers and everything but she's had nothing, I mean that's why I take her every holiday, I mean I'd like to go out—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	I'd love to go out but I know nobody else will take her—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I take her for her birthday and Mother's Day or like, you know, [INAUDIBLE], Christmas—
<b>DR:</b>	You're very good to her.
<b>PT:</b>	Easter, um, Thanksgiving, you know, [NAME OTHER] goes every 2 weeks and like gives her a little bit of money and everything.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's incredibly nice.
<b>PT:</b>	And nobody ever asked him to, you know, but unfortunately, she thinks he's the ATM.  He is, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	That's kind of a sad thing because it just doesn't sound like she's really grown up to full adulthood, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, she's, you know, she'll be over and she'll, you know, sometimes she'll start talking to herself and it's just so sad and I get mad at her and I think it's because I want her to be okay—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	So bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she can push my buttons like nobody.
<b>DR:</b>	Siblings can, right.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like whatever you give her or my sister, it's never enough, they want more.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, if you give them like a thing of [INAUDIBLE], you know, that I made or whatever, well can you give me some of that
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, my sister, like when we have leftovers from, um, Christmas, you know, I just have a buffet and all and she'll say, oh can I get this, can I take that, it's like, you know, we have to eat too—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	And she wants to be taken care of.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That extra edge.
<b>PT:</b>	They would suck the life out of you if you let them, so I try to distance myself—
<b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.
<b>PT:</b>	But [NAME OTHER] will call, she'll talk the whole length of the tape, then call back—
<b>DR:</b>	Whoa.
<b>PT:</b>	She tell him, I'm going down the shore and you said you would give me some money, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	So I can go and blah, blah, blah.  They take them to [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, what the hell you going to take a group of mentally disabled people to [DEIDENTIFIED] for.
<b>DR:</b>	I guess they have a right to go just like everybody else.
<b>PT:</b>	I can see—
<b>DR:</b>	But will they have fun.
<b>PT:</b>	I can see [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	None of those people have money to gamble, you know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure and it's a very stimulating environment—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	The bright lights, lot of noise, lots of things going on.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] get lost in there.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, absolutely.
<b>PT:</b>	My husband walked in [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, I haven't been down there in years, there's a lot to see.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, we walked in there one day and [NAME OTHER] was in there—
<b>DR:</b>	Whoa.
<b>PT:</b>	They had taken them to the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, surprise.
<b>PT:</b>	Because you have a buffet at the time, you know, you pay $5 or whatever—
<b>DR:</b>	That's nice.
<b>PT:</b>	You get a buffet and, you know, drinks free or something, I don't know what it is, but I was shocked.
<b>DR:</b>	You have to come down here to see your family, oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, all in all, I just try to do what I can but it's hard, it is hard because it hurts.  Every time I talk to my sister, [NAME OTHER], it's so sad, you know, and [NAME OTHER] is, it's like the movie, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	When [NAME OTHER] comes out of his therapist's office—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And the people in the waiting in the room and he goes, what if this as good as it gets, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's like, I know [NAME OTHER] is as good as she's going to get.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that could be true.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	That could be true.
<b>PT:</b>	And I can't help but think that [INAUDIBLE].  She has somebody that sees her 15 minutes a week or whatever, it's very sad.  The institutionalizations she's had, you know, and I get afraid with [NAME OTHER] that this is as good as she's going to get, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's hard to say, it's possible.
<b>PT:</b>	Living with a transgender person, you know, putting make up on, you know, it's just too weird, it really is.  She drives my sister [NAME OTHER] crazy.  She come over my sister's house [INAUDIBLE] whatever and she'll go through my sister's things.
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't that so strange when people do that, as if it's their things.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	I never understood people like that, never.
<b>PT:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] did it before too and she asked my sister about something that she had, [NAME OTHER] came home and she said, well I guess I can't have these earrings and my sister—
<b>DR:</b>	Whoa.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	She's going shopping in her sister's house.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous.  Wait for the yard sale.
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were impulses buyers, their house is full of junk that, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	They're going to need to do—
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER] sold a lot of it, uh, a couple of [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Good for her.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I had to push her but, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Have you ever seen the show Clean House on the style network?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	It's kind of fun.  They, um, they get people, usually it's to solve clutter problems and they get people to have a yard sale and, you know, sell a lot of the stuff that's cluttering up their house, then the people on the program match the proceeds up to $1000 from the yard sale and they provide all the design, cleaning and painting themselves and sometimes additional gifts—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Like whether they need a bedroom set or whatever and it's a promotional opportunity for the producer of the item—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, but it is nice and it really does, you know, look at people dealing with clutter and making decisions and—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, sometimes it's hard to make a decision whether to get rid of something you don't really need.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Like today getting rid of those clothes, that kind of hurt—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure it did.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I remembered when I wore this or I wore that.
<b>DR:</b>	Certain things have a sentimental value.
<b>PT:</b>	And these are just like [INAUDIBLE], all the 10's are downstairs—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I need to get rid of them, cute little shorts and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	All little things but it's never going to happen, I'll never get that small.  A couple years ago I got down to an 11, like 11/12.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	That was pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My sister's husband had just died so we were [INAUDIBLE] and I was out of work on disability because my mind just—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Couldn't take anymore, I mean the job I had was so hard and I didn't have cooperation, my manager was an idiot—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, he never wanted to be bothered with anything.
<b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous, what's he there to manage then?
<b>PT:</b>	I know, I was the purchase agent, purchasing agent but he had to sign all the purchase orders—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And they'd be sitting in his desk for a couple of days—
<b>DR:</b>	That's absurd.
<b>PT:</b>	And then people would be calling me, yelling at me—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, what happened to my purchase order, I need this.
<b>DR:</b>	It has to have his signature.
<b>PT:</b>	Security, everything revolves around security and if they don't have their stuff, like they ordered at the last minute, the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.  That's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	And you know, a lot of things, you have to have lead time on—
<b>DR:</b>	Darn right.
<b>PT:</b>	To get and they would do that but they didn't care about that and I couldn't really like what happened to me or whatever, I couldn't really get—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	On them, you know, anyway, it got so much so I was out on disability and [NAME OTHER] and I went everywhere, you know.  My girlfriend would give us her place down in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	We went to a [DEIDENTIFIED] thing at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	I didn't know they had one.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, we were on TV.
<b>DR:</b>	No way.
<b>PT:</b>	We just did all kinds of different things and I think it was not sitting home, it was like—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	We'd go over to the [DEIDENTIFIED], have you ever been there?
<b>DR:</b>	No, I never have.
<b>PT:</b>	You've got to go there, it's fantastic.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it antiques?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, it has antiques, oh—
<b>DR:</b>	I love stuff like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Beautiful things, like church pews and beautiful, the old hand carved, um, bed things—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't think of the word but, and they have silver, new stuff, new silver, beautiful, you know, rings and necklaces and fun watches like this you can buy for $10—
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, that kind of thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So we went over there once a week and, you know, gas was cheap them compared to—
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	I think I was happier, the pressure was off with, you know, work, I wasn't every day, because I'm not the kind of person that can leave it at work, when it's, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	It kind of takes over everything.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm really good about not taking things to work—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean everybody thought I was like, oh nothings wrong, you know, but I'm bad about bringing it home—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Like it will weigh on me, I mean I wouldn't take it out on [NAME OTHER] or anything but, you know, I really [INAUDIBLE], you know, sometimes I work 6:00 in the morning till 6:00 at night—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, that's a lot of pressure.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And when I went back after the 6 weeks or whatever, they wanted to put me on probation for something—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I had given this girl, the accountant, I had said to her, here, these are the things that need to be worked on and I had okayed [INAUDIBLE] that's what you go through for the guns—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, people coming in the building—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I had okayed it because [NAME OTHER] handled it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well sure.
<b>PT:</b>	You know and we always did that, okayed it, you know, and then he'd just sign the purchase order.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Well that's what they wanted to put me on probation for.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	She let that sit on my desk the whole time.
<b>DR:</b>	That's not your fault.
<b>PT:</b>	And then corporate heard about it and blah, blah, blah—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I said you know what, I'll save you the trouble, you know, I'll resign.
<b>DR:</b>	That's ridiculous.
<b>PT:</b>	When I think back, I really could have had a case—
<b>DR:</b>	For sure.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and, you know, whatever and they were just making it worse, you know, but uh, you know, then I was just [INAUDIBLE] for a while.  I don't know, I'm—
<b>DR:</b>	It's been a long road.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh my gosh, yeah, it's been really bad sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	It's quite a family history too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.  Back one of those times when I couldn't get out of bed and I hurt so bad, I was [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, did they ever figure out what it was?
<b>PT:</b>	They just, never, they sent me to heart doctors, they sent me for all kinds of x—rays, CT scans, blah, blah, blah, and finally they, I think they just guessed it was a virus that had to run its course—
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But I was a bone, I couldn't eat—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I think the doctor I was seeing at the time, she said I was so depressed that I lost all interest in food or anything else.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I was out on disability from my job at [DEIDENTIFIED] then, so it's like every so often I just totally burn out.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, and that's why I took this job, thinking that, you know, how much pressure can filing be but this is pressure I caused myself because I didn't do what I was supposed to do and I've always [INAUDIBLE] work ethic.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not used to these teeth yet.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, you're making yourself very well understood though.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh good, I'm glad.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I lisp sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	It doesn't really show.
<b>PT:</b>	That's great.  But, um, you know, it just seems like I burn out like every 2 years.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Well it took, I think it was at the [NAME OTHER] down in [DEIDENTIFIED] you know, and I was at [DEIDENTIFIED] like 12 years before it burned down.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	And I would just [INAUDIBLE] and I would just stay home and cry, I'd take sick days
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE] and I'd just, you know, sit there because I was struggling with everything, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] so but everybody thought I was just wonderful, look what she does.
<b>DR:</b>	You put on a positive face to the world.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh my God, I was president of the parents association—
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know how you ever did it.
<b>PT:</b>	I was on the board of directors for the daycare center, there was like four or five of them.
<b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I spoke in front of 2,000 people at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	For [DEIDENTIFIED]'s 100th birthday.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I was the, uh, what do you call it, MC, whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so cool.
<b>PT:</b>	I still can't believe I did that.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I've done things, you know, that I never thought I could but I did them.
<b>DR:</b>	You did, how did you do it?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I always thought, they could [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes going through the motions is enough to get you back on track—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Get the ball rolling, you know, even if at first it's like just having to drag yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  My twin cousins hated me because my uncle was always saying, you know, why can't you be like [PATIENT NAME].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Look at her, she does this, she does that.
<b>DR:</b>	Adults don't realize.
<b>PT:</b>	He did not know—
<b>DR:</b>	They're just separating the cousins by doing that.
<b>PT:</b>	I could not get out of bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And one of them I worked with but, you know, so it was just, you know, and everybody is, oh [PATIENT NAME] you're so beautiful, you're so wonderful, you're so this and I'd be like, oh I'm fat, be thinking I'm fat, I'm, and I had to look twice as good just to be even—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean and it wasn't about anything else—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It wasn't about attracting people, it wasn't about, because my, my brother in law didn't like my sister to go places with me because he thought I attracted men too much, you know, and stupid me, I always thought men were just so helpful.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it was just, you know, I'd walk in a room and people would look and I'd think, is my zipper down or is there something wrong, is slut written across my back or, you know, I never appreciated it when I had it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Now, my God, I wish I had it back but I never thought I was all that and my family did and they were even jealous, they used to call me fancy [PATIENT NAME], my sister and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, but they were still proud of me.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	If they wanted to trot somebody out to meet somebody or whatever, it was here I am and they always said I was [NAME OTHER] trophy girlfriend, you know.  He even told me that he thought that he did better than he ever imagined.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's so sweet.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he never told me I was beautiful, I love you—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, where was all this positive reinforcement.
<b>PT:</b>	It was kind of like a status thing, oh, I did better than I ever thought I would, you know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I know, it just really hurts and I still have a problem with him.
<b>DR:</b>	I was wondering.
<b>PT:</b>	I still do, I still dream about him at least 3 or 4 nights a week and didn't we run into at a Wawa.  Thank God I was in the car, I would have died if he saw me like this.
<b>DR:</b>	How long ago?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh about a week.
<b>DR:</b>	A week ago, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he lives right near the Wawa that's right near the prison.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay, you
<b>PT:</b>	You know, [INAUDIBLE], so um, you know, before I saw him in there and I was going to leave but I walked around the back of the store because he was paying—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I—
<b>DR:</b>	You figured you could make a getaway.
<b>PT:</b>	I would never want him to see me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	He still looked the same.  He's got a few more wrinkles but his body, everything is still the same.  He looks like a kid.
<b>DR:</b>	Some people just have that metabolism.
<b>PT:</b>	It's disgusting.
<b>DR:</b>	I know.
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's in his genes because his father always looked really great.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He's got some gray hair but he's still perfect.
<b>DR:</b>	Some people just inherit the good genes.
<b>PT:</b>	I got the bad genes all over the place.
<b>DR:</b>	But on the other hand, you're a very strong person too.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think, I go with that thing, if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I've lived through a lot of things that maybe other people couldn't handle, you know, I just always felt like, you know, my dad always said you've got to do something even if they're [INAUDIBLE], you know, you've got to move—
<b>DR:</b>	Rather than take no action.
<b>PT:</b>	And you know, and then I had my son to motivate me.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Because of my childhood, I wanted him to have [INAUDIBLE] but in the meantime, I sheltered him from any kind of anything so that he, and he didn't have any siblings, so he never learned that, you know, teasing kind of thing—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He would always get hurt and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, he just never learned to cope with anything and he seems to have, take after his father.  He's not driven at all.  He's not motivated, you know, but [INAUDIBLE], you know, because I don't know what to do for him because if he loses his place, I can't take him in.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got big boy there.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly and you want him to be able to find employment too, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Right now, our [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no and I have a feeling I know who's the only person who is putting anything in there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	With what money.
<b>PT:</b>	You know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I mean we have pasta and, you know, some stuff, we have some stuff in the freezer but you look in the refrigerator and it's like bread, milk, not bread, like butter, eggs, and uh, you know, mayonnaise—
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe some spaghetti sauce.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm making that tomorrow night.  You know, it's been a rough summer.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's hard to believe, I think we're more than half way over.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, this [INAUDIBLE] if we get this refinance done.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I hope so.  I hope that comes through soon, it's so hard to be in limbo for so long.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know, it's killing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	The stress, between the stress and the heat, the MS has been really acting up, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	I do worry for him.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  He's a good guy.  He still teaches and he's, you know, the [INAUDIBLE], you know, last time he had to teach and he had to go to night meetings.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow, he's busy.
<b>PT:</b>	So he was really tired last night.
<b>DR:</b>	I'll bet, that's a whirlwind day and evening.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, he gets up at 2:00 and then he goes, he prays and he goes to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Then he comes back, then he goes to the next church and opens up—
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	He's just, so naturally at 7:00, 8:00, he's whooped.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure he is.
<b>PT:</b>	After all the pressure of work and everything, you know, he's the assistant warden [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It's hard to believe.
<b>PT:</b>	Even when he's home they'll call at night sometimes but the officer of the week, like if the warden goes out of town, they call in the middle of the night.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He hangs in there, I don't know how but he does.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know how he does it either, all the medication and everything is interesting—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	In terms of his healing process.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think, I think his faith has really kept him going.
<b>DR:</b>	It's been a very important source [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but it's [INAUDIBLE] every Sunday, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, yeah, [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he helps, um, some other lady down there, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's so sweet.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sure he does more than that but he doesn't tell me.
<b>DR:</b>	He's like a big boy scout, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Helping everybody else.
<b>PT:</b>	He takes care of them, [INAUDIBLE], recently they wrote this really nice article about him.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And the company paid for him, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh that's so nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Really nice, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	About how, you know, how fond he is of his church and [INAUDIBLE] and all this stuff, it was real nice.  I sent it to his brother.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I sent a copy to [INAUDIBLE] and I sent it to his kids, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	You could print a copy and put it on the refrigerator—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And hopefully it'll sink in with his son.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	This is how you stay connected to a community—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And become an important part of it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know where [INAUDIBLE], you know, then he'll bring the girlfriend over, she takes a shower—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	He takes a shower.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Nothing worse than walking some, getting up Sunday morning and looking out and she's sitting in my chair.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I just, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Hopefully not wearing your robe.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank God.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just, that's something like every week I do is sit down, read the paper, have my tea and nobody—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, bothers me, oh God.
<b>DR:</b>	And then you have to share the space so closely with somebody.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh the kitchen is so small, you know, you start cooking and it's like you've got to get out of here, it annoys [NAME OTHER] too when he's in there trying to do some because [NAME OTHER] will come busting right in.  You think he could wait till we were done.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, right.
<b>PT:</b>	But no, he's got to start right away and he's got to, he just has no shame and no sense of anything.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't think he thinks about other people, I don't think he really puts himself in their place.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, it's just his impulses acted on and that's it.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I know and he keeps [DEIDENTIFIED] every weekend to the trailer he has.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He pays for that ever month, he pays rent and all that gas to go to [DEIDENTIFIED], then he's got to buy food while he's down there and all, and he can't afford to give us anything.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	You know what I mean, it's just, I just feel like, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he's just not getting it, it's been almost 2 years like you say.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	It might be worth planting the bug in, you know, everybody's ear and just saying, you know, it's been 2 years and these are lean times, Christmas is coming, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It just—
<b>PT:</b>	He don't care.  He has no sense of nothing and he's always telling me stories about, oh you know, next year or whatever when I get a house, when I get this, you can't even afford a freaking apartment—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it doesn't sound like it.
<b>PT:</b>	And he lies so much, that annoys me, oh my God.
<b>DR:</b>	That would drive me crazy too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah, I had to jack off my boss today, he was getting on my nerves, I threw this guy over here, I did that, you know, come on, do I look stupid, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Somehow we doubt this version of the events.
<b>PT:</b>	And he's never, I couldn't [INAUDIBLE], it was like—
<b>DR:</b>	Like it's his personality.
<b>PT:</b>	I met him when he was [AGE] and he's been like that.  [INAUDIBLE] make it where he's the big tough guy.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Time to get his own life, right.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think what I'm going to do is push myself, you know, I'm going to try to really push myself to do the things that, um, even if it's just around the house—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, but I want to get into the gym thing and—
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and then I've got to feel better about myself, you know, it's like, it's like I play this game where I have to earn points or something, you know, and I feel guilty and depressed if I don't, so I create this for myself, you know, but I think, you know, the extra Klonopin, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.
<b>PT:</b>	Once in a while—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, that will hope overcome that morning anxiety about just getting up and getting out, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You want to be able to do that.
<b>PT:</b>	Once I get done and I'm in the car—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's done, I got that far.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been going into work late and leaving early, I've just been awful, you know, I never would do this before, I don't know what it is, I've just to retrain myself or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe you could do 2 shifts at work kind of, because it sounds as though the one big block of time is tough—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	To get it all done but you're, um, sounds like if it was from 8:00 to 2:00—
<b>PT:</b>	Six hours.
<b>DR:</b>	Six hours, so if you went from like 9:00 to noon, took a break, met a friend for lunch, went to the gym, then went from like 2:00 to 5:00 or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't think they'd go for that.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, so there is someone there that would be—
<b>PT:</b>	We've got this new boss—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	That's trying to make a name for herself.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, too bad, because the flexibility might have been nice.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but I do have the day off a week.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	And I usually take that Wednesday which makes the week, like 2 days I work—
<b>DR:</b>	That's not bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Then I'm off and then 2 days and Wednesday is when [NAME OTHER] is over for dinner.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b>	So I get to see him but anymore it's so sad to see him because he's so depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	Poor guy, if he could just find a primary doc who might be able to prescribe the Prozac, you know, he'd be that much further ahead.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] can't afford to go to the doctor right now.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a shame.
<b>PT:</b>	I think that's who gave him the Prozac before.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's what I'm wondering about, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because you didn't mention a psychiatrist or anything and—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, if you have a history and it works, it seems like a reasonable place to start again, especially since it's generic.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I took him when he was younger, when he was in his teens and, you know, the doctor said it was really a bad time to move him from his [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	All that upheaval with [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and blah, blah, blah—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He's got problems so we basically need to [INAUDIBLE], you know, I mean so he was feeling like under pressure there.
<b>DR:</b>	Poor fellow, but you can't know, I mean you just went for the nicest standard of living that you can find.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know and that you can afford.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but I mean, you know, those kids, none of them get cars for their birthday but they have homes and you're talking 15, 18 years ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Back in the day, that was a big deal.
<b>PT:</b>	That was a big deal.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He'd say I'm calling you, he always told me where he was—
<b>DR:</b>	That was good.
<b>PT:</b>	God bless him.  He'd say I'm calling from so and so's car, we're going here or something mom, so I'll be there, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	He probably sounded like a jet setter or something like that.
<b>PT:</b>	He did, he really did.
<b>DR:</b>	Back in the day.
<b>PT:</b>	And I sent him to snowboard camp, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, fun.
<b>PT:</b>	Back then we had more money—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so he did get advantages.
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, $150 [NAME OTHER] sweater, stuff like that, stuff I never had.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I always had the knock offs but apparently, you know, he tells me all the time in a round about way what a bad parent I was, you know, I made it too easy for him, I made it this, I made it that.
<b>DR:</b>	Nobody is perfect.  If he's still alive, you can't have been that bad.
<b>PT:</b>	He's [AGE], I mean get over it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I got over my pain, I mean it still haunts me sometimes but I can't let it ruin my life.
<b>DR:</b>	And there was some big things going on there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	We know that, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean he's never had it like that.
<b>DR:</b>	No, no, definitely not.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's funny, you know, maybe some day when he has children of his own, there's an author named [NAME OTHER] whose father was also a famous author named [NAME OTHER] and a very colorful character in a lot of unusual ways and [NAME OTHER] said once you have your own family, it makes you forgive your parents everything.  Well, that's not 100% true but you sure understand a lot more.
<b>PT:</b>	I think you, well, you know, he says well my kids, if I have them, he said will benefit from what I learned.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, well good, as well it should be and as well everybody hopes that things will be better for their children.
<b>PT:</b>	When he went to college, I thought I did that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, nobody in my family, except my one brother—
<b>DR:</b>	You did do better, that's the thing to look at, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I just, one generation makes the next generation better.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	That's how it should go.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and your son was not mistreated or anything, you know, yeah, I mean maybe we didn't get everything we wanted but we're still here so somebody didn't mess up too badly.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so I try not to dwell on the family—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's no sense, if that's the way you feel, that's the way he feels—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and people do the best they can at the time.  I mean if you were battling depression and other things going on, I mean, at least he wasn't neglected, he wasn't abused—
<b>PT:</b>	Never.
<b>DR:</b>	You weren't abusing substances, I mean there are so many people who are just raised in wretched situations.
<b>PT:</b>	But all he remembers is the bad times when I got [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Breakdowns, he remembers that, you know.  He said to me last night, you basically stopped being a mother when we moved in with [NAME OTHER], you know, when I married [NAME OTHER] and he was like [AGE].  You know, I said that's not true [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	That's really not true.
<b>DR:</b>	You were still there weren't you?
<b>PT:</b>	But I was on disability, I went on disability because I was just between choosing between [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] and it was just such a strain and then I got sick.  I think the whole year that went in between when I had moved in with [NAME OTHER] and then I went back with [NAME OTHER] for a year—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	In that whole year, I think the, uh, stress just killed my [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It's huge, that's a gargantuan stress.
<b>PT:</b>	It was horrible.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was just, it was an awful situation but, um, you know, I probably should think the worst is behind me.
<b>DR:</b>	It probably is
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't have to go through that again and that is very painful.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That is painful and you didn't abandon your son, you know, maybe you weren't 100% emotionally available every moment of every day but that's life, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	He had [NAME OTHER] there too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and a parent who works 2 jobs or a night shift, you know, their children may not see them that much—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	But they're still doing the best they can by them.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I always thought, I tried to have quality time, we'd do something, we'd go to the library—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	We'd go to—
<b>DR:</b>	You might have more fun, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'd play with [NAME OTHER] and, you know, we had a good relationship, it's just now I feel like he wants to blame his whole life on me.
<b>DR:</b>	You've got to emphasize the positive, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I tell him things and he goes mom, don't throw [INAUDIBLE] at me.  I'm like, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The older he gets, the more he sees people who have really had a bad situation, you know, not to say anybody is perfect or to minimize anybody's suffering but there are some sad sad stories out there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, there are, there certainly is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and he still has his parents who love him and he's not going to starve and he's not going to never have a roof over his head as long as there are people watching out for him.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	He can't, at some point he's got to stop using whatever for a crutch.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, you just—
<b>DR:</b>	He's a grown man now too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know—
<b>PT:</b>	He's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	I hope he steps up to the plate soon.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	God forbid if he doesn't, I don't know if he ever will, maybe he'll be like his father and that's awful, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	But you know, he's a caring person, he's got a lot going for him, he's got a lot of you, you know, and being sensitive, being empathetic, that's valuable.
<b>PT:</b>	I think his father not having anything to do with him has a part in how he feels, it would have to.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, I mean he's been so distant and it's just sad because—
<b>PT:</b>	I mean through everything—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I knew he loved him.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] loved by my mom and dad.
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely, but yeah, his father is just, he's just, now that's emotionally unavailable.
<b>PT:</b>	Are you kidding, and I'm afraid like [INAUDIBLE] into him without a trailer.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, his father lives in his trailer—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	He's like a recluse.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so strange.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't understand it at all.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't either.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you ever see the movie Riding In Cars With Boys?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.
<b>DR:</b>	It had [NAME OTHER] in it—
<b>PT:</b>	I remember [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	I think you can get it from [DEIDENTIFIED] and it's a woman who had a similar situation with her husband and a son and she always tried to help the son do better, she had a teenage pregnancy, married the dad, the dad turned to drugs and kind of dropped out of the boys life, so years later, fast forward, she's put herself through college, she wants to publish her memoir and she needs a release of information essentially from the dad and it turns up the dad is living in a trailer and, you know, he has, uh, a wife who's sort of someone who's out for whatever she can get and so they have to go find the dad and, uh, get him to sign a release and the wife is trying to extort money which, you know, [NAME OTHER] doesn't have—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So she ends up sort of stalking off and, uh, throwing the thing in the trash and then, um, the boy is sort of bewildered, he's in his 20's by this point or whatever—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And trying to figure out what to do and the father comes out of the trailer, fishes the thing out of the trash, he signs it, he gives it to the boy and he says look, I never gave you anything but if this book brings something, you know, to yours and her life, you know, you've had a hard time, you know, don't worry about the wife in there, she doesn't have to know a thing, I'm not in this for any money and it was just a very touching—
<b>PT:</b>	Wow.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you know they never had a relationship and, but he sees how the dad is living and he realizes, you know, the guy just didn't have it in him to do it, it wasn't, it wasn't anything mean or spiteful, he just couldn't do it, he just couldn't live that standard or give enough or whatever.
<b>PT:</b>	That's the way his father is, I mean the only thing he ever came to, he never came to any of his games, nothing, he came to his graduation.
<b>DR:</b>	That's something.
<b>PT:</b>	Out at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, I love that place.
<b>PT:</b>	The only time, I mean I walked in, myself and my sister and [NAME OTHER], he goes there's a seat over here and him and his, I guess she's common law wife, they were there but do you believe he didn't hang around to see [NAME OTHER] after the graduation.  He drove all those miles to see him and didn't hang around, what did it mean then.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think he felt ashamed to see him?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes I think he does but then, but how could you hurt the kid like that, to show up and then leave.
<b>DR:</b>	I've never understood that.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean he stayed for the whole thing but then, you know, the kids took a while to get out and everything—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, how about saying I'm proud of you son, that's why I'm here.
<b>PT:</b>	It would have helped, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Write him a letter and hand him the letter if you can't find the words, you know, I don't understand it.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, when he left, like that and I just though, why did you bother, it will hurt him more.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so odd.  He wanted to see me from a distance but he didn't want to see me up close, that's what the kid ends up concluding even though the dad may think, well I made it to the graduation, that's too bad.
<b>PT:</b>	He's brain dead.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, he doesn't get it, there's something fundamental he's not getting.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, he never got it from his parents.
<b>DR:</b>	No.  And yet, you've been a better parent in many ways than yours were.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh God yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You've been more fair and even handed, you know.  You just do the best you can, some day he'll understand better.
<b>PT:</b>	I hope so.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's not to say that anybody ever thinks anybody is perfect, it's not possible to be perfect—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not looking for that, it's just—
<b>DR:</b>	But you did the best you could.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, I recognize you did the best you could.
<b>PT:</b>	That's all I want to know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah and you may have to say that to him at some point, just say, look you know I love you, I did the best I could, I gave you all I could, it's time for you to move on, you're in the driver's seat of your own happiness now, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	I try to say it but I just can't, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like saying, get over it.
<b>DR:</b>	I know.
<b>PT:</b>	But then he says, I'm so depressed, I'm so this, blah, blah, blah—
<b>DR:</b>	And you know, it's not as much get over it as you're in the driver's seat now, okay, if you're depressed, well, you can get a job, you can try to get benefits or at least enough money till you're able—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	To see someone or if you don't get benefits, there are community medical centers, you know, for wherever he is, I work in one—
<b>PT:</b>	Do you?
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and the people I know who work in them are dedicated people, you know, maybe it's hard to find an hour to talk to the doctor there but—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, we still get to know you that first visit and then, you know, if you need to be seen, they'll see you, that's what they're there for, so—
<b>PT:</b>	That's right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so he, he would still have options but he can't just be passive and think life is going to come to him.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think that's—
<b>DR:</b>	You know.
<b>PT:</b>	What he's waiting for, something to just pop up, you know, a big sign, this is what you're supposed to do, you know what I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Turn here and you'll be all right, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Remember that old expression, life is what happens while you're making other plans, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly, exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  What do we got [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let's set another appointment, let's see what we've got.  I'm going to be away the second two weeks of August but we could meet, let's see, do you want to do Tuesday, [DATE] at 10:00?
<b>PT:</b>	That's good.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, let me put you down for that.
<b>PT:</b>	I need a card to remind me.
<b>DR:</b>	You betcha, that's not a problem.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's good because I'll be back on 12:00 to 8:00.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean 12:00 to 6:00.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right, because that's going to be right after Labor Day, yeah, and you'll have time to get there from here and everything, great.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, in the meantime, I'll try the things we talked about.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.

<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Like this little [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, well, I think you've got some good insights and some good thoughts there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know what the problem is, I just have to do something about it.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're already halfway to finding your shorts, that's more than I can say.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, if they still fit when I find them.
<b>DR:</b>	Chances are good they're stretchy.

<b>DR:</b>	So that's always a good thing.
<b>PT:</b>	They're actually mens, Hanes or something.
<b>DR:</b>	I prefer those.

<b>DR:</b>	They're cotton—
<b>PT:</b>	They give—
<b>DR:</b>	They have the drawstring, exactly, it's perfect for the gym, you need something like that.
