<b>The article that follows is part
of the <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin's</i>
ongoing <i>First Person Accounts</i> series.
We hope that mental health
professionals—the Bulletin's primary
audience—will take this
opportunity to learn about the
issues and difficulties confronted
by consumers of mental health
care. In addition, we hope that
these accounts will give patients
and families a better sense of
not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be anticipated
by persons with serious
emotional difficulties. We welcome
other contributions from
patients, ex-patients, or family
members. Our major editorial requirement
is that such contributions
be clearly written and
organized, and that a novel or
unique aspect of schizophrenia
be described, with special
emphasis on points that will be
important for professionals.
Clinicians who see articulate patients,
with experiences they believe
should be shared, might
encourage those patients to submit
their articles to <i>First Person

When I was (age 12), I asked my
parents if I could see a psychiatrist
and they agreed. I asked him
if he thought I might have schizophrenia.
He told me that he
would not make that diagnosis; he
said that schizophrenia caused a
person to have hallucinations and
delusions and that I appeared to
him to be rational. At the time I
had not experienced anything that
I would call a hallucination. I had
intense fears and I was often depressed.
I hated going to school
and made up many excuses to
stay home.


At 15 I began seeing another
psychiatrist at the recommendation
of a school counselor, who had
noticed my strange and reclusive
behavior. The problems I remember
talking about with her were
mostly feelings I had when I was
at school. I felt different and
alone. Seeing so many people in
the school halls made me wonder
how my life could be significant. I
wanted to blend in in the classroom
as though I were a desk. I
never spoke. I didn't participate in
any extracurricular activities or
have any close friends. I loved to
read. I especially enjoyed books
that were not on the curriculum. I
liked to read J.R.R. Tolkien's books
about Middle Earth. I enjoyed
writing papers for my English
classes, but I was not thought of
as an exceptional student.


The high school graduation ceremony
was a painful event for me.
I stood alone and only one girl
came to say goodbye to me. After
graduation I enrolled at a college
near home. I stayed only 2 years.
It was difficult for me to deal
with ordinary situations, such as a
problem with a teacher.


My major was to be in English
with an emphasis on writing. I remember
thinking that I would
make it through all the courses
but when it came time to have
my writing portfolio evaluated (a
graduation requirement) I would
be found lacking in writing ability
and refused a diploma.


I remember those years at college
as a time in which I was

During the summer after my
sophomore year at college my psychiatrist
decided that the drug
haloperidol might help me. I remember
her explaining to me that
if I read about the drug I would
find out that it was used to treat
severely ill people. She said that
she did not regard me as severely
ill, but that the drug would reduce
my fears. However, I remember
that after taking the drug my
fears intensified. I became fearful
of children I saw walking down
the street. I also suffered from uncontrollable
jaw movements until I
was also given another drug to
correct it. The haloperidol had the
effect of making me restless. I
couldn't tolerate the effects it had
on me and I was taken off it. I
stopped going to see the psychiatrist
because I began to doubt that
seeing her would bring me any
relief from the problem of being
myself.


I found a job through an ad in
the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. I settled into
the work. I was regarded as
strange by my supervisors and co-workers,
but I was soon given
more difficult duties because of
my ability and willingness to
work.


I became obsessed with my diet
and wanting to be thin, even
though I had never been overweight.
I began to eat only fruits
and vegetables. I wanted to be
weightless and to float on air,
more like a spirit than a human
being. Because of too much fiber
in my diet, I developed an intestinal
blockage and had to be rushed
to the hospital in excruciating
pain. The doctors in the emergency
room were surprised to see
my skin had turned a deep orange.
It was later concluded that
this was the result of too much
carotene from carrots in my diet.


The resident doctor called a psychiatrist
to see me. He happened
to be the same man who years
earlier had told me I didn't have
the symptoms of schizophrenia.
This time he was called in to determine
whether or not I had
anorexia nervosa. I weighed 84
pounds at this point. He didn't
diagnose me as having anorexia
nervosa. He diagnosed me as having
"avoidant personality disorder"
and as suffering from "anxiety."
The blockage in my intestines
cleared up and I returned to
work.


That summer was a horrible
time. Life took on a hellish quality
that is incomprehensible to the
average normal person. A book I
read at about this time had a profound
effect on me. The book was
<i>Native Son</i> by Richard Wright. I
came to identify strongly with the
main character because I believed
that he and I were both good
people who were just misunderstood
by everyone. His crime, killing
a young woman, seemed logical
to me under his circumstances.
I also enjoyed reading classical literature
such as <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The
Odyssey</i> by Homer.


It is difficult to remember the
progression of my illness chronologically.
The world became a
more chaotic, frightening, and inexplicable
place. I think it must
have been in February 1984 that I
began to have the perception that
my thinking was beginning to
change. It seemed that my mind
had two parts. One part was the
part that had always been there,
but the other part was filled with
voices that talked in the background
of my thoughts. I became
distracted listening to the voices
and found it difficult to concentrate.
As my illness progressed I
couldn't understand what was
happening to me. I would sit at
my desk and listen to the voices.
My life with my family seemed
different. I remember a strange
conversation while sitting in a restaurant
with my parents. My father
said, "Your mother is getting
old." I looked at her and saw that
she was crying. I can only suppose
that she was sad about the
changes in me and didn't know
what she could do.


Going to work was pure hell. I
continued to hear voices. One day
while sitting at my desk I saw a
fly land on my arm. It was the
biggest fly I had ever seen. It
could not have been real, not in
February. One of my duties was
to read information intended for
military personnel. I remember
reading about Hellfire missiles. I
imagined the manmade hellfire
killing people. I became convinced
that I was reading top secret information
and that someone would
try to have me killed so that I
couldn't talk.


Many of the thoughts I had at
this time would seem embarrassing
to me now if I looked at them in
a judgmental way. Some thoughts
seem evil or just petty and childish.
I accept them all the way
most people accept their dreams. I
couldn't control them so I don't
blame myself for any of them.
Only by thinking of them in this
way can I tell the story as I am
doing. I hope that the average
person's understanding of mental
illness will become such that such
episodes will be regarded as altered
states of consciousness and

The morning of the day I had
to be hospitalized I told my
mother that I didn't want to go to
work because someone there
would shoot me. She asked me a
question and I answered in a
rhyming phrase that made no
sense. I left the house without letting
her know and decided that I
would go to work after all. I believed
that I would pass every
person in the world that day and
that each of them would share a
secret with me. I believed that the
gestures of people had a special
significance. This was how they
told me their secrets. When I
heard people talk I thought they
were talking about me. At work I
punched in at the timeclock, oblivious
to the time. It was the middle
of the morning. I sat at my
desk. I don't know if I tried to
work.


Someone came and handed me
a note that said, "Call the doctor."
I saw this note as coming from a
mysterious force that was giving
me directions. I left work and
took the train to see our family
doctor. It was a miracle that I
came to no harm walking around
in the state of mind I was in. I
thought that traffic would automatically
stop for me. Everything
that had cost money I believed
was now free. When I got to the
doctor's office I asked the nurse
why I had been called. She said
that she hadn't called me. I asked
her if she knew who I was. I
wanted her to take control of the
situation and guide me because I
didn't know what was happening.
It seemed that the force had led
me to this point and was abandoning
me.


Fortunately the doctor entered
the room. My mother had called
him earlier that morning and described
my condition. He asked
me to have a seat and left the
room to call my mother to tell her
where I was. It turned out that
she had called my father and he
had come home from work and
they were searching for me. She
had called the place where I
worked to see if I was there and
she had pretended that she was
calling from the doctor's office.
Even though I had developed a
fear of them I went with them
willingly. They put me in the car
and drove me to a hospital. I remember
the nurse in the emergency
room asking me what the
problem was. I started to talk
about something I had read about
Moses and the Ten Commandments.
She asked that I just be
quiet because she didn't understand.
I signed myself in without
realizing I was in a hospital. I
trusted everyone as though I were
a small child. I didn't think of
asking anything, such as how long
I was going to have to stay or
what was going to be done for
me.


My hospital stay lasted 3 weeks.
I was started on medication right
away. I was given haloperidol. I
don't know when the medicine
started having any effect. I wandered
up and down the hall
watching people. I told the nurse
that there was a force leading me
to hell. I had many bizarre delusions.
I believed I was Eva Peron,
the wife of the Argentinian dictator
and the subject of the musical
<i>Evita</i>, which was popular at that
time. I believed that my mother
had died of lung disease from
smoking cigarettes. My heartbeat
became so rapid that I thought I
was in the hospital awaiting a
heart transplant. I thought that a
heart that was pounding so intensely
could surely not last much
longer. I listened to the radio in
my room and interpreted each one
of the lyrics as a message intended
for me.


I believed that it was possible
for a person to leave his or her
body and inhabit the body of another
person. I heard people I
knew speaking through the
mouths of the strangers around
me.


As the weeks passed and the
medication began to take effect,
the world became saner. The
voices stopped. Things started to
seem ordinary. Before releasing me
from the hospital, my parents
were called in for a session with
me, my psychiatrist, and a social
worker. The social worker stressed
the importance of my learning
how to live independently. I decided
that seeing the psychiatrist
was necessary but that seeing the
social worker was an unnecessary
interference in my life. I now regret
that I didn't get the help of a
social worker at that time.


One pleasant aspect of being in
the hospital was that it gave me a
chance to think about what I
really wanted to do with my life.
I no longer wanted to continue
working at a dull job where I was
unhappy. It seemed that there
should be more to life. I had a
catalog from the University of Illinois
at Chicago. I learned that
the university had a classics department.
I wanted to study about
ancient Greece and Rome. I considered
earning an advanced degree
and teaching. My interest in
the classics has been replaced over
the years by stronger interests in
other subjects, but I am glad I
had the interest then to motivate
me.


When I got out of the hospital I
returned to work, or I should say

[p. <i>342</i>]

Nine years have passed since I
was hospitalized. I went on to
earn a bachelor's degree in political
science. I tried to earn a master's
but I found the course work
in library science too difficult.
These 9 years have been filled
with many disappointments. I've
gone through long periods of unemployment.
At 31 I am single
and unable to support myself. I
live with my parents. I am searching
for a job that I will really
enjoy.


Even though I am struggling, I
feel that the worst is behind me
and that the illness will not return.
I regret that I went so long
being ill. The time I lost would
have been better spent having
friends and developing my skills
and talents. I hope that in the future
it will be much easier for a
child or young adult to get help
for emotional problems so that
they do not have to have an experience
similar to mine. As mental
health care is now, people can
go without receiving the treatment
they need until their lives are
devastated.
