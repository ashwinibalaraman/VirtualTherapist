<font size="4"><b>Chapter 2: The Onset of Psychopathological States</b></font>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


What experiences must a person have before he will
say to himself, "I am mad"? Anyone may observe the
behavior or listen to the remarks of another and
privately think to himself, "That man is crazy!" Such
an observation may be a considered judgment, or it
may be a semifacetious bit of byplay, meaning only
that the person in question is somewhat peculiar, at
least from the standpoint of the observer. My present
inquiry is not directed to the question, "Is that man
insane?", but to the question, "What experiences must
a man have before he will say to himself, ‘I am really
losing my mind’ or ‘I must have gone mad’?" It is not
unusual to think that overwhelming emotion, excessive
fatigue, or profound physical illness might lead one
to think, "This is driving me crazy; unless things become
easier, I'll lose my mind." But how does one
recognize that such a change has actually taken
place?


If a person had been ill, lapsed into unconsciousness,
and finally awakened to find himself locked in a
mental hospital, he would necessarily wonder what he

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The behavior or speech that leads others to have a person committed
to an institution or certified as insane are, for the most part, concerned
with threats or attempts that seem to endanger the life and safety
of some person or persons, including the individual in question. Anyone
may exhibit peculiar behavior, express odd ideas, and speak in a queer
fashion, but as long as he does not threaten or attempt to do anything
which may threaten his own safety or that of those about him little is
ordinarily done to restrict his freedom of action. Common sense and
social tolerance hold that almost any sort of peculiar speech or behavior
may occur, but only when such behavior occurs which endangers life or
security does it precipitate social action. In general, present-day society
holds that loss of prudent self-control is the distinguishing mark of insanity.


The convincing realization of one's own madness is to a large extent
conceived in this same general frame of reference. When one says, "I
have lost my self-control; I am no longer master of my own mind" or
"There are strange ideas, experiences and actions that I have and that I
should be able to direct or modify but that I cannot control"; then one
starts doubting one's own sanity.


<i>Effects of the Realization of One's Loss of Self-Control</i>


Any person may have times when he realizes that his mind is confused,
that he is overwhelmed by emotion, or that his thought processes
are not normal. None of these states is pleasant or desirable, yet if in the
background one continues to believe, "I could control myself if I would
only summon my reserve strength," there is no necessary recognition of
the possibility of derangement. Only when one's efforts at maintaining
self-control fail and continue to fail, does the real question of one's sanity
enter into consciousness.


The awareness of losing self-control or the feeling of being a puppet
responding to forces and experiences that one cannot direct or modify is
quickly associated with a variety of acute emotions, particularly with
despair and a growing sense of hopelessness. Beyond the mere recognition
of the lack of self-control, one realizes the implication that this loss may
be, and in all probability is, the loss of sanity. In our social relationships,
we have been taught from childhood that insanity constitutes not only a
human failure but a personal disgrace, and an unwholesome reflection
on the reputation of one's family and even of one's friends. We may also
have been imbued with the idea that insanity is due to sinfulness, evil

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To convey some idea of the devastating effect of the subjective
realization of madness I will cite an account taken from Jane Hillyer's
autobiography, <i>Reluctantly Told</i>. Jane Hillyer was a young school teacher
who became more and more fatigued toward the end of the school year
until she reached the point of physical collapse. She was taken to a
hospital where she became delirious. During one of the first nights in the
hospital, she awakened and stumbled in terror to a mirror where she saw
her image, an episode she later described as follows.


I knew definitely that the figure in the mirror was mad. <i>I</i> was mad. I have
never learned words with which to describe the sensations accompanying that
realization. I seemed dual; struggling against the truth, crying out against fate,
pleading, praying; and at the same time, cool and almost surgical in my analysis
of the situation. I probed to find the cause; I reckoned the factor of fatigue,
long continued fever, strain, tension; I checked my recent behaviour and the
accompanying drives and emotions. Yes, that explained it all. I was mad.
Again I looked at the mirrored figure. It seemed all eyes. I called it by name.
"Do you know," I said, "do you know that you are insane? Do you know what
that means? Do you know they won't trust you any more? They can't. You may
not work in the fall. You will disappoint them all. Do you know what it is like
to be mad? That <i>thing</i> will get stronger and stronger. Some day it will <i>be</i> you.
... If you had listened and rested and stayed out of doors and done the thousand
things they advised, you might not be insane now? ... Every one will
know soon. They will shut you up.... Do you know it's <i>you</i> that's mad, you,
and not any one you are reading about? ... Yes, I know; I know; ... I know
it's me that's mad. (Hillyer, 1926, pp. 14-15)


The desolating effect of such a realization, the critical attitude of the
EDITOR function toward the remainder of the self, the regret at not
having followed advice, and the final admission of failure, all are presented
in sharp focus. In one sense, as long as self-criticism persists, the
patient may legitimately continue to insist that he is not yet completely
insane. But if self-criticism and self-control are both absent, then, at some
later time, the patient can only say, "I must have lost my mind."


<i>Circumstances Commonly Said to Lead to Lunacy</i>


There are several internal and external circumstances that the general
public commonly considers as constituting an adequate basis for
explaining the beginning of a period of mental derangement. It is generally
believed (without too much factual evidence) that physical illness
may so "weaken the mind" that self-control is endangered and may be in

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>PHYSICAL ILLNESS</b>


Since physical illness may involve periods of unconsciousness and
delirium, many afflicted persons consider that the appearance of any
psychopathological disorder is no more than an additional feature of an
existent physical disease. The following account illustrates this point. It
was written in a letter sent to an asylum superintendent by a patient who
had recovered from a mental illness and returned home.


In the fall of 1839, I was much exposed, and laboured exceedingly hard,
which brought on an attack of fever, that seemed to spend its force principally
in my head. I also had a severe cough, and at one time spit blood. As the fever
increased, I experienced a kind of stupor and derangement of mind. In this
state I had the most singular dreams, or visions of things. One peculiar thought
that entered my mind was, that my body was divided into four parts; the legs
being cut off at the knees, and my head and breast severed from the body,
which appeared to me to be real and true; and I suffered great anxiety as to
how the parts of my body should be re-united, and made to grow together
again. A physician was employed, and he ordered plasters to be applied to my
ancles, and a blister to my breast, and one on the top of my head, and gave me
several emetics; and the pain of all these, and the distress of the fever in my
head, was enough to render the strongest man, with the best constitution in the
world, senseless and delirious.


I continued in this condition some time, sometimes pretty sensible, and at
others indifferent to what presented itself before me. At length, through the
advice of some friends, I believe I was taken to your asylum.... At this time,
I entertained the opinion of having just landed in the city of Rome ... I was
induced to entertain the belief of its being a house used by the Roman Catholics
... I thought it was a monastery. I also thought that the land in front of the
building was ... used by them for the interment of the dead.... I thought I
was brought here to be scourged, and taken through purgatory. After that, I
concluded it was a kind of a fort for the protection of the people of the country
... and we were suffering the unpleasant consequences of war.... These,
and a great many other curious and singular notions ... I entertained during
the winter and spring, and until I began to get better. (Anon., 1850a, pp. 472-473)


A similar account of delirium and stupor was written by a young
man who had just finished his college studies and was "in a great anxiety
of mind, and in an unwise melancholy" which he attributed, in part, to

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here I believe my derangement began ... My mind felt an uncommon
shock! I fancied myself at death's door--I called in advisers--I was in a dreadful
state of agitation, but alas! nothing appeased the storm begun. I had been
ordered to lie in bed some days ... I foolishly drought (being deranged) that
if I quitted my bed, I should quit my pains also. The time arrived when I was
to rise, my clothes were placed at hand, I sat up in a pensive mood, and delayed
stirring. The attendant approached and said ... "What John, not stirring, for
shame." ... I made no reply, but fiddled with my clothes, and began to talk
wildly ... I had very strange notions; I thought I had no longer a claim to be
a man, I thought I was big with young pigs--in a word, I thought when I was
getting up, that I was delivered of them.... When I had risen, I was conducted
to an arm chair, and here I had a lucid interval of restored reason....
As soon as I had been up a short time I felt a return of my disorder and I called
aloud for assistance ... They placed the table near me, and on it placed a
pillow, on which I might recline my arm. [I thought that] around me sat some
scholars who seemed to jeer and to talk silently against me; to crack nuts, and
laugh, so that I really believed I had assumed the face of a pig. (Knight, 1827,
pp. 144-146)


Both the preceding accounts agree with the commonly held belief
regarding circumstances that lead to insanity. Prolonged physical and
emotional excitement (here attendant on the death of a parent), induced
physical exhaustion and illness, low despondent spirits, feverish illness,
and unrestrained imagery caused by fever, all are thought to lead to an
"unhinged mind." This notion seems most comprehensible in common
sense. Whether accounts of this sort are factual, or whether they are
"screen memories," following the event of mental derangement, is impossible
to say. (A "screen memory" is a fictional account of circumstances
that may have occurred, but for which no true memory trace remains.)
They do constitute, however, acceptable rationalizations for most persons
and seem to become partial explanations for the afflicted individual. As
long as no one seems to have any certain knowledge with respect to the
real cause of the person's mental illness, any explanation that seems
plausible acts to console, in some part, the overwhelming terror of the
realization, "I am mad" or "I was a lunatic."


<b>FATIGUE AND EXHAUSTION</b>


Other circumstances mentioned by some patients in their description
of the beginning of their madness is excessive fatigue (which sleep and
rest do not allay), increasing fearfulness mixed with melancholia, and
hopelessness. The major complaint is exhaustion and an unfounded sadness
which seems to increase until it is beyond self-control. Some fragments

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the Spring of that year I was tired; quite definitely I knew that. I had
gone through a long period of great strain ... I was tired out, so tired that I
did not seem to be able to make the effort to carry on from day to day. So tired
that there seemed to be no enthusiasm left within me for anything....


That year when we arrived [at our summer home], it was not the same
... But you can't expect a miracle, I thought.... Give yourself time. You'll be
all right in a few days. When you're rested physically then your zest for everything
will be restored. I know now in retrospect that I had already turned off
the broad, sunlit road of my normal life and had taken the first steps along that
tortuous highway [of madness] ... I was heading for that realm of darkness,
that land of half-lights and weird shadows, the world of the mentally ill...


The middle of September came; it was time to close [our summer home]
and to return to the city.... But I could not assemble my thoughts. My mind
would not focus upon the job at hand and I discovered that I lacked the impetus
to get on with it.... I sat down and, without any warning, I burst into
tears.... Depression far deeper and more pronounced than that of the early
summer ... took possession of me. Moreover, the seed of an idea was germinating
in my mind; the hopelessness, the unreasonable quality of it appalled
me....


I knew by this time that my mind was affected and, to me, this was
shameful. It was a bitter disgrace that must be concealed if possible and fought
to the last ditch. If some part of my body had been misbehaving, I would have
gone immediately to the best specialist available. But because my brain was the
offender I could not bring myself to enlist aid from any source.


I had reached the point of knowing that my mind was affected through
a realisation that I was no longer able to make the most trivial decision. Gradually
I was losing the power to direct my mind along straight and logical
channels. Little things which, in the recording of them, appear unimportant
began to assume gigantic proportions because of my inability to handle
them....


I'll fight this thing, I've got to. I'm young; I won't give up. There's never
been anything so far that I couldn't handle in my life and I won't let this get
me. In answer came that other voice within me, that voice that was like an alter
ego and that was becoming so familiar. All right, you've been fighting now for
several months and what have you proved? You're going down and down every
day, slipping away, with nothing to hold on to....


The end came abruptly a week later, a week that bore every characteristic
of a nightmare. Although I still inhabited the world I had always known, my
mind and spirit had definitely crossed the border into that land of unreality, of
shadows in which I was to live for five years....


Henry [my husband] looked at me for a brief second. "Anne, what is it
that you don't want anyone to find out?" "That I'm mad." There, it's out. I've
said it, I thought, through terror and confusion. I've tried not to tell, but I
couldn't hold out any longer. (McCall, 1947, pp. 3-4; 6-7; 10; 11-12; 22; 30)

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There are many similar accounts to the above, which relate how
fatigue, mental confusion, the loss of self-control, feelings of desolation,
the feeling of being out-of-touch with reality, the growth of an unfounded
panic, all lead up to the point of collapse in an undeniable psychosis. As
a usual thing, the patient attributes part of the distress to some physical
weakness or failure, but at the same time, he implies that he is aware that
he is rapidly losing control over his mental processes and that he should
-- but cannot--control his own mind.


<b>PAIN, TENSION AND INSOMNIA</b>


In addition to physical illness and exhaustion, many descriptive
accounts of the beginning of a prolonged abnormal mental experience
tell of unaccustomed painful sensations, feelings of tension, and periods
of insomnia. The sufferer is fully aware of the pain and inner tensions
but cannot convince himself that they constitute a sufficient explanation
for the experiences which follow. In the same way he may complain of
sleeplessness, despite being so physically exhausted that he would
ordinarily have had no difficulty in sleeping soundly. Graves, who was a
very intelligent journalist, described in his extraordinary autobiography,
<i>The Eclipse of a Mind</i>, the onset of the first of his many periods of
overt insanity in the following way.


I began to collapse shamefully under fear and rather real pain. Failing to
sleep one night--my memory is a little obscure as to the details--I experienced
many nervous sensations amounting to pain. I would try to lie down, in a hotel
room or on a boardwalk bench, and find myself dragged up to movement, and
to fear of the causation of these nerve sensations.... It was the first time in my
life that I had encountered the full impact of neurotic sensation. Hitherto in
my life pain--or the approach to pain--had been associated with a definite
physical cause. The habitual reaction was one of looking for causation, and
thereafter removing it.... For a while I simply could not lie still at the onset
of sensations....


In thus describing the neurasthenic sensations which in 1919 bordered on
pain I have already done about the best I can. The single most noticeable effect
among these was a sense of pressure around the head, of weight, of resistance
to any collected attempt to think. Over the body surface I would occasionally
have a sensation as though my structure was inclosed in a straitjacket, and
occasionally on dropping into a doze I would be pulled out of sleep by my own
convulsive movements. My stock of self-control was inadequate to resist the
combination of actual pain and fear about causes. For a period of days, perhaps
weeks, I was simply on the verge of uncontrollable fear....


After dark, the first night on the deserted beach walk, I can remember
arising from bed after failing to go to sleep and walking in the night, occasionally
dog-trotting, with some notion of getting enough physical tiredness to sleep
--and then would draw another white night. The insomnia was the chief symptom
which scared me out of my senses. The iron-cap-around-the-head sensation,

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In essence, the experience described by Graves was a "neurotic"
or obscure sensation of pain, coupled with tension and unreasonable
fear. The sleeplessness, when physical fatigue should have led to sleep,
and the realization that his usual self-control had ceased to function
drove him to what he termed "hysteria." The associated mental confusion,
unclear memory, and rather senseless behavior seemed to him,
later, to be secondary.


A more succinct account of a similar pain-tension-sleeplessness
experience, likewise preceding an insane episode, was published in the
same hospital report from which the excerpt relating to physical illness
was drawn. It was written by the wife of a frontier farmer, to whom she
was devoted. Her husband, she relates, had injured his shoulder, so that
she was at that time working with him in the fields, assisting in clearing
the land. She goes on to say that the onset of her illness was very sudden.


On a certain day, while engaged in the field, I was suddenly struck almost
blind, and felt an uncommon stiffness in the back of my neck, accompanied with
a drawing down of the skin over my eyes and forehead, and the sensation of
tight cords passing through my head. It was some time before I felt able to
return to the house, and attend to my domestic duties. I had lost much sleep for
two or three weeks previous to this attack, and felt troubled in my mind on
account of our difficulties in getting along in the world. On the following night
I was greatly distressed, and thought somebody was coming to kill me. I could
not go to sleep, and, by morning, I believe I was completely deranged. I continued
out of my head for three or four months, and suffered much distress and
anxiety of mind, from the apprehension that I was to be killed. (Anon., 1850a,
pp. 465-466)


In this instance, though the first symptoms might suggest the possibility
of sunstroke, the ensuing events were in no way associated with
sunstroke. The pain-tension-sleeplessness picture was of the nature that
is often typical of the onset of insanity. The main value of this description
lies in the fact that it was furnished by an uneducated, simple-minded
woman who realized the existence of her derangement and was later able
to recall some of the details relevant to the beginning of her illness.


The circumstances that are commonly said to precede an episode of
mental derangement, namely, physical illness, fatigue, and exhaustion, or
pain, tension, and insomnia, may very well represent the preliminary
conditions that occur before any actual psychopathological symptoms become
apparent. But there is no good or convincing evidence that these
circumstances, of themselves, either <i>cause</i> or are the <i>necessary</i> forerunners
of mental derangement.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Prominent Complaints and Conditions at the Onset</i>


Not all psychopathological episodes are alike in their qualitative,
quantitative, or temporal aspects. However, they are similar in that most
mental patients in describing the beginning of their illness complain of
having been overwhelmed by peculiar unpleasant feelings which they
could no longer control and which seemed to them to be unreasonable,
without an adequate basis in known fact. Such unpleasant inner states
may begin slowly or the inner state may spring up quite suddenly.


<b>GRADUAL VS SUDDEN ONSET</b>


In the citations I have given thus far, the symptoms leading to the
breaking point, as related by Jane Hillyer and Lenore McCall, were part
of a gradual process, extending over several months; on the other hand,
the onset of the derangement of the frontier farm wife, as well as that of
the university student, was sudden.


Paul Hackett, whose autobiography, <i>The Cardboard Giants</i>, very
vividly tells of his derangement, suffered from an acute episode that led
to his hospitalization, for a period of several years. He tells in his book
that the central fear during his derangement was the idea that all the
world, including himself, was under the control of an evil power, the
<i>Mind</i>. In retrospect, it seemed to him that this evil had been in the background
of his awareness for many years, though only occasionally did the
specific idea become acute.


I tried to remember when I first knew the world was controlled by this
evil force, the Mind, but I could not remember. It may have been when I was
little, watching bright-colored leaves bum and smoke, or it might have been
when I watched so many close to me die and heard the shovels of wet dirt
striking on the coffins, or it might have been when I watched myself from a
height doing evil when I meant to do good. When it started, I could not remember.
I remembered only that my knowledge meant that the evil force would
destroy me and mine and that I was near the end; that for years I had been
pitched beyond pitch of anxiety and dread and fear, and that I now felt the
pain exploding in my head and the dull grip of pain in the back of my neck,
and that I could not fight any longer, or watch any longer, or hope any longer.
... I let down my guard and slept. The Mind could have struck at me. The fear
and terror washed over me like a wave. ... I had the sensation of falling and
something of walking in a dark room.... I let myself fall. (Hackett, 1952, pp.
4-5)


Insofar as he was personally concerned, the <i>evil Mind</i> did finally
overwhelm him. Despite occasional periods of lucidity when he felt he
had partially regained his self-control, he realized that he had become
insane, even though, at first, he was quite disoriented and not fully aware
of that which had happened to him.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In contrast to Hackett's experience of gradually being overwhelmed
by an outside evil influence, the following account describes a more
sudden and dramatic onset of abnormality. This account is taken from the
autobiography, <i>The Life of the Rev. Mr. Geo. Trosse</i>, published in 1714.
Trosse related that he was the son of well-to-do parents who had indentured
him to several business concerns during his early manhood.
During his indenture, he said, he learned little and became to some
degree a drunkard and a wastrel. Finally, on one occasion, having arrived
at the city of Exeter, he endorsed a note of a certain Major against
the advice of his family. Somewhat disturbed by his foolish action, he
drank heavily before retiring for the night in a room at the local tavern.


I then waking, and being alone in the Chamber, fancy'd I heard some
<i>rushing kind of Noise</i>, and discern'd something at the <i>Bed's-Foot</i> like a <i>Shadow</i>;
which I apprehended to have been a <i>Spirit</i>. Hereupon, I was seiz'd with <i>great
Fear</i> and <i>Trembling</i>, rose in Haste, went forth into the <i>Outer-Chamber</i> in <i>great
Consternation</i>, and walk'd up and down in it as one <i>amaz'd</i>.... The <i>Devil</i>, who
in our Blindness and Presumption hurries us upon <i>rash</i> and foolish <i>Actions</i>,
knows how in a Time of <i>Trouble</i> to set them home, with such Aggravations, as
utterly to sink &amp; distract us.


While I was thus walking up and down, hurried with these worldly disquieting
Thoughts, I perceiv'd a <i>Voice</i> (<i>I heard it plainly</i>) saying unto me, <i>Who
art thou?</i> Which, knowing it could be the Voice of <i>no Mortal</i>, I concluded was
the <i>Voice of GOD</i>, and with Tears, as I remember, reply'd, <i>I am a very great
Sinner, LORD!</i> Hereupon, I withdrew again into the <i>Inner-Room</i>, securing and
barring the Door upon me, I betook my self to a <i>very proper</i> and <i>seasonable
Duty</i>, namely, <i>Secret Prayer</i>; performing it with some kind of <i>Conscience</i> towards
<i>GOD</i>, and with Hopes to receive some <i>Good</i> at his Hands, (which I
<i>never</i> did all my Life-time <i>before</i>). But it was an <i>impudent</i> and <i>proud Prayer:</i>
For I <i>pray'd</i> in <i>my own Strength</i>...


For while I was praying upon my Knees, I heard a Voice, as I fancy'd,
as it were just behind me, saying, <i>Yet more humble; Yet more humble</i>; with
some Continuance. And not knowing the Meaning of the <i>Voice</i>, but undoubtedly
concluding it came from GOD, I endeavour'd to comply with it. Considering
that I kneel'd upon something, I remov'd it; and then I had some
kind of Intimation given me, that that was what was requir'd. Thus I kneel'd
upon the Ground: But the <i>Voice</i> still continu'd, <i>Yet more humble; Yet more
humble</i>. In Compliance with it I proceeded to pluck down my <i>Stockings</i>, and to
kneel upon my bare <i>Knees:</i> But the same <i>awful Voice</i> still sounding in mine
Ears, I proceeded to pull off my <i>Stockings</i>, and then my <i>Hose</i>, and my <i>Doublet</i>;
and as I was thus uncloathing my self, I had a strong internal Impression, that
all was well done, and a full Compliance with the Design of the <i>Voice</i>....


At length, standing up before the Window, I either <i>heard a Voice</i>, which
bid me, or <i>had a strong Impulse</i>, which excited me, to <i>cut off my Hair</i>; to which
I reply'd, <i>I have no Scissors</i>. It was then hinted, that <i>a Knife would do it</i>; but
I answer'd, <i>I have none</i>. Had I had one, I verily believe, this <i>Voice</i> would have
gone from my <i>Hair</i> to my <i>Throat</i>, and have commanded me to <i>cut it:</i> For I

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Seemingly, this experience started suddenly. In such circumstances,
the uncertainty of the individual as to whether it is the voice of God or
of the Devil is not uncommon. But some of the phrases Trosse used in
this account are worth noting, since similar expressions appear often in
the descriptions of psychopathological experience. For example: "rushing
kind of noise," "seized with great fear," "a voice (I heard it plainly),"
"then I had some kind of intimation," "it was then hinted," and so forth,
are typical of the way in which many patients attempt to give verbal
expression to their unusual inner experience.


Whether the beginning of a psychotic episode, like that of Trosse,
is attributed by the patient to the action of good or evil influences depends
both on the nature of the inner experience and on the attendant circumstances.
If the experience is one of fear, or if it is intimated that the
hallucinatory voice is that of a Devil, or if the surrounding circumstances
have no elements suggestive of good, then the sufferer may at once conclude
that he has become the victim of evil forces.


When reading an account such as this, one usually wonders why the
sufferer so unquestioningly obeyed the "imaginary" orders and commands.
Trosse said that he had been a wastrel, irreligious, self-willed,
and disrespectful of authority; yet when voices and ideas were thrust
upon him, though he was uncertain as to their angelic or demoniacal
source, he complied with their orders and without question. Furthermore,
he notes that had he possessed a knife, he would probably have
cut his throat. The oddity of these sudden experiences is the unquestioning
submission of the individual to commands or suggestions that are
subjectively experienced as coming from without.


<b>FEAR</b>


Simple <i>uncomplicated</i> feelings of fear or anxiety, occurring as the
first or leading complaint at the very beginning of a psychopathological
episode, are not common. Only those persons whose accounts are usually
labeled as phobic neuroses dwell on fear as their primary complaint. In
<i>The Autobiography of David</i>----, the author, who suffered for many
years from an acute and disabling agoraphobia (fear of open places),
gives a good description of this particular type of simple fear.


But it was in Arran, according to my sisters, that I first showed signs of
a fear of open spaces. I was going through a field with two white horses in it
and became so frightened of the open space that I had to be picked up and
carried across it. But on this occasion, no doubt, it was the horses which made
me afraid rather than the space itself. The first real attack occured some time
later. I was trying to climb Ben Vahren, and halfway up I was suddenly seized

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whether slight or severe, the fear that accompanies the beginning
of a mental breakdown is usually complicated by feelings of depression,
unreality, ideas of persecution, and the like. For example, a certain
patient cited by Rychlinski said that his abnormality began when he was
a college student living in a city away from home. He was informed of
his mother's sudden death, and being summoned home, he started his
journey by railway coach. He was calm at first, but suddenly an idea
came to him that he might catch a cold. He then thought that a cold
might provoke a mental illness of the particular variety to which his
family was prone. He tried at first to divert such thoughts by reading a
newspaper.


While I read I also looked at my travelling companions in the car and
was especially struck by the presence of two passengers with iron poles, for it
appeared to me that they were watching me. I made an effort not to yield to
the fear to which I succumbed upon seeing the two unknown passengers, by
directing my attention solely to the newspaper, but it was useless... my
thoughts were occupied with something entirely different and with such tension
that I began to reflect about how far my thoughts would be able to reach if
they were not subdued by reason; from this the thought came to me how
frightfully large and powerful are the questions which disquiet man.... The
thought about an abnormality of my mind flashed before me several times; I
fought with the ghost of an illness which I feared; calling my whole will power
for aid. I wanted to ask passing people for a way in which I could meet my
new misfortune. The optical illusions persecuted me.... The facial expressions
of the people involved took on a horrible form; it appeared to me as if I saw
ghosts who stray about with pale, pale yellow and lire-red faces; it appeared
to me, that I was surrounded by persons who have arisen from the grave, that
in movement their lips assumed an oblong shape; that the space of their
mouths represented a dark gorge, which had something demonically-devilish
about it. Since I was inclined to believe in the actuality of these hallucinations,
I assumed then that I also did not live any longer, and that I had found myself
in the other world. (Rychlinski, 1896, pp. 628-630)

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The panic and illusions overcame him so quickly that he lost
consciousness. The next thing he recalled was being aroused when the
train reached a railway station where he was to change trains. The panic,
delusions, and lapses of consciousness continued over several days, and
he was finally committed to a mental hospital by the authorities.


Note the difference between the roles of fear at the onset of this
disturbance and in the accounts given by David. For David, fear first
overwhelmed him as a pure panic state with no real justification or
logical reason; for the student the account indicates that a panic started
that seemed at the time to be partly justified by the attendant circumstances
and by his knowledge of his hereditary predisposition.


<b>MELANCHOLIA</b>


In most of the autobiographical descriptions cited so far concerning
the beginning of a mental episode, mention has been made of a pervasive
feeling of despair and loss of hope; in short, feelings akin to melancholia.
The account of Lenore McCall may be called to mind. Her melancholic
experiences were marked by a growing sense of hopelessness and desolation,
which persisted in spite of all her efforts to gain control of her painful
experiences by seeking new interests and activities. It will be recalled
that in other descriptions each individual seemed to realize the lack of
an adequate basis for his unusual feelings and behavior, but could not
achieve control of his thoughts and feelings. Almost every patient
emphasizes this feeling of hopelessness as a primary disturbance. However,
close scrutiny of the accounts indicates that the feelings became
truly unusual or abnormal only when the patient realized that the experience
had passed beyond his self-control.


An illustrative description of a sudden onset of melancholia has
been selected from <i>The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford</i>. He said that
he had hitherto been a normal young man when the episode occurred.


Towards morning I got into bed, but not to sleep; and when the dull day-light
of Monday came, all support had vanished, and I seemed to be sinking
into a bottomless abyss. I became gradually worse ... and my melancholy took
a fixed form. I got a notion into my head that my brain was failing, and this
was my first acquaintance with that most awful malady, hypochondria. I did
not know then what I know now, although I only half believe it practically,
that this fixity of form is a frequent symptom of the disease, and that the
general weakness manifests itself in a determinate horror, which gradually
fades with returning health. For months--many months, this dreadful conviction
of coming idiocy or insanity lay upon me like some poisonous reptile with
its fangs driven into my very marrow, so that I could not shake it off. It went
with me wherever I went, it got up with me in the morning, walked with me all
day, and lay down with me at night. I managed somehow or other to do my
work, but I prayed incessantly for death; and to such a state was I reduced that

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In this account the experience was one of being overwhelmed by
lethargy and feelings of hopeless despair, so much so that there seemed
no point in the person's attempting to summon his reserve strength so
that he might fight what he felt was a hopeless battle. The melancholic
man is quite unable to <i>will</i> any quality of hope back into his mind; in
this inability lies the core of his distress.


In essence, melancholia and phobia are feeling states that seem to
have no necessary essential external reference. Both states are experienced
as having some <i>future</i> temporal reference, rather than being concerned
with either the present or the past. The core of both experiences seems
to arise from within the body itself, in the same sense that a blush arises
from within. Either condition is commonly dealt with as one which would
be more comfortable if only circumstances would permit some reasonable
explanation for its presence. The mark of abnormality lies in the fact that
these feelings cannot be controlled or diverted. Hence the sufferer says
to himself, "Something has happened inside my mind; it is not essentially
related to the outside world; I know I should be able to drive such
thoughts and feelings out of my mind, but this I cannot do."


<b>FEELING OF BEING UNDER OUTSIDE CONTROL</b>


This disturbance consists of a feeling or conviction of having been
thrust, either gradually or suddenly, under the sway of unknown and
unnatural outside influences. The individual loses control over his
thoughts, together with his usual ability to recognize the direction of
his mental processes. The sufferer may even feel that he has lost his own
personality, as well as the hitherto taken-for-granted capacity to channel
his thinking appropriately. This commanding external influence may appear
to be good or evil, angelic or demoniacal, personal or impersonal,
specific or cosmic. In addition to its general imperative quality, its
potency may extend to affect the person's plasticity of thought, sometimes
so completely that the ordinary course of thought becomes impossible.
The realization that he is no longer a free agent with normal
self-control and self-responsibility is so confusing and unreal that the
sufferer may quite quickly become aware of his disability, but will only
occasionally conclude, "I am mad."


<b>DIVINE POWER</b> The way in which the feeling of becoming controlled
by a Divine Power can lead to irrational self-surrender is aptly
illustrated by the following portion of a transcript of a conversation
between Boisen, a hospital chaplain, and a patient. The patient's monologue
relates to events which led to his first hospitalization.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I must give it to you in order. You can't understand unless we go back to
the beginning 13 years ago. You must know how the whole thing started, how
I made a sort of bet with God.


I was at a Socialist meeting one night. A man there spoke of Jesus and of
his giving his life for others. He asked if there were not many others who
would be willing to do that.


That night I was thinking about what the Socialist speaker said and that
I would gladly give my life for my family alone. In the night I was waked up
and a voice said, "You must be put to the test to see if you will really give up
your life." It seemed as though God were right in front of me and the voice
seemed to be God's voice, and words from the Bible came into my head. I
began to feel very nervous. It seemed as though something was getting into me.
I did not tell my wife. I felt she would not understand. I got up and ran out
into the street in my underwear. Of course, that was a very strange thing to do,
but it was just like the old Greek who found out how to weigh a ship. He was
in his bathtub at the time the idea came to him, but he got so excited that he
got up and ran out without anything on. You get an idea so big it just carries
you away ...


About a week after that I was sent to the hospital. After that dream I
was nervous. I had a feeling like when they bind up your arm and give you a
blood test. I was sort of filled up. It was a queer feeling--something you don't
understand what it is. I had the feeling that there were two sides and that I
had to go to one side or the other in order to get salvation. (Boisen, 1947,
p. 160)


It is worth noting that in this account and in many other similar
ones the experiences seem to the patient to be only partially related to
his previous thoughts and life history. Patients who come under an outside
influence say that they "became thoughtful" and then subsequently
feel that they are being directed or controlled by some outside force;
voices and visions may occur, and though they <i>know</i> that the voices or
visions may be unreal, they never doubt the orders but obey without
question. Even after recovery it is rare for such a patient to doubt the
verity of the occurrence or the unique meaning of his experience. Their
interpretation of the meaning of the event is not that of having lost their
mind, but rather of having been chosen for some divine mission. This
revelation usually carries with it an unshakable conviction of the truth
of the experience, a conviction that may continue for the remainder of
their lives.


<b>EVIL OR DEMONIACAL POWER</b> An instance of demoniacal influence
was related by the writer of an anonymous letter to the editor of a journal,
giving the details of the beginning of his auditory hallucinations, which he
was sure constituted the work of the Devil.


As I was taking a quiet walk one evening about six years ago, in the out-skirts
of the metropolis, I suddenly experienced the sensations of the sound of
apparently human voices. There was no human being on the spot, but as the

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These demoniacal voices continued to disturb him for over six years.
They were so demanding and omnipresent that he was forced to retire
from his occupation. They did not gain full control of his behavior so that
he was never adjudged insane, nor did he ever consider that he had lost
his mind, despite his inability to control the intrusive ideas. In the letter
he also said that after approximately seven years the voices quieted down
so that they could be ignored, but he remained convinced that he suffered
from demoniacal possession.


<b>COSMIC INFLUENCES</b> Another variety of the experience of an over-powering
outside force directing thoughts and actions is the belief that
one has somehow come into possession of a vast amount of knowledge
of the Universe and its meaning--the feeling of having achieved "cosmic
consciousness." This experience usually sets in rather suddenly and carries
with it an unquestionable conviction that in some mysterious fashion
one has been given the key to all Divine knowledge of the meaning of
Heaven and life. On the person's shoulders is usually placed the responsibility
of his own salvation and the salvation of his family, his group, his
nation, in fact all mankind. He may suddenly conceive that, in one way
or another, he has come into possession of a full understanding of the
world and its meaning; that somehow the key to universal understanding
has become available to him.


In a more sophisticated person, the onset of this experience is
similar to the one described in the following account, written by a
psychiatric social service worker:
<blockquote>
<p>
A few weeks before my illness I began to regress into success daydreams
somewhat similar to, though not quite as naive and grandiose, as those I had
had during early adolescence. I was puzzled by this tendency, though not
</p><p>[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
greatly alarmed because it hardly seemed that my daydreaming self was a part
of my adult ethical self. At the onset of panic, I was suddenly confronted with
an overwhelming conviction that I had discovered the secrets of the universe,
which were being rapidly made plain with incredible lucidity. The truths discovered
seemed to be known immediately and directly, with absolute certainty.
I had no sense of doubt or awareness of the possibility of doubt. In spite of
former atheism and strong anti-religious sentiments, I was suddenly convinced
that it was possible to prove rationally the existence of God. (Anon., 1955,
p. 679)
</blockquote>

A few weeks before my illness I began to regress into success daydreams
somewhat similar to, though not quite as naive and grandiose, as those I had
had during early adolescence. I was puzzled by this tendency, though not

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When this occurred she said that she began to write, in a compulsive
fashion, an essay on cognition. After her recovery from the psychosis, she
found parts of the essay among her notes. Some portions of the essay
were quite lucid, while other parts were incoherent and full of symbolic
sexual content. Her cosmic thoughts quickly developed into the idea that
she had an exclusive religious mission to accomplish, and although she
struggled consciously against these overwhelming Messianic delusions,
she continued to have a feeling of burdensome responsibility for the
world, which persisted throughout the entire period of her illness.


The phenomenon of firm belief in the subjective experience of
divine revelation of all knowledge can also manifest itself in persons who
are in no sense insane. For example, about a century ago, when chloroform
and ether were first introduced, a great deal of "social" experimentation
took place and records of their occasional odd effects on some normal
persons reached publication. The English poet Symonds reported his experience
during and following chloroform anesthesia. He was so moved
that he published a pamphlet on the subject. This was included in his
biography, from which the following excerpt has been taken.


After me choking and stifling of the chloroform had passed away, I
seemed at first in a state of utter blankness: then came flashes of intense light,
alternating with blackness, and with a keen vision of what was going on in the
room round me, but no sensation of touch. I thought that I was near death;
when, suddenly, my soul became aware of God, who was manifestly dealing
with me, handling me, so to speak, in an intense personal present reality. I felt
Him streaming in like light upon me, and heard Him saying in no language, but
as hands touch hands and communicate sensation, "I led you. I guided you;
you will never sin, and weep, and wail in madness any more; for now, you
have seen me." My whole consciousness seemed brought into one point of
absolute conviction; the independence of my mind from my body was proved
by the phenomena of this acute sensibility to spiritual facts, this utter deadness
of the senses; Life and Death seemed mere names, for what was there then but
my soul and God, two indestructible existences in close relation. I could reason
a little, to this extent that I said: "Some have said they were convinced by
miracles and spirit-rapping, but my conviction is a real new sense." I also felt
God saying, "I have suffered you to feel sin and madness, to ache and be
abandoned, in order that now you might know and gladly greet Me. Did you

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This description is qualitatively very similar to some which have
been written by mental patients or, indeed, to some of the revelations of
cosmic consciousness recorded by religious mystics. Symonds had experienced
mystical states during adolescence and early manhood, but maintained
that they were neither as vivid nor as detailed as the one released
by the anesthesia.


<b>OUTSIDE PERSECUTORY POWER</b> Ideas of persecution, usually expressed
by an inner compulsion to fight back and conquer the persecutor,
constitute one of the main characteristics of the condition of <i>paranoia</i>.
They are, however, not restricted to this particular diagnostic category.
Persecutory delusions are not infrequent phenomena and are associated
with a wide range of mental abnormalities. Generally speaking, these feelings
of being persecuted are not prominent at the beginning of a mental
breakdown, but more commonly developed during the course of illness.
Examples of a very rapid onset of this state can be found, the rapidity
indicating that such systems may at times occur and develop in an independent
fashion. For example, Dr. K. A. Menninger published the
account of a patient who wrote as follows.


I knew it for seven or eight months before it came. I felt this thing coming
on. The first thing I noticed was when I was shopping I had a feeling as if
everything was leaving me including my mind. <i>I began to think that the world
was against me and I was losing out everywhere</i>. I began to think my husband
was unfaithful, that he was being taken away or that he was going to leave me,
that he was lying to me and that they were all in a gigantic plot against me.


All the time I was scared to death they would find out. I would be
deluded like that for a time and then at another time I would be aware of the
fact that it was false but then I was so terrified with the thought of losing my
mind that I could think of nothing else....


People noticed that I didn't talk plain. They frequently spoke of it, but
I tried to hide it and tell them that they were mistaken. I really noticed it myself,
however, and that it was another sign that my mind was going. Throughout
these six or eight months things grew more and more muddled, but every day
I had the terrible fear which I supposed was the realization that I was losing my
mind and that sooner or later it would be found out. Why, one day when I got

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then I was really changing so in disposition. I was unkind to everyone,
irritable, disagreeable, no love in my heart--why, I wasn't even civil. The
last night, I remember, before everything went black, during the episode when
I thought I had been struck on the head--it was as if someone had given me
a blow with a club in the back of my head and after that I can remember
nothing definitely until everything suddenly got clear on the day I came home
from the hospital. (Menninger, 1924, p. 30)


It should be noted that this patient emphasized the fact that while
she was shopping she "began to think that the world was against me."
She stated that the sense of being the object of persecution started suddenly,
without a period of prior development. I have found accounts
written by other patients who have made similar statements.


Ideas of persecution differ from the phobias and melancholias, in
that they seem to carry an immediate outside reference, usually expressed
by some direct statement as, "People are talking about me." One may be
possessed by fear or hopelessness without having anything, or anyone,
to which the fear or despair is necessarily related. Emotionally, the feeling
of being persecuted seems to carry with it an essence of compulsion
directed against someone or something. It is not a floating state of anger
without any immediate external reference. Originally, the feeling of
persecution may not be specifically directed, leaving some existing doubt
as to the certainty of its truth. However, this period of doubt is short-lived,
and soon thereafter the patient can no longer entertain any doubt
about the essential truth of the persecutory delusions. No further objective
evidence will shake his certainty. The firm inner belief in the
delusion is just as complete and sincere as is the inner conviction of the
truth of religious conversion.


<i>Phenomena That Are Especially Disturbing</i>


The preceding section dealt with the more prominent complaints
and conditions that occur at the beginning of a psychotic attack. We pass
on now to several additional phenomena that are of themselves not
specific to a particular pattern of derangement, but that quite frequently
occur and are very distressing to the patient.


<b>HALLUCINATIONS</b>


Unusual feeling states for which the patient finds difficulty in
evincing an adequate cause and which fail to yield to ordinary methods
of self-control are always disturbing. When the world about one begins to
provide auditory or visual experiences that no one else can hear or see,
and for which all the guiding standards of everyday life provide few, if

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, to suddenly <i>hear</i> a clear voice distinctly speaking in a
sensible fashion, when no one is present, or <i>meet</i> a stranger with whom
one has a sensible conversation and then to see that stranger disappear
into thin air before one's very eyes, are occasions directly contrary to
ordinary perceptual experience. Such experiences may lead to an immediate
doubt of one's own sanity. This type of hallucinatory phenomena
may be illustrated by the following citation taken from L. M. Jayson's
<i>Mania</i>. It is in no way an unusual description to find in the autobiographies
of the insane.


Seated on a steamer chair on the boardwalk of Coney Island, I heard the
voice for the first time. It was, I remember distinctly, a rough, deep bass voice
that did not belong to my brother who was sitting quietly in the chair next to
mine, nor to the middle-aged gentleman with whom I'd just picked up a talking
acquaintance.


It was a voice without any body at all. But it was as positive and persistent
as any voice I had ever heard. It said slowly, "Jayson, you are worthless.
You've never been useful, and you've never been any good."


I shook my head, unbelievingly, trying to drive out the sound of the
words, and as if I had heard nothing, continued to talk with my neighbor.


"You know," I said to him, in what I tried to make an off-hand manner,
"it's a funny thing how many prescriptions you can get from people about curing
the blues and how little any of them help."...


He was nodding sympathetically, and I remember thinking it funny how
blurred and misty his face looked--as if it were miles off--when suddenly,
clearer, deeper, and even louder than before, the deep voice came at me again,
right in my ear this time, and getting me tight and shivery inside.


"Larry Jayson, I told you before you weren't any good. Why are you
sitting here making believe you're as good as any one else when you're not?
Whom are you fooling?"


The sounds were so clear and so loud, I knew that pretty soon the people
next to me would hear them. So I got up, and started walking slowly away,
down the stairs of the boardwalk to the stretch of sand below ... I waited
until the voice came back, the words pounding in this time, not the way you
hear any words, but deeper, as though all parts of me had become ears, with
my fingers hearing the words, and my legs, and my head, too.



[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jayson did walk on into the ocean, beyond his depth, and then
struggled against the lifeguards who came to his rescue. They turned him
over to the police, who, in turn, took him to the psychiatric division of a
large hospital.


Notice that the voice was perceived as clear and distinct, outside
the hearer and disembodied (that is, he did not see anyone, he only
heard a voice). What he heard were orders that admitted no argument.
Further, he heard not only with his ears, but with his entire body. He <i>had</i>
to obey the voice. When such an experience occurs the hearer is overwhelmed
and usually obeys without question. Jayson's experience was
very similar to that of the Rev. Mr. Trosse, whose account I cited earlier.


At the onset of mental derangement the hearing of voices is a more
common experience than the seeing of visions. Man is fundamentally a
"visual" animal, that is to say visual experience is prepotent among the
sensory qualities. For this reason most persons are able to experience
visual illusions with somewhat flexible mental mechanisms that permit
their thought processes to compensate, after a fashion, for most visual
distortions. For this reason, if for no other, visions are not as disturbing
to most individuals as are voices. Usually, visions are reported as having
something of a dreamlike quality, which is, of itself, not too frightening.
An example, written by Winkler's patient, Kubin, may aid in clarifying
this point.


With still a heavy heart I roamed about the town and in the evening
entered a variety show because I was looking for an indifferent and yet noisy
environment in order to equalize an <i>inner pressure</i> which became steadily
stronger. There, something psychically very unusual and decisive for me happened,
which even today I don't completely understand, although I have
thought about it a great deal. Namely, as the small orchestra began to play, my
whole surroundings suddenly appeared to be <i>clearer</i> and <i>sharper</i>, as if seen in
another light. In the faces of those sitting around me I suddenly saw peculiar
<i>animal-human</i> qualities; all sounds were singularly strange, separated from
their cause; it sounded to me like a scornful, groaning, droning common language,
which I could not understand but which still clearly seemed to have a
<i>ghostly</i> inner meaning.... And then, suddenly, I was overcome by a whole
<i>cascade of visions</i> of black and white pictures--one cannot depict the <i>thousand-fold
riches</i> with which my imagination dazzled my eyes. I quickly left the
theatre because the music and the many lights now disturbed me. I strayed
aimlessly through the dark streets and was thereby <i>overcome</i>, being plainly
assaulted by a dark power which conjured up strange animals, houses, landscapes,
grotesque and frightful situations in my mind. I felt <i>indescribably well
and uplifted in my enchanted world</i> and when I became tired I entered a small

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many accounts of the experiences at the beginning of a derangement
such as the above, emphasize auditory disorders and the over-all
unpleasant feeling state. The patient, Kubin, seems to have been more
impressed by the perceived visual changes, and yet said that he felt
strangely well and uplifted. Both the sounds and sights seemed unreal,
but for some reason he was not particularly frightened.


Auditory hallucinations may be accompanied by the perception of
visual images, so that we often find a patient relating how he held a
conversation with a person whom no one else ever saw. The following
dialogue which Davidson held with a stranger, in fact, constituted the
onset of the first abnormal mental episode he experienced. In his autobiography,
<i>Remembrances of a Religio-Maniac</i>, from which we will quote
repeatedly, he told how, on a particular day while playing tennis, he had
left the court to retrieve some stray balls that had gone into a neighboring
field. At the gate just outside the court, he met a man, a stranger,
who said he was a doctor. They introduced themselves and held several
minutes of quite meaningful conversation, finally shaking hands when
they parted. Davidson then collected the tennis balls and started back
toward the court.


After I had retraced my steps a short distance, I turned round, as one
often will, in order to have another look at a person who has impressed one
greatly. I had just noticed that the stranger's shoulders were particularly
square, and that he held himself straight and well, when he turned quickly
towards his left, sprang off the ground into the air, and was gone, almost as if
he had flown in pieces. The impression made upon me for the second was that
he had deliberately sprung upwards into something that immediately hid him
from view, like a diver diving into water, not at all like smoke vanishing into
air, and I confess that for an instant the thing looked uncanny, almost diabolical.
I looked carefully rubbed my eyes, and looked again, but could see no
more of him. (Davidson, 1912, p. 34)


Although mystified by this strange encounter and the person's disappearance,
he never doubted the reality of the stranger. He spoke about
this stranger to his tennis partner, who told him that he (Davidson) had,
in fact, wandered about picking up tennis balls but had at no time met
any person in the field. His partner also said that she had heard him talking
to himself, a bad habit which he should overcome. Quite angrily,
Davidson completely rejected his partner's remarks, insisting on the truth

An allegedly autobiographical account, <i>Operators and Things</i>, written
under the pseudonym of Barbara O'Brien (1958) is in style and
content quite different from the usual description of hallucinatory experiences
that commonly involve ideas of persecution and religion,
accompanied by fearful astonishment. In contrast, Miss "O'Brien's"
description resembles modern science-fiction more than any other we have
encountered. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_72818');">[note]</a><div id="_note_72818" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ When this book was first published the editor attempted to verify its validity.
Mail to both publisher and author remained unanswered. More recently mail addressed
to Arlington Books (30 Arlington Street, Cambridge 40, Mass., the 1959
and last known address on file with the Copyright Office of The Library of Congress)
has been consistently returned marked "Moved, not forwardable" by the
postal service. In the editor's opinion <i>Operators and Things</i> should not be accepted
at face value until something more tangible can be learned about the circumstances
that gave rise to its writing and publication.</div> This unusual account begins with details of both visual
and auditory hallucinations, although the auditory experiences were at
all times better developed and more organized than were the visual ones.
The content of these hallucinations is very different from that of most
patients, but the effect of the voices was just as compelling for Miss
"O'Brien" as it was for any other deluded patient whose statements we
have reviewed. Miss "O'Brien," says she left a good position, her home,
and friends and started wandering across the country via Greyhound
buses, simply because the voices told her to do so.


The phenomena of hallucinations are so varied and so compelling in
the life of mental patients that I shall return to the topic of hallucinations
in greater detail in Chapter 6.


<b>UNREALITY</b>


Another frequent phenomenon that is most distressing and astonishing
to mental patients is one they refer to as a feeling of unreality. This
condition is usually reported as developing during the <i>course</i> of the
psychosis and is not prominent at the <i>beginning</i>. However, in Marguerite
Sechehaye's <i>Autobiography of a Schizophrenic Girl</i> the author cites the
patient's (Renee) vivid description of her earliest experience with feelings
of unreality, which occurred when she was five years old. Since her psychotic
difficulties did start at this early age and continued (so far as the

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember very well the day it happened. We were staying in the
country and I had gone for a walk alone as I did now and then. Suddenly, as
I was passing the school, I heard a German song; the children were having
a singing lesson. I stopped to listen, and at that instant a strange feeling came
over me, a feeling hard to analyze but akin to something I was to know too
well later--a disturbing sense of unreality. It seemed to me that I no longer
recognized the school, it had become as large as a barracks; the singing children
were prisoners, compelled to sing. It was as though the school and the children's
song were set apart from the rest of the world. At the same time my eye encountered
a field of wheat whose limits I could not see. The yellow vastness,
dazzling in the sun, bound up with the song of the children imprisoned in the
smooth stone school-barracks, filled me with such anxiety that I broke into sobs.
I ran home to our garden and began to play "to make things seem as they
usually were," that is, to return to reality. It was the first appearance of those
elements which were always present in later sensations of unreality: illimitable
vastness, brilliant light, and the gloss and smoothness of material things. I have
no explanation for what happened, or why. (Sechehaye, 1951, pp. 3--4)


Various patients use different words, phrases, and analogies to
describe the feeling of unreality they experience. It is, however, always
said to be unpleasant, distressing, and fearful, probably because the
individual feels an inner change that is somehow very undesirable. I will
return to these phenomena in Chapter 17.


<b><i>Denial of Insanity</i></b>


In my search for autobiographies of the insane I have found more
than a dozen books written by individuals who had been held, committed,
or certified as insane and institutionalized in some mental hospital, and
who, nevertheless protested that at no time had they actually been insane.
In general, these persons apparently undertook the writing of their autobiographies
in order to prove that their alleged insanity had been a
mistake and that they had been subjected to unjustified imprisonment.
Their accounts usually depict much the same circumstances and complaints
that actually led to the beginning of their derangement and are
quite similar to those of persons who did realize and admit their pathology.
Those who denied insanity may or may not have admitted that they
had at some time been confused and deluded, but, in general, insisted
that they had really been persecuted and that their complaints of ill-treatment
were fully justified.


An example of such a dubious mental state was given by Marcia
Hamilcar in her account, <i>Legally Dead</i>.

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had for some weeks previously to Christmas been very despondent, and
the future loomed blackly before me ... but I had no delusions ... I had, as it
were, lost the proportion of things; my mind was out of joint, and I was
physically too exhausted to right it myself, or to reason myself into a saner
condition ... I twisted the most innocent of actions into subjects for the deepest
remorse. (Hamilcar, 1910, pp. 88-90)


She continued by describing in some detail the physical and mental
abuse suffered at the hands of her sister, the matron of a nursing home,
and the attendants at an asylum. We cannot ascertain whether these
descriptions are completely factual, although she denied that she was, or
ever had been, insane. Miss Hamilcar's autobiography unfortunately
does not provide very much information concerning her inner mental
life. Essentially, she tells how she had had a period of melancholia,
marked by slight mental confusion and periods of self-accusation, whereupon
she had been sent by her sister to a nursing home and had there
been subjected to partial starvation and other forms of cruelty. She
firmly believed in her denial of insanity, that there had ever been any
true psychopathology, but gives no evidence of having known what the
criteria of insanity might be.


In his book My <i>Experiences in a Lunatic Asylum</i>, "A Sane Patient,"
the pseudonymous Merivale, described in detail his depression, hypochondria,
and mental confusion, which he said had been precipitated
by the death of a relative and was followed by several empty months
during which he had no regular work to occupy his time and interest.
Finally, he lapsed into a state of semiconsciousness and delirium, at
which time he was placed in a lunatic asylum where, during a period of
excitement, he attacked an attendant. Later his health steadily improved
and he was discharged from the asylum. He subsequently wrote his
book, in which he made the following statement.


I deny distinctly, deliberately, categorically, that I have ever been insane;
and I say that the fancies of delirium or hypochondria are as clearly to be
distinguished from those of madness as midday from midnight, on a very little
close observation, by every honest and unselfish mind. To send them to an
asylum for treatment is the best way to turn them to insanity. I have been
perfectly frank about my "delusions," for I remember them all, as had I been
mad I should not. A man may doubt if he is in his mind or no; he cannot
doubt whether or not he has been. (Merivale, 1879, p. 88)


This citation presents several interesting points. The writer admits
to having been mentally confused, depressed, and at times excited and
deluded, yet insists that he was never insane. His criterion for insanity
is a curious one--the ability to recall--for had he been insane, he said,
he would not have remembered his delusions. Since, as he says, he did
remember everything, he concludes that he could not possibly have been
insane. By the patient's own account, however, his behavior justifies the

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By no means have all the persons who denied their psychosis supplied
as much material, relevant to the fact, as did both Hamilcar and
Merivale. It is possible that some denials are bona fide and that some
individuals may have been unjustifiably accused of insanity, but the autobiographical
accounts indicate that such occurrences were not very
common.


<b>DISCUSSION</b>


We must depend on the subjective reports of experiences as they
have been related by those persons who have lived through them. It is
apparent that at the earliest stage of the abnormality, almost every
person regards his own psychotic experience as something that has never
happened to any human being before. Only after hospitalization do most
mental patients realize, by virtue of the environment, that there are other
individuals whose experiences seem to be quite as disturbing as their
own. Most psychotics are bewildered and confused when they first have
such unusual experiences, while the confusion, of itself, adds to the
subjectively perceived abnormality. All persons have difficulties in finding
the appropriate words and phrases to describe their experiences. At the
beginning, they do not know or have available many of the necessary
descriptive expressions that are commonly utilized by mental patients.
If one considers these difficulties, then the patients' problems become
more apparent as to the outstanding psychological changes that the
patient is trying to convey in narrating how the derangement began.


Essentially, each patient seems to be trying to say, "Something new,
different, terrifying and indescribable is happening or has happened to
my mind. Things seem unreal and indescribable; I can't control them;
they frighten me; something makes me do things that I don't want to do
but I can't help myself; new feelings, ideas and thoughts come to my
mind; I don't really know how to tell you what it's like."


After surveying many autobiographical descriptions, I conclude
from the reports of the subjective experience that two major considerations
occupy the patient's mind at the onset of the psychopathological
experience; first, the realization of the loss of adequate self-control, and
second, the attempt, usually not too successful, to explain these experiences
to himself.


The ordinary growth of the mind from birth through adolescence
is the period of organization of subjective feelings, sensations, and
memories, so that one becomes accustomed to the multiple interconnections
of events in the world as well as to the subjective feeling states
that usually go with the various circumstances. It is a process of mental

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If, after the age of sixteen or seventeen, an individual has experiences
that he has never had or heard about previously, he is surprised
and astonished. One has become "adjusted" to one's world, which seems
so familiar that one considers that all ordinary relationships are <i>real</i>
and lawful. Now an unusual experience occurs; something must be
changed in one's own private life. No one else shares these new experiences
or feelings. In fact, a person who attempts to communicate such
experiences to others is most apt to be told, "That's crazy. You'd better
forget such things and put them out of your mind." But one knows this
unusual experience cannot be forgotten or controlled. If it continues,
then one may, in time, come to agree with the idea of madness. This
realization is all the more convincing if one finds that ordinary explanations
or rationalizations are inadequate and only serve to alarm, rather
than to pacify, oneself and others.


In brief, the experiences at the beginning of a psychopathological
episode are usually recounted in terms of the realization of the inability
to exercise self-control and to find a basis for an adequate self-explanation.
These experiences, which are new ("this never happened to me
before") and practically unheard of, come to govern the individual's
mental life. The psychopathological experiences are neither simple nor
pleasant and are almost invariably difficult to describe.

<i>A lunatic appears insensible, but he is, perhaps the most
alive of any mind to ridicule, and to the contemptibleness
of his state. But he is, as I may say, unconsciously alive to
it. He does not acknowledge his own feelings, because his
mind is deeply engrossed in painful and excruciating conflicts;
he is already troubled by a thousand horrible and
fanciful ideas of danger; the victim of inward and preternatural
sarcasm, contumely, and derision. But he acts
strangely, from what he suffers unacknowledged and not
understood by himself</i>. (<i>Perceval</i>, 1838, pp. 205-206)
