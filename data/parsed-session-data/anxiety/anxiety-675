“I will a round unvarnished tale deliver.”


During the ever-memorable month of August, 1862, I had
acquired from debilitated health, in consequence of long
watching over my sick husband, and a great variety of other
duties pressing heavily upon me, a state of mind which he
thought was either insanity, or bordering upon it. In consequence
of nervous exhaustion, by this over-exertion, both
my physical and mental condition had acquired an unusual
degree of activity, such as often results by losing much
sleep, accompanied by excessive trouble or mental anxiety.
This was the only way in which my condition of mind at
the time of which I speak, varied from its ordinary channel;
and rest and recuperation of health were all that was needed
for my perfect restoration. My reasoning powers were not
in the least impaired; nor was I indisposed or incapacitated
as to the performance of a single domestic or other duty.


It was but a very few days after my husband had indicated
his fears of my sanity leaving me, that he proposed our removal
from Chicago to St. Paul, in Minnesota. In arranging
for this, he left me to perform all the duties of taking care
of our property and preparing to follow him. He thought
best to go a few weeks in advance, and previously gave me
many directions respecting the disposition of our domestic
affairs; to every one of which I diligently attended, scrupulously
consulting his interest and pleasure in the most minute
particulars.

When he returned from St. Paul, in just one week, he
found me confined in one of the city prisons in consequence
of unfounded rumors originated by himself, of my assumed
insanity! This most cruel and unnecessary action was performed
by one whose name, in mercy to himself and his family,
I will spare, and in the absence from the city of all my relations,
except one who had no power to protect me from this
most unexampled injustice. This nefarious business transpired,
not because I had either done or attempted the <i>least
posible harm</i>, but because it was feared that I <i>might!</i>


This shows the state of feeling existing in consequence of
a falsely educated public sentiment on this subject. A person
is reported insane; the first thing is to deprive him of all
proper sympathy and of all human rights, lest he should injure
some one! He is harmed, to keep others from being harmed;
and very often too, upon the strength of some ungrounded
suspicions promulgated by straggling reports. But it is
hoped the day is not far distant when people will learn that
it is better first to examine the facts of a case, instead of
hastily acting upon flying rumors, when the dearest rights of
human beings are at stake; when they will also learn that
prisons were made for criminals, and not for innocent and
feeble women !


Instead of weeping or complaining or raving in my prison,
as I think many less disciplined in the school of affliction
would have done, I remained perfectly quiet and self-possessed,
calmly awaiting the hour of deliverance which I instinctively
felt was near; and in this tranquil condition, my
husband found me the next day. The keys of the Armory
were instantly turned in another direction.


He had been cautioned to say but little to me, as I inferred
from the mysterious taciturnity of his manner. He evidently
thought my supposed malady would be increased by the “excitement”
of conversation; and under the influence of this
fear, forbore the proper means for investigation which would
have dissipated his delusion at once. An open review of the
facts would have elicited a correct understanding of affairs, and

There were some circumstances which made me willing to
go unresistingly to the “Asylum,” but I did not wish to go as
a patient; but there were reasons of entirely another character,
which will be developed in the course of my history,
which reconciled me temporarily to go there. It may well
be inferred that the circumstances from which could spring
so singular a resolultion, were of an exceedingly afflictive
character; indeed such as to try every tender chord of woman's
delicate nature. I watched myself with the severest
scrutiny, to keep calm in this severe ordeal of my affliction,
and strove” to evince by my deportment, more than usual
kindness and deference to those around me, and by attending

Our parting I shall not attempt to describe. We had
lived together more than five years, during which it had ever
been my study to promote his comfort, happiness, and interest
by every way in my power, according to my best intelligence.
He was dearer than my own ease or my own life;
for his sake I had resigned the former, and nearly sacrificed
the latter. And now for the first time, we were to be separated,
by his own wishes, on the basis of <i>suspicions</i> that I was,
or might become insane! A dark cloud was over my spirit
as I dimly foresaw the consequences to our future life of such
a separation. It seemed as if all the fountains of grief I had
ever experienced were now welling up anew to overwhelm
me. He exhorted me to be of good courage, assured me our
separation should be but transient, and promised to pray daily
for our happy reunion. I draw a veil over our final scene of
separation; it is too sadly sacred for the world to gaze upon.
We parted,--and forever.


He had employed my youngest brother to take me to the
“Asylum;” and when he left me in charge of the latter, and
stood in the street bowing and waving, with his hat, his final
adieus, it seemed that my very heart itself was left behind me.
I could not now restrain the blistering tears which rolled
in torrents down my face. My kind brother saw my emotion,
and Lad the good sense not to speak to me, aware that words
could prove but the veriest mockery of consolation.


August 6th was the fatal day in which the formidable, doors
of that institution, the world calls an “Asylum,” were locked
upon me, and I found myself indeed a prisoner. Finding
it inevitable, I submitted with cheerfulness. This submission
however was given under a very mistaken idea of the
doom impending over me.


It was understood by a special arrangement between myself
and the Superintendent, that I was to have a comfortable
room all the time; free from the noise of turbulent patients,

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was of course admitted to the Seventh, the most pleasant
and highly privileged of all the wards. There my brother
left me with my own consent, being assured in my presence,
by the officers, that everything should be done for my comfort
and for the resuscitation of my exhausted health.


I was now pleasantly initiated in what I supposed would
be an “Asylum” to me in my weak and exhausted condition
of body, and very cheerfully surrendered myself to the two
attendants of that hall, both of whom appeared to be pleasant
and amiable ladies. Firmly resolving to obey every rule of
the institution, I candidly and kindly told Dr. McFarland
this my determination.


I particularly desired to make myself agreeable to my attendants,
not only by sparing them all unnecessary trouble
in attending to my wants, but by anticipating their own
wishes, and rendering them unhesitating obedience in all
their requirements of me. That I faithfully adhered to this
resolution all the time I was in their hall, and that I ever
treated them respectfully and kindly, they did me the justice
to bear me ample witness, a short time previous to my leaving
the institution. It was my wish to convince my friends,
especially my husband, that my industrious habits were not
in the least impaired by my supposed “insanity.” Therefore,
my next object was to obtain some yarn, which I wished
to knit for myself, that being necessary; next, for my husband,
and after that, I wished to knit a quantity of hosiery
for the soldiers.


I supposed the matron, Mrs. McFarland, would be willing
to sell yarn to me for these useful purposes; but in this I had
made a mistake. Had I done this proposed knitting, and
some other work I sought, it would have come into collision
with some of their plans, one of which was to have me, as
do most of their victims, work unpaid for the “Asylum;” or in

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I assiduously cultivated the acquaintance of all the patients;
many of them were very amiable in manners, and of
a high grade of intelligence; and all, or nearly all, facile and
ladylike in deportment, and easily won to conversation.
They at once recognized a friend in me, and confided to me
their tales of suffering, and much of their previous history.
From my acquaintance with these most interesting people, I
acquired a deeper knowledge of the human heart, and of human
experience than I had ever learned before. It is not
superfluous to say that I found them all unhappy, except
those who were expecting soon to leave the place. The
rest were all extremely unreconciled to the fact of their being
forcibly detained in that place, when it was their choice
to return to their homes.


But <i>my</i> greatest unhappiness arose from my anxiety respecting
my husband. I knew, better than any one else,
the peculiar bent of his mind, and how much he needed some
one to soothe those agitations which I knew would occasionally
sweep over his spirit. Who, like myself, could or would
attempt to “hush the storm and soothe to peace?” Who
should be the companion of his lonely hours? Who nurse
and solace him in the trials of despondency and sickness, as
I had ever delighted to do? Who would stand between him
and the shafts of malice and evil tongues, and who, with
tireless care, guard his happiness and life from all that could
imperil the existence of either, as I had never ceased to do?
Ah! these were queries which I could not solve. I could
solace the disquietude of my mind only by daily committing
him to the care of a merciful God, whose unslumbering eye
is over all his children. This I never ceased to do, and thus
found a balm for my deeply wounded spirit.

I kept constantly employed in reading, writing, and work
ing, and in cultivating the acquaintance of my companions in
bonds. An intense desire, and one which I never lost sight
of, was to try to alleviate the sufferings of those around me.
This field of labor had <i>no</i> limits.
