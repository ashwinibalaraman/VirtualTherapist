<font size="4"><b>16: Urinary Incontinence</b></font>

Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine. It is a common condition
affecting approximately 30% of older adults living in the community (Diokno,
Brock, Brown, &amp; Herzog, 1986) and over half of those who reside in nursing
homes (Ouslander, Kane, &amp; Abrass, 1982). Mild incontinence may be managed
with only minor accommodations of lifestyle, but moderate or severe
incontinence has more serious implications. It predisposes patients to other
health problems (e.g., skin breakdown, urinary tract infections) and has
negative consequences on the emotional and social well-being of its sufferers
(Wyman, Harkins, &amp; Fantl, 1990). It can adversely affect daily activities and
interpersonal relationships, limit social activities, and contribute to both
depression and anxiety in some individuals. Still, there is considerable variability
in how individuals respond to incontinence, with some studies reporting
little effect on measures of self-esteem and psychological well-being
(Breakwell &amp; Walker, 1988; Simons, 1985). Incontinence is a significant
source of dependence among the elderly and a widely cited factor in nursing
home admissions (Johnson &amp; Werner, 1982). The costs of incontinence are

Urinary incontinence is a multifaceted condition for which a variety of
treatments have been developed, ranging from surgical to medical and behavioral.
Although most cases of incontinence can be significantly improved or
cured with the treatments available today, fewer than half of individuals with
this problem are evaluated or treated (Burgio, Ives, Locher, Arena, &amp; Kuller,
1994; Consensus Conference, 1989).


Even as treatments for incontinence are improved and made more available,
barriers to treatment exist in the attitudes held by patients and health care
providers. Because incontinence is socially unacceptable and can be embarrassing,
many incontinent persons ignore or conceal the problem and avoid seeking
help. Many of those who do seek help are encouraged to accept incontinence as
a natural and inevitable consequence of advancing age or of childbearing. As a
result, incontinence is often regarded as untreatable and patients are managed less
than optimally. One study of U.S. nursing homes found that incontinence was
mentioned infrequently in physicians' notes and that less than 5% of patients
received a diagnostic evaluation (Ouslander et al., 1982). In another study of three
nursing homes, incontinence was included in the medical problem list of less than
5% of the incontinent residents (Ribeiro &amp; Smith, 1985).


Urinary incontinence affects individuals of every age, but it is most prevalent
among the elderly. As a result, incontinence is commonly and mistakenly
attributed to age. In fact, older adults are more likely to have conditions that
predispose them to incontinence or contribute to the causes of incontinence.
Many of these conditions may be controlled or avoided if properly identified.
Urinary incontinence is not a normal aspect of aging nor is it irreversible.
Elderly patients should be managed with the same effort afforded to younger
patients with incontinence and with special attention to age-related deficits,
such as impaired mobility, diminished vision, or deficits in mental status.
Incontinence is a problem with many possible causes, each of which needs to
be explored. Only through careful assessment can specific deficits be identified
and rational treatment implemented.


This chapter describes behavioral approaches to the assessment and treatment
of urinary incontinence with special attention to common causes of
incontinence in the elderly. Behavioral interventions are especially relevant
for the elderly for several reasons. Among the most compelling reasons for
using behavioral treatment procedures is their effectiveness. Given proper
training and adequate time, the great majority of appropriately selected
patients experience significant improvement or cure. A second reason for
using behavioral treatment with the elderly is the increased risk of surgery in
these patients and the number of those with medical conditions that preclude
surgery. Third is the fact that behavioral treatments avoid the side effects of

[p. <i>351</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00357&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Last, the 1988 National Institute of Health Consensus Conference on
Urinary Incontinence in Adults concluded that "in general, the least invasive
procedure should be tried first" and that "for many types of incontinence,
behavioral treatments meet this criterion" (Concensus Conference, 1989,
p. 2689). Behavioral procedures are efficient, low risk, and without documented
side effects, making them an attractive treatment option for many older adults.


It should not be inferred from this that behavioral treatment will be the best
solution for everyone. Sometimes, surgery or medication will be the best
option. Management of incontinence should be based on the same principles
as management of any medical disorder: All incontinent patients should first
be evaluated, and the decision to intervene behaviorally should be reached
concurrently by the physician and behavioral therapist.


<b>Physiology of Urinary Incontinence</b>


Normal micturition and urinary continence involve a complex set of physiological
responses, described in depth by Bradley, Timm, and Scott (1974).
As the bladder fills, stretch receptors in the bladder wall signal the sacral
spinal cord. At a critical threshold volume, a spinal cord reflex (the micturition
reflex) stimulates the bladder to empty. This is accomplished by rhythmic
contractions of the detrusor muscle, a smooth muscle that surrounds the
bladder, and relaxation of the external urinary sphincter, a striated muscle that
surrounds the urethra. The micturition reflex stimulates bladder emptying in
infants and spinal cord-transected patients. Voluntary control over urination
is accomplished through inhibition of the micturition reflex via neural circuits
from the cerebral cortex. Continence requires that the individual anticipate
the threshold for bladder emptying and avoid incontinence by voiding before
the threshold is reached or more commonly, by perceiving bladder distention
and inhibiting reflex contractions until an appropriate setting for urination is
reached. One must also be able to occlude the urethra to prevent incontinence
during uninhibited bladder contraction or sudden pressure rises associated
with physical activities such as coughing or sneezing. Also important to the
maintenance of continence is the ability to voluntarily empty the bladder.
Failure to emit these physiological responses at the appropriate times results
in one of the following common types of incontinence: (a) <i>stress incontinence</i>,
in which the outlet does not stay closed tightly during transient pressure rises;

[p. <i>352</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00358&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Types and Causes of Incontinence</b>


In up to one third of cases, urinary incontinence is a transient difficulty related
to urinary tract infection or an acute illness that produces confusion or immobilizes
the patient (Isaacs &amp; Walkey, 1964; Yarnell &amp; St. Legar, 1979). Transient
incontinence is resolved with appropriate treatment of the precipitating condition.
Persistent incontinence, or established incontinence, can be classified as stress
incontinence, urge incontinence, overflow incontinence, or functional incontinence
according to the primary mechanism of urine loss.


STRESS INCONTlNENCE


Stress urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine that occurs
following a sudden rise in intra-abdominal pressure produced by physical
activities such as coughing, sneezing, jogging, or lifting. Incontinence results
when a corresponding rise in bladder pressure exceeds urethral resistance in
the absence of detrusor contraction. The cause for the leakage is inadequacy
of the bladder outlet, in which the urethra is unable to stay closed tightly
during the transient pressure increases. Stress incontinence occurs so commonly
in women that mild incontinence is accepted as normal by many
women, and a surprising number are not inconvenienced enough to seek
treatment. One study of the prevalence of stress incontinence in young,
nulliparous women reported that 51% experienced stress incontinence, although
only 16% had daily leakage (Wolin, 1969). In men, stress incontinence
is uncommon and is usually a result of urologie surgery, such as prostatectomy.
One commonly accepted etiologic factor of female stress incontinence
is perinatal damage to the supporting tissues of the pelvic floor. The precise
mechanism of urine loss is a topic of debate. Anatomical explanations emphasize
the loss of the vesicourethral angle due to overstretched or damaged
pelvic floor tissues. A normal angle between the bladder floor and urethra
provides transmission of pressure to the urethra and bladder simultaneously
during physical activities. Thus, urethral pressure is increased at the same time
as the transient rise in bladder pressure and prevents leakage. When the

[p. <i>353</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00359&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Functional explanations of stress incontinence attribute urinary leakage to a
lack of awareness or voluntary control of pelvic muscles (Kegel 1948, 1956) or
a failure of the striated muscle of the distal urethral sphincter to contract during
transient rises in intra-abdominal pressure. The usual method for improving weak
muscles is physiotherapy. Behavioral methods for training patients to exercise
and use pelvic muscles are described in detail later in this chapter.


Stress incontinence is commonly associated with atrophic vaginitis in
postmenopausal women and may be treated with topical or oral estrogen.
Studies of estrogen therapy have reported beneficial effects on urinary control
(Faber &amp; Heidenreich, 1977; Judge, 1969; Walter, Wolf, Barlebo, &amp; Jensen,
1978). Long-term estrogen therapy carries a risk of endometrial cancer, which
can be reduced or eliminated by administering the estrogen in low, cyclic
doses with progestin (Harman &amp; Robinson, 1982).


URGE INCONTHNENCE


Urge incontinence is the accidental loss of urine associated with a sudden desire
to void. Urine is lost when the detrusor muscle surrounding the bladder spasms,
forcing urine through the urethra. Normally, detrusor contraction is inhibited until
a toilet can be reached. The category of urge incontinence encompasses a group
of disorders including bladder instability, detrusor hyperreflexia, spastic bladder,
neurogenic bladder, or uninhibited bladder. This inability to inhibit detrusor
contraction can be caused by neurological disorders or injuries that impair central
nervous system control, such as cerebrovascular accident, brain tumor, dementia,
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury. Bladder dysfunction
can also be produced by local inflammation or irritation of the bladder or urethra
resulting from conditions such as urinary tract infection, fecal impaction, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, uterine prolapse, or bladder carcinoma. It has also been
asserted that bladder instability can result from poor bladder habits, such as
frequent voiding. Repeated low-volume voiding prevents the bladder from accommodating
normal urine volumes and is purported to decrease bladder capacity,
resulting in increased urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence

[p. <i>354</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00360&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several pharmacologic agents have proven effective in reducing urge incontinence.
Two drugs--oxybutynin chloride and imipramine--have been tested in a
small number of elderly patients, with 60% to 70% showing improvement
(Castleden, George, Renwick, &amp; Asher, 1981; Moisey, Stephenson, &amp; Brendler,
1980). The major disadvantage of this class of drugs is their side effects. In
the study of oxybutynin chloride, 55% of the patients reported side effects,
primarily dry mouth, and 20% discontinued the drug as a result. Imipramine
is well known to behavioral therapists because it is frequently used as an
antidepressant. Its major side effects in the elderly are mucous membrane
dryness, confusion, drowsiness, or urinary retention. The behavioral procedures,
which are described later in the chapter, have the advantage that they
avoid these side effects.


OVERFLOW INCONTINENCE


Overflow incontinence is the leakage of urine when pressure in a chronically
full bladder exceeds urethral resistance. This may be due to an atonic
(acontractile) bladder or to a functional or mechanical obstruction of the
bladder outlet. Atonic bladder commonly results from spinal cord trauma or
diabetes mellitus. In the elderly, outlet obstruction can be due to fecal
impaction (Willington, 1980). An estimated 55.6% of constipated nursing
home residents are incontinent, compared to approximately 42% of those who
are not constipated (Van Nostrand, Zappolo, Hing et al., 1979). Other sources
of obstruction are benign prostatic hypertrophy, carcinoma of the prostate,
and bladder-sphincter dyssynergia, in which the sphincter contracts simultaneously
with bladder contractions. Treatment of overflow incontinence almost
always requires surgery to remove the obstruction or catheters to keep
the bladder empty. Medications to reduce urethral pressure have been shown
to be effective for some patients. Behavioral treatment is rarely appropriate
for treatment of overflow incontinence.


FUNCTIONAL INCONTINENCE


Functional incontinence is the loss of urine resulting from an inability or
unwillingness to use the toilet appropriately. Whether or not an individual has
bladder or sphincter deficits, functional incontinence can be precipitated by

[p. <i>355</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00361&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In patients with significant cognitive impairment, incontinence may be related to
memory deficits, confusion, depression, or fears that interfere with appropriate
voiding. Ouslander et al. (1982), using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(Pfeiffer, 1976), showed that most elderly, incontinent nursing home patients
have some degree of cognitive impairment and that the severity of this impairment
was related to the degree of incontinence. Similarly, incontinence is occasionally a
manipulative behavior for the purpose of eliciting attention or the result of indifference
to the social consequences of wetting. It is not unusual in institutional or home
settings for incontinence to elicit more attention than dryness. Under these circumstances,
treatment may involve the rearrangement of environmental contingencies
so that positive behavior (e.g., toileting and dryness) elicits attention and incontinence
elicits negative or neutral consequences (e.g., disapproval).


Environmental factors, such as lack of privacy, uncomfortable toilet facilities,
poor lighting, and physical barriers, can also contribute to functional incontinence.
Factors involved in functional incontinence are crucial variables in nursing home
patients whose lack of bladder control is often secondary to the disabilities that
necessitated institutional care. Intervention for functional incontinence aims to

[p. <i>356</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00362&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Assessment</b>


The purpose of behavioral assessment is to characterize incontinence and to
identify the mechanism of urine loss. Knowledge of an underlying disease is often
useful but not always sufficient to identify the mechanism or to treat incontinence.
Urine loss will occur when intravesical (bladder) pressure exceeds urethral
resistance, regardless of the presence or the nature of an underlying disease.
Furthermore, the cause of urinary incontinence in the older adult is often multifactored
and may be amenable to change by more than one means. Behavioral
assessment should be accompanied by medical screening, including history
taking and physical examination, to detect conditions that may not be apparent
otherwise and to exclude conditions that are inappropriate for behavioral intervention.
Examination of urine to detect urinary tract infection is an indispensable
component of the routine medical evaluation. Postvoid catheterization for residual
urine will detect overflow incontinence, which usually requires medical or
surgical intervention. Physical examination will reveal the presence of fecal
impaction, benign prostatic hypertrophy, atrophic vaginitis, and other conditions
that are reversible causes of incontinence.


THE HISTORY


Behavioral evaluation of incontinence begins with an interview of the
patient or a caregiver, if the patient is unable to participate. Using carefully
selected questions, the interviewer can elicit information that in many cases
will provide a clear picture of the behavioral mechanisms (or correlates) of
the incontinence and help formulate a preliminary diagnosis. Care should be
taken to identify the circumstances (or antecedents) of incontinence, to obtain
a description of typical incontinent episodes, and to ascertain the effects of
wetting. Patients with urge incontinence usually give a clear description of
accidents that occur in the presence of a strong urge to void and an inability
to reach the toilet in time. Typical antecedents of urge incontinence are the
sounds of running water, thoughts about going to the bathroom, the sight of
a toilet, or cold weather. A common report is the occurrence of accidents as
one returns home and unlocks the door of the house. This difficulty, termed
<i>key in the door syndrome</i>, is partially the result of classical conditioning in
which arriving home has been repeatedly paired with bladder emptying.

[p. <i>357</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00363&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Patients with stress incontinence are usually able to identify specific physical
activities that precipitate incontinence. Common among these are coughing,
sneezing, lifting, bending, or stooping. One must be alert to identify cases
in which the physical activity is subtle. Patients occasionally report the
absence of physical activity when in fact they are walking, turning, or standing
up from a sitting position. Incontinence can occur with slight jarring movements
(as when climbing stairs) or with changes in position of which the
patient may be unaware.


BLADDER DIARY


Bladder diaries are used to document voiding habits and patterns of incontinence
on a daily basis. Diaries serve two purposes. First, they provide a picture
of the patient's behavior that, together with the interview, can be used to identify
preventable causes of incontinence and formulate an accurate diagnosis and
treatment plan. Second, they function as a vehicle for evaluating progress and
testing the effectiveness of treatment. Self-recording eliminates an important
source of error by circumventing the patient's verbal report. It is difficult for
patients to judge the frequency or patterns of incontinence retrospectively,
especially if the patterns are irregular. Keeping a diary for a period of 2 weeks
will often reveal patterns of variability that the patient finds difficult to communicate.
Patients are sometimes surprised at the actual number of accidents, once
they are required to record them. We have seen patients who profess improvement,
whereas their diaries showed no change in the volume or frequency of
accidents. Thus, we emphasize the importance of bladder diaries for preventing
any tendencies patients may have to report positively on their progress for the
purpose of pleasing the doctor. A variety of diary forms have been developed for
documentation of bladder habits, some of which are complex. If patients or
caregivers are expected to keep meaningful records, a simple bladder form is
crucial. A form that we have used to document the most necessary information
is presented in Table 16.1 (Whitehead, Burgio, &amp; Engel, 1984). Space is provided
to record the time of voiding, the time of incontinent episodes, whether the
accident was large or small based on whether the outer clothing was wet, and last,
the reason for or circumstances of incontinence, which is helpful in identifying
the antecedents of incontinence.


OBSERVATION OF MOBILITY AND TOILETING SKILLS


The ability to reach and use the toilet appropriately is a basic skill for the
maintenance of continence. Direct observation of one or more toileting

[p. <i>358</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00364&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION


Appropriate voiding habits and continence can be seriously disrupted by
depression or cognitive deficits, such as confusion, disorientation, and memory
impairment. Although these deficits may surface in other areas of assessment,
it is often useful to evaluate them using standardized tests. The Mini-Mental
State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975) is a brief test
of mental status that includes assessment of orientation, alertness, memory,
attention, and judgment. However, because it was designed for rapid and easy
assessment of acutely ill patients, it does not fully evaluate the range of
cognition, and when indicated, it should be supplemented by more elaborate
neuropsychological instruments. Depression may be evaluated using a structured
device, such as the Center for Epidemiological Study's CES-D Scale
(Radloff, 1977) or the Geriatric Depression Scale (Yesavage et al., 1983a).


URODYNAMIC TESTING


Physiological measurements of bladder pressure and sphincter activity are
routine methods for assessing bladder or sphincter dysfunction. The <i>cystometrogram</i>
is a test that measures bladder pressure during rapid bladder filling
and is a standard procedure in urology clinics. It is often complemented by
measurement of intraurethral pressures (urethral pressure profile) or measurement
of pelvic floor activity (sphincter electromyography [EMG] or manometry).
The cystometrogram is very useful in evaluating bladder physiology and, with

[p. <i>360</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00366&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Voluntary contractions of the periurethral muscles can be measured in a
variety of ways, one of which is the use of an air-filled balloon at the external
anal sphincter. Because the innervation of the external urethral sphincter is
similar to that of the external anal sphincter, this balloon provides an index
of urethral sphincter activity. To minimize the effects of motivational state,
the patient is specifically instructed to contract the sphincter muscles and to
hold the contractions for a specified period of time. The test should also
include a measure of intra-abdominal pressure, such as rectal pressure. The
purpose of this measure is to distinguish increases in bladder pressure that are
attributable to increases in intra-abdominal pressure as well as to detect
inappropriate responses to the desire to void. Many incontinent patients

[p. <i>361</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00367&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some investigators report that careful history and physical examination
provide an accurate diagnosis of urinary tract dysfunction (Hinman, 1979).
Hilton and Stanton (1981) developed a clinical algorithm for categorizing
incontinent women and compared its outcome to the results of urodynamic
assessment. They concluded that the algorithm provided 83% accuracy in
diagnosis. Other investigators have noted significant disparities between
clinical and urodynamic investigations (Katz &amp; Blaivas, 1983). Certainly,
urcdynamic procedures occasionally detect urinary tract abnormalities that go
unnoticed during clinical examination, and the discrepancy warrants alteration
of the treatment plan. However, other discrepancies (e.g., normal urodynamic
findings in patients with urge incontinence) may not necessitate changing
the intervention indicated by the clinical interview (Hilton &amp; Stanton,
1981). In addition, the validity of urodynamic testing needs to be evaluated.
Because the procedure of bladder filling is accelerated, it may produce instability
in patients who otherwise have stable patterns. Abnormal patterns have been
documented in patients who do not experience incontinence (Brocklehurst &amp;
Dillane, 1966), and we have seen stable patterns in patients who clearly describe
urge incontinence outside the clinic setting. Clinicians are becoming increasingly
aware that the test situation lacks certain components that stimulate
bladder instability. It is for this reason that supine cystometry is usually
complemented by provocative maneuvers, such as standing or coughing,
which in many cases will reveal instability otherwise masked by the quiet,
supine position. But there remain many antecedents of incontinence aside
from bladder filling (e.g., running water, cold weather, laughing) that are
usually absent from the test situation.


Urodynamic testing in patients with cognitive impairment poses a significant
problem because it relies on the active cooperation and understanding of
the patient. First, it is necessary that patients understand that they should make
every effort to inhibit urine loss and second, they must be motivated to do so.
If either criterion is not met, the mechanism of an uninhibited detrusor
contraction may be uninterpretable.


The contribution of a dysfunctional urinary tract in determining incontinence
in the nursing home population is controversial. Researchers have
reported the percentage of nursing home residents with normal bladder
function to be as low as 1% (Resnick et al., 1988) and as high as 41% (Resnick,
Yalla, &amp; Laurino, 1989). Moreover, it is questionable whether a finding of
bladder instability is predictive of incontinence. Resnick et al. (1988) have
suggested that abnormal bladder function may be incidental to normal aging
and not strongly predictive of incontinence in these patients. One setting in

[p. <i>362</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00368&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Intervention</b>


The choice of behavioral intervention depends on the results of the behavioral
evaluation of the patient's deficits. Generally, elderly patients will fall
into one of two categories: those who are capable of learning self-management
procedures and those who require ongoing intervention from a caregiver.
Usually but not necessarily, the former will be community dwelling and the latter
will be institutionalized. Community-dwelling patients usually have demonstrable
bladder or sphincter dysfunction but are otherwise functional in terms of
self-care, often have little or no cognitive impairment, and usually are capable of
independent living. They can be managed in an outpatient setting where the
patient receives training in self-management skills in the clinic, and prescribed
practice is implemented at home. In contrast, institutionalized patients are often
characterized by functional dependence and significant cognitive or mobility
impairment and will require assistance in the management of incontinence. Many
of these will be unaware of or indifferent to their incontinence. Management
requires family or institutional staff to implement treatment procedures that
involve the control of environmental factors.


STRESS INCONTINENCE


Stress incontinence occurs because the urethra does not stay closed tightly
during transient rises in abdominal pressure caused by physical exertion.
Behavior therapy for stress incontinence consists of teaching skills to prevent
urine loss through voluntary contraction of periurethral muscles. The goal is
to increase intraurethral pressure for a short period of time during the activity
that causes leakage (coughing, sneezing, lifting, or other physical exertion).
The training improves not only the strength of pelvic muscles but voluntary
control over the muscles as well.


Pelvic muscle training had been done in several ways. Originally, gynecologist
Arnold Kegel used a biofeedback device, the perineometer, for this
purpose (Kegel, 1948, 1956). The pneumatic chamber was placed in the
vagina and when pelvic muscles contracted, the increased pressure exerted on
the perineometer chamber was registered on a handheld pressure gauge. This
method provided immediate visual feedback of muscle contraction and was
used to identify the proper muscles and to guide and coordinate pelvic muscle
exercise.

[p. <i>363</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00369&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Historically, it has been more common to teach pelvic muscle contraction
through brief instructions to lift the pelvic floor or interrupt the urinary stream.
Verbal or written instructions are not widely effective, however, probably
because patients do not correctly identify the pelvic muscles. More useful is
the technique in which the examiner provides immediate verbal feedback of
several attempted muscle contractions based on vaginal or anal palpation.
Perhaps the best technique is to actually measure pelvic muscle activity and
provide immediate feedback of muscle activity using biofeedback training.
<i>Biofeedback</i> is a form of behavioral training that attempts to reverse incontinence
by altering physiological responses of the bladder and the pelvic floor
muscles that mediate incontinence. The targets of the intervention are the
striated muscles of the pelvic floor or abdominal wall and the smooth detrusor
muscle that mediates bladder emptying. Physiological change is possible
through the use of operant conditioning in which suitably motivated patients
can learn by observing the results of their attempts to voluntarily control
bladder and sphincter responses. Intraurethral resistance can be increased by
training patients to contract periurethral muscles. There is evidence in the
literature that biofeedback increases the efficacy of training and improves
treatment outcome (Burgio, Robinson, &amp; Engel, 1986; Shepherd, Montgomery,
&amp; Anderson, 1983). Measurement of external anal sphincter activity or
vaginal muscle activity using manometry or electromyography can be used to
teach pelvic muscle contraction and relaxation.


The most common error in pelvic muscle training involves the voluntary
contraction of other muscles, most typically abdominal or gluteal muscles.
Abdominal contraction that presents itself as a bearing down response is
particularly problematic because it increases intravesical rather than intraurethral
pressure. During training, abdominal muscle activity should be measured
using a rectal balloon (intra-abdominal pressure) or surface electrodes (abdominal
electromyogram). The patient can then be given simultaneous bio-feedback
of abdominal and pelvic muscles, allowing him or her to learn
through operant conditioning (trial and error learning) how to contract the
pelvic muscles selectively while keeping abdominal muscles relaxed. Without
this selective control, pelvic muscle contraction can be uncoordinated, counter-productive,
and clinically ineffective.


Once the pelvic muscles are located and brought under selective control, it
is crucial to begin an individualized program of home practice in which the
patient increases strength and control through daily exercises. A sample of
patient instructions is presented in Table 16.2.


Although the optimal number of exercises has not been agreed on, 45 to 50
exercises per day has yielded good results in several studies. The exercises
should be divided among two or more sessions per day. Such distribution

In addition to building strength, it is important to instruct patients to
contract their muscles voluntarily to prevent urine loss during coughing,
lifting, or whatever activities are known to produce incontinence. Exercise
alone can increase resting tone, but active, maximal contraction is usually
needed to prevent incontinence through a transient rise in intraurethral pressure.
Improvement in continence is gradual, usually evident by the 4th week
of training and may continue up to 6 months.


A typical account of pelvic muscle exercise failure is the woman who tries
the exercises for a few days, then finding them ineffective, she gives up. The
challenge of behavioral treatment is to establish and sustain patient compliance
for an adequate period of time until results are achieved. Once the patient
can prevent accidents by using these skills and can experience a sense of
renewed control over bodily function, the positive effects of treatment reinforce
the patient's efforts, and the behavior is more likely to be sustained.


Research on pelvic muscle training and exercise indicate that 27% to 73%
of patients are cured and 38% to 100% improved. Two studies are worthy of
particular note because they are randomized clinical trials. The first, conducted
by Wells and colleagues, compared pelvic muscle exercise to phenyl-propanolamine
in older women (Wells, Brink, Diokno, Wolfe, &amp; Gillis,
1991). Phenyl-propanolamine is a medication that tightens the sphincter and
increases pressure in the urethra. Although the site of action of the two
treatments is different (one affects striated muscle, the other smooth muscle),
they produced similar results as measured by patients' subjective reports of
improvement (77% vs. 84%) as well as by diary.

[p. <i>365</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00371&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second study was a randomized trial comparing groups treated with
pelvic muscle exercise to an untreated control group (Burns, Pranikoff,
Nochajski, Desotelle, &amp; Harwood, 1990). Pelvic muscle training without
biofeedback produced an average 54% reduction of incontinence compared
to an average 6% reduction in the control group. Teaching pelvic muscle
exercise using vaginal EMG biofeedback resulted in a mean 61% improvement,
which was not significantly better than treating without biofeedback.


As noted, however, this finding is inconsistent with two smaller yet controlled
studies that have demonstrated an advantage for patients treated with
biofeedback (Burgio et al., 1986; Shepherd et al., 1983). Although the best
methods for teaching the exercises and the optimal exercise regimen have not
been established, many studies demonstrate convergently that pelvic muscle
training and exercise is a highly effective conservative intervention for stress
incontinence.


URGE INCONTINENCE


The underlying problem in urge incontinence is that the muscle of the
bladder wall spasms involuntarily and forces urine out through the urethra.
Behavioral approaches to urge incontinence focus on reducing incontinence
through temporal voiding schedules or by teaching patients how to inhibit
detrusor spasm voluntarily.


<i>Bladder Training and Voiding Schedules</i>


Voiding schedules are the primary components of procedures such as habit
training and bladder retraining. In habit training, a fixed or flexible voiding
schedule is adopted that avoids incontinence by having the patient empty the
bladder regularly and before it reaches a volume that triggers urgency and
incontinence (Clay, 1980; Sogbein &amp; Awad 1982). The voiding schedule can
be adjusted to the needs and habits of the patient (Clay, 1978). The goal is to
avoid incontinence by emptying the bladder regularly, but the intention is not
to change bladder function or capacity.


Bladder retraining is different in that the aim is to restore a normal pattern
of voiding and normal bladder function. Bladder training encourages the
patient to adopt an expanded voiding interval. By gradually increasing the
intervals between voidings, it attempts to correct the bad habit of frequent
voiding, improve the ability to suppress bladder instability, and eventually
diminish urgency. Frewen (1978, 1980) provided the rationale for this approach.
He suggested that urinary frequency is a precursor and a precipitant
of bladder instability and that urgency is not only a symptom of detrusor

<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I031&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Bladder Biofeedback</i>


In the interventions described earlier, toileting habits are the primary targets
of behavioral change. Learning to suppress detrusor contraction can also be
accomplished through bladder pressure biofeedback. The earliest reported use
of a biofeedback procedure for urge incontinence was by Wilson (1948). He
reported that 10 of 23 elderly patients with precipitancy or incontinence were
improved or made completely continent and 5 others were somewhat improved

[p. <i>367</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00373&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Pelvic Muscle Training</i>


Pelvic muscles also play a critical role in the control of detrusor function.
Using the same training techniques described for stress incontinence, patients
can learn to contract their pelvic muscles strongly and repeatedly in response
to urgency. Pelvic muscle training can be performed simultaneously with
bladder pressure biofeedback (bladder-sphincter biofeedback). In 1979, investigators
at the National Institute on Aging developed a procedure that
provides simultaneous feedback of bladder pressure, sphincter activity, and
intra-abdominal pressure using the instrumentation shown in Figure 16.1
(Burgio, Whitehead, &amp; Engel, 1985). The third component, intra-abdominal
pressure, was added because many patients exhibit a tendency to tense
abdominal muscles while trying to prevent incontinence. This behavior is
counterproductive because it increases bladder pressure and consequently
increases the probability of urine loss. Simultaneous feedback of the three
pressures provides a mechanism for operant conditioning of bladder, sphincter,
and abdominal muscle responses. Specifically, patients acquire selective
responses: bladder inhibition (relaxation) or active contraction of pelvic floor
muscles coupled with abdominal relaxation. This allows patients to observe
bladder pressure and coordinate pelvic muscle contractions with any rise in

and Sphincter Biofeedback</div>


<i>Urge Strategies</i>


Patients with urge incontinence typically display a maladaptive response
to the sensation of urgency. When they sense the urge to void, they rush to
the toilet, often leaking along the way. This behavior is counterproductive
because it produces increased intra-abdominal pressure on the bladder, often
increasing the sensation of fullness; it can stimulate detrusor contraction; and
it may interfere with the ability to concentrate on detrusor inhibition. Furthermore,
the closer one comes to the toilet, the greater are the cues that trigger
urination.


Through a lifelong process of classical conditioning in which voiding is
repeatedly paired with the visual cues of the bathroom, the cues eventually
become cues for voiding and the thought or sight of the bathroom can elicit
detrusor contraction. For people with urge incontinence, it can be the bathroom
itself that enhances urgency and elicits detrusor instability. For a person
with urge incontinence, the worst time to head for the bathroom is when they
already have a strong desire to void. The best time is before they have an urge
or after they have successfully reduced or eliminated an urge to void (see

Instructions to this effect often seem counterintuitive, but most patients can be
successfully convinced to try a new strategy based on the failure of their current
habits. It is important for patient and therapist to recognize that the urge strategy
involves practice and skill and to accept that initial attempts may fail. However,
the first successful attempt often brings with it a rush of insight that confirms the
direction of the therapy and reinforces compliance with the new strategy. To avoid
early failure, the therapist should be certain that the patient has properly identified
pelvic muscles and has completed a week or more of daily exercise. Familiarity
with pelvic muscle contraction will increase the patient's ability to use the
muscles under the stressful circumstances of the new urge strategy.


The behavioral training program consisting of the biofeedback procedure
combined with urge strategies was tested in an outpatient clinic. After a 2-hour
voiding schedule failed to resolve incontinence in 18 elderly patients with
urge incontinence, the biofeedback procedure was implemented. Patients
achieved 39% to 100% reductions of incontinence following an average of
four training sessions (Burgio et al., 1985). Included in the sample were four
men with bladder instability secondary to cerebrovascular accident who
achieved total continence by the 6-month follow-up. Other studies have
produced similar results with mean improvements ranging from 75% to 85%
(Baigis-Smith, Smith, Rose, &amp; Newman, 1989; Burgio, Stutzman, &amp; Engel,

[p. <i>371</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00377&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I036&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Clearly, the behavioral approaches to urge incontinence can and should be
combined. For example, patients who have learned to contract pelvic muscles
and inhibit detrusor contraction will be ultimately prepared to postpone
urination in a bladder retraining program.


FUNCTIONAL INCONTINENCE


The therapeutic approach is completely different for patients with dementia,
physical immobility, or both, producing functional incontinence. The goal
with this group of patients is not to improve bladder function but to prevent
wetness by reestablishing appropriate toileting. Whether patients live at home
or in an institutional setting, they are dependent on caregivers in their daily
living and for implementation of behavioral treatment. The major challenge
of treating this group of patients is gaining and maintaining the compliance
of the caregiver in providing treatment. Older adults with functional incontivnence
may or may not have any urinary tract dysfunction requiring other forms
of treatment. What they require in the way of behavior therapy is a program
of prompted voiding (Burgio, Engel, McCormick, Hawkins, &amp; Sheve, 1988;
Schnelle et al., 1983). Prompted voiding is a well-developed method that
increases the availability of toileting assistance, provides regularly scheduled
reminders (prompts) to use the bathroom, and provides encouragement through
reinforcement for appropriate toileting and periods of dryness. There are
several variations of the prompted voiding procedure. An example of specific
instructions for caregivers and institutional staff is presented in Table 16.5.

<b>Table 16.5</b> Instructions for Prompted Voiding


SOURCE: Adapted from Burgio, Engel, McCormick, Hawkins, and Sheve (1988).


Research on the use of prompted voiding has produced a wide range of
outcomes (Burgio et al., 1988; Burgio et al., 1990; Hu et al., 1989; Schnelle
et al., 1983; Schnelle et al., 1989). Much of the variability is attributable to
differences in patient populations. In studies of nursing home residents,
reductions are in the 10% to 20% range. When an effort is made to select likely
responders, better results are obtained (Schnelle et al., 1989). Because prompted
voiding is an environmental treatment administered by staff or caregivers,
gains are lost when the program is stopped. Therefore, it has become clear
that for this therapy to be effective over the long term, it will be necessary to
further develop and implement supervisory systems for staff management and
quality control (Burgio &amp; Burgio, 1989; Burgio et al., 1990).


<b>Conclusion</b>


Although it is clear that more extensive research is needed, enough data
exist to justify the application of behavioral methods in clinical practice.
Behavioral procedures alone or in conjunction with medical approaches are
known to be effective in the treatment of the major types of incontinence.
Currently, biofeedback procedures and other behavioral techniques are not
readily available to the vast majority of elderly people. Continence clinics are
well established in some countries but are less common in the United States.
This may be because the concept is relatively new, and much has yet to be
