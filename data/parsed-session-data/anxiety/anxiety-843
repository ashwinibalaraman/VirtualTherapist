BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I ended up working from home again today because the alarm went off and I just could not get out of bed. And because it's an hour drive, I could sleep for another hour if I work from home.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: So, I e-mailed my boss and said I wasn't feeling well. You know, it's mostly true. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...and worked from home. And again, was unproductive, probably no less productive than I would have been at work but... (PAUSE) And it's really frustrating. Dave and I had a big fight last night about buying me a new monitor for my office at home.
THERAPIST: Uh huh. [00:00:57]
CLIENT: Due to the nature of my work there's a lot of, it's called TAC (ph) computer assisted design.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: So there's lots of software. And at work I have two big 24 inch monitors.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And I'm accustomed to being able to see everything that's going on in you know, eight or nine different windows and have them tiled across two monitors. And at home I have one tiny seven year old crappy monitor that because it's old is fuzzy and no longer drifts (ph) and my laptop screen, which is also small. And I told Dave, "You know, I just want to buy two monitors so I can work from home and not worry about not being able to do work because of the monitor issue." Because...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Okay, so part of why I wasn't productive today was like general psychological stuff and that's actually the biggest part of it. But there's certainly a couple of tasks that I could have gotten done...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...if I had the screen.
THERAPIST: If you had the monitors. Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, I had five different tasks I needed to get done today and one of them I couldn't even attempt because I didn't have enough screen to see what I was doing. And it was just too difficult to use the software. And with the other four there were all kinds of problems. [00:02:04]
(PAUSE)
And Dave's perspective is, "Well that monitor that's on your desk, I used that professionally for three years. I don't know what's wrong with it." And I was like, "Well, you don't do visual stuff. Like, you don't need graphics because you're a software engineer."
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: "Like you just need to see texts and you look at texts."
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: "And you can look at texts on any sized monitor."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: "And I need to see pictures." That's different. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Right. Sure.
CLIENT: And it was just... I don't know. This is ridiculous because I'm working now. I'm getting my paycheck and figuring I could just go to Best Buy and find myself a monitor.
THERAPIST: Right. (inaudible at 00:02:49)
CLIENT: But for some reason... I don't know. I feel like I can't get it unless I have Dave's permission, which I kind of stupid. And you know, when other stuff has come up, when I wanted to buy things that were lower budget than a monitor. I mean a good monitor of the quality that I want is probably 400 bucks and two of them is double that, obviously. But for lower price tag items, Dave has always told me, you know, "Why are you asking my permission?" [00:03:11]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: "It's not my money. It's our money." But even when I wasn't working and wasn't pulling in a paychec..
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...he was like, "Just buy what you need."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: "I mean, within reason. Make sure we don't get withdrawn on the checking account."
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: But like... And so I don't know why he's actually, why he didn't say that this time. And I don't know, well I do know why I keep asking him for his permission to spend money. But I don't, I'm frustrated by the fact that I do even though I know better.
(PAUSE) [00:03:55]
THERAPIST: So say the last part again. I was thinking about the thing you just said before that. (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: That's okay. So (inaudible at 00:04:03) looking at the way my parents structured their marriage and the family finances...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and how, you know, mom couldn't even buy a 99 cent coffee without asking my dad for permission.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I totally understand...
THERAPIST: Where this comes from.
CLIENT: ...where this comes from. But it's really frustrating to me that like years of Dave telling me it this is absurd and (inaudible at 00:04:25) stop treating him like my father.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And years of me actively working on myself trying to debunk this.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: My first instinct is still, "I can't buy a monitor because Dave said it's a ridiculous expense."
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I feel like there's, there's two things that my brain is doing. One is trying to convince him that it's not a ridiculous expense.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Which shouldn't matter because two, I'm earning money and we have enough money in our budget for me to buy myself two monitors. I mean...
THERAPIST: Right. Yeah, I mean clearly this has nothing to do with how much money you guys actually have. [00:05:03]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I mean one piece of it has more to do with (PAUSE) sort of, wanting him to understand and buy into where you're coming from.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And I suspect that matters more than the monitors. I mean, maybe that struggle you're engaged in a lot and not because of what he's like.
CLIENT: Right. Maybe (inaudible at 00:05:55) not just him.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. The thing is if we both made less money spending $800 on a monitor would be a huge deal.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Right? [00:06:01]
THERAPIST: Sure. Purchasing a summer home...
CLIENT: (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: ...that would be different.
CLIENT: Right. I actually, a friend of mine wanted to be in a poetry magazine and they don't qualify for a bunch of awards in the literary field that they're part of because they don't pay the writers enough. And I really wanted to just tell them I'd subsidize them paying their writers pro-rates for a year. But that was enough money that I felt like I really did...
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: ...need Dave's permission. And he's like, "Are you fucking kidding me?" (LAUGHTER) So yeah, that would be up in the, not quite summer home.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Right. In that direction.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah and you know that is interesting in the way you put it in terms of needing his permission as opposed to like, deciding together, you know?
CLIENT: Right.
(PAUSE) [00:06:57]
THERAPIST: As though (PAUSE) he were the one with more authority...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...rather than more (inaudible at 00:07:15)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...more interested in collaborating.
CLIENT: Right. (PAUSE) Yeah. I'm frustrated with myself. I'm frustrated with myself often, it feels like. (PAUSE) And part of my mind can't focus on this conversation because I'm still pissed off about me (inaudible at 00:07:49) from work today.
THERAPIST: Yeah. What's up?
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:07:55) So I've been doing with stupid testing new CAD (ph) tools thing all weekend.
THERAPIST: Right. This is the thing...
CLIENT: It's been a nightmare
THERAPIST: ...that's not quite in the main line of your work but you have some time and they have some need so...
CLIENT: Yeah. Right.
THERAPIST: ...there you are. [00:08:01]
CLIENT: So I filed a bug report on Wednesday.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And Ted who is kind of an idiot and has been promoted past his level competency. Are you familiar with the Peter principle?
THERAPIST: I think I've heard of (inaudible 00:08:25)
CLIENT: Yeah. If you're good at your job you get promoted. If you're good at your job you get promoted. You keep getting promoted until you're bad at your job.
THERAPIST: (LAUGHTER)
CLIENT: Well once you've been promoted into a job beyond your level of competency that you're bad at there's not way to send you back down the ladder to the job you were good at.
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah.
CLIENT: So, so he's been promoted beyond his level of competency.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I submit this bug report and I don't even know, some dude in the CAD team is supposed to be responding to it. But I CCed Ted because... So there's the CAD and there's the environment. And so I'm doing (inaudible at 00:08:59)and the environment and the CAD interact in stupid ways and they're not appropriately decoupled. [00:09:00]
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And there's bad software design...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...and I could talk for hours about why this is wrong.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But. So, even though when I said, "I'm having a problem. You know, when I, the dropdown menu... What's the name of the tool you're filing the bug against?" (inaudible at 00:09:21) There's also a CC list.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I CCed Ted because he owns the environment. And I CCed my manager because he wants to be CCed on anything anyone anything his direct reports are working on.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Mostly so that if dumb asses and other groups are wasting his people's time, he can go yell at them for us. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: Yeah. I think Dave sees his primary function as our manager to yell at other managers who for political reasons we can't yell at ourselves who are wasting our time.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. That's good for you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think.
CLIENT: So Ted looks at my bug report and says, "This is a duplicate of a bug that Jones filed in June." And so he deletes my bug and copies my comment over to Jones's bug but Ted is an idiot and my bug is completely different from Jones's bug. Different observed behavior, different root causes, different steps in the software flow so like, there's they're completely different. [00:10:19]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Except that they both happen while using the tool 2ZB (ph) So like, they're both P2ZB (ph) bugs, okay.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But they're different, different qualities.
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: So in comes Ted G.who's the software dove (ph) who is supposed to be fixing this bug and Ted G. is also kind of an idiot.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And he starts trying to debug Jones's bug in my work directory. And then he sends an e-mail saying, "Well, I'm not seeing this bug you reported because I'm seeing this other bug." And then like, "So I'm not seeing this bug you reported." And he's talking about Jones's bug.
THERAPIST: Right
CLIENT: It's my bug.
THERAPIST: Even though what he's seeing is a bug you actually reported. [00:11:01]
CLIENT: And so...
THERAPIST: So he is reproducing your bug.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: He's just confused about what's what.
CLIENT: And it's like, four people replied...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...to him saying, "I've seen in this same bug that Constance (ph) reported that you're seeing Constance (ph) working directory."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "That's the bug we need to be working on."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And then he sends this really nasty, obnoxious e-mail saying, "I am really confused. I don't know what's wrong with but you sent me a link to a directory where there's a bug that you claim you saw but I'm seeing something different in the log files, and you know, "What do you want me to do about this?" And I was like... So that set me off.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Because I did everything right. I filed a good bug report because I have been trained in previous jobs on how to write good bug reports god dammit.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: And I have also been on the phone for an hour with corporate IT with a completely separate problem with my Outlook not accessing my exchange account.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:12:07) exchange server and as I last heard about it, we're not getting it. [00:12:09]
CLIENT: Yeah, the guy from IT called me this morning...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...and tried to walk me through it but it was just the usual corporate IT sob story that I'm sure hundreds of thousands of people could tell you about.
THERAPIST: Hmm. That bad, huh?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, IT is underfunded, understaffed.
THERAPIST: Right. That's what you were saying.
CLIENT: So I got a little bit testy and wrote back to him, "There are a couple of things causing confusion. The first is that there are two different behaviors being recorded on the same bug on the bug tracker. I don't care about the behavior Jones reported. I haven't seen it. I don't know how to generate a test case. The thing that you said that you saw in your e-mail at such and such timestamp, that's the behavior I'm reporting. That's the behavior I want corrected. And then I said, "As I wrote in my e-mail, in my comment on the bug, I copied and pasted what was printed to standard (ph) out. You're not seeing that text in the log files because the bug files don't match to standard (ph) out. And I'm not software dove (ph). I don't know why the people who ran this code decided to print things to the standard output (ph) terminal versus the log files. I can only report to you what I see."
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. [00:13:25]
CLIENT: And then I sent it and then a half hour later I felt bad for being a little bit rude, bitchy in my e-mail to him.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah. To which he replied, "You know, I just don't understand. My expertise is in the software stack (ph) not the tool use." To which I replied, "Look. (LAUGHTER) I wrote in the bug exactly the path to the directory and the steps, like the exact things you need to type into the command prompt to recreate this bug."
THERAPIST: Right. [00:14:01]
CLIENT: "You don't need to know how to use this tool."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And in fact the people who know how to use these tools can't debug the software because we're electrical engineers not software engineers.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Just so, so frustrated. (PAUSE) I don't think there's anything particularly meaningful or insightful in that though. I'm sure everyone gets frustrated with colleagues who are obtuse. (inaudible at 00:14:37)
THERAPIST: Well it is, it is pretty similar to what you were saying happened with... This isn't very different in what you were describing happened with Dave in that the issue with you're trying to make yourself clear...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ... and being completely misunderstood.
CLIENT: Right. [00:15:01]
THERAPIST: The other thing that pissed you off, I guess the different is that with Dave, you felt kind of down here rather than (inaudible at 00:15:11)
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Doesn't sound like how you felt and anyway maybe a little bit the opposite.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: ...with these two guys, Ted and the, I forgot the name of the other guy.
CLIENT: Ted.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: (inaudible at 00:15:25)
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I think another difference with the second one, as frustrating as it, is, is easier because you don't feel at fault.
CLIENT: Right. This is in no way my fault. [00:16:11]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And like, Ted might be mad at me but like, that's not that's not based in reality.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. (PAUSE) That's his problem.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I know that there are lots of people who think that I'm horribly arrogant. Possibly not yet at this job. But I know at other jobs people have explicitly called me arrogant. When I was in high school I was called arrogant by pretty much everyone. But (PAUSE) I don't know. I try very hard not to act like I'm better than other people.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But to have (PAUSE) kind of the ability to distinguish areas where I know what I'm doing...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...from areas where there are things that I can learn...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...or where I don't know what's going on. [00:17:11]
But I do worry in cases like this where I feel so certain that, you know, I clearly did the right thing and this person clearly is in the wrong that I'm slipping into the kind of behavior I had ten years ago, you know, ten years ago when I actually was a kind of arrogant overconfident stuck up bitch with an entirely too inflated opinion of myself.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: This is where it possibly being your fault starts to creep back in?
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
(PAUSE) [00:17:59]
THERAPIST: Another feature of these situations and I think a lot of the ones you talk about is that somebody's usually really fucking up and somebody else is really mad about it.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: Usually the person you describe who's really fucking is you but not always.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And (PAUSE) I think sometimes when it isn't you who is fucking up, like in the situation you're describing, I think you feel, I mean certainly frustrated, you said that.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. [00:18:59]
THERAPIST: And also pretty critical, I mean you're clearly saying that as well and then kind of bad about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like, "Okay. Let's say he's an idiot. No, let's say he isn't that smart."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, or he's not being conscientious. Or whatever it is.
CLIENT: Or his dog died or he's having a bad day. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I mean this is my only, well I know Ted is kind of an idiot because I've encountered him multiple times already.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But this is the first time I've dealt with this Ted so...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I don't even know what's going on with him.
THERAPIST: Right. It's, it's sort of like (PAUSE) somehow it's like a felony not a misdemeanor to be an idiot. (LAUGHTER) like it's like a big crime.
CLIENT: Yeah. Right.
THERAPIST: You know, and somebody sort of deserves a lot of criticism if they're being an idiot.
CLIENT: Mm hmm. [00:20:03]
THERAPIST: And then I think you feel bad for that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I guess it doesn't feel to me as you describe it like, sure it's frustrating to deal with somebody who just can't fix the problems that you have worked hard to explain very cleary and like thoroughly. But it seems like there's maybe a bit more an edge to it than just, "Oh this isn't getting fixed."
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Like there's another aspect of it about being really annoyed that he's such an idiot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like yeah sort of like it is a punishable offense to be an idiot.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I mean I think he definitely (inaudible at 00:21:01) too. But I'm sort of wondering about that. [00:21:01]
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:21:15)
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: I mean, certainly, going back to my parents because it always comes back to my parents. My parents believe that this is not being smart. Like not even just being abjectly bad at what you do or being stupid but just not being really really smart...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...is a really bad thing and kind of a moral failing which, you know, on an intellectual level I understand is wrong and that there should be no moral judgment attached to...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...raw intelligence and that smart people can be bad at their jobs and really smart people can do really terrible things et cetera, et cetera. [00:21:59]
THERAPIST: And it's not somebody's fault if they're not smart.
CLIENT: Right. (PAUSE) But I think I do have that knee jerk reaction of...
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: ..."Wow you're really stupid therefore you're not a worthwhile person," a lot of the time. And I try, I try really really hard to be aware of that and catch it.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: But I don't think I succeed all the time.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
(PAUSE) [00:23:01]
CLIENT: I remember my dad once explicitly saying that it was better to be an immoral person than a stupid person.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Yeah.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: That's horrible.
CLIENT: Yep.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I have this picture of him in my mind of like he's just clinging so tenaciously to his intelligence.
CLIENT: And yet, at the same time, my dad probably says, "You know, look how far I've come. I grew up in a refugee camp. I have an IQ of 65 but I'm a doctor and came to the U.S."
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: It's like, okay first of all, IQ tests are bullshit. Second of all, even if they weren't, my dad does not test at 65.
THERAPIST: Sure. [00:24:15]
CLIENT: I just like, there's just... (PAUSE) Like I think 65 is at the level of you cannot live independently and you need like a home health aide to survive.
(PAUSE) [00:25:00]
THERAPIST: I think mental retardation is defined as IQ below 70 so yeah... (PAUSE) I think. (PAUSE) So... (PAUSE) I, for what it's worth, like I don't actually tend to believe in like, sort of, habits and psychological inertia.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: I tend to believe more in, like dynamics. So let me explain how I think that applies to what I'm talking about .
CLIENT: Okay. [00:26:01]
THERAPIST: I, I hear what you're saying makes sense and in a way, I'm sure it's true that, you know, because this is something you grew up seeing all the time...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...it's something that you took on as well...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...even as you've tried not to...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you don't like it...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...about yourself. (PAUSE) I imagine that it may work more like this. Like, that I would say sort of a habit model and there are a lot of things that look that way and in a way it's true. I'm not bringing this up to try and quibble about theories. But, I suspect it's more like, I bet you get really anxious in situations where there are problems or things go wrong because somebody is going to be an idiot or an asshole and that's, you know, that's pretty scary. I mean, certainly growing up but even now too. I mean, if there's a problem and you're working on it with somebody. If it's not going right...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...you know, it's sort of dangerous if you find out it's you...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...like you can really take it out on yourself...
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: ...really harshly.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And so I think that makes it scary.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: And I imagine (PAUSE) one aspect of this anyway...
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...is that you manage that worry by kind of dumping that anger and criticism on somebody else when it feels like they are the ones who are responsible for the problem. [00:28:09]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Which, I mean, clearly there's still a habit in there so maybe I'm not entirely clear on my metatheory (ph) is or something.
CLIENT: Right. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: But, but it's based more on how these situations (PAUSE) I think involve a lot of anxiety.
CLIENT: Right. It's almost like the...
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:28:41)
CLIENT: ...fight or flight reaction gets triggered.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: When really, you know, a piece of software isn't working, that's problem but it shouldn't trigger like primitive panic reactions right?
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT Like where is that coming from? I don't know. [00:29:01]
THERAPIST: Well it can come from all sorts of things like it can make you helpless. It can make you feel at fault. It can prevent you from getting, I guess sort of inherently, it can prevent you from getting other things done that puts you in a vulnerable position vis-a-vis yourself and your boss or whoever.
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: I mean the stakes around those things aren't high.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Although I hear what you're saying about like, it's a piece of software not working right?
CLIENT: Right.[00:29:59]
THERAPIST: It's not like getting mugged or, you know, car crash, or...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...you know, being broke or something like that.
(PAUSE) [00:30:53]
CLIENT: Like this isn't even a component...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: ...that I own or have any responsibility for right? So I didn't write it. I don't maintain it and it's not my job to make sure it works. It's just my job to try it out and describe what happens when I try to use it. Like...
THERAPIST: Hmm. Like you're in the position of just sort of reporting the news.
CLIENT: Yeah.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: But it's still not hard to get tangled up in this other stuff.
CLIENT: Right. But it's just very frustrating to me that I can't figure out why it's broken even though that's not my job. (LAUGHTER) It's written in a language I don't know, part of an enormous system that I don't understand. A legacy system that's thousands of moving parts that are documented or described or defined well. Like there's no possible way that I or anyone with my skill set could possibly fix this problem. [00:32:01]
But it still bothers me that, you know, when I went and looked at the log files and then pulled up the source code for the software I couldn't figure out what was going on. But I mean it's written in a language I don't speak. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: I've never learned Pearl (ph) never ever and while certainly there's an argument to be had and many people are (inaudible at 00:32:37) that if you understand software fundamentals and computer science fundamentals whatever those are and know two or three languages you can pick up another language quickly. But it's still not trivial. [00:32:55]
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: And I guess you would mostly be doing or at least significantly because you wouldn't want to feel bad when there was something that you couldn't fix even if it was totally not your responsibility?
CLIENT: Right. And in fact if I did fix it I would be seen as stepping on toes of people in the other group. And also as a waste of my manager's budget. Right because you know...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Right. It's time away from other things.
CLIENT: Right it's spending engineering time on a CAD issue...
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Right.
CLIENT: ...when there are engineering tasks that need to be done. You know, I'm getting paid to do a set of tasks from the engineering bucket when not doing them. And that's...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...still on my manager's balance sheet. Right?
THERAPIST: Right. [00:34:01]
CLIENT: So even if I could fix this I'm not supposed to but I feel...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...feel bad that I can't figure out how to fix it.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Which is a problem.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I imagine if, again it's like something with the passivity there... [00:34:29]
CLIENT: Mm hmm.
THERAPIST: ...makes you really anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think also...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...I expect myself to be able to do anything that's thrown at me and that's I think pretty intricately tied to my self image.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: You know, when I was growing up, my distinguishing feature both at school and in my house was I was the smart one. I can solve any problem. I can excel at everything. You know, some people were really good at math. Some people were, you know, really good on the debate team. Some people were English classes. I was good at Math and Science and English and Social Studies.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: I could win competitions across the entire field of academic endeavors. And so getting to a point both in my education and in my career where I've specialized to the point where I can't do everything is, is very upsetting.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Especially because within my, my field I'm still learning the system...
THERAPIST: Right.
THERAPIST: ...and don't fully understand everything that's going on. And also this job isn't in the same field that I trained for in grad school. It's you know, a little bit...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...different. Which isn't to say I can't learn it but I don't know it yet and it's not...
THERAPIST: Yeah. Right so you're not even the person who's like really good at just one thing.
CLIENT: Right. I'm not good at anything right now. And that's very upsetting. (LAUGHTER)
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:36:15]
CLIENT: You know, I feel like an idiot every time I have to go to my mentor and be like, "Brian, I don't understand X, Y, Z. Can you explain it to me again." And I don't like that. I was like, "What would you think if you had a coworker who was in your cubicle two or three times a day, every day saying, you know, 'I don't understand (inaudible) I don't understand (inaudible) I still don't understand (inaudible) I need you to explain it again.' I need you to understand, you know, X, Y, X for the fourth time this month." And, you know Dave said, "Really, I would be glad they were coming to me with questions instead of wasting their time trying to figure it out on their own. Or worse, checking in code that breaks the build because they didn't understand. I would much rather that they ask me questions." [00:37:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And Dave said that's part of his job as a senior engineer to answer these questions.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I said, "That's really how you think?" Because I just, every time I have to go ask someone a question, I assume that what they're thinking is, "My God Constance (ph) is such an idiot. Why is she bothering me with this bullshit?"
THERAPIST: That's another aspect of it that I imagine. Let me back up. Yeah. Yeah. In some sense you're kind of always talking to your dad. (inaudible at 00:37:45)
CLIENT: Yeah
THERAPIST: Or like with me yesterday about the (inaudible).
CLIENT: Yep. [00:37:57]
(PAUSE)
It's not fair. I spent years trying to make myself feel okay with not talking to my real dad in real life and kind of dodging conversations with him and keeping it to kind of (inaudible) formalities and nothing else. And (LAUGHTER) only to realize that in every interaction with everyone, everywhere in my life, something in my brain acts like I'm talking to my dad.
THERAPIST: Not fair at all.
CLIENT: No.
(PAUSE)
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:38:53)
(PAUSE) [00:39:02]
[00:40:01]
THERAPIST: What were you just thinking about?
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: I was thinking of the stupid computer monitor situation again.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
(PAUSE)
CLIENT: I was actually thinking the monitor I had at Brown was really nice and I wish I had it bac [00:40:01]
The laptop and monitor I had at Brown were paid for with research funds and I expected them not to be my ideal laptop and monitor.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm.
CLIENT: When I decided to leave with a masters instead of (inaudible) I asked my advisor if I could just pay her for them so I could keep them.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: The new student could check (ph) out his own equipment.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: She got very angry that I would even suggest that and was like, "Research funding doesn't work that way. Accounting doesn't work that way. I can't do that." And I kind of took it personally because I thought that was a perfectly reasonable thing to ask for.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It's not like I wanted them for free.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I would have paid for them.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So yeah, I was kind of dwelling on that during that moment of silence.
(PAUSE) [00:42:01]
THERAPIST: (inaudible) another situation that (inaudible)
CLIENT: Mm hmm. Although to be honest, it's not as if I needed that kind of computing power for a personal laptop. It would have been a waste of money to keep it but it was really nice.
THERAPIST: And you wanted it anyway.
CLIENT: I wanted it anyway. My personal laptop is a third the price; it has maybe half the computing power.
THERAPIST: Uh huh.
CLIENT: But it's sufficient for my needs.
THERAPIST: Mm hmm. Are there things that would have been fun about the other one? [00:42:57]
CLIENT: Not even because I'm not a gamer and I'm not working on any coding projects right now. I'm not doing any image processing or graphics. It's not even as if I could make use of all the power.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:43:07)
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, what I use my computer for is connecting to work where everything runs on a server so I just need to run through a remote connection... Sorry.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And Internet processing and writing texts which none of which are (inaudible)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Those would actually significantly improve my work experience.
THERAPIST: Yeah so that's another thing to get over.
CLIENT: Okay. I have a number of coworkers who regularly work from home one day a week so at my next one on one with my manager I mean to ask if I can do that because it's just... Especially on Fridays when I have to leave early to get here. It's feels a little ridiculous.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:44:09]
CLIENT: I spend two hours if I'm only going to get five or six hours in the office and then...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...and then work from home in the evening. You know, if I had those six work hours plus the two hours I would have spent driving...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...to work and home, then I could be done with work when I got here instead of having to go home and log in and put in another two or three hours...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...at the end of the day.
THERAPIST: Yeah. (PAUSE) Well we can finish up for now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: We'll talk more this week.[00:45:01]
