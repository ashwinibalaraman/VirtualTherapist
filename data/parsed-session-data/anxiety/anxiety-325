<b>Howard R. Fradkin</b>


The AIDS crisis has affected men in
many ways, ranging from massive denial to panic to devastation to death.
While many diseases do not discriminate, AIDS is largely a disease of the
disenfranchised and outcasts of society. Gay and bisexual men, IV drug
users and multiple drug abusers, men of color, and hemophiliacs are the
ones singled out for the tragedy of AIDS. This chapter will describe the
psychosocial issues these men face as well as issues you may face as a
therapist. AIDS has attacked the masculinity of these men and these effects
will also be considered.


<b>A Brief History</b>


The AIDS crisis began in 1978 when
doctors in large urban areas observed some young gay patients with
unusual opportunistic infections. At first, it was believed some factor in the
gay lifestyle caused AIDS—AIDS was often called the "gay plague."
Doctors hypothesized that the immune systems of gay men had become
overloaded by multiple infections caused by having many sexual contacts,
using large quantities of drugs, and having irregular eating and sleeping
habits. Then in 1983, Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute obtained
a virus that he believed to cause AIDS. He named the virus LAV or
Lymphadenopathy-Related Virus. In May 1984, Dr. Robert Gallo of the
National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, also isolated an AIDS-related
virus, HTLV-III or Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus. After
much scientific and political debate, it was agreed to call the virus Human

<b>Epidemiology of AIDS</b>


Nearly all people with AIDS are in
one of the following seven risk groups: (1) homosexual/bisexual male—
66%; (2) intravenous (IV) drug abuser—17%; (3) homosexual male and IV
drug abuser—8%; (4) hemophilia/coagulation disorder—1% (5) heterosexual
cases—4%; (6) transfusion, blood/components—2%; and (7) none of
the above—3% (Centers for Disease Control, 1986). There have been no new
risk groups identified since mid-1982. Almost 95% of people who have been
diagnosed with AIDS are men. Of the cases, 22% are aged 20-29; 47% are
aged 30-39; 21% are aged 40-49; 9% are over 49 years of age; and 1% of
AIDS cases are children under the age of 13. In regard to racial/ethnic
background, 60% are white; 25% are black; 14% are Hispanic/Latino; 2%
are other or unknown. The overall mortality rate (death rate) is 54%, with
most men dying within three years of diagnosis (Centers for Disease
Control, 1986).


Belonging to one of these groups does not necessarily put a person at
high risk for contracting AIDS. It is believed that other risk factors may
influence and possibly weaken the immune system, either before or after
exposure to the virus. These factors may include having a high number of
sexual partners; poor personal and sexual hygiene practices; history of
sexually transmitted diseases including parasites and hepatitis B; history of
antibiotic use or heavy recreational drug use; persistently high psychological
stress; social and emotional isolation; lack of self-acceptance; inability
to express feelings and anger; and perhaps even genetic factors (Bahnson &amp;
Engelman, 1981; Cecchi, 1983; Guiot, 1984).


<b>What Is AIDS?</b>


AIDS stands for Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome. A syndrome is a group of clinical symptoms that
make up a disease or abnormal condition. A variety of symptoms are
characteristic of the disease; however, not all symptoms appear in any one
person. The virus causes breakdowns in the immune system, which then
allows frequently occurring germs the opportunity to multiply freely,
causing "opportunistic diseases." Infection with HIV has varied body

[p. <i>252</i>]

The symptoms of AIDS include: unexplained fevers; shaking chills or
drenching night sweats; persistent diarrhea; unexplained persistent fatigue;
unexplained swollen glands; pink to purple flat or raised blotches
occurring on or under the skin, inside the mouth, nose, eyelids, or rectum;
persistent white spots or unusual blemishes in the mouth; and a persistent
dry cough not caused by a common respiratory infection.


The most common opportunistic diseases that occur in men with AIDS
are a rare form of cancer called Kaposi's Sarcoma, or KS, and a pneumonia
called Pneumocystis Carinnii Pneumonia, or PCP. Both of these diseases
are often treatable, as are virtually all opportunistic infections. The
difference between AIDS and ARC is that persons with ARC have not yet
been diagnosed with an opportunistic disease. With either diagnosis, it is
possible to appear apparently well and work, be acutely ill, or be
chronically ill and have great difficulties in daily living.


Neurological complications are estimated to occur in at least 30% of
persons with AIDS (PWAs), and in 10% of PWAs these complications are
the initial clinical problem (Bresden &amp; Messing, 1983; Snider, Smith, &amp;
Nielson, 1983). Early symptoms include loss of concentration and recent
memory, mental slowing, unsteady gait, uncoordination, social withdrawal,
and apathy. Navia (1986) has found some clients may develop
AIDS Dementia Complex without developing full-blown AIDS. A
detailed neurological history and formal neuropsychological testing are
necessary to establish a diagnosis.


<b>Psychosocial Issues</b>


Imagine youself going to your doctor's
office and being told that you have a diagnosis of AIDS. Allow
yourself to imagine the wide range of feelings you might have. Now consider
you're told you have ARC. Think about the tremendous range of feelings
and thoughts you might be having. Now imagine being exposed to Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, what is this like for you?


This portion of the chapter will deal with how men with AIDS, ARC,
HIV Positive, and the rest of the "worried well" are affected by the AIDS
crisis. Specific emphasis will be placed on how the disease affects us as men.


<b>PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES</b>


<b>OF PERSONS WITH AIDS</b>


The best way to describe the process
of counseling and dealing with a diagnosis of AIDS is the analogy of riding

[p. <i>253</i>]

<i>Phase 1: Engagement and assessment</i>. The development of AIDS is
totally unpredictable. Some men have been sick for some time before
receiving their diagnosis. For others, the warning signs come only a short
time before diagnosis. Therefore, it is hard to know what to expect in your
initial interactions with a PWA. It is important to allow the client to ride on
the roller coaster and just experience whatever feelings he may be having.
This is not the time for confrontation, interpretation, or giving advice.
Allow the dust to settle as the man begins to deal with the reality of his
diagnosis. Denial may be present to a large degree. A man may talk with
great bravado about how he is going to be the first one to survive and
conquer this disease. Support the denial until your client is ready to face the
range of emotions that come with such a devastating diagnosis.


Many issues will come to the surface in this early period. Most PWAs
have led a fairly independent life prior to diagnosis, having their own
apartments and working in careers or full-time jobs. These men may have
to face dependency for the first time in their adult lives. There are often
great fears associated with this as well as a loss of pride in being able to take
care of oneself.


For men in committed relationships, the fear of becoming more
dependent and possibly a burden on their partner is particularly difficult.
The couple may face financial problems if the PWA is unable to continue
working. The PWA may fear rejection from his lover or have to face the
disturbing possibility he has transmitted the disease to his partner.


The issue of disclosure is a major one with regard to friends, family, and
work associates. Employer reactions have varied from immediate firing to
great compassion. Family reactions also vary from tremendous support to
complete rejection. Within the gay community, "gay families" frequently
have been extremely supportive, but there are also instances of rejection
and stigmatization.


Another immediate reaction to diagnosis may be the belief that they are
being punished. Many talk about being a "slut" or drug abuser and
therefore deserving of AIDS. Some blame it on being gay or bisexual. Even
previously well-adjusted gay men succumb to increased internalized
homophobia. It is important to confront this judgment and help these men

[p. <i>254</i>]

<i>Phase 2: Assisting and supporting autonomy</i>. Typical of men, it is often
hard for PWAs to ask for help, whether it be financial, emotional, or to
meet basic needs. Depending on the client's physical condition, some
PWAs may need a great deal of assistance with basic living skills, while
others may be more independent. While it can be tempting for the
counselor to preempt the autonomy of the client as a response to our own
helplessness, it is important to encourage the client to be as autonomous as
possible. Clients can get very angry when their autonomy is taken away.


<i>Phase 3: Explaining the therapeutic relationship and meaning of AIDS</i>.
The issue of a PWA's continuing dependence is important to address. The
PWA is likely to feel ambivalent; while he may appreciate the counselor
being there, he may also resent dependence on the counselor and envy the
counselor's health. The counselor may be pulled close and then pushed
away. It is often difficult for men with AIDS to believe people could really
care about them as human beings because of the stigmatization. In this
weakened physical and psychological state, clients may internalize this
stigmatization, leading to feelings of powerlessness and helplessness.


It is essential to empower the client in every way possible. Encourage
him to confront people who withdraw, affirming his right for support.
Encourage assertiveness in hospital settings. Help clients ask for explanations
of tests and options, including alternative treatment modalities. Help
them recognize and assert their right to be treated with respect, not as a
freak or leper. Affirm the client's right to determine his own limits and help
him learn to listen to his body. Let him decide how much exercise and sleep
he needs.


Empowerment includes letting PWAs know they can survive a diagnosis
of AIDS. A New York study (Rothenberg, 1986) found people with AIDS
who survive more than three years face a decreasing probability of dying
from the disease. During the fourth year, there is a leveling off of the
probability of dying, and after that time the probability appears to
approach zero. The study also noted optimal survival occurred among
young, white gay men with Kaposi's Sarcoma. Another study being
promoted by the national PWA organization has found that 20% of people
with AIDS live longer than the three years predicted as the average life span
for those who are diagnosed (Lorenzini &amp; Reynolds, 1982). The study
found a number of characteristics of long-term survivors: the ability to
externalize the disease, explore alternatives, take responsibility for their
own health, say "no," and focus on making life productive. With this kind
of information, some clients are able to mobilize their defense system more
effectively.


<i>Phase 4: Supporting the client in talking about death</i>. At first, death may
be referred to through indirect comments the client makes. For instance, he

[p. <i>255</i>]

During this phase, it is common for clients to spend time reminiscing
about the past and contrasting the future as being very dim. The roller
coaster effect is still noticed as clients range from laughing with friends to
being deeply depressed.


Also during this time, clients may take a look at their present and past
relationships and determine whether it is still possible to work on any of
these relationships and resolve past problems. It has been hypothesized
that such therapeutic work may enhance the immune competence of PWAs
(Bahnson &amp; Engelman, 1981).


<i>Phase 5: Monitoring and maintaining health status</i>. Regardless of
whether a person with AIDS is hospitalized, it is important to monitor and
maintain the health care received. Help the PWA advocate for quality care
when possible. Lowered self-esteem and increased weakness may inhibit
their ability to ask for care they deserve.


Anger is a normal emotion in any of these phases. The PWA may be
angry at any number of things, from the injustice of the disease, the lack of
governmental response, or concrete frustrations such as the doctor not
having answers. It is important to validate the anger while helping the
PWA vent it to help decrease anxiety and depression levels. Anger can also
be channeled into constructive activities including work in PWA and
AIDS organizations.


<i>Phase 6: Supporting close relationships and griefwork</i>. Generally the
PWA has a sense of when death is near. Although the PWA may desire
support from his closest friends and family, they may feel threatened and
scared to come around. They may not want to face his impending death, or
understand the PWA's sense of relief that the struggle is almost over. The
PWA will also be dealing with much grief and loss, including the loss of
respect and dignity, career, friends and lover, and bodily functions or
mental functions.


Planning for death may occupy a lot of the PWA's attention. Some
PWAs will want to die at home. With community task forces and health
care, this often can be arranged. Referrals to lawyers and others who can
assist in making final plans may also be needed. It is important to consider

[p. <i>256</i>]

<i>Phase 7: Caring and advocating for the dying client</i>. It is important to
continue to advocate for the PWA in his last days and hours. If the person
is at home, assure that adequate care is given. If the person is in the
hospital, the therapist can help assure that the PWA will die with dignity.
The PWA may be unconscious and unable to communicate directly.
However, he may be able to hear and recognize voices. Take this time to say
goodbye to the client. This is also a time to care for the significant others in
the PWA's life. Frequently these people will have very intense feelings that
need to be vented. Some may still be in denial and need assistance in letting
go.


<i>Phase 8: Grieving and mourning with the family and significant others</i>.
Even after the PWA dies, your role continues to be important as family and
significant others grieve the loss. In the case of a gay man who dies, there
may be significant issues and problems that arise during the planning of the
funeral, the funeral itself, and the mourning time that follows. If the man
had a lover, he may be excluded from giving any input regarding the
funeral unless he has the power of attorney.


After the funeral, the family may want to blame the lover for the death of
their son. It may be important to help the lover to stand up for himself and
not allow family members to take advantage of him.


<b>PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES OF</b>


<b>MEN WITH AIDS-RELATED</b>


<b>COMPLEX</b>


A diagnosis of ARC can be just as
devastating as a diagnosis of AIDS. For some men diagnosed with ARC, it
comes after a longer period of seeing their health go downhill without
doctors being able to diagnose them. It may be a relief to receive a diagnosis
and know what they are fighting against. Others have confirmed their
exposure to the virus through antibody testing and have felt like walking
time bombs hoping they would not develop ARC, but expecting to be
diagnosed. A diagnosis of ARC means an uncertain future. Some men will
develop a full-blown case of AIDS. While some will remain in a very
weakened state, others will recover.


One of the most comprehensive studies comparing affective reactions of
men with AIDS and ARC found the psychosocial needs of people with
ARC (PWARCs) have been greatly underestimated (Mandel, 1985).

[p. <i>257</i>]

Other factors contribute to greater emotional distress. Half of PWARCs
had not discussed their health problems with one or more family members
(Mandel, 1985). This was often associated with a lack of disclosure to their
families with regard to their sexual orientation. For men who had disclosed
their health, PWARCs reported more negative experiences in the disclosure
than PWAs. Consistent with this, PWARCs feared rejection more than
PWAs. Increased internalized homophobia was found in 25% of PWARCs
(Mandel, 1985).


Working on developing a positive attitude can make a difference in how
PWARCs cope with the disease. Hay (1984) talks about the importance of
loving and forgiving oneself and working on positive relationships. She
encourages her clients to use self-hypnosis, meditation, creative visualization,
and "mirror talk" to improve their abilities to love themselves. Men
with ARC may believe their chances for intimacy are greatly decreased
because no one would want to get close to them. While some men may
reject them, others will want to get close and share in the experience of
caring for and loving a man with ARC.


<i>The AIDS antibody test</i>. Men can now go to an anonymous, confidential
clinic to find out if they have been exposed to HIV. It is important in
counseling individuals about taking the test to help them look at the
potential consequences both emotionally and behaviorally. For some
clients, taking the test may be contraindicated because of the extreme
anxiety they already feel without knowing their antibody status. For
others, it may help to decrease their anxiety if there is little reason to believe
they have been exposed and they find out they are negative. The results of
testing have been studied by the San Francisco AIDS Health Project. They
found 57% of men tested indicated they had improved risk reduction at
least somewhat, while 35% said their behaviors had not changed since
taking the test (Dlugosch, Gold, &amp; Dilley, 1986); 1% of the participants said
their activities had become somewhat less healthy since taking the test.
With regard to mood changes, the authors concluded, "Taking the test has
a powerful impact on the emotional state of a person, with the expected
outcome of great relief and mood improvement for those receiving negative
results and heightened anxiety and depression for those with positive
results" (Dlugosch et al., 1986, p. 2).


Ongoing counseling either individually or in groups may help men learn
more positive ways of coping with the natural stress of being exposed to
AIDS. It is important to help these men establish a positive outlook
because of the danger of setting themselves up to get the disease.

[p. <i>258</i>]

While the gay community appears to be responding more positively to
safe sex guidelines, the greater concern arises about the spread of the
disease in the heterosexual and the IV drug community. These communities
have been more difficult to reach and it is important for all men who are
sexually active or involved within the drug subculture to recognize the
great risks they are taking.


<b>Psychosocial Issues</b>


<b>of Special Populations</b>


<b>BISEXUAL MEN</b>


The AIDS crisis has presented some
unique issues for bisexual men, particularly those who have ongoing
relationships with women. Many bisexual men have lived on the fringes of
the gay subculture, resulting in a lack of access to appropriate information,
resources, and support for themselves. With the onset of the AIDS crisis,
these men may not have appropriate information about safe sex and other
precautions that could help them protect themselves and their partners.


Many bisexual men in the past have been able to rationalize their outside
relationships by telling themselves they posed no danger to themselves or
their partners. But now, facing the reality of possible infection often leads
to increased anxiety and guilt. Some bisexual men have chosen to cope by
refraining from any further activity with other men, causing them to feel
unfulfilled and depressed.


The crisis that bisexual men face when they test positive for the HIV
virus or are diagnosed with ARC or AIDS can be quite traumatic.
Frequently, many of these men have not been open with their partners
about the extent of their homosexual activity. Therefore, they face a dual
"coming out" to their partners.


<b>THE WORRIED WELL</b>


As the AIDS crisis progresses, the
worried well comprise a greater number of people in the community. The

[p. <i>259</i>]

The impact of AIDS crisis on the worried well has been incredibly
dramatic. For gay men, it has meant a total reevaluation of the gay lifestyle.
For many, the 1970s represented a time when gay liberation was at its height
and gay men were beginning to feel positive about themselves for the first
time. The AIDS crisis hit at the end of this period, causing many gay men to
take a hard look at how they were living their lives. Jim is a typical example.


Jim has been an active man in the New York gay community for many
years. In 1978 his physician was one of the first to hear about the incidence
of Kaposi's Sarcoma and expressed concern to him. Jim told his friends
and they labeled him an alarmist. His physician updated him, but his
friends continued to discount him. Several years later, Jim and his friends
began to face the reality of AIDS. Some chose to become celibate, while
others denied the danger. Jim decreased the number of his sexual partners.
A year later, some of Jim's friends were diagnosed with ARC and AIDS.
Jim learned about safe sex, but found it difficult to change his behavior.
He'd never used condoms before and felt awkward talking to his partners
about using condoms. At a seminar, he learned safe sex is equal to caring
about yourself and your partner. He began to approach sex with a more
positive attitude, and recognized that AIDS was probably going to be a
part of his life forever. It is eight years since his doctor's first warning; now
when he visits friends who have AIDS, he knows just by looking in their
eyes when they are going to die. Some of his friends are just going crazy
bouncing back and forth between wanting to take care of themselves and
being self-destructive. He ranges from anxiety and panic to feeling like a
hypochondriac to depression and severe anger and rage at the government's
inability and unwillingness to put all their resources together to fight this
disease. He's also frustrated because he really doesn't know who to believe
in regard to the facts about AIDS.


<b>MINORITY MEN</b>


AIDS as an issue in the black and
Latino communities has been kept in the closet, largely due to the myth that
AIDS is a white man's disease (Gerald, 1986). In reality, 39% of people with

[p. <i>260</i>]

The most important issue to encourage treatment as soon as symptoms
are apparent. Saxon (1986) describes the "post-diagnosis syndrome" in
which blacks are very angry about their diagnosis. AIDS is particularly
difficult for a professional black man because he may feel "They finally got
me." It is important to validate this anger while being compassionate and
patient with the PWA. It is typical for minority PWAs to be very confused
and frightened, partly due to inadequate explanations from their physicians.
It is important to support the PWA in helping him get needed
medical information to ease his confusion.


In regard to the reactions of families, Latino families tend to give
support once they get over the initial shock (Paniagua, 1986). This family
acceptance is true only for Hispanics who are acculturated. Hispanics who
are "undocumented" have generally left home to be free and do not contact
their family upon diagnosis. In the black family, the PWA may die alone.
Frequently the black mother is afraid to let her son come home or feels
unable to provide financially for the son because of already strained
resources (Paniagua, 1986; Saxon, 1986). It is common with the black
PWA to claim to be an IV drug user rather than gay or bisexual because he
perceives this may be more acceptable to his family.


In terms of ongoing care and financial support for both black and
Hispanic P WAs, it is important for therapists to recognize the likelihood of
institutional racism affecting the quality of care. The therapist needs to be
an advocate for the PWA when the possibility of such discrimination
occurs. State disability is limited by what the person paid into it, and
typically blacks and Latinos have paid in less and therefore receive even
fewer benefits than the typical white client.


<b>IV DRUG AND MULTIPLE</b>


<b>DRUG USERS</b>


There is still a controversy over
whether multiple drug abuse is a major causative factor in the development

[p. <i>261</i>]

<b>CLINICAL ISSUES WITH</b>


<b>DRUG ABUSERS</b>


Spiegel (1986) argues it is important
for PWAs to have a choice as to how to live their life, including whether to
become sober. She sees substance abuse treatment as a quality-of-life issue,
and emphasizes that although there are many issues for a PWA to face, the
therapist may need to deal with chemical dependency before the client can
be helped to deal effectively with other psychosocial stressors. Timing is an
important issue, particularly because the PWA at diagnosis may already be
in the denial mode and therefore be hard to confront about a chemical
dependency problem.


Spiegel also suggests discussing the increased risk that drug abusers face,
including the danger of blood-to-blood contact and the immunosuppressant
qualities of drugs, particularly amylnitrate (poppers). Heterosexuals
need to know the AIDS virus is highly transmissible to unborn children.


AIDS education organizations have been very divided in terms of their
approach to reaching the drug abusing community. While Spiegel argues
that the number-one priority should be to stop drug abuse, it is important to
recognize that drug abuse will continue. Therefore, it is important to
provide education about safe needle practices and how to "clean the
works."Teaching drug agencies about AIDS is important so that in-house
education to clients can be provided.


<b>Issues for Therapists</b>


The therapist who chooses to work in
the AIDS crisis will face some of the biggest challenges in his or her career.
The ability to remain open to our feelings is extremely important in this
work. Difficult feelings such as helplessness, anger, and fear are necessary
to work through in order to stay open to our clients (Forstein, 1984;
Romano, 1985). Without working through such feelings, it is likely the
therapist may tend to smooth over the pain of the client in order to smooth
over his or her own pain.


A number of other abilities are desirable for the therapist. It is important
to have a comfortable respect for the human spirit and be able to accept and
discuss spirituality. It is important to be comfortable with death and dying
issues. Regardless of orientation, it is important to be open to the use of

[p. <i>262</i>]

Most important for any therapist is the necessity to arrange for some
type of supportive therapy or networking in order to assist with the healing
process of this work. Therapists often experience the same roller-coaster
phenomenon as clients. With supervision, it is possible to determine what
may be healthy coping mechanisms and what dynamics may be getting in
the way. The need to mourn a number of deaths in a relatively short time
can be difficult and painful. When mourning is not successfully completed,
the dangers of burnout are very real.


<b>Resources for Counselors</b>


In most larger cities, a counselor will
be able to draw on the resources of local AIDS task forces (Furstenberg &amp;
Olson, 1984). These task forces, which include both health professionals
and laypeople, have organized and trained groups of volunteers and
"buddies" to reduce the isolation of people with AIDS and provide basic
assistance to them with daily living skills and emotional support. Many
task forces have employed social service advocates who have experience
and connections with the health-care system and economic assistance
programs. Such task forces may also provide groups for people with AIDS,
their significant others, and groups for the worried well. A listing of all
existing task forces is available through the Shanti Project in San
Francisco (1986). The same document also lists a number of groups that
have been established for PWAs.


There are several useful guides for people with AIDS as well (Los
Angeles AIDS Project, 1985; O'Hara, 1984). These publications provide
guidelines for how to live a better-quality life. Most AIDS organizations
have also developed pamphlets that can be useful in direct work with
PWAs as well as with the community. A number of videotapes have also
been developed for training purposes. The Shanti Project has videotaped
their entire training program, which is tremendously useful as an adjunct to
local trainers. Also recommended is "Aids: Care Beyond the Hospital,"
developed by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (1984), and training

[p. <i>263</i>]

Many governmental economic assistance programs are available to
PWAs and PWARCs. I suggest developing a liaison with professionals
within these agencies to assist in getting aid as quickly as possible for
clients.


<b>Summary</b>


It has been difficult to present all of
the immensely complex issues surrounding this crisis adequately. Clearly, a
mutlidisciplinary, multidimensional approach is necessary in order to meet
the needs of the many thousands of people who have been and will be
affected by this crisis. While there is hope on the horizon that medical
progress will be made, the psychosociological aspects of the AIDS crisis
will have an impact on our society and particularly on men's lives for many
years to come. The AIDS crisis provides an opportunity for men to work
through a number of difficult issues. It is hoped that through this process
we will increase our ability to relate more openly to all men and women.
