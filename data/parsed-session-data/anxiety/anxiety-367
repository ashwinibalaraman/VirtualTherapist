I was taken to the examination room, told to remove my
clothing, and put on a hospital gown. I was terrified. I had
only recently had a thorough examination and thought this
to be an unnecessary procedure. Dr. Schoen was standing
there with a sympathetic look on his face.


Of course, the reflexes must be tested. Tap. Tap. Tap.
They were still there. There was a reaction.


Dr. Schoen tested my blood pressure, my heart, and my
ears. He looked into my eyes. He made a quick test for
lumps in my breasts. He tapped on my back. Then he seemed
to be ready for a more thorough examination.


"There is no need for an internal examination," I said
"I was examined by an obstetrician only two months ago.
I don't think that it is necessary again."


I do not know whether Dr. Schoen had planned to examine
me further, but nevertheless he seemed to heed my pleas.
Somehow, it seemed to me to be improper for my psychiatrist
to give me a physical examination.


The following day I suffered a severe anxiety attack
which I believe stemmed from the physical examination.
