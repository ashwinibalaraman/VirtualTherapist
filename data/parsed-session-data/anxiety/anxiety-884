BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
 CLIENT: There wasn't really even damage. The [inaudible [00:00:23] was good. I ended up canning the hundred pounds of tomatoes that I bought.
THERAPIST: Oh wow. My gosh; that's a lot of tomatoes.
CLIENT: Yeah, it just...when I was buying it, it didn't...you buy it by the box and it didn't sound as much. I was like yeah, four boxes. And each box was 25 lbs. So like that was really good to get done. 
So one thing that...
THERAPIST: I'm sorry. I think your fly is a little...
CLIENT: Yes. These pants are ...thank you. [Pause.] So my roommate Ashby has been, I don't know; so she had a complete freakout over turning 30. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: As it turns out, she'd actually been freaking out about it since summer and just hadn't revealed that. Yeah, and possibly earlier. I don't really know. But one thing I've noticed that I've sort of been feeling a little uncertain about like whatever. So typically over the last two or three years like on Sunday afternoon, either every week or every other week, she does a bunch of like kitchen cleaning and does lunch prep for making homemade lunch. And so she usually cleans a chunk of the kitchen. I hand wash all the dishes because she hates washing dishes. The dishwasher and I try to stay out of her way when she's cleaning because she hates if someone else is in there. 
[00:02:33]
So that's; she's completely stopped doing that. And I'm not sure...like I didn't notice really when, but she hasn't been doing it at least all summer. Yeah, and I'm like well, huh. It's kind of...to me it's like kind of weird. I liked her cleaning periodically. And I kind of feel weird saying, "Hey, you used to clean the kitchen more. Could you...?" I just not...even the most like, "Could you do that?" Although I would love her to go back and cleaning the kitchen, I'm kind of like what's wrong? Like so, I don't know, like April, May, she told me that she didn't want to do anything with the garden this year. And I said fine, I'll just do it all, which is fine. And that she really didn't; she would water, and that was about it. And that's like if I reminded her. But I was like, okay, whatever. I didn't do much gardening stuff last summer. 
But like I don't know. It's kind of hard like...I feel like...she starts taking Ritalin...is it Ritalin? For ADHD basically. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, Ritalin. 
CLIENT: And she...
THERAPIST: Although sometimes it is prescribed for depression. 
CLIENT: Yes, so she started taking Ritalin and started taking this anticonvulsant to make her sleep. And after that, she was saying; she was [inaudible [00:04:30] and I feel like I really don't want all that energy. I just want to keep things clean a lot. And so it's a little uncomfortable in that. I'm like it's not really what I signed on for as a roommate. Like I'm not going to be cleaning a lot because I'm not taking Ritalin now. 
THERAPIST: Right, but when did she say that? A while ago. 
CLIENT: It was probably like four years ago. A little after we moved in to our apartment together. Yeah, so it was like a while ago. And it as kind of funny because she's like, "Now that I sleep, I suddenly realize that I do care about cleaning." 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And then it would be complicated like don't be too crazy about this or that. But she just really hasn't been cleaning. Like doesn't take out the trash. Will like leave like food, like empty, like ice cream container or like food stuff just in the living room, which she's never done before. [Pause.] And like the last time I was cleaning up, because a house guest was coming, we were like, sooner or later, if there is cleaning for house guests like who's ever guests it is does most of the work. And she just didn't at all, which was...I wasn't mad. I was just kind of surprised that she just sort of sat while I was like cleaning everything. [Pause.]
[00:06:28]
I sort of like; I have to like sort of sets of concerns. Like one is as I think about it more, it's like wow; it's kind of big change in behavior to just, I don't know. Like be sort of "I'm not going to clean anymore." It's a big change, especially since she's talked about how she actually likes things being clean. And also just like leaving empty food containers around. Like that's actually my huge peeve, but that's not something she's ever done before. I hate people leaving food and trash in the living room. It should go in the kitchen in the trash. So I'm kind of like so is...like are you okay? Are you feeling depressed? Are you still freaked out about your birthday? 
THERAPIST: What the???
CLIENT: Yeah. But I'm also kind of terrified of asking what's up for reason I talked about before, but also she's, one of her things is she's very insistent that if I ask her how she's doing, I can't stop the conversation for a while. Like her doing to me; like mixing or giving me a list of reasons why I shouldn't die is not a reason to just step out of the conversation. If you ask; you shouldn't ask if you don't want to know. No, I'm okay, but. That's something that can start conversations. [Pause.] So I'm a little worried about her, but also like I don't know how to talk to her about it without her freaking out. [Pause.] 
THERAPIST: And is your...? [Pause]...sort of major concern is that, that you're worried about her. And there's also the fact that it was kind of nice when she cleaned up, although, most of it, it's not stuff you feel like you can ask her to do really. Maybe not to include the living room. 
CLIENT: Yeah, sort of thinking like it was nice when she did it, and the other problem is that so she would get like to scrubbing like the counters and the stove and I would wash like all the pots and pans and all that stuff. So if she's not doing any of it, then I'm still doing all the pots and pans I was before plus loading and unloading the dishwasher plus like cleaning off the counter. So I feel like there's suddenly more that I'm doing even though like I never asked her to scrub the kitchen obsessively and she never asked me to do the dishes, but I know she hates it so...and I felt like well, if you're doing this, I'm doing that. Like that's fair.
[00:10:17]
So everything is kind of like...
THERAPIST: [inaudible 10:19].
CLIENT: Yeah, it feels like kind of like she's...I don't know. A little bit checked out of the living together. Like... [Pause], I guess, I don't know. Like the things that roommates like do like someone takes down the trash. Someone replaces the toilet paper. Like I don't feel like she's doing her share of that, I guess. [Pause.] So yeah, I feel she's not pulling her weight and part of it is just like how I tend...like I like to live with roommates where we don't have an explicit [inaudible [00:11:24]. It's kind of like you know; just sort it out. And she's not like...she's kind of like not doing anything. She stopped doing like room house related things, like the cleaning and basic things.
So our landlord...I personally fell through our rotting first floor porch. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, that was like...I remember that. Yeah, that was like...
CLIENT: May or June.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I also forgot I never mentioned that to the physical therapist. That's something that might be of interest, which I should.
THERAPIST: Possibly.
CLIENT: Yeah, it affected my whole right side, which is the part that hurts. But so, we've been talking about how Ashby and I were like you know, there's this big scar across the front of our house where there's no paper, there's no shingles, there's just the wood at the house. And we can see through; like you can see light through parts of it. 
[00:12:40]
THERAPIST: Wait, so I hear...so you mean from inside the house. 
CLIENT: No, from the outside. Like if you're standing outside the house, right, and it's a bright day, you're like, "Oh look." I can kind of see through part of the interior of the house. And it's not weather tight. Because like you can just...people can look all through the house. It's at the front, and there are a couple of cables that are capped off that we don't know what are, or if they're well capped off or...so you said he was going to replace it by the end of the summer, and he hasn't. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: Because now it's like we would like you to do something about that because winter. Like it's not. And also he replaced kind of the door ring out to the porch and he replaced that with, the exterior door with a door that's not [inaudible [00:13:46] quite. It's smaller than the frame. And there's no weather stripping; it's just a door. An interior door. I don't think it's an exterior door. 
So we would like him to do some things and I talked to Ashby because she knows more about complaining to the city or state about crappy landlords and now she keeps on not wanting to call. Like she's gone from like yeah, to I got a call for an energy audit and this is not anything. And so now when I ask her, she's just been like, "Oh I should do that," "I don't want to." Like very just I don't want to and I'm sort of like, well okay, but you're also complaining about...she doesn't want to do it, but she's also complaining about the fact that our house is exposed and it's not well [inaudible [00:14:46]. [Pause.]
[00:14:50] 
And I brought it up again Monday, yesterday, and again, she just sort of whined about how she should do that, but she didn't want to. But she also like won't give me the information. I asked her if she wanted to talk about like, do you want to withhold rent, which, you know, do we want to like buddy up with the neighbors downstairs and have a unified where we're each withholding like $100 a month or whatever.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And again, she just was very like, "I guess." "I don't want to," "It's so..." like she really just didn't feel like doing it. It was too complicated, too annoying. She just doesn't feel like it. Which is also weird. Like normally she gets really—when we first started talking about it, she was really in to the idea of doing an energy audit and then the state would give a long list of what you have to fix and like blah, blah, blah. And would further improve our rent withholding situation. And so in both, like wow, you really change your interest mood whatever screwing over our landlord or whatever. And also, I would like to do this, and can you say yes or no. Are you going to do it or are you not going to do it? [Pause.] 
[00:16:32] 
I just sort of, I mean I am kind of...I am a little concerned. Like I am concerned that I feel like she's had these behavior changes. I feel like she's...it seems [inaudible [00:16:48] and she tends to hide that a lot. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Has she been in this mode before?
CLIENT: Yes, sort of. So one time, it was a couple of years ago, she was trying a new antidepressant and I had been away on vacation or something. So I came back and she started to explain how she...so basically she was feeling suicidal, but instead of saying that, what she said is that she had figured out she decided to save like three months rent and tell her parents to give it to me if she died for whatever reason so that I would have a cushion for finding a new roommate. And that's basically what she said to me. And I was like, "Ashby, what are you talking about? What is happening?" And I got out of her that she was feeling suicidal and she didn't want to talk to her psychiatrist. She didn't want to talk to her therapist. [Pause.] And I kind of...I mean, I had a shit fit about it. And I think threatened to call her best friend and have her have a shit fit as well. So she [inaudible 18:30] for several days before she was like, okay, I guess I'll go to my psychiatrist.
THERAPIST: Right, and tell her.
CLIENT: And switch medication.
THERAPIST: Right. 
[00:18:44]
CLIENT: So yeah, I'm a little worried that that's just going to pop out again because there wasn't really a worrying. Like from my point of view I was like, wow, she mentioned that she was trying a new antidepressant. She was like, oh, let me know if you...I'm like okay. I was like well you seem a little, you know, a little off, but it's the middle of the winter, you know. Who knows? And it wasn't anything dramatic such that I was thinking like, oh yeah, she's totally suicidal. [Pause.]
I guess part of the thing was I feel like I have no handle on when something is actually going to be to her like a huge angry upset disaster. Like sometimes I really do feel like at any point I can come home and she would sort of say like well, I've written up my will and you're [inaudible [00:20:01] again. 
We also had a huge argument about how actually I would be sad if she died and my primary concern would not be finding a new roommate. And she's like no; she's really like, we just had this very weird series of arguments about it. Like to her, her primary concern was, you know, that I'd be [inaudible [00:20:32], which is also pretty disturbing to me. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.]
CLIENT: So I do want to know what's going on, but I also don't want like sudden suicidal Ashby or sobbing on the kitchen floor, or any other thing where she would probably hit back with immediately is "Well, but I'm really messy." [Pause.] Because like when she's upset, she tends to use hit back fast. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I guess I... [Pause]...want me to solve the problem ideally like. Okay, so here's what you say. Somebody like this, you need to do, click your heels.
CLIENT: Yeah I know. It's like that. 
THERAPIST: And maybe partly because that's less anxious; it removes the whole thing away from your anxiety about how the hell she's doing. And what you're going to be confronted with. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I know what there's not a way to approach her that will work. 
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: Although, you know, in my head I would love it if you were like do this, right, and that would magically fix it. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I am worried about... [Pause]...because I'm starting to take leave on Friday. Friday is my last day at work. I don't know if this is the next thing that I'm worried about in part because I'm just going to be home more. And ... [pause]...and it's disruptive to my home life as well as I'm worried about...
THERAPIST: Sure. [Pause.] It's just as frustrating. Is there going to be a confrontation of one sort or another?
CLIENT: Yeah. The other thing is that like one of the things that Ashby does that drives me crazy that we also argue about is so then she'll ask me a question and then she'll proceed to answer it as if she was me, but not. She's like "Oh, how does this dress look?" "It looks fine." She's like, "No, you really hate it. You're thinking why is Ashby asking me all these questions?" I just said I like the dress. You know, and I really hate it when she starts telling me how I'm like, how I actually feel or like whatever it is she's doing. But she does that constantly, so I just kind of give up on that. [Pause.]
[00:24:56]
So I don't know. When I was on medical leave with fibroids, she, I think, was pretty resentful the paid time I had off. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It's also like my own fault or my own whatever, but she was always like saying, "Why aren't you back at work?" Like you know, I mean she's; yeah, she's sort of like, "Well when are you going back?" "Haven't you been out so long?" "You seem fine." And I was already being like, "yeah, I feel really bad." Like it sort of fed in to my own guilt about taking medical leave.
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: And then I would just be like that was crazy. Like it's weird that she said that and also that I listened. So I'm worried that she's going to do that again. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: I mean I'm just basically worried that this medical leave is going to be, while I won't be stressed being at work, I'll be stressed being at home. 
THERAPIST: And [Pause]...and by some types of interactions that are not so different curiously, or interactions that were, I think, in that pause]...I mean some are different, but it sounds like you worry that she won't really listen to you. She won't really be able to have a conversation with you that you know will be pushy and [inaudible 27:29], what can you do about it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like she has [inaudible 27:44] at work will be... [Pause.] 
CLIENT: And the other thing, like as with the manager at work, like he'll like it's really hard for me to get a straight answer. Like I do suspect she'd straight up lie to me about how she felt or was doing, weirdly because I'm mad at her and going to yell at her about it, which is not really what happens, but [pause]...I sort of like I'm thinking I want the leave to be easy and I mean, as easy as it can be. And to really have my main stress be physical therapy, it kind of sucking sometimes, whatever. And I'm worrying that, you know, it's like [inaudible 29:22] and my time being stressed out by Ashby acting weirdly, also being torn; wanting to talk to her about it, but not wanting to talk to her about it. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: It's hard to look at how anxious and upset dealing with this kind of stuff. I mean in a way, that's exactly what you've been doing for this hour, I suppose. But [inaudible [00:30:30] in terms of like the problem more so than...[pause]...I mean today like you're sort of framing it and describing it in ways that don't quite directly get at how you feel more or at how impossible it is. [Pause]. Which it well may be. I'm not at all disputing what you describe.
CLIENT: No, it's, yeah, I mean I have a lot of thoughts about doing it, but I don't know; if it was easier to talk, to think about how do I face this challenge as opposed to how do I feel about this. So she'd, and that like, [pause]...so in a way, it's basically like I already [inaudible 31:42] like we're both friends and roommates and they're kind of different relationships. And but also not...and so like I'm concerned about her dropping the ball on like being a good roommate where there's kind of no way, in talking about that, it's going to also be, "So I notice you've been acting kind of weird lately." And I feel like there's really never a good way to tell someone like, "I've noticed you've been acting really unpredictable way. How do you feel?" [inaudible 32:28] she's really in two people in not knowing how she feels. [Pause.] I think part of most of why I've been talking about why it's so difficult or impossible is that I've been thinking about like well how, what if I talked about this or well, you know, what is acceptable? What would be like fine? This is fine for like now or. I don't know; I get kind of thick and I end up running through my head different ways of talking to her could go. And none of them are great. 
[00:33:42]
I feel like when Ashby and I have arguments, like one of the things that ends up happening is it ends up like when we were talking Ashby, it's really gives us that sort of refocusing or reframing, so either I actually hate her or she's just a horrible disgusting loathsome person. I'm just confirming that she's horrible. And I don't want to do either. And nor is there a way to sort of...actually there's no way...it is not, it becomes not about whatever we were discussing about, like if we're talking about doing the dishes more. And it's like "Oh, I'd like for you to do the dishes more." "You hate me." And like it just...I don't know. I feel sometimes I just want to have a normal conversation about like doing the dishes and I feel as soon as our conversations get out of control really fast, we're sometimes in another conversation that you wouldn't want to have. And it's hard to get away. Like I feel the only way to get out of that conversation is to leave the room and shut the door. And I'm not even like always convinced that that would work. [Pause.]
[00:35:37]
I don't know, for me, I guess I feel it's impossible. I feel very...
THERAPIST: I think you're really intimidated.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And really anxious. 
CLIENT: Like I feel like I'm getting pushed in to a corner that I can't get out of. [Pause.] And I don't feel like we...I don't know. I think I've had so many; I'm trying to talk to her. I feel like she's like intimidating and pushing me and like doing whatever. And she's also insisting that I'm the guy who has all the control and I'm the one that is intimidating her. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Yeah, sort of gas lighting you.
CLIENT: Yeah, and also like...
THERAPIST: Which she applies vigorously. 
CLIENT: Yeah, it's just sort of no way out of that. I'm like oh okay. Like there's no [inaudible 36:59] or discussion or whatever we're trying to talk about. There would be....there's just no where to go. [Pause.] And then also sometimes she will use a sentence like, "And this is why I never talk to anyone about my feelings." Which again, you're blackmailing me emotionally, and that's not okay. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But that's part of why she used to blackmail me emotionally. [Pause.] 
[00:37:46]
THERAPIST: There's something going on that we were talking about that I'm trying to get my finger on and feel like I can't quite in the... [Pause]...you know to keep describing the things she does and the way they're impossible to deal with as though I'm not clear or you haven't explained it so far or I kind of really don't get the type. At least I feel like I do. And I feel like there's something going on there, but I'm not quite sure yet. [Pause.] I don't know. Maybe you feel kind of or maybe you have the unconscious idea that if I really understood what she was like, I would know what to tell you to do, or I would be able to explain how to make it better. [Pause.]
[00:39:26]
CLIENT: I mean yes, but I don't think that's all of it. I really would like someone to just say this is the thing to do. [Pause.] I don't know. It's just like I don't know how else to talk about it. Like...
THERAPIST: Oh yeah, well here's another possibility. I wonder if this is a way of [pause]...keeping me out of how incredibly scared and frustrated you feel about what's going on with her. [Pause.] That pause]...I don't know like, there's something about focusing on the sort of reality of what she's like, the impossibility, and trying to sort of again and again like get me to see that. That's kind of like has some affect on me that, not just having but then also is going to keep me kind of looking over there at Ashby and at how she is and what it's like to deal with her rather than at you. And what this is doing to you. [Pause.]
[00:41:27]
CLIENT: I do think that. I think that could be somewhat. I don't know. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I think we'll stop. And we'll not meet tomorrow, but I think I'll see you on Monday. Can you send me an e-mail about scheduling?
CLIENT: Yeah, so I actually have an e-mail when I last called, I wasn't able to make any of the appointments.
THERAPIST: Oh okay. 
CLIENT: Couldn't make any of the appointments, so, but right now, it's actually fine. 
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: It's kind of like therapy, then PT. 
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: One after each other. 
THERAPIST: Okay. 
CLIENT: But yeah, if the [inaudible 42:18] opens up, I'll let you know.
THERAPIST: Okay.
