<b>Abstract:</b> The author introduces the concepts of mind-body medicine, evidence-based medicine,
clinical psychophysiology and biofeedback, integrated care, and integrative medicine. The chapter
emphasizes a mind-body approach that recognizes the unitary psychophysiological nature of both
illness and healing. Many common medical problems are functional or chronic disorders exacerbated
by lifestyle, situational stress, and psychosocial factors. Managing or reducing the symptoms of such
disorders requires patients to make behavioral changes. Mind-body medicine offers patients an active
role in recovery and health maintenance. Scientific research offers a guiding "evidence-based" light
in designing the optimal mind-body treatment plan. Together, biofeedback and clinical
psychophysiology offer powerful tools for mind-body medicine. The mastery of self-regulation skills
is a primary tool for health. Today's health problems require an integrated care model, involving a
partnership of physician, nurse, psychologist, and other behavioral health professionals. This
partnership delivers behavioral interventions directly into primary care settings, integrates
complementary and conventional therapies, and modifies treatment paradigms to benefit larger
numbers of patients in primary care settings.

<b>Mind-Body Medicine</b>

Mind/body medicine ... should be an integral
part of evidence-based, cost-effective,
quality health care. (Sobel, 2000, p. 1705)


Mind-body medicine is a revolutionary
21st-century approach to health care that
includes a wide range of behavioral and
lifestyle interventions on an equal basis with
traditional medical interventions. The patient
in mind-body medicine is understood as
a totality of body, mind, and spirit. Interventions
are directed at each of these aspects
of the person. The medical conditions, linked
with human suffering today, in the affluent

The acute care medical model has provided
tremendous advances in the health
of human beings. Based on a dualistic
dichotomy of body and mind, the acute care
model is a mechanistic approach to disease
and treatment. The model emphasizes the use
of a diagnostic symptom-oriented interview,
extensive laboratory work, and sophisticated
imaging studies to identify a specific disease
or condition causing the patient's complaints
(Cassell, 1997). The corresponding treatment
model places a heavy reliance on pharmacology
and a lesser emphasis on surgical
intervention. Although most physicians
acknowledge the importance of life stress,
diet, and exercise, these factors are largely
addressed only after conventional therapeutic
strategies have failed. Psychological specialists
are regarded as secondary and
tertiary caregivers to be consulted when the
primary care physician has been unable to
provide relief or when no physical cause can
be identified for a disorder. In many cases, a
referral takes place only after the patient's
condition has become more severe and
chronic and thus less amenable to behavioral
intervention.


The education that physicians receive in
medical schools often does not prepare them
well for the typical patient in primary care
(see Chapters 6, 32, and 33). Patients are
more likely to present with symptoms that
fall into several overlapping categories:
somatization disorder, "undifferentiated
complaints," psychophysiological disorders
related to psychosocial stress, posttraumatic
conditions, somatic symptoms of psychiatric
disorders, and symptoms of chronic disease.
The mismatch between the health needs
of the typical patient and the standard
medical response produces a waste of
medical resources, frustration for patient
and physician, and the danger that acute
conditions become chronic.


Mind-body medicine includes behavioral
and psychosocial interventions among the first
line of interventions. The patient is given an
active role from the beginning in developing a
treatment plan and takes more responsibility
for directing the psychosocial and lifestyle
aspects of that plan. Mind-body medicine
emphasizes patient education and patient self-management
as integral parts of clinical practice,
from the first day of well care (Blonshine,
1998; Kotses et al., 1995; Nakagawa-Kogan,
1994). Smoking cessation is one example of a
critical area for patient education, addressing
the number one risk factor that is currently
manageable, with dramatic consequences
for morbidity and mortality. One in five
Americans dies as a result of complications
related to smoking (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 1994). For many
patient groups, research has shown that relatively
brief and inexpensive mind-body interventions
can improve the patient's recovery
process, speed healing, shorten inpatient stays,
and reduce the cost of treatment (Blanchard
et al., 1985; Sobel, 2000).

<b>Challenging Problems in Primary Care</b>

This section highlights some of the most
challenging patient groups in primary care.

[p. <i>5</i>]

<b><i>Somatization Disorder</i></b>


Somatization disorder involves the translation
of emotional distress into physical
symptoms, when no significant organic bases
have been identified for the complaints. A
patient's tendency to develop physical symptoms
often begins at an early age and continues
ues for many years, even decades (Quill,
1985). Physicians may contribute to the genesis
of somatization disorder by failing to
detect signs of the somatization process and
aggressively pursuing diagnostic testing (e.g.,
X rays, CT scans, blood tests), which confirms
the patient's preconception that some
serious disease is lurking undetected (Groth-Marnat
&amp; Edkins, 1996).


<b><i>Undifferentiated Complaints</i></b>


Michael Balint (1964) pointed out that
many patients in primary care present
"undifferentiated complaints" (see also,
E. Balint &amp; Norell, 1973). Undifferentiated
complaints are vague presentations of symptoms
that have not yet developed into clear-cut
cut physical or medical illnesses. Kroenke
and Mangelsdorff (1989) observed that only
20 percent of visits to primary care physicians
involve discoverable organic causes,
and only 10 percent are clearly psychological
disorders without confounding physical
symptoms. The complaints most commonly
presented in the family practitioner's office
today include chest pain, fatigue, dizziness,
headache, edema, back pain, dyspnea,
insomnia, abdominal pain, numbness, impotence,
weight loss, cough, and constipation
(Blount, 1998, p. 6). The first 10 complaints
in this list account for 40 percent of all visits.
For patients with these complaints, only
10 percent to 15 percent were determined,
after one year, to have clear organic diagnoses
(Blount, 1998, pp. 6-7).


According to Balint (1964), the majority
of primary care patients' complaints lie in a
twilight zone between body and mind,
marked by overlapping psychosocial stress,
physical discomfort, relationship conflicts,
life-stage dissatisfaction, and unfulfilled aspirations.
The response of the physician is critical
because unless the patient is assisted to
identify psychosocial aspects of his or her
distress, the patient will continue to shape his
or her complaints in the direction of an
established somatic disorder. There is a significant
risk with such patients of a harmful
"over-medicalisation" (Smith, 1995). Balint
suggested using the doctor-patient relationship
as a tool to enable patients to become
aware of the nonmedical aspects of their
distress and thus avoid the somatization
process. (Chapter 2 describes the high risk
model of threat perception, which provides
guidance for steering in this twilight zone by
identifying specific psychosocial factors that
increase the risk for somatic symptoms, serve
as triggers for symptoms, or create a buffer
against symptoms.)


<b><i>Psychophysiological Disorders</i></b>


Many of the undifferentiated complaints
¡ust mentioned also qualify as psychophysiological
disorders. They involve measurable
modifications in physiology but worsen
under the influence of situational stress or
internal cognitive distress (Gatchel &amp;
Blanchard, 1993). Sternbach's (1966) stressdiathesis
model states that each human
being shows a certain response stereotypy,
responding physiologically to situations in a
particular way. Some individuals are cardiovascular
responders, some musculoskeletal,
some gastrointestinal, and home cognitive.
Then, if the individual's coping resources do
not keep his or her physiology within

[p. <i>6</i>]

<b><i>Posttraumatic Conditions</i></b>


Many patients who present in primary care
settings suffer delayed consequences of physical
and sexual abuse, traumatic experiences,
and losses. A prospective study of 1,007 members
of a Michigan HMO reported that a
history of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) was associated with significantly more
somatic symptoms in general and with an
increased incidence of somatization symptoms
(Andreski, Chilcoat, &amp; Breslau, 1998). In
many cases, neither the patient nor the physician
recognizes the connection between current
symptoms and earlier emotional trauma.
Research by van der Kolk et al. (1996)
showed that PTSD, dissociation, and somatization
are highly interrelated. Individuals with
childhood trauma show the greatest vulnerability
to somatization, although individuals
with adult trauma or loss also show heightened
incidence of somatization. Lingering
"unconscious trauma" involves measurable
physiological arousal patterns. As Wickramasekera
(1988, 1998) observed, individuals can
push trauma out of their minds but not out of
their bodies. Biofeedback and clinical psychophysiology
provide useful tools in this context,
monitoring autonomic nervous arousal
through such modalities as heart rate, skin
conductance, and peripheral temperature and
detecting traumatic memories in the course of
assessment (see Chapters 2 and 8).


<b><i>Somatic Symptoms
of Psychiatric Disorders</i></b>


Unrecognized psychiatric disorders
account for a large portion of the complaints
in primary care. Patients with anxiety and
depressive disorders present physical symptoms
in both primary care and specialty clinics.
An estimated 65 percent of individuals
with anxiety-related disorders seek treatment
from primary care physicians (Danton,
Altrocchi, Antonuccio, &amp; Basta, 1994). A
study of patients with acute chest pain
showed that 17.5 percent had panic disorder
and 23.1 percent had depression (Yingling,
Wulsin, Arnold, &amp; Rouan, 1993). Patients
with panic disorder or depression were much
more likely to have made an emergency room
visit in the preceding 12 months than were
the patients without psychiatric conditions.


In a study of 1,000 primary care patients,
deGruy (1994) examined the relationship
between the occurrence of 15 common physical
symptoms and the presence of psychiatric
disorders. The more physical symptoms
were present, the higher the likelihood of
a psychiatric disorder. The relationship
between physical symptoms and mood problems
is reciprocal. Anxious and depressed
individuals are more vulnerable to developing
functional symptoms, and persons who
suffer a variety of medical complaints are
more vulnerable to the onset of depression
and anxiety (deGruy, 1996). Kroenke (2000)
argues for an equal emphasis on the identification
of anxiety, depression, and somatization
disorders and highlights the commonalities
of the three disorders.


Depressed individuals seek help most
often in primary care settings; yet they are
often neither well diagnosed nor well managed
in primary care. Rost et al. (1998)
identified 98 adults with current major
depression. Thirty-two percent of these primary
care patients remained undetected for
up to one year. Simply identifying patients

[p. <i>7</i>]

<b><i>Chronic Conditions</i></b>


Patients with chronic illness account for
between 46 percent and 75 percent of costs
in health care. This includes such diverse
conditions as diabetes mellitus, arthritis,
hypertension, and chronic heart disease.
Lifestyle, diet, exercise, habits such as smoking,
and situational stress play a major part
in both the etiology and course of such conditions.
Medical management via medication
is a losing battle unless the behavioral factors
are addressed. Once a chronic condition progresses
to a more advanced stage, treatment
is palliative and not curative, and both
patient and physician are forced to modify
expectations. On the other hand, targeted
behavioral services can reduce needless suffering
and successfully reduce medical costs
by 18 percent to 31 percent for individuals
with such chronic conditions as diabetes and
hypertension (Lechnyr, 1992).


When the patient's condition is chronic or
complex and involves chronic irreversible
changes in anatomy and physiology, the
acute care model clearly reaches its limits. In
frustration, physicians typically add medication
after medication to manage the ever
multiplying list of complaints. The use of
polypharmacy then produces an array of
interactive adverse effects, typically including
fatigue, lethargy, weight gain, inactivity,
and loss of any sense of internal control
over body and health. The individual with a
chronic condition eventually comes to see
him- or herself in a passive patient role, submitting
to tests and procedures, and awaiting
the physician's next decision or intervention.
The patient's lifestyle frequently becomes
organized around a never ending series of
medical visits, lab tests, and medications.
The secondary effects of the more sedentary
lifestyle are interactive with the original disease
or condition, producing a loss of muscle tone,
aerobic conditioning, and general vitality.
Treatment compliance becomes a major issue
for the physician because the patient often
shows little "ownership" in the medical care
plan. The individual often struggles with
whether to accept a diagnosis and cooperate
with prescribed medication or resist the
diagnosis and the prescribed treatment.


In many chronic conditions, personal
choices and lifestyle play a role in initiating
and maintaining the illness (McLellan, Lewis,
O'Brien, &amp; Kleber, 2000). These psychological
factors interact with genetics and
familial/cultural factors in the onset of the
disorder. The decision to drink the first drink
and the habit of regular excessive drinking
interact with the genetic vulnerability to alcohol
dependence to create the chronic illness of
alcoholism and the eventual end-state condition
of liver disease. Similarly, salt sensitivity
is an inherited risk factor for hypertension,
yet individual dietary choices and familial salt
use patterns influence which individuals end
up with hypertension. Voluntary, lifestyle,
and familial variables also contribute to creating
some of the strongest health risk factors,
including obesity, stress level, and inactivity,
which exacerbate many chronic conditions
(McLellan et al., 2000).

<b>Evidence-Based Medicine</b>

Evidence-based medicine is a systematic
effort to bring science and research-based
knowledge into the heart of clinical
practice. (Sackett, Straus, Richardson,
Rosenberg, &amp; Haynes, 2000)


The clinical judgment ot health care
providers is easily distorted by coincidental
improvements in a handful of patients
(Jonas, Linde, &amp; Walach, 1999). Research
tests the efficacy of treatments for a specific

[p. <i>8</i>]

Jonas, Linde, and Walach (1999, p. 73)
asserted that six kinds of knowledge should
ideally be considered in the course of reaching
evidence-based treatment decisions:

1. Patient preferences and meaning.

2. Mechanisms of action.


3. Safety and efficacy.


4. Treatment effect probabilities in the open
clinical setting from observational and outcomes
research.

Under typical conditions, fortunately, the
same authors concede that it is sufficient to
weigh "clinical expertise, patient relevance,
and research evidence," providing a three-legged
foundation for evidence-based practice
(p. 74).


Under evidence-based medicine, assessing
a patient's condition and selecting treatment
are collaborative processes in which
physician and patient make decisions together
based on up-to-date knowledge about the
relative efficacy and risks of available treatment
options. Following evidence-based
medicine means that not all new patients will
be given the same treatment interventions
regardless of their complaints. The provider's
preference for a specific modality does not
justify the use of that modality if current outcome
research shows that another modality
has a clear advantage in effectiveness, cost,
or reduced risk to the patient (Dams, 1997).


If the patient presents with a panic disorder,
for example, there is strong outcome
data showing the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral
therapy, alone or combined with medication
(Barlow, Gorman, Shear, &amp; Woods,
2000). There is also an increasingly strong
body of literature showing the presence of
hyperventilation and other dysfunctional
breathing patterns in panic disorder (Wilhelm
&amp; Roth, 1998) and the effectiveness of
biofeedback training in diaphragmatic
breathing to moderate both abnormal breathing
and panic. No such research supports the
use of intensive psychoanalytic therapy for
panic disorder. Therefore, the provider would
violate the patient's right to an effective,
inexpensive, and nonharmful treatment were
he or she to follow personal preference and
deliver psychoanalytic therapy.


On the physical medicine side, it is clear
that a patient should not be steered into cardiac
bypass surgery, risking life, inflicting
pain, and requiring weeks of healing and
rehabilitation, if outcome data show that
patients with similar angiograms do equally
well on medication. In mind-body medicine,
the evidence-based principle means that
providers should consider which modalities
and treatment strategies hold up best in
research, which are available in the locale,
and which are available given the patient's
means and health insurance coverage. Then
the patient's response to each intervention
reopens the decision-making process.

[p. <i>9</i>]

Another challenge in evidence-based
medicine is paradigm shifting. When a condition
is medical, the most effective intervention
may nevertheless be behavioral. The
federal Health Care Finance Administration
recently recognized that biofeedback should
be the first line of treatment for urinary
incontinence (Perry, 2000). Biofeedback uses
electromyographic sensors to monitor pelvic
floor muscle activity, and the patient learns
better muscular control (see Chapter 22). Yet
medical caregivers still frequently think in
terms of medication or corrective surgery for
this disorder.


Similarly, the outcome research on irritable
bowel syndrome shows that cognitive
behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and biofeedback
are all effective, noninvasive, and costeffective
(Blanchard, 2001); medication
remains more widely used yet is less effective
(see Chapter 21). Choosing within behavioral
approaches should be guided by
research and access. The outcome research is
strongest on hypnosis and cognitive-behavioral
therapy, so one would lean toward
choosing these modalities. However, the
unavailability of a qualified hypnotherapist
or cognitive-behavioral therapist and the
availability of a qualified biofeedback practitioner
might steer the decision differently.
Similarly, cultural factors play a role in the
selection of a treatment--for example, if the
patient has a religious bias against hypnotism
that cannot be dispelled by a brief education
about medical hypnotism.


Evidence-based practice recognizes the
powerful role of faith and placebo in the
healing process. Nonspecific factors play a
major role in the patient's response to treatment.
The use of interventions widely
regarded as efficacious increases the patient's
faith (Ader &amp; Cohen, 1993; Wickramasekera,
1999). Similarly, complementary and alternative
therapies that have the cachet of something
new and powerful are useful in eliciting
this nonspecific healing effect. Trousseau's
old comment is apt, that one "should treat as
many patients as possible with the new drugs
while they still have the power to heal"
(Trousseau, 1854, cited by Wickramasekera,
1999, p. la). Current research on the placebo
as a form of conditioning improves one's
ability to use this nonspecific effect while
continuing to practice within the framework
of evidence-based practice (Ader, 1988).


Finally, evidence-based medicine has to
adapt the relatively black-and-white guidelines
of outcome research to the realities of a
given individual. Outcome research is largely
based on homogeneous samples of patients
with a given disorder, and many individuals
are excluded from such studies due to comorbid
conditions, the use of confounding medications,
or the chronicity of their conditions.
In the world of clinical practice, one is faced
with individuals who have complex, chronic
conditions and multiple comorbid problems
and are already using a variety of medications
and other therapies. The science of
evidence-based medicine must serve the art
of clinical practice. The health care provider
weighs each of the individual's medical and
psychological conditions when selecting and
delivering a new treatment intervention.

<b>Biofeedback and Clinical Psychophysiology</b>

Biofeedback is an evidence-based treatment
paradigm that opens up a broad avenue for
the mind-body approach (Moss, 1998;
Schwartz &amp; Associates, 1995). The biofeedback
instrument measures a biological
process such as muscle tension by means of a
sensor and provides an immediate visual or
auditory display of this signal to the subject
(Lawlis, 2001). The feedback of the biological
signal increases the individual's awareness
of his or her own body and enables
the individual to establish control over the
physiological system (see Figure 1.1).

[p. <i>10</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284025-I003&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The modality of biofeedback supports a
philosophy of self-regulation and the acquisition
of voluntary controls over one's own
body and life. The individual gains self-efficacy
by learning control over a muscle,
brain wave, or other physiological process,
by reducing the severity of symptoms, and by
increasing a sense of participation in personal
wellness. Self-efficacy, the inner conviction
that one can do something that will
make a positive difference, often generalizes
into a more active personal mastery over psychosocial
and relationship problems.


Chapter 8 by Gilbert and Moss summarizes
the procedures and applications of
biofeedback, and several chapters in this book
highlight the applications of biofeedback to
common medical and emotional disorders.
Biofeedback has proven effective in controlling
many physiological processes--including
muscle tension, skin temperature, respiration,
autonomic nervous tension, heart rate, electrical
wave activity in the brain, and brain blood
flow--and has applications in health care,
mental health, rehabilitation, education,
sports psychology, and the performing arts.
Within primary care, a broad range of
biofeedback applications have been documented,
from headache to asthma, hypertension,
and chronic pain (see Chapter 8). There
are also well-documented applications to
mental health problems, including anxiety,
depression, attention deficit disorders, alcoholism
and addictions, and general psychotherapy
(Moss, 2001, 2002).


Biofeedback is a useful tool for helping
individuals understand the mind-body link.
The biofeedback display shows the patient
vividly how memories or thoughts induce an
immediate physiological change. Biofeedback
practice rests on the psychophysiological
principle that mind and body are so delicately
interwoven that any change in the bodily
state will evoke a psychological change and
any change in the mind will evoke a physiological
change (Green, Green, &amp; Walters,
1970, p. 3). Biofeedback quickly teaches
heightened body awareness, as the instrument
detects the individual's subtle physiological
reactions and the individual learns to consciously
feel what had been automatic and
below awareness. Biofeedback speeds the
acquisition of relaxation skills. It also serves
as a Trojan horse, accepting the patient's
somatic orientation, gaining the patient's
trust for a seemingly medical and physiological
approach, and leading the patient to
an understanding of mind-body linkages
(see Chapter 2; Wickramasekera. 1988;
Wickramasekera, Davies, &amp; Davies, 1996).

[p. <i>11</i>]

Biofeedback is not practiced in isolation
but is part of a comprehensive mind-body
approach called clinical psychophysiology.
Clinical psychophysiology uses current
knowledge of behavior-change skills and an
understanding of physiologic functioning to
produce simultaneous changes in mind and
body. Practitioners typically design a customized
behavioral treatment package for
each patient, which may include any or all of
the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Education about physiology relevant to the
presenting symptoms
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Relaxation skills training, including progressive
muscle relaxation, autogenic training,
and diaphragmatic breathing
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Stress management to buffer the family
or job problems exacerbating physical
symptoms
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Cognitive restructuring to modify thought
patterns that maintain physical tensions
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Behavior therapy to reduce maladaptive or
self-defeating behavior
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Physiological monitoring during psychotherapy,
utilizing autonomic nervous system
arousal to identify implicit emotional issues
(Wickramasekera, 1988, 1998).

Biofeedback and clinical psychophysiology
provide a model for mind-body medicine
because they form a three-decade-old mindbody
approach founded on scientific research
and dedicated to enlarging the individual's
control over body and mind.

<b>Integrated Care</b>

The patient of the future will encounter an
integrated system of behavioral and medical
care, involving a partnership of behavioral
practitioners, physicians and nurses, in "one
house" and "one system." (Cummings &amp;
Cummings, 2000)


The ideal of integrated care requires that
the full range of mind-body interventions be
included from the first day of any patient's
health care and remain a part of each successive
episode of treatment (Nadeau &amp; Moss,
1999). This means that simple and inexpensive
counseling on lifestyle changes and the
use of nutritional and habit-changing procedures
are made available to each patient at
each visit, wherever they may serve to prevent
the onset of illness or alleviate current
symptoms. Similarly, every patient entering
surgery should receive at least a brief educational
session with an office nurse, a written
handout depicting the surgical procedure and
its impact on the body, and an audiotape on
relaxation skills, including visualization and
hypnotic-type suggestions of rapid healing.
Research has shown that such presurgical
education can reduce blood loss, speed
wound healing, and reduce days admitted
(Dreher, 1998; Kiecolt-Glaser, Page, Marucha,
MacCallum, &amp; Glaser, 1998).


For over four decades, authors in behavioral
medicine and psychosomatic medicine
have criticized the Cartesian mind-body split
in medical thinking. In 1977, George Engel
proposed a unitary biopsychosocial model
for all of medicine. Most medical researchers
today agree that clinical disorders are better
understood from a unitary and integrative
mind-body perspective. However, the physical
organization of medical practice, including
the sharp division between physical
medicine and the mental health specialties,
has continued the mind-body split in an
equally destructive fashion. Physical medicine
specialists throw up then Hands and
declare, "This problem belongs in psychiatry."
The patient arrives in the psychiatric
specialty clinic hurt, bitter, and discouraged,
declaring that "My doctor thinks my
problem isn't real" or "My doctor says the

[p. <i>12</i>]

When physicians and behavioral specialists
attempt to create truly integrated care,
many obstacles intervene. There are significant
differences in education and professional
culture between physicians and behavioral
specialists (Haley et al., 1998). Practitioners
in each group think, behave, and approach
problems differently in their daily clinical
practice. As a result, medical institutions frequently
exclude or limit the scope of practice
of psychologists and other behavioral professionals.
Sample differences in professional
culture include (1) physicians are more
authoritarian in interpersonal style, operate
on a faster pace, and arrive at decisions
rapidly by objective criteria; and (2) psychologists
tend to be more egalitarian and team
oriented in interpersonal style, gather information
over a longer period, and often rely
on intuition and global impressions as much
as objective criteria (Haley et al., 1998).


The organization of reimbursement also
creates numerous barriers to integrated care.
Behavioral practitioners are frequently
informed that they cannot be reimbursed for
the treatment of physical disorders, such as
gastric ulcers, diabetes, or even pain disorders.
They must identify psychiatric diagnoses if
they wish to be reimbursed. Similarly, many
insurance companies only reimburse bills for
certain diagnoses, such as chronic pain, when
the services are billed on a hospital billing
form that outpatient mental health providers
cannot use.


Finally, many managed care companies
use a "mental health carve-out." The treatment
of all psychiatric diagnoses falls under
a separately managed and capitated budget.
The effectiveness of the gatekeeper is judged
solely on the funds within this mental health
carve-out. Thus authorizing psychotherapeutic
or behavioral services for a patient with
multiple somatic complaints may save money
by reduced use of medical services, but the
mental health gatekeeper receives no
recognition for these cost savings because
they are not credited to his or her budget.


One positive step addresses some of these
reimbursement barriers: Foxhall (2000)
reports that the American Medical Association
committee on Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes has approved six new codes
covering psychosocial and behavioral services
for patients with physical health diagnoses.
This includes two codes for health and behavior
assessment and four codes for health and
behavior intervention services.

<b>Integrative Medicine: The Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies</b>

Ina primary care setting, <i>integrated care</i> means
that behavioral health providers are present
to offer psychosocial, educational, and psychophysiological
interventions as part of the
primary treatment of patient distress. Inclusion
of behavioral health providers is an implementation
of what research has long supported.
Many typical patient complaints have more to
do with the patient's psychosocial problems
than with diagnosable diseases, infections,
injuries, or pathophysiological processes.


Integrative medicine takes this model one
step farther, making the entire range of complementary
and alternative medicine (CAM)
interventions available within the primary
care clinic. Today CAM interventions range
from acupuncture to nutritional therapies to
Eastern disciplines such as yoga, prayer, and
spiritual healing (see Box 1.1). Biofeedback,
herbal supplements, acupuncture, and chiropractic
therapies lie at the more widely
accepted end of the spectrum for health care
providers, because a significant number of
research studies and case reports show their
efficacy. Research today is accumulating
showing the effectiveness of many other CAM
interventions (Ernst et al., 2001; Joñas &amp;
Levin, 1999). The general public in the United
States already shows a readiness to accept and

The majority of patients today want health
care that has some or all of these elements.
Patients want their health care provider to
know them as human beings, not just as
cases, and they resent a lack of such personalism
in medicine. They want holism as well.
They don't want to be referred to a psychiatrist
with the implication that their problem is
"in their heads," yet they want their physician
to pay attention to and care about their life
problems. Harold Koenig has remarked,
"Patients want to be seen and treated as a
whole person, not as diseases. A whole person
is someone whose being has physical,
emotional, and spiritual dimensions. Ignoring
any of these aspects of humanity leaves the
person incomplete and may even interfere
with healing" (Koenig, 2000, p. 1708).


The public is sometimes drawn to CAM
therapies for the same reasons that arouse the
objections of health care professionals
(Beyerstein, 2001, p. 230). The origin of many
CAM procedures in premodern religions and

[p. <i>14</i>]

The integration of CAM therapies in
mainline medical clinics may seem to strain
the bounds of clinical medicine too far. Yet
outcome research is accumulating showing
positive efficacy for a number of CAM therapies
for specific disorders (Jonas, 2001;
Jonas &amp; Levin, 1999). If a tai chi class will
reduce the number of falls and hip fractures
in elderly individuals, for example, then why
shouldn't that class be offered within the
internal medicine clinic (Wolf et al., 1996)?
The physician-patient relationship is a
powerful motivational tool to increase patient
compliance with such CAM practices.


Current research tells us that patients are
already using CAM therapies in enormous
numbers and that 60 percent of these patients
are not telling their primary care physicians
about their use of CAM (Eisenberg et al.,
1998). Consequently, the patient's health care
is fragmented, and the possibility for adverse
interactions among CAM therapies and conventional
therapies is increased. Wayne Jonas,
who headed the federal Office of Alternative
Medicine, advocates that health care providers
become cognizant of CAM and use the available
online databases to identify CAM therapies
for which clinical efficacy has been
documented.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_42587');">[note]</a><div id="_note_42587" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">2. Jonas cites the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine database, with over 100,000 citations, available at
http://www.nccam.nih.gov/databases.html, and the <i>British Medical journal</i>'s book
<i>Clinical Evidence</i>, available at http://www.clinicalevidence.com.</div>
He emphasizes a four-step
process, the "Four Ps," in which the physician
(1) <i>protects</i> the patient from potentially harmful
CAM remedies; (2) <i>permits</i> the patient to
use any harmless and inexpensive remedy,
even when efficacy has not been established,
in hopes that nonspecific placebo effects will
be mobilized; (3) <i>promotes</i> proven CAM
practices--that is, encourages any safe and
proven CAM therapies; and (4) <i>partners</i> with
any outside CAM therapists that patients are
using (Jonas, 2001). These guidelines open the
door to a medicine that is once again whole.
