COUNSELOR: Client 051. This is client 0518-014, 0518-0145. Session number 15. Session number 15. March 4, 1971. March 4, 1971. Session number 15.
You have new boots. 
PATIENT: I actually really don't, I got them at the beginning of the year but they were too fancy for me to wear. The heel was too high. But my other ones just the insides are falling apart so I put them on. Makes me feel very (inaudible at 0:01:04.9) today. Makes me like cross my legs and act like a lady. 
COUNSELOR: Oh really. (chuckles) They are very fancy especially with that dress. I can see why you have to be a lady. 
PATIENT: It's kinda nice. And it's a pretty day too. And my hair is clean. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.
PATIENT: So it's nice. Oh the funniest thing I've ever, I had an appointment with the Dean. Apparently he like sent me a letter a long time (inaudible at 0:01:29.6) because I'm academic probation. Because I have billions of incompletes. And I never, I just, you know my usual way of dealing with it was to completely forget about it and avoid it. I knew had to, I never even did it. 
COUNSELOR: Right. 
PATIENT: All of a sudden I just got struck that I had to do it. And I made an appointment with the wrong Dean. I went to the wrong Dean yesterday. And he said, "I don't think it's me you want to see." Because there's this letter in your folder that Dean Vice (sp?) wants to see you. So I made an appointment with him today to talk to him. And I was really honest with him. And I liked him more than I thought I would He was like a pretty personable guy. He was, he was very, without like having talked to him more than a couple of minutes he like was telling me I should go see a therapist. (laughs) 0:02:10.8
COUNSELOR: (laughs) Did you tell him you already were? 
PATIENT: No, I didn't. I just like sat back and watched him advise me to go to the health center. And then he said you know I think you should have somebody outside you know your parents or your friends help you decide what to do or something. He was like, oh man, he was convinced that my last, my incompletes was pathological and stuff. And it probably is right. But he didn't talk to me more than a minute. I certainly didn't say anything very revealing. (chuckles) It was very funny. And then, not only that though. And so we had this like semi real talk.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And where I told that I did have trouble doing it afterwards so. But he like, I couldn't believe he just right off was sending me to..
COUNSELOR: There's something sort of bazaar about that. 
PATIENT: Well I kind of, I kind of resented that he was that I, because I don't think I appear crazy. And I don't think that I am very much. And certainly I didn't think at the first glance he would be telling me, but it was kinda amusing but it was really funny. Because I was like telling him I didn't have trouble, I did incompletes and stuff. And so then I left my books in his office. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Oh no. 
PATIENT: I just had to go back and get them and luckily he was already out to lunch but. He told his secretary and I met her as she was walking down the hall to leave. But anyway. It makes me feel a little bit weird. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, like what is it that you can see at first glance? 0:04:01.0
PATIENT: And then you know I'm sitting there the whole time, some of me feeling like he's really giving me good advice. The other part of me resenting that he was trying to be personal when he doesn't even know me.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And.
COUNSELOR: Like what the hell is this phony real talk bit? 
PATIENT: Kinda yeah. And he probably you know, the other thing is he seemed to really like be very proud of himself for thinking of all these things, right. He'd like give me all these reasons why I shouldn't really talk to friends or teachers or parents because they all have vested interest. Like my parents would either want me to stay so that it's easier for them to stay or leave so they can act out their fantasies through me. And he was like going into these like detailed psychological explanations and he didn't know what he was talking about. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He was like very you know. And that bothered me.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But then it really like creeped me when I left my books there. Because I'm feeling obviously like responded in some way by being I don't know. It was..
COUNSELOR: Sort of like yes I do need help, see? Like that? 
PATIENT: Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. I don't know what it means but that was what I was afraid it meant.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Um hmm.
PATIENT: I've started worrying about whether or not doing my work was, knew what was behind that. Because I really like can't seem to get it done. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm. If not doing your work was behind what?
PATIENT: No, what was behind not doing my work. 
COUNSELOR: Oh I see. Right. 
PATIENT: Like you know. I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah like what is it that you can't do it? 0:05:55.8
PATIENT: Because really it's just like very difficult to really sit down and do it.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I don't know. I want to decide now whether I'm going to stay in school or leave school.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. I'm not sure. You mean you want to make up your mind one way or another because you want to know? 
PATIENT: Yeah because there are all these things. Like if I'm going to stay then maybe I should find another place to live. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I see. Like you need to know now. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah and also that it's just very, I mean I have this feeling like I, I know that I'm not going to leave until I finish my work.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because I can't. I don't want to get kicked out of this place in bad standing. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: That would just really be no good for my head. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Because I would just like cement all this that ties them together. (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Really like I'd never be able to tie them off. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. I see what you mean. 
PATIENT: But I don't, I don't know. How are you? 
COUNSELOR: That sounds like it's such a mess in your head that you know the only thing that (inaudible at 0:07:53.5)
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: I'm all right. 0:07:57.7
PATIENT: I don't know anything about you hardly. And you're about to not be my therapist anymore so.
COUNSELOR: Hmm. Yeah there's a lot of stuff in there like if you're feeling untogether now, will you be even more untogether besides like have you spent all this time with me without getting to know me and without, I don't know. 
PATIENT: I guess I have this weird feeling like it would just be strange. Especially since I might be here. You know I really decided that I'm not going to leave without having at least cleaning out what's already a mess. If not making some more. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I don't know if I'll register for springtime but I'll be here for summer. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And I don't know it'd just be really strange like if all of a sudden I wouldn't see Rene any more. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. And that's a peculiar way to have a relationship. You know someone and then all of a sudden it's just cut off. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Because no other relationship is like that. Like if you like somebody or if you care about them then you keep in touch. 0:10:16.8
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You know and if you don't it just seems, I don't know. Keeps on bringing me back to the therapy relation is really different than any other. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And sometimes I really like it and sometimes I don't. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's sort of like built in desertion or something.
PATIENT: Yeah. Do you like that?
COUNSELOR: No I don't think I do. You mean do I like that it's time limited? 
PATIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: No, I don't think so. Are you thinking something like, "Well if you don't like it?" 0:12:10.4
PATIENT: What? 
COUNSELOR: Is something going through your head like, "Well if you don't like it and I don't like it?"
PATIENT: That wasn't what was going through my head but it certainly could be. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: It wasn't that moment. But it certainly is there. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm scared to think it right. Because then I'll have to ask you. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: And then if I ask you then I'll have to hear the answer. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And you care the answer might hurt. 
PATIENT: It's nifty how I block access to questions. 
COUNSELOR: It's like you block access to questions? 
PATIENT: Right so I won't have to, because I know that I don't want to get anywhere near the answer. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. I see.
PATIENT: So I even block the fundamental stuff of thinking about the question lots of times. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: But I don't really block it because it's all sitting in there. I just don't verbalize it. And that has a lot to do with thinking about it. 
COUNSELOR: Sort of like you leave it in little piles or something instead of forming it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You leave all the materials spread out. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And that some of me wants to just like not particularly worry about it. And just like when the quarter runs out or I run all the sessions out or whatever then I'll just, then I'll just like won't see you. And like during the week those times I don't see you I don't think about it would be nice to see Rene. But I do sometimes. 0:14:13.0
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then lots of times there's that when you show up in the (Sea Shop) (ph) or something. That's when it sort of would be nice.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I don't know. No there's the only way that I would think about it. That's silly. But I don't know what to do with it right because I don't want to ask you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: What are you thinking about?
COUNSELOR: I was just, I was just trying to imagine like if you asked me and I said no. I was trying to imagine the kind of things that would do to you. Feeling so complicated like that. 
PATIENT: My insides just get really tight.0:15:58.3
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I don't know. I won't even let myself, I mean if I start to think about it I just get spaced. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: For protection, I mean I don't want to think about it, right? Because I really sense well if she can do that then she doesn't really care.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Or then I say well that's silly. You know that's what therapeutic relationships are. There's something very businesslike about them.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: There's also something, I don't know. Or like it seems like neither of these two opposite things. Like there's something very unbusinesslike. I'm just, like sometimes when I leave and the way you smile it's just like I really don't think of that as business. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: But there is something very businesslike about you too. Which I respect and don't respect at the same time. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: There's something else that even fights it and it's very like familiar about having a tennis racket and the pillow and old draperies and the tennis ball holding up a book and stuff. Like they're opposites. Like unfamiliar disorder. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm.
PATIENT: Which is unbusinesslike and more like (inaudible at 0:18:00.2)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know. There's (inaudible at 0:18:11.0)
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:18:23.8) [the next room?] (ph) 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Big space.
PATIENT: Yeah. What was it before (inaudible at 0:19:00.6)
COUNSELOR: Yep. Sure did. It's sort of like you turned the knob down to where the sounds stop being sharp sounds and they start being just sort of blurry noises. It puts me (inaudible at 0:19:48.3)
PATIENT: So, a little bit scares me. Well it's just like this slightest, you're this great person I think are this just the slightest nudge I can get. Very spaced and sad. 
COUNSELOR: That you're so close to where your space. It should take so little. But you're so close to being so..
PATIENT: It feel like every time you say it I realize that while I haven't been knowing you for the past bunch of, however long it's been since you said it to me last time that I'm (inaudible at 0:20:59.5). Also you say you're sad. I mean I never even think about it until all of a sudden you say you're sad and then it just like hits me. And just, and then I get this feeling like I'm fundamentally sad and spaced and anything else is like (inaudible at 0:21:28.2)
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 
PATIENT: Anything else is like just frosting or something. 
COUNSELOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Underneath that. 
COUNSELOR: Basically. 
PATIENT: Yeah, not basically forever.
COUNSELOR: But basically now. 
PATIENT: But basically the past bunch of times. 
COUNSELOR: Bunch of times with me?
PATIENT: Bunch of time. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: All quarter (inaudible at 0:21:56.0)
COUNSELOR: Let me check this with you because I had, I just a different set on why you were spaced than you were saying. Because you said like it was like fundamental. And I thought I saw it happen. 
PATIENT: Fundamental? 
COUNSELOR: Yes. Basic you were basically sad and spaced. And that any time you got to where you really were that you would come up sad and spaced. 
PATIENT: But you saw it happen? 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: (inaudible 0:22:35.0)
COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. What I thought was that like you, you spaced down the thing of our finishing. 
PATIENT: Yeah that's when I did go away. 
COUNSELOR: Huh?
PATIENT: That's when I did go away. I'm going to do it right. I don't think I really let myself know how deeply I feel about you. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because really like when you first said something, I can't remember what it was. It was just a couple of minutes ago. I said oh yeah. You said, I wonder what you would, how it would affect you or something if I had said no.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: But you said no.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And my stomach got really tight and since I just I can't even think about it. Like there's just too getting spaced.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Like there's going, an intense feeling that just starts. It's too intense to get into. 0:24:06.3
PATIENT: I guess I feel like space is like this protective covering. A protective fog. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Would it help to be able to deal with stuff like that? My feeling is that I don't even want to learn how to deal with people saying no. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah, but.. You don't want people saying no to be in your world. 
PATIENT: Right. Seemed quite enough to make it seem really spoiled. 
COUNSELOR: Well you could call it that but there's something, you know, it's, I take it a little more seriously than that it's spoiled but I take it more like you're a good person with real needs which ought to be met by other people and the world and things. And that sort of, there's something right about that. And there's something terribly wrong about them not being met. 0:25:49.4
PATIENT: And I guess I'm really confused on what it means to be said no to.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Do you understand that? 
COUNSELOR: A little bit but maybe you should lay it out for me. 
PATIENT: It's very hard for me to lay out. And it was hard for me to formulate it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like some incomprehensible blow on the head or something. 
PATIENT: No. Well it's that too but that's not what I meant.
COUNSELOR: No. 
PATIENT: The only time I ever say no to somebody is when I don't like them.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: I've got, that's like I have no sense of priority about work. Like if a friend says you know I really want to talk to you, you know. And I have like a test the next day right. And I'll say yes if I like them. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: You know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I've always done that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 0:27:57.8
PATIENT: You know and that's and my parents have always said, the only time they've said no is really when they're doing this thing of disapproving of me heavily. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: And attached to that is not loving me. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: So being said no to is very difficult for me to put any kind of perspective on. 
COUNSELOR: Sure. It's like because you couldn't quite believe it was any different. Not really. 
PATIENT: Right. But at the same time I've really always have respected people who say no. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: Diane says no. Carmen says no. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I don't have this feeling that I'd hate you if you say no.
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
PATIENT: It isn't like that. 
COUNSELOR: No. No..
PATIENT: You'd think I'd have a really funny feeling. Like I wouldn't quite know what to do with that information. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: It wouldn't quite fit. Because I like you a bunch.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And feel like I can be open with you. And feel like in some way you care. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: So it doesn't quite fit that you would say no, right? 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You'd just be, you'd be wounded and not quite understand. I mean it wouldn't make sense. 
PATIENT: But also just, I really don't want to do that thing that I've promised to do. There's this horrible thing. I've got to put together all these cards and you know. And then they'll totally self evaluate you. You know and.. 0:30:16.9
COUNSELOR: Oh the, the research? 
PATIENT: Yeah. And I'm just like, there's just hours of that.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: As I remember. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Where it's just a complete drag. And I really have a sick feeling life this whole thing is going as big as this room, not even as big as this room. It's been from about where the desk begins to over here because I never look over there. Yuk. I don't need that. 
COUNSELOR: Just you know yuk thinking about it. 
PATIENT: I want some ice cream.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I also feel very young all of a sudden. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: You don't like that? I feel like I'm talking like a kid. A little girl.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. A little girl who wants..
PATIENT: Who wants ice cream. Who doesn't want to be hurt. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Doesn't want to be asked to do crummy things. Wants people to be warm to her. 0:32:01.2
PATIENT: I really didn't like the way you just said that. It's the first time I've had that feeling. I just all of a sudden really resented you saying that. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm. Who the hell are you? 
PATIENT: This is all really classic.
COUNSELOR: Hmm?
PATIENT: This is all really classic. 0:34:00.0
COUNSELOR: I think I understood it a little better after I thought about it. It was like, it was sort of like, "You bitch how dare you seduce me into wanting that when you know you're, there's something false about sympathizing with my wanting to and it's all warm and you're not holding that out." 
PATIENT: There was something particularly like cuddly about how you said that word and that seemed like you could just turn it on or something. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm. Um hmm.
PATIENT: You know it was an act to you.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm. Because it seems like only pretense you sit there and it's just something I can do well. 
PATIENT: It's also really hard to dislike you. Like I was holding on to it for a minute. Just looking at other, listening to the phone. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I was trying to hold on to feeling resentful.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And you just did a very Rene-like thing. I mean you just made a mannerism or something.
COUNSELOR: Humm?
PATIENT: You just did some mannerism just a minute ago that made me..
COUNSELOR: Oh, hmm. 
PATIENT: I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: It took your resentment away. 0:36:02.4
PATIENT: As quickly as it came. Oh fuck. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Is that oh fuck, what a mess? 
PATIENT: More that, I'm just a little bit confused with myself. Because for a minute I wanted to not like you. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: And it's all really obvious to me that it's because I'm worried about I may not see you so it's much nicer to have ambivalent feelings toward you than to really like you a bunch. And then and that it would be pretty understandable that I won't be able to see you. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: It's also aggravating to (inaudible at 0:37:30.8) play these kinds of games with myself. (inaudible at 0:37:35.6)
COUNSELOR: There was something about it. I don't know I guess like you said it was classic or something that you don't like to see yourself doing. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. And I guess it does scare me a little because Holly's going out Saturday, Sunday morning. And Jen's moving out. And then I won't see you either. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Too many people to lose all at once. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Because I also just know cry in some way except that you aren't there (inaudible at 0:38:50.2.) So it feels like I'm losing a real friend. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. I see what you mean. Yeah, like in your mind all the time we're friends and you know so well we have this peculiar thing where we meet two hours a week. That's a little peculiar but basically it's like being friends. (chuckles)
PATIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. I think it's like a, I don't know. Like I feel always like I shouldn't quite ask about you. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.0:39:58.6
PATIENT: But it's really much more that I shouldn't ask than that I don't want to ask. Because I'd really much rather, I mean I really want to know. But I always have like "no, no." (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: (chuckles) No, no little girl you behave. You be good. 
PATIENT: Well not that. It's just like don't trespass.
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's much more trespass than be good. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I know it's like I ask you how was your day is. And you just say kinda ok. You don't really tell me that you know you closes friend said "So and so" or you're having trouble with who your living with, or you have another boyfriend, or got a letter from your parents. You never tell me these things. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I think a lot about asking. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Because I never really know. I never, I'm sure that's like it's the nice part about being a therapist. Because you're in a way, in a way protected position. Something. That's what I think. Because I never know if you're really nice and understanding to everybody. Or if it has to be or if it's like some people have ways of just being generally that way. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Or is it that you really care about me or understand that.
COUNSELOR: Like and like if I told you things like I got a letter from my parents and stuff in my life well, it would make it, it would be more of a relationship. Like you, you'd know me. 
PATIENT: I just also got this flash that in some way there's a beautiful girl. And in some way I would act different to you. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: The thing about that. You know like a lot of times I act really young here. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: More young than I ever let myself act anywhere else. And sometimes it feels good just to be able to. And sometimes it feels like being myself. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Like I don't have to act this way but the relationship and that, here you are this person who's, I mean nobody except for my mother ever listened to everything I had to say.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sound like you just get set up for it.
PATIENT: Yeah. Mostly I can just like watch my voice. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: And it gets littler or..
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Something. But it isn't necessarily at other times.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Preferably something that you want to say that you know, but I'm not just that.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Very much so. Most of the time there I sit little. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: Sit. I feel like I must be in the wrong place. [I'll start doing that] (ph) like you. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:44:30.9) 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. Because you, you don't respect too much of that in yourself. But a little bit is ok. 
PATIENT: Yeah. A little bit of it is ok. I mean it's there and I don't have to nurse it, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 0:45:02.2
PATIENT: It's kinda (inaudible at 0:45:04.3) (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: I don't know. I guess I'm always a little bit scared to ask you how you feel. 
COUNSELOR: Because of like what you said before, like it's trespassing. 
PATIENT: Like I don't know where the boundaries are and so I associate so.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 0:46:03.0
PATIENT: A lot stick in my head you know and like I'd like to expand them. So I don't know where they really are.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: So I don't know how to appreciate them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I just, hasn't therapy, doesn't therapy relationship seem strange to you? Like how do you feel about me? 
COUNSELOR: I guess I've been around so long that they don't seem. Like I know how that goes. 
PATIENT: How does it go? It's kinda good for what it is and that's all it is?
COUNSELOR: I think. I don't know. I guess maybe I've given up being frustrated about it. I think when I was first in therapy I was very, very frustrated because I remember. 
PATIENT: Did you go to therapy with (inaudible at 0:47:14.9) 
COUNSELOR: No. I, sometimes he'll listen to me if I have trouble with something. It's not be given formal therapy. Why do you ask? 
PATIENT: I just, before I came here I just ran into Martina Veno. She's nice and she's a friend of Cantons. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: She's kinda being in time focuses.
COUNSELOR: Oh yeah. 
PATIENT: I've been helping her out (inaudible at 0:47:57.7) 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: We both mentioned that we thought you would be just one of the finest therapist. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I was just wondering if I knew anybody who had ever had therapy with him (inaudible at 0:48:08.2) I'm sure he is. I'm sure he's like incredible. It's a really nice day for a walk. I have to work today though. 
COUNSELOR: Oh. When you say you don't want to trespass. Do you mean you don't want me to get mad at you or you don't want to make a bad thing between us? Or you don't want me to say no to you? (inaudible at 0:49:36.4) Maybe you'd ask me something and I'd tell you and I wouldn't really want to. 
PATIENT: What are you going to do? (inaudible at 0:49:51.2) Unless you say like I don't really know because it's such an honor to show them (inaudible at 0:50:00.9) basically. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You don't have, you don't, you can't say no I don't want to like even to your friends you can say well.. 
COUNSELOR: I don't want to tell you. 
PATIENT: I'm going to be busy for the next couple weeks, right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You can't say no to me that way because you have to, you made a pledge to see me for twenty times. 
COUNSELOR: Right. 
PATIENT: So..
COUNSELOR: So then I..
PATIENT: I don't want to ask you and have you, I don't want something that feels kinda pushed. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: You know. You'd tell me because you think I need it or something. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh, uh huh.
PATIENT: I mean I don't want it to be that right. I don't want you to feel obligated to tell me that maybe that will make me trust me more or something. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 
PATIENT: I don't want it to be so much a relation to me although of course it is. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:51:00.5) But I you know I don't you know (inaudible at 0:51:08.8) you like I think I knew that about yourself Rene. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. 
PATIENT: You know and it's like I don't want to trespass on what you don't feel comfortable telling me. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: But I also would like you to feel comfortable telling me that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: Since you haven't, I figure well she hasn't..
COUNSELOR: I must not want to.
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And you don't think I'll say no if I don't want to. 
PATIENT: Well, well I never even thought of that. I guess you could just say no couldn't you? I guess I just don't like hearing no. 
COUNSELOR: I guess often like, I don't like often like, you'll ask me. You'll say, "What am I supposed to do Rene?" And I won't say, "No, I can't tell you that." I'll sort of laugh with you and won't answer you. 0:52:07.2
PATIENT: Well when I say things like that I mean I know that I am saying them because it's inside me but I know I'm not really..
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I would like it if you could somehow (inaudible at 0:52:19.8) truth from Olympus. 
COUNSELOR: Right. But that's really different. Because like when you're asking me about I think you're seriously asking me. 
PATIENT: Yeah. And those are times just like, "Oh come on Rene." (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: You know I don't really like..
COUNSELOR: Yeah. There's a time, it's not too..
PATIENT: Yeah, serious. Whereas yeah. The thing is I guess I've been (inaudible at 0:52:46.6) it's comfortable because I'm somehow in my head then. I haven't been told no. And somehow I've been told no and that limit's have been put on it I'm scared that I'd close up. I usually do. I don't know how to deal with it really.
COUNSELOR: Limits are put on like you lose some kind of open ended trust. 
PATIENT: Yeah. Well somehow because I mean you're not a whole person, or not even potentially a whole person to me..
COUNSELOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: You're really only a person who will just sit in and listen to me. And you'll certainly tell me what you're thinking at the time. And you'll like respond in your own way to what I say. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: But it's just so completely glued to my world, right?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And so you not being a complete person is a very incredible weird concept. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: That isn't very palatable. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it makes you. There's something in it that you disrespect too. 0:53:59.6
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Especially when you're so obviously a whole full person. 
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. 
PATIENT: But also I can't see how I can even be that therapeutic (inaudible at 0:54:18.2) It just seems catering to it kinda be (inaudible at 0:54:24.4) and be that I don't need them.
COUNSELOR: Hmm. Or somehow you don't want to be one sided just taking like being childish.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Like sometimes when I say something I really felt this just incredibly when I first started saying it,
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: That when I said things I wanted to do be critical of them in a way. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Not critical like, "that was a very bad thing to say." You know like that. But just like, why you know, like I all of a sudden just for a minute had this resentful feeling about you like that. So I told you, right? And I wanted you wanted to be able to, I guess maybe I almost wanted you to be able to have that experience about me to maybe. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: I wanted you to like be effected enough by me so that you would...
COUNSELOR: Get mad at you.
PATIENT: Just like me or get pissed at what I say or you know like or something. Because then that means I would effecting you. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. That would be like the real back and forth relationship. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And partly you want that because it's not so infantile and partly because it's warmer or something. And partly because you're used to it. 
PATIENT: Yeah. All those things exactly. Each one of those. 0:56:00.0
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And sometimes just like I can tell like a look in your eyes a whole bunch more than I can a lot. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yeah when you're just talking to me. 
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: I don't know why I want us, you're paying some seven fifty or something an hour to have me listen to your world. 
PATIENT: What makes you say that? 
COUNSELOR: Something about that's the out lines of, I don't know, just like, like I don't, I guess like I didn't really realize it or something. Of course you realized it but somehow you didn't take it in or something. 
PATIENT: Yeah. But even, but even so, I can still see being a hopeful person. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean, you know. Yeah I am paying you. And in that way it's a completely defined business relationship.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. 
PATIENT: But still you can be a whole person. Still you can tell me how you're feeling about, because I must be affecting you somehow. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because you can't have to be relating without you being affected in some way. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Probably not to the extent that I am because you're probably not involved to that extent. But I can't believe that you're not affected at all. 0:58:10.9
COUNSELOR: Uh huh. Uh huh. 
PATIENT: At least I'm very scared to think that you wouldn't be affected at all. That would probably confirm my worst fears. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: But I couldn't believe that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. But that would like be sort of like super cold. It would be like being a Mr. Beards or something. 
PATIENT: Right. And besides that wouldn't be you. You're not. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: But.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I see what you mean. Like it truly is peculiar and ambiguous. 
PATIENT: Um hmm. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's good to be saying this. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I can imagine. 
PATIENT: I feel more separated but I feel I can sit up straighter. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Most of the times I woke up kinda like [my toes between my leg] (ph) but I've been pounded on the head. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Like it's warm but I'm all frazzled and stuff. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. Yeah. You're nervous. 
PATIENT: And I feel more connected to you lots of times than I do right now. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But like a connection feels more eye to eye or something. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I don't know what to say to that. But that's what you mean. Yeah, yeah. Like it's a little bit lonelier and it's a little colder. But it's, there's something, something stronger in it and something more grown up in it or something. 1:00:27.9
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You like yourself a little better feeling that way. 
PATIENT: What? 
COUNSELOR: You feel, you like yourself better that way. You have a good picture of me. It doesn't feel icky. 
PATIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: Yeah, it's not, there's something very nice about it. Feeling warm and taken care of every time I leave here. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Because that's what your smile always does. It makes me feel really like, just very good. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But I always feel like I'm going out on three legs too. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: You worked down from four. (laughs) 
PATIENT: I should say, appreciate that, right? (laughs) 1:02:03.6
COUNSELOR: (laughs) I think that's absolutely the silliest thing I've said all week. Because it's, you meant something reasonably serious like about it feels good to stand up on your own two feet and be whole and be enough for yourself. 
PATIENT: And also there's some kind of like satisfaction being able to view you in some way. Instead of just sometimes I just feel like, Rene just go away.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: And lots of times like I walk out like I saw Tricia one time walking. And I was just all full of like talking about Rene. And you were like all pervasive and all around me right. And or something. 
COUNSELOR: But you didn't have any power to stand off and look at me. 
PATIENT: Right. And I do have some, you know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And seeing you as just a person too, right is just a very impossibly not completely right. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm. 
PATIENT: Whatever right means, whatever it pertains to. It brings it back on a ground that I can deal with. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: And I guess it makes you a person instead of a therapist. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
PATIENT: As a therapist you always do that omnition trip on.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm, um hmm. yeah. 
PATIENT: You know? And that's part of what I'm uncomfortable with. 
COUNSELOR: And you would like to be, you to be able to be critical of me and I want to be able..
PATIENT: Critical is always like the wrong word. Because I don't mean like picking on you and scrutinizing you or you scrutinizing me and saying that's fucked up or this is wrong or something. I just mean something. Do you know what I mean? 1:04:01.4
COUNSELOR: Sort of. You want me to be able to see clearly. See better than you can and help you see better. 
PATIENT: No, I don't. I don't understand what you're saying. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
PATIENT: I mean I want. You go on. 
COUNSELOR: Just to, to be able to see stuff that you can't see. And so let you see more of yourself. No?
PATIENT: Well, that's not, does not have anything to do with what I'm saying. What I was saying was that I wanted to be able to look at you and be able to see the things that I thought were real good and the things I didn't think were real good. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: But somehow to take you back down to be a person instead of..
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: Being a...
COUNSELOR: Being separate.
PATIENT: Yeah separate and separate but equal. (chuckles) That's true and it's not true at the same time. I mean because I also keep on asking you for, I want you to come up with very insightful things I couldn't quite get to. The thing is I, I don't know. I also feel capable of that about other people too. 
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
PATIENT: So, I don't know. Now I'm getting. It's just like so many things go on at the same time about you right.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
PATIENT: It happens with everybody. But particularly you. 
COUNSELOR: We should be quitting. 1:05:58.0
PATIENT: Could I see you tomorrow too?
COUNSELOR: Yeah I think so. Sure. 
PATIENT: Because we have another three things to do. 
COUNSELOR: Another?
PATIENT: Because we have like an extra or something. One extra. I was just (inaudible at 1:06:35.3)
COUNSELOR: Sure. 
PATIENT: When are you free? 
COUNSELOR: How about ten in the morning? 
PATIENT: Maybe later. Anytime except for (inaudible at 1:06:48.5)
COUNSELOR: Or in the afternoon?
PATIENT: That's real good. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
PATIENT: I take it you're reading for in the morning. 
COUNSELOR: Hmm? Oh well. 
PATIENT: I really like him. This is really incredible. 
COUNSELOR: I've never read her. 
PATIENT: I think you'd really like her.
COUNSELOR: What has she written?
PATIENT: Well I'm reading her diary. As a matter of fact I'd like to give you something. I'd like to give you that. 
COUNSELOR: Oh, I'd like that. That would be a nice present from you. Thank you.
