MY DEAR FRIEND,


I HAVE informed you in my last letter, that
when I was about twelve years old, I was taken
from school, and removed to Birmingham. After
making several trials, I became at length an apprentice
to an engraver, for the term of seven years.
My new connexions produced no moral improvement,
and served only to strengthen my attachment
to the follies and vices in which I was initiated at
school. The family in which I lived, during the
greater part of my engagement, afforded no semblance
of piety, with the single exception of a partial
attendance, by some members of it, on public worship
on the Sundays. Nearly all the family were
notoriously profane and immoral, especially the heads
of it, though they had the reputation among their
neighbours of being respectable and good kind of
people, very attentive to business, and of increasing
wealth. My mother lived at no great distance from
me, and for some time retained so much influence
over me as to constrain my attendance at church,
when I was unable to devise a feasible pretext for
neglecting it, which I very often did, that in company

Such was my mode of life until I was about seventeen;
a mode unhappily too common, and utterly
undeserving a record, but for the sake of recounting
the manner in which I was induced to relinquish it
The first symptoms of any amendment originated in
an apprehension that I was living in a way displeasing
to God, and likely to expose me to his
indignation. I can readily trace the lively impressions
of fear by which I was occasionally influenced,
in part, to the effect of my education in childhood,
but perhaps in a still greater degree, to the reading
of some books which I found entirely neglected in
the house where I lived. My time was so fully
occupied in business, as to leave no leisure for reading,
and though my desire to read was undiminished,
I had no opportunity to indulge it. At spare moments,
notwithstanding, I contrived to make myself
acquainted with the contents of the books to which
I have alluded They were of a kind which I certainly
should not have chosen if I could have obtained
others more suited to my taste; as, however, I had
no choice, I read these. They proved to be odd and
imperfect volumes of old divinity, written by Brooks,
Sheppard, Mede, and others of the same class. The
pungent style in which these books were written,
excited such a degree of religious feeling, as led me to
form purposes of amendment; these, however, were
short-lived, and quickly subsided, leaving me little if
at all improved.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About this time I was so much affected by the
earnest admonitions of a clergyman whom I occasionally
heard, and who strenuously pressed young
persons to be confirmed at an impending celebration
of that rite, that I resolved to comply, and was consequently
confirmed by the Bishop of the diocese.
The notion I formed of this ceremony was, that
before it took place, my baptismal sponsors, one of
whom was a clergyman, were responsible for me,
and that, after it, the responsibility devolved on
myself. This notion powerfully affected me, for
a short time, when, like my previous impressions, it
faded away, without any material amendment. I
still continued to read the books that have been mentioned,
with occasional temporary excitement, which
so far influenced me, as to incline me to relinquish
some of the more flagrant vices to which I was
addicted. Some of the family in which I lived
attended, more or less frequently, an episcopal
chapel, St. Mary's, in the vicinity of which we
resided, and I sometimes accompanied them. Here
I found two clergymen of a class quite different from
any whom I had before heard. They entertained
what are commonly called evangelical opinions,
which they enforced with great zeal and earnestness.
For some time I paid very little attention to
their discourses, as besides my habitual thoughtlessness,
I entertained a strong aversion towards whatever
was esteemed fanatical and methodistical,
though, in fact, I knew very little about the proper
signification of these epithets, and used them as

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By degrees almost imperceptible, my aversion to
these clergymen abated, and my prejudices so far
yielded, as sometimes to allow me to listen to their
discourses with interest and pleasure. My apprehensions
were again and more powerfully excited,
respecting the danger of persisting in my sinful
courses, which, I feared, would drown me in perdition,
and exclude me from every hope of eternal
fife. I found myself, notwithstanding, entirely
unable to control my perverse inclinations, and all
my resolutions vanished like the dew of the morning.
I discovered that I was enslaved to pursuits
which I knew to be criminal, and bound by fetters
which I could not break. Yet I continued to attend
on the ministry of these good men, as I fully believed
them to be, with greater regularity and earnestness:
the result was, that my dread of future retribution
became stronger, so that I struggled hard to liberate
myself from the bondage in which I was held. My
utmost endeavours were, however, vain and ineffectual,
and I continued to be the sport of careless
levity, and the slave of my inconstant dispositions.
For some time I invariably became thoughtful and
sedate on the Sundays, but as invariably relapsed on
the following days, into my habitual state of feeling
and conduct. These alternations of feeling became at
length very distressing; and I was alarmed by fear,
that I should never subdue my propensity to folly
which I found had acquired so entire an ascendency

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The anxious condition that I have described experienced
no abatement until I learnt from the
discourses of the clergyman on whom I attended,
that Divine help was needed in all endeavours to
break the bonds of iniquity, and that such help was
promised in the Gospel to all who earnestly seek
it. On examining the instructions of our blessed
Saviour in the Scriptures, I discovered the words,
“Seek, and ye shall find;” “If you who are evil
know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father who is in heaven,
bestow the Holy Spirit on them that ask
him?”


On these and other similar passages of the sacred
writings I deeply meditated, and resolved to make
the experiment. It is not to be supposed that I had
not before many times read these portions of the
book of God; but they had been passed over and
utterly disregarded, in the desultory and careless
manner in which the sacred writings are so generally
read. I had formerly been made to read these
books, and to commit to memory some parts of
them; but this was imposed as a task, and as a task
I regarded it, without giving myself any trouble to

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before this period, I had been used sometimes to
repeat, in a very cursory way, some short prayers
that I had been taught in my infancy; and now I
knew of no better course to employ, than to recite a
short form, which I found in the Communion Service
of the Liturgy,--“Almighty God, to whom all
hearts are open,” &amp;c.;, to which I added the Lord's
Prayer; and so addressed my first earnest and real
supplications to the unseen God, whom I was desirous
to adore, and of whose promised assistance I was
unfeignedly desirous to avail myself. No perceptible
effect followed; nor had I, indeed, any conception
of the manner in which Divine help is
afforded. I persevered, however, in offering these
supplications, though scarcely, if at all, conscious,
that the fervency with which I did so, greatly
increased. This, however, was the case, and so
greatly did my earnestness advance as to lead me
unconsciously to relinquish the forms I had used,
and to address myself to the Great Being, for whom
I began to feel deep reverence, in words which
spontaneously offered themselves to me; as no
forms appeared to be adapted to express the vivid
emotions of my bosom. The fervour that actuated
me reached such a height, that my thoughts were

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Numerous assurances, in which the Divine favour
is pledged to such as earnestly seek it, were so
powerfully impressed on my attention, that I was
unable to reject the consolations which they proffered,
or to refuse the gracious overtures of the
Most High to become my Father and my God. No
words I can employ are sufficient to describe the
delight that was diffused over my heart, by the
emotions of hope and joy that I experienced, and
which became so intense and continued, as, in
several instances, to intercept my sleep, and keep
me awake through the night.


I do not now recollect exactly how long this
ecstatic state continued; it subsided, however, after
several days, and gave me leisure to reflect on its
nature, and on the surprising effects that were produced
upon me. During the continuance of these
elevated emotions, I was so absorbed by them, that
I scarcely at all reflected on the remarkable condition
of mind to which I was brought. But as
soon as I could calmly consider it, I found myself
possessed of a new character; in place of the levity
and thoughtlessness that had lately made me so
anxious, I was become sedate and steadfast of purpose

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The strong affections by which I had been drawn
to sensual and unworthy pleasures were so changed,
that I could derive no pleasure from them. My
foolish and vicious companions, in whose company
and pursuits I had lately been so deeply engaged,
became distasteful to me; I could no longer associate
with them, or derive any satisfaction from
intercourse with them. My own vicious practices
were become odious to me, and so powerful was the
influence by which I was diverted from them, that of
some flagrant ones, to which I had long been addicted,
I had not even a remembrance for several months.


I now exulted in my new pursuits, and firmly
resolved to attach myself to no other acquaintances
or companions, but such as I should have sufficient
reason to believe were devoted to truth, reason, and
religion. On further examining the state of my heart
and feelings, I was convinced that my conscience had
gained an entire ascendency over my passions and
appetites: my thoughts, desires, and propensities,
cleaved rather to heaven than to earth; and every
inclination to impurity, profaneness, and impiety?
had vanished without any effort of my own to dislodge
them from my bosom.


The only purpose for which life appeared to me
to be desirable was, the acquisition of knowledge and
piety; that I might finally obtain an inheritance in
eternal life. The delightful and most beneficial
occurrences which I have now related, took place, as

I am, &amp;c.; &amp;c.;
