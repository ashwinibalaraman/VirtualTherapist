THERAPIST: Hi Catherine.
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, how are you?
CLIENT: Good.
THERAPIST: It's been a long while. (Laughter)
CLIENT: I know. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: How are things going?
CLIENT: Good, just a little bit more busier at school, but—
THERAPIST: Okay, what happened last week? It was—
CLIENT: I was not feeling well, and I thought that—I had a scare that it was related to my Crohn's, but it was really just period.
THERAPIST: Oh, right. (Laughter)
CLIENT: But I got it early, so I thought like the cramps were related, or something.
THERAPIST: Okay. I'm glad everything is okay.
CLIENT: Yea. And I don't have a doctor right now, so I was like freaking out, but I think I'm getting a new one today.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: So how is like the homework stuff that we were working on, because I know it's been like two weeks, so did you forget to do it?
CLIENT: I know. Well, the going up to someone, I haven't done because I feel like really—I don't know, like, what that's going to do for me? But—
THERAPIST: What's it going to do? Oh, you mean, like, how is it going to benefit you? 0:01:01.9
CLIENT: Yes. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: Well do you think you're fighting whether it's going to benefit you because it's something you don't want to do?
CLIENT: I guess, possibly. But, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Do you want me to explain why I assigned—
CLIENT: Yea. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: And it's like fair enough for you to say, like, "why are we doing this?"
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Well, the going up to a person and kind of saying something stupid is basically about when we talked about, before, a lot of your anxiety stands around the judgments of others and saying stupid things around each other, right; other people that you—don't even know sometimes—but that you respect, that you're worried about judging you—even just perfect strangers. And I think that this would provide a perfect opportunity for you to be judged by a stranger—
CLIENT: I guess. (Laughter) Yea
THERAPIST: And to show you that it wouldn't be completely awful and terrible if someone judged you poorly, and that you could stand it.
CLIENT: I guess I'm more—yea. 0:02:02.5
THERAPIST: And even though you know you can stand it, something else must be going on because you're still not doing it, right?
CLIENT: Yea. I guess I'm more just nervous they're going to get angry, or something, I don't know.
THERAPIST: You're nervous that they're going to get angry?
CLIENT: I guess they wouldn't get angry, I mean I wouldn't get angry, but I don't know how other people—
THERAPIST: If you just asked somebody today, "And you're?"
CLIENT: I guess they wouldn't. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, I guess since it's been a few weeks, and you haven't been able to do this one yet.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: You kind of have two options, because I do think that this is going to benefit you.
CLIENT: I should still do it?
THERAPIST: A few options: we could make them less—we start off with something that, maybe, you would feel less stupid asking. Like would you be uncomfortable just asking someone the time?
CLIENT: No. That would be fine. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: You really think that, or—
CLIENT: No I really think—because I've done that before, I guess, if I see they have a watch on, or something. 0:03:04.1
THERAPIST: Well then now I'm throwing that out the window because that one is so easy for you. And now, I have another idea.
CLIENT: Okay. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: What if we go outside right now and then you do it?
CLIENT: For the time? Okay.
THERAPIST: No, not for the time.
CLIENT: Oh, for that?
THERAPIST: And I'll be there to make sure no one beats you up.
CLIENT: I feel like then I'll be with someone and—
THERAPIST: No but I'm not going to stand with you; I'm going to stand on the side of the street somewhere else and watch you do it. What do you think?
CLIENT: I think I'd feel a little bit better having someone with me, to be honest. It would be a lot easier than doing— I think I've just like, I don't know, if I go up to someone by myself on the street, I don't know if they're going to like— I don't know.
THERAPIST: Well this is a good way to find out what's going to happen.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: Alright? And at worst, it's probably just going to be that they're going to judge you and think that maybe you're an idiot, or a little bit weird.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: Yea?
CLIENT: Probably, but I don't— I think it's easier for me then if someone is with me, even if they're not right near me just because— 0:04:07.4
THERAPIST: Okay, and that's okay. But I think that may be— Do you think that it would be helpful just for you to do it this one time and then it would make it easier for you to do it on your own? Because the point is to get you comfortable with the idea that if you make an ass of yourself, it's okay.
CLIENT: I guess I want to— Alright, I'll try it. Especially on my own, I feel like that would benefit me more because I'm thinking now I feel so much better knowing that you might be with me, or something, that one time. So, I'm just nervous because I feel like every time I think of doing it, I just like, oh no, people are going to get crazy.
THERAPIST: Well, let's like—
CLIENT: You know, deter myself and just don't—
THERAPIST: What would someone do? What is the worst thing that someone could do?
CLIENT: I guess the worst thing someone would do is yell, or something, I don't know. But, I wouldn't yell at someone. (Chuckles) 0:05:04.7
THERAPIST: And right now, we're on midtown east, right? People are pretty civilized here, wouldn't you say?
CLIENT: Yea, I guess I didn't think much of that. I'm thinking about, like, I'm going to pick the worst person in the crowd, or something.
THERAPIST: Well you think you're going to?
CLIENT: No. (Laughter)
THERAPIST: (Laughter) So evidence is pointing against your worst fear.
CLIENT: Yea.
THERAPIST: But I think let's find out.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Yea? So want to take a walk?
CLIENT: Sure. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: Okay.
