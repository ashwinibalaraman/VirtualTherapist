<font size="4"><b>Chapter 18: Coronary Disease and Congestive Heart Disorder</b></font>
[p. <i>249</i>]

<b>Abstract:</b> Coronary artery disease and congestive heart disorder are not just "pump and pipes
problems" to be fixed by wonder drugs and technical wizardry. Dynamic factors including
cardiovascular and biobehavioral components determine the cardiac events and effort tolerance.
Holistic cardiology treats the patient's illness behavior in addition to the anatomical heart. The three
legs of the authors' new model of cardiac care include emotional tools added to the power of pills
and scalpel. Reversing heart disease focuses on teaching patients to measure, monitor, and modify
risk factors, including anger, depression, anxiety, and social isolation. The chapter reviews the
prevailing American and European lifestyle modification protocols and outlines the authors' eclectic
model, which is based on psychophysiological self-regulation and includes biofeedback monitoring
of heart rate variability and structured group support. Although clinical outcome validates the
biobehavioral approach, current medical economics has restricted its use. The authors suggest
integrating "high-touch" behavioral modalities and "high-tech" multimedia computer training tools
into mainstream medical practice.

<b>Medical, Physiological, and Behavioral Profiles of the Disorder</b>

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most
common chronic illness causing death, disability,
and economic loss. In the United
States, over 11 million people have CAD,
and 5 million have congestive heart failure
(CHF). Atherosclerotic narrowing, spasm,
embolus, or blood clot of coronary arteries
reduces blood and oxygen supplies to the
heart muscle, causing myocardial ischemia.
The process affects the bigger epicardial
conductance vessels as well as microvascular
intramyocardial resistance vessels. Transient
ischemia can silently reduce the kinetics of
heart pumping or produce anginal chest
pain. If prolonged, ischemia can lead to
chronic or sudden necrosis and scarring of
the heart muscle. Sudden necrosis can cause
cardiac arrythmia and/or sudden death. CAD
manifests in one of eight clinical patterns:
sudden death, CHF, cardiac arrythmia, heart
attack, unstable angina, Prinzmetal's angina,
angina, or silent ischemia.


CHF is the failure of the heart as a
pump to meet the perfusion requirements of

[p. <i>250</i>]

The malfunctioning heart in CHF causes
chemical dysregulation in three domains:
the sympatho-adrenal system, the reninangiotensin
system, and cytokinins. The sympathetic
arousal releases an unnaturally high
amount of the chemicals norepinephrine
and epinephrine, leading to a vicious cycle of
a weakening heart and worsening insomnia.
The cells of the heart either proliferate,
dilate, fibrose, or atrophy, which in turn
changes the architecture of the entire heart
and makes it less compliant, hypertrophied,
or dilated. This process is called cardiac
remodeling (Packer &amp; Cohn, 1999). The
usual management of CHF includes medications
to decrease the preload (diuretics), augment
cardiac muscle function (digoxin), or
decrease the afterload of peripheral resistance
(ACE inhibitors, beta blockers).
However, recent studies have shown that
there is little relation between cardiac function
recorded by medical tests, including
ejection fraction and the patient's effort tolerance
(Consensus Trial Study Group, 1990).
A newer approach to treating CHF is to view
it as a dynamic, partially reversible disorder
that can be improved by changing the underlying
chemistry noninvasively. Diastolic
heart failure, which is the failure of the heart
to relax (as opposed to systolic heart failure,
the failure to contract), is partly dependent
on how well the heart recuperates from the
hyperaroused chemistry of the day. Sleep and
stress control increase the diastolic functioning
of the heart (Nixon, 1986b).

<b>Anatomy and Physiology of Cardiac Dynamics</b>

Blood flow to the heart is supplied by right
and left coronary arteries. Epicardial arteries
are often regarded as conductance vessels,
and myocardial microvasculature is regarded
as a system of resistance vessels. However,
the epicardial vessels are not passive conduits;
they have a calcium-dependent resting
tone and a catecholamine-dependent potential
for spasm, even if denervation occurs
after bypass surgery or transplant (Freeman
&amp; Nixon, 1985). In atherosclerotic segments
of coronary arteries, endothelial
dysfunction occurs, causing paradoxical or
hypersensitive spasm during exercise and
mental stress.


Blood flow through intramyocardial resistance
vessels depends on the perfusion gradient
(aortic pressure minus coronary sinus
pressure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure)
and the diastolic time available for
flow. Rapid heart rate during anxiety or
physical stress may impose a handicap on the
heart by decreasing diastolic filling and lowering
coronary perfusion (Nixon, 1986b).


Conventional risk factors for coronary
artery disease are grouped as (1) uncontrollable
factors, such as increasing age,
male sex, and hereditary predisposition; and
(2) controllable factors of high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes,
obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Psychosocial
factors fall into five domains: hostility.
chronic stress, anxiety, depression, and
social isolation (Rozanski, Blumentnal, &amp;
Kaplan, 1999).

<b>Typical Symptom Profile and Assessment</b>
[p. <i>251</i>]

CAD typically presents with chest pain,
which may radiate to the left arm or the jaw,
and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,
sweating, and shortness of breath. This
symptom complex is called angina pectoris.
Clinically, angina is classified according to
the precipitant and duration. If it occurs only
during exertion and has been stable for a
long period, it is called stable angina. If
pain occurs at rest, it is unstable angina.
Prinzmetal's angina involves recurrent
attacks due to transient spasm of coronary
arteries. If the pain persists and leads to
necrosis of the heart muscle, it is myocardial
infarction (heart attack). Asymptomatic
(silent) ischemia refers to ST segment depression
in the electrocardiogram without any
chest pain. CAD may weaken the heart as a
pump and lead to CHF--congestion from
fluid in the lungs and peripheral tissues. CHF
presents as breathlessness (dyspnea), especially
when lying down (orthopnea), fatigue,
and effort intolerance.


The diagnosis of CAD is based on the
history, physical examination, resting EKG,
exercise stress test, cardiac enzymes, echocardiogram,
and coronary angiogram. The EKG
usually shows a depression of ST segment in
angina, although in Prinzmetal's angina it
could be elevated. Heart attack may be silent
or present with sudden severe chest pain,
irregular heartbeats, shock, or death. EKG
findings of heart attack could have Q waves
besides ST segment depression and inverted
T waves. Necrosis of the heart muscle shows
up as elevated cardiac enzymes such as CK-MB
and troponin 1. An echocardiogram
during angina or heart attack may show
segmental wall motion abnormality. Coronary
nary angiogram confirms the location and
extent of blockage in the coronary arteries.
CHF is diagnosed by patient history, the
presence of edema in the feet, distension of
neck veins, X-ray finding of an enlarged
heart, and hemodynamic studies of reduced
cardiac output and elevated ventricular
diastolic pressure.

<b>Conventional Medication Treatment and Its Shortcomings</b>

The conventional treatment of heart disease
dwells on pills and the scalpel. Medications
are given to dilate the pipes, improve the
pump, and change the blood--that is, to
reduce blood volume, change the cholesterol-related
atherogenic chemistry, and reduce
clotting potential. The surgical approach
revascularizes by angioplasty, stent, atherectomy,
or bypass grafts. The shortcomings of
conventional treatment are epitomized by
Nixon (1986b) as an "attempt to reconstruct
the broken egg." Alternative treatments
focus on going after the forces that broke the
egg in the first place. Only 50 percent of
patients with CAD have high cholesterol
(Braunwald, 1997), which supports the logic
of addressing other risk factors, including the
psychophysiology based on dynamic factors
(Nixon &amp; Freeman, 1987).

<b>Dynamic Factors in Heart Disease</b>

Coronary arteries, like the esophagus or
intestines, are dynamic, not rigid pipes.
CAD is a bell-shaped curve (King &amp; Nixon,
1988). On the upslope of the curve are people
with significant artery blockage hut no
symptoms, on the downslope are people with
significant symptoms but no fixed blockage,
and in the middle are individuals with both.
This means that much of CAD is due not to

[p. <i>252</i>]

The dynamic factors of CAD can be cardiac
and extracardiac (Freeman &amp; Nixon,
1985). Cardiac factors come from "pipes"
and "pumps." Constriction of the systemic
veins acting as capacitance vessels can empty
a liter or more blood into the heart and
lungs, increasing the preload. Constriction of
systemic resistance vessels raises the afterload
pressure against which the ventricles must
work. Constriction of coronary artery vasomotor
tone or sudden coronary spasm can
cut off circulation to the heart muscle. These
pump dynamics depend on the physical and
mental stress level, hyperventilation, and
resulting calcium-magnesium balance.


The myocardial pump can be temporarily
"stunned" (Braunwald &amp; Kloner, 1982) or
stiffened by the ischemic insult during the
dynamic narrowing of coronary arteries.
Stiffening can be temporarily induced by
stress-induced catabolic toxicity of sympatho-adrenomedullary
(S-AM) and pituitary-adrenocortical
(P-AC) hormones. Repeated
stunning may lead to fibrosis and permanent
stiffening. Subendocardial ischemia producing
stiffness can occur during stress-induced
tachycardia, reducing diastolic coronary
blood flow. The net effect of these cardiac
dynamic factors is to reduce left ventricular
compliance affecting pressure-volume relationships.
Normally, a large volume of blood
is accepted with minimal rise of pressure.
This explains the effort intolerance and day-to-day
change in symptoms based on stress
arousal (Nixon, 1986a).


The extracardiac dynamic factors are
dependent on the stress and coping abilities
of the individual. Nixon developed his nshaped
curve to measure the relationship
between stress arousal and performance. On
the upslope, performance increases with
effort. After the peak, more effort gives
diminishing returns due to a lack of reserve
energy in the body. As in beating a tired
horse, the gap between intended target and
reality widens. Catabolic pathways lead to
vital exhaustion (Nixon, 1986b), and the
brain's information channels get overloaded,
affecting cognitive functions (Lipowski,
1975). The quality and quantity of sleep
decreases, disturbing the body's anabolic
healing power (Adam &amp; Owaid, 1984).

<b>Research on Behavioral Intervention</b>

<b><i>Anger</i></b>


There have been three types of anger
research. The first was that of Type A behavior.
In 1974, cardiologists Friedman and
Rosenman did an 8.5-year study on 3,000
men and found that Type A behavior was
associated with twice the incidence of CAD.
Three components in the Type A profile are

[p. <i>253</i>]

The second kind of research showed that
hostility is the toxic core of Type A behavior.
A Duke University study, led by Dembroski
and colleagues in 1985, looked at 12,000 men
and found that the key element of Type A is
hostility (Dembroski, MacDougall, Williams,
Haney, &amp; Blumenthal, 1985). The time
urgency and competitiveness of Type A correlated
poorly with heart disease. On the
other hand, hostility was strongly correlated
to CAD, as documented by angiography
(Williams, 1989). In 1983, University of
North Carolina research, using 25 years of
follow-up, showed that the death rate among
angry doctors and lawyers was five times
higher than that of their counterparts who
were not angry (Williams, 1989, p. 57).
A report published in 1996 in the <i>Mayo
Clinic Proceedings</i> stated that people with
high anger measured by the Spielberger
State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory had
2.5 times higher chance of reclogging their
arteries after angioplasty (Goodman, Quigly,
Moran, Milman, &amp; Sherman, 1996).


The third type of anger research is that of
measuring the real-time effects of anger on
the heart. In 1993, a Stanford study showed
that recalled anger leads to spasm of the
atherosclerotic segment of the coronary artery
as seen on angiogram (Boltwood, 1993).
A Miami University study showed that
recalled anger decreases the ejection fraction,
or pumping power of the heart as seen on
echocardiogram (Ironson, Taylor, Bartsokis,
Dennis, &amp; Chesney, 1992). In 1998, our
study showed that the ejection fraction of the
heart can be significantly improved by
biofeedback-assisted anger control in heart
patients (Bhat &amp; Bhat, 1999). A study
conducted at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center showed that anger-induced irregularity
(called heart rate variability, or HRV) happens
more often during the day while a person
engages in angry transactions than it does at
night during sleep (Sloan, 1994). Patients in a
Yale University study wore a special camera
called an electronic stethoscope to measure the
pumping power of the heart moment by
moment (Jain, Burg, &amp; Soufer, 1995). The
study showed that during anger episodes, the
ejection fraction of the heart drops and that
the more such events a given person experiences,
the higher the likelihood of developing
cardiac events, including a heart attack.


Two kinds of heart attacks occur during
stress and anger (Eliot, 1994): (1) coronary
artery blockage and coagulation necrosis,
which occur when the kinking spasm and
clogging clot of the coronary arteries cuts off
of oxygen and blood to the heart muscle; and
(2) chemical burn to the heart and contraction
band necrosis, in which the anger chemical,
norepinephrine, increases and literally
causes a chemical burn to one or more heart
muscle fibers, triggering an electrical storm
called ventricular fibrillation, which can
result in death. Cardiologist Robert Eliot
(1994) studied NASA engineers aged 28 to 35
who dropped dead when they were laid off
suddenly during the Kennedy era. Autopsies
showed that they did not have CAD but died
of "heart burn" resulting from frustration
and anger.


The antidote for anger is learned altruism.
The "Mother Teresa effect" is an increase of
immune power during altruism. Harvard psychologist
David McLelland looked at the salivary
immunoglobulin A (IgA) in two groups
of medical students (McClelland &amp; Kirshnite,
1988). The first group watched a movie of
Mother Teresa ministering to the underprivileged.
The second group watched a movie of
violence. The Mother Teresa movie led to
increased IgA, and violent movies decreased
IgA. In addition, during the Mother Teresa
movie, the HRV was smooth and regular,
and during the violent movie the HRV was

[p. <i>254</i>]

<b><i>Depression</i></b>


Depression increases the CAD risk three-fold.
Hopelessness (Ritcher, 1957), the magnitude
of depression, and future cardiac
events are closely correlated (Anda et al.,
1993). Vital exhaustion has the symptom
triad of fatigue, irritability, and demoralized
feelings and predicts future cardiac events
(Appels &amp; Mulder, 1988). At least three
detrimental psychobiological changes cluster
together in depression: hypercortisolemia,
impaired platelet function, and reduced HRV
(Rozanski et al., 1999).


<b><i>Anxiety</i></b>


Anxiety is associated with sudden cardiac
death (Kawachi, Sparrow, Vokonas, &amp;
Weiss, 1994) and reduced baroreflex control
of the heart (Watkin, Grossman, Krishanan,
&amp; Sherwood, 1998). Karasek, Baker,
Marxer, Ahlbom, and Theorell (1981) found
that job strain of high demand but low decision
latitude was associated with a fourfold
increase in cardiovascular deaths. Eliot
(1994) found increased cardiac events in
"hot reactors" who respond with heightened
heart rate and blood pressure reactive to
physical or mental challenge.


<i><b>Social Isolation</b></i>


Lack of social network, intimacy, and
instrumental support such as access to
guidance and practical community services
increases CAD risk at least threefold
(Rozanski et al., 1999). Acculturation
negatively affects CAD, as shown in Japanese
Americans (Marmot &amp; Syme, 1976) and
Italian Americans (Egolf, Lasker, Wolf, &amp;
Potvin, 1992). Isolation increases blood
cortisol level, heart rate, and urinary adrenaline
level (Gerin, Pieper, Levy, &amp; Pickering,
1992).

<b>Mind-Body Interventions: What are the Choices for Heart Disease?</b>

Before a person gets heart disease, he or she
has the choice of preventing it or waiting till
the "crack shows you light." Once heart
disease happens, the choices are to live and
die with it or die from it.


When it comes to treatment, there are two
levels of choices: patient's choice and
doctor's choice. The patient's choice is based
on whether she or he believes in "pill power"
or "skill power." The doctor's choice is based
on the era of medicine, as delineated by
Dossey (1993), to which the doctor belongs.


• Era I: Techno-medicine or allopathic modern
medicine based on tests, gadgets,
surgery, and pills. This era is based on the
paradigm of a mind-body split as formulated
by Rene Descartes in the 17th century.


• Era II: Mind-body healing using hypnosis,
meditation, imagery, and biofeedback. This
era started in the 1950s.


• Era III: Transpersonal medicine based on
the power of prayer, altruism, group support,
and human connectedness. This era
started in the 1980s.


The eclectic way to treat heart disease is to
take advantage of all three eras of medicine,
drawing on the power of pills to correct
blood factors such as cholesterol, the power
of the scalpel to open up plumbing blockages,
and the power of the mind and spirit to
retool the emotional imbalance.

[p. <i>255</i>]

<b><i>Nixon's Stress Control Model</i></b>


Peter Nixon (1993), from London's
Charing Cross Hospital, developed a model
of reversing heart disease primarily by managing
stress and controlling chronic hyperventilation
and vigilance. The method
involves regulating six elements of lifestyle
that form the acronym SABRES: <i>S</i> for sleep,
<i>A</i> for stress arousal, <i>B</i> for breathing, R for
rest, <i>E</i> for effort, and <i>S</i> for self-esteem. This
is pioneer work in the emotional rehabilitation
of heart disease. Dean Ornish (1990), in
the United States, built a model based on
lifestyle changes, including low-fat diet,
stress control by yoga and meditation, exercise,
and group support.


<i><b>Psychophysiological Protocol</b></i>


To a program of lifestyle changes, Naras
Bhat (1995) added the component of anger
control using bio feed back monitoring of
heart rate variability. This model takes the
patient from point A--a life of matter and
motion--to point B--a life of matter, motion,
and emotion. On the way, the individual uses
measuring tools, monitoring tools, and modifying
tools. The modifying tools include
uprooting anger, meditation and imagery,
self-disclosure, rest and activity, and mindful
eating of a low-fat vegetarian diet.


The psychophysiological approach combines
patient education and treatment before
and after cardiac events. The program has
three distinct components: books and tapes
(Bhat, 1995; Ornish, 1990), weekly group
meetings, and clinic visits. The weekly group
class is two hours long and consists of guided
meditation, discussion of one aspect of the
psychophysiology of the heart, and a sharing
ritual. The clinic visits use biofeedback, computers,
and multimedia educational models
extensively. The emotional tools include measuring,
monitoring, and modifying protocols
of mind-body dynamics. Five modifying
tools are used: uprooting anger, meditation
and imagery, self-disclosure, rest and activity,
and mindful eating. Typically, there are
five structured clinic visits with specific
homework assignments. The following sections
summarize the treatment protocol.

<b><i>Outcome Studies</i></b>


The simple intervention of a nurse monitoring
the symptoms of psychological stress
after myocardial infarction produced a 50 percent
reduction in mortality after one year
compared with controls (Frasure-Smith &amp;
Prince, 1985). In a randomized study of 862
post-infarction patients, interventions to
reduce Type A behavior reduced mortality by
50 percent (Friedman et al., 1986). Ornish
et al. (1990) did a randomized study of 28
angiographically documented CAD patients
who ate a vegetarian diet; practiced yoga,
meditation, and exercise; and received stress
management training and group support.
After four years, angiography showed a 4 percent
regression of blockage in the study group
compared with 10 percent progression in the
control group. A meta-analysis of psychosocial
stress reduction in CAD patients showed a
50 percent reduction in the combined rate of
mortality (Nunes, Frank, &amp; Kornfeld, 1987).
All these studies had sample sizes ranging
from 200 to 1,000 compared with more than
23,000 subjects in a beta-blocker drug study
(Yusuf, Peto, &amp; Lewis, 1985).

<b>Future Directions for Mind-Body Intervention</b>

Although the efficacy of psychosocial interventions
in CAD and CHF is evidence based,
there is a lack of effectiveness due to organizational,
financial, and educational limitations.
The medical system is well organized to focus
on "putting out the fire" but not for providing
fire retardant or reconstruction after the fire.
Health care providers are poorly reimbursed
for prevention and rehabilitation compared
with acute care. Several hospitals have
reduced or terminated their cardiac rehabilitation
programs due to lack of funding. In
addition, primary care physician training seldom
includes psychosocial and alternative
modalities. The Kaiser Permanente system has
attempted to overcome these logistics by using
nurse case managers in their MULTIFIT program
(DeBusk, 1996).


One solution we find promising is to use
multimedia and Internet tools to provide
low-cost patient education and health care
provider training. By combining high-tech
and high-touch methods, the focus of treatment
shifts from disease management to
patient management. As Osler (1932) said,
"It is important to know what kind of
patient has the disease rather than what kind
of disease the patient has."
