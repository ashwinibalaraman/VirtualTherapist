Those first few mornings were fairy tales, tall tales,
replete with all the bent beauty of a new world. I
saw a raven, an egg full of gold. I blinked and
blinked again. I started to understand that, like Gretel,
I might need a map, a scatter of something to mark
my way, but when it comes to deciphering health
there is surprisingly little help. The Judeo-Christian
tradition, of which I am firmly a part, views health as a
gift from God and therefore decisively good. The Western
medical profession, which grew directly out of our
Judeo-Christian culture, takes things one step further,
claiming health is not only good but natural. After all,
when you are sick, there are plenty of places (insurance
willing) where you can go to get healed, but when
you are healed are there any places you can go to learn

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Certainly some of our most influential healers have
not viewed health as an alien form of beauty. Freud
envisioned the human body as a rather banal hydraulic
machine seeking to maintain homeostasis at all times, a
humming equilibrium in which the gears and chimes of
bone and brain worked harmoniously. Robert Ornstein,
a neuropsychologist, calls the brain a "health
maintenance organization," whose purpose is to keep
thriving and balanced all the body's systems. New Age
doctors like Deepak Chopra have gone even further or,
perhaps, been more explicit, stating that the human
animal seeks health at all costs, its entire construction
geared to the maintenance of the robust.


But health, at least in my case, was not so natural,
and despite its allure, I am not totally sold on its goodness
either. My experience with Prozac and the kind of
rushing recovery it spawned has caused me, at the risk
of nostalgia, to look with favor upon the old sanatoriums
and convalescent homes of the late-eighteenth and
early-nineteenth centuries, halfway houses where the
chronically ill, now recovering, hovered in their newfound

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I could have learned to speak that alphabet more
slowly, then maybe my story would have played out differently.
Prozac did not start out for me as a dangerous
drug but over the following months it sometimes
became that way. There was so much I wanted to try. I,
a long-term mental patient in my mid-twenties, had
never been to a rock concert, had, with few exceptions
and great displeasure, rarely left New England, had
never been swimming at Walden Pond, had not in years
eaten a meal without anxiety, taken a walk for no
reason, allowed myself to sleep late, casually dated a
man, or, in short, just played.


The play started out simply enough. I developed an
interest in real estate magazines, especially the freebies
stacked in stands along the streets. <i>Harmon Homes</i>,

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spent hours imagining myself inside the plethora of
houses the world suddenly made available to me. I
started going to open houses. I saw chandeliers sprouting
down through intricate ceiling medallions, old gas
lamps and blue vases on cream-colored windowsills. In
bathrooms I opened the double doors of medicine cabinets
and found evidence of sour stomachs and stress
headaches, everyday pains. I observed kitchens where
foods had been cooked, and, I touched double beds with
pale yellow stains on otherwise perfectly white pillows.
At night I even dreamt of houses, expansive and gorgeous

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the month that followed, I began to range farther and
wider, getting reckless, hungry from all the time I'd
lost to illness. I started going out late at night, prowling
around by myself until two or three in the morning,
standing by the edge of the city river and admiring the
waxy sheen of light on the water or exploring the alleys
of Boston, where broken things glittered. I felt invulnerable.
Propelled by an unquenchable curiosity, I was
a twenty-six-year-old with the judgment of an early
adolescent. I had a special fondness for Faneuil Hall,
where men and food thrived side by side. I floated up
and down the cobblestoned corridors, too nervous to
approach anyone but certainly not too nervous to eat.
I had never before not cared about food, and now I
reveled in my relaxed attitude. I didn't know when to
stop. Although I had not been clinically anorexic in
many years, I had always fretted about my weight. Years
of this had left me alienated from my stomach's signals,
and I was unaware of what it meant to be full. I remember
wandering from stall to stall eating jelly beans
in a sack, and dots--little sugary disks of pale yellow

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And indeed, sometimes in the midst of this newness,
this rampant exploration, my body tanked on sugar and
dough, I wanted to cry. I often, inexplicably, felt this
way while watching the Faneuil Hall magician, a brilliant
performer with straw-blond hair and a black top
hat, with whom I promptly fell in love. This was a magician
who knew his craft, who could make flowers
blossom from silk swatches and birds flock from his fist.
Night after night I watched him, and as the summer
went by his acts got increasingly complex and wonderful
and bizarre, drawing ever larger crowds. One
night when I went to see him he had a female assistant
with him, and he put her in a box. He brandished a

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He had a kitten with him then, this magician, a little
tiger-striped thing that he dangled by the scruff of its
neck and plunged into a tub of water. The crowd gasped
and fell silent. We could see the animal struggling, or,
rather, see his hand holding something frantic down,
and down, and down. I felt myself falling. Two minutes
passed. Then three. Then four. The struggling stopped.
He whooped again, and pulled the same kitten, completely
dry and thrivingly alive, from the bucket of
water. The world, apparently, was full of illusion, and
what was real was not real. I was lost and found, and in
the finding still more lost.


"Now," he said, "for my finest act." He scanned the

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No one volunteered.


"Contrary to all appearances," he said, "I am a loving
man. I won't hurt you. The whole point of my show is
to demonstrate the illusory nature of evil. You see?" He
smiled. He had a charming smile, and some people
popped up their hands, most of them girls with blond
or brown ponytails and perfect summer tans.


"I cannot choose," he said, "from such a small
sample. I need a genuine response, lots of volunteers.
Put up your hands, people. Put up your hands."


"Put up your hands, people, put up your hands," the
assistant called, clapping her own tiny white hands with
painted nails. Some men, now, put up their hands, and
then a field of hands flourished.


The magician looked around. I did not put up my
hand, which is probably why he chose me. Or perhaps
he had seen me standing there, night after night, a
girl/woman on the edge of awkwardness and excitement.
"You," he said to me. "You are the one."


I put my hand to my chest and mouthed <i>me?</i>


"Yes, you," he said. "I can see you have the mystical
sort of temperament this act needs in order to, shall we
say, fly. Come into the center now. Come come."


I went into the center, and he placed a lightbulb in

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I closed my eyes and thought. I held my palm as still
as I could. What was it I wanted? The press of possibilities?
The planets, so many, too many, strewn in the sky?
The openness of new space, new skin, me and not
me, foreign and frightening, lost and found? Where was
I? Who was I? I did not know what I wanted.


I heard a drawn-out "oooh" from the crowd. I felt
something lift from my palm. "And open your eyes," the
magician whispered to me, leaning down close, his lips
at my ear.


I opened my eyes and saw the lightbulb maybe five
feet above me, lit up, a detached and glowing yellow
sphere, a lost and lovely shape hovering. It was a head
without a body, an unmoored mind. "You've done it,"
he said. "She's done it," he shouted, and it was a few
moments before I realized the crowd, that crowd,
clapped for me.


At home, later on that night, I took off my clothes and
looked at myself. My skin had browned from the
summer sun. My eyes were clear as newly washed

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt at home in this body. The curiosities and energies
that had always been rightfully mine were finally
taking their place. This must be what people mean
when they say, "Prozac helped me become the person I
was meant to be."


And yet for me it was not that simple. My personality,
yes, had always consisted of suppressed energies
and curiosities, but also of depressions, echoing intensities,
drivenness that tipped into pain. With the exception
of the counting and touching obsessions, which I
was only too happy to be rid of, I missed these things,
or parts of them anyway, for they were as familiar to
me as dense fog and drizzle, which has its own sort of
lonely beauty, as does a desert or the most mournful of
music.


Looking in the mirror, I touched my bronzed shoulders
and nose with its sunny saddle of freckles. I
thought of die lightbulb, loosed, and when I pictured it,
it was floating still, far from the magician's black bag,
floating over a dark field and then the moving marble of
the Atlantic Ocean, searching for its socket, pulsing and
bright.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the past, I had always recorded images that were
odd or moving to me in my journal. My methods, perhaps,
were a bit odd. When I wrote, it was not from
"me," but from eight people I pictured living inside of
me, eight people who had kept me company for more
years than I can remember. While I knew these people
were not "real," while I could say, "<i>They are figments in
my mind</i>," I still experienced them as flesh, heard them,
felt them--three men who taunted me, three nine-year-olds,
a girl trapped in a glass case, and a blue baby,
sometimes dead, sometimes dying. These eight beings
comprised my core. I knew myself by knowing them--
the blue baby's craving for comfort, the glassed-in girl's
high-pitched anxiety, her desire for freedom clashing
with her need for the airless perfection of a crystal
world.


Blue Baby was the one who usually had the most
interesting things to say to me. When it spoke, I went
into a light trance, my pen moving as if of its own
accord, and when it was finished speaking, I felt as
though I'd visited a place too intense to be anything but
real. Here is an example, something Blue Baby wrote
to me years before I started Prozac.


<i>Mother of many<br />
Watch your children play</i>

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The water takes us in and as we sink<br />
Our snowsuits shine beneath the lake's<br />
Ice lens. We cry from below<br />
Bubbles rise and in the woods creeks weep<br />
Go on, get down on your knees, look for<br />
A buckle or a bit of mitten. Ear to the ground<br />
Can't you hear our whispers and waterlogged dreams?<br />
At night we call you<br />
Does it comfort you to think that death came gracefully<br />
That we danced our way down?</i>


<i>All that winter we skated figure eights<br />
Against a sky so blue<br />
It should have been an omen<br />
So when the ice opened to admit us<br />
Shouldn't you have heard it crack?<br />
Don't let yourself imagine how the fish must nibble<br />
How our dresses fill and float</i>


<i>Go on, float to us<br />
Quiet in the hallway. Slipperless</i>

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now, back in my apartment, I picked up my pen and
opened my journal. I closed my eyes, bent over the
page, and waited. I said yes to myself, which in the past
had been the signal for Blue Baby to emerge and speak
with me. Now I heard silence.


<i>Yes. Hello</i>.


Nothing.


<i>Yes, hello</i>.


Maybe a slight stir, a quickening that faded fast.


I kept my eyes closed. And then I could see them all
down there, Blue Baby curled, the girl in the glass case
biting at her nails. And then I could hear them down
there, snatches of sentences I transcribed on paper, but
the words felt dull, dead. A bright layer separated me
from them, and as I sensed correctly at the time, the
barrier would remain as a perpetual part of my Prozac

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I finally fell into a troubled sleep, and I woke with
fear. Monday morning. Writing had always been essential
to me, not the academic stuff of school, but the
looser and loftier stuff of stories and poems. I called the
Prozac Doctor.


"I feel weird," I said.


"Weird," he repeated. "Like how?"


I paused, struggling to find the words. "I'm
worried."


"Of course you're worried," he said. "You're an
obsessive. Obsessives worry."


"No," I said. "I'm not obsessively worrying. I'm worrying
unobsessively about the medication. Do you think
it can take away your creativity?"


"There have been no studies on that question," the
Prozac Doctor said. "But I doubt it. I certainly wouldn't
worry about it."


"I don't feel like me," I said. "I mean, I feel more like
me in some ways and less like me in others. I'm scared.
I'm really worried," I said, my voice rising with the
memory of silence, company I could not reach.


"I hear that," he said. "Your worry indicates the presence

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He told me to take two capsules a day instead of one,
which, at first, I didn't do. In fact, I was thinking of
stopping the Prozac altogether, torn between my desire
for my old self and my enthusiasm for the new. I was
concerned that Prozac, and the health it spawned,
could take away not only my creativity but my very
identity. And the answer to that--although there had
been "no studies"--was a certain yes. I was a different
person now, both more and less like me, fulfilling one
possibility while swerving from another. There is loss in
that swerving. And my experience on Prozac showed
me how few there are who understand that loss or are
prepared for its expression.


The work of the psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman
focuses on the subjective meanings of illness. He calls
illness, or suffering, a narrative, which, at its best, concatenates
a coherent story of self. Symptoms and pain
take on value as they become symbols referring to
something larger than themselves. The cancer patient
must make of her pain <i>this</i> or <i>that</i>. The schizophrenic
sees his pain, perhaps, as stories sent by gods and
devils, and as such the stories are rich in reverberations.
Illness, according to Kleinman, is more than a set

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Having lived with chronic depression, a high-pitched
panic, and a host of other psychiatric symptoms since my
earliest years, I had made for myself an illness identity, a
story of self that had illness as its main motive. I did not
sleep well because I was ill. I cut myself because I was ill.
Illness, for me, had been the explanatory model on
which my being was based. Since I had spent much time
in mental hospitals, illness had also been something I'd
learned, like a skill, like spelling. From Rosie and Katie I
had acquired ever new and niftier ways of cutting
myself, admiring the ruby zippers that tracked these
girls' arms. From Ann I'd learned anxiety's different
positions and sounds, its jagged breaths and sweat. I
knew medication's spectrum, colored liquid Thorazine,
the melted sky of Stelazine, lavender Halcions and Ativans
scattered like snowflakes on a steel tray. Illness was
language as well as color; I knew a secret special language
with words like <i>sharps</i> and <i>checks</i> and <i>rounds</i>, and
then the longer, arcane phrases and words that every
patient picks up--<i>trichotillomania</i> and <i>waxy flexibility,
Munchausen's</i> and <i>borderlines</i>--the most mysterious
word of all, suggesting the line of the horizon, a flat
world, a ship tipping over into star-filled night.

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And now, gone. I had tipped over, stepped over the
border into health. There was no more depression,
which had felt like the stifling yet oddly comforting
weight of a woolen blanket, or anxiety, which lent a
certain fluorescence to things, or voices, which had
always been there, sometimes louder, sometimes
softer, some North Star of sound in the night.


A few days later I had my first follow-up appointment
with the Prozac Doctor. His office was just as I remembered
it, large, gracious, a plush rug on the floor. Added
to his Prozac paraphernalia was a three-dimensional
model of a plastic synapse showing how the drug
worked. The synapse, which looked like one of those
Krazy Straws, all looped and bent, was bright pink, and
its tip ended in a dish, labeled the synaptic cleft, where
turquoise liquid, simulating serotonin, pooled. He
demonstrated for me. By pushing a button on the right,
he made the synapse twitch, sucking up the serotonin
at a brisk clip. "The obsessive brain," he said, nodding
toward me. When he pushed the button on the left,
however, the synapse slowed down its sucking, allowing
the serotonin to remain lapping in its gap.


"By allowing the serotonin to remain for longer
periods of time in the synaptic cleft," he said, "Prozac

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But what else does it diminish or eradicate?" I
asked.


"You are still worried," he said to me, trying to act
like a therapist, which was not at all in his nature. Still,
I appreciated the effort.


"Yes," I said. I was too embarrassed to tell him about
the eight people in me. "I'm still feeling ... off. Off in
a good way, I think, but--"


"Symptoms," the Prozac Doctor said to me. "Let's
review your anxiety symptoms. Obsessive thoughts?"


"Very few," I said.


"Would you say a sixty percent reduction?"


"Eighty, ninety, maybe even ninety-five."


"Excellent," the Prozac Doctor said. "A marvelous
response. Depression?"


"Absolutely none," I said. "Except--"


"Except what? Are you sleeping well?"


"Yes."


"Concentration?"


"I can read faster than I could before, and my
thinking's clear."


"Eating?"


"A lot," I said.


At this he looked concerned. He sat back in his chair

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No," I said. "I'm not binging. It's not compulsive.
I'm just not so afraid of getting fat. I don't think I will
get fat, even though I guess I've gained. I'm just sampling
a lot of foods I never allowed myself to try
before."


"Purging?" he said, looking straight at me.


I shook my head no.


"Well," he said, steepling his fingertips and staring
up at the ceiling. "It seems Prozac has made you almost
completely symptom-free. You have had a beautiful
response to it. Consider yourself lucky."


I left. I stepped outside his office and onto the grounds
of McLean, a large hospital where I felt, not surprisingly,
at ease. In the distance a white-haired woman
drifted across the tended lawn. Two doctors wheeled a
machine into a small door on the side of a brick
building. When I looked up, I could see the windows of
the wards, the cool shadows of people moving in a
sealed and special world.


I slipped into the hospital's medical library, where,
supposedly, only doctors and nurses were allowed to
go. The woman at the front desk, busy writing something,
didn't see me, and before she looked up, I

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now I looked up at the titles of the books. My eyes
burned, and when I looked down I imagined a child
standing before me, her hair white-blond, her expression
serious. She seemed to stand in her own circle of
sun. She seemed to want something from me, maybe a
book out of reach, an answer to a question. She was a
child, I knew, real and not real, an intimate expression
of my faded insides, which she took with her when she
left, dazzling and dissolving into the high ceiling, the
vaulted ceiling of some new house, where loons and
peacocks called.


Prozac, at least in my case, did not eliminate worry;
rather, it shortened its life span so my bouts of fretting
over the drug were rather rapidly replaced by longer
bouts of cheer. And confidence. In the weeks that followed
I learned to drink lattes while reading Rabelais. I
made some friends at an outdoor café--Molly, Caraway,
Pamela. Readers of <i>The Nation</i> and scoffers at
<i>Newsweek</i>, they took me with them to Harvard Yard,

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I started to send to schools a resume I had written--
I thought I might like to try teaching--on which I
claimed phantom jobs in distant states as a humanities
researcher, a teen-suicide counselor, and finally an
English instructor at a private academy, where I pictured
frail dogwoods growing by a black lacy fence. The
résumé remains, to date, one of my finest pieces of fiction.
Only days after having sent it out, I got several
requests for interviews and, not long after that, an
actual job offer at a literacy center. I am proud and
ashamed of that résumé, for it shows the kind of drunk
doggedness you sometimes need in order to thrive in a
competitive world. I had it printed on ivory paper, a
weave thick enough to soak up the stains of deceit.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then one evening, shortly before accepting my
new job offer, I dressed for my first concert ever. An
old high school buddy had gotten us tickets to see
Michelle Shocked. I had been on the medication, altogether,
for not more than two months. I put on black
leggings and a black tunic and a choker of red around
my neck, and although I intended this costume to
express my adventurousness, now I see it also as a sign
of what I felt inside, the choker shining like a slash on
my neck.


Now that I was a Prozac person, I owned a good bit
of makeup, which I had bought at the CVS, standing by
mirrors and furtively applying cherry balm and frosty
pink. That evening I wore my makeup too, and I slung
an army knapsack over my shoulder.


I had never seen such a crowd in love, and it moved
me even further beyond myself, up and out. When
Michelle Shocked came onto the stage, thousands
surged forward, flicking lighters in the air. All around
me, bodies moved, and I had to move too, because I
was a part of something larger. Michelle crooned out
ballads about ice and red clay roads, about high skies
and dead friends, and I trembled. The man next to me
trembled. He took my hand and had me move left, now
right, now out of the aisle and up close to the stage, the
music pouring. And then it was over.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"My name," he said, speaking into the sudden
silence, his accent Israeli, "is Yehuda."


"Yehuda," I thought, swooning stupidly. Joshua, the
name of the biblical boy who fought the lions, the
heroic man who overcame evil. Such a man could not
hurt me. Such a man could only help me. And he was
handsome to boot, dark eyes, dark curly hair, broad in
all the right ways.


"Lauren," I said, looking down at the floor.


He was very forward, that Yehuda. He put his hand
right under my chin and tipped it up, so I was staring
straight into his oh-so-sincere eyes. "I am new to this
country," he said. "Visiting for a few weeks. I am planning
to move here next year. Will you show me
around?"


"Yes," I said. <i>Moving here</i>, I thought. <i>Handsome</i>, I
thought. <i>Jewish</i>, I thought.


He pulled a bandanna out of his baggy pants and
wiped his forehead. Saturday night, muggy, not too
late. "I would like to go swimming," he said. "I have
heard there are some very good swimming places, not
too far."


My friend, at this point, had found me in the crowd.
"Time to go," she said.


"I'll call you later," I said to her. "This is Yehuda.
We're going swimming."

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She narrowed her eyes and looked at me. "Swimming,
huh?" She bent close to me. "You're sure that's
what you want?"


Yehuda was staring at us. She looked from him to
me. "Swimming, huh?" she said again, her voice full of
portent. "Aren't you just getting over strep?"


"I'm fine," I said. And, indeed, I did feel fine, quite
confident all would be well. I pulled her aside. "He's
actually a friend. An old cousin of mine," I lied. "It's
amazing we met here, family from Israel."


"Yehuda is your cousin," she repeated. "What other
cousins do you have, maybe some from Afghanistan,
Egypt, Africa? A real international family."


I had a brief image, then, of the eight people inside
me, north of my neck, south of my stomach, a muffled
population, a distant planet.


"He's the only cousin I have," I said, and for a second
I believed it.


Cousin Yehuda had a nice little rental car, a spiffy red
thing with a convertible top. He was very polite, ushering
me out of the concert hall ahead of him, suavely
opening doors and taking my elbow to cross the street.
As soon as we had buckled into his vehicle, though, he
announced that the night air had cooled him, and he no

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Boston's famous deer park?" I repeated. I'd lived in
Boston all my life and had never heard of such a thing.


He put the tour book in my lap, and sure enough,
there it was, in a close-by suburb, open round the
clock, in all seasons, described in lush and loving terms,
acres of trees, fawns springing over moss while the city
skyline glowed in the distance.


"OK," I said, basically agreeing to drive into a forest
with a strange six-foot man, one of my dumber decisions,
informed by the off-kilteredness that was health
to me.


We arrived there in less than twenty minutes. Evergreens
spiked into the air. Through the dense darkness I
could see the hovering shapes of the trees, their roots
breaking the earth like the tendons showing through
skin. Something moist and furry brushed my knee.
Insects rose from rotting logs. He held my hand, this
Joshua who beat the beasts, this king and cousin, he
took my hand and led me into the wild.


My heart was paddling, half from fear, half from excitement.
This was life, yes. Here I was, yes. Something

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My eyes adjusting to the darkness, I could see better
now. I could see bats soaring beneath the trees. I could
see the craggy cliff that was this man's face, jutting
nose, rocky chin, the steep slopes of his Sephardic
cheeks. I didn't think he would hurt me. After all, he
came from Israel, and as he'd told me while we stood
on the concert floor, he'd been in the army. To a Jewish
girl raised by fiercely Zionist parents, that fact
made it all seem safe. He was one of the men I'd
watched on television as a child. He had rescued the
athletes at Munich; he had personally guarded the
Golan Heights, folding victims of terrorist attacks into
his warm bulk.


And, like all army men, he was more a doer than a
talker. As soon as we reached a clearing, he didn't waste
much time swooping me into his arms like I was a
victim myself, laying me down on the forest floor,
where the worms were.


"Wait a minute," I said, pushing him off me.


"OK," he said, sitting up. I guess he took me quite
literally. He peered at his watch, and after what seemed
like precisely a minute had gone by, he descended

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No. No. Wait a minute," I said, and this time I scuttled
away from him.


"OK," he said in the same good-natured voice. He
held up his hands in a protest of innocence and then
casually slung one arm around my shoulder. We sat in
silence. I could feel the forest encroaching from all
sides, the breaths of a million beasts, insects working
the earth, dragging and devouring.


I shuddered, and Yehuda pulled me closer, a gesture
both threatening and comforting, locking me in. "The
moon," he said softly, looking up through the trees, "is
complete."


Indeed, it was a full moon, large and a little sickly-looking.
I myself felt a bit sick now, like I might be getting
that strep my friend had mentioned.


"I have a sore throat," I announced, a comment that
makes such perfect sense, for illness had always been
both my escape and my means of seduction, the heat
between my mother and me.


The Israeli, as though on cue, turned to me. He
looked straight at me, his pupils deep as inkwells.
As though he had known me forever, he started to
stroke my throat, up and down, up and down, long

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think he could sense my fear. He made love to me
like I was a virgin, very delicately. The whole time I felt
there and not there. I felt waves of fear and pleasure.
My body responded, rising to his touch. However, my
mind felt detached, and while there was warmth there
was also ice, wedging up between us, within me. I had
little experience with sex. My one long-term relationship
in college had coincided with my most severe
period of anorexia. The last time I'd made love I'd
weighed ninety pounds, a woman without a period, a
woman all bone and brain, no flesh. This flesh was new
to me. Deep in my body, eggs ripened and dropped.
Snakes slid on the ground. I imagined deer came forward,
hundreds of them, thousands of them watching
us with wet and ghostly eyes. Something moaned.
Inside me an organ I'd never felt before reddened and
stretched. This was new. Pleasure was new. He was
new. I was making love not to one stranger but to two.


He dropped me off in front of my apartment building,
and only once I was inside did I realize I was shaking.

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The image of deer kept coming back to me. We
hadn't seen any, but I had felt them, their hot breath
and rocking canters, their antlers, covered with fuzz.


And when I peeled off my clothes, I saw scat on the
back of them, and three hairs from the finest hide.


Three days passed, my breasts filled, and still my period
didn't come. I pressed at my stomach, and whenever
liquid slid from me, I rushed to the bathroom to peer.
Nothing.


But inside, everything. Inside, things puffed and
leaked and ripened in lumps. I felt a little fish swimming,
a speckled tadpole turning, and turning again.


Terror. I remembered Yehuda, only now without
complexity. Now he was purely bad, a man immersed
in bloodied bodies, a man with weapons he'd let loose
in me, this baby a blade. As for sex, well, sex was sweet
but clearly dangerous, and you could lose yourself in it,
if you had not already lost yourself outside of it,
sucking down Prozac, those plump little green-and-cream-colored
spheres.


I let a week go by, and then I took myself to a
women's health clinic in Brookline. I was so convinced I

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a small room with potholders on stirrups and a
poster of Monet's water lilies on the ceiling, which
women were meant to stare at while doctors did things
to them, I got my blood taken. Then they put my blood
into a little blender and whipped it up. I kept having to
run to the bathroom, I was so nervous. AIDS had not
even crossed my mind, only pregnancy. I figured Israelis
didn't have AIDS.


"OK," the nurse said, motioning me from the
waiting room, where they had sent me while the test
was brewing. I tipped back into the examining room.


"Negative," the doctor said.


Bliss. I loved the Israeli all over again. And what fun
that night now seemed, with all those deer.


"I need some birth control," I said to him. "I need a
diaphragm." Actually, I wasn't planning to sleep with
anybody. The Israeli had gone back home and was
probably right now flying in a jet over the desert. But
still. Just in case.


"Let's get you fitted," he said. I liked the idea of a
diaphragm. I pictured its small rubber cap snapped over
my cervix, containing me, covering me while I exposed
my skin.

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctor, who was Russian and who was wearing a
name tag that said BORIS YAZLOVIAN, put on his gloves
and then checked me. His fingers in me hurt a bit, that
organ reddening and stretching. I winced.


"Hmmm," he said. "Is there pain?"


"Yes," I said. "A little."


I was familiar with that particular pain. Anytime I'd
had intercourse, there had always been a sting and
stretch if the man moved in a certain way. I hadn't
thought to check it out, just figured it was one of my
womanly perks, like a period. After all, I'd never totally
reconciled myself to the idea of someone sticking
something inside of me, in my rawest part. Of course,
along with pleasure, it should hurt a little.


The doctor lowered his head between my legs, and
then there was more pain. "Excuse me," I said.


He bobbed back up. His face was flushed, a man who
had just made a mighty discovery. "You," he said in his
thick Russian accent, "you are still a virgin."


"Am not," I said, sounding like an eighth-grader. I
was offended. After all, since I'd been on Prozac, I was a
woman of the world. Lightbulbs lifted from me, men
entered me, I rode on the ridged backs of stags.


"Yes, you are," he repeated. "Even though you are a
sexually active twenty-six-year-old, you are still, medically
speaking, a virgin."

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then he explained to me how I had an unusual
hymen, O-shaped and intact, very stretched but not
quite clipped. A tough little hymen, he said, a stubborn,
grisly circle of skin that would bend but not break, and
that was responsible for the occasional pain.


"We should take care of it" he said, and I swear I saw
a glint in his eye. "It's a simple medical procedure. A
local anesthetic, snip, and the end."


But I was perfectly fine with my hymen the way it
was.


"Oh, no," he said. "It's not normal."


I pictured my hymen, a red wedge within me, something,
through all my Prozac adventures, that had stayed
the same, sealed and safe. Deep in my vagina I had my
own little locked hospital room.


"We should cut it open," he said. "It's not feasible for
childbirth, and continued pain during intercourse
could cause ..." He paused.


"Could cause what?" I said.


"Psychological difficulties," he said, lowering his
voice. "You are a healthy young woman. No need to
take a risk like that."


I smiled to myself. "We wouldn't want psychological
difficulties," I said to him. I pictured him cutting, the
door opening, Blue Baby, Glassed-In Girl tumbling out
of me, birthed from me, severed and separate.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"In five minutes it will be over," he said, calling in a
nurse, not waiting for me to acquiesce. In the name of
health, I let him lead. A shot of Novocain, and my
insides hummed and numbed. The scissors were tiny,
like cuticle clippers. I felt not a thing. I heard a crisp
<i>snap</i>. In that moment the last cords to my old self, my
sick self, were cut. I thought of the pictures I'd seen as a
child, astronauts floating around a foreign moon, all
space silent.


I started to cry. At first I cried lightly, so the nurse
and doctor did not notice. As they wheeled me down
the hall, though, I started to cry harder, as though there
had been a hymen in my throat as well and now that it
was gone the grief of health rose up and ran out.


The corridor was narrow. White lights burned
above. We passed what must have been a vacuum aspirator
machine, and it was full of fresh contents, glinting
and salty. Blue Baby.


I closed my eyes. I put my hands over my emptied
stomach. The Novocain was wearing off now, and my
birth canal buzzed, like there was a bee caught in there,
like you sometimes find a bee in an abandoned room,
buzzing and buzzing amid the dusty furniture.


The nurses in the recovery room, where I was
placed, were so kind. The room was full of women in
various stages of anesthesia, and all of them, I think,

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353306-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I kept crying, freely now, having finally arrived at a
place made just for grief. I thought of the hospital, a
nurse named Iris, the luscious look of red medicine in
a plastic cup, the grayness of depression, the edge of
anxiety, both of which had given me my voice, the
people I'd lost, all cords cut. "It's OK, dear," a nurse
said to me, coming over to stroke my hair. I'm sure she
thought I was recovering from an abortion, and in a
way she was right. Girl gone. Blue Baby gone. "It will
all seem better soon," she said. "We won't have you
leave until you're ready."


<i>Until I was ready</i>. No one, in my Prozac career, had
yet said that to me. I had arrived at my convalescent
home, this brief respite in a recovery room. I lay back
in the seat. I let her hand smooth my brow. She had pale
lipstick on, and she had beautiful skin. The sun coming
in through the window sifted through her hair, making
the blondness glow gold. Maybe, this mother, she
would read me a story. Maybe she would bring me
tea and toast. Maybe she would stay until the heat
passed, and then--I could see it--she would help me
stand. And she would walk me forward, a bit like a
