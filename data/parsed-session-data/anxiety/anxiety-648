—SIGMUND FREUD, "MOURNING AND MELANCHOLIA"


<b>I TELL EMILY WE'RE OVER THE DAY BEFORE
VANESSA MOVES BACK IN</b>.


I cry into the carpet until it leaves burn marks on my forehead. I
hold on to the floor like it's moving, like I might fall through it. A load-bearing
structure in my psyche has collapsed and I have no idea why. I
feel desperate. Something has come unhinged inside me. I walk gingerly
in the grocery store, leaning on the cart for support. I drive myself to the
chiropractor's office, to the gym, to the bar. I push thumbtacks through
a note in the center of my bulletin board where I have carefully printed
my new emotional policy.


<b>NO WISTFULNESS</b>. But I am wistful.

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WISTFULNESS sounds like a wilted emotion, a bit of lavender pressed
between the pages of a well-tempered personality. At worst the SHRINKING
VIOLET a wet spot where words bleed through. But wistfulness
is no wallflower. She is the quiet psychosis of still waters. She twists raw
fingers in her hair. She leaps high in the air with harm in one hand and
reward in the other and no grip left for nightmares.


She is a BAD SEED. She sleeps naked. She rides bareback.


Neuropsychiatry calls this recklessness a fatal flaw.


GO FASTER. SCARE ME.


Ann Marlowe was a high-functioning heroin addict. In her memoir
of addiction she describes the drug as a way to stop time. She calls
the high "a stand-in, a stop-gap, a mask, for what we believe is missing."
Addiction is the kissing cousin of nostalgia. They pass for sisters
in a certain light. Each time the addict uses, she gestures backwards to
the perfect unrecoverable past, reaching for something she can never
have again. "The chemistry of the drug is ruthless: it is designed to
disappoint you," Marlowe says. Likewise, cultural anthropologists say
the biochemistry of love is addictive. When a person becomes infatuated,
her body floods with chemicals that stimulate the brain with a

"Barriers also seem to provoke this madness," she writes. "THE
CHASE." Affairs with unavailable people are a heroin high before nausea
hits. Like smack they are destined to disappoint.


They begin with magic. <i>Then the chasing after magic</i>.


And finally the MOURNING FOR MAGIC.


I MAKE A BEELINE for the west coast. I think about Emily and Vanessa
locked in a glowing embrace and I want to be very far away. I visit
my friend Lila in Los Angeles. We go on adventures. We find treasures. I
tell Lila I want a girlfriend like her with a clavicle you could drown in. I
put my arm around her as we look out at the ocean. I look at the endless
green sea and choose grief over dread. I kiss Lila on the lips. We bar hop
a bit, then stop the car somewhere in West Hollywood and have sex in
the front seat. As she puts her tiny car in drive again and pulls away from
the curb, I watch the traffic lights blink yellow through Lila's toe prints
like daisy petals on the windshield.


I want to forget Emily. I want to be over her.

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My life has been reduced to a frantic effort to hold Emily
HOSTAGE-CLOSE.


I have thought of ending the affair only in terms of loss. The embarrassment
of a ribbon printed in gold with the title RUNNER-UP.
I am haunted by the idea that QUITTERS NEVER win and WINNERS NEVER
QUIT. I consider the maniac pace of emailing and texting and calling,
the unrelenting focus of seduction and rivalry. And for an instant, I
glimpse it—not what stopping takes away but what stopping could
provide—the deep pool calm of a quiet mind. I miss the stillness of
long unworried reflection.


I want it back almost as much as I want Emily.


"I knew you'd sleep with her," Emily says when she picks me up at
the airport. She would never charge me with betrayal. She knows she has
no right. Still I am anxious in the light of her disapproval. Whether it's
fair or not. Whether it's there or not. I am on the hot seat and the truth
is I'm glad for the heat.


She cares. This still matters to me.


Why does obsession open like a blister on my face?


What makes the difference between THRIVING and FAILING TO THRIVE?

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One girl scars from cigarette burns on her back, her arm broken
in the shape of her mother's ruthless grip. Her face is a calm ocean and
she never even looks at the faded pink moons of tissue along her scapula.
Another girl is cut in half by a sharp look. When she loses her head she
points fingers instead of picking it up. One person places love like a stone
at each corner of her lover's body. Another trails it in the wisp and blur of
white lies. It dribbles from her lips and fingertips. It garbles her words.


<i>Why do I want her?</i>


The genes of two alcoholic grandfathers and two addict parents
flooded the sac of amniotic fluid that held me nine months inside
my mother's body. The acid of self-sabotage braised my fetus limbs.
I fermented. I squirmed from my mother's birth canal already high
and screaming for comfort. My attachment bonds fit in the hand
like a small glass pipe—hot to the lips and easy to hide—a hand-blown
one-hitter with scarlet ribbons wriggling down the center. <i>If I
get stoned and sing all night long,</i> well, no one could say they didn't
see it coming.

I spent my early childhood in a state of chronic anxiety. I wrote
love notes to each parent and from the time I could put words to paper I
packaged my affection with uncertainty.


I love you Linda. I like you. Do you love me Do you like<br />
me Linda Yes I no you do Linda. I love you Linda and<br />
Marty I Like You Do you love me Do you like me Yes I<br />
no you do Linda and Marty. Happy Mother's Day I love<br />
you mom [and do you love me]


Questions itched in hard to reach places.


Children with insecure attachment styles are bad to chase the
dragon. We become addicted to our own adrenaline and we always go
back for more—no matter how dangerous the dose or how blue the
comedown. The memory of intense psychological arousal <i>I love you do
you love me</i> leaves us with a craving for powerful jolts.

A new crush texts. A co-worker loops a pinky finger over yours.
The perfect fit as opiate and tourniquet.


<b>A GAL COULD GET HOOKED ON THIS FEELING</b>.


IN THE STEAMING HEAT of June we are fast storms and loud
thunderclaps. We cannot give each other more than a day or two of
peace at a time. We call and say mean things <i>I thought you loved me! You
don't even know what the word means!</i> and hang up on each other like
thirteen-year-olds.


I want Emily to acknowledge the choice she has made. She says
I am the one making the choice by insisting we are ALL or NOTHING.
I wedge words like SIGNIFICANT OTHER and PRIMARY PARTNER between
her lips but she spits them out unformed in my face. We are hot and
cold. We cross paths on purpose. We generate reasons to test the water
but we are looking for different things. She checks the gauge for FRIENDS
or LOVERS. I read the meter for LOVERS or ENEMIES.


Vanessa leaves town again for six weeks midsummer.


Emily finds a house for me to buy in her neighborhood. I move in.

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For six weeks we suspend all rules of morality and let ourselves revel
in wanton behaviors. We take hot showers together and drink bourbon
together and lie in the wet grass kissing each other while spiders bite our
thighs and backs. Her teenage daughter peers into the dark yard and
dials her other mother's number to tell her it's still going on.


We give in to whatever this is. We want more. We are speed freaks
who want to keep going. <i>It doesn't even feel good</i>. The dope used to be the
means to a euphoric end. Now THE POINT OF THE DOPE IS THE DOPE.

—STANTON PEELE, "Fools for Love: The Romantic Ideal,<br />
Psychological Theory and Addictive Love"


Emily halfway agrees to rid herself of Vanessa to make room for
our growing addiction. I halfway pretend to believe her.


The lie we collude in is NOT YET.


We will be together but NOT YET.


We will be together but FIRST THIS.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The relationship with Vanessa must be brought gradually to an
end. Emily needs time for a graceful goodbye. I look at the academic
calendar and count nine months between this NOT YET and the supposed
eventual YES.


I USED TO BELIEVE people who ran out of rooms before bursting
into tears were being intentionally melodramatic. Now I become one
of those people. I am so brittle I feel like I might break into pieces if
someone looks too hard in my direction. I am holding on to sanity like
a window ledge I fell out of. I become obsessed with Emily's sleeping
arrangements. I ask questions, wanting clarity about something. The
questions pry my fingers one by one from the ledge.


<i>"Do you still sleep in the same bed?"</i>


<i>"Do you spoon with her?"</i>


<i>"Do you ever, in a dreamy lazy early morning sleep,
sling your leg over her body? Or let her sling a leg over yours?"</i>

Psychologists call it PERSEVERATION.


I Call it EMOTIONAL SELF-CUTTING.


Searching out a painful image, going over it and over it in my
mind, raking its sharp edges over my open psychological sores. My mind
generates the million and one questions I ask in order to avoid asking the
only one that matters. <i>Can you save me?</i>


At the time I believe my thoughts are real.


I believe I'm solving something.


ONE RESPONSE TO FEELING ABANDONED<br />
IS TO ABANDON YOURSELF.<br />
—Theodore Millon, <i>Personality Disorders in Modern Life</i>


I stop eating.


I am experimenting with deprivation as a way of protesting Emily's
intermittent availability. I think of it at the time as an act of sadness
but I will later realize the truth about eating disorders and cutting
and alcoholism and the logic that structures every form of self-injury.
Living in a house without heat is a sustained act of hostility. Not eating
is a test of endurance. I can go without so many things. This wilderness
skill keeps me safe. I short-circuit my needs and defuse other people's
power over me.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I want to defy trauma.


I picture myself monstrous and strange, like the day I climbed
from the broken window of a wrecked car in shock, bleeding from my
torn cheek and coughing up glass on the sparkling asphalt.


When I feel hunger signs again—a headache, nausea—I let anxiety
push it away.


I open the refrigerator, then close it. Late evening I give in, pour a
bowl of cereal or steam a serving of broccoli. I don't want flavor or a full
stomach. I want someone to take care of me. Someone should be paying
closer attention.


I'm not okay.


The goal of maintaining mental wellness really can be measured in
units of OKAYNESS. When I'M OKAY and YOU'RE OKAY, everyone is in her
right mind and life can be met as a manageable challenge. Two adults
communicate clearly with each other and observe appropriate roles and
boundaries. These are complementary transactions.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Problems crop up when the wires get crossed. Two adults speak to
each other but one adopts the prescriptive voice of a parent rather than a
peer. If the other one follows suit and responds in the helpless voice of a
child, the OKAYNESS of the room loses balance. Crossed transactions hook
the ego state of the child buried inside the adult. Next thing you know, the
adultchild sits in a cold room dripping tears on an empty table.


THE PERSON WHOSE NOT OK CHILD IS<br />
ALWAYS ACTIVATED CANNOT GET ON<br />

—THOMAS HARRIS, <i>I'm Okay, You're Okay</i>


Emily drops by one evening and finds me crying in the kitchen.


"It's cold in here."


I am wearing a long sleeved T-shirt, a thin silk cardigan, a wool
cardigan, and a fleece jacket zipped up beneath my chin.


"I know," I say.

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She tells me to get in the car. She has something to show me.
She rides me around a nearby neighborhood, takes me on a tour of
the Christmas lights, shows me yards in the lower middle class area
a few blocks from my house filled with enormous sleighs, reindeer,
and snowmen, all lit up, with moving parts and sound effects. Santa
waves, lithium lidded, as we pass by. I look out the window of the car
and cry harder. The blue and green and red and white blur and grow
faint as we turn the corner back on to the highway. I hate this scene of
manufactured sentimentality. I want her to stop handing me postcards
and platitudes.


In my kitchen again, Emily says, "What can I do? Why aren't you
happy? You should be enjoying your wonderful house, your solitude.
What I would give for your solitude. I wish I lived here." I look at Emily,
my chest tight with resentment towards families and holiday lights and
joy. I am outside the magic circle.


"So do I."


I'm not sure if I mean I wish she lived here or I wished I lived here.


"Seriously, what's wrong?"


"I'm lonely."


I am regressing. Refusing to do for myself.

That night Emily turns the heat on and leaves a box of Italian
chocolates at my house. I unwrap one after she goes home, breaking my
hunger strike with one decadent bite, and as I savor the rich dark flavor
I read the quotation on the wax paper inside. It is from the eighteenth
century French philosopher Denis Diderot.


<i>There is only one passion, the passion for happiness</i>.


Emily brings food over in plastic containers the next day. I scoop
warm couscous into my mouth after she leaves. I want food only if it
comes from her hand. I want warmth only if she sets the thermostat herself.
I have chosen to respond as the child and my playful reenactment
quickly hardens into habit. I forget how to respond adult-to-adult.


MY NOT-OKAY child is a beanstalk. She grows like corn in the night.
She pokes her pink sausage wonderland arms out the windows of my
little house.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

ONE NIGHT I WAKE from a bad dream and call Emily moaning
<i>I need you</i> into the phone like an accusation. I want her to make an honest
woman of me. She says she doesn't know what I mean.


"I love you—can't you see that?" and her meaningless words tap
inarticulate as rain on tin. I stop speaking and make the low mournful
noises of a dog left outside in a thunderstorm.


"There's nothing anyone can do," I say. I press the edges of my teeth
into the bony curve of my kneecap. Emily drives to my house and crawls
into bed to lick my wounds. I rock and pant and spit glass at her feet.


Thin wet dogs come to me in my dreams.


I don't know how to help them.


<i>"You are driving me crazy,"</i> I wail. <i>"Why don't you care?"</i> The
last word—<b>CARE</b>—loses elasticity and flattens into another long wail.
I am knees on the floor, shoulders on the floor, forehead on the floor. It
is the fetal position. I get caught in a loop of feelings. I get louder and
louder. I am groping about for the concept of NEGLECT. She is neglecting
me. But I can't find the words. I can't catch my breath.


"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO," she says.

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This time she does not come to me so I break up with Emily (again).
This time when she tells me it's killing her I don't respond in my usual
way. I tell her I can't help her. I tell her to try therapy.


I need therapy too.


Other people would confidently end such a relationship based on
the obvious logic of infidelity—if she cannot be TRUE BLUE to her partner,
she will not be TRUE BLUE to you—but I resist this logic. I moon and
sob and swear to god Emily's simply amazing. I sulk and whine.


I want THE AMAZING EMILY for my own.


"THIS PART SHOULD be over by now," Paula says, "but you are frozen
in the infatuation stage because you cannot move forward in the
normal way in this relationship." She watches my face for cracks but
I'm sealed tight. "You should be having the power struggle by now. You
should be seeing each other as real people by now. But you're not. No
wonder you're confused and exhausted. She remains the sought-after
illusion for you. None of this is real."


I won't concede the point. I insist it's real. I think Paula can't help
me because Paula doesn't get our passion. I don't even really want her to.
I just want her to supervise my withdrawal from the drug.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm not going to tell you not to see her," Paula said. "That's not my
job. That's not what I'm here for." I walk across the hot asphalt to my car,
slam the door, and turn the music up too loud. Soon I am running my
hands over Emily's body in remote corners of empty parking lots.


I'M A BEAST...<br />
I GO MAD...


All I want from therapy is a boost out of my enmeshed state. Not
big picture therapeutic work. A BAND-AID, a BLOW-POP, and an UPBEAT
PROGNOSIS. When I don't get a quick fix I drop out.


The Child wants immediate results:<br />
Instant coffee.<br />

Immediate relief.


Emily and I are stuck in this ambivalent embrace. We don't want
to go forward or backward. We just want to stay here like this. We want
to die like this. Sometimes I turn on her with vicious accusations. You
come to my house and fill your mouth with figs. <i>You use me to satisfy
your pleasures, then send me to bed without supper</i>. Sometimes I offer
her everything I have. Time. Money. My kidney. I tell her I want to live
together and parent her child like a real couple.


Somehow she knows none of this is true. I don't.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I believe whatever I say, whatever I decide, can be true if I try
hard enough.


And I vow to make it all true.


THE ADDICT, OF COURSE, CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

<i>I join a long history of lady-loving-ladies feasting on rare pears of
fantasy</i>. We reenact <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> as if torture came like a toaster
with our jacket for members only. We are lesbians who languish. Emily
plays Angela. I play Stephen.

Stephen conceived of a loyalty far beyond<br />

I think she would be with me if she could. I think she's stuck.


I yell down into the tight space where she's wedged, <i>Hold on, I'm
coming!</i> I lie down by the edge of the well and talk gently in the voice
of a dreamer.


I try to put her in a trance.


<i>Because we love each other so deeply. Because we're<br />
perfect, a perfect thing, you and I. Because we're not two<br />

My face is hot. I am sitting in front of a fire.


All Emily gave seemed the gift of love and all Emily withheld
seemed withheld out of honor. <i>If only I were free</i>, she was always saying.
<i>But I can't just leave Vanessa</i>. Then I would feel ashamed of my inner
Stephen and humble myself to the very dust.


<i>The heroine hates you</i>, I want to shout at that former affair-bound self.


<i>The drug is destined to disappoint!</i>


<i>Stephen went and knelt beside her. She cried like<br />
a child. Angela was stirred to something like love.<br />

else really matters. And so it began all over again</i>.


ONE AFTERNOON Emily and I see a movie about two men who love
each other but will not claim this love in public. After the credits roll,
we walk into the afternoon light with our hands over our eyes. We drive
back to my house and talk about the film—the blood-spattered murder
scene, the brutal tenderness of Heath Ledger's shoulders and eyes, the
stupid brouhaha over gay cowboy sex—all nervous chatter to avoid talking
about our own brokenness.


I extend my hand and draw Emily to the floor between our chairs.


We press against each other, pull at each other's clothing, breathe

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>This is the last time</i>, I think to myself.


I think about something Emily told me after Valentine's Day. She
had given her teenage daughter a one-pound bag of candy and Jade ate
the whole bag in one night. I feel angry with Emily for giving her daughter
the whole bag of candy and expecting her to not to eat it. Now I
am the teenaged daughter and Emily has handed me the whole bag of
candy. I have gorged myself on her and I feel sluggish and ill.


<i>Why does she keep letting me make myself sick on her?</i> Underneath
this thought, I know what is really true. I am not a teenager. I am not
her daughter. It is up to me to say no. To say I've had enough.


I tell her I'm getting sicker and sicker. I tell her it has to stop. My
voice is thin and broken. I can barely make myself say the words.


"I'm not eating. I have a headache all the time. I can't think
about anything but you. I can barely prepare to teach my classes. I'm
at the end of my rope, and I have to stop." I say this in a pleading
voice, wanting her to understand.


"This is not what I want, but if it's what you need, I will do it." She
doesn't want me to think it is easy for her or that she doesn't care. But
we are both tired.

I give us both another lie for consolation:


<i>This is not the end. This is not forever</i>.


We agree (again) to stop seeing each other until she finalizes her
separation from Vanessa. My feelings for her are slowly changing from
the long wait. Instead of admiration and euphoria, I am weighed down
with anger and insecurity. I resent Emily for enjoying the benefits of
attachment while refusing the obligations of relationship. I resent myself
for going along with this bad bargain. Even though I strained and
choked on my request for a cleaner break, I am light with relief when
I leave her office. The movements of my limbs are more coordinated,
relieved from the tension of watching for texts proclaiming her abiding
love or announcing she will swing by for a brandy.


<i>I'd rather cut contact than keep waiting and wondering</i>.


I once read a story about a Puritan woman in Colonial America
who became so crazed by waiting to find out if she was among the
elect—the ones who go to heaven in the afterlife—she threw her infant
daughter into a well to die.


Just so she could stop wondering where she will end up.


<i>Hell it is</i>, she decided for herself.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here is what is hardest to explain.


<b>I CHOOSE HELL AGAIN AND AGAIN</b>.


I break up with Emily more times than I remember—my reconstructed
timeline is a tedious report of the days and reasons for each
decision to split—but we never follow through with the plan to stop
seeing each other. We never run out of excuses or holidays or alibis or
lies. We never pull back long enough to detox. Just long enough for
the most acute symptoms of addiction to subside. I am thoroughly
engaged by this game of EAT YOUR HEART OUT. I can't stop throwing
my organs like playing cards on the table and yelling at Emily
when she tries to pick them up. She is my attachment fetish figure
and I want to bind us together at the wrists and ankles. If I can
make her love me, a door will fly open and I will enter a world where
I am always safe and warm and full. She is KEY and DOOR and WORLD
and MEAL after savory meal. She is RESCUE and EMERGENCY and PYRO
and SIREN. She is MOON and LADDER and ENDLESS SKY OF WANTING.

I write her into every possible role in my fantasies of belonging and
escape. I love her and hate her. I make her up from scratch. We are on
again off again like a spinning ball of light. I court her with the inconstant
postures of the epileptic.


The question of how to remove the fishhook of obsession from my
own open eye will follow me long after I leave Emily for good. A year
after leaving Emily, I will lie in bed draining cognac straight from the
bottle, and I will stand up to go to the bathroom only to surprise myself
by slamming my fist into the full-length mirror on my wall. I will hit it
over and over, disconcerted when it doesn't break.


I drunk text her—<i>It's still you. For me</i>.—then fall into bed and sleep.

EVEN A SINGLE phone call from Emily easily plunges me back into
the confused mindset of hope laced with arsenic. I am pulled apart by
the vague pressures of free-floating depression. I watch movies all day in
the dark. I only leave my bedroom for more tea. I eat three bananas—
breakfast, lunch, dinner—piling brown peels on the bedside table.


<i>"What is wrong with me?"</i> I say to my therapist.


"SHE HOOKS YOU." She makes her hand into the shape of a hook.


"She communicates with you on all these different levels, so that
on one level what you hear is that you are loved for who you are no
matter what, and that it is okay if you are in a bad mood because everyone
has bad moods sometimes and it doesn't have to be a big deal. On
another level, what you hear is that you are not important enough to
hold her attention and you are not special enough for her to want to let
other people know you are in her life."


My therapist specializes in the neuropsychology of communication,
and she tells me that when a person receives multiple and conflicting
messages from an important figure in her environment, the
experience is disorienting. She tells me this is why I feel emotionally
dysregulated after I talk to Emily, even when the conversation is mostly
easy and fun.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"YES!" I sit up straighter in my chair. "I hear all these different
messages, and I tune in especially to the implicit messages, but then I
contrast them with the nice spoken ones, and I become obsessed with
the work of figuring out what is true, and whether the relationship is
good for me or not, and whether I should trust my intuition that it is not
good for me, or whether I should grow up and get stronger so that I am
less vulnerable to these uncomfortable parts of the relationship."


"There may be a middle path," she says. "Maybe you can just give
yourself some time. Maybe you can get to a point where you are less
vulnerable to this, but also realize you are not there yet, and that that
is okay."


I am still thinking about the disorienting effects of hearing conflicting
messages, of being loved and treasured and admired and also
neglected and abandoned and kept secret.


"And then," I go on, "I act like this complete crazy person! But the
situation MAKES me crazy!

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"When you put an emotionally sensitive person in an invalidating
environment," my therapist says, "you bring out her old patterns of
reaction. INSECURITY. ANGER. IMPULSIVENESS. Think of all the divorced
people who suddenly go crazy. Think of the slashed tires. And the person
says afterwards, <i>I don't know what came over me</i>."


We are smiling and nodding at each other.


Flash forward for a minute and let me tell you something that
happens several years later. I am standing at a street festival in
Charlotte, North Carolina—my third Gay Pride celebration of the
summer—talking with Yvonne and Bree. We have convened for an
afternoon of rainbow stickers and cheap beer in the full sun of late
summer. We are making the rounds, reading pithy slogans on buttons
and T-shirts along an aisle of vendor booths, and Yvonne stops
to speak to someone. She pats her congenially on the shoulder, says,
"Hey, girl, what's up?" But the woman she speaks to does not speak
back, and Yvonne looks like she's been slapped in the face.


We move on and circle our way back around to the beer booth.


"I cannot believe this," Yvonne says, while I gently tuck the dollar
in change down the front of the blouse of the beer vendor. I think

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Whoa. That is a bad feeling," I tell her. We are squinting at each
other in the brightness of the day.


"I'm going to go over there and ask her why she's acting like this."
"Maybe she's with another girl," Bree offers.


"Well then I'm going to go over there and tell her I don't care
who she's with, I still love her. As friends! I'll always love her. You
don't just stop caring about someone because you stop dating."
Yvonne's words are coming out more indignant than loving right
now. "I mean we were together for two years. You don't just stop
caring all of a sudden."


"I know how you feel," I say, glancing towards the woman who
wouldn't speak, who might be with another girl, who grieved with
Yvonne last week. "I know how much you want to go over there and
fix it, but let me run another way of looking at it by you." Yvonne and

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The most loving thing you can do right now is give her space. She
already indicated she didn't want to talk, so cornering her and trying
to make her is just going to push her farther away. That's the
surest way to never find out why she's not talking to you right now.
She'll get defensive. She'll turn away even more. But if you let her
be, she might get to a place over the next few weeks where she feels
like she can talk to you again, and you need to give her space so she
can come around on her own. And if she doesn't come around, that's
about her—that's her stuff—that's not about you or about your
value or about what you had or didn't have with her."


"That's amazing. That sounds like my astrology report." She pulls
out a folded piece of paper with her horoscope for the day, and it
really does say something about giving people space. "How did you
learn that?"


"Because I am an obsessor. Because I have tried to fix things." I swallow
another mouthful of flat beer. "Because it never worked." I picture
my phone hitting the wall, my hand on the razor blade, Emily's
initials beading up with blood on my ankle.


"Because I never felt better after acting on my obsessive impulse," I
say. "I only ever felt worse. And I wanted to stop feeling worse."

<i>There is a difference between love and human sacrifice,</i> I imagine
saying, but I hold the difference on my tongue and refrain from forcing
it into words. My impulse to explain tells me I'm still chasing
something, a rush of understanding that continues to elude me. I
want to be different but I'm not different yet.


I am using the story of Yvonne to distract you from the snakes
in my head—VICIOUS INTROJECTS who drive me crazy with the call to
come back for more, to die trying. True as it may be that FANTASIES
CAN BE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE WHO IS APPEASED BY INJURY TO THE
SELF, and that "THE LINK BETWEEN PRESENT AND PAST CAN BE WEAKENED
WITH PENETRATING QUESTIONS LIKE 'Do YOU LOVE THIS PERSON
ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM OR HER YOUR SELF-DESTRUCTION?'" the unfortunate
fact is this. My answer <i>(yes, still!)</i> is so often yes.


Let my mistress call. In the snap of her fingers I become the governor
of South Carolina throwing caution to the rip-roaring wind. I slip

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am another person. I am in another place.


<i>Sometimes you don't choose things. They just happen</i>.


That's what the South American girlfriend said. "I can't redirect
my feelings," she said. I want to tell her this is nothing to brag about. I
want to tell her you can get help for that. She speaks four languages. She
parents two boys. She translates things. Mark Sanford wanted something
from her. He made clumsy hearts with threadbare words. <i>You have
grace and calm and curves,</i> said the smitten kitten politician.


When he gets caught he is a ready confession.


He did not go hiking. He turned his phone off. He disappeared.
He crossed lines and he knows this. He cried in a woman's arms for nine
days. His wife said his whereabouts were none of her concern. People
declared his political future over.


"The writing is on the wall," they said. Still he did not step down.


<i>Before my affair with Emily ends I will lose my equilibrium entirely</i>.


I will cry in front of people I work with. I will inscribe hieroglyphs
of loss like teardrop tattoos on my arms and legs. I will spoon
secrets from the sockets beneath Emily's closed lids. Scoop morsels of
bliss like sweetmeats from her open bowels and offer them back to her
as gourmet treats.
