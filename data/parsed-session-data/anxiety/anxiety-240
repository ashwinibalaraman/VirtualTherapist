<font size="4"><b>Chapter 22: Stress, Uncertainty, and Health</b></font>

Uncertainty is part of life and is believed
to be inherent in the stress,
coping, and illness experience
(Babrow, Kasch, &amp; Ford, 1998) when persons
lack an adequate explanatory framework for
understanding their situations and predicting
outcomes (Yoshida, 1997). As such, uncertainty
is of interest to nursing. A search of the
Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL) database using
the word "uncertainty" for the time period
1982 through May 1998 yielded 1,056 records.
The majority of studies have investigated
uncertainty in acute or chronic illness
using one of Mishel's (1981,1988,1990) conceptualizations
or one of Mishel's (1983a,
1983b; Mishel &amp; Epstein, 1990) questionnaires
for assessing uncertainty or both, or
they have interpreted qualitative findings with
reference to Mishel's writings.


The concept of uncertainty is central to
understanding various aspects of the stress,
coping, and illness experience, including diagnosis
(Fillion, Lemyre, Mandeville, &amp;
Piché, 1996) and treatment phases (Christ-man,
1990; Mishel &amp; Sorenson, 1991) as well
as living with chronic illness (Hilton, 1988;
Lugton, 1997). Also, the literature on uncertainty
is not limited to the patient but also includes
friends and family members (Dickerson,
1998; Theobald, 1997). Moreover,
uncertainty is the central concept in the theory
of uncertainty in illness related to acute
(Mishel, 1981, 1988) and chronic (Mishel,
1990) illness and is implicit in self-regulation
models of coping with the illness experience
(Johnson, Fieler, Jones, Wlasowicz, &amp; Mitchell,
1997; Leventhal, Diefenbach, &amp; Leventhal,
1992).


In addition to a search of the CINAHL
database, the Medline and PsychInfo databases
were searched from 1982 through May
1998 to ensure that sources pertaining to the
concept of uncertainty and with significant
implications for nursing were identified.
Medline and PsycInfo identified 5,098 and
3,013 records, respectively. There were duplications
across databases, however, because of
the overlap in journals from which they abstract.

- <b>UNCERTAINTY IN ILLNESS</b>


<b><i>Mishel's Theory of
Uncertainty in Illness</i></b>


<i>Acute Illness</i>


According to Mishel (1984, 1988), <i>uncertainly</i>
is the inability to determine the
meaning of illness-related events and occurs
when insufficient cues prevent the person
from adequately structuring or categorizing
an event, thus inhibiting the person's ability to
predict outcomes adequately. The first pictorial
representation, the Model of Perceived
Uncertainty in Illness, focused on uncertainty
related to acute illness (Mishel, 1981). The
conceptualization was based on a cognitive
appraisal model and incorporated many conceptual
ideas from the writings of Lazarus
(Lazarus, 1974; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)
and other theorists, such as Moos and Tsu
(1977), Norton (1975), and Wyler (1974). According
to the model, factors within the person
and characteristics of the stimuli influence
the person's perception of illness-related
events. When stimuli are perceived as uncertain,
the person is unable to subjectively evaluate
the illness, treatment, and hospitalization
events. Lack of a cognitive structure of the illness
and related events hinders the person
from adequately appraising the situation, thus
influencing subsequent decision making.
Events perceived as uncertain are appraised as
threatening and necessitate coping with the
uncertainty. Stress occurs when the person is
unable to resolve the uncertainty. Therefore,
Mishel's (1981) original model conceptualized
uncertainty as negative.


Development of the Mishel Uncertainty
in Illness Scale (MUIS; Mishel, 1981) facilitated
research on this concept, which in turn
contributed to the revision of the model
(Mishel, 1988). The focus of the revised
model remained on uncertainty during
acute illness or downward illness trajectory
(Mishel, 1988) in patients undergoing active
medical treatment (Mishel, 1988, 1995). Key
concepts of the model include stimuli frame,
cognitive capacity, and structure providers as
antecedents to uncertainty; inference and illusion
as part of the appraisal process; coping;
and adaptation. A diagram of Mishel's (1988)
modified model is shown in Figure 22.1. The
major changes in the model included (a) the
use of the word "uncertainty" within the pictorial
representation, (b) adaptation as the major
outcome of coping with uncertainty, (c)
uncertainty appraised as an opportunity or a
"danger" (as either positive or negative), (d)
greater elaboration of stimuli characteristics,
and (e) the addition of resources (structure
providers).


According to the revised model (Mishel,
1988), <i>stimuli refers</i> to characteristics
of the stimulus as perceived by the individual
and consists of three components: symptom
pattern, event familiarity, and event congruency.
Uncertainty is likely to be present when
the person perceives (a) inconsistency in
symptoms to form a pattern (symptom pattern),
(b) the environment as sufficiently novel
(event familiarity), and (c) little or no congruency
between expectations and experiences in
the illness-treatment situation (event congruency).


<i>Cognitive capacity</i> refers to the ability to
process information. This capacity includes

Model of Perceived Uncertainty in Illness (reproduced with permission from Mishel, 1988. Copyright © 1988 Sigma Theta Tau International)</div>
[p. <i>520</i>]

<i>Structure providers</i> are the available resources
for assistance with interpretation of
the stimuli frame and include credible authority
(trust and confidence in the health care
provider), social support (availability of individuals
for assistance), and education. Education
contributes to the knowledge base from
which relevant cognitive maps are developed
and used for comparison with current illness-treatment
stimuli. It provides the person with
the ability to modulate the uncertainty
(Mishel, 1988). Structure providers directly
reduce uncertainty and indirectly reduce it
through the stimuli frame components.


Appraisal in uncertainty involves the processes
of inference and illusion. <i>Inferences</i> refer
to general beliefs about the self and one's
interaction with the environment (Mishel,
1988) and to the evaluation of uncertainty
based on related situations from the past
(Mishel, 1990). Personality dispositions, such
as learned resourcefulness, sense of mastery,
and locus of control, may affect the development
of inferences (Mishel, 1988) by influencing
perceptions and interpretations of current
stimuli that are then encoded into
memory. <i>Illusions</i> refer to beliefs arising from
uncertainty and generally reflect a positive
outlook. Significant others and health care
providers may help the person maintain hope
by fostering illusions. Inferences and illusions
result in appraisals of danger or opportunity.
Mishel (1988) emphasizes the experience of
uncertainty as neutral until it is appraised.


When uncertainty is appraised as a danger,
coping is initiated to reduce the uncertainty
and to manage the emotions through
mobilizing and affect-management strategies.
When uncertainty is appraised as an opportunity,
coping is initiated to maintain uncertainty
so as to sustain the belief in a positive
outcome. Buffering methods are used to block
the input of new stimuli that could alter the
person's appraisal of uncertainty as an opportunity.
Buffering strategies include avoidance,
selective inattention to information, minimization
of threatening information, and the reordering
of priorities. Effective coping via
buffering, mobilizing, affect-control strategies,
or all three promotes adaptation. Adaptation
serves as the outcome to effective coping
with uncertainty.


<i>Chronic Illness</i>


The original theory of uncertainty in illness
(Mishel, 1981), and the modification
(Mishel, 1988), were developed and tested
primarily within the context of acute illness or
downward illness trajectory and did not address
(a) the experience of living with uncertainty
within the context of chronic illness or a
treatable acute phase with probable recurrence;
(b) the nonlinear impact of antecedent
variables on the appraisal of uncertainty
across time; and (c) the possibility that growth
or increased complexity, as opposed to adaptation,
may be the desired outcome state
(Mishel, 1990). Moreover, contrary to the
original theory that postulates opportunity appraisals
only in situations characterized by a
high probability of negative consequences
(i.e., downward trajectory), uncertainty was
found to be appraised as opportunity in long-term
chronic illness without a downward trajectory
(Mishel &amp; Murdaugh, 1987). In response
to these problems, Mishel (1990)
reconceptualized the theory for use in chronic
illness. The reconceptualization assumes
those persons with chronic illness are receiving
maintenance treatment for their condition
(Mishel, 1990, 1995).


The theory of uncertainty in (chronic) illness
incorporates the following characteristics
(Mishel, 1990): (a) As an open system, the
person interchanges energy with the environment;
(b) the person can change over time; (c)
the person's appraisal of uncertainty is not
static but evolves over time; and (d) the desired
state may not be equilibrium but rather

[p. <i>521</i>]

When instability in the personal system
reaches a critical threshold, the person is propelled
toward a new state characterized by a
higher-order, more complex orientation toward
life. Structure providers, previous life
experiences, and the person's physiological
status influence the formation of a new life
orientation. The new worldview being constructed
is characterized by probabilistic and
conditional thinking and necessitates the person's
acceptance of uncertainty as inherent in
life. The person gradually moves from an uncertainty
appraisal of danger to an appraisal of
opportunity.


Because the new orientation toward life is
fragile, the person needs assistance from the
environment to support the necessary cognitive
restructuring. The process of reevaluation
of uncertainty can be blocked or prolonged
when (a) the person does not interact with potential
social resources, (b) structure providers
do not support the person's probabilitic or
conditional view of life, (c) the provider's approach
to the provision of health care communicates
an overt or covert devaluation of the
probabilistic view, and (d) the person's role
responsibilities compete with the psychological
work necessary for structuring of the new
value system.


In response to a critical review (Mast,
1995) of the research on adult uncertainty in
illness, Mishel (1995) emphasized that the
two conceptualizations (Mishel, 1988, 1990)
are not interchangeable. Whereas the first
conceptualization (Mishel, 1988) addresses
persons receiving active medical treatment for
the acute phase of an illness, the second conceptualization
(Mishel, 1990) addresses
persons receiving maintenance treatment for
stabilization of a long-term illness (Mishel,
1995). Therefore, studies addressing one conceptualization
cannot be interpreted in terms
of the other. Mishel (1990) cautioned, however,
that the theory was reconceptualized
"not to disregard the existing theoretical statements
and linkages but to expand them to account
for a perspective of growth and self-organization"
as an outcome of coping with
uncertainty in chronic illness (p. 258).


- <b>MEASURES OF UNCERTAINTY</b>


<i><b>Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Scales</b></i>


Mishel's uncertainty questionnaires are
the primary paper-and-pencil tools used to assess
uncertainty in illness (Mishel, 1981,
1983a, 1983b, 1984; Mishel &amp; Epstein,
1990). Her original work on instrument development
began with the MUIS (Mishel, 1981).
The 30-item scale was constructed to examine
uncertainty in adults undergoing treatment for
an active disease process. The MUIS uses a 5-point,
Likert-type format and has undergone
several revisions as a result of multiple psychometric
evaluations. Versions range from
28 to 34 items and yield two to four factors:
(a) ambiguity of illness cues, (b) complexity
related to cues about the treatment and the
system of care, (c) inconsistency related to information
received, and (d) unpredictability
of illness outcomes from illness and treatment
cues. Factor reliabilities range from .71 to .91
and are strongest for ambiguity and complexity
(Mishel &amp; Epstein, 1990).


Diagnostic-specific versions of the uncertainty
scale have been developed to enhance
clinical application of the questionnaires to
specific diagnostic groups (Mishel, 1983a).
Persons with various health problems, such as
cardiovascular and lupus patients, completed
the MUIS, and cluster analyses were used to
develop the diagnostic-specific versions. The
specific diagnostic version is administered together

[p. <i>522</i>]

Whereas the MUIS was designed for use
with hospitalized adults, a 28-item community
version (MUIS-C) is used for nonhospitalized
adults. The community version may be
used by family members of the nonhospitalized
chronically ill (Mishel &amp; Epstein,
1990). A 34-item Parents' Perception of Uncertainty
Scale (PPUS) (Mishel, 1983b) was
used to evaluate the degree of uncertainty perceived
by parents of an ill child and can be
modified for use by a spouse or relative of an
ill family member.


The MUIS has been translated into Swedish,
German, Chinese, Egyptian, Thai, Korean,
and Hebrew (Mishel &amp; Epstein, 1990).
Initial work on a Swedish version of the
MUIS provides support for the cultural equivalence
of the uncertainty concept (Hallberg &amp;
Erlandsson, 1991; Mishel, 1991), although
questions remain regarding the consistency of
the definition of uncertainty in the Swedish
language and culture (Mishel, 1991, 1997).


<i><b>Uncertainty Stress Scale</b></i>


Hilton (1994) developed the Uncertainty
Stress Scale (USS), which is intended to measure
uncertainty, the stress occurring from that
uncertainty, and the degree to which uncertainty
is perceived as threatening or positive
or both. The first part of the measure (60
items) asks respondents to rate their degree of
uncertainty about their health condition and
their coping with that uncertainty using a 5-point
scale. Respondents are given the option
of indicating whether the item is applicable or
not applicable. The second part of the questionnaire
asks respondents to rate their degree
of stress related to each of the uncertainty
items on a 3-point scale. The third part uses
visual analog scales to measure global uncertainty,
global stress, global threat, and perceptions
of positive feelings arising from the uncertain
state. A subscale score for each section
can be obtained by summing the responses for
each section.


The USS has undergone several revisions,
and the author expects additional reduction
of items to create a more streamlined version
(Hilton, 1994). Factor analysis yielded
two factors: (a) indefiniteness and lack of clarity
about the present and future state of the
disorder and (b) being unsettled or having
doubts about coping. Internal consistency
reliabilities for the factors are .96 and .94, respectively.
Construct validity of the USS has
been reported (Hilton, 1994). Clauson (1996)
adapted the USS to create a high-risk pregnancy
version.


<i><b>Appraisal of Uncertainty Scale</b></i>


The Appraisal of Uncertainty Scale is a
15-item questionnaire derived from a scale
designed to assess coping responses (Folkman,
1982; Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). Each
item represents an emotional state, such as
sad, fearful, and hopeful. Respondents rate the
degree to which they feel each emotion in response
to the uncertainty perceived using a 6-point
Likert scale ranging from "not at all" (1)
to "a great deal" (6). Eight items comprise the
Danger Appraisal subscale, and seven items
comprise the Opportunity Appraisal subscale.
Coefficient alphas range from .76 (opportunity)
to .87 (danger) (Mishel &amp; Sorenson,
1991). Table 22.1 provides a summary of selected
studies that have used one or more of
the questionnaires described.


- <b>RESEARCH RELATED TO
UNCERTAINTY IN ILLNESS</b>


Mishel's uncertainty in illness theory related
to acute (Mishel, 1981, 1988) and chronic
(Mishel, 1990) illness remains the sole nursing
theory specifically addressing uncertainty
in illness. Linkages between concepts can be
supported through direct testing of the linkages
or by explaining study findings in light
of existing conceptualizations (Mishel,
1997). The direct testing of linkages provides
for the greatest precision because the

[p. <i>526</i>]

On the basis of a review of the literature,
61 articles were found that used the MUIS, an
adaptation (e.g., PPUS), or parts of the instrument.
The majority of studies using the
MUIS, however, were not based on any of
Mishel's (1981, 1988, 1990) conceptualizations.
Some studies tested an investigator-developed
framework, and others were
atheoretical with linkages to Mishel's (1981,
1988, 1990) conceptualizations made in light
of the findings.


Studies of illness uncertainty can be divided
into eight categories by type of illness
(acute, chronic), person experiencing uncertainty
(patient or family member), and
developmental age of person (child or adult).
Because Mishel's (1981, 1988) original conceptualizations
were related to the acutely ill
adult, most of the research is in this area.
Studies to evaluate uncertainty in the chronically
ill adult and in family members were
stimulated when the MUIS was adapted for
these populations. The evaluation of uncertainty
in children and adolescents (Ellett &amp;
Young, 1997; Steele, Tripp, Kotchick, Summers,
&amp; Forehand, 1997), either as the patients
or as family members, is minimal. In
keeping with the original model (Mishel,
1981, 1988), this review of the literature on
uncertainty in illness focuses on acute illness
in adults and uses the major concepts of the
model (Mishel, 1988) as the organizing force.
Next, research on uncertainty related to
chronic illness in adults, children and adolescents,
and family members is discussed.


<i><b>Acute Illness in Adults</b></i>


Mast (1995) evaluated the literature on
adult uncertainty in both acute and chronic illness,
whereas Mishel (1997) focused on uncertainty
in acute illness, including the adult
patient and the family member of an acutely
ill adult or child. The purpose of this discussion
is to highlight the consistencies and inconsistencies
related to findings on uncertainty
in acute illness and Mishel's model
(1988).


<i>Stimuli Frame</i>


Stimuli frame (characteristics of the stimulus
as perceived by the individual) is proposed
to be an antecedent of uncertainty, but
interpretation of findings is difficult because
the majority of studies in illness uncertainty
did not directly test the linkage between stimuli
frame and uncertainty. Mishel and Braden
(1988) tested the linkage directly in women
with gynecological cancer and found that
symptom pattern predicted ambiguity but not
complexity, whereas event familiarity predicted
complexity but not ambiguity.


Diagnostic specificity may be considered
an aspect of stimuli frame. Uncertainty is expected
to be higher prior to diagnostic specificity
when symptoms are present but a diagnosis
is absent or before all diagnostic
information is complete (Mishel, 1988).
Overall, studies supported a linkage between
diagnostic specificity and uncertainty (Fillion
et al., 1996; Mishel, 1981; Northouse, Jeffs,
Cracchiolo-Caraway, Lampman, &amp; Dorris,
1995).


<i>Cognitive Capacity</i>


Cognitive capacity (the ability to process
information) is proposed to influence uncertainty
indirectly through stimuli frame. No
studies in the illness uncertainty literature
were found that directly tested this linkage.
Severity of illness may be considered an indirect
measure of cognitive capacity because
severity of illness and its intensive treatment,
such as the experience of pain and the use
of pain medication, may influence an individual's
capacity to perceive and interpret
stimuli.

[p. <i>527</i>]

The majority of studies indicate a positive
relationship between illness severity and
uncertainty, but the findings are not conclusive
(Mishel, 1997). The approaches used to
assess severity of illness are varied and range
from recurrence of illness (Hilton, 1994) and
objective pathological indices (Staples &amp;
Jeffrey, 1997) to self-report measures of
symptom distress (Christman, 1990) and
functional status (Christman et al., 1988; Staples
&amp; Jeffrey, 1997). Some consistency of
measuring illness severity is sorely needed.
Moreover, clarification of relationships
among the concepts of cognitive capacity,
stimuli frame, and uncertainty requires studies
that directly measure cognitive capacity.


<i>Structure Providers</i>


Structure providers (available resources)
are proposed to influence uncertainty directly
and indirectly by providing assistance in interpretation
of the stimuli frame (Mishel,
1988). The literature provides greater support
for the structure providers of credible authority
and social support and less support for education
(Mishel, 1997).


Several studies (Bennett, 1993; Davis,
1990; Mishel &amp; Braden, 1987,1988; White &amp;
Frasure-Smith, 1995) support an inverse relationship
between social support and uncertainty
across diverse populations, such as cardiac
(Bennett, 1993; Davis, 1990; White &amp;
Frasure-Smith, 1995), gynecological cancer
(Mishel &amp; Braden, 1987, 1988), and trauma
and postsurgical (Davis, 1990) patients. Although
increased social support has been
linked to less uncertainty, Mast (1995) notes
that little is known about how social support
ameliorates uncertainty and how unsupportive
relationships may heighten the patient's uncertainty.


Credible authority was also associated
with decreased uncertainty (Mishel &amp; Braden,
1988; Molleman, Pruyn, &amp; van Knippenberg,
1986), but the indirect path through symptom
pattern was not supported in a sample of
gynecological cancer patients (Mishel &amp;
Braden, 1988). In a study of 56 cardiac patients,
illness uncertainty was lower in
patients who perceived they had received adequate
information from a credible health care
provider (Sheer &amp; Cline, 1995). Uncertainty
was not decreased, however, in newly diagnosed
diabetic patients when a provider-centered
style of communication discouraged patients
from seeking answers to their questions
(Mason, 1985).


Findings related to education are inconsistent.
Some studies found an inverse relationship
between education and uncertainty
(Christman et al., 1988; Hilton, 1994; Mishel,
Hostetter, King, &amp; Graham, 1984), whereas
other studies found the opposite (Galloway &amp;
Graydon 1996; Mishel, 1984; Wong &amp;
Bramwell, 1992). There is evidence that the
influence of education and social support on
uncertainty may change over time (Christman
et al., 1988; Mishel &amp; Braden, 1987).
Therefore, research is needed to determine the
influence of structure providers across the illness
process. Through the process of cognitive
appraisal, the person judges the event to
be a threat or an opportunity, and this in turn
influences the type of coping to be used
(Mishel, 1988). Although Mishel's (1988)
model highlights the importance of cognitive
appraisal to coping and adaptation, few
model-based studies were found that sought
to investigate variables influencing the cognitive
appraisals of danger and opportunity. The
majority of studies focused on the relationships
between uncertainty or mastery and
cognitive appraisals.


<i>Appraisal</i>


High levels of uncertainty were associated
with threat of cancer recurrence in acute
and chronic breast cancer survivors (Hilton,
1989), danger in women receiving treatment
for gynecological cancer (Mishel, Padilla,
Grant, &amp; Sorenson, 1991; Mishel &amp; Sorenson,
1991), and less hope in cancer patients receiving
radiotherapy (Christman, 1990). There is
evidence, however, that the relationship between
uncertainty and cognitive appraisal is
mediated by mastery (Mishel et al., 1991;

[p. <i>528</i>]

Mishel (1995) identified several concepts,
such as optimism (Mishel et al., 1984),
sense of personal control (Braden, 1990a),
and learned resourcefulness (Braden, 1990a),
that may serve as other potential mediators related
to inference in cognitive appraisal. Research
is needed to identify other variables
that may mediate between uncertainty and
cognitive appraisal and to test interventions
that incorporate strategies related to cognitive
appraisals for promotion of healthy adaptation.


In Mishel's (1988) model, cognitive appraisal
mediates uncertainty and coping. Several
studies (Mishel et al., 1991; Mishel &amp;
Sorenson, 1991) of uncertainty in gynecological
oncology patients support this relationship,
with uncertainty appraised as a danger
predicting emotion-focused coping and
uncertainty appraised as an opportunity predicting
problem-focused coping.


<i>Coping</i>


Most investigations of uncertainty and
coping have examined this linkage directly
rather than indirectly through appraisals of
danger and opportunity. Testing of direct relationships
indicated that uncertainty was associated
with coping that is focused on controlling
emotional distress (Mast, 1995; Mishel,
1997). Inconsistencies in the testing of direct
relationships were noted, however, when subjects
were studied over time (Christman et al.,
1988; Mishel, 1997; Redeker, 1992).


Few studies have examined uncertainty
and coping during the course of an acute
illness using a repeated measures design.
Also, it remains unclear how the type of acute
illness, such as myocardial infarction, and
previous illness experiences influence the relationship
among uncertainty, coping, and
adaptation. Moreover, the conceptualization
and measurement of the coping variable may
influence results. New measures of coping are
needed that incorporate strategies relevant to
reducing the stress of uncertainty (Mishel,
1997). Qualitative studies that investigate
coping with uncertainty across types of illness
and over time are needed to generate items for
inclusion in coping scales and to determine if
there is sufficient variation in responses to
warrant the tailoring of coping scales to specific
clinical populations similar to Mishel's
(1983a) tailoring of uncertainty scales.


Mishel (1988) proposed that coping mediates
the relationship between appraisal and
adaptation. In a study of 131 women receiving
treatment for gynecological cancer, Mishel
and Sorenson (1991) found little support for
coping strategies as mediators between emotional
distress and appraisals of danger or opportunity.
Only two coping strategies, wishful
thinking and focus on the positive, were found
to mediate between danger or opportunity appraisals
and emotional distress, and the mediation
effect for each was small. A replication
testing of the mediation effect of coping in a
more heterogeneous sample of women also
found limited support (Mishel et al., 1991).


<i>Adaptation</i>


Most studies have not tested coping as a
mediator between uncertainty and adaptation
but rather the direct relationship between uncertainty
and adaptation. Moreover, adaptation
has been operationalized in various ways,
such as anxiety, emotional distress, quality of
life, health, recovery, and adjustment (Mast,
1995; Mishel, 1988, 1997). In general, research
has demonstrated a relationship between
uncertainty and poorer psychosocial
outcomes. Uncertainty has been linked to anxiety,
depression, and emotional distress as
well as to poorer psychosocial adjustment and
quality of life in a variety of populations, such
as in breast biopsy (Northouse, Jeffs, et al.,
1995), breast cancer (Wong &amp; Bramwell,
1992), cardiac (Bennett, 1993; Christman et
al., 1988; Webster &amp; Christman, 1988),
gynecological cancer (Mishel &amp; Braden,
1987; Mishel &amp; Sorenson, 1991; Mishel et al.,
1984; Padilla, Mishel, &amp; Grant, 1992), and
hysterectomy patients (Warrington &amp; Gottlieb,

[p. <i>529</i>]

In her review article, Mast (1995) posed
the question of whether uncertainty inevitably
produces negative patient outcomes and concluded
that studies of adaptation to long-term
uncertainty, such as in chronic illness, may
demonstrate the phenomenon of positive reappraisal
that Mishel (1990) hypothesized in her
theory reconceptualization. There is evidence
in the research literature that the degree and
type of uncertainty may change over time,
leading to the phenomenon of positive reappraisal
(Hilton, 1988; Nyhlin, 1990).


<b><i>Chronic Illness in Adults</i></b>


There is a growing body of research related
to uncertainty in chronic illness across a
wide variety of populations, ranging from patients
with abdominal aortic aneurysm
(Patterson &amp; Faux, 1993) and AIDS and HIV
(Barroso, 1997; Gaskins &amp; Brown, 1992;
McCain &amp; Cella, 1995; Regan-Kubinski &amp;
Sharts-Hopko, 1995; Sharts-Hopko, Regan-Kubinski,
Lincoln, &amp; Heverly, 1996; Weitz,
1989) to patients with stroke (Häggström,
Axelsson, &amp; Norberg, 1994) and ulcerative
colitis (Dudley-Brown, 1996). Approximately
half of the studies reviewed used a qualitative
approach with phenomenological or grounded
theory designs predominating.


<i>Antecedents to Uncertainty</i>


Several studies examined severity of illness
as an antecedent to uncertainty. Uncertainty
was positively correlated with severity
of illness as measured by repeated surgeries
in peripheral vascular disease (Ronayne,
1989) and perceptions of illness severity in
rheumatoid arthritic (Braden, 1990a, 1990b)
and asthmatic patients (Janson-Bjerklie, Ferketich,
&amp; Benner, 1993). Mast (1998), however,
found no relationship between uncertainty
and disease state in breast cancer survivors.
Hawthorne and Hixon (1994) found that diminished
functional status was associated
with uncertainty in heart failure patients and
noted that patients grouped by functional status
had different illness trajectories, supporting
the importance of assessing severity of illness
in chronicity.


Other studies have investigated the structure
provider variables of education and social
support as antecedents to uncertainty in
chronic illness. Studies reviewed generally
found an inverse relationship between education
and uncertainty in persons who had been
diagnosed with breast cancer (Mast, 1998),
multiple sclerosis (Wineman et al., 1996), and
abdominal aortic aneurysm (Patterson &amp;
Faux, 1993), extending the linkage proposed
by Mishel (1988) to chronic illness. Although
there was no significant difference in uncertainty
between multiple sclerosis patients who
agreed to participate in a clinical trial and
those who refused, acceptors reported a
higher educational mean (Armer, McDermott,
&amp; Schiffer, 1996).


<i>Social Support</i>


Uncertainty was positively correlated
with perceptions of unsupportiveness or dissatisfaction
with social support in 118 adults
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (Wineman,
1990). Moreover, unsupportiveness was
related to purpose in life through the variable
of uncertainty. Although there was a
dearth of quantitative studies investigating social
support and uncertainty in chronicity,
social support was an important theme in
many qualitative studies (Lugton, 1997; Nelson,
1996; Regan-Kublinski &amp; Sharts-Hopko,
1995; Thibodeau &amp; MacRae, 1997).


Similar to Mishel's (1990) description of
environmental supports needed to promote a
person's new and fragile life, breast cancer
survivors used supportive persons to nourish
their changing identities (Lugton, 1997), as
did long-term survivors of AIDS, who renegotiated

[p. <i>530</i>]

<i>Appraisal</i>


Uncertainty was positively correlated
with the appraisal of danger in persons with
asthma (Janson-Bjerklie et al., 1993) and
rheumatoid arthritis (Bailey &amp; Nielsen, 1993).
Ambiguity was moderately correlated with an
appraisal of danger in persons with abdominal
aortic aneurysm, although there was no relationship
between total uncertainty scores and
appraisals of danger or opportunity (Patterson
&amp; Faux, 1993). The sample size was small
(<i>N</i> = 27), however, and subjects experienced
many other chronic illnesses, such as arthritis,
in addition to the chronic aneurysm. For
both multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury
patients, danger appraisals yielded more
emotion-focused coping, whereas opportunity
appraisals yielded more problem-focused
coping (Wineman et al., 1994). Choice of coping
strategies did not explain emotional well-being
once selected demographic and disability-related
variables were controlled, possibly
due to the coping instrument's deficiency in
defining the coping dimensions important to
that clinical population (Wineman et al.,
1994).


<i>Outcomes of Coping With Uncertainty</i>


Uncertainty was associated with poorer
psychosocial adjustment (Moser, Clements,
Brecht, &amp; Weiner, 1993; Mullins et al., 1995),
more depression (Wineman, 1990) and psychological
distress (Landis, 1996; McCain &amp;
Cella, 1995; Wineman et al., 1996), poorer
quality of life (Hawthorne &amp; Hixon, 1994),
and a lower sense of purpose in life
(Wineman, 1990). Mishel's (1990) reformulation,
however, allowed for growth rather than
merely stability and equilibrium. The concept
of growth is more clearly reflected in the qualitative
studies in chronicity.


Selder (1989) proposed a life transition
theory that describes how people who experience
a disruption of their reality reorganize or
reconstruct the existing one to create new
meaning and resolve uncertainty. The idea of
the process of transition was found in several
qualitative studies that were reviewed. For example,
breast cancer survivors learned new
ways of being in the world and of putting uncertainty
into life's perspective (Nelson,
1996). Cancer survivors spoke of the preciousness
of life (Hilton, 1988) and changes
in beliefs, values, goals, and roles that may
serve as a positive experience (Halldórsdóttir
&amp; Hamrin, 1996; Hilton, 1988).


Confronting a life-threatening illness
caused breast cancer survivors to think about
metaphysical issues, such as the nature and
meaning of life and the universe (Thibodeau
&amp; MacRae, 1997). Reappraising life and creating
positive meanings were reflected in the
interviews of diabetic patients facing long-term
complications (Nyhlin, 1990). Women
who survived a cardiac event redefined their
priorities and focused on those activities that
provided them with meaning and purpose
(Fleury, Kimbrell, &amp; Kruszewski, 1995).


Some studies have sought to understand
uncertainty in chronicity by sampling subjects
with a wide range of time since diagnosis—as
much as a 53-year time span (Landis, 1996)—
by collecting data cross-sectionally at only
one point in time or at several points within a
brief time period. Type and characteristics of
uncertainty, however, may change over time.
To develop an understanding of how uncertainty,
appraisal, coping, and well-being can
change over time and to determine what factors
facilitate or deter such changes, longitudinal
studies are needed to track persons from

[p. <i>531</i>]

<b><i>Children and Adolescents</i></b>


Most studies of ill children and adolescents
have focused on uncertainty in the parent
and not the child. Few studies were found
that focused on uncertainty from the ill child's
perspective.


Haase and Rostad (1994) used a
phenomenological approach to explore the
children's perspective of experiencing the
completion of cancer treatment in seven children
ages 5 to 18 years. Whereas parents' fear
of recurrence focused on the child's diminished
chance of survival, children's fear of recurrence
focused more on having to re-experience
the side effects of chemotherapy.
For children, talking about their fear of recurrence
was associated with a belief that their
cancer would return. This study indicates the
influence of the developmental stage on perceptions
of and coping with uncertainty.


The MUIS was used to assess uncertainty
in adolescents with cystic fibrosis, whereas
the PPUS was used to assess uncertainty in
parents (Yarcheski, 1988). On the basis of the
results, Yarcheski postulated that some of the
items on the total MUIS and PPUS may be extraneous
to the concerns of adolescents with
cystic fibrosis and their parents. It is also possible,
however, that the MUIS and PPUS did
not adequately capture the uncertainty concerns
of the adolescents and their parents.
Collectively, the two studies indicate the need
for tailoring the measurement of uncertainty
to the developmental stage and illness-related
concerns of the respondent.


<b><i>Family Members</i></b>


Thirty-seven articles were reviewed related
to studies of uncertainty in family members;
the majority (20) described qualitative
studies. Almost half (16) reported on studies
of parents of ill children (Cohen, 1993, 1995;
Cohen &amp; Martinson, 1988; Sparacino et al.,
1997), whereas 10 articles reported on spouses
of ill adults (Dickerson, 1998; O'Brien, Wineman,
&amp; Nealon, 1995; Stetz, 1989). The remaining
articles reported on studies of multiple
family members or did not clarify whether
other family members in addition to spouses
were investigated (Brown &amp; Powell-Cope,
1991; Jamerson et al., 1996; Malone, 1997).


<b><i>Parents</i></b>


Miles, Funk, and Kasper (1992) used the
PPUS to study uncertainty in parents of
preterm infants. Results indicated that the
highest level of uncertainty was in the area of
unpredictability, with mothers reporting
higher levels of unpredictability than fathers.
Uncertainty about the effects of prematurity
on their child's development was also
found in a qualitative study of parents attending
a neonatal intensive care unit follow-up
clinic, indicating a need for the provision of
more developmental and parenting information
(Hussey-Gardner, Wachtel, &amp; Viscardi,
1998).


Grounded theory was used to explore the
dimensions of uncertainty of parents whose
children were hospitalized in an intensive care
unit (Turner, Tomlinson, &amp; Harbaugh, 1990).
The results were similar to those found in the
PPUS; uncertainty related to the family system
and the parent-child role, however, extended
Mishel's work (Turner et al., 1990).


Uncertainty or mastering uncertainty was
a central theme of several qualitative studies
related to parents of chronically ill children

[p. <i>532</i>]

<i>Spouses</i>


A major theme of spouses whose partners
had suffered a myocardial infarction was
"crushing uncertainty" (Theobald, 1997).
Spouses had greater uncertainty about the illness
than did cardiac (Staples &amp; Jeffrey, 1997)
and recurrent breast cancer patients (Northouse,
Laten, &amp; Reddy, 1995). Uncertainty
predicted emotional distress in women experiencing
recurrent breast cancer and their
spouses (Northouse, Dorris, &amp; Charron-Moore,
1995), in individuals with multiple
sclerosis (MS) and their spouses (Wineman,
O'Brien, Nealon, &amp; Kaskel, 1993), and in
women awaiting a breast biopsy but not in
their respective spouses (Northouse, Jeffs, et
al., 1995). Although illness uncertainty was
an essential factor in determining family satisfaction
for the MS spouse, the congruence between
each partner's perception of uncertainty
was the crucial factor in determining family
satisfaction for the well spouse (Wineman et
al., 1993). Collectively, research in this area
demonstrates the importance of investigating
uncertainty in the spouse and the need to expand
and test Mishel's acute (1988) and
chronic (1990) illness models to incorporate
the spouse and the influence of each partner's
uncertainty on the well-being and growth of
the other.


<i>Other Family Members</i>


The remaining research either studied
multiple family members or did not clarify
whether other family members in addition to
spouses were investigated. In general, when
studies investigated multiple family members
results were reported as family findings rather
than by specific relationship.


The relative's illness and negotiating the
health care system served as sources of uncertainty
(Jamerson et al., 1996). Adult siblings
often felt left out of the decision-making process
and perceived that they had not received
enough basic information about their relative's
illness, suggesting information may not
be uniformly communicated throughout the
family. Family members of patients with heart
transplantation (Mishel &amp; Murdaugh, 1987),
childhood cancer (Clarke-Steffen, 1997), and
AIDS experienced "transitions through uncertainty"
(Brown &amp; Powell-Cope, 1991). Collectively,
these studies indicate the importance
of extending and testing life transition
theory (Selder, 1989) in family members of
those with chronic illness. Moreover, these
findings indicate the importance of studying
uncertainty in the family to determine how
uncertainty in each of its members influences
the well-being of the others.


- <b>HEALTH-RELATED
UNCERTAINTY</b>


Although Mishel's (1981, 1988, 1990) conceptualizations
have spawned a large body of
research on uncertainty in illness, some investigators
have extended the study of uncertainty
beyond acute and chronic illness. An
in-depth discussion of the theoretical and research
literature in this area is beyond the
scope of this chapter. Literature in this domain,
however, bears mentioning to appreciate
the breadth of and opportunities for research
related to uncertainty.


<b><i>Life Transitions and Events</i></b>


Uncertainty has been studied in relation
to normal life transitions, such as in pregnancy
(Patterson, Freese, &amp; Goldenberg,
1986), menopause (Lemaire &amp; Lenz, 1995),
infant adoption (Lobar &amp; Phillips, 1996), and
after natural disasters (Coffman, 1996). The

[p. <i>533</i>]

<b><i>Genetic Testing</i></b>


As the revolution in molecular biology
and genetics continues, genetic testing for
various diseases is likely to become more
available. Healthy persons with a family history
of a potentially inheritable disease may
experience substantial stress because of uncertainty
about their risk for developing the
disease. For diseases caused by inherited defects,
such as Huntington's disease, testing is
likely to produce different benefits and costs
than those for diseases with multiple causes,
such as breast cancer (Baum, Friedman, &amp;
Zakowski, 1997). Whereas genetic testing for
Huntington's disease may decrease risk uncertainty,
a positive result for the gene is likely
to cause emotional distress. Cast in stress theory,
Baum and associates (1997) presented a
model that predicts long-term stress in genetic
testing when risk uncertainty is minimally reduced,
when testing results suggest a high risk
or are at odds with preventive actions already
taken, and when people lack the resources for
coping with a high-risk result. As the use of
genetic testing continues to increase, testing
of this model and development of other models
related to anticipation and consequences
of genetic testing should prove to be fruitful
areas for nursing research.


<b><i>Dispositional Intolerance of Uncertainty</i></b>


Whereas Mishel focuses on uncertainty
in illness, several researchers, primarily from
the discipline of psychology, have focused on
various personality traits related to an individual's
intolerance of uncertain situations
(Freeston, Rhéaume, Letarte, Dugas, &amp; Ladouceur,
1994; Krohne, 1993; Sorrentino &amp;
Short, 1986). Those who are habitually intolerant
of uncertainty are likely to employ consistent
vigilant behaviors by directing attention
to threat-relevant information so as to
avoid surprises and decrease uncertainty
(Krohne, 1993). If individuals are simultaneously
intolerant of emotional arousal (anxiety),
however, vigilance will serve to heighten
their anxiety. The end result is less effective
coping characterized by fluctuations between
vigilance to decrease uncertainty and avoidance
to decrease anxiety. Research is needed
to determine how intolerance of uncertainty
and emotional arousal influences cognitive
appraisal of uncertainty in illness and subsequent
coping.


- <b>IMPLICATIONS OF
UNCERTAINTY FOR THEORY,
RESEARCH, AND PRACTICE</b>


<b><i>Theory and Research</i></b>


A review of the nursing literature indicates
high interest in the concept of uncertainty
in illness. The majority of quantitative
studies have been atheoretical with reference
to one of Mishel's(1981, 1988, 1990) conceptualizations
made in hindsight. An understanding
of the strengths and needed revisions
of the current conceptualizations (Mishel,
1988, 1990) is unlikely to occur until more research
is conducted in which the relevant conceptualization
(acute and chronic) drives proposal
development decisions.


Most studies referencing one of Mishel's
(1981, 1988, 1990) conceptualizations have
investigated uncertainty in ill adults. Few
studies (Yarcheski, 1988) have investigated
uncertainty in illness in acutely and chronically
ill children and adolescents, even though
developmental stage may influence perceptions
of and coping with uncertainty (Haase &amp;
Rostad, 1994). Research is needed in this area
and is likely to necessitate the development
of different methods and measures for the

[p. <i>534</i>]

In addition to the need for the development
of methods and measures for assessment
of uncertainty in youth, Mast (1995) questioned
whether the MUIS adequately measures
the concept of uncertainty experienced
in chronic illness because it was originally developed
to assess uncertainty in acute illness.
Moreover, Mishel (1997) recommended that
new measures of coping are needed to incorporate
strategies specific to stress reduction in
uncertainty.


Most of the studies reviewed that examined
illness uncertainty in family members
used qualitative methods. Quantitative studies
were primarily atheoretical, with results interpreted
using Mishel's (1981, 1988, 1990) conceptualizations.
There is evidence that uncertainty
in the ill person and that in the family
member are interrelated (Steele et al., 1997),
with issues and problems related to the family
system being a source of concern for parents
of ill children (Turner et al., 1990). Collectively,
research in this area points to the need
for determining the unique dimensions of and
relationships between uncertainty in the ill
person and family member given the specific
characteristics of and demands made by the
illness. As research in this area progresses, it
is likely that the current uncertainty conceptualizations
(Mishel, 1988, 1990), which were
developed with respect to ill adults, will be
modified to incorporate antecedent to and
consequences of uncertainty in family members.


Mishel (1997) noted that the role of personality
dispositions as predictors of uncertainty
or mediators between uncertainty and
cognitive appraisal is limited, with some support
for the mediating role of mastery. No research
was found, however, that examined
the relationship between uncertainty and the
personality variable of intolerance for uncertainty.
It is likely that dispositional intolerance
for uncertainty will influence perceptions of
illness uncertainty and cognitive appraisals,
and this bears investigation. In addition, research
(Germino et al., 1998) indicates that
ethnicity influenced the relationship between
uncertainty and coping. Therefore, Mast's
(1995) observation that the majority of studies
have examined uncertainty in Caucasian, middle-class
samples indicates the need for research
on uncertainty in diverse cultural populations.


<b><i>Practice</i></b>


Although few studies were found that investigated
interventions related to illness uncertainty,
most found uncertainty decreased
following intervention (Braden, 1991, 1992;
Hawthorne &amp; Hixon, 1994). For example, the
Self-Help Intervention Project (SHIP) for
women receiving breast cancer treatment uses
interventions for uncertainty management
based on five goals: (a) reinforcement of opportunity
appraisals; (b) promotion of elements
related to cognitive structure, such as
provision of information; (c) reduction of inappropriate
or incorrect certainty associated
with negative outcomes; (d) regulation of
emotional response; and (e) promotion of personal
control and probabilistic thinking
(Braden, Mishel, &amp; Longman, 1998). Although
the extent to which weekly telephone
interventions from the nurse contributed to a
decrease in uncertainty is unclear, the study
serves as a good beginning for determining
the effectiveness of uncertainty interventions.
Mishel (1997) concluded that the most effective
interventions were educational in nature,
providing information and skill building related
to management of uncertainty.


Uncertainty is not necessarily detrimental
(Mishel, 1988, 1990). On the basis of a literature
review related to uncertainty, Wurzbach
(1992) developed a guide to assess the client's
degree of uncertainty and proposed interventions

[p. <i>535</i>]

- <b>CONCLUSION</b>


Although the focus of this chapter was on illness-related
uncertainty in ill persons and
their families, it should be noted that some research
has focused on uncertainty in the
nurse. Studies have investigated decision
making (Baumann, Deber, &amp; Thompson,
1991), moral uncertainty about withholding
or withdrawing artificial nutrition and
hydration (Wurzbach, 1995, 1996), and risk
uncertainty in working with AIDS patients
(Reutter &amp; Northcott, 1993). The most systematic
research found, however, was in the
area of perceived environmental uncertainty.


Attempts to control increasing health
care costs have led to changes in the delivery
of care, the availability of health care resources,
and the acuity level of the patient
population (Salyer, 1995). To determine how
these changes influence nursing's job performance,
Salyer (1995, 1996) proposed and
tested a four-stage model that identified characteristics
of the environment and of the nurse
predicted to influence nursing performance. A
key concept of the model was perceived environmental
uncertainty, which was operationalized
by the 11 -item Perceived Environmental
Uncertainty in Hospitals Scale and defined
as the perception of uncertainty resulting from
the need for information and the complexity,
dynamism, and environmental dominance of
the organization (Salyer, 1995, 1996). Research
on the model is limited, and support is
mixed, ranging from partial (Salyer, 1995,
1996) to minimal (Callahan, Young-Cureton,
Zalar, &amp; Wahl, 1997).


Allred and associates (Allred, Hoffman,
Fox, &amp; Michel, 1994; Allred, Michel, et al.,
1994) also investigated perceived environmental
uncertainty through their Perceived
Environmental Uncertainty Questionnaire
(PEUQ) designed to measure the "degree of
complexity, change, unpredictability, and uncertainty
associated with the information, resources,
or relationship factors identified as
most important to providing patient care"
(Allred et al., 1995, pp. 130-131). For a complete
description of the four-part questionnaire
with results of psychometric testing,
consult articles by Allred and associates
(Allred, Hoffman, et al., 1994; Allred, Michel,
et al., 1994). The PEUQ identified three distinct
nursing practice environments characterized
by increasing levels of complexity,
change, unpredictability, and uncertainty
(Allred, Michel, et al., 1994). With the capacity
to differentiate nursing practice environments,
this questionnaire provides an opportunity
for designing and testing practice models
to facilitate effective and efficient nursing
practice outcomes.


In conclusion, the nursing literature is replete
with references to uncertainty, with most
sources referring to uncertainty in acute and
chronic illness. There is also a systematic and
growing body of research related to perceived
environmental uncertainty and efficient quality
of care, however. Opportunities for research
on uncertainty abound, whether the researcher
is interested in focusing on the
patient and family or on the nursing practice
environment.
