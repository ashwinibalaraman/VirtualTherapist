DR. KAHN STIRRED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I HAD BEGUN
to talk. He lifted his face from his hands and looked at me
sharply.


“A baby?” he said in surprise. “I don't understand-----”


“It's not what you expected, is it?”


“Frankly no ... With all your talk about a double life
I thought you were going to tell me something much worse.
You dramatize yourself too much. That's a neurotic trait. It's
one of your faults and weaknesses.”


“I suppose,” I said almost sardonically, “you expected me
to tell you something disgraceful about sex.”


The doctor nodded.


“Don't misunderstand,” he said. “I don't believe analysis
should concentrate wholly or even mainly upon sex. Sex is
an important part of life, but it's not the only factor, and

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“No such factor,” I said, “entered into my case. I didn't
fool around with either girls or boys. Outside of school I had
no friends of either sex. There was no time. I always had to
take care of the baby-----”


“Whose baby was it?”


“My sister-----”


“Then why did you have to take care of her? Where were
your father and mother? Why couldn't they take care of
her?”


“Because they were in the store,” I replied with an outburst
of rage and bitterness almost startling in its vehemence.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“They were always in the store. Nothing else ever really
mattered to them. It was not just a business to them; it was
an obsession--a compulsion--I hardly even know what to call
it-----”


I broke off abruptly. I was beside myself and trembling.
Without realizing it, I was shaking my fists at the doctor as
if he were to blame for the situation that had ruined my
adolescence. I felt a tremendous inner tension amounting to
a spasm. I wanted to hit somebody--anybody--it didn't matter
whom-----


“What sort of business was it?” asked Dr. Kahn quietly.


I looked at him and hesitated. His voice had a soothing
effect. I stopped shaking my fists.


“It was a dress store,” I said in a subdued tone. “Just a
little store ... with crumbling walls and dilapidated fixtures
and an old-fashioned, bulging, wooden front. It was
hopelessly run-down, shabby, neglected and--and”--I fidgeted
and groped for a word--“ramshackle. It stood on a dark
street paved with cobblestones and cluttered with trucks and
trolley-cars and under a dingy, creaking, whining, rattletrap
‘El’. You could feel the store shaking each time a train rumbled
overhead. My mother used to say it was like a regular
earthquake.


“I don't know very much about the business, Doctor. I
have never understood it. My parents were always very secretive
about it and kept the books under lock and key. They
never tried to teach me their line. My father used to go out
almost every day to buy merchandise for the store, but he
never took me with him or introduced me to any of the
wholesalers or jobbers with whom he dealt. I never made
even a single contact in the garment trade. ...

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“My father also worked as a tailor in the back of the store.
He used to prepare the dresses for display--this involved
cleaning, pressing, sometimes finishing the hem or sewing
on buttons and the like. He also made alterations to fit the
customers, and sometimes he made a dress to order. Yet he
would never let me help him in any way, and he never even
once tried to teach me how to sew or how to operate the
pressing machine or how to cut cloth from a pattern or even
such a simple thing as how to take a customer's measurements.


“My mother worked as a saleslady in the store. But she
never tried to teach me anything about selling. ‘You can't
sell,’ she would say to me. ‘Don't ask--’ She repeated this so
often and on so many different occasions that she must have
ended by convincing me. I remember that when I went to
college, I took a job selling magazine subscriptions, but every
time I approached a customer, I would hear my mother's
voice whispering in my ears: ‘You can't sell ... You can't
sell ... You can't sell ... Don't ask--’, and then I would
choke up completely. I would feel such a tension in my
throat that I couldn't even talk to a customer. It was pretty
hopeless, and I had to give it up. I don't think that I made
a single sale. ...


“I associate that choked up sensation with the store. I felt
it when I was only three or four years old. My parents used
to quarrel about the business. They both came from Russia,
and they would argue in Russian because they didn't want
me to understand what they were talking about. I watched
them as they argued and argued furiously in Russian, turning
my head anxiously from one to the other. I wanted to
run over to them and put my arms around them and squeeze

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“‘Mama ... Papa ... what's the matter? Why are you
fighting?’


“My parents would both turn to me, and my father would
say angrily: ‘Nothing ... We're only talking. Mind your
own business!’ and my mother would say, ‘Yes ... darling.
We're only talking.’ She would try to smile, but instead of
laughing, she would start to cry. ‘Yes ... We're only talking ...’
She would sniff and dab at her handkerchief.


“‘Why are you crying? Mama ... Mama ... Please
don't cry!’


“‘I'm not crying ... I'm just wiping my glasses-----’


“When I saw them quarreling so plainly in Russian and
then denying that they were even having an argument, I
would feel such resentment, such tremendous resentment--
stuck, pierced, wounded, stifled--that I choked ... I felt
I would never forgive them because they seemed to think I
was so stupid I couldn't tell they were fighting ... I would
start to cough violently. I would cough and cough and cough
until my eyes turned red and I spat blood-----”


“You bit your tongue,” said Dr. Kahn. “That's why you
spat blood.”


“My mother would feel my forehead and take me home
and put me to bed and call the doctor. We lived in a tiny
three-room apartment overlooking the ‘El’. It wasn't a very
nice apartment, and I hardly remember it, but it was near

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“It was always my throat. I had a chronic sore throat as a
child. There was always pus and inflamed tissues and difficulty
in swallowing. I coughed and wheezed and gasped for
breath. I had one sickness after another--an endless series of
sore throats. I suffered from strep throat, the grippe, bronchitis,
the whooping cough, laryngitis, diseased tonsils ...
And nobody ever realized that all these sicknesses started with
the choked-up feeling I had in connection with the store. I
didn't, of course, know it myself, but there was a definite
psychological basis for all these illnesses. Again and again I
came down with a sort throat after seeing a fight between
my father and mother over the business. It was the store,
Doctor, always the store-----


“You see, these fights between my parents over the conduct
of the business happened very often. My parents could
agree upon almost everything--they had the same tastes, the
same interests, the same opinions--except the store. I can't
recall an unkind word between them unless it related to the
store. I don't think anything else ever really mattered to
them. It was the store--always the store-----


“Later on I began to understand what all these quarrels
were about. The issue was really very simple. My father
always wanted to run a one-price store. He wished, as he
would have phrased it, to be independent. ‘If you don't pay
the price,’ he wanted to tell the customers, ‘you can get out!’

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was to be no bargaining in his store. ‘You can't,’ I can
remember him saying on more than one occasion, ‘bargain
with Macy's or Gimbel's--well, you can't bargain with me
either.’ This was his idea of a high-class business, and it was
his ambition to build up just such a business ... Now my
mother always frustrated this ambition. She had a habit of
haggling with the customers. If a dress were marked at ten
dollars and a woman offered to buy it for six dollars, my
mother would compromise by letting it go for eight. My
father, seeing this, would become furious.


“‘You're ruining the business,’ he yelled. ‘You're giving
away the merchandise!’


“He would stride up and down, raging and cursing. ‘It's
not a store,’ he screamed, grinding his teeth together. ‘It's not
a business ... It's a junk shop. That's what it is--a junk
shop ... Let's burn it up! ... This store is a sickness--a
disease.’ He stamped his feet and the saliva dribbled from his
lips as he pronounced the word, disease. ‘It's a pain in the
neck--a sore throat ...’ He would go on and on. There
was no stopping him once he started. He would continue
until he became hoarse.


“All this, I suppose, may sound a little funny in English,
but actually it was spoken in Yiddish, and it sounded perfectly
natural. My father always cursed in Yiddish. He never
said anything unfit to print. Instead he would rattle off the
names of various diseases--a typical method of cursing in
Yiddish. ‘Cholera, T.B., plague’--he waved his arms frantically
as he pronounced these words like an incantation--
‘Malaria, typhoid fever, leprosy ... He seemed to know
every disease in the medical lexicon.


“That's why,” I added, struck by a sudden realization, “I

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Sometimes my parents, upset by my constant hacking and
coughing, would start to holler at me. My mother would grab
me by the shoulders and shake me violently.


‘“Stop coughing already,’ she would cry. ‘I can't stand it
no more!’


“Frightened, I stopped, but my face would puff and turn
blue.


“You deliberately withheld your breath,” said Dr. Kahn,
“in order to stop your coughing. That's why your face puffed
and turned blue. You produced the same symptoms as a man
drowning. But in a way,” he added reflectively, “you were
lucky. All you did was cough and have a few sore throats.
You might easily have become a stutterer, and then you
would have had an even more serious problem. Or you might

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“But I never realized I was hysterical, Doctor. I was always
so calm and subdued that I was the very last person anybody
would have ever suspected of being an hysteric. Even as a
child I was very quiet and obedient and hardly ever became
angry. I can't remember ever having a real tantrum. My
brother had a terrible temper as a child. He would scream
and stamp his feet if he didn't get what he wanted. He was
very spoiled. I was supposed to be the good one in the family.
I thought that he was hysterical; yet I was the one-----”


“You were both hysterical,” said Dr. Kahn, “because you
were both affected by your parents' constant quarrels over the
store. But his was more on the surface, while you repressed
your hysteria even as a child. That's why yours was more
dangerous and led to definite symptoms such as your coughing
and choking.”


“You know,” I said, struck by a sudden flash of memory,
“I think my father almost caught on to the truth about my
childhood fits of coughing. I remember something that I
haven't thought of in years.” My memories were beginning
to awaken and stir; the repressed was returning to consciousness.
I felt giddy and a little feverish; but in spite of this,
surprisingly enough, I was finding it much easier to talk.
“My father used to take me aside from time to time and talk
to me seriously. He would pick me up and put me on his
knee.


“‘Hecky,’ he said, ‘Hecky’--this was my nickname as a
little boy--‘I want you to try not to cough so much.’


“‘I can't help it,’ I said defensively.


“‘But try,’ he insisted. ‘Do me a favor and try.’ It was

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I knew exactly what he meant. I knew that in some way
I couldn't explain I brought on all these coughing spells
myself and that I could stop them whenever I wanted to.
My father knew this too, or at least he must have suspected
it, because once when I started to wheeze and cough fitfully,
he came over to me and said: ‘Stop right away and I'll buy
you a present!’ I stopped at once, and he went out and bought
me a toy.


“It was a cheap little wooden clown--you wound it up
with a key to make it dance. I didn't get very much enjoyment
out of it. I broke it almost immediately. I broke it because
it made me feel so guilty. I knew I didn't deserve it.
After all, it was only a bribe, and even as a child of three or
four, I was aware of the distinction--although I could not,
of course, have put it into words--between a bribe and a
present. You can't really fool a child.


“I felt guilty, you see, because inwardly I knew and, indeed,
couldn't help but know that I could stop my coughing
spells whenever I wanted; but the truth is that I didn't really
want to stop because it was the only way I could attract the
attention of my parents. Otherwise they ignored me because
they were always so busy with the store. It was the store,
Doctor,--always the store-----”


I paused abruptly and cleared my throat. Talking about
the store had revived the symptom which I had always felt in
connection with it as if to demonstrate anew by empirical
evidence that it really was psychologic in origin.


“The store,” I continued, with a mounting sense of strain,

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I remember an incident which happened in the store
when I was about three years old. A woman came in one
day to buy a dress. While my mother showed her various
dresses that hung on the rack, I climbed onto a chair, as I
always did, and sat there quietly. I don't know exactly what
happened next--I must have dozed off or started to day-dream
--but when I woke up with a start, I had wet my pants and
made a puddle on the floor. The customer became annoyed
and left--maybe she didn't like any of the dresses she saw--
but I felt that I had ruined the sale. My mother became furious
and began to holler at me. She wasn't mad, she said, because

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“‘Don't you realize, are you so dumb,’ she yelled, while
changing my pants, ‘that the store is for business and that
no matter what, you're not supposed to interfere with business?
How many times do I have to tell you? Don't you understand
that if I don't sell dresses, there won't be any money
and we won't have what to eat? I won't tell your father what
you did this time, but the next time!’


“She went on and on. Like my father, once she got started,
she couldn't stop ... I wanted to scream, but I held it in.
I felt that I had done something awful and bowed my head
in shame. You would think that I had done it in a
church-----”


I paused for a moment and listened to my own words. I
seemed to hear an echo--it reminded me of something.


“You would think that you had done it in a church,” said
Dr. Kahn, repeating my own words as if to underline them.


“Just before I entered the Old Hospital,” I continued, “I
went into a little church, and then I was overcome by an
impulse--the craziest one I've ever had--to urinate right on
the altar. Yet it wasn't really the church--it was the store ...
I can't help thinking that these two incidents must be connected.
For some reason I associate the store and the church
in my mind.” I paused once again and tugged at my memories.
“When I was a child, I used to have a dream--a recurring
dream. I haven't thought about it in years, and I never
told anybody I had it. <i>I dreamt that I went into a church
and urinated on the altar</i> ... I can even remember specific

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097986-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't know exactly why, but as I said this, I felt a tremendous
and, indeed, almost shattering sense of release accompanied
by a discharge of tension. It was as if an electric
current had been shot through the inner circuit of my brain.
By holding back these dreams, by keeping them a secret
locked within myself, I had impeded the flow of memory and
erected, so to speak, a dam in the middle of the river of consciousness.
I had, in other words, created a mental block. The
moment I spoke, however, the dam burst--the flow of memories
swept through uninterruptedly--the block broke--and
then I remembered just what had happened to stimulate or
motivate these dreams. ...
