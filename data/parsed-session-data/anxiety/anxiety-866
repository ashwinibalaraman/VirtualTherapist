______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: —laughing at me—I'm like, "You don't understand. I feel so much better than before." (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs) (pause for .04 seconds) So clearly you got my message.
CLIENT: I did, yeah.
THERAPIST: I left several messages.
CLIENT: I've been in like a fog lately so Trae's sleep has totally gone from bad to worse -
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: since the last time I saw you. I feel like I've just been so forgetful. I was thinking that it was this week that we had changed the time, but it's so weird that I didn't put it in my phone. I can remember putting it in. So I'm glad that I didn't miss anything.
THERAPIST: Always better to check.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely.
THERAPIST: Totally worth it to call and check. We sort of bounced the schedule around so it's partly your sleep deprivation and partly the fact that, well we talked about it.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. Well I'm feeling like that's been the most thing that's been on my mind lately, is just trying to figure this out.
THERAPIST: So what's going on?
CLIENT: It's hard cause I feel like—I think we just got really lucky with him toward the beginning. He really was a pretty good sleeper. We had our troubles but, for the most part, I think he was pretty good. We were always really careful about putting him in his crib when he was awake—we'd go through our little routine about putting him down awake. [00:01:16]
And now he's just lost all ability to get himself to sleep when he goes down awake. And even, like I think the last time I was here, it was kind of starting —.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you had had a couple of nights —
CLIENT: we were having trouble, yeah. But then over the weekend—like he's not a fussy baby at all, but he was just screaming when we would put him down. And then we'd go in and he would quiet right down, so we knew it wasn't that he was hungry, or -
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: At first we were worried that he was getting sick or something because it was just so unlike him.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: But I just wonder if, because now he's getting older and so much more alert, that he does want us and we know that we really can't have that association; of trying to get him to sleep with us.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: So it's just been so hard, and I feel like not sleeping a lot is hard, and then when there's like a day when Todd and I were both on edge with each other—I think just because we were stressed out and not knowing what to do. [00:02:11]
THERAPIST: Um hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: I feel like we've done a better job of acknowledging how we're both tired and how that can make, you know, us short with each other. But seeing that, you know, we are a good team and can get through this. So I feel like we had one night of just being argumentative and trying to figure out what was the best thing to do, and he was crying in the other room. 
But since then—I feel like that was good for us to just get us on the same page. And now -
THERAPIST: So you guys feel like you have a game plan.
CLIENT: Kind of. And we've read all about sleep training and then all of a sudden he developed this little rash on the back of his legs on Sunday, so we had to take him to the pediatrician. It was nothing but at least I got a chance to talk with her about her feelings too. I know it's so controversial.
THERAPIST: Such a touchy area.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: Everyone has their own set of beliefs. [00:03:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. So I feel like that was one thing that was kind of hard for me and Todd. I think he was feeling strongly about doing the sleep training like a week ago, and I was kind of on the fence. But I think now that we've talked to his doctor -
THERAPIST: (laughs) And it's been another week like this. (ph)
CLIENT: What we've gone through this week, yeah, I think I'm with you now. But now it's kind of just funny trying to figure out when, when do we actually do it. All of our friends who have actually done it say that they read Ferber's book and it can take four days or a week or whatever.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: You know, the friends that we've talked to. But I can't imagine, like—when do you do those four days to yourself? It's just going to be awful. But we're also saying, "Well the past few nights have been awful anyway." (laughs)
So I feel like we are getting a little bit more on the same page. We don't have an exactly perfect game plan yet, but -
THERAPIST: There is no perfect time.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: I think you try to look for when might this be least miserable and least intrusive—[00:04:04]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: but you're not probably going to find a perfect time.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I think I was saying to Todd, "We should wait until Thursday, because that way Friday is a nice day for us and then it's into the weekend." But now last night, Todd is like, "I don't know if we can wait until then."
It's also hard cause we never—it's like these feelings of getting so frustrated with him which feel (pause for .02 seconds) new.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you haven't had this.
CLIENT: I feel like I get that with the nursing, and that's another thing I can talk to you about too.
I feel like I've kind of felt that, from the beginning, those ups and downs with nursing. But that's really—like he's been so good for us, other than that, and I feel like now Todd is starting to really experience those feelings of frustration and -
THERAPIST: Which are even harder when you're tired, sleep-deprived. It's harder to deal with those feelings.
CLIENT: Yeah. And even this morning, I was with him—my mom comes around 11 on Tuesdays and I was trying to get him—it's napping too, anything sleep-related, is just not working right now. [00:05:04]
And our morning together, I'm trying to get him down for a nap and I was getting so frustrated, and that was a bad feeling too. I was thinking, like, "Well now I'm going to be leaving you for the whole day, and my last interaction with you is being frustrated trying to get you to take a nap."
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: So it is just hard to have these feelings coming up too, you know.
THERAPIST: It's hard to anticipate what you are going to feel.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you sort of anticipate these warm, loving, in-awe-of-your child feelings.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you have these very human, frustrated, tired, angry -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that's okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's okay to be frustrated with him. It's okay to be mad at him for not, you know, doing what he's supposed to do to make your life more manageable.
CLIENT: Right. (laughs) I know. And it does help—I feel like we've definitely reached out to our friends and Todd has a little circle of his guy-friends too that are dads. [00:06:01]
And so I feel like that's helpful to know that—I think we just have gotten lucky. It's pretty good that he's 6 1/2 months old and I feel like we really haven't hit the bottom (laughs) of being so tired yet. So in a way I guess that's good. But it does -
THERAPIST: It doesn't make it easier when you're there.
CLIENT: No. But it's nice to know that our friends have gone through the same thing and even my friend —.
THERAPIST: It helps to normalize the experience.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you like your friends, obviously.
CLIENT: Exactly.
THERAPIST: You're not worrying if they're bad people.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I'm wondering if you're worrying that—if you're wondering that about yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah. Especially with my best friend, Stephanie, who has her little one year old. I always thought of him as this amazing sleeper and I was texting her the other day. I was like, "Todd's really pushing sleep-training and I don't know if I'm ready for it. I don't know what to do." And she's like, "Oh yeah. We definitely did that with Jackson."
And just hearing that made me feel better too. I think I envisioned him as not having any trouble.
THERAPIST: Perfect.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. And to know that even they had their troubles with him and had to try something, some new strategy with him too made me feel a little bit better. But (pause for .02 seconds) I do feel like we'll have to figure some things out. [00:07:15]
And talking to his pediatrician yesterday made me feel better because it's also this worry with him not gaining weight—or, he was gaining weight, but just not enough. We weighed him when we took him in yesterday and he gained half a pound in just two weeks so I feel much better about that. But I think that was making me a little more worried about trying sleep-training, whereas Todd just feels not so worried about the gaining weight. I think that kind of put us on different perspectives too.
THERAPIST: Um hmm. You wanted to focus on the weight, he wanted to focus on the sleep.
CLIENT: Yeah. So, but he doesn't usually want to eat in the middle of the night anyway. He's just kind of awake. (laughs)
So I feel like now that we've kind of talked to different sources that we're ready to try the sleep-training. [00:08:01]
THERAPIST: What are you worried about with the sleep-training?
CLIENT: Just hearing him cry—I just feel like that will be awful. And even one of our friends was saying, "Just go take a walk around the block if you need to." But, just like, especially because he doesn't usually cry. He really just cries when something is wrong, usually.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: And now it's—like, it's cause he just doesn't want to go to sleep.
THERAPIST: Right. And that's the thing that's wrong, maybe. You said he quiets down when you come in, so for him that is something wrong. He would like you there then.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And for him, that's a very legitimate want.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And he doesn't see any reason why he shouldn't have that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because a six month, six-and-a-half month olds are extremely self-centered -
CLIENT: Um hmm, (laughs) yes.
THERAPIST: as they should be, and he would like your company then. He would like your company. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it doesn't mean he has to have it. What he wants and what he has to have are not the same thing. [08:56]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I know he's just exhausting himself. My mom just texted and he took a 3-hour nap today and he doesn't usually do that. So I know he's just so tired too. So I feel like that is telling me too that we really need to do something, because he's showing us during the day that he just is -
THERAPIST: Right, that he's really not okay to be up right then, if it's having this affect later in the day.
CLIENT: Yeah. So.
THERAPIST: I'm sure listening to him cry, hearing him cry and not soothing it will be really hard.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) But again I do feel like now that we've talked so much about it, I think—and Todd is saying too—like it's not going to be easy for him to hear him cry either. But knowing that we're doing it together and just see what happens.
THERAPIST: Figuring out how you and Todd can support each other.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, figuring out what you need. Is what you need for him to stay and you to go take a walk? Do you take turns? 
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, talking about—and you may have to change your game plan partway through because you haven't experienced this yet—
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Finding out how do you support one another, and sooth one another, for what might be hard. Any maybe it won't be as bad as you're imagining. [00:10:15]
CLIENT: Yeah. I know that's true, but (laughs) I'm really envisioning the worst. And I feel like him not sleeping has now made me so on edge. We finally got him to sleep last night and I could not fall asleep. And so I was just getting frustrated with myself too. 
I remember he was asleep, and going to bed last night—sometimes I chuckle to myself and I know I shouldn't, but I'm like, "Oh, am I going to have trouble falling asleep." And I did that last night and I remember thinking to myself, "There's no way I'll have trouble falling asleep. I'm so tired."
And then I climbed into bed and, of course, I couldn't fall asleep. 
THERAPIST: You're over-tired. [00:10:56]
CLIENT: And I just feel like—part of it I'm listening for him and then thinking about stuff for school and then anticipating even coming here, and like, "Oh what should I bring up to talk about?"
And just like—there was so much going on through my head, but also knowing, I think the idea of him, that he could wake up at any point, was making it worse.
THERAPIST: Um hmm. I just need two hours maybe. (laughs)
CLIENT: (laughs) So it's hard -
THERAPIST: Yes it's very hard.
CLIENT: Knowing I had a lot of reading to do today, and I was thinking like, "Well, if I'm so tired, like how am I going to do all this reading. My eyes are going to be so tired." So I finally did get to sleep. But then of course that's when he wants to wake up.
Todd was really good about getting up with him those times because he knew I was having trouble sleeping. But, I feel like that has been hard too, especially now because I'm reading so much about sleeping so I feel like that's just bringing my own sleeping to the front of my mind too.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: So, (pause for .02 seconds) [00:11:57]
THERAPIST: I think that being able to separate what's going on with your sleep as a result of you, from what's going on with your sleep as a result of the environment, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sounds like your sleep was screwed up last night because of the environment you had—you had a very tense, anxious environment. Worrying about Trae, worrying about how long you had to sleep.
CLIENT: Um hmm.
THERAPIST: This is not your typical scenario and that's not your—that's not a sleep disorder for you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's the environment that is very disordered and you had a pretty normal reaction to that. It doesn't necessarily mean anything with regard to what your sleep would be like when you can get your environment settled.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you will.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't know how long exactly that it's going to take. I'm sure Ferber will tell you exactly -
CLIENT: (laughs)
THERAPIST: that not all children follow Ferber's book to a T.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs) But that, you know, it will get settled. It will get figured out at some point. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You don't know exactly how long it's going to take, but Trae will learn again how to put himself to sleep. [00:13:02]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then you will have a more predictable environment that you can then figure out how to put yourself to sleep.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: And it might be a little bit, you know, variable in between.
CLIENT: Right, okay. Then that makes me feel a little better too because I feel like (pause for .02 seconds) it was a double last night of—you know, worrying about his sleeping and here I am awake. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: That's something that I've always—you know, when I'm struggling with that too it gets me.
THERAPIST: Right. Well when things are in your control you know what to do.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But Trae's not in your control.
CLIENT: Right. I wish that he was. (laughs) It would be so much easier.
THERAPIST: It would. But you lost that when you gave birth actually. (laughs) 
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: You had it for nine months.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: And, you know, you'll get that sorted out and then you'll go back to being able to control your own thing.
CLIENT: Um hmm. (pause for .03 seconds) Yeah. So hopefully we'll get it sorted it out, sooner than later. Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) So we'll see. [00:14:00]
And I do feel like it's harder now just cause both of us are back at school and at work.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Not that there's an ideal time for this to happen, but it is hard cause we're right in the middle of the semester when everything is busy for both me and Todd, so it's just hard.
THERAPIST: Yeah. You're juggling a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You're both juggling your roles academically, you're both juggling your roles as parents, and you're trying to also be married.
CLIENT: Right. (laughs) I know. (pause for .02 seconds) And I feel like with him nursing too, this past weekend, just did not go very well either. I feel like now that we're so tired, I just have—I feel like I'm not able to cope as well with things when I'm over-tired, which I think is -
THERAPIST: Totally normal.
CLIENT: everyone. Yeah. But we just—it's hard when—and I think some of it is just like he might have to poop, you know. He just doesn't nurse well. But it's just so hard and I feel like now with the extra pressure of just wanting to make sure that he's gaining weight, and then last week when someone else is watching him he's getting bottles of breast milk. Then Friday came along and I was looking forward to Friday—it's my day home with him. [00:15:13]
The past couple of Fridays we've just had fun stuff going on; like my cousin was in town one weekend, and I don't know what happened two Fridays ago, but this was the first Friday where we didn't have anything planned. It was just going to be a nice low-key day, and he was having so much trouble nursing. 
It was just such a bad feeling to think, like; here he is going Monday through Thursday doing fine, drinking tons of milk through bottles and now here is my turn -
THERAPIST: When you say he's having trouble with nursing, what's going on?
CLIENT: He just gets really, um, antsy. He'll be latched on but he's just moving and won't sit still at all. And he'll keep popping off and looking at me.
THERAPIST: Um hmm. [00:16:00]
CLIENT: And I know he just like—and it happened a while ago, that shift where I need to be in a really quiet environment. But now it's almost—well at least that day—it was worse, because he just was popping off and it was just the two of us at home, so it was quiet. No TV, no radio, nothing was on, but he still was just having so much trouble.
THERAPIST: Is he uncomfortable? Does he want to play?
CLIENT: It's hard to tell. Like with that, I think he did have to poop. We've been giving him solid foods too, so I think that's like —.
THERAPIST: Um hmm. It's a very different sensation for him.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: To have a bowel movement that's more solid.
CLIENT: Right. (pause for .02 seconds) But it's just hard thinking, "So you're doing so well with the bottle," and then he actually is doing really well with solid foods -
THERAPIST: Are you feeling rejected?
CLIENT: Yes, definitely. Yeah and it's just a (pause for .02 seconds) bad feeling cause I was looking forward to Friday too.
THERAPIST: You want the nursing to be special.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: And he's not, he's reacting as if it's not as good as other things.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
THERAPIST: That's a hard feeling. [00:16:57]
CLIENT: I know. I feel like it's really hard. I know like, my friend Stephanie, and some other friends who have breast-fed their babies—they definitely feel that too. But I think it's hard for Todd because—he got home on Friday and so, the first time it didn't go well I was like, "Well, okay. He probably just has to poop."
But then, the next time, it's hard because I feel like we'll have one bad one and I'll be frustrated but then get over it, but then three hours later it happens again, and then it happens again, so by the time Todd got home I was just upset about it. And I think he feels like—and we talked a lot about this after—like I was jumping to these negative conclusions of like, "He's preferring the bottle over me," and "What if this means the end?" like he just wants the bottle.
And I think he sees that as so negative and it's hard to remind him that—it's just different. I was trying to say like, "Well what if, all of a sudden, he wouldn't take a bottle from you?" But I still feel like it's a different—[00:18:00]
THERAPIST: What does it mean to you? What if he is on a nursing strike?
CLIENT: I know. I just feel like—I think I've set—I probably shouldn't have set a goal of trying to do this until he's one.
THERAPIST: So that's a goal you've set.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I probably shouldn't have done that, especially knowing me—I don't want to fail at this either, you know. And so I feel like there is this pressure to want to continue until he's one just because I know that that's what's best for him.
And I really—when we have good nursing sessions, I enjoy that. It's nice to know that that's one thing I can give him that no one else can either; which kind of cool, to have that connection with him.
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: Um, (pause for .02 seconds) but then it is this bad feeling of like, I also don't want to be selfish and push it with nursing when I know that if we did just give him a bottle he would get what he needed for that feeding, you know. [00:19:01]
THERAPIST: Do you know what his behavior is like when he's drinking a bottle?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, (pause for .02 seconds) Todd did say though—so it really was just over the weekend that we were having this trouble. And even when -
THERAPIST: So you're also nursing him in the morning and at night —
CLIENT: Yeah, um hmm.
THERAPIST: before you go to school.
CLIENT: Yeah, and sometimes in the morning it's hard but at night usually he's tired anyway, so then it's okay cause he's calm, usually. But even over the weekend he was all fidgety with Todd too. So that made me feel better, (laughs) at least.
THERAPIST: Right, cause it's not necessarily about being breast-fed. Currently he's just having trouble settling down to eat.
CLIENT: Yeah, right. (pause for .02 seconds) So it's just, it's hard. But then this morning, thankfully, was fine. He did a great job nursing; then it was just the nap that wasn't so fine. But he did do a good job nursing this morning so that makes me feel so much better.
But sometimes I feel that I just worry that is it slipping away and is he doing better with the bottle.
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: And Todd keeps reminding me that, "Well, he's still drinking a bottle full of breast milk that you're giving him." [00:20:05]
THERAPIST: That's true. And it sounds like it's two things though: when you're talking about this goal that you set for the year, um, (pause for .02 seconds) you said—I heard you say, "Well I know what's best for him." Well it's the breast milk.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's really important. And that's what he's getting in his bottle.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So if he's rejecting a breast, then you can still get him breast milk if you want to pump.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Also, medically, they get the most benefit really early on. And yes, I think AAP says a year.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know. The majority of that is up front, I think.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And later, you know, breast milk is never a bad thing but it is less and less essential —
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: the older they get, because they're getting nutrients from other things. But it sounds like it's not just the breast milk for you; it's also the bond of actually doing the feeding.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And having that skin-to-skin -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: it's meaningful to you and it's okay for some of this to be about what's meaningful for you as his mom. [00:21:06]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It doesn't all have to be about just the nutrition piece.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I think there's a bond piece there for you.
CLIENT: Definitely. And then it's hard too, because when it doesn't go well, it's like you want to have this bonding time and then it turns into a frustrating time, which is also hard.
THERAPIST: It's really disappointing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it hurts to feel like he's rejecting you, this thing you're trying really hard at.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) And it was a weird feeling on Monday, and I guess—Monday morning he didn't do well nursing again—and I was saying to Todd, "For the first time I'm almost glad because it's Monday and he'll be getting bottles all day, so I don't have to worry about him not getting enough from me. And I can just get a break."
And usually I hate when it's Monday—cause then it's a week of pumping, and it's just so annoying and all this. But with this week it was the first time when I was like, whew -
THERAPIST: Felt like a little bit of a relief not to—[00:22:04]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Not to feel responsible.
CLIENT: Yeah. And that was—I was saying to Todd that that made me feel awful though to be thinking that, because it was the first time I really felt that—of that session of nursing that I would have preferred to just pump and know that he was going to drink a six-ounce bottle or a five-ounce bottle or whatever, and we wouldn't have to worry about how much he was getting.
So I feel like that was different too.
THERAPIST: You're having a lot of new emotions.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or new emotions toward him.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) So —
THERAPIST: That's a lot to process.
CLIENT: I know. I do feel like right now, it's just a lot going on. And then when the rash appeared on his legs, Todd and I were like, "Oh, my gosh. (laughs) Well if it's going to happen this weekend," and then that ended up being nothing. But you know, it was either—we got him new little warm wool socks so it might have been a reaction to that, or just like a little viral rash or something. [00:23:03]
So it wasn't a big deal but that was starting -
THERAPIST: All these new experiences. You haven't had that yet.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You haven't dealt with the sleep thing yet.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You hadn't felt rejected in the way you were feeling rejected. It's a lot of new parenting emotions to take in -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: in a fairly short period of time.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) I know I do feel like it's all of this kind of coming at once. And I do think that just being tired makes us not able to handle this as well.
THERAPIST: Right. Each thing feels a lot more intense when you're tired.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And they build up and you reach your limit really quickly.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I was noticing that, with myself, even little things—like my sister, it was coming—she and her boyfriend are looking to move into the area and they're looking at an apartment near where we live. She texted me last night and she was like, "Can you ask you neighbor if you can borrow his parking pass?" cause my mom is watching Trae today so she has our visitor pass. And I was just like, "I can't ask him to do that." [00:24:03]
We've kept him up with Trae screaming I'm sure the past week and I was just kind of annoyed that she asked, and I was like, "You know what? There's on-the-street parking." We have a family friend who also has one and I was like, "You can ask him. I really don't want to have to ask our neighbor to borrow the pass right now." I have a feeling that he's, (laughs) that we're not on such good terms.
And I could tell that she got annoyed with me and I got annoyed with her, and then —
THERAPIST: And normally that would not be the case.
CLIENT: yeah, and then my mom came this morning and I brought it up, and I felt that she was defending my sister, and then I was just thinking I know I'm just so over-tired and that's why I'm reacting this way. You know, I was kind of on the way out of thinking this is so weird, that my mom is defending her. 
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: This silly little thing over a pass, and I knew that it was just getting into a bigger deal than it needed to be. But I think that it is just not having a good amount of sleep and just—[00:25:07]
THERAPIST: So how can you take care of yourself a little bit? I know there's one more person you need to take care of, meaning you, but you do need some taking care of.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I'm wondering what you can do to kind of replenish some of this?
CLIENT: Well I feel like that's why I was kind of frustrated with myself last night cause I almost felt like, well he's asleep and now I have the time to just sleep, you know, and to let myself relax, and I almost felt I was like working against myself. 
That I kept myself awake when he did kind of go for a longer stretch. If I had gone to sleep when I got into bed I think I would have felt a lot better today, you know. So I almost felt like that was making me angrier with myself last night cause I was working against myself, when I should be helping myself.
THERAPIST: But admonishing yourself does not actually help you to relax.
CLIENT: No, yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) And I think knowing—it's helpful to—like with my mother-in-law was here yesterday and my mom was here today, and they know that we're having trouble. My mother-in-law brought us dinner for last night, so people are definitely aware that we're going through a harder time with him. [00:26:18]
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: So I think it's nice that people recognize that. But it's hard to know when to fit in time to, time for yourself.
THERAPIST: It's wonderful that your mother-in-law sort of, she sensed it and she brought something. But you can ask for help too.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can ask—you have a good network of friends -
CLIENT: Right. We definitely do.
THERAPIST: that understand. You can ask somebody to come over for an hour on a weekend, if you want to just get a break or lay down.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think looking at ways that you can ask for a little bit of extra support -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: A tough time like this, it's not going to be forever.
CLIENT: Right. (pause for .03 seconds) And Todd and I were talking about that too, because we really haven't gone out to dinner or anything, the two of us—I think we've gone out once so far, just the two of us—and there've been a couple of other times where Trae has been with family and, us, we've gone out with a different member of the family, like out for a drink or something. [00:27:14]
THERAPIST: Um hmm.
CLIENT: But I think it's hard too—we were saying that we need to find someone who is not a member of our family who we trust with Trae, because right now I feel like our moms are being so helpful by watching him I don't want to have to—and I know that they'd jump at the chance to watch him again over the weekend, but my mom's already driving down twice a week for us anyway. It feels funny to have to ask more of them.
And my sister is starting to get a little more comfortable being with him by herself. She's a lot younger than me and was just like nervous about the whole thing, so I feel like she's just not quite ready to totally lean on yet as a babysitter—although she did try it last week for the first time for a couple of hours and felt good about that, so that was good.
But I feel like it will be good for us to just find someone who is totally—[00:28:03]
THERAPIST: A babysitter.
CLIENT: Yeah, like that we can pay and who is not -
THERAPIST: No strings attached.
CLIENT: Not doing us a favor and helping us out. Like we will pay you, like this is a business relationship, cause I think that that will help us. I do think it would be good for us to just get out.
THERAPIST: Yeah, have a little time that's fun for you.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: To not be responsible for a little bit.
CLIENT: Um hmm. (pause for .03 seconds) And even one of our friends was saying we could do some sort of like swap, where we could watch their baby and they could go out one time. Cause that's the other thing; babysitters are so expensive. We didn't realize that part, so maybe the swap will work better. (laugh)
THERAPIST: All of a sudden dinner becomes a lot more expensive.
CLIENT: I know, yeah.
THERAPIST: But I do think it's important because you're feeling worn-down, and while it's something that you can't demand that you get a certain amount of sleep —
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: you'll need to replenish that at some point but you don't know exactly when that's going to be able to happen. [00:29:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But getting out and being able to have a separate experience, being able to focus on your relationship a little bit, and have that replenish you—that's something that you actually can do. And if you take your friends up on this swapping offer, make sure you get your turn first. (laughs)
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or finding a babysitter that you trust that can be, you know, no strings attached, no favors. Just cough up the money and go.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. And I do feel like we have made jokes about, "Like we need to focus on our relationship. We haven't been out in a while." So at least we're talking about that.
THERAPIST: But you're both aware that it's a thing. (inaudible at 00:29:46)
CLIENT: But it definitely is a thing now, yeah, that—it's not that we're in a bad place because of it, but I think that we are recognizing that we just aren't feeling -
THERAPIST: You miss it.
CLIENT: Right, that there's time to take care of each other in the way that we could have before, and, yeah. (pause for .04 seconds) So, (laughs) [00:30:05] 
But it does, it definitely feels like there's a lot but then you could just take a step back too and know that it's all normal and that everyone's gone through this too. But I think when we're really in the midst of it right now, it's hard.
THERAPIST: Well, I think everything you're talking about is really normal, and these are things that lots of couples and parents of young children have gone through. That doesn't make them easy.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Parenting is really, really hard.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And babies are hard. They're easy in some ways and really, really hard in others. And just because your friends have gone through it and countless other people have gone through it does not mean that it should in any way be easy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you've never gone through it before.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So these are all new feelings for you and all new challenges for you —
CLIENT: Um hmm.
THERAPIST: and it's hard to figure out how you cope with it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: How you make sense of what you're feeling and how you come to terms with feelings that feel hard.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .03 seconds) But it does feel good to know that those are the normal feelings and it's nice that I feel that I have as much time to have those worries that aren't so -
THERAPIST: That this is normal stuff.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I do keep catching myself worrying again that I'll have those same worries, and I feel like I bring it up every time I talk to you. And even with -
THERAPIST: They live there.
CLIENT: Yeah. Two weekends ago I think I mentioned we did a little girls' weekend away with our babies -
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.
CLIENT: which was really fun. It was funny because I think we thought of it as this fun little weekend getaway and didn't realize how it was really hard—just with one person and your baby, like Todd -
THERAPIST: No husband to trade off with. [00:32:00]
CLIENT: and we're all so busy with our own babies that we really couldn't even help each other that much. So we were tired by the end of the weekend, but it was definitely really good. 
And my good friend, Stephanie, one of her friends came too, who I know pretty well, and once the babies were to bed that first night, she was sharing with us how she's been feeling all this anxiety and she was saying how she recently had a panic attack. Part of me felt really good because we aren't that close, and it was nice that she was sharing -
THERAPIST: She felt comfortable.
CLIENT: you know, that she could share it with me. But then it was like me catching myself thinking like, "Oh, my gosh. I remember those feelings so well," and that brought it back up for me too, like thinking more about it.
And so it was weird to just like—cause then I was thinking like, "Here I am—we're up in Canada. What if that happens again? What if I did have a panic attack?" like what would I do?
THERAPIST: How did you answer that question? What if? [00:32:57]
CLIENT: And I think I knew (pause for .02 seconds) I knew that I am in a spot now where I think I don't have to worry about that as much.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: But I was thinking—well, if something happened, like Stephanie's there and I could talk with her and I know that would help me to feel better. It wasn't like I was feeling like I was away from Todd or from being able to talk to my mom or someone about it, and have to handle it on my own—which I think scared me the most when it first happened cause I was by myself.
So knowing that she was there and I was able to not really think about it. But it was interesting for me that, hearing our friend talk about it made me just think more about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it makes it sort of a real possibility —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: instead of a thing that you imagined could happen.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Here is actually happening to somebody.
CLIENT: Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) And it was funny too cause I was sharing with her a little bit, that I was like, "I can definitely relate. I've been having trouble," and it was funny in some ways to be talking to her as someone who could give her advice, as a person -
THERAPIST: You are. [00:34:12]
CLIENT: who is kind of past that, but at the same time I was kind of laughing at myself thinking like, "Here I am: giving this advice and being able to comfort her." You know, about how scary that is, but that you can get through it, and find someone to talk to—giving these pieces of advice but then in the back of my mind thinking, "Oh, my gosh. I hope that doesn't happen this weekend." (laughs)
THERAPIST: (laughs)
CLIENT: It's this funny feeling of like I'm past a bad time but never feeling like, is it really past? Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well, you've gone through it, and does that mean that you're never going to experience it again? (pause for .02 seconds) Unfortunately, I can't say that.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: But you're never going to go through it for the first time again.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And one of the big differences maybe between your experience right now and her experience right now is that you have developed a set of skills to cope with it if it were to happen again. [00:35:10]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You've experienced it. You had that long period of anxiety and then you got to a place where you came in and you got some skills and you understand more of what the process is like for you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can kind of predict a little bit what's going to happen, you can intercede, and it sounds like she maybe hasn't had that yet.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: She hasn't learned how to help control it when it gets going.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you know that you do have a set of skills and you've got this sort of bag of tricks that you can use: —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: whether it be checking in with someone or asking yourself some questions or doing the deep breathing or helping yourself think differently about it; that actually do impact the course of your anxiety.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:35:59]
THERAPIST: So that means that if it were to come up again, it's not going to be the same.
CLIENT: The same, yeah.
THERAPIST: And that's maybe part of what you can use to help comfort yourself, is well what if it happened? Well, if it happened you will be really uncomfortable for sure, and I would know what to do. 
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you might be able to help her kind of figure out what to do cause you do have this wisdom of having lived through it.
CLIENT: (pause for .02 seconds) Yeah, and it does feel good to know that I do feel like I know so much more about how to handle it.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you really do.
CLIENT: But then I was thinking, like last night I was trying the breathing and I got up and read, you know, but I guess it did work because I did fall back asleep.
THERAPIST: You did eventually fall asleep.
CLIENT: Part of me last night was like, "Ah! These are the skills that I've been developing and why aren't they working?"
THERAPIST: Why are they not working fast enough? (laughs)
CLIENT: (laughs) Yeah.
THERAPIST: They are the skills. They don't necessarily always work exactly in the timeframe that you want them to. 
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: And, like we said, it's not totally under your control. 
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:00]
THERAPIST: But it was one night and you're still here.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: You're tired but you're still here.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And I do think that that's been helpful to know that I can still get through the day.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you can still scratch through. 
CLIENT: And I almost finished the book that I was supposed to finish today so I still can read when I'm tired, so —
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's not as comfortable -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: but you can do it. Very resilient.
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
THERAPIST: Let's stop there so we do have some time to do some relaxation. So next week we're on at 12:30.
CLIENT: Yes, yes, now I know. And I wrote out a check too.
THERAPIST: Okay. Take care of all of the logistics.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:37:36]
THERAPIST: (pause to [00:37:57) Thank you. 
Relaxation exercise from [00:38:00 to [00:44:39]
THERAPIST: I hope you got some relaxation from that.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's good for your body even if you don't get the sleep that you need.
CLIENT: Right. That's true.
THERAPIST: So I will let you carry that with you —
CLIENT: Good.
THERAPIST: and see you in a couple of weeks.
CLIENT: Sounds good. Thank you.
THERAPIST: You're very welcome. [00:44:52]
