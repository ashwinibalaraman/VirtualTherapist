<font size="4"><b>17: Parenting and Mental Health</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


This chapter will summarize theory and research on the impact of parental mental
health, broadly construed, and associated circumstances on parenting. A brief overview
of historical trends and theories in the domain of parenting research will be provided,
followed by a review of relevant research on personal and contextual influences on
parenting. This background will then be used as a basis for discussion concerning how
intervention programs and social policy can be directed toward mental health promotion
in the context of parenting.


A critical goal of many family-oriented mental health professionals is to maximize
the quality of relationships between parents and children. Understanding how to
modify these relationships requires answers to several questions. How does parental
psychological well-being hinder or enhance parenting? Which environmental influences
promote optimal parent-child interactions and relationships, and which interfere
with warm, supportive, and effective parenting? What types of prevention and intervention
programs can be developed to enhance healthy parenting, and how can social
policy initiatives support such programs?


<b>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES
ON PARENTING</b>


Decades of scientific inquiry about parenting
have yielded a wealth of information about the
impact of different parenting practices on child
health and development (for reviews, see
Bomstein, 1995). Surprisingly, theory and
research only more recently have begun to consider
the antecedents, or determinants, of parenting
- that is, <i>why</i> and <i>under what circumstances</i>
parents adopt particular caregiving styles. Three
major trends characterize the evolution of
knowledge about why parents engage in certain
types of parenting.


First, models of parenting have evolved from
exclusively person-centered to ecologically
based views that consider how certain circumstances
or contexts contribute to parenting.
These parenting contexts may range from macro-level
influences (such as living in poverty), to
micro-level processes (such as dealing with daily
stresses and strains), and may include sociocultural
factors (such as ethnicity or social class)
(Belsky, 1984; McLoyd, 1990). Understanding
how such contexts influence and are influenced
by the characteristics of parents has become an
increasingly important goal in elucidating the
determinants of parenting.


Second, models of parenting have matured from
unidimensional to multidimensional paradigms,

[p. <i>277</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00295&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Third, models of parenting have progressed
from a focus on parents as the sole agents of
socialization to a focus on the joint contributions
of parents and children (Belsky, 1984; Scarr,
1992; Eder and Mangelsdorf, 1997). These transactional
models consider the interactions or
'goodness of fit' between children and their caregivers
in predicting the nature of parent-child
relationships and child adjustment (Mangelsdorf
et al., 1990).


Inconsistency on the part of a parent, for
example, may be more detrimental to a child who
benefits from regularity and predictability than to
a child with an easygoing and flexible temperament.
Moreover, transactional models propose
that children actively <i>elicit</i> particular types of
parenting, resulting in reciprocal processes of
socialization (Belsky, 1984; Scarr, 1992; Darling
and Steinberg, 1993). For instance, a child with a
difficult temperament may evoke more controlling
behavior and harsher discipline from a parent.
Because the present focus lies on the characteristics
of parents and their contexts that guide
parenting, this third trend in research on parenting
will not be further broached.


<b>THEORIES AND
DIMENSIONS OF PARENTING</b>


Parenting involves a wide spectrum of goals,
behaviors, and interactions. Parents convey a set
of values, standards, and beliefs to children about
themselves and others, train children how to
express and regulate their emotions, transmit certain
styles of communication, model particular
behaviors, and teach a variety of skills, competencies,
and ways of interacting in the world.
Consequently, theories of parenting focus on a
range of dimensions through which parents
explicitly and implicitly influence their children,
including such features as the emotional climate
of the parent-child relationship, the provision of
instrumental support and guidance, and the use
of discipline practices designed to teach appropriate
behaviors. These dimensions typically
incorporate a combination of parent socialization
goals and values (such as the goal of raising a
compassionate child), particular parenting practices
(as in teaching a child to be empathic when
a friend is distressed), and a generalized parenting
style (for example, engaging in warm and
supportive parent-child interactions) (see
Darling and Steinberg, 1993).


Some theories of parenting focus primarily on
the emotional context of parent-child relationships.
For example, attachment theory holds that
parents who provide emotionally supportive caregiving,
characterized by warmth, sensitivity, nurturance,
and contingent responsiveness, cultivate
secure attachment with their children, which in
turn promotes positive developmental outcomes
(Bowlby, 1969; Ainswort et al., 1972). Other
theories of parenting (Baumrind, 1971; Maccoby
and Martin, 1983; Darling and Steinberg, 1993;
Skinner et al., 1998) expand on this perspective
by viewing parenting in terms of:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• affective dimension, characterized by
warmth, involvement, nurturance, and acceptance
versus rejection and criticism; and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• an instrumental dimension, characterized
by autonomy granting versus control and
discipline.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Control has been further differentiated into two
forms (Barber, 1996; Pomerantz and Ruble,
1998):
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• behavioral control, which involves efforts to
regulate children's behavior through guidance
and limit setting; and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• psychological control, which involves efforts
to regulate children's psychological development
through constraint of verbal or emotional
expression.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Understanding the impact of parental mental
health and associated contexts on parenting thus
requires a consideration of how these different
dimensions and processes of parenting may be
influenced.


• affective dimension, characterized by
warmth, involvement, nurturance, and acceptance
versus rejection and criticism; and


• an instrumental dimension, characterized
by autonomy granting versus control and
discipline.


• behavioral control, which involves efforts to
regulate children's behavior through guidance
and limit setting; and


• psychological control, which involves efforts
to regulate children's psychological development
through constraint of verbal or emotional
expression.

<b>PERSONAL AND CONTEXTUAL
INFLUENCES OW PARENTING</b>


<b><i>Parent Psychological Characteristics</i></b>


The psychological characteristics of parents are
likely to play a prominent role in parent socialization
goals and behaviors and in the quality of
parent-child relationships. Three characteristics
that have received attention in research on
parenting include: (a) personality and emotionality,
(b) social-cognitive processes, and (c) family
of origin experiences.


<b>PERSONALITY AND EMOTIONALITY</b>


Personality, by definition, is a relatively stable
and pervasive pattern of traits that influence
behavior. Thus, it is likely that parents' personalities
affect their parenting. Research on personality
and parenting has linked three major components
of personality - agreeableness or positive affectivity,
extraversion or sociability, and emotional
stability - with positive parenting. Specifically,
parents who are high in positive affectivity or
agreeableness have more positive interactions
with their children, are more warm, expressive,
sensitive, involved, responsive, and supportive
toward them, are more competent during interactions
with their children, and have a more positive
mood during parent-child interactions
(Belsky et al, 1995; Goldstein et al, 1996;
Szewczyk et al, 2001). In contrast, parents who
are low in agreeableness tend to show more negative
affect toward their children, to be more
controlling and less nurturing, and to foster less
secure attachment with their children
(Kochanska et al., 1987). Similarly, parents who
are extraverted tend to show more sensitivity,
positive affect, and cognitive stimulation with

[p. <i>279</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00297&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emotional stability and emotionality may
influence several aspects of parenting. Less emotionally
stable parents tend to overreact to negative
events or circumstances, such as their
children's misbehaviors (Belsky et al., 1995).
Even emotionally stable parents get moody at
times, however, and these transient moods may
influence parenting. Mood states may affect the
way parents view interactions with their children,
as well as how they respond to their children's
behaviors (Belsky et al., 1995). For example, sad
or angry moods may lead parents to attend less to
their parenting role, make inappropriately negative
attributions for their children's behavior, or
overreact to minor misbehaviors. Interestingly,
one parent's emotionality may be associated
with the other parent's child-rearing behavior. In
particular, recent research has revealed that positive
affect in fathers is the best predictor of
mothers' positive engagement with their children
(Szewczyk et al., 2001).


Although these findings touch on only a few
broad aspects of personality, the link between
personality and parenting is likely to hold for
more specific aspects of personality as well. For
example, parents with an internal locus of control
and a high sense of interpersonal trust
demonstrate more warm, accepting, respectful,
and helpful interactions with their children
(Mondell and Tyler, 1981). Furthermore,
because personality is so pervasive and is a
strong predictor of behavior, many other personality
attributes are likely to generalize to
parenting. For example, more responsible
adults are likely to be more responsible parents;
more insecure adults are likely to be less confident
in their parenting; more caring adults are
likely to be more caring as parents. In addition,
parents' personality and moods affect their parenting
not only indirectly, by influencing parenting
behaviors, but also directly, by providing
models of emotional expression and interactional
styles for their children. Research
demonstrates that parents' and children's levels
of emotionality are highly correlated (Bronstein
et al., 1993), suggesting that children may internalize
their parents' emotional displays.
Moreover, research indicates that the ways parents
express, regulate, and talk about emotions
shape their children's expression and regulation
of emotions (Eisenberg et al., 1996, 1998;
Parke and McDowell, 1998). Similarly, children
may learn ways of interacting with others
by modeling parent behaviors. Thus, parents'
personality and emotions may be transmitted
across generations through specific parenting
behaviors and through the quality of parent-child
interactions.


<b>SOCIAL-COGNITIVE PROCESSES</b>


Several models have been proposed to explain
the specific social-cognitive processes underlying
parenting behavior (see Bugental, 1993;
Crittenden, 1993; Milner, 1993; Strassberg,
1997). Consistently, this research indicates that
social information-processing systems, which
guide parents' attention, perception, interpretation,
and responses in the context of parent-child
interactions, are critical determinants of parenting
(for a review, see Werkerle and Wolfe, 1996).
Disturbances in social information processing
related to parenting may occur at several stages.
For example, parents may misperceive children's
needs or behaviors, make interpretive errors, and
fail to respond, or enact inappropriate responses,
leading to a range of maladaptive parenting
behaviors. Three particular aspects of social cognition
and information processing that have been
shown to influence parenting practices and
behaviors include attributions, perceived self-efficacy,
and coping styles.


Attributions involve judgments about the
intent of behaviors or the causes of particular
events. Typically, the tendency to attribute
negative behavior or events to internal, stable,
and global causes and to attribute positive behavior
or events to external, unstable, and specific
causes has been found to correlate with poorer
mental health (Tiggemann et al., 1992). In the
context of child rearing, parental attributions for
children's emotional states and behaviors are
associated with parental emotional arousal and
discipline practices. In particular, negative attributions
and appraisals of ambiguous child
misbehavior or noncompliance have been linked
to greater physiological arousal and feelings of
anger in response to the behavior (Dix and
Lochman, 1990; Slep and O'Leary, 1998), as well
as to harsh and coercive disciplinary practices
(Dix et al., 1989; Scott and Dembo, 1993; Smith
and O'Leary, 1995; Strassberg, 1997; Slep and
O'Leary, 1998; Nix et al., 1999).


At an extreme level, misattributions may leave
parents at risk for abusive parenting. For example,
research has shown that abusive parents
possess threat-oriented relationship schemas.
These schemas lead parents to be overly sensitive
to children's challenges to their authority
and to attribute high levels of power to their children,
which then results in aversive parenting
practices (Bugental, 1993). In contrast, parents
who more accurately perceive their children's
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, especially during
disagreements, are more likely to base their

[p. <i>280</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00298&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perceived self-efficacy involves personal evaluations
of one's ability to perform competently or
effectively in a particular environment (Bandura,
1995). A high level of perceived self-efficacy
fosters self-confidence, thereby promoting persistent
problem solving, optimistic predictions, high
expectancies for performance outcomes, and
active responses to stress (Bandura, 1995). High
self-efficacy has been linked to parenting competence
(Teti and Gelfand, 1991; Jackson and
Huang, 2000). In fact, it has been suggested that
self-efficacy may act as a buffer against difficult
child temperaments and may represent a final
common pathway in predicting parenting sensitivity
(Teti et al., 1996). When self-efficacy is
diminished, minor parenting hassles or child noncompliance
might overwhelm one's parenting
capabilities, causing caregiving to be interpreted
as an unmanageable and distressing task and creating
diminished parental involvement, warmth,
and sensitivity. In addition to affecting parenting
behavior directly, self-efficacy beliefs may influence
other social information-processing mechanisms
that guide parenting. For instance, parents
with low self-efficacy may overestimate children's
power or misattribute misbehavior to
parental incompetence, which may interfere further
with parenting processes.


Coping styles also may contribute to parenting
beliefs and behavior. Whereas proactive coping,
which involves approaching and dealing directly
with adversity, has been linked to positive mental
health, avoidance coping, which involves cognitive
and behavioral efforts aimed at escaping from
adversity, has been linked to mental health difficulties
(Endler et al, 1993; Kohn et al, 1994).
Coping efforts are likely to influence parent-child
interactions and parenting behaviors (Kurtz and
Derevensky, 1994). For instance, problem-focused
coping is associated with increased perceived control
in the parenting role, more parental warmth,
and more authoritative parenting (Holloway and
Machida, 1991). An active approach to child-rearing
challenges may therefore enhance adaptive parenting.
Alternative coping responses that involve distancing,
escaping, and avoiding are associated with
parental distress, which in rum interferes with
effective discipline practices (Holloway and
Machida, 1991; Tein et al, 2000).


<b>FAMILY OF ORIGIN EXPERIENCES</b>


A comprehensive picture of the personal determinants
of parenting requires a consideration of
how parents' own history and experiences in the
context of parent-child and other close relationships
influence their parenting. How does the
experience of an insecure attachment relationship,
a history of abuse, or exposure to parentchild
or marital conflict during one's own
childhood affect subsequent parenting beliefs
and behavior?


Child-rearing patterns tend to remain consistent
across generations. This intergenerational
transmission of parenting may in part reflect
common genetic forces that shape interpersonal
behavior. However, early experiences within
interpersonal relationships may play a crucial
role in forming the basis for beliefs, emotional
experience and regulation, and ways of interacting
in future relationships. That is, internal representations
or schemas of intimate relationships
that originate within early family relationships
may be reactivated in parents' relationships with
their own children (Lyons-Ruth, 1992). Consistent
with this view, the security of attachment
between parents and their children has been
demonstrated to remain somewhat consistent
across generations (Fonagy et al., 1991; Lyons-Ruth
et al, 1996). These representations of
relationships may form a database of stored
information that guides ongoing information processing
and emotion regulation in the parenting
context, thereby driving the types of social-cognitive
and emotional influences on parenting
described earlier. Indeed, parents' experience
within their family of origin has been found to be
one of the strongest contributors to parenting
(Cox et al, 1985; Belsky et al, 1986; Elder et al.,
1986; Lyons-Ruth, 1992).


<b><i>Parents' Psychological Distress
and Mental Illness</i></b>


A considerable amount of research has examined
the implications of psychological disorders in
parents for parenting and child development. A
variety of parenting processes may be compromised
by severe and chronic parental mental
illness, as well as by more mild and transient
forms of psychological distress.


<b>DEPRESSION</b>


Maternal depression is one of the most widely
studied influences on parenting (for reviews, see
Beardslee et al., 1983; Gelfand and Teti, 1990;
Gotlib and Hammen, 1992; Hammen and
Rudolph, 1996; Cicchetti et al., 1998; Radke-Yarrow,
1998; Cummings and Davies, 1999;
Goodman and Gotlib, 1999). Depressive symptoms
may range from mild feelings of sadness

[p. <i>281</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00299&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not surprisingly, depression is associated with
problematic parenting behavior and maladaptive
parent-child interactions. One might imagine multiple
pathways through which depression interferes
with parenting competence. For example, feelings
of sadness or flat affect may be reflected in
impaired emotional expression and regulation
within parent-child interactions; hopelessness and
low self-worth may diminish parenting self-efficacy
and thus cause frustration with, or disengagement
from, the parenting role; a heightened
self-focus may hinder contingent responsiveness,
reciprocal interactions, effective communication,
and joint problem solving; irritability may result in
decreased warmth and sensitivity and increased
criticism; and fatigue may lead to inconsistent
responses, lack of guidance or limit setting, and
withdrawal. Indeed, depression in mothers has
been linked to negative affect and irritability, criticism,
insensitivity, and poor conflict resolution
during parent-child interactions. Depression also
has been found to be associated with maternal disengagement,
as reflected in decreased verbalization
and responsiveness to children's speech and
diminished involvement and provision of structure
(Radke-Yarrow et al, 1985; Hops et al, 1987;
Kochanska et al, 1987; Gordon et al, 1989; Field
et al., 1990; Goodman and Brumley, 1990; Teti
et al., 1996; for reviews, see Hammen, 1991;
Gotlib and Hammen, 1992).


Depressed parents also may convey negative
messages to children about themselves and the
world, either through modeling or through the
type of feedback they provide to children. For
example, negative attributions, low self-worth,
and hopelessness - characteristics of depressed
individuals - may be adopted by the offspring of
depressed parents (Garber and Flynn, 2001).
Moreover, parental feedback and explanations of
child-focused events are associated with children's
attributions, suggesting that children learn
to interpret events based on parents' beliefs
(Garber and Flynn, 2001).


<b>ANXIETY</b>


Experiences of anxiety may range in severity
from the worries of everyday life to extreme
levels of nervousness, physiological arousal, and
inhibited behavior or avoidance that are
characteristic of clinical disorders. Furthermore,
anxiety may assume multiple forms. For example,
anxiety may involve general worries about
many areas of one's life, often accompanied by
physical symptoms such as muscle tension, restlessness,
and sleeplessness. Alternatively, anxiety
may be circumscribed to particular situations,
such as performance and social situations, or to
particular objects. At extreme levels, anxiety
may be severely debilitating, as in the case of
agoraphobia, which is characterized by an
intense fear and avoidance of situations in which
immediate escape may be difficult, or obsessive-compulsive
disorder, which is characterized by
recurrent intrusive thoughts and rituals. In such
cases, anxiety may interfere with day-to-day
functioning across multiple roles, including the
parenting role.


Once again, a range of parenting processes may
be disrupted by the presence of anxiety in parents.
For instance, generalized anxiety may lead to
overly protective and cautious parenting styles
(Capps et al, 1996); preoccupation with one's
own worries or physical symptoms may interfere
with engagement in consistent and warm interactions
with children (Fellow-Smith, 2000); even
circumscribed anxiety, such as a fear of social
situations, may impair parents' ability to actively
engage in the parenting role by restricting activities
such as attendance at school or social events
(Fellow-Smith, 2000). The type of disruptions in
parenting that occur will likely depend on the
form and severity of parental anxiety.


Although empirical evidence is scarce concerning
the influence of parental anxiety on particular
parenting processes, research supports the
presence of parenting and parent-child relationship
difficulties in anxious parents. In terms of
direct effects on parenting, anxious parents
respond less warmly and positively to their children,
allow their children less independence, and
express more critical child-directed comments
(Whaley et al., 1999). Anxious parents have been
shown to minimize communication with their
children and to discourage children's expression
of thoughts and ideas, thus inhibiting the development
of emotional ties and causing feelings of
disappointment and dejection in children (Rao
and Ram, 1984). Research also has demonstrated
less secure attachment in the children of anxious
parents (Manassis et al., 1995). Even moderate
levels of anxiety may affect parenting. For example,
one study demonstrated that parents who
worried about their children's academic performance
were more likely to engage in intrusive-support
practices that undermined children's
autonomy (Pomerantz and Eaton, 2001).

[p. <i>282</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00300&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anxious parents also may model maladaptive
cognitive styles and problematic behaviors that
reflect their fears and insecurities. Anxious
mothers report diminished confidence in their child-earing
competence and coping in response to
child-elated stresses (Barnett and Parker, 1986).
These decreased perceptions of efficacy may then
be adopted by children. Indeed, anxious parents
appear to transmit their lower levels of perceived
control and lack of global optimism to their children;
such modeling may help to explain the
intergenerational transmission of anxiety within
families (Capps et al., 1996). These preliminary
studies indicate the presence of a range of parenting
difficulties in individuals with anxiety.


<b>SCHIZOPHRENIA/PSYCHOSIS</b>


Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders
typically begin during the child-bearing and
early child-rearing years and are characterized by
a severe and chronic course of debilitating
thoughts and behaviors. Thus, these disorders
may have serious consequences for parenting.
Some symptoms involve decreases in typical
behaviors, such as flat affect, decreased speech,
and decreased motion. Such symptoms may
affect parents' ability to communicate with their
children, display affection, foster intimacy, and
provide children with age-appropriate stimulation.
Other symptoms involve the appearance of
atypical behaviors and experiences, such as
hallucinations and unusual beliefs. These symptoms
may limit parents' capacity to appropriately
socialize their children. For example, delusional
parents may model maladaptive belief systems to
their children, who may then adopt these beliefs
into their own thinking (Seeman, 1996). Indeed,
studies consistently have indicated that individuals
with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders
exhibit significantly more parenting difficulties
compared to parents without a mental illness. For
example, mothers with schizophrenia have been
found to be more withdrawn and emotionally uninvolved
during interactions with their children
(Cohler et al., 1977; Goodman and Brumley, 1990).


Schizophrenia and psychosis in parents also
may exert indirect effects on parenting. For
example, as we will discuss later, supportive
marital relationships and a strong parenting
alliance play an important role in promoting
adaptive parenting. One parent's support in the
marital relationship may be particularly important
as a buffer against the other parent's mental
illness. Yet, severe mental illness may pose serious
challenges to establishing and maintaining
positive marital relationships, thus decreasing
the likelihood of a stable family environment.


<b>SUBSTANCE ABUSE</b>


Research has consistently demonstrated the
negative effects of substance use and addiction on
parenting. Alcohol consumption and addiction
have been found to be associated with a wide
range of cognitive deficits and maladaptive
behaviors, such as impairment in perceptualmotor
skills, difficulties with appropriate emotional
expression, and deficits in problem solving
(Sparadeo et al., 1983; Eliason and Skinstad,
1995), which have substantial implications for
interpersonal functioning and child rearing. For
example, alcohol intoxication influences parents'
judgments of child misbehaviors and adversely
affects parental efficacy in managing children
(Lang et al., 1999). Alcoholism has been associated
with inconsistent discipline, poor monitoring
of child behavior, and decreased nurturance and
emotional availability. Of further detriment to
parent-child relations, alcoholic parents tend to
value and use corporal punishment, exhibit less
empathy for their children's needs, and hold
inappropriate expectations of their children.
Alcoholic parents also tend to engage in frequent
parent-child role reversals (Gallant et al., 1998).
Similarly, drug-dependent mothers display less
responsive, more negative, and more rejecting
parenting behaviors than do non-substance abusing
parents (Hans et al., 1999).


Parental substance abuse also exerts indirect
effects on parenting and parent-child relationships.
For instance, engaging in substance use
models ineffective coping strategies and other
problem behaviors to children (Windle, 1996)
and undermines parents' ability to maintain a
household or adequate employment. Substance
use also interferes with the capacity to maintain
positive marital relations and a healthy home
environment (Windle, 1996). Moreover, substance-dependent
parents are likely to invest
much of their time and resources into obtaining
and consuming substances, thus neglecting their
parenting role. In sum, substance use itself, combined
with a compromised family environment
and a failure to allocate adequate time and
money to the act of parenting, are likely to have
serious consequences for parenting and child
well-being.


<b>ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY</b>


The essential feature of antisocial behavior and
personality is disregard for and violation of the
rights of others, including deception and manipulation,
perpetration of criminal acts, and failure
to conform to social norms. Antisocial individuals
tend to be impulsive, irresponsible, and aggressive,
and have difficulty empathizing with the

[p. <i>283</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00301&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because optimal parenting requires parents to
exhibit empathy and to anticipate the needs of
their children, antisocial behavior and personality
are likely to have detrimental effects on parenting.
For instance, studies have revealed that
mothers with antisocial personality traits typically
display unresponsive parenting (Cassidy
et al., 1996) and ineffective monitoring of
children's activities (Patterson and Capaldi,
1991). Moreover, individuals with antisocial
personality traits exhibit excessively punitive
disciplinary tactics with children, which increase
the likelihood of child abuse and injury (Wolfe,
1987).


Antisocial characteristics also may influence
the societal context in which parents and children
interact. Because parents with antisocial
personality traits may engage in a wide range of
destructive and potentially criminal behaviors,
they may be incarcerated and thus separated
from their children. Furthermore, antisocial
parents may model criminal and aggressive
behaviors, leading to poor socialization and consequent
antisocial behaviors on the part of the
child.


<b><i>Contexts of Parenting</i></b>


A comprehensive model of parenting and mental
health requires an ecological perspective that
situates parenting within the broader context
of people's lives. This perspective considers
how contextual factors directly and indirectly
influence the process of parenting. Other chapters
in this volume consider wider contexts of
parenting, such as social and economic adversity
and culturally divergent settings. Here we consider
the influence of proximal contexts within
and outside of the family, including chronic
strains and daily stresses created by parental
employment and marital conflict or divorce, as
well as the impact of general stresses and social
support networks on parenting. This contextual
perspective considers how the multiple roles that
parents need to negotiate in their daily lives may
pose challenges to their parenting.


<b>PARENTAL EMPLOYMENT</b>


Parents' jobs, although they contribute to the
financial resources of the family, also may
add stress to family dynamics. Many parents
deal with stressful, emotional, demanding, or
high-pressure jobs, or face conflict in their work
environments. These and other stresses associated
with parental employment often carry over
into family life, possibly contributing to family
conflict and undermining adaptive parenting.
Parents with high levels of work-related stress
are likely to evidence their stress in strained
parenting interactions. For example, they may
express more negative affect with their children
(Repetti, 1994), use harsh, coercive, or disruptive
disciplinary tactics, such as yelling, hitting,
and severe punishment (Almeida et al., 1999), or
withdraw from parenting physically (such as by
speaking less or paying less attention to children)
and emotionally (such as by expressing less
affection, or appearing less caring and loving)
(Repetti and Wood, 1997).


In addition to the 'spillover' effect (Repetti
and Wood, 1997, p. 92) of work stress into
parenting, research implicates participation in
multiple roles as a contributor to mental health
difficulties, such as depression and anxiety, in
both men and women (Repetti et al., 1989;
Greenberger and O'Neil, 1993; Windle and
Dumenci, 1997). That is, the more roles parents
have to balance, the fewer physical and emotional
resources they have available to devote to
parenting. Despite some support for the negative
effect of multiple roles, there is also evidence
that, in some instances, multiple roles may
buffer parents from stress and psychological distress
(e.g. Sprock and Yoder, 1997). In fact,
employment that is valued and that offers social
support actually may increase mental health and
life satisfaction (Pleck, 1985; Repetti et al.,
1989), which may exert a positive influence on
parenting.


What, then, determines whether employment
will have positive or negative consequences for
parenting and mental health? The impact of
employment may depend on multiple factors,
such as parents' level of participation in their
roles (such as time at work versus time necessary/
available for parenting), commitment to and satisfaction
with these roles, and support in these
roles (such as shared parenting responsibilities)
(Greenberger and O'Neil, 1993). The consequences
of employment may also depend on the
intensity of parenting demands, which are higher
for younger, multiple, and special-needs children.
Thus, although stress at work can carry over into
stress at home, it does not always do so. Responses
will depend on a combination of individual
circumstances, including the nature and supportiveness
of home and work environments, and
various psychological factors, including parents'
values, attitudes, and coping styles.

<b>MARITAL QUALITY AND DIVORCE</b>


Marital satisfaction and closeness are related
both to positive mental health and to effective
parenting (Cox et al., 1989; Deal et al, 1989). A
close, engaging, and satisfying marriage may
encourage a parent's investment or involvement
in parenting, as well as improve the quality of
parenting by increasing child-directed warmth,
responsiveness, support, sensitivity, and positive
attitudes, and by decreasing hostility (Cox et al,
1989; Floyd et al., 1998; Szewczyk et al., 2001).
This pattern, in turn, should facilitate more
secure parent-child attachment and more positive
child outcomes (Frosch et al., 2000; Frosch
and Mangelsdorf, 2001). Furthermore, parents
who unite in a parenting alliance - by co-parenting
with equal involvement and commitment, providing
mutual support and agreement over parenting
strategies and expectations, and respecting each
other's parental roles - also tend to individually
parent in consistent, confident, competent, and
effective ways (Deal et al, 1989; Mahoney et al.,
1997; Floyd et al., 1998).


Conversely, parents in conflictual, distressed,
or dissatisfying marriages are likely to exhibit a
variety of maladaptive parenting practices,
including a lax disciplinary style, decreased
acceptance of children's assertiveness, and more
unreasonable commands. They also tend to display
more negative affect toward their children,
have stressful or tense interactions with their
children, and even reject or withdraw from their
parenting role (Bond and McMahon, 1984;
Fauber et al., 1990; Kerig et al., 1993; Almeida
et al, 1999). Marital conflict also undermines
parental warmth, support, and emotional availability,
thus leading to less secure parent-child
attachment (Frosch et al., 2000). In terms of the
parenting alliance, marital discord disrupts parents'
ability to establish respectful, supportive,
consistent patterns of co-parenting, which in turn
detracts from warm and involved parenting
(Floyd et al., 1998). Finally, some research indicates
that parenting itself may have adverse
consequences for marital satisfaction (Almeida
et al., 1999), suggesting a bi-directional, or even
cyclical, relation between parenting stress and
marital stress. Thus, the harmony of marital relations
seems to be integral to parenting.


In addition to direct effects of marital quality
on parenting, the former may influence the latter
through its impact on parental mental health.
Although marriage is associated with lower rates
of psychological distress overall (Gotlib and
Hammen, 1992), marriage with conflict or low
levels of satisfaction and cohesion is linked to
compromised mental health, including a higher
incidence of depression, anxiety, and substance
abuse problems (Windle and Dumenci, 1997;
Whisman, 1999). This relation also appears to be
bi-directional: higher marital dissatisfaction and
conflict predict onset of mental health problems,
and mental health problems predict marital dissatisfaction
and conflict (Gotlib and Hammen,
1992).


In some cases, serious marital discord may end
in divorce. Stress associated with divorce often
leaves parents less physically and emotionally
available for their children (for reviews, see
Hines, 1997; Hetherington et al., 1998). The
stress of divorce is associated with both physical
and psychological health risks in parents, such as
medical problems, depression, anxiety, anger,
loneliness, impulsivity, and substance use. These
problems, in turn, are likely to undermine
parental perceptions of competence and to
increase apprehension about parenting efficacy,
leading to compromised parenting, as discussed
earlier (Hines, 1997; Hethermgton et al., 1998)
(see also chapter 8).


In addition to its effects on parental mental
health, divorce disrupts family dynamics and
resources, which inevitably compromises the
divorced couple's parenting. For example, parents
who separate no longer have an alliance to
discipline and parent their children together,
which increases the opportunity for inconsistent
parenting (Hines, 1997). Divorced parents also
tend to remain in conflict with one another,
which may make them more irritable, less supportive,
and less involved in their parenting roles
(Hetherington et al., 1998). Specifically, divorced
mothers show parenting difficulties in control
and assignment of household tasks, whereas
divorced fathers tend to have problems with
communication, self-disclosure, and monitoring
their children's activities (Hetherington et al.,
1998).


Despite the range and depth of parenting problems
associated with divorce, the effects of
divorce are not all negative. First, unsatisfied and
argumentative parents who stay together, rather
than divorce, foster a hostile, unsupportive
parenting environment that may have worse
parenting consequences than a divorce (Hines,
1997). Second, although rocky at first, parenting
practices and family relationships tend to stabilize
within two years of divorce (Hetherington
et al., 1998). Third, although divorce often is associated
with problems both in parental mental
health and in parenting, this is not always the
case. For example, divorced parents who co-parent
their children in their dual residences tend to
have more positive outcomes (Hetherington
et al., 1998). In addition, although many
parenting practices change during the divorce

[p. <i>285</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00303&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>STRESS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT</b>


Beyond the challenges of employment and marital
relationships, parents face a variety of stresses
in their everyday lives, including the stress of
parenting itself. Although parenting, for many, is
a rewarding and fulfilling life experience, it also
may be stressful, and this stress can have a negative
impact on personal well-being and parenting.
Some research finds that parents may be less
happy and satisfied with their lives, worry more,
and experience higher levels of psychological
distress than non-parenting adults (McLanahan
and Adams, 1987; Bird, 1997). Parenting tends
to be particularly stressful and to be associated
with more severe psychological distress in the
context of children with special needs (Teti et al.,
1996), young children (Oyserman et al., 2000),
and children who are perceived as more demanding
or less reinforcing (Kwok and Wong, 2000).
The strains of parenting can, therefore, heighten
psychological distress and undermine functional
parent-child relationships and family interaction
(Patterson, 1983; Crnic and Greenberg, 1990).
More general stress in other areas of parents' lives
also appears to lead to maladaptive parenting
styles such as negativism, criticism, and irritability
(Burge and Hammen, 1991; Conger et al., 1992).


Social support systems may buffer the impact
of stressful contexts on both parental mental
health and parenting. Social support in the context
of parenting may involve a range of
processes, including the provision of emotional
support (love, empathy, encouragement, understanding,
and advice); instrumental support (concrete
assistance with tasks, such as parenting,
childcare, and household tasks); informational
support (such as advice or information concerning
parenting or childcare); and economic support
(giving concrete material help) (Cochran
and Niego, 1995; Henly, 1997).


Social support can help parents cope with difficult
life circumstances, such as employment
demands and marital conflict or divorce (Sprock
and Yoder, 1997), which in turn may alleviate
parenting difficulties and parental distress. In
addition to these indirect effects, much research
indicates a direct positive effect of social support
on the psychological well-being of parents (see
Belsky, 1984) and on parenting skills (Taylor
and Roberts, 1995; Henly, 1997). Certain aspects
of support - particularly emotional and instrumental
support - are most strongly associated
with maternal well-being and positive parenting
skills. Specifically, a parent's level of social support
predicts a stronger sense of competence in
the caregiving role, more parental responsiveness
and nurturance, and decreased restrictiveness,
punitiveness, and hostility (for reviews, see
Belsky, 1984; McLoyd, 1990). Of course, the
types and levels of support that are most beneficial
will vary from parent to parent, and from situation
to situation.


However, some forms of social 'support' may
create conflict or stress. For example, intergenerational
or extended-family networks may offer
parenting support and advice, but when family
members disagree about child-rearing beliefs
and practices, these networks may become more
distressing and undermining than helpful
(Cochran and Niego, 1995; Sonuga-Barke et al.,
1998). In fact, a key element in determining the
benefit provided by social networks is the goodness
of fit between parents and their networks, in
terms of ideological views, expectations, and
practices, as well as in the level and quality of
support desired and provided (see Belsky, 1984).


<i><b>Commentary: Personal and
Contextual Influences on Parenting Processes</b></i>


A burgeoning body of research points to multiple
influences on parenting, including processes
associated with psychological characteristics of
parents, parental psychological distress and mental
illness, and contextual factors. Yet, many
challenges and questions need to be addressed to
construct a comprehensive picture of parenting
and mental health. Here we highlight a few
neglected or only recently emerging areas of
study: (1) the impact on parenting of varying
degrees of parental psychological distress and
mental illness; (2) the particular impact of fathers'
mental health on parenting processes and practices,
and; (3) the mediational role of parenting
contexts in the path from psychological well-being
to parenting.


Much research on parenting and mental health
focuses on severe cases of mental illness that
incapacitate parents, rather than on more common
mental health challenges that parents face
from time to time. Mild symptoms of psychological
distress, such as transitory depression and
anxiety, are often left untreated and accepted as

[p. <i>286</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00304&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although research on normative parenting
processes has begun to examine the specific role
of fathering (Pleck, 1995), research on father-hood
and mental health is relatively limited.
Recent changes in paternal roles (such as becoming
more involved in parenting) have put strains
on fathers that seem to increase their psychological
distress (Dickstein et al., 1991; Pleck and
Pleck, 1997). Paternal psychological distress, in
turn, is likely to alter family relationships and to
strain family resources. For example, a few studies
have begun to illuminate the specific consequences
of mental illness in fathers. These
investigations have revealed that difficulties such
as depression and substance abuse in fathers are
linked to problematic parent-child interactions
and less secure attachment in children (for a
review, see Phares and Compas, 1993). To date,
studies of fathering have focused on mental
health difficulties more common among men,
such as substance abuse and antisocial behavior,
and on employment stress, and thus additional
research is needed on the impact of other psychological
and contextual difficulties on fathering.


Despite parental mental illness and parenting
contexts being frequently studied topics,
researchers are only now beginning to link them
together explicitly. It is important to note that
psychological distress and mental illness may
affect parenting not only through the direct
expression of symptoms, but also through the
contexts or circumstances of a person's life (such
as employment, finances, and romantic relationships).
Severe depression, debilitating anxiety,
psychosis, substance abuse, and antisocial behavior
all may be associated with impairments in
living that have significant ramifications for an
individual's parenting capacity. For example,
antisocial personality frequently is associated
with criminal behaviors considered punishable
and subject to incarceration. Such behaviors and
the consequent separations from one's family
may have serious consequences for parenting.
Likewise, anxiety and depression may interfere
with marital quality and satisfaction. Thus, mental
health difficulties not only have a direct effect
on parenting processes, but also have an indirect
effect through their impact on the family environment.
Paradoxically, treatment of severe
mental illness, in some cases, may pose serious
challenges to an individual's parenting abilities.
For example, severe mental illness may necessitate
psychiatric hospitalization, resulting in the parents'
separation from their children. Also, medication
commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of
mental illness may seriously impair parents'
capacity through deleterious side-effects (Anthony
and McGinnis, 1978). Medication and other treatment
also can be quite costly, in terms of both
time and money, and further diminish family
resources. Thus, it is important to consider the
effects of intervention in the further exacerbation
of parenting difficulties.


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR
PRACTICE: INTERVENTION
AND SOCIAL POLICY</b>


Knowing that parental mental health and parenting
are intricately related, an essential issue
becomes how to address problems in these
areas. To do this, we may benefit once again
from an ecological perspective. Within such a
framework, multiple levels of parents' personal
resources and environments must be addressed to
contribute to their mental health and parenting
needs. At the individual level, prevention and
intervention programs targeted at parents and
their children can be tailored to address particular
parenting and mental health issues. At an
intermediate level, social support networks,
friends, and extended family members can offer
an additional layer of support. At a more broadbased
level, local resources, such as schools and
community centers, may provide group-focused
programs for parenting and mental health issues.
And finally, at a large-scale level, social policy
may help to address parenting and mental health
issues in ways that directly or indirectly benefit
parents and families. Each of these levels of
influence, alone or in combination, can be a
focus for addressing the issues in parenting and
mental health that we discussed earlier. Possible
goals and practices that can be incorporated into
these intervention approaches are described
below.


<i><b>Individual Approaches</b></i>


As already seen, parents with mental health concerns
face many challenges in their parenting
roles. Depending on the severity and context of
these challenges, one or a combination of several
parent-centered intervention methods may be
appropriate. These include teaching basic parenting

[p. <i>287</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00305&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Parents who are coping with psychological or
environmental stresses may seek assistance with
their parenting skills. Programs can help parents
to address specific aspects of their child-rearing
interactions, such as emotional engagement,
responsiveness, discipline, and dealing with
issues of control and autonomy (Puckering et al.,
1994; Luthar and Suchman, 2000). Beyond
building child-rearing knowledge and skills,
some programs focus on the parent-child pair,
and thus seek directly to enhance parent-child
interactions and relationship capacities, such as
attachment quality, positive interactions, and
dealing with negative emotions (Oyserman et al.,
1994; Clark et al., 1998). These programs may
offer structured time and opportunities for parents
to have positive, enjoyable interactions with
their children, with the supportive guidance of
care providers. Nurses or other assistants often
help parents to engage with their children (such
as by establishing eye contact or fostering communication)
and to respond to children's cues
and needs. Beyond fostering positive contact
between parents and children, these <i>in vivo</i> interactions
provide an optimal setting for building
parenting skills, by allowing mental-health
workers to assess parenting strengths and weaknesses,
provide supervision, training, and guidance
in the immediate parenting context, and
model appropriate parenting skills for parents to
implement (Oyserman et al., 1994).


Although many parenting programs work
directly on enhancing parenting skills and interactions,
other programs focus on improving
parents' mental health, and thus indirectly on
fostering better child-rearing skills. Programs
may address particular mental health issues
(such as through psychotherapy for depression or
anxiety, or treatment for substance abuse), as
well as their impact on parenting, using a variety
of therapeutic approaches. Several of these
approaches draw on current understanding of
parenting processes, such as those reviewed earlier
in the chapter. For example, in line with
evidence supporting the influence of information-processing
deficits on parenting, cognitive-behavioral
approaches to parenting interventions
are specifically designed to address maladaptive
social-cognitive processes, such as low self-efficacy,
negative attributions, and coping
difficulties (Clark et al., 1998). In a recently developed
program for abusive parents, an attribution-retraining
approach is used to target parents'
maladaptive attributions about their children, rather
than specific parenting behaviors. This intervention
has demonstrated parenting improvements beyond
support-based home visitation programs (Bugental,
2001). Success of this type of program highlights
the importance of integrating research on the
determinants of parenting into intervention
efforts.


Other programs address the interpersonal context
of parenting and mental health. Interpersonal
approaches are designed to restructure parents'
negative self-schemas, negative expectations, and
negative emotional expression, particularly
within the parenting relationship (Klerman, et al.,
1995; Clark et al, 1998). Drawing again from
research on the determinants of parenting, inter-personal
approaches also may involve exploring
the parents' family of origin and its impact on
current parent-child and family relationships.
For example, programs may attempt to modify
maladaptive internal models of relationships in
parents who lacked effective role models, such
as those who grew up with abusive or neglectful
parents (Nicholson and Blanch, 1994).


More intensive types of intervention may be
required for parents with severe mental illness.
These parents may undergo chronic or episodic
hospitalization, and thus may lose consistent
contact with their children. In some cases, legal
authorities may deem mentally ill parents too
incompetent, neglectful, or mentally unstable to
look after their children, and may remove them
from their custody. These approaches take a
deficit approach to parenting and mental health
that focuses on parents' incompetence. In contrast,
some programs take a skill-development
approach that bolsters parenting skills and confidence.
For example, residential treatment centers
or home-visit programs allow parents to continue
parenting under the supervision of mental health
providers, who not only can address their mental
health needs, but also can assess and help
develop their parenting skills and confidence
(Oyserman et al, 1994). In addition to skill-building,
the educational component of these
programs may provide information on child
development, health care, and educational needs.
For parents who are severely incapacitated by
mental illness, these programs may further assist
with or teach them about maintaining a household,
obtaining and preparing food, and providing
for children's health and hygiene. Furthermore,
programs may offer contingency planning or
respite care services during hospitalization or
acute symptom phases for parents who experience
periods of severe mental illness.


Although quite varied in approach and content,
parent-centered interventions, in general, recognize
the social-cognitive and interpersonal contributors
to mental health and parenting difficulties,

[p. <i>288</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00306&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Group or Network Approaches</b></i>


Programs that take a broader ecological approach
may extend resources to include social support
networks. Whether by tapping into existing
resources, such as spouses, other family members,
and neighbors, or helping to build new
social support networks, such as through parent
support groups, this approach helps parents to
reduce their sense of isolation and to cope with
the challenges of parenting.


Although many individual intervention programs
focus solely on the parent with mental
health issues, family-oriented interventions may
include both spouses and even other family
members. These programs are helpful in addressing
the broader contexts of parenting, such as
possible marital issues or family stresses
contributing to mental health and parenting
problems, and may provide marital or family
therapy if relevant. Spouses or other family
members also may seek education on relevant
mental health issues (for example, learning
about depression, or understanding the impact of
anxiety on parenting) and may learn ways to
cope with mental illness in the family. These
approaches encourage supportive spouse and
family interactions as a therapeutic tool. As such,
these programs may help foster communication,
connectedness, support, and joint problemsolving
between parenting pairs or other family
members (Beardslee et al., 1992, 1997; Goldstein
and Miklowitz, 1995; Clark et al., 1998), thereby
addressing some of the parenting processes that
are compromised by a conflictual or unsupportive
family environment. Family intervention
approaches appear to be quite successful for
parents with depression (Beardslee et al., 1992,
1997; Clark et al., 1998) and schizophrenia
(Goldstein and Miklowitz, 1995).


Group interventions are likely to have a didactic
component similar to individual interventions
(such as learning about parenting interactions,
skills, and resources), but they also provide
opportunities for parents to exchange experiences,
coping strategies, and parenting ideas with others,
and to build mutual support networks with
parents facing similar difficulties. Although
research on the efficacy of such group intervention
approaches is limited, one group therapy
program documented improvements in a few of
the targeted parenting behaviors (including
affective interactions and parenting satisfaction),
but not others (including limit setting and autonomy)
(Luthar and Suchman, 2000).


<i><b>Community Approaches</b></i>


Some researchers advocate more broadly
focused parenting interventions that involve
community resources, or are delivered within
community settings. Community-based service
programs come in many forms, with varying
agendas, methods, and outcomes. What they
have in common is a focus on parenting <i>in context</i>,
within the community. Ecologically based
or community programs may aim to increase
social support networks, involve parents in community
resources, and even address the needs of
particular socio-cultural groups (Golding, 2000)
or parents with particular circumstances, such as
teen parents, single parents, or divorced parents
(Goodman, 1984). By working with parents in
their communities, these programs may foster
peer support, reduce feelings of isolation, and
empower parents to make contacts with and
engage in local community resources.


Although rare, some programs establish connections
and foster communication between
parents and schools or daycare services, and even
help to arrange for these services. Community
intervention programs could be very helpful in
assisting parents in building relationships with
service providers (for example, pediatricians,
teachers, school counselors) and social networks
(such as neighbors, other parents). Unfortunately,
though, this level of support is rarely included in
parenting intervention programs. In a review of
community mental health services for parents
with mental illness, Oyserman et al. (1994) state
that 'environmental supports outside the home
were not considered, and treatment did not
include development of natural support systems
to provide informational, emotional, or instrumental
assistance after the crisis' (p. 138).


In addition to helping individual parents
within community contexts, community-based
programs may address parenting issues on a
large scale, by delivering services to many
parents and even taking a preventive approach.
Whereas many individual- and family-based
programs assist parents with evidenced difficulties

[p. <i>289</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00307&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although little research has tested the efficacy
of community approaches to parenting and mental
health, some claim that they are just as effective
as individually focused programs (Golding,
2000). Certainly, both individual- and community-based
programs have advantages, and one may
be more beneficial than the other for particular
circumstances and goals. A combination of individual
and community approaches, though, may
be most effective in addressing issues of parenting
and mental health. Indeed, some service
providers and health policy-makers have advocated
such a multi-level model that integrates
individual approaches (addressing parents'
psychological and parenting needs), family and
group approaches (attempting to improve interactions
between parents and children; building
on family and social support networks), and
community approaches (helping parents to utilize
local mental health services and school and
daycare resources) (Luthar and Suchman, 2000).
Furthermore, a tiered service model may draw on
resources from many levels, including direct
service providers, such as health visitors and
general practitioners, professional consultants,
such as mental-health specialists who can offer
support, training, and consultation to service
providers, and, in some cases, physical services,
such as social welfare, health care services, and
daycare personnel (Day and Davies, 1999). This
type of collaborative approach would allow
parents to gain support in their immediate surroundings,
while benefiting from the expertise and
services of more specialized programs.


<i><b>Commentary: Recommendations
for Service Providers and Social Policy</b></i>


Both basic research on parenting and analysis
of current interventions point to a few key
themes and recommendations regarding service
delivery for parenting difficulties. First, parenting
interventions should have a clear theoretical
foundation, specific goals, specific treatment
objectives and techniques focused on particular
parenting behaviors, and clarity in applying
those concepts to the treatment approaches
(Clark et al., 1998). Second, a whole-parent
model of intervention should address not only
specific parenting difficulties and mental illness
but also the potentially stressful contexts of parenting,
and should build strengths, motivation,
skills, and knowledge in a way that fits with
those contexts or circumstances. Such programs
should take into account the familial, social, and
environmental contexts of parenting (such as
employment, financial status, marital problems,
and social support), and should respond to individual
parents' and families' needs and circumstances
(Warfield et al., 2000). Third, several
researchers recommend moving away from a
deficit or disorder model of parenting and mental
health (that is, viewing parents as incompetent
and needing to be reformed by 'expert'
service providers), and instead taking a strength-building
or empowerment approach, by working
with parents and their individual circumstances,
tapping into their strengths, and helping them
function in their environments (Puckering et al.,
1994; Mowbray et al., 2000). For example, one
program's philosophy is built on respect for individual
parents and their experiences and knowledge
of their children, and thus advocates mutual
support and partnership between parents and service
providers in addressing parenting difficulties
(Puckering et al., 1994). Thus, instead of
using their expertise solely to guide how parents
should parent, service providers can use their
expertise to help parents develop their strengths,
tap into and maximize benefits from existing
resources, and advocate for themselves in their
communities.


Although current efforts to address parenting
and mental health issues are promising, much
remains to be developed in this area. Most
importantly, many existing programs focus on
addressing difficulties once they have arisen,
but neglect to build resiliency in parents
and families to help them prevent future problems.
Existing parenting programs typically take a
reactive <i>intervention</i> approach, which targets
parents who already show mental health or
parenting difficulties and intervenes with these
problems, rather than a <i>prevention</i> approach,
with the aim of preventing problems by promoting
mental health and adaptive parenting for all
parents. Even among parents who show difficulty,
early intervention approaches can be
implemented before maladaptive parenting
processes become set and difficult to change
(Lyons-Ruth et al., 2000).

[p. <i>290</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00308&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus far, we have discussed individual, group,
and community levels of intervention. However,
perhaps the best venue for taking a prevention
approach to parenting and mental health is
through changes to social policy, or the goals and
guidelines for how a society operates in a given
area. In the case of parenting, social policy governs
how parents are expected to parent children,
how and when society should intervene, what
programs are available for such intervention, and
who has access to those programs. Social policy
also extends beyond policy-making into programming
and funding. Employing social policy
initiatives as a means of addressing parenting
difficulties has the potential for substantial benefits.
Social policy efforts may enable prevention
and intervention programs to reach larger populations,
thereby not only benefiting those at risk
but also improving parenting for those not currently
experiencing difficulties.


Social policy also may be used to make programs
more accessible to parents. As discussed
earlier, many parents with mental health difficulties
face special challenges. For instance, parents
who struggle with mental illness are more likely
to have stressful life circumstances, financial difficulties,
or inadequate social support (Mowbray
et al., 2000). Social policy initiatives can help
parents to overcome these obstacles by encouraging
funding, transportation, and childcare for
participation in parenting programs or by offering
home visit/outreach programs for engaging
isolated or incapacitated parents (Lyons-Ruth
et al, 2000).


Parents with mental health difficulties also
may find themselves facing lengthy or repeated
separations from their families resulting from
crisis admissions to the hospital or criminal
incarceration. Under those circumstances where
separation is unavoidable, policy changes may
help to maintain parent-child relationships by
providing contact opportunities and within-institution
services for parents and their children.
Similarly, because abusive, neglectful, or
severely mentally ill parents risk temporarily or
permanently losing custody rights, they may
avoid seeking help for fear of losing their children
or facing legal incrimination. Social policy
may address such barriers to service by providing
child visit programs for parents in these situations,
or by offering incentives to parents who
independently seek help with their children.


Social policy also can be directed toward
reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness
and parenting difficulties by promoting parenting
programs and increasing social awareness of
mental health issues and the implications for parenting,
thus making parents more likely to seek
available services. Furthermore, instead of
targeting programs for 'incompetent' parents or
those having difficulties, social policy-makers
can bring parenting services and interventions to
a community-based level, directed toward <i>all</i>
parents, thus alleviating the stigma associated
with seeking help. For example, parenting or
family living classes that provide preventive education
as well as intervention services may be
provided to the community as part of an accepted
routine of childcare (as in birthing classes, maternity
wards, well-baby clinics, pediatrician offices).
As such, these programs not only can help
parents with current difficulties, but also can
build resiliency in parents who may otherwise
show difficulties later on.


Finally, addressing parenting at the level of
social policy has several advantages for increasing
our understanding of parental mental health
and parenting. To develop and provide effective
prevention and intervention services for parents,
it is crucial that program developers possess adequate
information about the factors that result in
parenting deficits, as well as those factors that
promote adaptive parenting. Such information
can only be obtained through high-quality
research on parenting processes and intervention
efficacy. Social policy-makers can develop policies
and programs that encourage research on the
determinants of adaptive and maladaptive parenting,
which in turn can inform more effective
programming and policies.


<b>CONCLUSION</b>


Research on parenting and mental health has
demonstrated that certain characteristics of parents
and their contexts can present a challenge to
adaptive parenting. Viewing this research in light
of transactional, ecologically based, and multidimensional
models of parenting illuminates new
perspectives on the potential pathways linking
parent psychological characteristics, psychological
distress and mental illness, and parenting
contexts with the process of parenting.


Figure 17.1 illustrates two key elements of
these pathways, as highlighted in this chapter.
First, bi-directional relations exist among the
many determinants of parenting. For example,
maladaptive social-cognitive processes may contribute
to parental mental illness, which in turn
may affect parents' emotionality. Further, stressful
contexts may exacerbate mental illness, which in
turn creates more stress. Second, Figure 17.1
shows how parent psychological characteristics
and contexts can influence parenting both

[p. <i>291</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00309&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although this complex web of linkages at first
may seem to complicate attempts at prevention
and intervention, it actually may help to uncover
pathways to adaptive parenting. By recognizing
the varied influences on parenting and mental
health, parenting programs can intervene not
only at the level of parenting processes or mental
health difficulties, but also at the level of
antecedent variables. For example, therapeutic
approaches may address early childhood experiences
or life stresses that contribute to mental illness;
family or group interventions may build
social support and reduce family stress, which in
turn may alleviate psychological distress and
thus improve parenting; and cognitively based
treatments may modify maladaptive social-cognitive
mechanisms, so as to intercept the damaging
attributions or efficacy beliefs that mediate
the effect of parental mental illness on parenting.
Based on this increasing awareness of the complicated
interplay among various parenting processes
and contexts, families, service-providers, and policy-makers
can look forward to effective collaboration
to promote positive mental health as well as
adaptive parent-child relationships.
