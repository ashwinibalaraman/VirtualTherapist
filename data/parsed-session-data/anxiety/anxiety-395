Do all abused children need therapy? What type of therapy
works best for maltreated children? How long should it
last? Who should provide it? To answer these questions,
this chapter provides a general discussion of why maltreated
children may need mental health services, how professionals can
decide which children need services and which do not, and how
different treatment approaches can be matched to the specific
presenting symptoms of each child.


? <i>Do All Maltreated Children Have
Mental Health Problems or Need Therapy?</i>


Sometimes, children are sent to therapy simply because they have
been abused. It is not correct to assume, however, that abused
children always need therapy any more than it would be to
assume that all children who have suffered automobile accidents
need stitches. In both cases, some will need the particular treatment
and some will not. Abuse or neglect are not mental health

[p. <i>410</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00430&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Abuse or neglect significantly increases the risk for mental
health symptoms.


• Although risk is increased, not all abused or neglected
children necessarily have symptoms related to their maltreatment.
One third or more of children have minor
symptoms or none at all. There is no evidence that
children without symptoms need extensive treatment.


• The types of symptoms that maltreatment can cause vary
with the types of maltreatment, and they vary widely from
one individual child to another. Although maltreated
children may share some common characteristics, ultimately
each child may be affected in unique ways.


• Maltreated children often have other mental health symptoms
that are unrelated to their maltreatment or that may
predate their maltreatment. For example, an abused child
may have attention deficit or hyperactivity that was not
caused by the abuse but may still need treatment.


? <i>What Should Be Done to Determine
If Mental Health Services Are Needed?</i>


The process of determining what symptoms are present and what
treatment is needed is called <i>assessment</i>. Although some maltreated
children may not need therapy, it is advisable that all
maltreated children be assessed by a qualified mental health
professional to determine their need for services and which
services are appropriate. Assessment is the critical first step and

[p. <i>411</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00431&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The assessment will usually involve an interview with the child
and the child's parents or guardians and conversations with the
child's social worker, schoolteacher, and others. It also may
involve psychological testing, although testing is not necessary in
most cases. A psychologist may conduct testing to help answer
specific questions that remain unanswered after an interview.
Testing is not a "crystal ball," however, and it is not necessary to
process every child through a battery of tests on a routine basis.
Because abuse often occurs in the context of family or social
problems, the assessment should examine these areas, if possible.
When referrals are made for assessment, it is important for
workers to be very clear and very specific about what they want
to know from the assessment. Ask direct questions such as the
following: (a) Does this child have a significant need for mental
health services? (b) If so, what specific types of services are most
indicated? (c) How long would treatment be expected to last?
and (d) Who, in addition to the child, should be involved?
Workers should expect to receive specific and practical answers
to their questions.


? <i>If Treatment Is Needed, What
Type Is Most Appropriate?</i>


Assuming there is a need for mental health treatment, what type
of treatment is best? Should it be group or individual therapy?
Should it be long term or short term? Should it include parents?
What approach should be used? Currently, it is not possible to
clearly answer these questions because research on this topic has
only recently begun. Also, the child's individual assessment will

[p. <i>412</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00432&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many of the treatment approaches described in Table 85.1 are
short term (i.e., approximately 12 sessions) and have been shown
to be associated with significant improvements in major symptom
areas. Most professionals agree that, if needed, treatment should
be initiated as soon as possible, including during the crisis period
often precipitated by disclosure and investigation. Parental involvement
in treatment is generally desirable, and for some types
of treatment (e.g., behavioral parenting programs for acting-out
behaviors) it is absolutely required. Even when children are in
therapy for depression or anxiety, parent involvement has been
found to be helpful. Workers should be cautious of therapists who
routinely refuse to meet with parents or routinely refuse to discuss
the child's therapy with parents or workers.


Studies show that, on average, most abused children are seen
for approximately 12 sessions. It is less clear whether longer term
treatments are necessarily associated with more improvement,
although they may be required for more severe cases. Also, a
general guideline is that one type of therapy focused on the child's
main problem is often as good as or better than multiple therapies.
"Polytherapy," or shotgun approaches, should be avoided. Support
groups or brief educative programs may be appropriate and
may have some preventive benefit, even for asymptomatic children.
Also, note that sometimes no therapy or periodic monitoring
alone is appropriate. Periodic monitoring might be conducted
by a qualified mental health professional. Monitoring might also
be conducted by workers or informed and supportive caregivers.
If workers or parents have questions about monitoring, the
professional who assessed or treated the child can generally
provide individualized specific advice.


If treatment is needed, children should get it. Although this
sounds simple, many workers know it is not. Simply making a
referral for service does not ensure that the service is actually
received. Assistance may be needed in scheduling appointments,
transportation, arranging child care, or securing payment. Assistance
may be needed to maintain motivation. Also, workers need
to closely monitor clients' attendance, progress, and satisfaction
with services.

This chapter reviews typical behavioral and affective problems
seen in abused and neglected children. Effective
strategies to suggest to parents and foster parents are
described, and recommendations regarding when to refer children
for mental health intervention are presented.


? <i>What Are Typical Problems and
Effective Strategies to Help Abused
and Neglected Children?</i>


1. Typical internalizing problems are anxiety, fearfulness, depression,
and low self-esteem. These children may appear sad, withdrawn,
frightened, or lonely. They may have problems sleeping
and eating.

• Praise the child for being "brave," being a "big boy" or
"big girl," and trying new activities.


• Reassure the child that he or she is safe.


2. Typical externalizing problems are aggressive behavior and
oppositional or defiant behavior. These children can be aggressive
with other children, adults, animals, or property. They may be
uncooperative, defiant, and take a negative stance repeatedly.
They will test your patience and can be difficult to manage.

3. The following are other childhood problems that may be
present in maltreated children:


<i>Enuresis:</i> This is wetting in the daytime or persistent nighttime
wetting after age 5. Children may regress to earlier childhood
behaviors, such as wetting the bed, when abuse occurs or when
they are removed from their home. This is not unusual because
it may occur with nonabused children in a new setting.

<i>Encopresis:</i> This is soiling in children older than age 4. Children
may become constipated due to changes in their diet or surroundings,
or children may be hesitant to use the toilet in a new setting,
resulting in soiling. In some cases, children may have difficulty
controlling their bowel movements as a result of sexual abuse.

<i>Attachment disorders:</i> Children may not have a positive attachment
or closeness to their primary caregivers. They may be
withdrawn or "detached" from new caregivers, or they may
quickly form an inappropriately close attachment to new adults;
both of these attachment forms can be problematic.

<i>Academic problems:</i> Children may have difficulty adjusting to a
new classroom and teacher. Their performance at school can be
affected by other problems discussed in this chapter. Because
children attend school for several hours each day, a satisfactory
adjustment in this setting is very important.

<i>Attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit with hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD):</i> Children who have persistent inattentiveness,
an inability to concentrate, and high levels of physical
activity may have ADD or ADHD. Abused children with high
levels of anxiety or posttraumatic stress disorder, however, may
appear to have ADHD due to their agitated or disorganized
behavior. This differentiation should be made by a mental health
professional or physician with training and experience in this
area.

him or her to "slow down" that the child does not view

<i>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD):</i> Some children have symptoms
of PTSD, such as recurrent, unwanted memories or dreams
of the abuse; persistent avoidance of thoughts or feelings about
the abuse; or persistent symptoms of increased arousal, such as
irritability, sleeping problems, and difficulty concentrating.

Facilitating children's adjustment to out-of-home placement
is in many ways a precarious venture. Children are biologically
equipped to develop intimate relationships with their
first parents, particularly their biological parents. When they are
moved to another family, their attachment systems are challenged
in a way that may affect their relationships throughout the life
span. Thus, this chapter accepts the premise that it is inherently
stressful for any child older than 6 months of age to adjust to a
new home environment.


Therefore, the goal of the child welfare practitioner is to
support the child to develop the best relationship possible with
the out-of-home care provider. This is important whether the
permanency goal is a return home or adoptive placement. A
child's potential move to another family should not be used as a
reason to inhibit the child's attachment to the current caregivers.
Because a child's placement is contingent on many factors, it is
difficult to predict the timing and circumstances of a move. More
important, if a child has felt the comfort and support of one
attachment relationship, he or she is much more able to be open
to another.


In keeping with this goal, practitioner strategies to facilitate
children's adjustment to out-of-home care should most often

• Immediately placing pictures and belongings of the child
throughout the house, taking a family picture with the
child in it, and involving the child in family rituals and
activities


• Allowing the child to grieve the loss of the former parents
by giving him or her space and support to feel sad and
angry


• Identifying a "transitional object" for the child (i.e., a
concrete, psychologically meaningful object to remind
the child of the positive aspects of a former familial
relationship)


• Frequent visits for the child with the new family, with
duration of the visitation period contingent on the child's
developmental period (shorter for young children and
longer for adolescents); if possible, first visit should occur
in the child's current home


• If possible, meeting between current and former caregivers
to discuss the child's preferences and dislikes,
caregiving routines the child experienced, disciplinary
strategies that worked, and any major events for the child


• Ideal transition entails the former parent psychologically
"handing over" the child to the new parent via an appropriate
good-bye and well-wishing


As child welfare practitioners seek to support children
through various placements, it is important that they consider the
following issues: (a) Any move is traumatic for children, particularly
during specific developmental periods (e.g., 6-36 months)
and in specific circumstances (e.g., if the child is very attached to
the biological parent); (b) the strategies used to facilitate adjustment
should be determined by the needs of the individual child
and consistent with the developmental period of the child (e.g.,
a transitional object for a young child may be a stuffed animal,
whereas for an adolescent it may be an old pair of sneakers);
(c) the memory of former parents should be supported for children
in ways they can tolerate; (d) the child needs many outlets
for expressing negative and positive feelings about each parent;
and (e) the trauma that accompanies moves can be diminished by

Whenever a child protective services worker or a law
enforcement official deems that a child is not safe in
his or her immediate family environment or is in
imminent danger of abuse or neglect, emergency child removal
and placement is considered. Generally, if resources cannot be
found to quickly alter the situation, and reduce the risk, the child
is separated from the parent(s) and placed with relatives or in the
foster care system. Such separation is always costly in terms of
child development and family functioning, and it should occur
only when the child's prominent need for safety is jeopardized.
Separation reinforces a child's sense of impermanence and diffuses
identity, potentially contributing to (a) a lack of attachment
to the adult caregiver(s), (b) a decreased sense of self-worth,
(c) inability to trust others, (d) emotional and intellectual delays,
(e) diminished ability to cope with normal developmental
stresses, and (f) hopelessness. Culture represents the lens through
which we all understand what is unacceptable child rearing and
what is child protection. Certainly, culture plays a role in ameliorating
the potentially negative impact of out-of-home placements

[p. <i>426</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00446&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Culturally Competent Programs and Practices</i>


Culturally competent organizations are most effective in supporting
out-of-home placements due to their recognition of the need
to recognize the cultural and ethnic diversity of the client population
that the agency serves. Indeed, the organization's policymakers
or governing boards ensure a process for developing and
updating a mission that reflects a commitment to the population
served, recruiting diverse staff, and evaluating policy and program
directions with input from individual representatives of the
different cultures or ethnic groups. The importance of cultural
identity for all clients is valued.


Children who are placed in out-of-home care require a program
that engages its staff and nonrelative caregivers in training
regarding cross-cultural communication, culturally diverse family
customs, and conflict resolution. Program outcomes should be
evaluated to determine whether there are differential results for
different cultural or ethnic groups. Case plans should consider
the availability of community resources and should be formulated
in settings that are most comfortable to the family (i.e., home,
neighborhood facility, or church).


? <i>Practice Issues</i>


Ultimately, direct service staff should recognize opportunities for
accommodating the cultural dimension in all aspects of out-of-home
placements. The following sections present typical areas
warranting close examination by the worker. These areas represent
opportunities for celebrating differences and cultural identity,
as a resource for enhancing the benefits of the placement,
while reducing secondary risk factors due to separation. The
worker should include these in his or her assessment of the
biological family, and assume the responsibility for ensuring that
the relative or foster placement accommodates the child's culturally
specific values and experiences to the extent possible.

[p. <i>427</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00447&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Matching</i>
</b>


Unfortunately, often children are placed in emergency situations,
and little time is available for matching them with the
initial placements. It is important to recognize that children
placed in new settings must adapt rapidly to new ways of "how
we are <i>here</i>." Ultimately, when a child is placed in out-of-home
care, he or she needs a great amount of love, forgiveness, reasonable
structure, support, and stimulation. Matching is also critical,
however, because diverse cultural groups (i.e., families, institutions,
or communities) have different values and rhythms. It is
important to consider cultural ramifications in the match because
of the vast differences in lifestyles; recreational and leisure activities;
religious orientation, practices, and spiritual needs; and
general interests. Relative and nonrelative caregivers should be
screened for their recognition of the differing values that might
be relevant to the child and his or her biological parents.


Caregivers who are intolerant or judgmental serve only to
create divided loyalties for the child and to undermine possible
reunification. Adoptive parents who are culturally insensitive are
at risk for disrupting placement at the onset of adolescence, when
the child's autonomy allows the cultural difference to become
apparent or realized. Unfortunately, culturally incompetent caregivers
may alienate a child from his or her own racial or ethnic
identity, thus creating new challenges in the adult years. Good
matching is good practice and produces stable placements, which
can survive crises and promote continuity of care for highly
vulnerable children.


<b>
<i>Grooming</i>
</b>


This aspect is often minimized, but it is an important consideration.
Hair texture and style, clothes, colors and trends, nail
care and jewelry, and actual skin care all reflect racial and ethnic
considerations. A common complaint of African American professionals
is the number of children in cross-cultural placements
whose skin is not oiled or whose hair is washed too frequently or
left unbraided. Some cultural groups, however, value bright
colors and place great emphasis on vibrant and distinctive clothing,
even for males.

[p. <i>428</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00448&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Food</i>
</b>


Food has symbolic and nutritional benefits. Children in out-of-home
placement are nurtured emotionally and sustained by
food that is familiar to them and reflects their cultural heritage.


<b>
<i>Celebration and Mourning</i>
</b>


Various cultural groups express joy and grief in different ways.
For some families, the death of an elder becomes an opportunity
to celebrate and "party." For others, death is received briefly and
very solemnly: The dead are buried the day after death. For even
others, death is viewed as something to be respected and is a
natural conclusion of life. The family must come from afar and
gather to reaffirm its ties and anticipate the next loss. For some,
weddings and graduations may result in family members traveling
afar in some groups and celebrations lasting for several days.
Children in out-of-home placement should be supported in maintaining
their family and cultural ties, especially with regard to
reunions of any type. Minimally, these children should be allowed
a preference.


<b>
<i>Health Care</i>
</b>


Different cultural groups have had different experiences with
the health care system. Linguistically isolated populations, for
example, have limited access in English-speaking systems and
often feel disempowered. Other groups are distrusting of a health
care system that may be perceived as "experimenting" with poor
people, providing inferior services, or withholding care. Children
in out-of-home placement may be vulnerable to a history of
minimal contact with medical professionals for the previously
discussed reasons. Parents and caregivers may be suspicious of
medications (e.g., psychotropic). When there is an emphasis on
prevention or behavior management, children may be perceived
as "bad" and not needing medication; medication may be viewed
as dependency forming or harmful. Efforts should be made to
negotiate these issues and should include a high degree of attention
to health education.

[p. <i>429</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00449&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Discipline and Advocacy</i>
</b>


Discipline is a controversial issue in low-income ethnic minority
communities because parents may be more inclined to
employ corporal discipline when rearing children. Children in
out-of-home placement may be more accustomed to physical
controls being imposed on them and may view this type of
discipline as "caring"; caregivers, however, are typically prohibited
from using such discipline. In fact, the child protection
worker may have identified physical discipline as a risk factor that
contributed to the removal of the child under the category of
neglect. Another substantial reason why children of color are
often removed involves inadequate supervision. There are cultural
variations regarding the age and the conditions under which
children are old enough to take care of themselves or supervise
another child. Caregivers need to recognize that the biological
parent who uses corporal discipline is not necessarily abusive or
uncaring. Certainly, this attitude should not be communicated to
the child in care.


<b>
<i>Sexuality</i>
</b>


This is another characteristic that indicates cultural differences
in the socialization of children. Issues include nudity, type
of attire, sexual language, sexual exploration, dating, and peer
sexual contact. For the child in out-of-home placement, there is
a need for the worker to understand the family's handling of these
issues and to support the foster parent in providing transitional
clarity for the child in adjusting to the different "rules" in the new
setting.


<b>
<i>Spirituality</i>
</b>


One of the most prominent community institutions in cultural
minority communities is the church or the mosque. Although
children may not have formal religious training when placed, and
their parents may not be active worshippers, deep-rooted spiritual
beliefs may be an essential aspect of their background.
Supporting the child's spiritual growth and development in

? <i>Summary</i>


In summary, children in out-of-home placements require a total
organizational approach to optimally maintain their cultural
identity. Culturally competent organizations creatively challenge
themselves to address the unique needs of all children while
promoting the children's sense of "peoplehood" and cultural
identity.

<b>S</b>tudies have shown that abused and neglected children often
suffer from a variety of physical, developmental, and emotional
problems that need attention. These problems may
be due to the maltreatment (e.g., seizures from shaken baby
syndrome) or the inadequate care provided by the family (e.g.,
delays in immunizations). An approach to providing care to these
children is to consider the following levels of pediatric care:

Although some children are placed in foster care directly from a
health care facility (e.g., a child who is placed after evaluation
and treatment of a broken femur), many other children enter
foster care without a recent medical examination and should
receive a timely medical exam (within 3-5 days). This exam can
be done by the child's pediatrician, the pediatrician for the foster

• Urgent, serious mental health problems (e.g., suicidal
thoughts) (Ideally, this assessment should be done by a
mental health professional.)


? <i>Comprehensive Health Evaluation</i>


An abused or neglected child (either living at home or placed in
foster care) should have a comprehensive evaluation to develop
a treatment plan that includes the child's health and mental health
needs. If the child is in foster care, the child protective service
(CPS) agency has the responsibility of ensuring an appropriate
evaluation.


The evaluation might be performed in a specialized foster care
clinic in which the child is evaluated by a multidisciplinary team
that might include a pediatrician, a developmental specialist (for
children younger than 5 years of age), a mental health expert, and
an educator. Alternatively, the pediatric exam can be conducted
separately and the child referred to appropriate services in the
community.


The pediatric evaluation focuses on the child's


• Immunization status


• Growth


• Abnormalities on physical exam (e.g., findings of past
sexual abuse)


• Vision and hearing screen


• Developmental abnormalities (e.g., delayed language)


• Behavioral problems (e.g., bed-wetting or soiling)


• Progress in school



[p. <i>433</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00453&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Need for screening tests (e.g., for anemia, lead, or tuberculosis)


When abnormalities are detected, it is important that the child
receive appropriate services (e.g., referral to an ear, nose, and
throat specialist for chronic ear infections and a specialized
preschool program for children with language delay). Often,
recommended services are not obtained; CPS has a valuable role
in ensuring that the child receives necessary care.


? <i>Ongoing Health Supervision</i>


Abused and neglected children, like all children, need ongoing
health care to provide immunizations, periodic physical examinations
and screening, and treatment of chronic health conditions
such as asthma. In addition, maltreated children and their families
need careful monitoring in the following areas:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Growth:</i> Many children, particularly those who have been
neglected or have suffered from nonorganic failure to
thrive, grow well in foster homes. Documenting these
changes in growth can be important when making
decisions regarding whether the child should continue
in placement or be returned to the biological family.
</p>
<p>
<i>Development and behavior:</i> Advances in the child's development
and improvements in the child's behavior
usually indicate a good adjustment in foster care. Persistent
abnormalities may indicate the need for more
intensive services for the child. The new onset of a
behavioral problem or the recurrence of an old problem
may suggest new stresses, such as the beginning of
unsupervised visits with the biological parents. The
pediatrician can help document a child's response to
such visitations and help facilitate counseling if indicated.

can help determine whether foster parents are
providing adequate and appropriate care. If foster
parents are struggling to provide such care, the pediatrician
can provide advice and referrals for counseling,
notify CPS, advise an alternative placement for the
child, or all three.

<i>Signs of maltreatment:</i> Children in foster care often feel
safe to talk about the maltreatment that they have
suffered in their biological homes. The pediatrician can
examine the child related to these disclosures or refer
the child to the appropriate specialist. Children can be
abused, neglected, or sexually abused in foster care or
during visitations with parents. Pediatricians can be
helpful in evaluating new statements by the child, new
symptoms (e.g., vaginal discharge), or new injuries.

Enhancing something assumed to be as <i>basic</i> as the capacity
to parent is fraught with difficulties, from helping parents
to acknowledge the need for help to shifting well-ingrained
patterns of interpersonal responding. This chapter focuses on
both process issues and the active strategies needed to produce
parental change. For the former, we outline professional skills
and special issues when dealing with multistressed parents. For
the latter, we discuss both how to change how parents think about
children's behavior and their development and a set of skill areas
needed to enhance parenting: life skills, cognitive stimulation and
child management, anger and stress management, and basic child
care (e.g., home safety and hygiene).


? <i>Process Issues and Special Problems</i>


There are special problems you will likely encounter in establishing
rapport and working with parents. First, in many cases,
parents are involuntary clients and may resent being told what to
do by an "expert." They may also fear that you will assume a
blaming stance and view them as "bad parents." It is important
to balance your expertise with empowering parents. You need to
create an environment in which parents believe that you and they

[p. <i>438</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00458&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

1. Listen! Listen! Listen some more before you intervene.


2. Do not set yourself up as an expert--stay low-key.


3. Emphasize the positive (build on what parents have done
well).


4. Let parents know that you do not view them as bad (e.g.,
"You really are trying hard to help your son").


5. If you do need to criticize, do it in "normative" terms (e.g.,
"Lots of parents think that works, but ..").


6. Use adult analogies to make your points (e.g., to explain
rewarding children, you could state, "If you worked all day
making a nice dinner for your boyfriend and afterwards he
didn't say anything, would you do it again?")


7. Be concrete in your explanations and have parents explain

8. Use gentle humor to make a point and praise generously.


Parents are often multistressed. Mastering new skills requires
continuity and consistent practice. It is difficult to teach parents
to be consistent with their children when their own lives are not
stable. Relapse is common and maintaining gains requires including
a relapse prevention component (i.e., developing a plan for
how they will get "back on track" if they slip into old patterns).
Because families live from crisis to crisis, it is also difficult for
treatment to remain goal directed. Crises need to be addressed
but should be used to illustrate skills being trained. For example,
if a parent is having trouble with her landlord, communication
and problem-solving skills that are being directed toward working
with her children can be used (e.g., role-playing how to talk

[p. <i>439</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00459&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A final set of concerns involve professional strains (e.g.,
conflicts of values, potential for having unrealistic expectations
of parents and ourselves, and difficulties with holding adequate
as opposed to optimal parenting as a goal). Dealing with violence
also means working in a context of risk (e.g., reporting abuse and
potential for direct and vicarious trauma to professionals). It is
helpful to work in teams to deal with these issues.


? <i>Deciding Whether Parenting
Is What Should Be Targeted</i>


Parents can have multiple problems that interfere with treatment
(e.g., substance abuse and psychiatric diagnoses) that might need
resolution first or to be treated simultaneously with parenting
work. Cognitive limitations also present challenges. Targeting
more basic skills (e.g., math for shopping and increasing literacy
to read medicine labels) and breaking material into very small
steps are helpful.


? <i>Practical Issues</i>


A practical decision is whether to conduct work in the office or
home setting. The office allows freedom from distractions and
may be the only option if the child is in foster care. Problems with
office visits include the requirement that parents have the skills
and resources to negotiate getting to the office and greater
concerns that they are being evaluated when they are in this
setting. Home visits may be preferable. They have the added
benefits of naturally occurring child misbehavior with which to
work and potential for greater generalization of learning because
this is the natural setting of parenting. The disadvantage is the
greater potential for interruptions and chaos that may interrupt
the flow of work. If an office is used, a setting that has a
"home-like" quality will place the parent and child at ease. There
should also be "props" for creating parenting dilemmas (e.g.,
messy play materials) and opportunities (e.g., books). Ideally, the

[p. <i>440</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00460&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another decision is whether to do individual or group work.
The benefits of groups are many (e.g., parents learn by comparison,
it is easier for parents to see a problem when it is another
parent's, parents listen to each other more than they do to
professionals, parents begin to see that some problems are inherent
in stages of development rather than their children being
"bad," and parents feel less alone). Groups may be less useful for
cognitively limited parents. Also, group work needs to be combined
with individual work to refine parents' skills, identify
misapplication of techniques, and monitor child risk. Support
groups are useful for low-risk parents in cases in which stress is
producing the parenting deficits (e.g., Parents Anonymous),
whereas moderate and high-risk parents need skills training and
education groups in addition to support. (For an example of a
parenting group program, see Azar, 1989).


? <i>The Targets of Enhancement</i>


Parenting involves thinking (e.g., problem solving, appropriate
labeling of child behavior, and perspective taking) and doing (e.g.,
appropriate discipline). Both aspects need to be addressed (see
Chapter 65, this volume, for an assessment model). Basic intervention
strategies include <i>didactic instruction, modeling new
responses, role plays, and providing feedback</i>.


Work on understanding and interpreting child behavior includes
the following:


1. <i>Increasing knowledge regarding developmental norms and
basic care</i> (e.g., identifying when a rash is in need of a
physician's care): This is best done through demonstrations
and concrete examples (e.g., an exercise in which parents
are asked to perform a task they cannot do, such as fix a
carburetor, to help them understand what its like for children;
role-playing emergencies).


2. <i>Challenging unrealistic expectations regarding children and
misattributions</i> (Appendix 7, Table A7.3) using cognitive
restructuring, which includes teaching parents to do the
following:

[p. <i>441</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00461&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Recognize that their thoughts about situations and others
affect their mood and behavior (e.g., believing their child
is "out to get them" makes it harder to stay calm and teach
their child).


• Generate their own "personalized" cognitions in problem
situations using role plays and questioning (e.g., "All
moms find tantrums hard, but what about them is the
most upsetting <i>for you</i>? What goes through your head?").


• Challenge dysfunctional or self-defeating cognitions (e.g.,
"Is he really doing this on purpose?" and "Do you really
think other mothers can do this?"). Demonstrating children's
lower capacities can also be useful.


• Replace them with more appropriate "self-talk," such as
"He's only 2. He doesn't know any better" or "I am doing
the best I can."


3. <i>Helping parents to see their role in children's learning</i>. This
involves explaining the impact of modeling, reinforcement,
and punishment on their children's behavior. It is important,
for example, to teach the parents that parental attention can
actually increase negative behaviors (e.g., giving in to tantrums
in the grocery store) and increase appropriate behaviors
(e.g., "Why did he learn to be toilet trained? Because
you gave him attention when he tried. Your attention is his
‘paycheck’!").


4. <i>Training parents in the steps of problem solving</i>, including
problem identification, alternative solution generation, and
evaluating outcomes


In addition to changing thinking, parents need behavioral
skills. These vary with development--from skills as basic as how
to feed and diaper infants to more complex skills such as negotiating
curfews with teens. A component analysis of the steps of
the skill needs to be done and factors that interfere with use
identified. The following are examples:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. <i>Child management skills training</i> is useful to widen parents'
repertoire beyond negative ones (e.g., yelling and physical
punishment) (see Appendix 7, Table A7.4). Parents should
be trained in the use of positive techniques (use of rewards
to increase appropriate behavior; distraction). (For more

information regarding child management skills training, see
Becker, 1971; Appendix 7). Parents also need discrimination
training (e.g., matching the type and level of response
to the nature of the misbehavior and how this changes with
children's development).

2. <i>Anger and stress management</i> often need to be learned before
other parenting strategies can be carried out well. Although
direct assistance can address contextual stresses (e.g., financial
help and marital work), training in managing stress and
anger is also essential. This involves three steps. First, parents
need to identify triggers for anger and stress. Through
questioning their examples of stressful times (e.g., "What
caused the stress or anger?" "How did you feel?" "What
were you thinking?" "What did you do?" and "How did
your child or others react?"), a pattern of "hot" issues or
events that set off a parent and his or her unique set of
"warning" signs can be identified. The latter can include
physical responses ("I feel a tightening in my stomach") and
cognitive responses ("I say to myself, 'Why me? It's not
fair!' " or "He's doing this on purpose! He wants me to look
bad.") Relaxation skills (e.g., deep muscle relaxation) or
"better" self-talk (e.g., "It feels like he's trying to get to me,
but he's just tired.") can then be taught.


3. <i>Neglect issues</i> are among the most difficult to address. Skill
areas include home safety, hygiene, emergency skills, budgeting
and nutrition, medical care skills, and supervision
skills. As noted previously, breaking skills down into small
steps and working on each is essential. For example, programs
exist in which parents are trained to scan their home
and identify and rectify safety risks (e.g., uncovered outlets).
First, someone models this task, and then the parents attempt
to do so. Spot checks are then made to help them
maintain safety. Emergencies can be staged and the problem
solving and behavioral responses modeled for them. (See
Appendix 7 for references to the work of Tymchuk and
Lutzker and colleagues.)


4. <i>Work on increasing social support</i> is also important to help
reduce stress through the provision of information, concrete
help, and feedback. Social skills training may also be useful
(e.g., role plays of asking another parent for coffee), as can
support groups (see Chapter 92, this volume).

Although the service needs of abused children and abusers
are generally acknowledged, the service needs of nonabusive
parents may be easy to overlook. In fact, nonabusive
parents have sometimes been blamed rather than helped.
Nonabusive partners may be either men or women, although
most research and discussion have focused on nonabusive mothers,
particularly in sexual abuse cases in which they are sometimes
labeled as "unprotective," "unsupportive," or "in collusion with
the abusive parent." For example, it has been suggested that some
women may actually seek out and marry child molesters based
on some presumed (and unproven) unconscious psychopathology,
possibly related to their own abuse history. In particular,
mothers in incest abuse cases have been viewed with suspicion at
best or contempt at worst. It is often assumed that they secretly
knew about their child's abuse and condoned it. The available
research suggests that few of these stereotypes are true for the
majority of nonabusive parents. Most tend to believe and support
their children. Few are aware of, let alone condone, sexual abuse.
There are only slightly higher rates of childhood sexual abuse for
mothers in incest families than other women. Also, nonabusive
partners as a group have no typical personality profile or demonstrable
psychopathology.

[p. <i>445</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00465&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is clear, however, that nonabusive partners are commonly
and understandably upset or even in crisis after abuse has been
reported in their family. In sexual abuse cases, abuse is often
hidden and secretive. Disclosure can be an acute emotional shock
for the nonabusive parent, who may react with disbelief, guilt,
fear, panic, anger, confusion, emotional numbness, or a mixture
of all these emotions. In some cases, the nonabusive partner may
be the victim of domestic violence from the abuser and may feel
paralyzed to act or may fear for her own welfare and that of her
entire family. Occasionally, women who have been repeatedly
victimized and dominated may seem helpless to act at all. In most
of these circumstances, the correct types of services can help.


Two types of services are important: services designed to
benefit the nonabusive parent directly and services for the children
and family that include the nonabusive parent as a participant.
Services designed to benefit nonabusive parents directly
might include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Protective services, such as protection from partner violence,
shelter services, or other services designed to ensure
physical safety: This is a critical first step in any work with
nonabusive parents.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Concrete supports, such as child care, employment, temporary
assistance to needy families, housing, and transportation
services: These might be needed in cases in
which the abusive parent is the primary breadwinner for
the family and has left the home or should leave the home.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Social supports, such as parent support groups, supportive
therapy, home visitation, or other interventions designed
to create supportive social networks: Parents may
also be encouraged to use whatever natural support systems
might be available and helpful, such as friendship
networks, church or clergy, and family.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Mental health services, such as therapy groups or individual
therapy: These services manage problems related to
the emotional upset or turmoil often associated with
disclosure.

It is critical to recognize that nonabusive parents may need
the previously discussed types of help for their own sake. Also,
the interests of the abused child and the other children in the

[p. <i>446</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00466&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally, it is important to remember that nonabusive parents
not only are acutely upset but also are caught between many
conflicting demands. They may feel responsible for the welfare
of both the abused child and other children in the family or for
the welfare of their abusive spouse with whom there may be a
strong or ambivalent attachment. Nonabusive parents commonly
receive unsolicited and conflicting advice or demands from
friends, family, spouse, child protective services, therapists, ministers,
and professionals. It is important that workers avoid
arguing, lecturing, or pressuring nonabusive parents at this point.
Advising should be kept to a minimum. Workers should avoid
blaming or labeling the parent as "unprotective" or "unsupportive."
This can have the unintended effect of creating an adversarial
relationship between the parent and the agency that may
become permanent. Better results can be obtained by first establishing
a nonjudgmental and supportive relationship, listening
carefully and empathetically, and attempting to help the non-abusive
parent make a healthy and empowered decision about the
parent's children and family on his or her own. Although this
cannot be accomplished in all cases, a patient and supportive
approach often yields the best outcomes.

[p. <i>447</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00467&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Families at risk for child maltreatment are often multi-problem
families. The association between child maltreatment
and socioeconomic distress (including unemployment,
poor housing, and welfare reliance) means that high-risk
families are frequently stressed by their living conditions. Child
maltreatment is also associated with domestic violence, substance
abuse, residential mobility, neighborhood dysfunction, parental
emotional problems, and other difficulties. In addition to these
life stresses, high-risk families are often socially isolated within
their communities, lacking strong relational ties to neighbors,
family, friends, coworkers, or others who could provide assistance.


Because of these characteristics, assistance to high-risk families
often includes efforts to better integrate family members into
supportive social networks. Strengthening social support is believed
to have many advantages for the treatment and prevention
of child maltreatment. Social support offers emotional sustenance
to parents that can assist in their coping with the frustration,

[p. <i>448</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00468&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>What Is Social Isolation?</i>


How is social support accomplished? One must first have an
understanding of what is meant by the "social isolation" of
high-risk families. When families are described as socially isolated,
this typically means that they have infrequent contact with
extended family, neighbors, friends, and others in the community.
Their social networks are thus small and limited. It is not always
true, however, that family members feel lonely or isolated or
perceive that friends or kin are unsupportive or unhelpful. Sometimes
they do. In other cases, however, parents feel considerable
emotional support from the limited number of people with whom
they associate, even though these relationships are ineffective in
reducing their abusive behavior (this sometimes occurs when
family or friends are hesitant to challenge a parent's treatment of
offspring and instead act reassuringly or minimize the seriousness
of harm in an effort to act supportively). Sometimes, parents
deliberately limit the size of their social networks to people who
share their values and orientation to child rearing. Therefore,
strengthening positive community ties for treating or preventing
child maltreatment requires more than merely increasing the size
of the family's social network. It also requires strengthening
relationships that family members perceive as emotionally supportive
and that contribute to changing harmful parental practices.

? <i>Reasons for Social Isolation</i>


It is important to understand why troubled families become
socially isolated. Several reasons have been identified in studies
of high-risk families:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Parents may isolate themselves from neighborhood and
kin contacts because they recognize that their behavior is
inappropriate, and they seek to escape detection.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Family members may be stigmatized and ostracized within
their neighborhoods and extended family because of their
atypical behavior. Families may be stigmatized because of
how children are treated but also for other reasons,
including domestic violence, poverty, substance abuse,
mental illness, social incompetence, and delinquency.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Family members may fail to create or maintain social
connections because they are too exhausted by stressful
life circumstances to expend energy on sociability or
because asking for assistance may be experienced as humiliating
or demeaning.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Family members may become socially isolated because of
limited social competence: They lack the skills for initiating
new relationships with others and maintaining these
connections through positive reciprocity, warm sociability,
and mutual assistance.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Families may live in communities that are dangerous,
depleted, or dysfunctional in the "human capital" they
have to offer in activities, resources, or relationships.
Social isolation thus reflects a response to difficult neighborhood
conditions.

and it is necessary to understand these before developing strategies
for strengthening social support.

? <i>Strengthening Positive Community Connections</i>


The following are some approaches to consider:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>Normalize the need for social support:</i> Sometimes support
is neither sought nor maintained because the need for it
is unrecognized. Assistance in recognizing the potential
benefits of social support, which everyone needs, can be

<p>
• <i>Assess community resources for social support:</i> Within the
social networks of family members, where are potential
sources of support and community integration? Do extended
family members live nearby? Are workplace associates
possible candidates for assistance? For children, do
teachers, counselors, and peers at school offer opportunities
for social integration? Are neighbors available, constructively
interested, and capable? Do family members
have interests or skills that offer opportunities for new,
positive relationships with others who share their interests?
An assessment of the family's needs and personal
resources, as well as those of the community, is essential.

• <i>Coordinate formal and informal assistance:</i> Formal
sources of support are professionals such as social workers,
counselors, physicians, school personnel, clergy, and
others who have been trained to provide assistance to
troubled family members. Informal sources of support
include neighbors, extended family members, coworkers,
classmates, and friends who lack professional training but
are often the first to whom family members turn for
assistance. It is important not only to identify potential
sources of support but also to coordinate these sources
for the family, such as asking clergy to enlist assistance
from the religious community, asking a school counselor
to talk to teachers about a child's needs, or asking a
physician to make referrals to needed social services for
the family. In doing so, the specialized roles assumed by

• <i>Bridge access to community connections:</i> It is sometimes
true that socially isolated family members have little
knowledge of community resources and few means of
accessing those resources. It may be necessary, therefore,
not only to inform parents about agencies, community
groups, and programs that would benefit them but also
to provide transportation, assist in making and keeping
appointments, and bridging access in other practical
ways.


• <i>Improving recipient reactions to assistance:</i> Sometimes,
receiving help can be experienced as humiliating or denigrating,
and aid might be rejected because of feelings of
indebtedness or failure. Positive community connections
are instilled when assistance can be accepted constructively,
and this often occurs when assistance is reciprocated
(e.g., the recipient is enlisted to help needy others),
occurs in contexts that reduce stigma, and is accompanied
by efforts to reduce dependency and strengthen self-reliance.


• <i>Strengthening social skills:</i> Strengthening social skills in
troubled family members is not easy, especially because
social skills deficits are often tied to broader family
problems (e.g., substance abuse and emotional problems).
Nevertheless, the motivation to establish meaningful relationships
with others, improve communication skills,
learn to reciprocate assistance offered by others, reduce
defensiveness, and strengthen conflict-resolution capabilities
should be goals of efforts to improve positive
community connections through strengthened social
skills.


• <i>Assisting sources of social support:</i> Helping needy families
can be exhausting, especially for informal helpers with no
professional training. Thus, efforts to assist those who can
support family members, such as through informal counseling
of extended family members or neighborhood
networking, can strengthen their contribution to improved
family functioning.

Sexual perpetrator treatment is not a "cure"; the goal of
treatment is to teach a perpetrator how to identify, intervene,
and control his or her sexually abusive behaviors and
strategies used to entrap the victim(s). The true clients in perpetrator
treatment are past and potential victims of the identified
perpetrator; community safety is of the utmost importance.


? <i>General</i>


A sexual perpetrator will not change his or her behavior (self-correct)
without external intervention, which includes treatment
and pressure from the judicial system. The perpetrator's internal
motivation greatly enhances the prognosis but is typically not
present at the onset of treatment. Perpetrators should be mandated
by criminal or juvenile court to participate in, not just
attend, treatment. Also, a period of incarceration can further
motivate a perpetrator. The sanction of consequences besides
therapy can help motivate a perpetrator. Treatment should be a
collaborative effort. Through an interdisciplinary approach involving
child welfare, probation, treatment, and polygraph, a

[p. <i>454</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00474&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perpetrator treatment is of a long duration. Typically, the
perpetrator should have, at a minimum, 1½ to 2 years of intervention.
The perpetrator can learn his or her pattern of offending
and strategies by which to control such behaviors and at the same
time be managed by a system that is concerned about public safety
and victim protection.


? <i>Treatment Provider Qualifications</i>


The treatment provider should have an advanced degree in a
human services field from a fully accredited institution. Furthermore,
he or she should receive continuing education in sexual
perpetrator-specific interventions through attendance at regional
and national conferences and a thorough review of the current
research. Preferably, the professional should have a minimum of
2,000 hours of direct experience with sexual perpetrators. The
professional should provide sexual perpetrator-specific treatment
and not general counseling.


? <i>Psychosexual Evaluation</i>


A perpetrator should receive a psychosexual evaluation prior to
entering treatment. This evaluation, which includes a detailed
social and sexual history, provides treatment recommendations
and determines the best means of intervention for the individual.
It can identify the individual perpetrator's level of risk and can
be used as part of a presentence investigation.


? <i>Treatment</i>


A sexual perpetrator's behavior is the product of decisions that
he or she has made. It is not a spontaneous action; thus, the
intervention must be a cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention
program. Cognitions are thought processes that are part of all
intentional behaviors. Relapse prevention is a self-control program
that was originally developed in the addictions field and
modified for sexual abuse perpetrators. It assists perpetrators in
identifying and coping with behaviors that could lead to relapse

[p. <i>455</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00475&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Treatment Modalities</i>


Treatment should involve individual and group therapy and, in
some cases, marital and family sessions. Group therapy has
become a preferred modality of intervention because it provides
an atmosphere of affirmation, confrontation, and socialization
from both therapists and other perpetrators. Furthermore, group
therapy interrupts two of the elements needed to maintain sexual
abuse--isolation and secrecy. Individual therapy is beneficial in
the beginning of treatment and as a supplement to group sessions.
In cases of incest, marital and family sessions should occur when
reunification is probable. Family sessions should not be provided,
however, until all members of the family are entrenched in their
individual treatment and the professionals believe the sessions
will be of benefit rather than possibly harming any of the family
members.


? <i>Treatment Goals</i>


The focus of treatment is to assist perpetrators in asserting control
over their sexually abusive behaviors. This management will need
to continue throughout their life. The perpetrator must acquire
motivation not to reoffend. This is assessed through his or her
investment and participation in treatment and willingness to
attempt new life patterns.


Taking responsibility for one's behavior is pivotal to relapse
prevention. Perpetrators need to hold themselves responsible for
the sexual perpetrations and thinking errors, divulge the grooming
behaviors and actions of all sexual perpetrations (initial
referral and others), identify their own triggers and warning signs,
combat denial in its numerous forms, and demonstrate the capability
to reduce and manage deviant sexual urges and fantasies.
The perpetrator must also identify his or her individual cycle of
offense, develop a protection plan, and share the plan with those

[p. <i>456</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00476&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Other Interventions</i>


To complement cognitive treatment, the polygraph, plethysmograph,
arousal gauges such as the Abel Screen, psychopharmacologic
interventions, or all these should be used. These interventions
are not used in place of treatment but, rather, as an adjunct
to treatment. Furthermore, treatment programs should choose
which external device will be used to monitor the perpetrator's
deviant fantasies and behaviors.


The polygraph can elicit information regarding thoughts,
arousals, and behaviors. There are three types of examinations:
sexual history, specific issue, and monitoring. The sexual history
examination focuses on the perpetrator's sexual history and his
or her victimizations, perpetrations, and consensual encounters.
The specific issue examination addresses specific allegations,
behaviors, events, or all three. The monitoring examination is a
periodic examination of the perpetrator's compliance with treatment,
probation, child welfare, or all three.


The plethysmograph is an assessment of sexual arousal and
provides objective data regarding sexual preferences. It can assist
in monitoring changes in patterns of sexual arousal. The plethysmograph
measures erection response to sexually explicit slides
and audio sexual material.


The Abel Screen is a computer-driven instrument. Through
self-report, the perpetrator acknowledges his or her sexual preferences
to slides of various stimuli presented. This is supplemented
by a comprehensive questionnaire that the perpetrator
completes that addresses the sexual and paraphiliac history.


Psychopharmacologic intervention and medications can assist
in the management of sexually abusive and violent behaviors.
Medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,
antianxiety agents, antiandrogens, and stimulants can be
advantageous to sexual perpetrators' intervention. Such intervention
should not be routinely prescribed to all perpetrators but
rather used on an individual basis.

[p. <i>457</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00477&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Visitation</i>


Because child safety is a priority in perpetrator intervention, in
cases of incest the sexual perpetrator should be removed from his
or her residence. Removal of the perpetrator is more suitable than
removal of the children. The exception to this practice is when
the nonoffending parent will not protect the children. Likewise,
the perpetrator, incestuous or extrafamilial, should be restricted
from having access to and unsupervised visitation with any
children.


Supervised visitation should be authorized only when all
family members have successfully engaged in treatment and the
perpetrator has demonstrated the ability to control his or her
deviant thoughts, arousal, and behaviors. Contact should not be
recommended unless the child's therapist has determined it to be
in the best interest of the child, and the nonoffending parent's
therapist can conclude that the nonoffending parent can provide
appropriate supervision.


? <i>Reunification</i>


Reunification should be determined only by the interdisciplinary
team when the perpetrator and all the family members have
successfully completed the intervention(s). Perpetrators are always
at risk to reoffend; approximately 20% do so.


Although family preservation impacts the professionals' interventions,
the child's protection should remain at the forefront of
decision making. The individual perpetrator's recovery and risk
should be factored heavily into the decision for reunification.

Studies of treatment or intervention in the area of child
physical abuse (CPA) have generally examined alternative
approaches to modifying an adult's abusive or coercive
behavior (National Academy of Sciences, 1998). Most of the
treatment models for CPA consider the importance of parental
behavior and the reciprocal influences between parents and
children. Indeed, interventions in this area often target the care-giver
given the expectation that adult behavior change will result
in improved child functioning and protection. The importance
of parental involvement in treatment is based on studies that have
identified specific parental or adult factors related to abusive
behavior, such as social isolation, parental distress, and poor
parenting skills or child development knowledge. Furthermore,
clinical impressions and outcome studies suggest the benefits of
parent-directed treatments, such as individual parent counseling
and education, parent support groups, family therapy, and in-home
services. These interventions may promote abilities to
inhibit abusive behavior and minimize the psychological effects
of abusive interactions. Of course, parent-directed methods to
eliminate abusive behavior need to be supplemented with child-directed
services (Kolko, 1998).

[p. <i>460</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00480&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Common Problems and Intervention Approaches</i>


Adult-directed interventions often emphasize parent training in
various psychosocial skills, such as the use of contingency management
procedures, nonviolent discipline, and self-management
procedures together with clinical or support services (e.g., self-help
groups and child development information). Parent training
using cognitive-behavioral techniques has been associated with
improvement in both parent (e.g., child abuse potential and
depression) and child (e.g., behavior problems).


<i>
<b>Anger</b>
</i>


Problems with anger management have been reported in many
abusive parents. To address this problem, parents can be taught
anger management skills to replace hostile or negative behavior
with more positive and constructive strategies. This usually involves
identifying the internal and external "triggers" of anger,
examining and challenging the types of distorted or exaggerated
thoughts that may precipitate angry responses, teaching progressive
muscle relaxation (e.g., push down on the arm of a chair for
5 seconds and then relax), and recommending alternative "coping
self-statements" (e.g., "I'm in control, not my child") or other
responses to enhance self-control when angry. More general stress
management skills may be needed to minimize negative emotional
reactions to the parent's adverse circumstances. Teaching
empathy is a related method that may enhance a parent's ability
to appreciate alternative perspectives regarding a problem situation.
Thus, both emotional and cognitive change methods can
be used to improve self-control. These skills can be taught on an
individual and group basis. Training involves coaching, role plays,
and subsequent performance feedback.


<i>
<b>Impulse-Control Problems</b>
</i>


Impulse-control problems can be addressed using anger-control
procedures, but parents may also need to learn more
prosocial methods for solving problems that minimize impulsive
responses. Several skills may be taught in solving specific problems:
Parents should be taught to (a) identify goals, (b) clearly

[p. <i>461</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00481&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Harsh or Punitive Discipline</b>
</i>


The next target for treatment involves providing parents with
alternatives to punitive discipline. Initially, one can ask all family
members, not just the parent, to comply with a "no physical force
or discipline" contract. Specialized training in appropriate parenting
techniques, such as effective discipline and child management,
is commonly used to enhance parental control and use of
more appropriate discipline (Schellenbach, 1998). Such training
may teach parents how to attend to their children appropriately
while ignoring disruptive behavior, praise or reinforce their good
behavior (e.g., say something nice after the behavior), withhold
privileges (e.g., identify a problem behavior, determine what may
be withheld, warn the child before the privilege is withheld), and
administer time-outs following inappropriate behavior. An example
is the removal of a child from an enjoyable activity for a brief,
specified amount of time. Once skills training has been conducted,
specific home programs can be developed to target
individual child and family problems. Treatment may be facilitated
if both general principles and specific techniques are taught
to help parents learn how to generalize their disciplinary skills to
new problems. Both individual and group approaches have been
determined to be effective in teaching alternative discipline skills.
Many clinical programs have parenting groups that provide
in-depth instruction in the application of specific behavior management
skills, and there are many publications describing these
parenting skills in basic, friendly language.


<i>
<b>Social Isolation and Skill Deficits</b>
</i>


Given deficiencies or problems in social competence, it is
often important to enhance the interpersonal or communication

[p. <i>462</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00482&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Family Dysfunction and Stress</b>
</i>


Practitioners may determine that training in the previously
discussed areas can be effectively conducted in various contexts,
such as individual, parent-child, and group settings; in some
instances, however, parallel child and parent treatment may be
helpful. Coercive parents who need to develop more positive
relationships with their children and to learn appropriate parenting
techniques may benefit from "coaching" sessions that offer
feedback during or after observed parent-child interactions. In
addition to learning new skills, some parents may benefit from
involvement in family and social support interventions that address
dysfunctional family processes, such as teaching their family
how to communicate positively or to strengthen extrafamilial
contacts. In a recent study, parent treatment addressed their
perception of the child's abuse experience, risk factors for abuse,
stress management, anger control, child development, cognitive
distortions and therapy, nonviolent discipline, and home programs
(Kolko, 1996).


Other services may be appropriate for the entire family, such
as advocacy with local agencies or services, life skills training,
home management and safety, and social support interventions,
some of which address problems in the parent-child relationship
and the parent's attachment to the child (Schellenbach, 1998).
Sometimes, general but relevant information may be helpful to
the family, such as that on self-management (e.g., decision-making
and observation skills), health and safety (e.g., taking medicines
and home and community safety), and parent-child interaction
skills (e.g., playing together). Helping parents attend to family

[p. <i>463</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00483&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Other Treatment Options and Considerations</i>


Parental treatment or counseling may help parents control abusive
behavior and support their children in coping with the effects
of abuse. Effective treatment often involves teaching psychological
skills that enhance social or adaptive competence and directly
address parental symptoms or related psychiatric dysfunction. It
is also important to recognize the potential benefits of including
other family members in treatment on improving family outcomes
and relationships. In general, studies of parent-directed
treatments have reported beneficial outcomes on parental control
or coercive behaviors, parental distress, family relations and
cohesion, and child behavior. These goals may be promoted when
interventions incorporate these components in the context of
ongoing family work.


Regardless of the types of service provided, efforts to enhance
treatment engagement and compliance may influence the likelihood
of a positive treatment outcome. As such, child protection
services workers are encouraged to routinely monitor the effects
of treatment to understand client response and to identify clinical
obstacles to improvement. Families presenting with serious parental
or family dysfunction and frequent violent behavior may
require referral for more intensive clinical services. Indeed, many
parents who participate in treatment may still not show sufficient
improvement or even a positive response to intervention. Only
careful treatment planning and monitoring can maximize the
likelihood that parental interventions will minimize their abusive
behavior and promote the welfare of their children.

Depression is a serious psychiatric illness characterized by
feelings of sadness and hopelessness that may be accompanied
by poor appetite or overeating, changes in sleep,
low energy or fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration, difficulty
making decisions, and recurrent thoughts of death. As a
psychiatric diagnosis, it is called dysthymic disorder in its milder
form and major depressive disorder (MDD) in its more severe
form. The public health importance of MDD is underscored by
how life threatening it is and its commonness. As many as 15%
of its sufferers die by suicide. Current lifetime prevalence of
MDD among woman is estimated to be between 10% and 25%
and from 5% to 12% for men. Conditions that may be confused
with MDD because of shared symptoms include normal grieving,
various medical conditions, and substance abuse disorders.


Recognizing depression is particularly important because
treatment can dramatically decrease the suffering of depressed
persons. Effective treatments include behavioral, cognitive, and
interpersonal psychotherapies; antidepressant medications; and
electroconvulsive treatment.


Regardless of which treatment is initially selected, studies
suggest that only 45% to 55% of depressed outpatients will
respond to initial treatment. Therefore, it is important that

[p. <i>466</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00486&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is no single treatment that is most effective for all cases
of depression. The first step toward effective treatment is a careful
diagnostic evaluation that matches the patients' needs to the most
appropriate available treatment. After treatment is initiated, the
patient's progress should be monitored and the treatment adjusted
or changed, as needed, in a timely manner. Once depression
is recognized, suicide assessment and prevention are a priority.
(See Chapter 23 for information on screening caregivers'
dangerousness to themselves or their children.)


? <i>Psychotherapies</i>


<b>
<i>Time-Limited Psychosocial Therapy</i>
</b>


Interpersonal (IPT), cognitive (CT), and behavioral (BT)
psychotherapies have been specifically developed and studied
with depressed patients. Each has demonstrated effectiveness on
a level similar to that of antidepressant medication.


IPT focuses on improving a depressed person's relationships
with others, and CT seeks to change negative thoughts. BT begins
with an assessment of the relationship between identified problems,
underdeveloped skills, and the depressive symptoms. A
stepwise plan for treatment is developed, and desired behavior
change is socially reinforced as the behavior is gradually shaped
in the desired direction.


<b>
<i>Psychodynamic Therapy</i>
</b>


Psychodynamic therapy uses psychoanalytic theories and
principles developed by Freud and many others. Although not as
well researched as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy
for depression, it is believed that some depressed patients may
benefit from this approach, which focuses on unconscious conflicts,
depleted self-esteem, and problems related to early life
experiences with caregivers.

[p. <i>467</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00487&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Abuse-Focused Therapy</i>
</b>


Abuse-focused therapy addresses various problems, including
depression and relationship difficulties, often associated with
childhood abuse experiences. Like psychodynamic therapy, with
which it shares an emphasis on the importance of early life
experiences, abuse-focused therapy for depression has not been
subjected to many controlled research studies. There are many
different approaches to abuse-focused therapy, some of which
incorporate cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapeutic
techniques.


? <i>Biological Treatments</i>


<b>
<i>Antidepressant Medication</i>
</b>


Current antidepressant medications include several different
classes of drugs that act on brain messenger chemicals involved
in mood regulation and response to stress. These classes of drugs
are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of which Prozac
is the most famous and widely prescribed. There are other
medications, including stimulants and anticonvulsants, that may
also be useful for treating some depressions.


<b>
<i>Electroconvulsive Therapy</i>
</b>


Despite its negative portrayal in popular media, electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) remains an important treatment for severe
depression, especially for medication-resistant or medication-intolerant
patients. Technical advances, including the use of
general anesthesia, muscle relaxation, oxygen administration to
patients before inducing convulsions, brief pulse duration, unilateral
electrode placement, and seizure monitoring, make the
current ECT a safer and more acceptable treatment for severe
depression than earlier ECT methods.

[p. <i>468</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00488&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Combined Therapy</i>


There is little evidence that one mode of treatment is markedly
superior to other modes described previously for the initial
treatment of depression. Combining a properly selected and
skillfully conducted psychotherapy along with appropriate anti-depressant
medication may offer broader treatment for the many
symptoms and problems associated with depression and is often
the best approach for severe and chronic cases of depression.


? <i>Screening Questions</i>


The following questions are derived from the Beck Depression
Inventory, a well-researched instrument for measuring the presence
and severity of depression. The more "yes" responses and
clear descriptions of these symptoms a client gives, the more likely
it is that he or she is depressed and should be referred to a mental
health care provider.


• Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?


• Have you been feeling more negatively about yourself?


• Have you been crying more than usual?


• Have you recently lost interest in other people or things
you used to like to do?


• Has your sleeping, appetite, or energy level changed?


• Have you had any thoughts of harming or killing yourself?


Because depression is a common, disabling, and potentially
fatal illness, child protective workers who screen clients and find
indicators of depression should refer these individuals to mental
health care providers.

? <i>"Political" Aspects of Intervention</i>


The use of power in any relationship politicizes that relationship.
During the past two decades, legislation has been influenced by
the grassroots activism of women advocating for the protection
of women from physical and sexual abuse by their intimate male
partners. Feminist theorists accentuate societal tolerance and
support for male violence toward women. Efforts to raise societal
awareness of woman abuse has resulted in increased awareness
of battering and abusiveness by women toward men, by partners
in same-sex relationships, and by couples in dating relationships.
Since the late 1970s, all states have implemented laws and services
affording victims of domestic violence protection and support.
Victims of violence usually seek treatment voluntarily, most often
bringing their children for treatment with them. Because domestic
violence affects children of all ages, interventions must consider
their service needs. Batterers are more likely to be in
treatment as a result of some form of legal involvement that requires
their participation in treatment, usually for a time-limited
period.

[p. <i>471</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00491&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Traditional Approaches to Intervention</i>


Cognitive and psychoeducational treatment comprise traditional
approaches to intervention with family violence. Providing information
about the dynamics of domestic violence, providing
instruction about legal options, raising consciousness about nonviolence
in relationships, and providing anger management are
examples of such approaches. Multimodal treatment, which
includes individual and group therapy, is used. Treatment must
focus on topics germane to domestic violence. Scant research
exists to definitively support specific treatment approaches. Couples'
therapy is generally contraindicated because it is viewed as
a potential threat to the victim of domestic violence. Recent
literature emphasizes the importance of safety as the precursor
for genuine therapeutic intervention. All intervention should
begin with assessment (see Chapter 74, this volume). Traditional
approaches to additional intervention with the adult victim (in
child welfare contexts--usually the mother), the child(ren), and
the batterer or abuser are as follows:


Intervening with the adult victim (usually the mother)


• Support the woman's autonomy to the fullest extent
possible.


• Provide information about legal and clinical services that
support safety, separation, and change.


• Address and engage family, community, and social resources.


• Understand that interventions are cumulative, and failed
separations may precede a lasting one.


• Describe any apparent connections between domestic
violence and its effects on children.


• Inform the mother of safety concerns regarding children
and the reality of alternatives for the family.


• Offer suggestions free from judgments, especially for
mothers who do not separate--there may be very good
reasons why they do not.


• Refer the mother to domestic violence treatment centers,
and encourage her participation in groups with other

Intervening with children


• Provide a referral to group counseling with children of
similar age and circumstance.


• Focus treatment on labeling feelings (especially anger),
building safety skills, gaining support from others, understanding
the dynamics of family violence as appropriate
to age level, and relief of perceived responsibility for
having caused or for having to end the violence.


• Individualize assessment and treatment for symptomatic
behavior, particularly provocative or aggressive behaviors,
compulsive caretaking, posttraumatic stress disorder,
and excessive fears or anxieties.


Intervening with batterers and abusers


• Provide immediate protection for adult victim and children,
including using legal sanctions (arrest, probation,
imprisonment, etc.), supports, and safety planning (ex
parte).


• Modify and monitor abuses of power and control as well
as physical and sexual battery.


• Assess and provide appropriate treatment for alcohol and
other drug problems.


• Provide professionally led, structured, long-term group
therapy with other batterers and abusers.


• Carefully monitor progress with regular reporting to
appropriate authorities.


• Promote self-assessment of violent behavior, development
of personal responsibility for nonviolent relating,
and relapse prevention--all keys to successful outcomes.


• Refrain from showing too much caring, which is perceived
as weakness and invites manipulation.


• Focus on concern for the effects of his behavior on his
goals for himself, his wife, and family.

? <i>Implications for Child Welfare</i>


Staff should be familiar with the indicators of domestic violence
and be capable of safely conducting initial screening and assessment
interviews. Batterers are likely to resist the intervention of
professionals or agencies or to appear to comply on the surface.
Many batterers have threatened their adult victims by telling
them that child welfare intervention will lead to the placement
of their children. Women need to be reassured that family preservation
is a guiding principle for child welfare service delivery.
Child welfare staff need to recognize that their intervention,
especially pressure on the woman to separate, may increase the
risk of violence to the adult victim and the children to dangerous,
even lethal, levels. If the mother elects to remain with a man who
abuses her, this may be a realistic recognition of the dangers that
separation would pose for her and her child(ren). This should not
automatically be viewed as inherently neglectful on her part. The
family unit to be considered for preservation is the mother with
her children. In situations in which the batterer expresses remorse,
accepts full responsibility for his behavior, has worked in
therapy toward change and relapse prevention, and has demonstrated
a commitment to nonviolence in relating, it may be
possible to consider preservation or reunification of the entire
family unit. It is critical to partner with domestic violence professionals
and agencies in the community as soon as domestic
violence has been identified.

Addiction treatment has four main goals:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. To educate the addict or alcoholic about the nature and
dynamics of addiction: This replaces the addict's myths and
misconceptions about addiction with accurate information.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. To encourage self-diagnosis as an addicted person: Once the
addict views him- or herself as sick and in need of treatment,
motivation and compliance increase.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. To involve the addict in an ongoing program of treatment
and self-help: Addiction is chronic and requires continued
supervision and relapse prevention.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. To encourage the recovering addict to assume personal
responsibility for his or her recovery: Addicts must renounce
their long-standing practice of blaming outside forces or
circumstances for their drug use.

Treatment modalities for addictions include the following:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Detoxification</i> involves medical care during the period of
acute withdrawal. Depending on the severity of withdrawal,
detoxification may occur in a hospital, in a
community clinic or residential setting, or on an outpatient
basis under a physician's supervision. Detoxification
may be a short-term process (e.g., for alcohol)
or an extended one (e.g., for methadone).
</p>
<p>
<i>Inpatient rehabilitation:</i> Once the staple of addiction treatment,
extended inpatient rehabilitation stays have
been dramatically reduced by managed care. Currently,
such stays are ordinarily confined to cases with complicating
factors, such as comorbid severe psychiatric
disorders.
</p>
<p>
<i>Intensive outpatient</i> involves structured, multiple-hour
therapy sessions, usually several evenings per week, for
a month or longer.
</p>
<p>
<i>Partial hospitalization or day treatment</i> are alternatives to
inpatient rehabilitation that require daily attendance
for a variety of therapeutic activities until the parent is
stable enough to enter outpatient counseling.
</p>
<p>
<i>Outpatient counseling</i> involves ongoing treatment, usually
weekly, for an hour or more.
</p>
<p>
<i>Long-term residential programs</i> are for those requiring
continued structure and supervision to maintain recovery.
</p>

Treatment modalities for addictions include medical care,
psychoeducation, individual counseling, addictions case management,
group therapy, discharge planning, family education, relapse
prevention education, and exposure to self-help fellowships.
Most addiction clinicians prefer a cognitive-behavioral
approach based on the premise that addiction is a chronic and
progressive disorder requiring prompt intervention and ongoing
treatment.


? <i>The Double-Abuse Group</i>


Addicted caregivers present additional challenges to the child
protection professional. Most addiction treatment programs do

[p. <i>476</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00496&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To avoid this problem, we recommend "double-abuse groups,"
in which the members are selected for their involvement in child
maltreatment and drug or alcohol abuse and the leader is skilled
in the treatment of both. This makes the group homogeneous on
two levels, promoting honest self-disclosure and support and
positive bonding regarding the larger task of double recovery.


Our double-abuse groups meet once weekly for 2 hours
during a 16-week period. Client defenses are remarkably similar
for both disorders. Many begin in severe denial of one or both
problems. Other common defenses include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Rationalization: "I was under stress" (which excuses my
drug use/neglect of my child).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Externalizing: "I wouldn't have slapped the child/gotten
loaded on drugs if my wife hadn't made me so angry."
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Minimizing: "My drug use/child abuse wasn't as bad as
they said."
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Undoing: "No matter what I do, I always make it up to
the child later."
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
The group setting permits the leader and the other members to
isolate and confront these defenses effectively.


• Rationalization: "I was under stress" (which excuses my
drug use/neglect of my child).


• Externalizing: "I wouldn't have slapped the child/gotten
loaded on drugs if my wife hadn't made me so angry."


• Minimizing: "My drug use/child abuse wasn't as bad as
they said."


• Undoing: "No matter what I do, I always make it up to
the child later."


Although outcome studies are incomplete, anecdotal reports
from the first double-abuse group have been promising. A year
after completion, there were no reported cases of additional child
maltreatment, and 80% of the parents appeared to be in stable
recovery from addiction.

Family therapy is a way of working with people that views
the interactions among family members as contributing to
and maintaining individual and family dysfunction. Child
maltreatment is a sign of family dysfunction. In part, maltreatment
may occur because family members have been unable to set
proper boundaries between themselves, negotiate the handling of
new developmental stages, or cope with external demands (loss
of job, crowded living conditions, etc.). The treatment of choice
for child maltreatment may be family therapy. Family therapy,
based on a systems approach, considers the child and the other
family members as being linked, with each family member's
behavior affecting everyone else's. Within this context, assessment
of the whole family is crucial in understanding the experiences
of the child. Also important, interventions must be designed
that include the whole family.


Family therapy is often more thorough than individual therapy
because the assessment process includes more people. It can
be carried out more quickly than individual therapy because more
people are involved in seeking a solution to the family problems.
Finally, it is often more effective because interventions affect
more people.

? <i>Treatment</i>


Once a decision is made about which family members to include
in treatment (it may not be possible to include everyone due to
scheduling conflicts, refusal to come for treatment, or the deleterious
influence that a family member may have on the family),
the following approaches may be attempted:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Positive reinforcement:</i> The therapist actively reinforces
the behaviors that are appropriate to the needs of the
family; through this process, self-esteem is built.
</p>
<p>
<i>Insight:</i> Family members are helped to understand their
own behavior and how this behavior has led to difficulties
in the family.
</p>
<p>
<i>Parent education:</i> The family learns both alternative methods
of interacting and appropriate developmental expectations
for children.
</p>
<p>
<i>Appropriate boundaries:</i> The therapist emphasizes that
when parents and children are overly close or overly
distant, problems develop.
</p>
<p>
<i>Reframe:</i> The family is taught a new way of thinking about
their situation that can lead to other options for behavior.
Families often start treatment with a fixed view of
themselves and benefit when this view is changed.
</p>
<p>
<i>The therapeutic relationship:</i> The therapist connects with
the family. No intervention will be successful unless the
professional has established a working relationship
with the family members.
</p>
</blockquote>

Family therapy in cases of abuse can be a powerful method of
assessment and treatment. It is strongly recommended when
family members are willing to work together to solve the problem
and are able to discuss past mistakes. It is not always appropriate,
however. If a child is afraid of a parent or if there is a high level
of secrecy or denial in the family, family therapy can be counterproductive.
Individual or group therapy are recommended in
such cases.

Working with the biological families of children placed
in foster care is becoming more complex because child
abuse and neglect of children by their parents have
increased dramatically due to societal problems such as unemployment,
poverty, family violence, drug abuse, alcoholism, and
homelessness. As the challenge of helping children in foster care
and their families has thus intensified, there is throughout the
country evidence of creative and potentially effective efforts by
social workers to support biological families. This chapter reviews
the key components of these programs.


? <i>Focus on the Family</i>


The first and foremost component in service delivery is a family-centered
orientation--that is, considering the birth family as the
central unit or focus of attention. Such an orientation involves in
particular the following:

[p. <i>482</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00502&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Placing the child in a foster home or residential setting
that is close to the family--geographically and culturally
and racially


• Making case decisions that help strengthen parent-child
relationships and maximize the potential for eventual
reunification of the child with his or her family


• Maintaining and supporting ongoing and regular contacts
between the child and the parents and other members of
the immediate family as well as the extended kinship
network


• Helping the children to understand the events that led to
placement and to reestablish a relationship that better
meets their needs for safety and nurturance


• Supporting the parents in their efforts to cope with their
own life challenges and enhance their own functioning


? <i>Mobilizing Parental Motivation</i>


When faced with separation from their children and the threat
of losing their parental rights, many parents can be helped to
become motivated to work on their problems and accomplish
reunification with their children. Strategies that have been found
to be effective in this connection include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Identifying and building on the parents' concern for and
attachment to the child
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Clarifying for parents the real threat of termination of
parental rights
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Facilitating the family's ongoing involvement with the
child through a range of creative means
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Providing supports to the parents as human beings who
are entitled to help in their own right
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Using the child's placement as a therapeutic tool to promote
changes in the child and family and to maintain and
enhance their sense of connectedness with each other
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Showing confidence in the parents' potential to grow and
encouraging them to believe in themselves and their
strengths and potentialities

? <i>Forming a Partnership With Parents</i>


The family-centered focus and the emphasis on mobilizing parental
motivation lead to the importance of forming a partnership
among biological parents and other family members, foster parents
or other caregivers, and social workers and other professionals.
In particular, foster care services should involve parents and
other family members as partners in the helping process as much
as possible.


Although the involvement of parents is widely accepted in
theory, it is difficult to implement in practice because of problems
and challenges presented by parents, societal and professional
bias against parents who are accused of child abuse and neglect,
and organizational and service impediments such as limited
funding. Guidelines for forming and sustaining an effective partnership
with parents include:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Shifting from a view of parents as being inadequate or
carriers of pathology to a belief that many of them can
change and grow if provided with adequate attention and
help
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Viewing parents, as much as possible, as colleagues or
partners in the change process
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Using tools such as the contract or service agreement to
clarify the respective roles of parents and practitioners
and make joint decisions about case planning and goal
formulation
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Regarding foster parents and child care personnel as
partners in the provision of service, as members of the
service team, and as resources for parents through such
means as role modeling, serving as parent aides, or providing
respite care for the children

? <i>Providing Comprehensive Services and Supports</i>


Given the multiple and complex needs of families brought to the
attention of child welfare workers, another major component of

[p. <i>484</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00504&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Combining "soft" services, such as counseling, with
"hard" services, such as income assistance and day care


• Providing informal supports, such as parent aides, volunteers,
and recreational opportunities, for parents and
children


• Using parent training and other educational opportunities
to help parents become more competent


• Encouraging parents to become involved in self-help
groups such as Parents Anonymous, which can enhance
the parents' self-esteem and parenting skills


• Supporting the parents' involvement in advocacy and
social action on their behalf


? <i>Collaborating With Service Providers</i>


Helping parents and children involved in foster care requires the
services of several systems, especially income maintenance, law
and juvenile justice, health and mental health, and education.
There are successful programs in child welfare that regularly
convene interagency, interdisciplinary teams for training, goal
planning, and service implementation. These programs demonstrate
principles such as the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Facilitating coordination of services through such means
as appointing a case manager
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Clarifying and delegating roles and functions of team
members on behalf of each family
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Enhancing the parents' skills in dealing with representatives
of diverse agencies and systems
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Evaluating and revising planning in each case through
periodic meetings or consultation
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Selecting and implementing a safe, permanent plan for
the child

? <i>Assessing Readiness for Reunification</i>


In regard to implementation of a permanent plan, practitioners
face the challenge of determining whether and when the child
and family are ready to be reunited. Unless otherwise indicated,
family reunification is regarded as the most desirable choice of
permanent plan in most cases. In assessing the advisability of
reunification in a particular case, practitioners and family members
need to consider many critical questions, including the
following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Have the conditions that originally led to the child's
placement been satisfactorily resolved?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Do the quality and outcome of parent-child visiting indicate
readiness for reunification?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can the child's safety be ensured while also respecting
family integrity and autonomy?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can the risk of returning a child to the family be balanced
with the risk inherent in prolonging the child's stay in
foster care?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can supports be put in place through the extended family
or community or both to maintain the reunification?
</p>

? <i>Case Example</i>


The following case example illustrates the principles and strategies
presented in this chapter:
<blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Franklin's physical abuse of his wife, witnessed 3 years
ago by his then 5-year-old son, Andy, resulted in a restraining
order prohibiting contact between the parents. The father's
visits with Andy during the next 2 years were sporadic and
often unwelcomed by the boy. The mother died suddenly 1
year ago, and guardianship was given to the maternal aunt,
whose rage at the father reinforced Andy's negative image of
him. Following the mother's death, Mr. Franklin expressed a
renewed commitment to become a part of his son's life. Andy,
however, refused to see his father and would tell all who

would listen that he never wanted to see him again. Mr.
Franklin then contacted a social worker for help in reuniting
with his son.

[p. <i>486</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00506&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Following interviews with all parties, the social worker
came to view the boy's rage at his father as a wish for some
form of attachment to him. She worked with the father to help
him write a series of letters to Andy in which, over time, he
claimed responsibility for his past actions, apologized and
asked for his son's forgiveness, and expressed his love for
Andy and his wish to reconnect with him. The social worker
sat with Andy during the reading of each letter to help him
process his feelings and clarify issues. After several months,
Andy's attitude began to soften, and he asked his father,
through the social worker, to address specific topics in future
letters.


At the same time, the social worker met with the aunt to
enhance her capacity to help Andy act on his feelings of
interest in his father. In addition, the social worker contacted
Mr. Franklin's mother, who had not seen Andy since the
restraining order had originally been issued, and arranged for
visits to begin between Andy and his grandmother.


Through the process of letter writing, Mr. Franklin came
to understand how much he had frightened Andy with his fits
of temper, and he was helped by the social worker to enroll
in an anger management course. Initially, it was difficult for
Mr. Franklin to see the extent to which his anger alienated his
son; bolstered by the social worker's genuine efforts to help
him reconnect with Andy, however, he came to see her as a
partner and ally and began to address his own rage.


After nearly 1 year of work, Mr. Franklin and Andy have
begun weekly supervised visits, which the aunt occasionally
attends. This provides the social worker with the opportunity
to continue to forge an alliance between these two important
adults in Andy's life. Plans are under way to extend visits to
full days, with the eventual goal of reunification.

To assist children and their biological families effectively, it is
urgent to acknowledge their multiple and diverse needs and
provide comprehensive as well as intensive services prior to,

The core belief underlying the importance of visitation is
that consistency and high frequency of visits are predictive
of successful reunification. The following are useful strategies
for facilitating visitation:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Prepare for visits: Both foster and birth parents need to
know that visiting is stressful, and that children may act
out behaviorally as a "result of anger, grief, or other
feelings. In addition, birth parents may need concrete
assistance in making arrangements to visit. It is extremely
difficult for children when their birth parents do not
attend a scheduled visit. Children also need clarification
about the "rules" for visits so that their expectations are
realistic. For instance, children should be told the location
and duration of visits.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Use visits as part of ongoing assessment: Use visits to assess
the quality of parent-child interaction, communication
</p><p>[p. <i>489</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00509&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
patterns, roles, rules, strengths, concerns, and overall
progress. For instance, parents can plan ahead to use
discipline rather than corporal punishment during the
next visit and then can rate themselves on their success
with this objective.

• Use visits to maintain and increase attachment: Birth
parents should be encouraged to meet their children's
emotional and physical needs during visitation because
these activities enhance attachment.


• Use visits to help parents and children deal with their
feelings: Often, it is helpful to end visits with a "review"
of both birth parents' and children's feelings about the
visit and progress toward reunification. Also, it may be
helpful to use tools, such as life books, pictures, and
videos taken during visits, to talk about feelings.


• Use visits to help birth parents practice new skills in a
supportive environment: Although visitation is not the
same as living together, it is important to set up visitation
that, to the extent possible, approximates "real-life" parenting.
For instance, birth parents could shop with their
children for school supplies to practice both meeting
needs and limit setting.


• Use visits to identify and reduce fantasies about reunification:
Clarifying goals and objectives with birth parents
and children together will help parents accept their responsibilities.
Children often blame themselves for being
in care and, particularly when they are younger, use
magical thinking in trying to understand reunification.
Like their birth parents, children will benefit from clear
statements of goals and objectives in behavioral terms.


• Following visits, process the outcomes: It is important to
process visits with foster parents and birth parents. For
instance, after discussing a visit, you may decide to accelerate
or decelerate the pace of visits, change the duration
or location of visits, and so on. Also, in these discussions
the foster parents and birth parents can work together to
deal with challenging behaviors that the children may
exhibit during or after visitation.

The following is an approach to maximize emergency funding
resources and build families' financial management
skills:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Self-assess:</i> To adequately support families to develop and
use financial management skills, the worker must first
develop empathy for the family in crisis. This involves
examining his or her own feelings, attitudes, and experiences
about financial crises. This is the first step to
"tune in" to what the client is experiencing so that the
worker may successfully engage the family to develop
solutions (see Chapter 8, this volume). Regarding financial
crises, families may try to deny or minimize
their situations because of embarrassment. Workers
can be more successful if clients perceive that they
display a nonjudgmental attitude. Being self-aware is
an important ingredient in this process.

motivation to change reinforced at every opportunity
(see Chapter 68, this volume).

intervention should be monitored carefully and

[p. <i>492</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00512&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Determine what the family wants to do to address the
immediate crisis:</i> Change cannot be forced on a family.
Family-generated solutions to financial management
concerns should be elicited, family strengths engaged,
and intervention leveraged to resolve financial crises.
Self-direction, planning, and resolution of ambivalence
to change by family caregivers promotes change. Identification
of partial solutions and exceptions to crisis
development will assist the worker and family to engage
in a solution-focused planning and intervention
process. For example, what is the family's plan to
address the crisis? How do the caregiver and family
want to proceed? How has the caregiver resolved
similar crises in the past? What partial successes can be
identified? When a crisis did not occur in the past, what
strategies did the caregiver and family use? What family
strengths can be identified and used to meet the
crisis? Who can support and assist the caregiver in the
kinship and neighborhood network?


<i>Use emergency funding resources to address immediate
crisis needs:</i> Crisis intervention skills and flexible funds
are needed to calm family emotions, codirect family
response to crisis, and provide immediate emergency
resources. The following are questions to consider:
Does your agency have an emergency resource directory?
Does the directory include churches, emergency
food, and shelter resources; specialty resources for new
baby needs; utility resources; and cash? Have all family
and extended family resources been considered by the
caregiver? Are petty cash or flexible funds available?


<i>Strengthen family motivation:</i> Once the immediate crisis
has been addressed, the focus of attention turns to
strengthening family motivation for change, developing
family strengths, involving family and extended
family resources, and creating with family involvement
an action plan to learning financial management skills
and prevent recurring financial crisis. It is also important
to identify barriers to success. For example, are
monies being spent on drugs or alcohol? Are family

[p. <i>493</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00513&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Develop family crisis recognition and response skills:</i> Family
crisis recognition and response skills can be developed
by identifying family values and goals and by
assisting the family in recognizing signs and patterning
of crises. Use of crisis and value cards clarifies family
needs and patterns of response. A written response
action plan can be developed to detail steps to be taken
to avert crisis and enlist key support.


<i>Teach financial management and budget skills:</i> A money
planner and budget sheets can be used to identify
family income, needs, undisclosed expenditures, and
family priorities. The worker should teach skills in
small steps and demonstrate and rehearse skills with
the caregiver or family member. Repeated skill building
of budget management skills, with positive reinforcement
of family efforts, is required. Attention to
family emotional issues and sensitivity to gender and
cultural differences among families regarding money
management are critical. Sample areas to explore include
the following: How is money currently spent?
What are the family's priorities? What income is available
to the family or in need of development?


<i>Troubleshoot the budget with the family:</i> By troubleshooting
the budget with the family, financial skills can be
sharpened and additional areas of need and family
strength can be developed. Once the caregiver has
learned budgeting skills, help the caregiver and family
to troubleshoot the budget. What types of expenses
typically occur in this family that explode the budget?
Holiday gifts? Kin or relationship needs? Impulse purchase?
Explore with the caregiver how crises have
occurred and what safeguards can be built into the
budget. Provide examples of how to use weekly accounting
to manage resources. Consider whether there

[p. <i>494</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00514&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Link to additional helping resources:</i> Linkage to a helping
resource is not the same as referral. Connection of the
family to family, neighborhood, and service helping
resources will require assessment of the family's readiness
to receive such resources and of barriers that may
prevent the family linkage and follow-up to ensure that
linkage has been achieved and help received by the
family. What additional helping resources may this
family require? How close are these resources located
to the neighborhood in which the family lives? What
transportation arrangements may be needed? What
efforts will be needed to ensure that linkage occurs and
the family receives the resources it may need to prevent
an additional crisis?


<i>Evaluate outcomes:</i> Ask the family how they will know
when their financial management skills have improved
and financial stability has been obtained. As the intervention
concludes, what objective outcomes can be
documented? Is this because there has been no financial
crisis in 2 months or because the caregiver was able to
find emergency resources on his or her own? What
evidence is there that the family has learned, and is
practicing, financial management and self-sufficiency
skills?


? <i>Summary</i>


The goals in child protection practice are to support and
strengthen the family, increase family resilience, ensure children's
safety, and reduce the risk of out-of-home placement. To maximize
emergency funding resources and build families' financial
management skills, we need to work with the family to identify
strengths and needs, use these strengths to formulate with the
family measurable goals, develop and implement a written action
plan, teach financial management skills, link to additional helping
resources, and document objective outcomes achieved.

[p. <i>495</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00515&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For most maltreatment cases, no single agency, including the
child protection agency, can meet the full range of needs of
the family and child. Child protection workers play a vital
role in assessing needs, finding others who can assist in building
on family strengths and addressing areas of concern, and in
building coalitions of helping professionals and others. These key
players in the helping system may be drawn from the formal
helping system of professionals, such as therapists, parenting
aides, teaching homemakers, teachers, physicians, and substance
abuse or domestic violence counselors, and from the natural
informal helping network of family members, church members,
neighbors, and others. The worker can craft a mix of interveners
who, when working in concert, can have a powerful influence on
family behavior. Such power, however, requires coordination.
Without coordination, the mix of service providers can work at
cross-purposes and even interfere with progress.


To best manage an intervention process, which involves a
variety of service providers and informal helpers, the worker
must determine in what circumstances information can be shared
and with whom. Very conservative interpretations of confidentiality

[p. <i>496</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00516&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The case plan should articulate who is involved in the service
delivery process (see Chapters 78 through 83, this volume), and
information from all systems (social service, education, mental
health, medical, law enforcement, etc.) should be gathered and
used in the case planning process. A very successful model of
securing the input and perspective of all service providers and for
improving coordination is to hold periodic case planning meetings
to which all interested parties are invited and encouraged to
attend.


? <i>The Case Planning Meeting</i>


The meeting should be held at a time and place of greatest
convenience to the family and key service providers. To this
meeting, the family should be invited, along with all social service
providers, therapists and counselors, foster parents or residential
service providers, teachers for all the children, and any other
formal or informal service providers. With all present, the worker
can lead a frank discussion of the issues and what actions each
person should take to implement the plan for safety and long-term
success for the family or child or both. Participants should
be encouraged to speak honestly with the client family while
being respectful and ensuring that positives are also noted with
any areas of concern. Such meetings must be followed up by the
worker with personal contacts to test progress and to determine
successes to celebrate with the family, risks that signal danger for
the child or the need for revisions in the case plan, or both. Major
changes in direction should be accompanied by a reconvening of
the case planning team and a revised plan.


In between such meetings and when a meeting is not feasible,
the caseworker must take other steps to ensure coordination. This
can take the form of personal contact between the caseworker
and each professional or layperson playing a planned role in the
service delivery plan. Few services can be initiated and then
ignored. Most plans require consistent monitoring and adjustment

Responding to escalating demand and dwindling resources,
in 1992 the Annie E. Casey Foundation began
an initiative called "Family to Family" to improve outcomes
for children and families served by the child welfare
system. More than a foster care program, Family to Family
provides integrated child welfare services that are family focused,
child centered, and neighborhood based. While ensuring the
safety of children, it focuses our work on the strengths of whole
families and communities.


The following are the philosophies of Family to Family:

process. All families have strengths you can build on.

Applying the previously discussed practices reduces the number
of children coming into care, achieves permanency earlier, provides
a more stable pool of foster families, and decreases worker
turnover. Whether your agency has formally adopted this model
or not, you and the members of your team will benefit if you

Foster and kinship caregivers are two of the most important
resources in the child welfare system repository for caring
for children. Individuals and families that provide foster
and kinship care are essentially contributing the same services to
child welfare agencies, but child welfare agencies do not provide
the same resources to kinship and foster families. Kinship care
homes receive less money and fewer services, and monitoring of
the homes is less frequent. Child welfare programs need to
provide services that are more equitable across both types of
out-of-home care. Often, child welfare workers believe that
kinship care families have fewer needs, but this is not supported
by research. The needs of foster and kinship providers may be
different, but the needs of the children in care are often similar.


In this chapter, I divide support and intervention for foster
and kinship families into four categories of needs: financial,
services, social support, and educational. When appropriate, a
distinction is made between foster and kinship families and the
different needs that each possess.

[p. <i>502</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00522&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Support and Intervention Needs</i>


<i>
<b>Financial</b>
</i>


Foster and kinship families may receive funding from different
sources. Foster families are required to be licensed and therefore
receive funding through foster care funding streams. Kinship
families may or may not be licensed. If they are not licensed, they
receive funding through the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.


Per diem rates vary from state to state for foster care children.
Foster and kinship families receiving foster care payments are
allocated a designated amount per child. Families may receive
more money per child if the child has special needs (e.g., HIV
positive status). Kinship families that are not eligible for foster
care payments may receive welfare benefits for the child. In
addition, if the kinship caregiver is caring for a brother or sister
or cousin in the same family, the caregiver may receive an
incremental increase (not the full payment that they would
receive in foster care) in her or his welfare payment based on the
standard welfare increases.


<i>
<b>Clothing</b>
</i>


Foster and kinship caregivers need assistance in providing
clothes for children, the cost of which cannot be covered totally
with the per diem received by the families. Special occasions, such
as proms or sporting activities, may require extra clothes. It is
important that the child welfare worker assist the family in
locating additional clothing resources.


<i>
<b>Transportation</b>

As in any family, children require transportation to and from
sporting activities, school events, doctors' offices, and so on, and
sometimes this requires the worker to locate transportation or
assist in the transport of children. Unlike other children, foster
and kinship children may have additional transportation needs
that sometimes put strain on the family. Many children are in
therapy or need to have visits with parents and siblings. To reduce
stress on the foster and kinship families, workers should assist
families in identifying transportation resources.

<i>
<b>Services</b>
</i>


Foster and kinship families require equal but in some circumstances
different services. Compared to foster families, kinship
families are poorer, usually older, single parent, and less educated.
In assessing needs in kinship families, the worker has to examine
the following triad: caregiver, parent, and child. Children placed
in foster and kinship families often require the same services
because the reasons for entering into care are comparable.


<i>
<b>Case Management</b>
</i>


After establishing a collaborative intervention plan with the
family, the child welfare worker will have to manage and oversee
the progress in meeting the objectives and goals of the permanency
treatment plan. Kinship families, even more than foster
families, may demand the worker to more actively act as an
advocate and broker of services. Other kinship families may find
that any intervention is intrusive because they view the child
placed in their home as "their kin" and may believe they know
what is best for the child. It is a balancing act that the worker
needs to negotiate with the family, with the child's needs in mind.


The child welfare worker should also help the foster and
kinship families negotiate the court system. Often, families and
children are required to be present in court. It is helpful for the
worker to inform the foster and kinship family about the court
process and what to expect (e.g., delays).


<i>
<b>Mental Health</b>
</i>


Foster and kinship children come into care for similar reasons
and need mental health services at similar rates. On the basis of
a thorough assessment, the worker identifies what mental health
resources are most appropriate for the child and assists the foster
or kinship family in obtaining the service. In addition, in the case
of kinship families, the caregiver may need mental health services.
Often, the caregiver may be struggling with the reality of his or
her child's drug addiction or status of being HIV positive.


<i>
<b>Medical Care</b>
</i>


Many children enter care due to neglect, and as a result they
often have not received routine medical care (see Chapter 26, this

[p. <i>504</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00524&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Dental Care</b>
</i>


The caregiver sometimes neglects dental care. Children require
routine dental checkups (see Chapter 60, this volume).
Because children in foster and kinship care are insured by Medicaid,
families may need assistance in identifying a dentist who
accepts this type of insurance. A doctor who accepts Medicaid is
frequently not the family's current dental care provider and may
be located further away. The worker needs to keep this in mind
when negotiating with families to provide this care.


<i>
<b>Social Support</b>
</i>


Social support interventions provide for many of the needs
that foster and kinship families present. The worker is charged
with helping families assess challenges in their social network and
to make the appropriate connections in their communities to
address them.


<i>
<b>Formal Social Support</b>
</i>


The worker may be one of the most important formal social
supports on which the foster or kinship family must rely. Support
that the child welfare worker provides to families is fundamental.


Foster and kinship families may be very involved in their
community support systems (e.g., family support services,
churches, schools, and community centers); however, if they are
not, or if a child presents a need not met by a current support
system, the worker can encourage families to become connected
with formal support systems. Social support can reduce stress,
address concrete and emotional needs, and provide information
to families.

[p. <i>505</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00525&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another form of formal social support that the worker may
aid in providing is respite care. Respite care may be the deciding
factor for families when considering taking a special needs child.
It provides the needed break from what is often a very stressful
situation.


<i>
<b>Informal Social Support</b>
</i>


Informal social supports provide emotional and tangible support
to foster and kinship families. It is important for the worker
to encourage families to build informal social support systems
such as family, friends, and coworkers. Particularly in kinship
families, informal social supports are significant. Considering
that the majority of children in kinship care are from families of
color and that culturally these families rely on extended family
for support, the worker should support and acknowledge this as
a valuable resource in kinship homes. For example, a 70-year-old
grandmother may need to depend on an aunt or uncle to provide
some of the care for her grandchildren.


<i>
<b>Educational Needs</b>
</i>


Educational planning for children is a key service that foster
and kinship families require. Many children in care are developmentally
delayed and require special education. The system is
overwhelming at times and one that families often want aid in
negotiating. The worker may need to advocate for the child to
get the needed resources to meet his or her educational needs.


<i>
<b>Individual Educational Plan</b>
</i>


This is a formal process of assessment of the child's educational
needs. The worker and the caregiver may be required to
attend the meeting. The family may need assistance to understand
the individual educational plan process and what they can demand
from the educational institution.


<i>
<b>Special Services</b>
</i>


Some children will need to be placed in a special education
classroom or need speech or hearing classes. The worker may
need to help families demand assistance in understanding and
accessing these services.

[p. <i>506</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00526&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Behavioral problems of the child may also require special
services and cause additional stress on the foster and kinship
families. It is important that the worker facilitates a program that
will help reduce the child's behavior (e.g., behavior modification
program).


<i>
<b>Training</b>
</i>


Although in many states training is mandated for foster and
kinship caregivers, the worker may want to identify areas of
training needs for the families and try to find resources that meet
these needs. Videos and books can often serve as part of mandated
training (e.g., how to manage a particular situation). It is very
supportive if the worker can aid in obtaining training resources,
thus contributing to the overall well-being and functioning of the
family.

In the initial phase of the investigation or assessment of
families, practitioners have to be aware of all potential resources
available to assist families. Members of the clergy or
those in spiritual leadership are often overlooked as viable supports
to families. Knowing and discussing a family's religious or
spiritual context or both may assist practitioners in understanding
the attitudes, values, and the explicit and implicit messages that
may inform a family's belief system with regard to physical
punishment as a method of discipline.


Practitioners, spiritual leaders, and the client must address
issues of confidentiality. If the client has identified their pastor,
minister, rabbi, or priest as someone to whom information can
be released, then by all means that person should be used as a
resource. In the absence of formal consent, the child protective
service law does allow relevant parties to meet as a multidisciplinary
team during the investigation. Spiritual leaders can be
invited to attend the multidisciplinary team in support of their
parishioner; without a formal team, however, the practitioner
needs written consent from the child's parent or guardian. Religious
leaders are also bound by laws of confidentiality and cannot

[p. <i>508</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00528&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many clients do not disclose the origins of their feelings
regarding disciplining their children with corporal punishment.
These feelings are often based on a strong religious value base or
their belief that the government does not have the right to tell
them how to discipline their children. Other clients may not
disclose their religious affiliation because they do not want to be
viewed negatively by their spiritual leaders or community.


Understanding a family's religious faith can assist the practitioner
in assessing whether there is spiritual sanction for the use
of corporal punishment to change behavior in children. Many
clients use their religious or spiritual values as a rationale or basis
for using physical discipline to punish their children. The belief
for some that "sparing the rod spoils the child" is often used to
justify the physical abuse of children. In the traditional Christian
context, some parents may view their child's behavior as "demonic"
or "satanic"--that is, the child is "full of the devil," which
allows the parent to literally attempt to "beat the hell" out of the
youngster. These families rarely view their child's behavior as a
manifestation of family dysfunction.


Many spiritual and religious belief systems view confession,
repentance, and forgiveness as essential to their followers' healing
and recovery. Confession to their "God" and forgiveness from
their God should lead to repentance for the behavior of harming
their child. Hurting someone in most spiritual contexts is considered
a "sin" for which one needs forgiveness. Forgiveness allows
for reconciliation with self, individuals wronged, and community.
Most religious individuals engage in some form of prayer, meditation,
or spiritual ritual. For example, Christians believe that the
"Holy Ghost" or "Holy Spirit" of God leads, guides, and directs
them in decision making. This includes whether it is problematic
to hit their child.


The practitioner's ability to connect with the family and
understand their spiritual or religious frame of reference or both
is important in terms of the family's disclosure. How the practitioner
handles the family's expression of religious influence will

[p. <i>509</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00529&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There are a variety of spiritual and religious institutions in
communities--Protestants, Catholics, members of the Jewish and
Islamic faiths, and Black Muslims. Legitimate spiritual leadership
in any of these denominations must meet a minimal standard to
be recognized by the community of faith to which they belong.
Ordination or some formal ritual is usually a part of the process
that allows for legitimate leadership. Legitimate clergy are usually
involved in congregations and do not stand alone, do not rule or
govern in isolation, and will not hesitate to send a practitioner
information about the denomination or the particular church.
The practitioner has to risk asking questions and informing the
clergyperson that he or she is in the midst of an investigation in
which he or she could use the clergyperson's expertise. A good
way to ascertain whether a particular church or faith community
will be helpful to the therapeutic process with dysfunctional
families is to ask whether the church has a counseling ministry or
if the church uses counseling ministries in the community. The
response will give the practitioner an idea about the importance
of counseling to that church.


Workers need to cultivate relationships with religious leaders
in as many denominations and beliefs systems as possible so they
can use these leaders as consultants when they need specific
information about a particular denomination and how it functions.
Many religious persons do not believe that physical punishment
is inconsistent with appropriate parenting. Rather, they
believe that God's authority supersedes governmental authority
and allows them to use corporal punishment. Alternatives to the
use of corporal punishment could involve assisting parents in
identifying nonphysical ways to punish inappropriate behavior
and rewarding appropriate behavior. For example, withholding
privileges and use of time-outs are constructive forms of noncorporal
punishment.


Pastors and leaders of religious institutions are very diverse.
There is no standard response or approach that can be identified
and used in assessing and interacting with those in the religious
community. Practitioners must use their professional skills to

[p. <i>510</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00530&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Practitioners must be willing to risk themselves by entering
into meaningful relationships with both clients and clergy. Although
workers cannot train clergy on the finer points of the child
protective service laws, practitioners can educate clergy on what
constitutes abuse of children. Efforts with clergy must be viewed
as a partnership in which clergy and laity come together on behalf
of the family.
