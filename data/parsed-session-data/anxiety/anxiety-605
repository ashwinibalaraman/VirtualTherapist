The world is big and frightening. It capriciously buffets even the
seasoned veteran in the art of living, whimsically cradling his
dreams one moment, only to dash all his hopes the next. Regardless
of how intensive has been the preparation, or how gentle has
been the entry, that first step into the world beyond the protecting
palisades of the family circle is sobering and tarnishing. This
process, by design lonely, maturing, and cleaving, is, however, absolutely
necessary for the purpose of rending those nuturing bonds
that are essential for coaxing life and growth into the human infant,
but that are also deadeningly detrimental to the child's continued
maturation into a self-sustaining adult.


Nature determined that approximately nine months of uterine
nurturing was sufficient to prepare the human offspring for the
traumatic thrust into the world within the family; and society,
just as omnisciently, decreed that approximately six years of familial
nurturing was adequate to ready the child for its second forcible
thrust--the one into the fierce competition of the world without.
School, the institutionalization of this second thrust, is
specifically tailored to ensure that the young, on this first unaccompanied
sortie into open society, will experience and internalize
those facts, beliefs, and values that will allow society to perpetuate
itself. The fittest survive. But the fittest in what? Strength? Intelligence?
Endurance? Adaptability? Wealth? Beauty? Unfortunately
the need varies with the individual circumstances and the
particular moment in time, making it impossible to know in advance
exactly with what to equip the emerging fledgling.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Christine approached her initial encounter with the world without
as she did every new experience, full of eagerness and enthusiasm.
She felt no apprehension, no fear, these came later; now she
was all thrilling anticipation. Two burning reasons whetted her
desire for wanting to start to school: writing and painting. She
had always intensely hated her name, <i>Christine</i>--it hissed and
whined nasally in her ear. <i>Anne</i> and <i>Elen</i> were soft, breathy
sounds that lulled one's thoughts; but her own name grated unpleasantly,
always sounding like a criticism, never a caress. She
had never seen her name written, but she had an idea that it
would strike the eye more favorably than it struck the ear. The
very first thing she wanted to do on the very first day at school was
learn to write her name.


All things beautiful intrigued her, and she had discovered that
one learned to make beautiful things in school. Anne had learned
how to make pretty pictures in school, and she even had a box of
precious crayons that she sternly forbade Christine to touch, with
which she colored them. She fashioned paper dolls out of cardboard
for Elen, and dressed them in lovely paper clothes decorated
with those carefully shepherded crayons. Christine also
longed desperately for paper dolls, and she knew that school was
her only hope of getting them.


The third reason why she needed school was unknown to her;
she felt it only as a deep urge, a painful gnawing, an unassuageable
hunger. She needed her own experience, to be shared with no one;
something that was particularly and uniquely hers, that she could
reveal and share if she so chose, but that she could hoard and
conceal if the need demanded. School often provides this essential
service, it being, in fact, one of its major premises; but for
Christine, already hypersensitive and rubbed raw from too much
hurt and too little protection from harmful criticism, its failure
was miserable, swift, and complete.


School offered only one fare, served in an identical manner to
all, with little attempt at individualization to make it more palatable
for finicky appetites. Christine had known from her earliest
memory that she fell short of reaching some pretty important
standards maintained by her family, but she had grown to believe
that she could set all that straight by going to school, where one
learned how to do things right. She had never been in a school before,

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the magic day dawned, Christine, never one to sleep
late, was awake and impatient to be gone long before the necessary
time. Acie dressed her while Zueline cared for the babies and
made breakfast. Zueline also prepared the child's school lunch: a
boiled egg, a biscuit, and a precious piece of fried ham. On most
days the lunch would consist of biscuits and fatback; but today,
this all-important first day, the mother wanted her child to have a
grand lunch. Wrapping the warm, savory food in newspaper and
tying it with a white grocery string, she handed it to the eager little
girl with these stern instructions:


"Now, Christine, you be good! Don't drop your lunch, and
don't get your clothes dirty. And now, you listen to Mother, you
mind the teacher and do everything she says. Ya' hear? Do you
hear me, Christine?" She gently shook the child, who was so obviously
eager to be off.


"Yes, Mother. Bye, Mother," hastily replied the totally uncomprehending
Christine. She hugged her lunch tightly, too
tightly, and ran for the door.


Acie, watching the scene with amused eyes, smiled at his frustrated
wife, hugging her briefly as he followed his impatient
daughter out into the faint, misty light. "Don't worry, Mother,
she'll be all right. This will be the making of her. The teacher will
straighten her out."


Zueline worriedly shook her head, feeling that she should have
been able to give the child better instructions, and she had even
let her go without hugging and kissing her good-bye. Looking out
at her husband and child crossing the packed red clay yard in the
moist, warm dawn, her heart was torn between protective love,
which longed to recall the dancing child for a tender kiss, and maternal

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Christine, you keep your socks pulled up, and don't give the
teacher any trouble. The teacher is always right!"


Christine, her socks already beginning their inevitable descent
down the thin white legs, marred here and there by the old signs
of winter boils and the scrapes and scratches of boisterous play,
chattered happily to her father as they moved down the dew-wet
path.


"I'm gonna learn to write my name today!" she announced as
she ran a small circle around him.


Acie, trying to keep the child out of the tall, dripping grass at
the sides of the path, scolded, "Top, stay on the path. Your shoes
and socks are soaking." It did not occur to him to warn his daughter
that all her expectations might not be met on the very first
day, but it is also questionable whether the exuberant child would
even have heard him. She had early earned the name of "headstrong,"
which merely meant that she accepted no one's advice or
warning on any subject--she had to travel every path herself, as if
it had never been traveled before. It was a trait that was to cause
her much trouble all of her life.


However, on this beautiful morning, all was right with her
world. The red-gold sun, just topping the wet, shadowy trees,
caught and brilliantly shattered each crystal drop on each luscious
green blade. The pasture was a velvet mound strewn with a king's
ransom of glittering jewels, and the child, herself an imp of nature,
was prevented from gathering them only by the fast hold of
her practical, earthbound father. The spreading light, striking the
towering trees at the spring, revealed for the close observer the
first bronze hint of autumn. A thready puff of mist still blanketed
the overhung spring bower, outlining all of the intricate spider
lace in tiny glowing seed pearls.


Christine, vacillating between her strong admiration for all
beauty and her equally strong rejection of any beauty that she
could not possess, alternately destroyed some of the shining creations
with one swipe of her commandeered stick, and meticulously
avoided damaging others. Clumsily jumping the stones fording
the creek and wetting miraculously only the toe of one shoe, she

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Anne, Anne, are you ready? Are you ready to go?" Pushing
upon the never-locked door to the kitchen, she burst into the
room, announcing, "I'm going to school. Today, I'm going to
school. I'm going to learn to write my name!"


Mama, busy with pots at the big black iron cookstove, turned
and looked briefly at her breathless grandchild, "Goodness, Christine,
you'll wake the dead! What are you doing up so early?"


Acie, coming in the door, took off his old sweat-stained summer
straw hat and hung it on one of several nails tacked for that very
purpose along the wall. "Miz Hastin', she's been up since before
daylight. Sister wanted me to bring her as I come to work so's she
wouldn't have to cross the pasture alone while the cows are near
the lot."


"Wouldn't hurt her, Acie. Sister has always been afraid of cows.
She didn't take after me. My papa used to say that all animals
loved me. You've just got to let them know who's boss, that's all."
And Mama, barely five feet tall, drew herself up to her full rotund
height. In spite of her diminutive size, she was an impressive
figure, carrying her weight as a badge of pride in her womanhood
--as the mother of eleven live-born children, ten of whom were
still living. A successful woman was one who bore children, ran a
decent, moral home, kept a firm hand on daughters and a watchful
though indulgent eye on sons, and grew comfortably old in the
full knowledge of her lasting place of honor, authority, and affection
in the hearts of her ever-expanding family of in-laws and
grandchildren. And Mama--Anne Surilla Hastings, née Smith--
was successful. She also had very definite ideas concerning those
traits in girls that must be developed early to insure their success
in finding suitable husbands and fulfilling their roles as women.
Of prime importance was a quiet, mannerly, ladylike demeanor in
the presence of adults and especially in the presence of men.


Mama was considerably worried about Christine. This strange,
stubborn grandchild frustrated her, never seeming to respond to
any of her heretofore never-failing methods of whipping into
shape those undesirable qualities in young females, or at least
of driving them underground until the girls were successfully
launched. Mama's way was never gentle and cajoling, and her concern

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On this day, separated by one whole generation, they faced each
other in the warm, good-smelling kitchen, and there was no common
ground on which they could meet. The child, silently begging
for acceptance, looked longingly up at the frowning woman;
the frustrated matriarch, feeling a personal defeat in having to
send this raw, unacceptable family representative out into the
world, stared mutely down at the child. Feeling her thwarted concern
turn to helpless anger at the injustice of it all, Mama brusquely
directed,


"Sit over there behind the stove on that stool and dry out. You
don't want the teacher to see you wet." She turned to Acie,
"Now, you just go on and don't worry any, the girls will take care
of the young'un."


As Christine silently turned to her seat of banishment behind
the stove, she threw her grandmother a secret look of unalloyed
hate. Quickly masking her burning blue gaze, Christine thought
spitefully, "She's mean and old and ugly and wrinkled and I hate
her, I hate her, I hate her!"


Soon the kitchen was filled with bustling activity. Mama had
four children who went to school, but only three were starting
today. The fourth, twelve-year-old Ernest, was already out in the
fields with the men. Most of the farm boys were several weeks late
starting school each year, since their free labor was needed to help
harvest the late crops. The three girls clattered down the bare
stairs and ran head on into Mama's instructive scolding,


"Girls, girls, you'll wake the dead with all that noise. I'm glad
the men are all out of the house and can't hear you. They'd be
shocked!-Elise, the button is unfastened at the back of your dress;
Myrtle, straighten up your belt, and you're about to lose a hairpin.

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The three girls dutifully did as they were told, murmuring the
appropriate answers. Anne solemnly declared, crossing her heart as
proof, that her cheeks were unsullied, then she soulfully rolled her
big blue eyes and winked her untruthfulness at Christine behind
the stove. She was ten years old and endowed with a sweet, angelic
face that belied the teasing, impish nature inherited from her
father. Her face, most often lighted by a bright, innocent smile,
could, however, quickly turn to stubborn pouting when she was
crossed; and she had early learned when to use each ploy to her
best advantage. Her loyalty and generosity knew no limits, and
though she often led Christine into trouble and caused her much
resultant misery, she loved her little niece and gave her much
needed companionship and acceptance.


The other two girls, Myrtle and Elise, fourteen and seventeen,
respectively, though constant companions, were a study in contrasts.
Myrtle was a Smith, taking after Mama's side of the family.
She was a gentle, sweet-natured girl with brown eyes and long
brown hair worn in a braided wreath around her graceful head.
She had an incredibly tiny waist and beautiful rounded arms with
lovely dimpled elbows. She strove never to hurt a single creature,
and though destined not to raise her own children beyond infancy,
her loving manner caused her nieces and nephews to each
feel that she loved them best of all. Elise, a true Hastings, had
flashing dark eyes and glossy black curly hair worn close to her
head. Born a rounded, chubby child, she, more than the others,
resembled her mother in size and temperament. She was brusque,
straightforward, and hearty in manner and emotion, often throwing
back her head and bursting forth into deep-throated, ringing
laughter, faintly reminiscent of her father's loud guffaws. Serious
and industrious, without an envious or malicious bone in her
body, she marched through life giving abundantly of her endless
love and her fierce loyalty to those who were strong enough to
bear her blunt honesty.


The three Hastings girls on the first day of school in the fall of
1933 were dressed in printed cotton shirtwaist dresses that Elise
had made on Mamie Lee's sewing machine, brown tie-up oxford

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Christine, feeling terribly alone and isolated, watched the warm
flurry of action, desperately wishing that her dress matched theirs.
She had never had a dress like that with a belt--hers were always
loose shifts--and she longed for turn-down anklets instead of her
awful knee socks, which forever sagged and bunched around her
ankles. She began to feel ugly, and her fears were confirmed when
her Aunt Myrtle led her from behind the stove and, taking her
own comb from the pocket of her dress, tried to smooth the
flighty hair. As a last-ditch effort to improve the ornery strands,
she firmly tucked them behind the child's ears, noting in her
calm, low voice,


"I wish Sister hadn't let Acie cut Top's hair so short. There's
just nothing you can do with it now."


Mama, still feeling the fringes of her puzzled anger over this little
urchin born into her family, frowned,


"Wet it, Myrt, see if that will help. You take her to her teacher
today, and go back for her this afternoon. Keep her as clean as
you can on the way to school. Tell the teacher who she is; she
might not know since her name is not Hastings. And let the
teacher know that you are responsible for her." Mama, in her own
way, was trying to give the child every advantage, knowing that
gentle, well-liked Myrtle would provide the best care for her. Frivolous
Anne would have deserted her immediately, and no-nonsense
Elise would have given firm instructions once and then
washed her hands of the whole affair if she had not been obeyed.


As they were leaving the house, Christine noted another serious
deficiency in her preparation for school. Each of her three aunts
carried a small bag in which she stored her lunch, pencils, extra
handkerchief, and other items necessary to a young lady at school
all day. The bags were made of heavy denim and had been cut
and sewn by Elise. The child wished that she had one and wondered
if she would get one at school. Ironically, it was on this

"The Attic Child"
by Chris Sizemore, 1975
JIM TINGSTRUM
</div>

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the four girls, spanning the entire range of Edgefield
County's educational offering, started out on their long walk to
meet the school bus, the sun was just clearing the tallest trees on
what promised to be a cloudless, sultry Carolina day. This early,
however, the air still held the faint, misty chill of the night, causing
the girls to hurry through the shadows under the trees and out
into the warm sun. They were thinly clad and prevented from
suffering cold only by the exertions of their walk, which took
them up the rutted, washed lane, past the turkey pens, the barns
and cattle lots, and the granary to Ellis and Mamie Lee's house
on the hill. As they walked by the quiet house, Christine thought
of all the things she would have to tell Elen when she returned in
the afternoon. She would show her how to write <i>Christine,</i> and
she would make her some paper dolls. Just thinking about it excited
the child and, forgetting her shortcomings, she began to
dance and skip down the dusty lane, bringing from Elise a stern
reprimand,


"Teeny, stop that playing! You are old enough to go to school
now, and that's old enough to walk like a lady. Look how dusty
your shoes are!"


Myrtle gently answered her sister. "Honey, she can't learn it all
in one day. I'll clean her up in the basement when we get to
school."


Elise tossed her black curls and, straightening her own thoroughly
neat dress, tartly observed, "Well, I wouldn't want your
job."


The lane, level and straight with a narrow grassy strip separating
the worn, hard-packed wheel ruts, ran between two gleaming
white cotton fields. The long, curved rows, shaped to fit the rolling
slope of the land, bore stiff, dry stalks heavy with puffy white
fiber ready for picking. Each exploded boll had to be picked by
hand, and it took the men and boys several weeks of backbreaking
labor to harvest the fields. Some women picked cotton, but
Mama, no matter how straitened the family affairs, would not

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Red Hill road dead-ended into the Modoc road, one of the
most important and traveled roads in the county, and it was here
that the girls met the bus, which could be heard, grinding and
gearing its stops, long before it topped the hill and rumbled to a
halt in a cloud of yellow dust. It was typical of that American institution--the
school bus--big and squat with <i>Edgefield County
Schools</i> painted in bold black on its bulging muddy orange sides.
As the brakes screamed in protest, the rubber-edged double doors
grated open, and Myrtle half lifted, half pushed the suddenly immobile
Christine up the two steep steps and into the unique
transit environment of the school bus.


The three older girls, who had carefully smoothed their hair
and critically checked their clothes before sedately mounting the
steps, were immediately loudly and laughingly hailed by last year's
acquaintances, who squeezed over to make room for the new arrivals.
It resembled a reunion of old friends who had been separated
for years instead of just the short summer vacation. The bus,
already more than half full, bore mostly girls, and this would be
the case for several weeks, when the male riders would begin to
pick up as the crop harvesting leveled off.


The driver grated his gears, and the bus lurched drunkenly and
shuddered loosely before lumbering down the hill. The new riders,
still unseated, squealed in mock fright and fell awkwardly over
laughing companions into waiting places saved especially for
them. The comments ran thus:

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I <i>love</i> that dress! Where <i>did</i> you get that material?"


"Oh, this ole thing! Now, aren't you so sweet to say that. I just
<i>love</i> yours!"


"This old rag! I just didn't have <i>anything</i> to wear."


"What <i>have</i> you been doing all summer?"


"Nothing, just <i>nothing!</i> I haven't been anywhere but to town."


"I haven't seen a soul, either."


"If wonder if we have any new teachers?"


"I hope we have some good-looking <i>men</i> teachers."


"Just any ole kind of men teachers would help!"


"You've cut your hair. I just <i>love</i> it!"


"Aren't you sweet, but it's too curly to fall right. I <i>hate</i> it!"


"Mine is just a mess. I can't do a thing with it!"


And on and on ...


The school bus had its own definite hierarchy, with some seats
being more important than others, such as those at the very front
and those at the very back, but the seating was mostly according
to age. An adult-sized wooden bench ran down each side of the
wide vehicle, and the larger, older riders sat with their backs to
the strange slide-down windows, which were forever stuck, either
up or down. Through the middle of the bus ran two low backless
benches for the little kids. These benches, slanted up under the
knees, threw the children back to back and prevented them from
sliding off onto the floor. Since there was nothing for anybody to
hold onto, the riders swayed and bumped laughingly into each
other's shoulders, as the old bus jerked and bounced over the rutted,
washboard roads.


It all seemed like great fun to Christine as she sat crammed between
two other children, leaning heavily against the back of an
unseen child behind her. She swayed from side to side, clutching
her lunch on her elevated knees and wondering how far her feet
were from the floor. Her one fear was that she would not be able
to get out of the bus and would be left alone all day. Looking
around for her aunts, she saw Myrtle and Elise talking animatedly
to strange people, and Anne was way at the back of the center
bench, busily whispering secrets into the delighted ear of another
stranger. Christine felt lost and alone.


The bus soon smoothed out as it struck the paved streets of
Edgefield, only to bump jerkily again as it wheeled onto the

"Christine, this way." And Myrtle took her hand and led her
through the crowd.


"Aunt Myrt," the child pleaded, not knowing for what she was
asking; and her aunt, pushed for time and busily recognizing old
friends, was unaware of the desperate note in the trembling voice.


As the crowd thinned, Christine looked up and saw the biggest
building she had ever seen, bigger even than the Court House.
Edgefield High School was a three-story, red-brick building that
housed all eleven grades. A concrete sidewalk ran the entire length
of the building, and where it joined the wide sweep of walk leading
up to the broad entrance steps stood a long, narrow concrete
fountain holding four water spigots turned up for drinking. Inside
the front entrance was a wide foyer sporting a bulletin board and
two tables and leading into the main hall, which ran the length of
the building. At each end of the hall was a stair leading up to the
top story and down to the bottom level--the basement. The
floors, built of long narrow boards, smooth and dark from years of
use and oiling, were maintained by sprinkling them with an oily
compound to keep down the dust. The compound, resembling
dark-brown damp sawdust, was periodically removed and renewed;
and its pungent smell, along with the acrid dust of chalk, daily assaulted
the breathing apparatus of students and created the
"schoolhouse smell," an odor peculiar to school buildings.


Myrtle and Christine entered the building through an end
door and descended the half stair to the basement, where the first-grade
rooms were located. The furnace room and the rest rooms
were also to be found on this level. In fact, the practice of placing
rest rooms in school basements was so prevalent that a student, on

The hall and the rooms were crowded with people, little people
and adults, going in and out, or just standing. Several children
were crying and clinging to embarrassed mothers, who, no matter
what their words of reproof, proved, to the close observer, to be
clinging just as tightly to their frightened offspring. Myrtle took
Christine into the girls' rest room, sponged her face with her
dampened handkerchief, recombed her fly-away hair, and pulled
up her socks, admonishing all the while in her sweet, calm voice,


"Now, sit still, Top, and don't squirm in your seat. Do exactly
what the teacher says. And I will come and pick you up after
school."


She pulled the reluctant child along the dim, cool hall and into
a classroom. It was filled with rows of tiny school desks constructed
of polished boards, fastened to black iron frames, which
were nailed to the floor. The writing board of each desk, equipped
with an inkwell, a pencil tray, and a shelf for supplies, was fastened
to the backrest of the desk directly in front. Many of the
desks already contained small, serious-faced first-graders; and in a
ragged row along the wall stood several self-conscious mothers.


Myrtle pushed the frightened, wide-eyed child up to the
teacher's desk and spoke respectfully to the plump, serious woman
seated on a straight wooden chair,


"Miss Waldrop, I am Myrtle Hastings from out at the Butler
place, and this is my niece, Christine Costner. She is my sister's
girl. She is starting to school today."


Eiron Waldrop, a veteran teacher of thirty years, put her hand
up to the bunned hair at the nape of her neck and unsmilingly observed
the trembling child. She knew her work well, and she
knew what was expected of her, being well aware that each child
had been warned about "the teacher" and what the teacher would
do with naughty children. She was not married. Teaching was
considered a full-time job, and women teachers who married were
not allowed to continue teaching, on the premise that their interests
would be divided and that they could not devote their full
time to their work. Perhaps there was also the thought that carnal
knowledge was not proper for women who taught innocent children.
Parents expected teachers to mold their sons and daughters

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, yes, Myrtle," she replied cordially, "I remember you, and
I know your family. Leave Christine with me. Pick her up here
after school until she learns her bus." Rising from her chair, she
put her firm hand on the child's shoulder and strongly urged her
away from Myrtle.


"Come, Christine. I will show you your place," she instructed
with calm, unsmiling authority.


Christine felt her aunt loosen her grasp, and she felt her own
tight hold on the familiar hand break apart under the unrelenting
pressure of the strange, cool fingers on her shoulder.


"Aunt Myrt ...," she gasped as big tears began to form in
her frightened eyes.


"Now, Christine, you go with the teacher, and do everything she
tells you. Be a good girl," Myrtle gently directed the child. Only
fourteen herself, the older girl could not know the terror of being
abandoned in the bowels of this huge, dark building, surrounded
only by strangers and strange things. Since she herself had started
school in a rural one-room building where the teacher was a family
friend and where several of her older brothers and sisters were
also students, Myrtle had no conception of the child's terror. And
anyway, she had to get to her own class. Everybody had to go to
school.


"Just run along, Myrtle, Christine will be fine," Miss Waldrop
declared, ending what her long experience had taught her could
become a difficult situation if allowed to prolong.


"I'll come for you when school's out, Top. Stay here and don't
get lost." And, completely putting the child out of her mind, Myrtle
hurried off to begin her own new school year, confident that
her little charge was in good hands and that she was successfully
launched on her school career.


Miss Waldrop, her generous figure clad in a dark blue crepe
shirtwaist with long sleeves, led the no longer resisting Christine
to a little desk near the back of the room, informing her,

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"This is your seat. This is where you will sit."


And that's exactly what she did. For many hours, even days, she
just sat. There were no magic crayons, no pictures to paint, no
name to be written--just sitting.


Soon a bell rang. A harsh, grating clang, it assaulted the ear
with shock even when it was expected, but to the unprepared it
was truly an electrifying experience. The small children, all huddled
in their strange new seats, started violently at this unpleasant
attack, and were saved from reaction only by the teacher's behavior.
As soon as the bell ceased, Miss Waldrop rose from her chair,
and keeping the large light-oak desk between her and her pupils,
she smiled faintly, folded her white, well-manicured hands at her
ample waist, and addressed her new charges,


"Children, I am Miss Waldrop, your teacher. We are going to
learn many things this year. First, I want you to learn where you
are to sit. You must always sit in your own seat. If you want to say
something, please, raise your hand and I will call your name. You
may not speak out without permission, and you may not leave
your seat unless you are told to do so. Now, children, listen carefully,
I am going to tell you to do something. Listen carefully. Everybody,
get up and put your lunch boxes and bags on the table at
the back of the room. Everybody now. Get up and put your
lunches on the back table."


The children, hesitantly at first, then following the lead of the
bolder, more mature ones, quickly began to carry their lunch containers
and put them on the long, low table. Christine, too busy
looking and feeling, did not even hear the command. She rose
only because everybody else did, and she carried her lunch simply
because she had never yet turned it loose. She stood by the table,
hesitant and alone, until the teacher instructed,


"Put your lunch on the table, Christine, and come back to your
seat."


The confused, lost child did as she was bidden, seeming only to
hear commands when they were directed solely to her, when she
heard her name called.


Miss Waldrop continued, "We are glad to have so many
mothers come to school today. They are going to leave now, but
they will be back to pick you up when school is out."


As the mothers, looking fondly at their little ones and waving

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The morning was interminably long. The teacher asked questions
and called children up to her desk. She often looked out at
her restless students and warned,


"Do not talk. In school, one does not talk."


Christine daydreamed, thought of Elen, and once even fell
asleep with her head resting on the hard desk. She wondered when
she would learn to write her name, and she wanted to ask the
teacher, but Miss Waldrop was always so busy. Once her empty
stomach, having had no attention since early morning, loudly
protested this long-neglected state, and several children looked
wonderingly at her; one tousled-haired little boy even laughed.
Miss Waldrop looked sternly in their direction and placed her
finger across her pale lips. Christine was horribly embarrassed. She
had been warned often about making body noises, and even
though this was not one over which she had any control, she was
not sure everybody knew that. She tried holding her breath when
she felt another explosion building up, but the watery gurgle
seemed even louder than before. This time several children giggled,
and she felt that everybody was looking at her. Miss Waldrop
frowned severely and shook her head at them. Finally, when
Christine thought she could stand her condition no longer, the
teacher stood up and announced,


"It's recess time, children. I am going to give out your lunches.
Then we will go outside for recess. Stay in your seats while I give
out the lunches. We will march outside." And she went to the
table at the back of the room and began to pass out the lunch
boxes.


Christine had never seen such an array of beautiful boxes. They
were all colors, some even had pictures painted on them, and they
were all shapes--square, flat, shaped like mailboxes, and one was
even round. Most were fitted with little carrying handles, but
some had no handles and were carried clutched in the arms.
There were several cloth bags like Anne's, sewn from colorful material
and closed with a drawstring. Christine liked the boxes best,

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Is this a lunch? It doesn't have a name on it. Does this belong
to someone?" Miss Waldrop held up the package, slightly grease-stained
on one end and with one of its corners torn and ragged,
and turned it around for all to see.


Christine timidly raised her hand.


"Oh, so it's yours, Christine. If your name had been on it I
would have known."


As she put the package down on the desk, and it seemed to
Christine that she slammed it very hard, the boiled egg cracked
loudly in the breathless quiet. Several children laughed, and Christine
was overcome with shame; she wanted to put her head down
and cry, but Miss Waldrop was at the door directing,


"Line up, children. Form a straight line, straight now. Come
on, follow me, and no talking, no talking. We'll eat our lunches
outside."


The children kept their straight line down the dim hall, up the
steps, and out into the bright sunlight. They stopped to eat at a
low rock wall under an enormous oak tree. Christine's lunch made
a loud crackling noise as she opened the paper, and when the children
looked at it, she could not eat. Little children, enormously
and indiscriminately attracted to anything different, stare only for
this reason; it was Christine herself who caused them to think her
belongings funny and wrong. So totally lacking in self-confidence
and so incapable of accepting either herself or her possessions, she
by her own self-rejection led them to reject her. Her self-degradation
and her abject shame for her lunch container caused her to
deny the savory lunch itself; and, though famished, she was unable
to eat. The others, following her unconscious lead, laughed at
the lunch, which was much more excellent than most represented,

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That night, Christine was quiet, she did not talk about school.
But she asked her mother two questions.


"Mother, will you go to school with me?" Phrased unemotionally
as if she already knew the answer, she gave no explanation
and in no way indicated the importance of this request to her.


"My Lord, Christine," Zueline exclaimed, "you know Mother
can't go to school with you! Mothers don't go to school. And anyway,
I've got to tend to the babies."


Christine well knew that mothers <i>did</i> go to school. There had
been many there today. And she knew in her heart that if her
mother did not have those awful babies, she would go with her.
At that moment, Christine's resentment of her tiny siblings
reached a new peak; and it was not lessened by the fact that she
had to go to bed in a room alone in a big bed, while the babies occupied
her little green bed in the room with Mother and Daddy.
Even though the door was left open and light from the lamp
dimly illuminated the room, she was desperately afraid and just
knew that the monster lurked under the bed. She was careful not
to allow any part of her body to stick over the bedside for fear he
would bite it off, and she wrapped up, head and ears, even though
the weather was hot and sultry.


Her second question was one of pure defense.


"Mother, please, write my name on my lunch tomorrow."


"Did you lose your lunch today, Christine?" Zueline, completely
misunderstanding, and fearing only that the child had
been physically hungry, lectured her on how to nourish the body,
never realizing that it was the little soul that was starving.


At recess time the following day, Christine waited breathlessly
for the lunches to be given out, confident that all would be well
this time, since her name had been boldly written on the wrapping.
She had carefully looked at the name, and it did look pretty
written down--much prettier than it sounded. When the teacher
picked up her lunch, she said to the expectant child,


"I see you have your name written on your lunch today, Christine.
But that wasn't necessary; I would have known that it was
yours."

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048371-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Remembering yesterday's lunch, several children laughed.
Christine was mortified. She grew uncomfortably hot and wished
that she could leave the hated lunch inside. Even her name
looked ugly now. It was an ugly lunch and it was an ugly name!
She remained in her seat until the very last, and then straggled
along at the end of the line, dreading the shameful ordeal of
opening and eating her lunch with the other children. Seeing a
door partly opened by the stair, she ducked in and found herself
in the furnace room, dim and dusty and filled with a big black
machine. Her heart thudded with fear; it looked like a perfect
place for the monster to lurk. But her fear of peer ridicule overcame
her physical fear, and her burning shame and abject misery,
prompted by her gnawing hunger, made the fearsome room preferable
to the open-air companionship of her classmates. She
quickly tore the wrapping from her lunch and chokingly gulped
the boiled egg and the ham biscuit. Stuffing the telltale paper
behind the coal bin, she ran from the room and out of the building
to mingle with the other playing children.


Thus did she eat her lunch on those days when she could escape
from the line and dodge into the frightening furnace room.
Always afraid, she never turned her back on the monstrous black
thing squatting in the middle of the dirty room, and she never
ventured inside more than a few steps; but this lonely, frightful
lunch was more appealing than having her already blighted self-image
daily buffeted by derisive laughter and scorn.


And thus did school, that great socializing institution, fail
Christine. Doing the very best it could, acting on the best knowledge
gleaned from the best sources available, it failed her miserably,
even to the degree of compounding her problems. Her school
career unfolded, as did her life among her family, as a near miss--
the loftiest of intentions, the lowliest of results. In the final cataloguing
of man's mistakes, surely a prominent place must be
devoted to the diligent efforts of educators to force the pliable
stuff of the young into the preconceived mold of the past, instead
of nurturing each new form to grow according to its own bent
into a new, inconceivable future.
