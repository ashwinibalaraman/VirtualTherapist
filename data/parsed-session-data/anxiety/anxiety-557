BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> You know you should just, it's probably fine but, but write your name again.  It said sign and write so.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know if it matters but just sign so it's official.
<b>PT:</b> Do you want to shut off the tape recorder?
<b>DR:</b> No because it's part of the reality.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Now that people are -
<b>PT:</b> Freaked out.
<b>DR:</b> Like oh.
<b>PT:</b> Reality shows.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, so what's doing?  Thank you.
<b>PT:</b> Well, everything is pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Um, my children are doing fine.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> There's a new baby on the way.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> My twin that just got married, well not just, a couple of years ago.  They're having a baby girl.
<b>DR:</b> Which twin got married?
<b>PT:</b> The last one that got married, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER], okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, um, she's giving birth in May.
<b>DR:</b> So you only have the 1 grandson so far.
<b>PT:</b> Two.
<b>DR:</b> Two.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] has 2.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] has 2.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to have to write this down to keep track.  So [NAME OTHER] has [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER] has -
<b>DR:</b> So [NAME OTHER] has 4?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] has 4.
<b>DR:</b> And [NAME OTHER] is -
<b>PT:</b> He's almost, uh, [AGE] but he's not quite.
<b>DR:</b> We'll call him [AGE] and then [NAME OTHER] is expecting a girl.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When?
<b>PT:</b> [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Expecting, that's nice.
<b>PT:</b> So probably when I'm -
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] is a boy right?
<b>PT:</b> Finished with school.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] can be a girl but it's a boy.
<b>PT:</b> No it's a boy.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Little devil.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Cute.
<b>DR:</b> So they're still in Virginia?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And the other guys are in the Ark?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  [NAME OTHER] is looking for a home but -
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> He has to sell his house and then nobody is really coming to look.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  Apartments are, uh, down also.
<b>PT:</b> And he's not really asking an exorbitant amount.  It's just that, uh, hardly anyone comes to the open houses.
<b>DR:</b> And where does he want to move to?
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere commutable to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh, like north Jersey or [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> No, not [DEIDENTIFIED] but he was looking in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh wowy, wowy, wow.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], [LAUGHING], and there's nothing cheap there.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Nothing goes down in that area.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think that's probably true but holy cow.  That's a, that's a ritzy area.  Aye, aye, aye.
<b>PT:</b> So I told him -
<b>DR:</b> He must be doing very well I guess.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's doing very well and so is the other one.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, wow.
<b>PT:</b> They're going to stay in the city for a little bit longer.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Unbelievable.
<b>PT:</b> It is.  They work very hard.  They work 7 days a week sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?  Hm, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Well the big issue in my life I'm involved in a car accident that's finally come to, come due.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Next week.  I'm a nervous wreck over it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> It was my fault.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And the woman is only suing for pain and suffering.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> She is full of crap, excuse my language, [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That's okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, it was on [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] goes up and down.  It's very hilly and gully.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I was on the other side of the hill.  There was nobody in front of me and I was tired but I was still looking at the road but I didn't see that she had stopped just on the other side.  There's no light or anything.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But somebody went into a driveway and she completely stopped and when I came over the mound it was too late and I went into her.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But she only got a few scratches on her bumper.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That was it.  And right -
<b>DR:</b> You were mostly stopped by the time you hit her?
<b>PT:</b> I slide into her, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But you, it slowed down?
<b>PT:</b> But it was enough that my car had $3000.00 worth of damage, [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> So how did your car get it worse than she did?
<b>PT:</b> Because the back for some reason just doesn't, uh, get messed up like the front of the car does.
<b>DR:</b> It didn't it, all dent in and everything?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> She had a big heavy car.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And a Camry isn't.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I thought it was better than what it was.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> When it, the bumper broke of mine -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And the hood kind of went in a little so that had to be replaced.  That's all really.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Nothing inside was damaged.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but as soon as you know this happened I get out of the car and of course she did too and we're looking and, uh, I said how sorry I was and blah, blah, blah and she wouldn't talk to me and the policeman came and she said I want an ambulance and he said you have no damage to your car why do you want an ambulance?  "I want an ambulance.  I have a bad back."
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So they took her away on the stretcher with a neck brace and, uh -
<b>DR:</b> She had a bad back prior to the accident?
<b>PT:</b> Yes and supposedly she needed to have a knee operation, nothing to do with the back and, uh, I don't know where that came from.  So they're going to have to investigate because I think that was a preexisting condition.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So she's giving me a hard time.  I don't know how much money she wants.  Nobody knows yet.  But I'm sure it will be a grand amount and -
<b>DR:</b> How old is the person?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my age.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Got to be around that age, I would say.  A nasty woman.  She wouldn't give me the time of day and really wouldn't, wouldn't talk to me.
<b>DR:</b> But it's your insurance that's -
<b>PT:</b> Right and they're supplying the lawyers.  They do these, this is what they do, these types of cases.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And unfortunately it's no, you know they don't call you.  You don't talk over anything and I can't deal with that.  I have to be prepared and, uh, so I was talking to my boys and, uh, they said well you have to practice what you're going to say and you say too much, don't say too much.  I'm so upset over this I have a lump in my throat from it.  Um, I have to take off from work on Wednesday for this.  She's going to be there as well as her lawyers.  They do it on the same day, both of them which isn't done like that usually in New York.
<b>DR:</b> So it's the deposition?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And, uh, did you get a traffic ticket?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> For the, uh
<b>PT:</b> I was very fortunate.  The guy liked me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He didn't give me a ticket because I had a police card.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And he saw how shaken up I was, you know, and it really wasn't much of anything you know as far as, I don't know, they usually give tickets for accidents but he didn't.
<b>DR:</b> Well if you hit her unfortunately it's your fault but, um, the fact that her car was not that badly damaged, you couldn't have hit her like that hard.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> My wife was hit from behind and it was smushed in you know and uh -
<b>PT:</b> No this car wasn't.  It had very minimal repair.
<b>DR:</b> But, um, my understanding is you only answer to questions.  Don't volunteer any information and that's all you can do.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know you say, you probably shouldn't say, I was tired.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going to say that.  I know that.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> This is when I was traveling to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] day.
<b>PT:</b> This happened very early in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> You know she stopped because of someone else and, uh, I tried to stop but I bumped into her.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> It was an accident.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I'm not denying it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And the insurance company knows.  You know that's a liability.  It's just a matter of how much.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I asked her if my insurance covers it and she said, "Oh yeah.  We would know if it didn't."  My insurance for an individual is only a $100,000.  It's more but just for an injury.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> That's what they pay and God for bid it should that much but -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  But you know hopefully it just gets decided fairly.  You know, she really was injured fine.  If she really wasn't injured then hopefully.
<b>PT:</b> Well, according to the records in hospital she didn't complain about her back at all.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh she's making up stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So.  Her husband was suing me too because she couldn't perform.
<b>DR:</b> No way.
<b>PT:</b> Yep, that was written in the papers.
<b>DR:</b> No way.  That's -
<b>PT:</b> That's how crazy it gets.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's, that's crazy.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> But [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> So he was suing you for, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Non-performance.
<b>DR:</b> Oh my.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, isn't that terrible?
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> They try to get as much as they can from you.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> And that's it.  So with this on my back -
<b>DR:</b> Well then I should sue my in-laws if that's the standard of, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Why what did they do to you?
<b>DR:</b> Well my father-in-law has been very ill so my wife's been you know kind of upset for a long time.
<b>PT:</b> She's commuting to Florida?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, no up here.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, oh.
<b>DR:</b> So you know, it's their fault that, uh, you know he's been in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out of the hospital.  So it's been rough.  You know she, they live in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So it's interesting.  It's not terrible but you know -
<b>PT:</b> It's not a good hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  But -
<b>DR:</b> We think the care has been good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I guess it's as good as the doctor is but um -
<b>PT:</b> It's not as good as [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't think.
<b>DR:</b> Perhaps not but, um -
<b>PT:</b> Maybe it is.  If you have a good doctor that's really -
<b>DR:</b> I think it mostly depends on the doctors.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> In which we feel that that has been good.  But you know he has a lot of complicated problems.  So one thing gets better, one thing gets worse.
<b>PT:</b> So that, I'm also fighting I discovered I have TMJ.  I don't know if you know what that is.
<b>DR:</b> I do.
<b>PT:</b> It's very painful.  And that's nerves.  I'm clinching my mouth when I sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Did they give you -
<b>PT:</b> I have to have something made.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I have something from years ago but they don't use it anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I temporarily use it.  But it doesn't help when I want to go to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It keeps me up.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's just not a comfortable thing to have in your mouth.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> This thing so I hope the next one helps.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I, I was taking so many medicines at one point between the anti-inflammatory for my mouth.  Um, I was sick so I had an antibiotic.  Plus I take 2, uh, medicines for the congestion and the medicine from here.  I had such anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It was terrible.  So I'm not taking the anti-inflammatory now and I'm not taking the antibiotic but I have to take something for the congestion because I have a sinus problem.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So that's all I'm taking that and, and this medicine.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  What are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> Singulair and I was taking Claritin but it's $40.00 a month for that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm going to see if I can get it over-the-counter.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's not exactly the same but, uh, that's a lot of money.
<b>DR:</b> Well, um, you can ask whether any of the -
<b>PT:</b> But Claritin I'll try.
<b>DR:</b> Newer antihistamines are available generically.  That would be less right?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think this one is generic though.  I had Allegra D but that wasn't as good for me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> This seemed to work.  This combination but, uh -
<b>DR:</b> So is Claritin available over-the-counter too?
<b>PT:</b> No, uh, Claritin is but not Clarinex.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> One of the Claritin isn't but Clarin.  One of them.
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> It's all mixed up now.  One is one isn't.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And they feel that I should be using something else that I can buy over-the-counter instead of a prescription.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I'll try.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm also taking once a month, uh, a pill for osteoporosis.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Which is?  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> I have it.
<b>DR:</b> Actonel?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no.  That one didn't agree with me.  Uh, what is it called?  Did you write it down there?
<b>DR:</b> Let's see if I have the last time.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Sally Fields advertises it on TV -
<b>DR:</b> Boniva?
<b>PT:</b> Boniva right.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah okay, so you're still on that then.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How are you doing as far as we're concerned?
<b>PT:</b> I think good.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think it's up more because of what we have to do.  You know it's the valid, validate this program because I want to get rid of the avid program but we're finding that it really helps the kids.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> We have predominately mixed good nonspeaking English children.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And the program really helps them because they do learn English and they learn a lot.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because they're coming from a very environment with nothing, no stimulation, nothing educational.  No books, no nothing.  So they're getting everything here and that give them a little bit of help when they start kindergarten.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but I figured out, I think I have to write 20, 2750 notes, anecdotes.
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> Two thousand seven hundred fifty anecdotes total.  It's 150 anecdotes each child.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And that's what it comes out to because you have to do that for 3 marking periods.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean anecdotes?
<b>PT:</b> We have to observe them and write down notes about their progress in 50 different areas.  There are 50 different, um, developmental areas that we have to observe.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> From social, um, gross development, motor, you know motor development.  Um, cognitive.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Literary.  It's just amazing.  It's unbelievable and you can't get a lot of the children to do half of the stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know half the questions -
<b>DR:</b> There are too many categories -
<b>PT:</b> Because they're just not ready.
<b>DR:</b> To, to evaluate.
<b>PT:</b> That's what we, that's what I said and they said that's what it is, you know.  So there was a big uproar.  Tomorrow we're going, we're going to be involved with a fight.
<b>DR:</b> If it were 10's okay maybe.
<b>PT:</b> Well we feel it's not thoroughly done when you have to look at 50 different areas for each child.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, how can you possibly, uh, evaluate that many areas?
<b>PT:</b> You can't.  You have to remember instead of writing everything which you can't possibly do because they want you to interact with the children.  I have to teach and I'm taking them back and forth to the bathroom.  We can't let them go by themselves.  There's a lot of interruption.  Then there's meetings and what not and when, then today we lost a day.  I don't know you know how to get them all in to tell you the truth.  Neither does anyone else so they make them up.
<b>DR:</b> You know there's, when I, you know my wife's a physical therapist and this is, we all have the same complaint that the emphasis on record keeping is just way out of control.  She works in one of the school systems and she says that a lot of the therapists just sit and do the notes and have the kid like you know play with a toy instead of really -
<b>PT:</b> Helping them.
<b>DR:</b> Doing therapy and interacting.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> They're typing away and when we visit my father-in-law I see the nurses just sitting and typing and typing and typing.  Now when I was in residency the nurse at the end of the shift would write a note this long and that was it.  But now it's you know.
<b>PT:</b> It's unbelievable.
<b>DR:</b> And where I worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] the most important skill you can have is typing because it's, it's phenomenal what they, the expectations, bazaar.
<b>PT:</b> Well my, uh, priority is not writing notes.
<b>DR:</b> I know but you're expected to.
<b>PT:</b> I'm expected to but I want to teach them English.  That's my priority.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I have an assistant but he's very lazy.  So I don't get him, he, to help me write some of these notes down.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So once in a while he'll do me a favor and write some notes.  I mean he's a psychology, he was a psychology major graduated from college but he didn't want to go on for his PhD or anything and he decided he wanted to be a teacher and he's just doing this until he finishes all the courses he has to take I guess.  He's a bright guy but lazy as hell.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm doing everything.  I'm running from here to there trying to teach them, observing what they're doing.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying to get them motivated.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I listen in the teachers' room that the teachers are saying, "Oh they kids don't go to the science area and they don't go to the writing table."  And I'm thinking gee those are the busiest areas in my room.  It's, I make is so interesting they can't stay away.  And I, I think I'm running the classroom well and I'm, I'm doing my job well for the kids but when it comes to the notes, I'm behind now.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And now I'm getting all uptight about it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And them my computer wouldn't boot up.  It's my daughter-in-laws computer and -
<b>DR:</b> I mean if all the teachers -
<b>PT:</b> I can't even do my work.
<b>DR:</b> Is this a statewide mandate?  Is that what you're talking about?  It's just, it's just.
<b>PT:</b> It's everyone.
<b>DR:</b> It's just seems ridiculous.  You know if they had 10 categories to evaluate, people would say all right but 50 I -
<b>PT:</b> And to top it all off -
<b>DR:</b> Can't think of 50 things.
<b>PT:</b> Well to top it all off, there are children that have to be observed for other problems.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> If we're going to refer them.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And that's a whole set of other papers.  [LAUGHING], so if you are really sure when you get into boy you're in deep.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's unbelievable.  And our point was how you could evaluate a child on one note.  You can't.  And that, you know but you, who has time to write up a whole thing because you have all these other things to do.
<b>DR:</b> This is what's happening.  People are more writing than doing.
<b>PT:</b> Well, there is a child in my class that I think is slow.  But I'm hesitating.  His mother is against it.  I spoke to her at open school and I said, "He does not remember his colors.  He doesn't know the alphabet."  Um, he seems to be reverting.  He doesn't want to do anything for himself.  Um, and I think I would like him to be looked at.  And she said, "Nope, I won't have it.  One of my other children was referred and was in special classes and then I know it's an error to there is something wrong and they didn't help him and I don't want him to be referred."  So he's going to leave not prepared for kindergarten.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I did my job and it's documented that I recommended it and everything and the mother doesn't want it so there's nothing that I can do about it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's a whole team that comes in to observe them and a whole business and I have to do the whole paperwork for that.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Every month.  So I don't want to be dealing with that on top of it.  I guess right now the big stress is the computer not working.  I had to go the library.  Thank goodness for the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They had a computer available.  So I did my lesson plans on it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> The next week and I started doing some notes but then I looked at the clock and then that's when you called and I rushed out.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I have to have that computer at my house.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't realize how much I need it.  I live by the computer.  Everything is on the Internet.
<b>DR:</b> Expectation now.  Again, my wife works for a school system and this is expectation that she get online and she [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well the board of ed goes into my files and reads what I write.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And they check up to see if you're up-to-date.  [LAUGHING], big brother is watching and that makes me even more nervous.  And usually I am, um, last time they looked was me and 2 other people were up-to-date.  Everybody else was behind.  This time the teachers would, all of us were so burnt out when they looked in there, only one person I think put notes in and they were upset that we're not doing our job and blah, blah, blah and we're trying to explain that we have it on papers but we didn't get a chance to put it into the computer.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Which is half truth you know it's -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, that plus this accident and my kids don't know if they can come with me and I don't want to go alone.  I'm frightened.  I need that support to be with me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I have nobody.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a friend that could go with you?
<b>PT:</b> Everyone works.  So, I don't know.  Maybe one of my daughter-in-laws could take off.  She's a lawyer in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So maybe she could take off some time.
<b>DR:</b> Then it could be like you're, you're appearing before Congress and you could you know cover up the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], well, but I need that support.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I just hate going into this alone.
<b>DR:</b> It would be nice to have someone to go with.  You're not, you're not dating anyone now?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> No.  I'm just friendly with a companion.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I do things with him.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But that's all it is.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> That's, I'm not meeting anybody.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> People I see around are just not, not for me.  I'd rather be alone.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  You're not doing the online?
<b>PT:</b> I did the online thing.
<b>DR:</b> You're at, you ran out of patience with that?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I did the eHarmony.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I figured that might be better than the others.  It was just as bad.  Um, actually I'm going to cancel it.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> They were sending me a lot of names and they were excellent candidates because they were all highly educated, all professionals but they were in [DEIDENTIFIED], [LAUGHING], I mean they were so far away that I would get back a response from them that you're too far away.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I'm going to go see somebody that's upstate New York?
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?
<b>PT:</b> Or, um, some deep down in Pennsylvania.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> They were sending me people that were much too far away.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And north, northwestern, uh, New Jersey.  A lot from [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Which I would be willing to meet them in the city.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But and half the people that they sent me were already in relationships.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> So, it didn't work out.  None of them.  One person responded really and then after I found out a little about him I realized I don't want to deal with him.  He was married, no children.  His wife committed suicide.
<b>DR:</b> Oh my.
<b>PT:</b> He had a hip operation that didn't heal right.  So he's limping.  I don't need this.  I'd rather be alone.
<b>DR:</b> Well, those are, that thing you told me didn't make me think he might not be a nice person.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, he might be a nice person but he might have some problems too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you're going to meet somebody who has no problems.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Has no problems that would be the first time anyone did.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know.  I, um, I could handle other people's problems easier than my own of course because they're not mine.  But, um, he doesn't know what it's like to have kids and you know my whole life is centered around them.
<b>DR:</b> But he wasn't, um, opposed to anything.
<b>PT:</b> We didn't get that far.  I just cut it off.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe they weren't able to have children.  Do you know why they didn't have children?
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING], I didn't ask him that, no.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe he would have liked to.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't know how long he was married.  Also he, he was a different religion.
<b>DR:</b> Ah.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't care really as long as the person wasn't religious.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But some of them put down the spiritual business and they go to church and all that and I don't want, I don't want that because I'm too Jewish.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  Somebody who doesn't believe in anything is better for me, [LAUGHING], than somebody who is really deep into religion because I can't, I can't get along with someone like that.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Most of them are too fanatical with their beliefs.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Okay.  Well let's see, we changed to the brand in Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah that's okay.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.  Do you notice any difference?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing.  But you feel that you're doing okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Why did we do that?  We just felt that it wasn't that much of a cost difference?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it was, we changed because it was a big cost difference between the, uh -
<b>DR:</b> The branded.
<b>PT:</b> The generic and the brand.  Um, I'm paying $10 a prescription where it was $45 the other way.
<b>DR:</b> You know I'm, uh, I'm confused.  Are you on generic?
<b>PT:</b> I'm on generic.
<b>DR:</b> You're on generic, okay.  But what we did do is we changed from XL to SR.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right?  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> But the generic -
<b>DR:</b> Was still a lot.  The branded was still a lot so it's generic.  That seems fine.  You, if we, if we trace this back, um, you liked the XL but then the XL became available generically and I was a little dubious.  When the 300 became available generically there was some bad reports about it.  So I thought well if you're going to be on generic you might as well be on SR because 150 should be 150.  Um, and it might have been.  I can't remember because it has been so long that I, I suggested brand name but it was such a big price difference that maybe you called me or pharmacy called me and we agreed to to generics.
<b>PT:</b> No, I spoke to you before.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And maybe you thought generic.
<b>DR:</b> So you're on generic but you're on the SR and its going okay.  You didn't notice the market difference?
<b>PT:</b> No, not really.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm still on Luvox.
<b>DR:</b> Right and that's -
<b>PT:</b> Do I need both of them?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Thanks a lot.
<b>DR:</b> Well it seems to me that every time we try to lower it it's not gone well, right?  And you're on modest doses of both.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Luvox you could be 200 or more, Wellbutrin you could be on 400 or more.  Well let's say 400.  So you're on very modest of both of them.  But whenever we've tried to cut down it's not gone that well.  That's what I recollect.  You know eventually we've got you back on.  So it's not bothering you.  I'd say to leave it.  Do you, do you feel that either one is causing a problem that's -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You know?
<b>PT:</b> Not really.  I just thought one of these days I wouldn't have to take anything.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I mean if you were adamant that you wanted to do something, I, I would, I'd support it but the flip side is, it took us a long time to find this and then you're doing well and I think we have tried once or twice to lower things and you didn't do as well.  So, I would say if it's causing no harm, you're feeling well, I would leave it.  What happened with the vocal cord nodes?
<b>PT:</b> It healed.
<b>DR:</b> That got better?
<b>PT:</b> Because I didn't work during the summer.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  So that did get better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.
<b>PT:</b> It will come back.
<b>DR:</b> From over use.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I have to raise my voice to these kids.  They don't respond to a soft voice.
<b>DR:</b> That's a hard -
<b>PT:</b> It's very hard.
<b>DR:</b> Some people don't have a naturally booming voice.
<b>PT:</b> And also we do a lot of singing.  I'm giving a lot of directions all day long.
<b>DR:</b> Let the psychologist do the singing.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> And the yelling.
<b>PT:</b> One of the suggestions was to have the master teacher come in the room and take notes, interact with the kids, and teach the lesson all at the same time, let's see how you do it.  Because we can't believe a person could really do this.  But she said, "Absolutely not.  You're not beginner teachers and I will not do that."  How do you like that?
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Because I don't think anyone could do this.  So the only thing you can possibly do is try the best you can at some of the areas that are not so important just you know figure something to write down.
<b>DR:</b> I just think they're having you do a ridiculous amount of documentation.
<b>PT:</b> The state wants it.
<b>DR:</b> I mean it's just not smart because I don't see how precise you can be.  You know -
<b>PT:</b> You can't.
<b>DR:</b> How, how can you possibly.
<b>PT:</b> If you had one child maybe.
<b>DR:</b> That's, that's so many, I think you lose precision when you break it down into a million different categories.  You know.
<b>PT:</b> Well.  My suggestion was not to look at all 50 each marking period.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> To look at a certain amount each period and concentrate more on those than the whole shebang and maybe it would be more accurate.
<b>DR:</b> I would just be curious to see the list.  I mean it has to be many shades of grey.
<b>PT:</b> I have it in my car.
<b>DR:</b> But, I'm, I'm telling you in all the different disciplines it's the same story.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> It's a bummer.  I, the computer has really made things so much more work.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you're right.
<b>DR:</b> It's supposed to be such a work saving device, compute, more to do.
<b>PT:</b> The thing that's sad about it, they can go in and read what you write.  They check up on you constantly.
<b>DR:</b> But it, it just allows them to create, you know the expectation just seems to grow and grow and grow and grow.  After awhile you just type it in.
<b>PT:</b> It's not just typing it in.
<b>DR:</b> People spend their whole life just typing nonsense into the, it's terrible.
<b>PT:</b> I know.  That's the way it is and it seems that we can't change it and the answer to us is that's the way it is.
<b>DR:</b> I think that all the teachers teaching at this level would have to unite and say, "Let's come up with something -
<b>PT:</b> Something better.
<b>DR:</b> Better."  Yo know that's practical and -
<b>PT:</b> Well you realize the teacher didn't make this up.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], more useful.
<b>PT:</b> The teacher did not make this up.  Uh, we have to give a, it's called and EZR.  It's a test to see where the child is at at the beginning of the year and I told the, I don't know if she's a social worker or whatever she is there that some of the questions are too advanced.  They have analogies.  The children that don't speak English, I want you to know analogies, "A table is made out of wood.  A window is made out of?"  Not one child that I ever had knew the answer to that question.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I said, "What does that show?"  And some of the other analogies too.  They were just too difficult.  The kids can't do it.  They don't understand and if that's what the, um, riff, the speaking part is than that is not a good evaluation of what a child knows.  So, and then they're given an object and they have to describe it.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> They have to say it on their own without any hints which is impossible for most of them.  I say tell me about this object.  And I hand them a button, a big blue button with 4 holes.  They don't even, first of all half of them don't even know what it's called.  Some of them know the color.
<b>DR:</b> Many of the children may not have ever seen, ever seen a table that was made out of wood.
<b>PT:</b> That's true too.  That's true.
<b>DR:</b> They, they use to on the intelligence tests ask about Louis Armstrong and some, I think they had to change it because you know there was no more, it wasn't relevant.  It wasn't taught in schools.  It wasn't something that was common knowledge anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Well this test is, some of it, some of its okay.  I can see but the validity of this test is awful.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So and I know it wasn't done by an educator.  It and to be done unfortunately by somebody who doesn't know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> The development of these children.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know who writes them.  I mean, um, I worked in, uh, in [DEIDENTIFIED].  That's the name of the place that writes up all the, uh -
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [DEIDENTIFIED].  I worked for [DEIDENTIFIED] one summer.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I saw what goes into each question.  It's really hard.  You have to be, you can't be, you can't favor one group over another.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> With the sex and this and that.  It was amazing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know so they need to redo it.  It's old, antiquated too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, all right.
<b>PT:</b> But this is the new one.
<b>DR:</b> Let me stop this thing.  Well -
