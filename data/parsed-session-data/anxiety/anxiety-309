"THE situation," said Joan Face, "What do I think
of it? Good Lord, don't ask me. I've been incapable
of any kind of thought since I got this place.
Didn't even know Chamberlain had gone until somebody
told me Churchill was Prime Minister three days
later. I was much too busy getting in here."


"The situation," said Gerry Face, "What do I think
about it? Not me. I don't think. I just go and have
another beer."


"Your friend, Archibald Sinclair, has done well for
himself, hasn't he?" said Joan.


"He deserves to," I said stoutly.


"I hope he's going to find a place for you," said Joan
in her pointed fashion.


We sat on the small lawn of The Jolly Sailor Inn, Saltford,
in the peace of the summer evening and looked
across the lock and the weir to the green hillside that
sloped up to the picturesque stone village of Kelston and
then away up to the clump of trees at the top, and along
the sluggish insanitary flow of the Avon on its way from
Bath to Bristol. It seemed as if, as we sat there in the sunset,
it must be peace like this everywhere. But, of course,
this was not so. It was July, 1940, and Hitler had invaded
the Low Countries and over-run France and Chamberlain
had gone some six weeks previously (even though Joan
had not noticed it at the time) and when one thought
about it the situation was pretty grim.

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was better, however, not to think about it. It was
better to do as Gerry Face did and go and have another
drink and then the situation mellowed somewhat and did
not look quite so fearsome.


I had just registered in as the first permanent resident
of "The Jolly Sailor," Saltford, of which Joan had
recently become the tenant and licensee—thus fulfilling
a lifelong ambition.


Much had happened since Joan Face had left "The
Marlborough Arms" the previous year. The War, for one
thing.


Whatever else this book may be, it is not a "war
book" and my own unobtrusive part in hostilities occupy
little space. Six years service in His Majesty's Forces
prevent the War, however, from being entirely absent
from my pages. It was in November, 1938, following
the Munich Agreement and as soon as the excitement of
the Oxford by-election had subsided, that, uncomfortably
conscious of the inconsistency between preaching resistance
to aggression and doing nothing practical about it,
I was persuaded without difficulty by my friend, Hugh
Whitelocke, to join the Territorial Army, R.A.M.C.
and to take the post of Medical Officer to the 252 Anti-Aircraft
Battery, R.A., just then being formed in
Oxford by Major G. D. Amery.


Mine was not one of the more heroic parts in the war
against Hitler, but at least I had the satisfaction of being
among the first—under appropriate instructions from the
Army Council—to show fight. As early as July, 1939, I
had found myself self-consciously parading London in
my newly acquired uniform, resisting aggression so it
seemed entirely by myself, the only person in sight in
Service Dress (the Regular Army were still wearing
civilian clothes off duty)—an integral part, in fact the
only visible part, of what Mr. Chamberlain had called
"our terrifying might." This was during the "partial

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then came the imminence of War. The manning of the
anti-aircraft guns in earnest: the clutching of ineffective
gas masks: the good-byes of happily and unhappily
married alike.


Chris drove me up to London to join the unit. The
portion of the unit which I was to join was the 249
Battery under the command of Major Weir which had
what seemed at the time the unpropitious duty of
defending the Waltharn Abbey Gunpowder Factory with
Lewis guns. We stayed the night with our friends the
Agnews and, after I had deposited my equipment at the
Cock Hotel, Waltham Abbey, we drove together a part
of the way along the North Circular Road.


"Good-bye darling." Standing on the pavement, we
exchanged a perfunctory kiss—the usual ten-years-married
kiss. But, as we did so, the realization came to us.
We might not see each other again—ever. We clung to
each other's hands for a minute and Chris turned and
kissed me a second time, no longer in perfunctory
fashion, but eagerly as if we were still lovers.


"Good-bye, darling," said Chris. "Do take care. God
keep you safe. I love you."


The disagreements and misunderstandings of years
slipped away. I felt a warm glow as I played my part of
the beloved husband staying in a place of danger.

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't worry, darling," I said, reassuringly. "There
may not be a War."


But, of course, there was a War with the consequent
evacuation of London and the air raid sirens echoing at
five minutes past twelve through half-deserted streets.
But there was no air raid just then. And the people of
Britain, not to mention their Government, having made
the mental effort to defy Hitler were inclined to "call it
a day" and let things take their course.

After a month of Waltham Abbey and the continuous
expectation of bombs it was blessed relaxation to find
myself down on the South Coast safe and sound, a still
intact part of the mysterious world of Army capital
letters, first as M.O. of the R.M.P. at Emsworth, Hants.,
then attached to the 80th Regiment H.Q. in the idyllic
surroundings of Botley Hill House, with no worse
terror in life than the Colonel's passion for bridge. It
was blessed relaxation to lie back on the mental feather
bed of Army life instead of worrying myself to a frazzle
over the perpetual financial uncertainty of the hotel; to
find myself drawing a certain, steady income at the end
of each month just by filling up the appropriate Army
forms for pay and allowances—through which I was so
ably piloted by our kindly second-in-command, Jumbo
Treharne. It was luxury to have my every want attended
to by an Army batman without the continual overhang of
staff problems, or threat of "Notice"! It was reassuring
to regain the prestige of again belonging to my own profession
and, indeed, gratifying to find what an important
person in a regiment a Medical Officer was, and how he
was the only person who could stand up to, and on
occasions over-rule, the Colonel. (I liked over-ruling

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My newly-acquired feeling of importance was no whit
diminished when I finished my sick parades by 11 a.m.
and had the remainder of the day in which to slip off
unobserved, if possible, to the Stoneham Park Golf
Course, undisturbed either by emergency calls or by
harrowing thoughts of anxious mothers as in my days in
general practice.


Moreover, the easy-going masculine good-fellowship
of the Mess of the 80th Regiment was a change from
the atmosphere in which I had been living during the
preceding months. Increasing uncertainty had been
afflicting both Chris and myself in regard to our future.
We had drifted into that uncomfortable, but all too
frequent, state of married lack of bliss in which we
neither of us spoke more than a few words to the other
from one week to the next. Outwardly perhaps our
marriage had remained intact, but more and more it
was becoming an empty shell, whose brittle structure
might crack at any moment and reveal the void within.
Though both dreading any form of separation, the feeling
had been growing on us that separation was becoming
inevitable.


Now, however, the War had solved this vexing problem.
War Service had made separation between husband and
wife not only respectable, but positively laudable; it had
somehow regularized the position that existed between
us. The reconciliation that had taken place at our parting
on the North Circular Road was not only mutual, but
genuine. As the autumn went on, it was fun to see Chris
on my brief leaves. There was no doubt about it. Chris
was an extremely attractive person—provided you didn't

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Moreover Chris was doing a useful wifely task in
looking after the hotel. In fact, during the first weeks of
the War, when Derek Kenderdine had been called to
rejoin the Navy a few days after my own mobilization,
Chris had shown business capabilities the existence of
which I had hitherto not suspected.


It was only a pity that Chris seemed unable to keep up
her form!


For, to help her in her wifely task, Chris had soon coopted
a succession of willing and equally unattached lady
helpers who over a period of weeks formed a feminine
interregnum which would doubtless make one of the most
unusual periods in the unusually chequered history of
"The Marlborough Arms" if the details were available.
I am, however, unable to supply these for, perhaps
mercifully, I was denied them myself.


In retrospect, anyway, no light dawns upon this
scene until the appearance of the rather more sombre
masculine figure of my friend and accountant, Harold
Jones. Harold, whom (rather neglectfully) this is my first
occasion to mention, had already been "the backroom
boy" of my affairs for some ten years since my first days
in medical practice, from which position he had fought
many a doughty, and not always unsuccessful, battle on
my behalf with the Inspector of Taxes. However, genial
and humorous, endowed with mental capabilities the
equal of any accounting and tabulating machine, Harold
now steps into the limelight in his capacity as residuary
legatee for all the various packets of trouble left behind
by those of us, his clients, who had sacrificed ourselves
to our country's need and who, in reward for this, could
now sit back and watch civilians doing our work for us.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a letter cautiously marked "Without Prejudice" and
dated November 18th, 1939, I find the following:
<blockquote>
<p>
"I am sure you must be as worried about ‘The Marlborough
Arms’ as I am. So far as the technical side of the business is concerned
I am afraid that your wife's temperament is a negative factor.
Particularly is this so with reference to the handling of the staff."
</p>
</blockquote>


"I am sure you must be as worried about ‘The Marlborough
Arms’ as I am. So far as the technical side of the business is concerned
I am afraid that your wife's temperament is a negative factor.
Particularly is this so with reference to the handling of the staff."


The situation demanded action and Harold's solution
was, it seems, "a hair of the dog that bit you." He had a
secretary-housekeeper (there had already been a succession
of some four secretary-housekeepers in six weeks),
a Mrs. Murphy who "with her experience" "will be in a
better position to help than anyone else" and who "is
reporting at the end of each week."


"If this does not succeed I am doubtful if it is worth
while keeping on the hotel." So came Harold's final sorry
verdict.


But Mrs. Murphy fades out, sunk without trace. For
we hear no more of her! Despite this we find that, in a
further letter from Harold in December, a trading statement
is "reasonably satisfactory."


So "The Marlborough Arms" staggered through into
another year.


In the meantime, unsuspected at the time by any of us,
another phase in its history had started with the engagement
by Chris at a salary of £3 per week jointly of Mr.
Max and Mrs. Joyce Ehrsam.


Max Ehrsam needs, in the circumstances in which I
write, little publicizing by me. Let it be briefly said that,
in the autumn of 1939, Max's dynamism had taken one
of its more devious turns in the shape of a quarrel with
brother Alphonse, whom he had been assisting at the

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Max Ehrsam's abilities in due course found scope in
my service. But, to start with, there was much stormy
weather for, in the early months of the year 1940, alarums
and excursions from Woodstock started to butt their way
through even the thick insulation of my Army life.
Urgent phone calls tended now to interrupt me on sick
parade in the morning, or perhaps during my enjoyment
of a pre-lunch sherry.


Maybe it would be Max:


Madame had left the hotel and had been away for two
days without letting anyone know beforehand or leaving
instructions. She had come back yesterday and was giving
the staff orders contradictory to his own.


Madame insisted on having officers in, drinking after
hours—they would have the police in.


Madame had come back from Oxford and had altered
all his menus. She was working with the chef behind his
back and if she wanted the b——— b——— b——— chef to
run the hotel, then I had better say so and he would go.
He himself knew exactly what the chef was up to.


So much Max.


I would stammer reassurances over the phone. I hoped
to get away on leave on Saturday week, then we could have
a good talk. Perhaps things could be left over until then?
With a sigh of relief I would make my way back to the
Mess to immerse myself once again in that River of
Forgetfulness that is Army life.


But half an hour later, I would be summoned back to
the phone box for another trunk call which would come
through after the usual interminable delays at the camp
switchboard.


This time it would be Chris:

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Max was impossible to get on with. He was always
trying to over-rule her and she was not going to have it.
Either she was manageress of the place or she wasn't.
Which was it? Was she left in charge?


"Of course, dear," I replied uncertainly.


"Aren't you prepared to trust your own wife?" asked
Chris angrily, detecting my uncertainty.


"Well ——-" I prevaricated.


I would have been readier to give a firm "Yes" had I
not known Christiane's penchant for combining business
with pleasure and confusing the two.


I realized what would be happening at "The Marlborough
Arms." I knew that Chris's spasms of concentrated
hard work were only too likely to be punctuated
by equally energetic dashes to London during
which she would cheerfully leave the hotel to "run itself."
In fact she made no attempt to conceal these escapades.
She merely expected this erratic behaviour to be accepted
as the normal way of life—anyone who did not behave
similarly was labelled as "slow"!


Anyway, there was little or nothing that I could do
over the telephone. The most reassuring factor of the
situation was that the War had livened up both Woodstock
and "The Marlborough Arms" quite a lot and,
quarrel as they might, Chris and Max Ehrsam were
running the place and takings were increasing. In any
case, I thought, Chris and Max could get on with it.
Ten to one they would settle their difficulties before I
could get back on leave to do it for them.


There were, moreover, many more immediate problems
in the life of an Army Medical Officer than the
pacification of "The Marlborough Arms." There was,
for instance, the 'flu epidemic when almost the entire
regiment lay with high temperatures strewn about the
bare floors of the empty houses that were serving for
barracks; or the competition with the living conditions of

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, the problems of "The Marlborough Arms"
still awaited me on my leaves. Increasingly I felt that the
place was only a nuisance and that, with a long period of
military service in front of me, I must cut my commitments,
sell the hotel and live on my Army salary.


The decision to do this was, however, postponed on
account of events that took place on a wider scale.


(3)


In my business calculations I could face up to it that
I would be in the Services for an interminable time ahead,
yet when it came to politics I had—to start with anyway—a
mental blind-spot on this question. The outbreak of War
seemed merely an incidental interruption in the career
of a successful Opposition politician—something that
might temporarily retard, yet could not long postpone,
the vindication of the sacrifices I had made and the work
I had done. Why! The fact of War itself was the culminating
proof of the way in which the Liberal platform
had been right!


Secure in my feeling of destiny, therefore, I took a
philosophical view of my "embodiment" and the consequent
restriction of political activities that it entailed.

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For the moment, therefore, I reconciled myself to
circumstances, to holding on in single-minded purpose,
regardless of other considerations. The docile British
public, moreover, in those early stages of the War
followed its mentors in giving short shift either to Party
politics or to political critics. It was only when two or
more restless-minded people gathered together that it
was agreed that this sort of thing could not last. When,
as M.O., in charge of troops at the Enfield Small Arms
Factory, I discovered that, as opposed to the German
armament factories which were working night and day,
our own factories shut their gates from Saturday mid-day
to Monday morning, I could see with my own eyes that
this sort of thing could not last.


One had to extract consolation from the thought that
this situation was bound to blow up in one way or the
other. In fact, I began to view it, though from a different
angle and for different reasons, with much the same complacency
as was evinced on every side of me.


I plunged myself into the phoney War and its manifold
diversions with enthusiasm that was second to none,
though it was during this time that, in the quiet and
lonely evenings at the R.M.P.'s I wrote my first book.
As might be expected, it was a political book—eventually
to be accepted for publication by Jonathan Cape—a book

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then came the invasion of Norway—the fall of
Chamberlain—the break-through on the Western Front
—Dunkirk.


Viewing a crisis in prospect, I had scarcely conceived
of it as like this. I found myself, instead of slipping
quietly away to play golf, dashing violently around;
making up for lost time in giving First Aid lectures to the
troops; going into gory detail of how to put on a shell
dressing, of how to apply a tourniquet to a bleeding limb.
While on more than one occasion men fainted in the
tense and crowded huts as a tribute to my lecturing skill.


From the moment when you woke up and thought,
"Oh, my God" as you realized the position afresh, every
morning was nightmarish. It was only after two or three
beers at lunch that the situation did not seem quite so bad.
But by 3.30 in the afternoon it was desperate again—and
it was time to get back to the Mess for another drink.
Then in the evening the outlook depended entirely on the
amount of alcohol you managed to consume. I use the
plural "you" because everyone was in the same boat.
That is everyone with the exception of the Quartermaster,
a British Israelite, whose readings of the Pyramids
left him no room for doubt that, despite all appearances
of disaster, Britain would be victorious. Serene, bespectacled,
the Quartermaster alone kept steadily, never
varying, to his single pint of beer, morning and evening.


"There you are," said the Colonel. "What are you
people looking so gloomy about? Look at Steve. Why!
We must have at least half a dozen tanks in this country
—though God knows where they are!"

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Who could avoid feeling gloomy? My complacent
mood of the winter had fallen away. A renewed feeling of
urgency welled up inside me. I wanted to do something.
To do something in a big way, something that I felt to be
consistent with my abilities, to put things right. I cursed
the tie of my humble duties as a Regimental Medical
Officer. My spate of First Aid lectures satisfied my conscience,
but consumed only a fragment of my mental
energies. It merely meant that, as far as my daily habits
were concerned, instead of taking exercise on the golf
course, I spent more time in mooning round the Mess,
drinking interminable bottles of beer to keep up my
spirits, listening to the pep talks on the wireless with their
fatuous ending of "until ultimate victory is achieved,"
a helpless spectator of these large events which I was
powerless in any way to influence.


It was as an outlet to my sense of urgency that I made
up a memorandum and sent it in to the Ministry of
Information. It was a memorandum on the same lines as
the book I was writing and I obtained an interview with
Sir Walter Monckton, then Director of the M.O.I., on
the strength of it—and on the additional strength of
Walter Monckton being the brother-in-law of my former
associate, Max Colyer-Fergusson.


Filled with the impetus of my pent-up energies,
interrupting my First Aid lectures for an afternoon, I
sped up to the London University building in Malet
Street, which then housed the Ministry of Information.


On my arrival the nominal activities of the Ministry of
Information appeared to be subordinated to the more
important business of making tea, of distributing tea
round the building in large trolleys and drinking tea
when it was distributed.


"I expect you think we do nothing but drink tea here,"
remarked the chatty liaison officer with whom I talked
for a while, as he partook of his tea from an extra large

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, I saw Sir Walter Monckton.


"You've written a most interesting memorandum,"
said Walter Monckton genially, "But it's not my province.
I've passed it on to the proper quarter and I expect you'll
hear from them. Have you seen friend Max recently?
Extraordinary cove, isn't he? May I offer you a cup of
tea?"


I drank my cup of tea and returned to camp and a
further stretch of impotent waiting. But I heard nothing
further.


Inevitably I started to live my own inner life. Outwardly
maybe I was an inconspicuous Regimental
Medical Officer, but in myself I was Donald Johnson,
Liberal politician, waiting to step into rightful opportunity—opportunity
for self-realization in the wide field
of national affairs.


Anyway, Chamberlain had gone. Churchill had come
to power with new leaders in his Government—the
leaders of the Opposition Parties and the Churchill
Tories. We could exult in a new Government—even if
some aspects of this Government gave rise to more sober
thoughts. For here were the old discredited leaders—the
Chamberlainites—the Appeasers—still holding high
positions of State. Here was the Party Truce still in
existence with the Conservative Party entitled to unopposed
succession to nearly 400 seats in Parliament
while the Liberal Party had only fifteen. But I could not
face the implications of this. I consoled myself that this
was a makeshift arrangement—a makeshift in an emergency.
It must be a makeshift!


I began to visualize the political situation in apocalyptic
fashion, and as the central figure of my vision I saw my
political idol—the leader of the Liberal Party, Sir
Archibald Sinclair, now Minister for Air in the new

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nothing could be done at the moment, except carry
on with one's exasperating routine duties. Then, if
we survived the summer, there would no doubt be the
breathing space. I would go and see the Leader—that
affable personality who had been so encouraging in
regard to my previous efforts. Naturally I could not see
him just now. But perhaps I could see him later on and,
in the meantime, I would compose a memorandum and
send it to him.


It was an evening early in June as I lay awake in bed
in my sleeping quarters at the Militia Camp, Botley,
reflecting over my memorandum. From the N.A.A.F.I.
Dance Hall over on the other side of the square came the
strains of the band playing "There'll always be an England."
My body tossed and turned: my mind cogitated
on my memorandum; while in spirit I wrestled with
something intangible. It was an odd, absurd, uncanny
feeling. There were no defences anywhere. There were
no barriers of time or space. There was no consciousness
of other people. (Even the Leader had for the moment
been consigned to oblivion.) There was just myself
and the lusty young voices singing "There'll always be
an England" and Hitler. There were the things that we
stood for: and the evil things that Hitler stood for. And,
whatever daytime appearances there might be to the
contrary, here in the night I knew only one thing—that
the things we stood for must prevail.


"There'll always be an England" came across the camp
echoing my own spiritual struggles. But would there
always be an England? Surely not without a military
miracle in the first place; and regeneration through a
spiritual miracle in the second? But those miracles must

(5)


The following day I heard that I had been posted as
Military Medical Liaison Officer to the Hospitals Officer,
Ministry of Health (South-West Region), 3, Woodland
Road, Bristol. It was a posting that, I knew, could only
have been made in deference to an application which I
had put in some three months previously for an administrative
appointment in England and I experienced a
certain unheroic elation at the news of it. For my application
had had only one purpose—to enable me to keep
in touch with political events, to hold my services available
for use in the sphere where, in the pride of my heart,
I flattered myself that they were most needed.


As I drove my car out of the camp and turned its nose
towards Bristol, I felt that my first step was achieved.


A bare three hours later I was settled in at "The Jolly
Sailor" and starting to discuss the situation with Joan
and Gerry Face.
