Transcript:
<b>DR:</b> And thank you very much.
<b>PT:</b> Sure, no problem.
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad to see you looking so well, since we just started the Paxil 50 mg last time.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How's that sitting with you?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's doing me a good bit better.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent, excellent.
<b>PT:</b> I remember trying, uh 20 a while ago.  It was too much.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that must have been quite a while ago?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, years.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Any, okay.  Um, at first it, it did cause a little more anxiety —
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b> But it was worth it because it was flattening out the um, uh, the moods I had I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, now I guess I'm used to it so —
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if there's any more anxiety because of it or not I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> And in the past you'd always looking at anxiety and in just —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Recently we've been talking about depression and how that you know could play in and —
<b>PT:</b> It all mixes in together.
<b>DR:</b> Different traits and you know with what you learned about your family and you know being able to say "we're targeting the depression also" is a plus and there, you have lorazepam that may help for anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Have you used that at all together with this uh —
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know with Paxil —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> At this [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, definitely makes a difference.
<b>DR:</b> Good okay in a good way?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good, excellent.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I be, I'd become so depressed for a while it was um, like it absolutely overwhelming.  It was nothing I could do.
<b>DR:</b> It was overriding the anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Quite a bit for so long —
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> It was all about the anxiety —
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> You know.  Exactly you finally put that together.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah —
<b>PT:</b> I think what that Paxil does is sort of makes everything less of an event and more of uh, whatever it is.  Instead of becoming so um, distraught over things that, that it made everything I did into a uh, much more emotion than is necessary.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, maybe like a bigger deal —
<b>PT:</b> Yep, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Than maybe losing the perspective —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know and now it seems you know just based on what you're telling me about starting this 15 mg.  You're taking things in stride now more.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because if I would go to the shore, like I'd take the uh, [DEIDENTIFIED] bus and I'll go down there and for a while, like my sister doesn't go anymore.  She went through too many rough times.  Did want to do anything for a while, so I'd be down there and be thinking "how different it was without her" and I'd get so depressed.  Now I go down there and just take it in for what it is instead of making why of it.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you, maybe almost make yourself, I've done this before —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know maybe the anxiety part is out of it and now you're overcoming some of the depression which helps you realize oh it's not a big deal I have to catastrophized about going with out her —
<b>PT:</b> That's the work.
<b>DR:</b> I can do this.
<b>PT:</b> That's it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's the word.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um, that's exactly what it is.  To make, instead of making a crisis out of everything that's, that's a good word for it too.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  How is your sleep, you staying on a good sleep pattern.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not really but it's like I, it takes a lot to fall asleep, maybe an hour or so sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Then I usually wake up shortly after I fall asleep and um, I can usually get enough, I don't think I need as much as I used to, I don't.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm never really tired.  I mean I, I walk all the time —
<b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> Seriously.
<b>DR:</b> That's 1 reason you're in shape.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> I do.
<b>PT:</b> I go to the shore I uh, walk the entire 5 1/2 hours I never stop.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you that's excellent.
<b>PT:</b> And it's like um, I don't know, I think I'm more driven person than I think —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I've wasted a lot of that drive though.  Worry, my sister has calmed down a good bit uh, I guess most of what she was going through was probably done.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Tremendous amount of damage in the past 2 years, tremendous.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um —
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel as though you 2 are starting to come to terms like with, sort of taking a deep breath and say "okay, where do we go from here."
<b>PT:</b> Yes, midlife time has set in —
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Both of us —
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> People change when they hit this midlife 40s and everything we're doing now has got to change.
<b>DR:</b> And there's been a paradigm shift to because with your other sisters lose —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You probably, you imagined yourself going through later years with 2 siblings.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now it's you and 1 sister.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it's changed everything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's um, nothings ever going to be the same in the family.  Uh, like we had a life up to her death and life after.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like —
<b>PT:</b> The only thing that has changed is, is my social phobias changed tremendously —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> After what I went through here there's very little the world can do to me, very little.  I used to take everything so seriously and I really don't car much about what anybody else has to say or even much about anything else.  I've uh, numb anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like the news shows that try to scare me, there's nothing they can tell me, nothing.  I'm absolutely unconcerned with the world anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Of course news shows are selective about what they tell you about and they're going to hype certain things —
<b>PT:</b> Oh, sure, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So I guess I uh, I learned from her over reaction to what people said to her when she lost that job —
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> To the point where uh, I can't imagine reacting to anything anymore like that —
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I used to.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> She was the same way all of us grew up with the social phobias.  Other sister sort of get a grip on it, she still brings home the people she works with and drives her self nuts and me too.  But she's starting to get to the point where uh, way more important things in the world.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly and you just can't control anybody else and once, now that you've addressed the depression you have that core of inner strength to say "I really don't care what they think."
<b>PT:</b> I agree.
<b>DR:</b> In other words you have your own perspective and the strength to hold to it.  In stead of being so influenced by what somebody else is saying or thinking.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it took a long time in therapy because uh, I used to argue with the therapist all the time.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I'm right they're wrong.  I have to react.
<b>DR:</b> What about reasons to be anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm no good —
<b>DR:</b> Reasons for social phobia?
<b>PT:</b> Everybody's better than me.  They're all out to get me, now I've, most, most people aren't even interested in my life so why would I care and even if they are what are they going to do to me.  So, 2 years of horrific damage —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But we both learned from them, I hope, I hope.  Um, I'm still waiting for a psych evaluation and some part time work.  Uh, I'm not really worried about it I just wish I'd done it a long time ago and maybe I could, you know better path to something.
<b>DR:</b> Is there anything you need me to fill out?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.
<b>DR:</b> Evaluation wise or —
<b>PT:</b> Everything is ready to go.
<b>DR:</b> Okay good.
<b>PT:</b> Just takes time I guess because they have a lot of people waiting online so, or waiting in line for this.
<b>DR:</b> Did you ever hear back from the post office?
<b>PT:</b> No we can't even get a, a date for a test —
<b>DR:</b> That is so aggravating.
<b>PT:</b> Well the thing is they're, they're going to have to cut people because they're in trouble.
<b>DR:</b> Um —
<b>PT:</b> And uh, they got too many people already in line to take this test.  My guess is they're going to lay a lot of people off.  I was really hoping to get in there.
<b>DR:</b> I know you prepared —
<b>PT:</b> That would have been perfect.
<b>DR:</b> You laid the ground work.
<b>PT:</b> But when you go online they will not let you take the test.  It says "we have too many applications now."  So, if it ever comes up, I'm there.  But —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.  I'm glad you're looking elsewhere though.
<b>PT:</b> I have to —
<b>DR:</b> That makes a lot of sense.
<b>PT:</b> I have to have way more plans than this.  I'm going to have to try to establish a work record with part time —
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> And then think about some type of schooling.  That way if somebody says "where've you been working?"  I say "here" then I'll have that.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.  You know since you've started the Paxil 15 mg I'm hearing much more proactive things —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know if this is in my control —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> To influence this, excellent.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah the uh, depression level I had was so, so powerful.  But it was almost like I had uh, I clipped the anxiety with it —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Even though the anxiety was still there.  This was just so much worse.  So I don't know what's going to happen with uh, this part time whatever but whatever it is I'm not really concerned about what anybody thinks about me there or —
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> What are they going to do to me?
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum and you're looking at giving it a try for all the right reasons.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.  What I want to do is try to get back on some type, kind of, what's the word.  See it's like the dentist, I worried about the dentist for 20 years, I didn't go.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I found out that worrying about it for 20 years was way worse than me sitting in that chair for an hour.
<b>DR:</b> Often the fear of the unknown —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is much worse than the actuality.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And maybe once you finally start to clear away some of the specters of anxiety and then you have some major life stressors.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> That's where the depression came to the floor.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think so to.
<b>PT:</b> Because I've never really dealt with that much depression for to, for most of my life.  Now either I'm uh, getting a grip on the anxiety level —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe it was always there, I don't know.  It's hard to say which was which.
<b>DR:</b> But it's so true —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know [INAUDIBLE] back through the years, it was always the anxiety diagnosis —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah it was.
<b>DR:</b> Prominent, social phobia, anxiety —
<b>PT:</b> Well that's why I didn't need an antidepressant for so long.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yep.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know it's, it's uh, it's manageable now I think —
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Because I know what it is.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's not a mystery.  I used to attach a whole lot of different things to it.  Mostly I just blamed myself for it.  But the thing with once I start some type of job, see I'm still stalling.  I'm still dragging my feet, once I'm there then.  Like the dentist hadn't been there in 20 years —
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> When I went in there, even after they told me all the major work it would take.  I thought okay I —
<b>DR:</b> At least I know what I'm dealing with —
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's what it is.  So, I'm still stalling on some of this stuff.  But once I'm there —
<b>DR:</b> But you're recognizing it.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Once I'm there I'm done with it.  It won't be as hard as, as it's been to, to live through these past 2 years.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> And the nightmare at home, my sister kept working right through it too.  Never missed any days —
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> She used to call me up hysterical.  I'd say "just get it all out, get this together, get through this thing."  Boy that was an awful time, oh God awful time.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes people cling to the structure too, you know in terms of helping them cope with a crisis or tragedy.  Just as long as the demands of that structure don't add way more stress, you know.
<b>PT:</b> I think so, I mean if I know she quit this we'd be finished in a hurry.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So she probably keeps that in mind.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Took 2 years to get through this I guess.
<b>DR:</b> And you're getting through with flying colors.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I hope so.  I always tell her the same thing.  I say "you went through the worst of menopause" every woman in the family went through the worst of it.  She kept working at a place where she couldn't stand anymore.  She had this tremendous tragedy dumped on top of her —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, whatever I'm, I'm uh, I'm focusing on myself now.  What I need to do —
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> To get rid of this, to walk through, in to this midlife thing prepared —
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's be great to stay 20 —
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> My God it'd be great.
<b>DR:</b> But you know what they say —
<b>PT:</b> No idea.
<b>DR:</b> You're as young as you feel.
<b>PT:</b> I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> But also by addressing your depression it helps keep you healthier; because so much of chronic illness —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know generates depression vise versa they drag each other down and by being on top of the depression once we saw it brewing —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> That will definitely pay off in the health department overall health department as well.
<b>PT:</b> Sure, it's like uh, the anxiety I used to have I used to attach it to all type of things.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Now when I have an attach I say "okay, I know what this is" I'll look down at the watch and listen and a minute it's done.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's like almost like it has different form.  Like sometimes sudden nauseous feeling I'll get.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Like oh, I know what this is, with a rapid heart rate.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you which [INAUDIBLE] of panic.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but it only takes —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It happened last and I can do the whole thing in like a minute —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'll look down at my watch and I'll watch it —
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> And I'll say "okay I know this will be done in a minute."
<b>DR:</b> And that's what they call cognitive behavioral therapy to —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It reminds you this will not go on forever.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no.
<b>DR:</b> Because when the terror first comes on you're afraid —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, this is just going to pull me under.
<b>PT:</b> Fun how people still attach these, that tags to different things like health issues or uh, sanity issues or religious issues or whatever and uh, if only they knew what it is.  Some people still deny it, I did for a while —
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> To so I can't really judge anybody.  I always feel better when I'm here or with the therapist.  It's like —
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> Complete sanity time.
<b>DR:</b> And we all speak the same language.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> I mean when we look back you know we know some of the history and things that have happened and different things that you've tried and now you can look back with some perspective and you've gained some benefits.  Like back when you tried the Paxil 20 mg —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> For anxiety.  I think back then they were recommending 20 mg starting dose.  You're more sensitive to medication when we start —
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> It for depression we want to look at 15 mg.  If you ever need an increase we'll go up by 5, you know we're not going to go up by steps of 10.
<b>PT:</b> Well, we've been trying that for a long time —
<b>DR:</b> Talking to your [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And finally I saw —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Why not try it if it doesn't work —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you can always drop it down.
<b>PT:</b> Drop it back.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah exactly.
<b>PT:</b> So I stayed with it and it was almost like um, okay I need a little more because I'm going through a whole lot more so —
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Be nice to be off of all these things 1 day but it's also nice to know that if I ever do have to you know, go back on it someday in life I'll know what I need.  I remember the first time I tried anything was um, what was the big 1 the first 1?
<b>DR:</b> Prozac?
<b>PT:</b> Oh —
<b>DR:</b> Probably.
<b>PT:</b> That was awful.
<b>DR:</b> And they did use it for anxiety back then too.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I want, it, that stuff was bad to me.
<b>DR:</b> That builds up in your system too.
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Your system doesn't clear it in the course of a day.  It can really kind of add up.
<b>PT:</b> It's a little more primitive, uh, medication isn't it, like —
<b>DR:</b> Has a longer half life.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It did not work.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I tried that before I came to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> So at least I know never to try Prozac again.  Paxil like okay, I don't want to try anything else because this is sort of working so —
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad it's working.
<b>PT:</b> Nothing else much to say, I just hope that uh, everything calms down at home.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like it's heading in that direction.
<b>PT:</b> It is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It was, it was a nightmare dealing with her for a long time.  She'd change in to someone I didn't even know.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes a vast hormonal shift can contribute to that.
<b>PT:</b> Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b> Because you were noticing —
<b>PT:</b> Yep that was what the whole thing was I guess.  Plus all the other uh, things we had to deal with uh, we went back to see my grandmother for the last time 2 years ago and she uh, she felt like she should have been going back there a lot more and she punished herself for a couple of years out of that.  I started to do that and then I realized um, if I drag myself down in to this it's not going to help.
<b>DR:</b> And now with the depression identified and treated you can probably think to yourself "well at least I got there at all."
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Life is short, if there's a lot of distractions at you, you can always come up with an excuse for not visiting someone —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> But you did make it.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> You were involved in her life.  You know and —
<b>PT:</b> For both of us.
<b>DR:</b> Perfect world we could be with our loved ones all the time.  But people have to work and do other things to.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well both of us didn't go back there because of social phobias —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then that kicked off again with her and at that point I decided I was going to uh, destroy this idea of social phobias.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> And it worked.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> I wonder why I held on to them as long as I did even though I disconnected myself from everything.  I still had them.
<b>DR:</b> Huh, maybe it's an ancient preservation instinct you know just to be cautious, not take chances —
<b>PT:</b> I guess so, I guess that's what it is.
<b>DR:</b> But we're all so social beings and so finding that happy medium, you know I think you've been working your way toward that.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  I don't think much —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> About any encounter I have with anybody afterwards like, I don't think was I [INAUDIBLE] too polite, not polite enough, I don't care.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> I can't be worried about that anymore.  So I guess that's about it.
<b>DR:</b> You are on the right track.
<b>PT:</b> I hope so.
<b>DR:</b> Excellent.
<b>PT:</b> Well it's all about reasoning you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I was unreasonable for a long time.
<b>DR:</b> Well something's, sometimes there's nothing rational about that panicky feeling.  It's like a primitive fear instinct and you know you mentioned whether —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Or not maybe someday coming off medication.  For people who are prone to panic and severe anxiety and sometimes recurring depression.  What's really going on is that their body soaks up their stress chemicals Serotonin, right away.  So there's not in the synapse to sustain them through the times.
<b>PT:</b> That I did not know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so the Paxil really helps your body use your own nature stress chemical for longer.  So —
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I had not idea —
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's how that worked.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and it's interesting to think that you know that Serotonin and others too of which are [INAUDIBLE], dopamine to some degree but with Paxil it's primarily the Serotonin, um can impact so many things.  You know social phobia —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> Anxiety, panic, and then depression comes through and being able to use 15 mg Paxil helps to control that.  So —
<b>PT:</b> What happens chemically to a person who lives through a lot of stress then they feel uh, exhausted and wipe out.  What is happens there?
<b>DR:</b> Because Serotonin helps cope with uh, with stresses of all kinds I think that when the body is allowed to use it the way it's intended you know for the period of time —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know it stays in the synapsis of the brain.  It gives a person motivation and energy to keep going to cope —
<b>PT:</b> Okay, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know to kind of pace themselves maybe.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um —
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I think I got it.
<b>DR:</b> And if it gets soaked up too quickly then there's the panic of oh my gosh.  I don't have what I need to get me through.  You know —
<b>PT:</b> Um—hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, and so there is literally something missing but it's just because it absorbed too quickly.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I got it there's a chemical balance there and uh —
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I think I've got that finally.  I can't think of anything else.  I just hope that uh, I hope they give me a job that's not too far away because everything I have is close.  This is close, [NAME OTHER] is close.
<b>DR:</b> And you love to walk?
<b>PT:</b> I do —
<b>DR:</b> If you could walk it'd be fantastic.
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere around [DEIDENTIFIED] or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I walk there about everyday.  So, I don't know, I'm looking forward to being there.  Not looking forward to the time between here and there —
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> But I'm looking forward to once I'm there, once I'm in that dentist chair I sit there "okay big deal what are they going to do."
<b>DR:</b> Good for you, good for you.
<b>PT:</b> I mean how many teeth can you pull, some but, so it wasn't that big a deal.
<b>DR:</b> But yeah some of which was anticipatory anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> It was awful.
<b>DR:</b> Like fear of the unknown.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Once you know what you're doing "okay."
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, fear has no limits, there's no limit to the imagination.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Worried about things for so many years that uh, I don't even realize.  See that's the other thing I've got a grip on to the um, the, the mystery of all this.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I think I've finally got a grip where, I'm not going to have any emotional or anxiety and attach it to anything other than what it is, I hope.
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I've wasted all the years with preoccupations and things that were not real.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think you're seeing things more clearly —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I think so, I think that's what it is, just became reasonable, started listen to therapist, started listening to the doctors.  Whatever they say think "my, my uh, uh, philosophy of the paranoia, the almost uh, I had too much time to think about things on my own.  To much, I still have too much time for this and hopefully like I say "once I'm there at the job, okay that's it, it's easy that'll be easy."
<b>DR:</b> Um—hum.
<b>PT:</b> Being here and moving to there, I still, I'm still, I'm still stalling, I still am.  I told my therapist in the beginning.  I'm going to stall from the beginning here —
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> And you're going to have to keep working on this.  Because once you get me there I said, same as the dentist.  Just go, just go.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Finally go, finally go, fine, just go.  If you get in there and you don't want to go through with it walk out.  So, I went in there and I said "okay this is easier to sit here then it is to think about it."  So, hopefully it'll be like that too.
<b>DR:</b> Good for you, he realized how much was in your control.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, much.
<b>DR:</b> That's excellent, excellent.
<b>PT:</b> Very much.  Well, I guess that's about it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, way to go I'm very, very glad that you know, you nailed down what it was —
<b>PT:</b> Oh well —
<b>DR:</b> And do what you needed to do.
<b>PT:</b> If it wasn't for [NAME OTHER], I'd still be stuck where I was 20 years ago easily.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're the 1 who came.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You got yourself in to the door.  You kept coming —
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Even when someone might have been saying not exactly what you wanted to hear.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah that was it.
