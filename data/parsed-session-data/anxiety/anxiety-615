<b>MOTHER'S DAY IS ONE</b> of those pastel wrist-corsage holidays. In
the kindest scenario, we pack Mom in the Buick and take her to Sunday
buffet. She gets a card with roses and glitter script. We thank
her for her unflinching support all those years as we attempted field
hockey and the autoharp.


But motherhood—at least as I've experienced it—is the kind
of hair-raising experience that calls for a more primal celebration,
perhaps with burning herbs, bread baked in the shape of babies, and
keening. Behind Mom's beatific smile is a nest of emotions, from
purest joy to total heartbreak.


If there is a definitive statement on the heartbreak of parenthood,
it might be <i>Decalogue: One</i>, the first in a series of shorts
directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski. The story is
about a mathematician and his precocious son. The two delight
in science—calculating, predicting, and quantifying—and the boy,
Pawel, wants to know when their neighborhood pond will be fully
frozen for skating. They conclude one morning that the pond is
safe: The ground temperature has been below freezing for many
days. They are unaware that the crew of a nearby power station has
released hot water into the pond overnight.


As mothers, we plan for every exigency. So does Pawel's father.

These thoughts whirled in my head while I was pregnant. I'd
spend night after night lying on the couch, unable to lay to rest
my questions about the little feet that kicked inside me. We were
unsafe at every moment. I wore myself out hammering cabinet
locks into place, researching the dangers of heavy metals in fish,
fretting about the Moscow Mules and Xanax I'd had before I realized
I was going to have a baby. Were routine sonograms dangerous?
Should we vaccinate? Were my outlets overloaded? If my air
bag deployed accidentally, would the force crush the fetus? Was I
oligohydramniotic?


Consequently, I was not a jolly pregnant lady. I did not eat

Other people didn't seem to have this problem. I endured a
horrific childbirth preparation class with expectant couples bubbling
over with glee, talking about their nursery furnishings and gift
showers. Periodically, a husband would liken the childbirth experience
to some form of discomfort he experienced routinely—lifting
weights or dislocating a trick shoulder. We played icebreaker games
and watched <i>Bill Cosby, Himself</i>. I wanted to throw myself out the
window.


I had one moment of happiness during my pregnancy: the day
I found out. I went out into the living room with the test stick and
rifled through our music collection in search of something suitable
for the occasion.


"You're going to like this," I told my stomach. "There are really
beautiful things out here in the world, and this music is one of
them."


I put on Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i>, which is one of my favorite albums.
I sat down on the floor by the speakers and felt around on my abdomen.
I listened very closely until it was over, hearing statements like,
"I wish I'd never seen your face," and "The doctor orders drinks all
night to take away this curse."


It's not <i>Up with People</i>. But it's true and comforting; it says something
real, like <i>Decalogue: One</i>. It mitigated my suffering when I was

Of course, Elliott Smith would be dead from an apparently self-inflicted
stab wound before my son's second birthday.
