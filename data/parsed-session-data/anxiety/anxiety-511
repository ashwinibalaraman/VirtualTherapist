BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	And thank you very much for participating in the study to help promote better communication.
<b>PT:</b>	You're welcome.
<b>DR:</b>	Now you mentioned that you had, uh, gotten tied up earlier today with another appointment.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it wasn't an appointment for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	It was for [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, how did, how did things turn out?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, better than what we anticipated.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Is that your telephone?  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b>	Um, so anyways, recently they diagnosed with, um, [INAUDIBLE] cancer and it's, uh, now in the liver.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and she was [INAUDIBLE] today.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um—
<b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you could go with her.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  So anyways I accompanied her and she had her first treatment today.
<b>DR:</b>	Was it a chemotherapy or radiation treatment?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm not really sure.  It might not have been either because it's an injection just to, um, just to keep the cancer, um, spreading.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] of the liver.
<b>DR:</b>	So it is a kind of a chemotherapy in a sense that—
<b>PT:</b>	Sure, right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, it's probably a chemical that they injected.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not sure, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	God bless her.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well I'm glad you were there for moral support.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] learned a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	We just got a little anxious about, you know, when I found out that I wasn't going to be on time for my appointment.  So thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's okay.  Somebody cancelled at 4:30, so and that was just this morning.  So I'm glad we had the opportunity to meet.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So how have you been holding up with all this going on?
<b>PT:</b>	When I initially found out about her diagnosis, um, I thought that I would be fine, um.  I was not really tearful, but heartbroken.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, after about 2 days, you know, I could sense that I was going to have a bout.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, a bout with the depression.
<b>PT:</b>	The depression, right.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I did.  It wasn't severe, but it was enough that I didn't get in contact with her for that day and—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I stayed in bed maybe perhaps three fourths of the day.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, then I, I, you know, I cried and then we agreed to have some social outings, a couple of social outings.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	So that helped both of us.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	So it's, it's, it's been different.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so she, she also, uh, had to be, um, I think her doctor put her on some sort of sedative.  I don't know the exact name of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because she was suffering with, uh, anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So she said to me, boy now I know what you're going through, and she actually had to, uh, stop working because of the anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, she would have not been able to function, and she's, she's, you know, in the financial, um, world, so she, you know, worked with stocks and bonds.  She had to make, um, you know, some decisions.  They said that she didn't feel well, that she was able to do that.  So we more of less became bonded a little bit because of that.
<b>DR:</b>	And a greater understanding.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Of my—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, because she was the type, oh, you know, just come over and go and do this.  You'll feel better.  It's not that easy.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And you probably know that a lot of the people who end up in emergency rooms thinking they're having a heart attack are really in the throws of a panic attack.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And people literally feel like they're going to die—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Just drop dead right there.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  I used to have numerous, I mean at least once a, a week, I mean severe panic attacks.  I was in and out of [DEIDENTIFIED] emergency room.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And it wasn't until I was treated here.  I don't know which of the medicines worked, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Something helped.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Or the therapy or something.
<b>DR:</b>	Or a combination.
<b>PT:</b>	I have, I have, I still have anxiety attacks, but they're nowhere near what they used to be.
<b>DR:</b>	And, you know, that on top of the depression and the mood swings.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean it's just a roller coaster.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Everything that you're taking actually helps with that.  The Effexor XR, the Klonopin and the Risperdal.  Then can all help with being able to, um, help your mood get more on an even keel and helping to take the edge off that panic attack building up.
<b>DR:</b>	And your hunch when you thought that the Wellbutrin wasn't sitting well with you.  Sometimes Wellbutrin, for some people, can be kind of activating, and sometimes that feeling is similar enough to panic that people are really uncomfortable with it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you know, I remember that you really felt that that just wasn't enhancing the regime and so that's when we talked and—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And you started to slowly take yourself down off of that.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  I, I was a little confused, um, after our last meeting.  I didn't pay, when I started to pay attention to what you were saying, but am I off of the Wellbutrin now because I've continued the half tablet?
<b>DR:</b>	I know that you had talked about maybe taking half a tablet of what was left—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's right.
<b>DR:</b>	Until it was gone.
<b>PT:</b>	Until it was gone, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But if you're in a situation where you feel ready to stop.  You know, you've certainly been tapering, you know, staying at that dose for, you know, almost a month now.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you know, it's up to you.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	It's up to you.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have the tremors as much as I did.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Before that was a big thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I was really afraid.  I thought something was more, you know, physical.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But—
<b>DR:</b>	It probably was a side effect.
<b>PT:</b>	And one other thing I discovered.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	We talked about taking more of the Klonopin—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	During the day.
<b>DR:</b>	When you started to feel those panicky feelings.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Well, I took one half, no, initially I took the 1 tablet.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And then I took a half and then another half.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, I had no energy—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	At all.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I didn't know what to do.  Actually I should have called you, and then, so I said all right, let's try something and then I, um, took one half—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	At night and then that morning I didn't take any.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I thought maybe it was sedating me too much or I don't know—
<b>DR:</b>	It's possible.
<b>PT:</b>	If it was a tremor.  I didn't have any energy.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So after I took one half at night, I was able to get up in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Which was a lot better and then I took, um, that another half in the evening.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	I took an additional if I felt kind of edgy.
<b>DR:</b>	Perfect.  That's the best way to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  I, I wondered if that was okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Makes a lot of sense.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And lessening the Wellbutrin the way you did, you may not have been feeling as much of the need for the Klonopin to offset that edgy feeling.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good that you can listen to your moods and, and feel your anxiety level and work with it that way.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's the ideal thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Because you know, I'm really fearful becoming, um, addicted to, you explained all the pros and cons—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I'm still nervous about, you know, that happening to me because my sister, what she went through.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And it's only, it wasn't like, um, I mean she was sick and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She just needed help and she kept taking more and more, you know, and I'm just so afraid.  She was hospitalized for a little over two weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And weaned, whatever they do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, that was the lorazepam, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, lorazepam, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Now you have the benefit of the Effexor and the Risperdal in place and those are, are very good.  Effexor helps with panic and depression.  Risperdal can help with those things and mood stability.  So, right now it sounds like you're using the Klonopin to enhance that, and you're very insightful about when you might need a little more, and when you can manage with a little less.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And that's great.  I mean, um, the fact that you're coming and taking less than we discussed is a good sign.  I'm not worried about you getting addicted to it.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, obviously we'll keep our radar up, but, um, at one point, it actually sounds like it might have been counteracting some side effects of the Wellbutrin, and overall things seem to be a little better.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, with the Wellbutrin almost gone, and you know, less medicine altogether.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Hopefully—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Things will work out.
<b>DR:</b>	[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] would be proud of you.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	You're so conscientious.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  We used to have arguments.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you?
<b>PT:</b>	About medication because he doesn't really, um, approve of my own personal experimenting with medication.
<b>DR:</b>	Well it doesn't sound as much like you're experimenting as when there's a situation with mood swings involved or a waxing and waning of mood symptoms, sometimes you need to be in a situation and be able to fine tune.  At certain times of year, people experience the symptoms more acutely and it's often in the spring and the fall.  There seems to be something about the time change, the change in length of days where things might seem more off kilter and that's a time where someone might take a little more Risperdal, a little more Klonopin to try to balance things out.  Um, but I think it's a fact of life and you're a very insightful person.  You're very in tune with how you're feeling.  You're excellent at expressing it and you're the expert on how you're feeling, and, um, you know, there are some people who they can take a certain dose of medicine for years and that's what they need and they don't need to vary it at all, but when there's a situation of ups and downs with mood and panic attacks increasing or decreasing in frequency, I think you need to be able to, to modify.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I really do.  So, you're showing good sense as far as I'm concerned so far.
<b>PT:</b>	Well the big trial is next week.  My daughter's moving out.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I'll be alone.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  What do you think?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I have mixed emotions.  Um, the house will be tidy.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But I'll miss the babies.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, my other grandson [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	How far are they moving?
<b>PT:</b>	Not far.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, not too far.
<b>DR:</b>	It will be an adjustment, you know, which will have its pluses and minuses definitely, privacy, noise level better and you can always invite them over, but now it's on your terms.  You decide when's a good time to visit or not.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, as opposed to having everything taken over.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I know at one point you were living with your girlfriend to try to get some—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, peace and quiet and—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  So that's about it.  I do have one concern.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	My memory.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Now I know at one time, I was told by a neurologist that my memory impairment might be, or was probably due to my panic attacks or anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But I don't know, it, it's, it's just, it's frustrating.  My recalling words.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, events, things that have happened, and it's starting trouble me and I don't know.  I don't know if that's related to anxiety, but I don't know whether I discuss that with you or my primary.
<b>DR:</b>	We're all in it together.  I think the whole medical team is a team together on this, and interestingly, all of the medicines that you're taking can affect memory.  So that's a tricky situation, balancing the advantages and the potential disadvantages.
<b>PT:</b>	So how am I to determine whether it's, it's, um, a result of the medication or some other, you know, mental, not mental, but, um, dementia.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	That, that, that's what I'm afraid of.
<b>DR:</b>	There are a couple different things that, that we can do.  Um, one, you're almost done tapering off the Wellbutrin.  You could go ahead and stop the Wellbutrin now.  In and of itself, memory may start to improve.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Each of the other medicines that you're taking also can affect memory in different ways.  When it's a situation of difficulty recalling words specifically or finding the right word, I tend to hear that report most often from people taking Effexor or medicines like Effexor.  Um, so if you have an opportunity to think back when if there were a time where it suddenly became more prominent, um, where you just thought I remember the first time I ever noticed, you know, I had trouble recalling the right words was, you know, back when I first started taking Effexor and it hasn't gotten better since, you know, that would tell us a lot.  Um, on the other hand, um, both, um, Risperdal and Klonopin can be related to difficulties with memory.  Um, and again there are alternatives to those.  You know, we could look at the dosing.  Another thing that we can do is at each of our visits, um, I can, uh, do a mini mental status exam which essentially is like a, um, uh, test of your memory every couple or few months, you know, just in case there are some subtle changes.  Another thing we could consider is a more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.  Some insurances do pay for that.  Um, sometimes what a neurologist might do if they think they have been at risk for a stroke or something like that, they might get a, a CT scan of your brain.  Sometimes strokes leave little changes behind that can be detected.  So there are a lot of different things that could be implicated.  Um, I think simplifying the medication regime.  You know, you're almost done with the first step of phasing out the Wellbutrin.  You've also already reduced the Klonopin some.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe the Risperdal.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And the Risperdal [INAUDIBLE] did start that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	When you started, um, did you notice any difference in your memory at that point that you can recall?
<b>PT:</b>	No, because I was having memory problems before and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	By my primary physician.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And their summary, their final summary.  They, um, said that they thought it may be depression anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I was really appalled that they said that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, then they recommended I see a psychiatrist.
<b>DR:</b>	So this was even back before taking the Effexor or anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum, but that's another pattern, really severe panic attacks.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Really severe.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I would have to get in the hot shower, you know, for my heart to stop palpating, you know, just [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And when a person is in a really high state of fear, they do tend to forget everything but living in that moment.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	For sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, yeah, it could all be wrapped up together, you know.  Some of it side effects of medicine.  You know, some of it an aging process.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my father, and I guess that's why I'm really being cautious, he, um, in his late [AGE] I believe, was diagnosed with, um, is there such a thing as cognitive something, um, but a dementia was also mentioned.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't remember the exact terms.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes they'll start off calling it something like mild cognitive impairment.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	They'll follow it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  And then eventually he was diagnosed with dementia.
<b>DR:</b>	He was?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Did he ever take anything for that?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  He was in the VA hospital.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, and when he passed away, um, I didn't know what the, um, cause of death.  He was living with, my parents were separated, I mean divorced for years.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And his, uh, second set of children actually cared for him and they were never sure of that information, the cause of his death.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But I just knew from my aunt and uncle that he [INAUDIBLE].  He also had mental problems.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He suffered from depression and anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	How old was he when he died?
<b>PT:</b>	I think it was late, late [AGE] or [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	He was pretty young.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	And he was a veteran?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Korean war or Vietnam?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  In the, um—
<b>DR:</b>	World War II?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	God bless him.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but he was [AGE].  He was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He was really young.  So that's why I'm concerned.
<b>DR:</b>	Well sure, that's a good reason to be concerned.  Have you ever thought about, um, taking any of the medicines that have to do with dementia—
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Or early dementia?  Would you like to take some information with you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But do you think I should be the one to determine whether or not it's, it's dementia or if it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Early on, the changes can be pretty subtle.  Um, the fact that there's a family history makes me think that's definitely worth looking into.  Most of the treatments that exist right now have to do with slowing down the progression of it, you know, once it's suspected that it exists.  And with mild cases, it's a little bit tricky because sometimes people wait quite a while thinking well, it could be one thing.  It could be another.  It could be related to, um, depression or anxiety or panic, you know, like the neurologist said, and yet if, you know, during the time you were working with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and different medication trials and so forth, if you finding, well that medicine didn't seem to affect the forgetting particularly.  It did impact some other symptoms like one would think if, if the forgetting had been associated with panic and depression, that once those things are getting some treatment, you know, your memory might be getting better, and it sounds like you haven't necessarily been experiencing that.  Some other things have been better like the tremors improved on less Wellbutrin and so forth, but, um, if you'd like, I can give you some information to read, um, and I can collect some more information as well about, I can look at what you'd have done and see if there's more testing that needs to be done.  The good news is that, um, the current medicines that are available generally are pretty low in side effects.  Um, I like the preventative aspects of them.  Um, there are several options, so if one doesn't sit particularly well, you know, there are others to consider, um, and I, you know, I tend to be prevention oriented, and, uh, the fact that someone in your family went through it, it's definitely worth keeping in the forefront of what we're thinking about, you know.  Let me gave some information together for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Would, would a neurologist be the one to, to make that diagnosis?
<b>DR:</b>	What they could probably diagnose is, this is another tricky, uh, situation with dementia.  With Alzheimer's there isn't really any one thing that can be found on a CT scan or, um, any other kind of test that proves for sure that someone has it.  The only thing that be proven for sure is a biopsy and the biopsy of your brain would happen after you left this world, so.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Some people do get that for confirmation of the diagnosis eventually.  On the other hand, if there were what's called a vascular dementia, in other words, like mini strokes, that can leave, um, some little calcium deposits in the brain which could be seen on, on a head CT scan.  Originally, uh, most of the, uh, medications were studied in Alzheimer's, but increasingly research is showing they help with all kinds of dementia, including vascular.  So if, if you had say a CT scan done and there were signs of old tiny strokes, well that could be a contributing factor.  Um, and medication could help.  Um, sometimes as a person gets older, you're still pretty young, but as a person gets older, um, sometimes we look to use things like Risperdal less and less because for some older folks who are prone to that kind of a problem sometimes thought Risperdal could aggravate it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So, you know, there are a variety of modifications that we could make as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, so but one thing that really helps is just to know more about the condition.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, some of the signs and symptoms to look for, and you're especially proactive.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But more often happens is the person themselves may not recognize it, but a family member might say well gosh, they're losing their keys all the time.  They're getting lost when they're driving.  They don't know where they are, you know, they're forgetting familiar people and names and faces, you know, um, but it sounds to me like you're pretty attuned to this even early on if there are some early signs.  So you do have some time to work with—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, but at the same time, I'd take it very seriously.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And the good news is now we have some medicines that prevent it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That can help to prevent.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The way that, um, some of the ones that they're using for early on seem to be working are that, um, apparently what can happen is with Alzheimer's, there can be a genetic, uh, situation where, um, the, uh, brain cells, the neurons that have to do with, um, memory, uh, sometimes they will produce certain proteins and then there's a part of the gene that says all right, that's enough to produce, here's the off switch.  In some people with a genetic condition of Alzheimer's, that off switch doesn't turn off anymore.  So, longer proteins are produced than were originally planned to be stored in the brain and that's where, you know, if you've ever heard the expression "plants and tangles", you know, that can build up in somebody's brain, that's what happens.  What the medicines seem to be able to do is to remind the genetic system you have an off switch, you know, after a certain period of time, you know, you don't keep producing those proteins.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So it cuts down on the tangles.  It's almost like weed killer for your brain.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, there's a, a little bit of weeds are expectable—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But not a big buildup of them.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's really interesting—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	What they're finding out about it, and they're even working on some new ones now.  There's another kind of medication that works a different way for someone who's thought to be in the middle stages or later stages and they're coming out with even more, and some evidence shows that there is 2 that can work together and, and really give some, some relief and slow down the progression.  So it's encouraging to know that this is getting to be a priority.  Um, so I think I've got some information here.  You know, I can send it home with you and—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Let you look it over at your leisure.  Let me see what's what.  This is for a little bit further along.  All right.
<b>PT:</b>	Well shouldn't I just look it up on the internet?
<b>DR:</b>	You could.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, you could.  I don't know if this might be helpful.  It's, um, actually for people working with people who have Alzheimer's.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But, um, I don't know if there might be, if it might remind you about certain things having to do with it.  That could be a possibility.  There's also some information I have that goes with some of the specific medications which might be helpful to look at.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, you've mentioned a couple of times mood swings and I didn't know I was dealing with mood swings.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I think that sometimes, um, I guess would be the, the contrast between the times that you feel like you just don't even want to get out of bed—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Versus maybe the times that you feel very drugged up, you know, even panicky, worried, can't sleep, you know, mind going, you know.  I think the depression has been more prominent—
<b>PT:</b>	The mornings are horrible.
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like.  Yeah, exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I have to work so hard every single day just to get out of bed and get to go to the front door.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	It takes me probably half of a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm usually not out the door before 2:00, most often 4:00 or 5:00.  A friend of mine asked me if, um, I mentioned to my psychiatrist the possibility of having a phobia, but I don't think it's a phobia because that's, that once I'm out the door that first time I'm okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Subsequent, subsequent going in and out.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	But that first time going out in the morning is so hard and if I get up early, you know, I try hard to stay up, but I feel as though, you know, what am I, what am I going to stay up for when there are things that I should be doing, but I don't, I just don't feel that they're important.  I'm not motivated.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But as the day progresses and in the evening, that's when I get my surge of energy and then I'm up most of the night.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, I just take one day at a time.
<b>DR:</b>	We can certainly look at trying to get the treatment, you know, to regulate your days even better.  You know, be awake during the daylight and, you know, sleeping, uh, you know, more at nighttime.  Now that you'd described that energy surge, that is helpful to hear about.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't know if it's energy surge.  Maybe it's, maybe I'm using the wrong term.  I think it's, I'm more at ease.  I'm not as anxious.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I get confused myself about that.
<b>DR:</b>	Here's some information that I think could be helpful.  This is about different aspects, forgetfulness isn't just a sign of aging.  Find out if it's a sign of Alzheimer's, understanding and living with Alzheimer's disease, guide to treatment and help.  That will probably point you towards some web sites, uh, questions to ask about it.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think it would be helpful to have a, a notebook to keep track of appointments and daily planning and that kind of thing?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah because again—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm really horrible.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I, I have to make to do lists and if I don't have that to do list I don't have a clue what I'm supposed to do on a given day.  That's, even making simple phone calls.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	I have to, um, you know, call this person, do this and it can't be overwhelming.  You know, I'm dealing with two things, the memory and then not allowing my to do list, you know, be overwhelming.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Exactly, and, um, this also has some, has a pocket in the back for information and places you can plot your, um, your appointments.  It does have some resources as well with web sites, 800 numbers.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I'm going to give you a little bit more information.  That doesn't seem too overwhelming so far.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Why do you have this if you're a psychiatrist?
<b>DR:</b>	Because actually psychiatrists deal with this a lot.  It's, um, there's a lot of overlap between psychiatry and neurology.  Um, often because—
<b>PT:</b>	It's frightening me.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, actually we need to get trained in both.  Um, as a matter of fact, our, our board certification exam has to do with both and I actually think it's a good thing.  The more that doctors from a couple of different specialties and your primary doctor are knowledgeable, you know, giving information, looking for signs, um, I think we'll be able to help more people by essentially trying to head it off at the pass and you're so good at expressing yourself and very proactive.
<b>PT:</b>	Is that medication?
<b>DR:</b>	This is medication, but I'm going to steal the booklet out of it.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I don't want it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm going to steal the booklet out of it.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I have enough.
<b>DR:</b>	Because it's a sample pack.  I'll show you the sample pack, but I'll detach the sample pack.  This is one of the medicines that's often used early on, um, for mild cases.  It's called Aricept and this explains again just a little bit more.  It's different wording, Alzheimer's symptoms and maybe you'll see some things.  Like it shows during the mild stage, people on 2 or 4 years or longer, some of the common signs.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	During moderate some other things.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So it just, it helps to see, you know, what are doctors thinking about when they ask you about it.  Maybe it'll jog your memory about something that you want to bring up our next visit.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, if you did decide, uh, to start, there is a starter pack that's like all the first 5 weeks or so, but you don't have to rush into anything.  You know, this is just the preliminary stages gathering information.  You're asking the right questions.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you know, some of it I think may be medication related.  You're simplifying your regime already.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I think the outlook's very good.  I really do.
<b>PT:</b>	This is, this medication, it doesn't improve the memory.  It just prevents your condition from worsening.
<b>DR:</b>	What the studies originally showed was preventing the condition from worsening.  What experts that I've heard speak and show their research and so forth, they often show improvement.  So there may even be things at work with the medication we're not 100% sure about, but generally it appears there's improvement actually.
<b>PT:</b>	Now are there any physical, um, changes that you feel, for instance, again, maybe 2 or 3, maybe at least 2 times, um, a week, I become very fearful.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, I don't know where this feeling is coming from.  It's a physical thing that I feel.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's really, you know, I feel so afraid and I feel like wrapping something around myself or protecting myself and I was wondering if that has anything to do with the, the memory.  You know, if you have an impaired memory, are there any physical symptoms that—
<b>DR:</b>	There can be.
<b>PT:</b>	Associated with that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Does it feel different from the panic?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think that it can be, um, because sometimes, uh, people are, you know, more fearful about going outside.  They might not trust their environment as much.  You know, like when you mention wrapping something around yourself, you know, just being safe at home, putting your shawl around yourself.  Um, I think that's a natural when people are feeling like they, they're not sure what they'll encounter outside or, you know, they might, uh, just be a little bit more fearful.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  And one last thing, I went, I go to a bible class and I started a new, um, class and I was asked this last week to end a session in prayer and I was so upset.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, because I, I told the instructor that, you know, because of thoughts don't, they don't come to my mind.  Words don't come—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	At times, and I can't even think of what to pray about, but she said that it was, if I had faith and if I, I don't know, I just feel as though my spirituality wasn't where it should be and I said to her, I said well, I don't, I don't really want to, want to pray and she said well I hope you overcome that.  That's really a fear.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm.  I think she probably put you on the spot, you know.  Um, one option you could have it to say let's pray in silence or, you know, let's all pray in our own way in silence.  You're kind of put on the spot if you're supposed to come up with words for the entire group, and I think she should have asked you about it beforehand.
<b>PT:</b>	And mostly her group had no problem.  They could just come out with thoughts, you know, just like they're having a conversation.  When I, when I was asked, it was like I shut down.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I couldn't think of what to say, simple words weren't coming.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, is that anxiety or is that memory?
<b>DR:</b>	That is a little bit more anxiety I think, like social anxiety, like, you know, you went expecting certain things from the meeting and all of a sudden the rules change and you're in the spotlight.  I think she was putting you in the spotlight unnecessarily.  Now granted—
<b>PT:</b>	But she don't know what's my condition.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's okay, you know, depending on what you want to share, you can just say, um, it's always been a challenge for me to speak in groups.  I'm more someone who likes to pray silently.  I hope you don't mind if I don't lead the group in prayer.  Um, in the future, you know, I, you know, I think silent prayer is very helpful or if someone else is leading a prayer, that's fine with me, but I'm not the type to be leading a group at this point.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you can share whatever you want to share, but in no way do I think it undermines your spirituality at all, and as you know, some religions, the Monks take a vow of silence, and that's an enormous self discipline for them not to speak and to dedicate their interior life to meditation and religion.  Um, so—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh no.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Not at all.  No, faith is a, you know, very individual thing and, you know, I don't think that God is just about speech, you know.  If you think of the Quaker faith, an entire Quaker meeting can be silent and unless someone really feels moved to say something, you know, [INAUDIBLE] which is coming from divine inspiration, they're not going to speak and nobody thinks that's strange or not strange.  The only thing they would think is strange is if someone is made to speak or feels they have to speak when they don't actually feel moved.  So there's a whole religion dedicated to, to that school of thought.  I think it's hard to be put on the spot, I really do.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  That's it.
<b>DR:</b>	All righty.
<b>PT:</b>	So, um, I have to pay you.
<b>DR:</b>	No, actually I owe you money.  Did you know that?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You were ahead with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	They sent me a check.  They gave me—
<b>DR:</b>	Did they?
<b>PT:</b>	They sent me a check.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, well they gave me cash to give you too.  So I'll show you.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] what they're doing.
<b>DR:</b>	Hold on.  I'll turn this off and we'll try to go through the, uh, finances.
