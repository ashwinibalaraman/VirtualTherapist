TERROR ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS


Days preceding the regular Tuesday-Thursday mass shock treatments
occasioned a fifteen-minute visitation by the ward Dr. in charge.
This was a matter of making up the shock list for the following day.
Behind the closed office door, the head nurse conferred with the Dr.
who had no first hand knowledge or observation whatever of the patients
in question except perhaps a brief admitting interview, typically very
brief -- five minutes or so. It was for the head nurse to nominate those
who for some reason were to be put on, continued on or taken off the
list. This formality gave a pseudo-medical-expert character to the procedure.
"The Dr. is the only one who makes the lists." That was always
the modest answer with which the head nurse dodged queries by painfully
anxious recipients as to what their status re: the coming ordeal of
treatment day would be.


For those who have little notion of what it's like to take electric
shock, I am asking to regard it from this angle -- the angle of lying
horizontally on a gurney <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_1346');">[note]</a><div id="_note_1346" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗A gurney is a thing on wheels -- used in surgical cases. Patients laid out prone
on it -- high -- smooth gliding.</div> twice a week for two years for "treatment"
by a vertically-oriented technician with an M.D. degree, an insensitivity
to human rights, and a tendency to be stupid or sadistic or both.


Except for the minority who yelled, kicked, and screamed, most
of us suffered inwardly in the realization that we had no defense, and
that resistance would be sure to get us a stronger treatment. A news
photographer could take a picture of shock treatment morning on our
ward, and everything would look calm. But from the subjective angle
(i.e. horizontal angle), it looks like an Alfred Hitchcock movie where
some horror is present invisibly while ordinary visible things move along
normally. It just might seem a little odd if the newsman stayed on the
job for a two-hour period of pictures of the same people queuing up
about every fifteen minutes to go to the toilet. No sooner would this be

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00006&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

People are apt to dismiss the above by saying, "But you can't feel
anything when the shock treatment is given." To those, I would ask
that they imagine the hours of anticipation from 5:30 A.M. when a
nurse snaps on the light and calls the getting-up order ... "O.K. ladies,
strip your beds ... treatment day." Usually no one moves for a minute
or two. These last minutes of warmth become precious. Then we get
up, strip our beds and head for the lavatory where smoking is allowed.
It was forbidden elsewhere in the ward. We huddled in groups or
paced around solitarily trying to think of nothing but the lighting and
smoking of cigarettes. Words were inadequate. But giving or borrowing
a cigarette and getting a light from a sympathetic fellow-sufferer seemed
momentous. A kind of sympathetic reality. I never smoked much before,
and when I did, I always wondered why. On shock treatment day, smoking
had an amazing importance. After an hour or so of this waiting
and smoking, a nurse stationed herself in a usual spot and proceeded
to read off the list of names -- usually about eighty or so from our
ward, which was supplemented at actual treatment time by small
groups from other wards, making well over a hundred people. As the
names were read in alphabetical order, my heart pounded quite heavily
and as my name invariably came, it had a sound like eternal doom or
damnation. I was "on" ... as usual. Hope was frustrated. After receiving
this summons, one was expected to gather in a special dormitory,
this time without cigarettes until the "Doctor came". Doctor came about
8:30, her high heels clicking down the corridor. These three hours had
seemed like three days. The rest of the ward, the lucky ones who were
"off" went to breakfast and then one could hear their return ... their
television program ... their moving about. During the two hour waiting
period in the dorm, there was this constant bladder emptying, in varying
degrees of severity. I was waiting in the line most of the time. A most
terrible loss of body fluids, hormones etc. under this terrible stress.
I mention this because people tend to underrate the physical damage
of anticipating shock. At any rate, they think of it as purely a mental
fear. This is so false. The truth is that electric shock is physical torture
of an extreme type. How to describe this sensation ... especially when
most people don't want it described. They want to change the subject.
The word "physical" is where people don't follow you. They think you
mean some kind of abstract psychological fear. Some mental fear and
pain. This fear is intensely physical. It proves the case against mind-body
dualism. The heart and solar plexus churn and give off waves of
... I don't know the word for it. It hasn't the remotest resemblance

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00007&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My turn came toward the end as my name starts with one of the
toward-the-end-of-the-alphabet letters. Four and five at a time, we approached
that many chairs as they were vacated by our predecessors.
The corridor was long and the floor highly polished with wax. The
attendants until this time had been acting sympathetic but now business
was business and their demeanor was a no-nonsense inhuman efficiency.
There was something about that polished corridor that added to the
terror and sensation of being de-humanized! One felt overwhelmed by
its gloss and brilliance. It seemed important. You not. We walked in
our stocking feet as shoes would get in their way, though they did
have some quaint little things called bootlets (flannel). I had the sensation
while approaching the chairs that I would fall. And if I did, I
would break and shatter. The gloss seemed to symbolize a hostile power;
a slippery unsure place to die. During this short long wait we observed
the following: There were three gurneys employed. On one gurney
a patient was rolled into the open door backwards. Another carried the
unconscious body of the previous patient down the corridor to the
"recovery room". Four "gurney girls" push each gurney. They were
trained to run. Walking would not have been economical with gurneys.
It was necessary to unload the patient in the recovery dorm then, still
running, to return the gurney to the loading point. The gurney girls
were patients. The loading in the corridor near the open door was supervised
by attendants. (Patients assisted the Dr. in giving treatments, i.e.
holding down the convulsing body. This takes about six people.) Loading,
they stand you on a stool, so that when the gurney girls arrive
with an empty gurney, you can mount it quickly. The thing is timed
down to split seconds. This is another factor which seems to reduce
you to utter insignificance. You are just a part on an assembly line, and
not the important part. Saving the Dr.'s time seems the only thing that
matters. So you are now horizontal and ready for the smooth glide backwards
through the open door. Your name is called ... so the Dr. will
know who you are, and how much you get. From the first moment
of the horizontal, I closed by eyes, so as to avoid seeing anyone of the
helpers or the set-up or the Dr. Besides, it's mostly behind. Your glide
into the treatment room is backwards ... not facing the apparatus.
So I've never seen the "little black box" except in ads in journals of the
trade. It was necessary at this time for me to detach my feelings from
the realities. Some behaved differently. According to reports, some of

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00008&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The scene in the ‘recovery’ dorm was the following: There was a
canvas lifter with straps put under the patient at time of loading before
treatment. After treatment, in the ‘recovery’ dorm, the gurney girls lifted
the patient with this contraption and dumped them onto a bed. Dumped
them like sacks of potatoes. Four lifters to equalize and speed the
process, so the gurney girls could run back with their unloaded gurney,
for another load. Then a nurse would push the bed containing latest
arrival (they arrived every two or three minutes) close up against the
next bed. By having no space between the beds, the patients could
thrash around when they started "coming to" (their coma lasted about
half an hour) without falling off onto the floor. A patient who was
recovered enough to walk but not yet conscious was supported by two
recovery room helpers, and steered back into the ward. For a while,
you don't know the score. Then you are served coffee and doughnut,
and the realization comes over you that, "Thank God, it is over"! There
is a bad headache and fatigue all day, but this is unimportant. You are
glad the treatment is finished. Sufficient unto that day is the evil
thereof. You go have another cigarette. Memory returns partially. Most
of the details of my past life never did.


NOTES ON WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE
(MENTAL CODE, STATE OF CALIF)


Page 281 Section 5040 ... Definitions of mental illness vague.


Page 284 Section 5050 ... Provides that a person may be restrained
and treated <i>prior</i> to hearing.


Section 5050.1 Form of Order for detention contains two paragraphs
marked with asterisks ... on "non-applicable" paragraph may be struck
out. In the first paragraph, the person receives notice of examination and
is allowed to remain in freedom until this time. In the other, he may
be restrained and treated pending examination and hearing.


Page 288 ... paragraph 2 ... "If ... a relative or friend, counsel
or representative desires to be heard by the court, he must within four

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00009&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I read on 5050.6 "Dispensing with service", the previous scanty
rights of the allegedly mentally ill person <i>may be set aside</i> if medical
examiners say under oath that it would be "detrimental to service notice".
That's all they have to say. Not why. No particulars. There is thus no
record left of circumstances surrounding the allegedly mentally ill
person's alleged illness. Also no record of particulars of so-called medical
examination itself.


Thus absolute power is vested in ability and integrity of medical
examiners who practice a dubious and unproven science at the very
best. 5050.6 "Dispensing with service" does away with all rights, previously
enumerated at such length. Does away with them in a few
sentences.


This paragraph is the only significant part of the entire long enumeration
of various rights because it negates all these, in just three lines.
What is the good of "rights" that can be negated in the final analysis?
This paragraph explains the "real politics" of I don't know how many
people being put away for I don't know how many years without even
token hearings.


Page 291 5054 "The allegedly mentall ill person shall be present at
the hearing, and if he has no attorney, the judge may appoint an attorney.
This is, of course provided that the allegedly mentally ill person
gets as far as filing his petition for a hearing. This is the #1 stumbling
block placed between the allegedly mentally ill person and justice.
This unlikelihood of his having the virtuosity of knowhow and the
cooperation of the parties already detaining and treating him is tremendous
... so that his "rights of a hearing" have been legally negated.
Section 5050.6. There are in practice few, very few hearings ... and
a look at the codes tells why.


Good News 5100.5 I could (had I but known) had any physician make
recommendations to the court ... after commitment. Right to rehear
case. The very thing I had in mind in my fantasies under four years
supervision (three of hospitalization, two of brutal electric shock) "Get
me a lawyer" is often a sort of theme song for our few remaining rebels
in our institutions. Most of the patients are cynical and intimidated and
sophisticated. They play the two-faced double-talk game of acceptance

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Of course, interesting a physician in my behalf for such an action
would have been an even more formidable task than getting a lawyer.
Few Drs. want to contradict a State hospital in court. Besides on re-reading
of "Further Orders After Commitment", it doesn't sound like
such good news after all because it is so vaguely worded I'm not sure
it means what it says, or says what it means. (Bottom of page 296 and
first paragraph of page 297) You read it, reader. Is there a real Santa
Claus?


Page 298 5125 JURY TRIAL. This right also is subject to patient's having
been successful in filing a request for hearing in the first place; and
of being in possession of knowledge of his rights and of his faculties,
which under permission granted to detainers might easily be interfered
with by his detainers ... injections, electric shocks, etc. This demand
must be made within ten days. The section does not say in what form
this demand must appear ... whether an attorney or someone outside
must file a request petition. Meanwhile the person is being held incommunicado
and hospital personnel turn a deaf ear to all "demands".
Secure in the knowledge that the patient's "rights" may be disregarded
if they see fit (for the good of the patient, of course) which means
head nurses on wards. Drs. in state hospitals see little or nothing of
patients, being busy with paper work, relying on nurses to tell them
who's who and what's what. Purely figure heads to give a quasi legitimate
color to the whole dark world inhabited by the white uniforms.
These white robed head nurses of our land have powers (real) which
neither our Supreme Court judges or any other judges or officials including
the man in the White House possess. Others have only formal
powers. The real judges in purple robes.


Page 301 ... I fail to grasp meaning of first paragraph. Legal disability
can easily be suffered by the very privileges granted under 5050.6
namely the "dispensing with service".


Page 301 5056 "No person may be committed who is being treated
by prayer by a well-recognized church, sect. etc. unless the person is
deemed dangerous to himself or others." Well, this gives some lee way
to those who can establish that this is being done. What religious group
other than Christian Science practitioners actually can be said to "treat
people by prayer"? Many outfits might be willing to pray for people
but how many assume the responsibility of "treatment by prayer" other
than the Science practitioners? Besides, I personally know of no "well
recognized religious organization" with whom I could honestly and
genuinely be closely affiliated with. The Unitarians, I suppose, would
be my best bet, because they have no set dogmas. They recognize individual

The space devoted to enumerating the "rights" of the allegedly
mentally ill person is considerable. The space devoted to cancelling these
same enumerated rights is brief. Anyone with any knowledge of realities
knows which prevails ... the rights or the cancellation of them.
His rights are not his. I found out about my commitment months after it
took place.


THE MOVEMENT <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19840');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19840" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Reprinted by Courtesy of <i>The Provincetown Review</i>.</div>


To understand the present Mental Health propaganda, it is wise to
look both backwards and forwards. Looking backwards, we see a
gradual population explosion of "mentally ill". This has now become
such a huge category, and the prospects of its expansion are so astronomical,
that the idea of accommodating these unfortunate creatures
in their former forced labor concentration camps terrorized by electric
shock has become impracticable.


Also, public indignation is catching up ... evidence has grown that
their cruel methods were ineffectual. Attention must be diverted into
new, unknown and unknowable ways. The "New Look" must look
different.


Tranquilizers are the transition stage to hospitalless society. Terror
has been removed from the foreground to the background. Electric shock
and other terror devices can be administered outside as well, so do not
imagine that with the going of the big detention and torture places, that
the torture chambers are going too. There'll be a torture chamber as
near as your Community Psychiatric clinic, or even your own home. If
the laws of our land grant discretionary powers to psychiatrists to do

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus the ugliest part of the picture of the past two decades -- the
torture -- is not to be eliminated, under the new dispensation. It is to
be reserved for that stubborn minority who refuses mind-conditioning
in its myriad disguises, most of them sugar coated and more apt to be
accepted than rejected.


Does this "voluntary treatment" for mental illness -- open hospitals,
out-patient clinics, etc. mean replacement of evil by good? Does obsolescence
of military fortresses mean the world is safe for peace and
democracy? If the long arm of the law can handle you as easily in your
own home, as behind locked doors, it is happy to be relieved of being
called "keepers".


They've stopped (mostly, not entirely) thrashing and frightening
you with electric shock. They're beguiling you with drugs. You'll have
to keep coming because the after effects multiply and complicate your
problems. You have your outward symptoms changed, but the idea of
facing your problems is as impossible as any alcoholic's or narcotic's.
So the Huxley-type brave new world of enlightened "voluntary treatment"
grows. But it's really an Orwell 1984, if you look beneath
the surface.


Required reading for everyone who doesn't want to be hidden-persuaded
drugged or terrorized into a robot's life should be the HEW
(Health Education and Welfare) phamphlet entitled "How to be a
Trained Observer". A drag net is being laid. Trained observers (spies)
on who is and who is not mentally ill are being recruited, not by the
thousands but by the millions. Your minister, bartender, your baby sitter,
your bad neighbor are to be recruited and <i>trained</i> in how to recognize
your symptoms, and turn in their reports to your friendly Community
Psychiatric Center. This Mental Health Education, so called, is about
to permeate every nook and cranny of the universe. There are many
kind, well-meaning people who are used like an army by its evil generals.
But we must remember what hell is paved with.


And these people are "kind" superficially. At a deeper level, they
betray everyone -- just like the German population who went along
with Naziism betrayed even themselves. People aren't kind. "The we
only work here" attitude of the good natured employees of the invisible
monster of evil is in evidence in our state mental hospitals. They have
no guilt or remorse about collaboration with evil. Some of them know
the evil, and some do not. But none considers himself personally
responsible to eschew it. Thus, they present pleasant and kind-seeming
personalities. When not assisting with electric shock, they make good
partners for fun and games. Even the inmates don't place the blame on
them. With some exceptions. The rule is fraternizing of inmates with

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Without electric shock terror and later the tranquilizers, the picture
might have been different. In fact without these things, the detention
camps could never have grown to their present monstrous size. Such
numbers of mostly sane, hardworking, good natured people could never
have been brought under the management of so few.


Patients and hospital personnel alike can mostly be described
biblically:


They have eyes but they see not


Ears have they, neither do they hear


To them, corridors are only corridors.


The terror that is exuded from the walls is perceived only partially.


What is this terror -- that goes further, even, than the anticipation
of a single electric shock treatment? It is the feeling that if these hirelings
wuold do this, they would do ANYTHING. You remember the atrocities
towards the Jews and the guilt-free attitude that prevails amongst those
who directly or indirectly had a hand in it. You ask yourself ... if it
could happen here?


A big-city paper once ran a scandal about one of our big State hospitals
in which the reporters reported it to be a warehouse of human
storage. Yes, the present and the past have that character, but thanks to
the untiring efforts of your Menningers et al, it is slowly taking on a
country-club atmosphere. Eventually, the doors won't be closed any
more and eventually the cities and towns will be laid out in zones with
your mental health headquarters like filling stations all over the place.
The wonderful warehouse countryclub is eliminated. Of course right
now we're barely getting the countryclub, and that only in the richer
states. And don't fool yourself that these pretty places don't still have
their corridors. But eventually for the cooperating majority, they'll never
be seen.


But for a minority, even if not revisited, the word corridor will be
recalled metaphorically. People who have walked in them will always
have these corridors in their mind. Perhaps not as gross material aspect
but as psychic subtle aspect. Metamorphosis of a metaphor.


In the new Utopia, you are to have your symptoms serviced like your
car. You'll be able to get gassed and have your batteries charged, but
like your car, this treatment can't rejuvenate it indefinitely -- it becomes
junk. A living process is needed -- not services (treatment). Your friendly

Now, maybe you're getting fed up, and saying I'm just trying to be
science-fictiony. How do we know that this is fact, not science fiction?


Because of the DRAFT ACT ... and the support of it by a thing
called The JOINT COMMISSION ON MENTAL ILLNESS. The dark-night
day is dawning because their power is great, already.


Genuine great healers and teachers, Buddha -- Christ knew that the
aspirant to improvement must will his own salvation. Jesus did not
dictate a Draft Act to his disciples. Later some of his followers in the
Spanish Inquisition laid out a Draft Act. What's in a name?


The pseudo-science of psychiatry is moving into the vacuum left by
the Inquisitors. The Age of Reason proved unsatisfying. The Absolute
must return. Both real and phoney. Psychiatry is by no means an absolute.
The MOVEMENT asks nothing less than the identity of Medicine
and State. The citizen is to be rendered helpless against any and all of
the dubious treatments decreed for him by this group.


Thousands of clerics and their stooges of the Inquisition have found
bodies in the movement today. The corrupt priests of the new Church
will peddle you pills like the old priests of the corrupt old church sold indulgences.
You were forgiven your sins and iniquities if you patronized
them. And if you disagreed with them you were burned.
We need a <i>Reformation</i> in Science and Medicine.


A parting of the ways<br />
Let the honest, modest ones<br />
Depart from the Movement<br />
Taking with them what is theirs<br />
The arts<br />
And crafts<br />
The baths<br />
The fun and games<br />
The wholesome psychotherapy (not the other)<br />
Let them cease to be<br />
The pawns<br />
Of the invisible monster<br />
Who is their master<br />
Surely they can do without HIM!<br />
If not-let us do without THEM!<br />
DOWN WITH THE DRAFT ACT!

WILL FOR LIVING BODY


This document will outlaw at all times and places for the rest of my
life use of any so-called therapy by any physician against my will. I
am at time of writing of sound mind.


If I should fall ill, as a result of which I should be in a coma or
near-coma (as for instance as a result of injuries received in an accident,
or any illness which might affect the soundness of my judgement), then
Dr...... of .....
should be notified. If Dr......should be
unavailable at the rime, then the following alternative Drs. should
be contacted. These alternative Doctors' names are attached at end of
this will. Dr...... and all of these alternative
Drs. in signing their names to this document agree to care for me as my
temporary guardian until such time as my mind is normal. This does
not mean that they are authorized to use any therapy they may see fit.
It means that if surgery be used, it should be used only if death or
serious consequences should threaten my physical body as a result of
injuries or acute serious illness. No type of therapy such as psychosurgery,
electric shock or insulin shock or administration of drugs coming
under the category of therapy for mental illness, or in fact of any
drugs coming under any category, except as anesthesia in case of post-accident
surgery, or acute illness surgery, and that only, as aforesaid,
if my life is in danger without their use. No tranquillizers or sedatives
are to be used. This shall include not only all known forms of mental-illness
treatments but also treatments perhaps not yet invented at the
time of this writing.


If established by <i>due process</i> that I require detention, then let
this be carried out under direction as to place of this detention by
Dr...... This document will render invalid
any commitment which might have taken place in ignorance of it.
However, if there is reluctance on the part of these detainers to respect
this document, then it is understood that the Drs. and lawyers undersigned
will file appeal petitions until my release from these detainers
is secured.


Dr...... and alternatives, also lawyers undersigned
agree to abide by prohibitions and rules set herein and also
they obligate themselves to visit and consult with me at my request.
If I should request to see them in Bombay, or some distant point, they
are not excused but must refer me to local care adhering to all rules,
with the understanding that as soon as I am able to travel, the local
people will release me to their care. They are obligated to inform the

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Any permission I may sign for treatments when in an abnormal state
of mind, or under drugs shall be invalidated by this Will. This Will is
my declaration of NO FAITH in Psychiatry, past, present or future. I
prefer to remain untreated for any real or alleged mental illness. I prefer
my own mind, though mad, to a mind conditioned by devices employed
by others against MY OWN VOLITION. This includes hypnotic or
psychological techniques deliberately imposed to alter my mental
processes. It does not include psycho-therapy which invites but does
not impose itself upon my consciousness. In other words, if healers
there be and if the methods used by these healers is to heal by inviting
my own participation, they are welcome. What is to be prohibited is
alteration of the mind without my conscious consent, from the outside,
as it were. Or by prohibited unnatural methods of gaining my consent.
In short, no conditioning from the outside may take place. I hold it to
be self-evident that an individual's mind is his own; not subject to treatment
by any other individual or society itself. If society, by due process,
can declare me to be so mentally ill that I must be confined, that confinement
cannot extend beyond my physical body, and enter the sacred
regions of mind and soul. A mind that is subject to other minds is less
free though he may roam the earth, sea and air, than a mind that is not
subject to any other mind, though confined within a prison. I hereby
declare myself in favor of my own folly to the enforced so-called wisdom
of outside parties. This is my faith and my philosophy.


The Drs., lawyers and other parties listed at end of this WILL,
and signing are to be legally authorized to be temporary guardians of
my person and property, so that any necessary expense in carrying out
the terms of this Will may be insured. Their privilege and obligation
is to secure immediate remedial legal aid should I fall under care,
domination or treatment by persons publicly or privately known as
Drs. or phychiatrists, but whose practices are alien to the conditions
set herein. May be cancelled by myself or signers except at time of crisis.


UNSENT LETTER TO A PSYCHOANALYST


Dear Dr. E.


I wrote you this letter in 1957 but decided not to send it because
it seemed futile. Whether I'll ever send this one remains to be seen.
I have hopes of making practical progress with one of your colleagues
in setting up a system of protection from the growing power of the
psychiatric profession. I have in mind a legal document, a contract, to be

There is a question that keeps coming to me. When I wrote you
from the goat farm in 1955, I received a reply in which you told me
I had developed good intellectual insights but that emotionally, I
hadn't. You agreed that electric shock treatments were no panacea ...
but you said neither was analysis unless combined with LIFE. In other
words, I had learned to analyze, but not to live. Frankly, I found this
a bit ironic, (speaking of living) under the circumstances I was under
at the time. I was threatened with return to hospital (I'd only been
out for two months) and this came about, as I feared, though I was
let out on work-leave six months later. This irony has resulted in this
letter, my real answer in 1958 to your answer to my letter in '55.


When you said, "Only LIFE can help you", I believe you made a
word or idea trap for yourself there that makes me feel entitled to ask
you this big question. Why don't you analysts recognize the importance
of people living without analysis? "Well", you say, "We're not going
to stop you." "Well," I say, "but do you <i>help</i> us make our world <i>safe</i>
for this freedom"? There are lots of other people that stop us ...
kidnappers who hold us until we come to terms. These gangs are headed
by an outfit known as the American Psychiatric Association. Most
analysts are members (in addition to their own associations) and many
are only part-time analysts, and do some of the electrical, drug, etc.
on the side.


I have a bee in my bonnet ... making a "will" outlawing these
scoundrels from dragging me through their fiery furnaces ever again.


Why is your concern over your patients limited to analysis, which
you say yourself is ineffectual without LIFE. What are you doing
about LIFE? Is using your <i>professional power</i> to underwrite a person's
right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness not your affair?


Have you people ever stopped to think of the dilemma a person can
be caught in, a person like me who wants to <i>live?</i> There are wolves in
the forest and little Red Riding Hood is scared. These wolves make
you carry an identity card. This identity card nowadays (and even more
so, in the future, the way things seem to be shaping up) must be signed
by an M.D.


If one is wealthy enough to have an analyst, well and good. If not,

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When little Red Riding Hood was twenty, she got into a wonderful
trance-like state which ignorant wolves at Phipps Clinic, Baltimore
diagnosed as schizophrenia. If she had only met up with a Yogi on that
walk through the forest, who would not have given her a year of wet
sheet packs, she would have been happy. Or if the wolves had just
realized their constitutional limitations ... when they asked her what
she was doing just sitting there, she would have said, "Mr. Wolf, I'm a
Yogi, Good Day!" That is if she had met the Yogi at that time who
could have told her she was one. Now she knows. But can she say
to the next wolf in similar circumstances that she may run into "Mr.
Wolf, I'm a Yogi, Good Day!". He's almost certain to reply, "Just a
minute there, Miss Yogi, let me see your Identity Card ... Ho! Ho!
Ho! Schizophrenic, eh"? Then he blows a whistle and a whole pack
descends on her, and this time, they gave her such drastic "therapy"
that she completely forgets she is Little Red Riding Hood.


I want an Identity card, not labelled Yogi, to be sure. In fact, Yoga
is being popularized and <i>commercialized</i> so fast nowadays that soon
the woods will be as full of phoney Yogis as they are of phoney
psychoanalysts. I merely want a card insisting on my full constitutional
rights, including the right to be unwell, and unhappy without having
cures applied by force and violence against my will. In the days of the
Inquisition, they tried to save people's souls from going to hell by
compulsion. Same thing. I am determined not to be raw material for
future gigantic Mental Health Factories.


Au revior,


IMAGINARY CONVERSATION WITH A
PUSH-BUTTON PSYCHIATRIST


(ABOUT 1956)


A meeting of the A.P.A. (American Psycho-Sadistic Association) is
dispersing. I am picketing the meeting alone, and I spot the villian of
a nine month torture period which I received at a private sanitarium. I
address him as follows:


"Hey there, you dapper, diabolical Doctor dandy, may I have a word
with you?"


"Oh, so, it's you. I suppose you want to hear all about our latest

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No doubt. But I still want to find out what made you do the terrible
things you did to me back in 1953. That was bad enough for me,
thank you."


"Oh, don't get yourself all worked up lassie, we do these things day
in, day out."


"But why do you do it, Dr. Humbugger?"


"Why? Why do you think? It's our bread and butter and we're not
rich at that. Not yet."


"But where is your integrity?"


Integrity? Come, now, my dear, you must be very naive. We don't
have any of that because we all do what all the rest do, and if you ask
any of us to define integrity, there's your definition right there, dearie."


"But Dr. Humbugger, I know you're a scoundrel, just like most of the
others, but why?"


"Terror is a handy device for controlling difficult people if it is
properly labelled as "treatment". Actually, in a minority of cases, it is
helpful to a certain extent. Because of this, we get away with large-scale
racketeering, giving it to all and sundry, regardless."


"Aren't you a terrible wretch?"


"Oh, you are stupid, blue eyes. I can't spend any more time in this
kind of silly talk. I'm enrolling in a six week's course in some kind of
radiation therapy they think is going to go over big. Then, maybe I'll
be a really rich wretch. Heh! Heh! But why are you so mad at me?
What about how they gave you the same thing out in the State place?
They did the same thing to you ... even more ... than I did."


"Oh, now you're being stupid. You surely know why they gave them
to me, don't you?"


"No, why? Those State-hired Drs. aren't paid per treatment the way
we private practitioners are."


Oh, you certainly don't know Medical bureaucracy, do you?"


"Well, maybe not. Come to think of it, the tax-paying citizens are
just the same as your private customers. No one could be boss of a
public institution if he didn't follow the medical trends of the times.
This shock treatment racket swept the country. The public adores what
the medical associations decree ... so they wouldn't be satisfied with
unorthodoxy in public institutions. The taxpayers all want the latest
methods, be they ever-so-cruel."


"Yes, that's it."


"Oh, my, my, I really must be dashing along. My advice to you is
to keep your mouth shut before you get into trouble!"


"Well, I guess this is a waste of time."


"Of course it is. Why don't you see a psycho-analyst? I think you
would like them better. They never use force and violence and we don't

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Can you refer me to some one who's different from you?"


"Hmmm. Not personally. We psycho-sadists are not usually on good
terms with the psycho-analytically oriented ones. That's what they
call it. But I do know one who uses both. Ah, yes ... Dr. Turner ...
I met him at a meeting the other day. Yes, here he is: Dr. Christopher
Current Turner. It was a protest meeting -- ex-electrical workers suffering
technological unemployment."


"Oh, Dr. Humbugger ... Dr. Turner cannot be a psycho-analyst.
They wouldn't be at that kind of a rally. Why they're very exclusive."


"Oh no. You're right. Dr. Turner isn't really a member of the
Psychoanalytic Association. But he uses this therapy called psychoanalytically
oriented, because he took some training along that line.
I've thought of trying to qualify for that, but we old birds leave that
to the younger ones."


"He sounds like neither fish nor fowl."


"Well ... good luck. I must hurry. I'm late for that pharmaceutical
meeting. They're talking of changing our name from the Psycho-Sadists
to something prettier. But I'm against it! I'm too old to learn Double
think! Bye now!


BEAUTY TREATMENT <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_46611');">[note]</a><div id="_note_46611" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗The names of characters in this narrative are fictitious, but the narrative is not

She came on duty and ... yes, she was looking at me, and coming
towards me. What was it about? I hadn't behaved in any untoward
way, and at the moment I was looking at <i>Life</i>. It was a calm morning ...
except for the usual din coming from the television, placed high up near
the ceiling where no one could turn it off, and where it could only be
manipulated by use of a special key which jangled with the dozen or so
keys which she, Miss Gimpsum, like all the other nurses, had attached
to her waistline.


She smelled of toilet water, and her ostentatiously lacy handkerchief
adorned the breast pocket where it was secured with a fancy pin, after
having been arranged in anything but carelessly wrought folds. This
offset the clinical appearance and all nurses made the most of this
means of looking decorative because it was the only possibility ...

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Miss Gimpsum was an unusually bonny, applecheeked, and good
natured type. Her soft brown eyes and smile radiated vitality in need
of a positive outlet and effort to be helpful and improve the ward for
the better of all concerned.


I returned her visual attention by looking at her steadily, quizzically
... without fear. Somehow, I knew nothing very terrible could be
about to happen to me just then. It was Friday. Shock treatments were
given on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and
Mondays, those of us who always got them tried to forget ... and
concentrate on the present, as much as possible.


I was seated along the row of chairs at the south window where the
sun was streaming in like silent music, and I was basking in it as I
always did when I could get a seat there ... usually beside Bernice,
as I did today. Fortunately, most of the chairs were lined up facing TV
but B.'s and my seats had a line of vision at right angles to TV which
made it less disturbing, and also if you are in a single row instead of
in a row among rows, it is much better.


Bernice, with her usual self-possession, hardly glanced at Miss
Gimpsum except out of the corner of her eye, and her <i>Reader's Digest</i>
was nicely poised. She knew, better than anyone on the ward, how to
mind her own business. B. could actually read, reread, or appear to be
reading these same old worn out issues almost all day, and unlike me,
she never wandered off down the corridors to look out the window
at the end, or stay overlong in the lavatory smoking cigarettes and talking,
laughing, commiserating, or arguing with others. And she never
sat down on the lavatory floor to smoke. She never spoke to anyone
unless spoken to, and I was one of the few who ever spoke to her. Her
conversation was very intelligent and her appearance was strikingly
beautiful. She had natural blonde hair down to her waist, which she
always kept done up with a French twist. This was one reason (among
others) why Miss Gimpsum would never have selected Bernice for the
therapeutic project which she now approached me with.


"Well, M., how about doing something about that hair?" She was
coaxing me, only ... not being insistent.


"But I'm letting it grow!" She paused and appraised me for a while,
then earnestly said:


"But they're just not wearing it long, now." On the OUTSIDE, she
meant. It was 1955. Short cropped hair was the newest thing.


I knew what the Beauty Parlor was like. They had old machine
permanents -- instead of cold waves -- operated by patients ... ex-beauticians

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697836-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Should I explain to Miss Gimpsum that I was tender-headed ... and
that short-tempered operators, even on the "outside" sometimes pulled
my hair in their frustration in coping with the phenomenal thickness
of it?


B.'s classic profile never altered during the cajoling and solicitous
pleas Miss Gimpsum was engaging me with. This was not the moment
for giving me one of her flashing smiles of sympathy warmed with her
humorous insights. This scene could have been smiled away, except for
one element in the situation ... and B. and any and everyone knew
what that was. I tried stalling, and excusing myself good-naturedly to
Miss G., and looked to B. for a supporting smile. But none was forth-coming.
B.'s lashes were steadily fixed in line with the upper edges
of her magazine. Her detachment from the present discussion signalled
to me what my final answer should be. B. never got EST. It was rarely
given to alcoholics or psychopaths, or what was roughly classified as
socially deviant. In B.'s case, it must have been her alleged prostitution.
Her story was that she was not engaged in soliciting in the bar where
she was picked up ... but that she was merely down on her luck,
and between jobs. She was a Shakespearian actress and a certified public
accountant, she said. She insisted endlessly that she should have been
allowed to serve sentence for vagrancy, rather than just being put away
here, where nothing happened. Time passed. Three years for B., here
at Toho State. I always affirmed her view of indignation at the injustice
done to her. Fire blazed from her eyes, and from the very pores of her
skin. I could believe she had been a Shakespearian actress. Her English
was very fine ... in fact, she was a native of England, and she seemed
to have great dramatic passion beneath her reserve and dignity ...
especially when she repeated her indignation, as she often did, to almost
no one but me.


I acquiesced to Miss G. Always cooperate with all positive activities
... and don't seem as if you just wanted to be stubborn and do as
you pleased.


It was a well-groomed victim who was laid out on the table the
following Tuesday ... on treatment day. Ah! Miss Gimpsum ... I
might as well have said "No."
