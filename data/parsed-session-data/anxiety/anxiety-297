<font size="4"><b>10: Psychological Manifestations of Physical Disease in the Elderly</b></font>

One of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of working with an elderly
population is multidimensional assessment. Cognitive, psychosocial, familial,
environmental, financial-legal, as well as medical factors grow increasingly
salient with aging for determining intervention strategies. (See also
Chapter 19, discussing interdisciplinary care.) Although medical conditions
usually are the primary factor driving the patient's treatment, often there are
associated psychological conditions. Yet practitioners are frequently ill-prepared
to assess the psychological concomitants of medical illness. In part, our
lack of knowledge is due to the lack of training opportunities in this area; in
part, it is due to the lack of a well-researched knowledge base in the field.


The purpose of this chapter is to summarize recent findings about the
relationships between selected medical and mental health conditions. In
understanding these complex relationships, practitioners become more alert
to the roles of both psyche and soma in the etiology and treatment of mental

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Medical and mental health conditions interact in a number of ways. Mental
health practitioners are trained to recognize and treat psychological reactions
prompted by physical disorders and psychological conditions that render
individuals vulnerable to physical disorders. Medical practitioners are trained
to recognize and treat psychological symptoms that may arise in response to
the treatment of physical complaints, such as drug reactions. Both types of
practitioners are familiar with somatization disorders, in which psychological
disorders manifest themselves as physical complaints. This chapter will focus
on physical disorders that cause biologically based psychological symptoms
as well as those that, when undetected, can appear as psychological symptoms.


The goals are to improve mental health practitioners' sensitivity to possible
underlying medical conditions and to encourage mental health practitioners
to adopt therapeutic strategies that are appropriate for selected medical conditions
and their treatments. Thus, when there is strong indication that there
may be a biological component to the depression or other mental disorder that
accompanies a particular disease, consideration should be given to pharmacological
agents and to psychotherapies that stress adaptation to and coping
with the disease and its psychosocial ramifications.


A major difficulty of these complex interactions is that psychological
symptoms are often nonspecific; that is, different patients might present signs
of depression, anxiety, or cognitive impairment, all in relation to the same
physical condition. With that caveat in mind, each section will begin with a
brief description of the medical condition followed by reports of incidence
and prevalence of mental health symptomatology, when known. Last, evidence
will be reviewed on whether the mental health symptoms might be
present prodromally and whether there is evidence for a biological basis for
the associated mental health symptoms.


<b>Parkinson's Disease</b>


Parkinson's disease is a disease of the basal ganglia characterized by stiff
and slow motor movements (rigidity and bradykinesia). The patient may have
a resting hand tremor, which may occur on only one side. He or she may be
unsteady when standing or walking and have difficulty initiating motor
activity, such as walking. Other features include fatigue, a soft and monotonous
voice, "masked facies" or rigid facial expression, constipation, decreased
libido, and mental slowing (bradyphrenia). The course is chronic and progressive,

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many people may suffer from some or all of these Parkinsonian symptoms
(known as <i>Parkinsonism</i>) without actually having Parkinson's disease; the
symptoms may be due to a variety of causes, such as medication reactions or
other neurodegenerative diseases.


Depression has long been recognized as a frequently associated feature of
Parkinson's disease, although it was described in earlier decades as an understandable,
reactive "demoralization" (Starkstein &amp; Mayberg, 1993). Although
many studies have suffered from ambiguous definitions of depression and
questionable instrumentation, most report a high frequency of depression in
Parkinson's disease. Mayeux and his colleagues (Mayeux, 1982, Mayeux et
al., 1986; Mayeux, Stern, Rosen, &amp; Leventhal, 1981) found depression in one
quarter to one half of all Parkinson's patients. Starkstein, Preziosi, Bolduc,
and Robinson (1990) report, with standardized questionnaires and criteria
listed in the third edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders</i> (<i>DSM-III;</i> American Psychiatric Association, 1980) for depression,
a 41 % rate of depression among 105 consecutive outpatients being followed
for Parkinson's disease. Half of the depressed patients met criteria for major
depression and half for minor (dysthymic) depression. Among early-stage
patients with unilateral symptoms, left hemisphere Parkinson's disease patients
had significantly more frequent and severe depressions than those with
right hemisphere Parkinson's disease. Among late-stage patients, depression
was correlated only with age and activity in daily living impairment. Starkstein
et al. (1990) suggest that, early in the disease, structural or biochemical
changes, or both, in the left basal ganglia may be an etiological factor in the
depression.


Can Parkinson's disease manifest as depression? Starkstein et al. (1990)
found that of patients with both major depression and Parkinson's disease,
29% suffered a history of depression prior to the appearance of any motor
symptoms. In contrast, only 5% of patients with minor depression and Parkinson's
disease and 2% of patients with no depression and Parkinson's disease
had prior histories of depression. Although this research does not directly
address the issue of prodromal depression (i.e., depression as a first sign of
Parkinson's disease), it does suggest that patients with major depression prior
to Parkinson's onset are more vulnerable to a concomitant depression after
onset.


To address the question of prodromal depression, Santamaria, Tolosa, and
Valles (1986) studied 34 patients with recent-onset Parkinson's disease who
were not being treated with dopaminergic agents. In 15 cases (44%), depression
antedated motoric manifestations of Parkinson's disease. This group was
also characterized by younger age at onset, a higher proportion of familial

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to depression, cognitive impairment is frequently cited as a
condition concomitant with Parkinson's disease. Cummings (1988) reviewed
27 studies representing 4,336 patients with Parkinson's disease for prevalence
of overt dementia. He reported an overall prevalence rate of 39.9%, with a
range from 30% in studies using nonstandardized interviews to 70% in studies
using neuropsychological assessment techniques.


In the 20% to 40% of Parkinson's disease patients who develop frank
dementia, approximately one half will be found to have the pathologic
changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (i.e., neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles) on autopsy (Katzman &amp; Rowe, 1992). Impairments typically
are manifested in memory, visuospatial skills, and set aptitude. Language
function is usually spared. Cognitive impairments increase with age,
akinesia, and duration of illness. The latter finding suggests that cognitive
impairment is progressive, not prodromal, and would not usually be a presenting
symptom of Parkinson's disease.


Anxiety has also been reported with Parkinson's disease (Schiffer, Kurlan,
Rubin, &amp; Boer, 1988; Stein, Heuser, Juncos, &amp; Uhde, 1990). In a comparison
of 16 depressed Parkinson's disease patients and 20 depressed multiple
sclerosis patients, Schiffer et al. (1988) found significantly more comorbid
anxiety disorders among the Parkinson's disease patients. Twelve of the 16
Parkinson's disease patients met the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia--Lifetime Version research diagnostic criteria for past or
present generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Only 2 of the 20
multiple sclerosis patients met these criteria. Stein et al. (1990) studied 24
Parkinson's disease patients without dementia. Nine (38%) of the 24 patients
received a <i>DSM-III-R</i> (APA, 1987) diagnosis of current anxiety disorder. One
had generalized anxiety disorder, three had panic disorder, one had panic
disorder and social phobia, three had social phobia alone, and one had an
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified.


Is there evidence for a biological basis for the depression seen in Parkinson's
disease? In discussing psychological and biological factors in Parkinson's
depression, Starkstein and Mayberg (1993) present evidence against a
psychological explanation (depression often is seen before motor symptoms,
and ADL impairments are not significantly correlated with depression until

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Practitioners should also be alert to the possible side effects of the Parkinson's
disease medications. The most commonly used pharmacological agents
are the compounds containing levodopa, now often combined with carbidopa
(e.g., Sinemet). Although the most common side effects are nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, and dizziness, there is a risk of central nervous system effects, such
as confusion, hallucinations, and nightmares. Newer medications, used as
adjuncts to levodopa-carbidopa, may also increase the risk of confusion and
hallucinations. These include bromocriptine (Parlodel), pergolide (Permax),
and selegiline (Eldepryl) (Smith &amp; Reynard, 1992).


<b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</b>


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of degenerative
diseases of the airways. Prominent among these diseases are chronic bronchitis
and emphysema. The central features are dyspnea (the patient's subjective
sense of the inability to obtain enough air), cough, and sputum production.
The preclinical course can be as long as 30 to 40 years followed by an active
clinical phase of approximately 10 years.


Depressive symptomatology is the most prominent psychological feature
associated with COPD, estimated to occur in one quarter to one half of COPD
patients (Murrell, Himmelfarb, &amp; Wright, 1983). Borson et al. (1986) and
Kukull et al. (1986) estimate the prevalence of diagnosable major depression
at 12% to 15% among COPD patients.


Although generalized anxiety and panic disorder are reported clinically,
there have been no systematic studies of the prevalence of anxiety disorders
in COPD (Borson &amp; McDonald, 1989). It is known, however, that when
metabolic demands are out of balance with respiratory response, the patient
may experience hypoxia and dyspnea followed by a secondary, symptom-related
anxiety. This secondary anxiety places further demands on the respiratory
system, causing a feedback loop that exacerbates both respiratory and
psychological symptomatology.


Can COPD present as depression or anxiety? There is no direct evidence
of a prodromal or biologically based depression in COPD. It has been
recognized for decades (Dudley, Martin, Masuda, Ripley, &amp; Holmes, 1969),

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once the COPD has been diagnosed, the mental health issues should be an
integral part of the treatment. The relationships of depression, anxiety, respiration,
and activity levels are interactive. Therefore, mental health interventions
can be key in maintaining the client's commitment to and compliance
with treatment and rehabilitation programs, and the patient's adapting to
losses in functional capacity, and maintaining positive relationships with
caregivers.


As the disease progresses, the client may experience cognitive symptoms
due to hypoxemia (oxygen deprivation) or hypercapnia (CO<sub>2</sub> retention).
Deficits that have been reported (Block, 1983; Grant et al., 1987; McSweeny,
Grant, Heaton, Adams, &amp; Timms, 1985) include decreases in mental alertness,
mental efficiency, complex problem solving, memory, and motor coordination
and speed. Oxygen therapy substantially improves most of these cognitive
symptoms. Theophylline, a commonly used bronchodilator, can cause
cognitive impairment, anxiety, agitation, and insomnia. These symptoms are
usually dose related and may reflect drug toxicity. Oral corticosteroids such
as prednisone are also commonly used to treat COPD; they can cause a wide
variety of mental disturbances ranging from anxiety, euphoria, and depression
to psychosis. These symptoms may be severe enough to prompt discontinuing
the drug, which requires careful medical supervision. Therefore, their presence
should prompt referral to the treating physician for reeevaluation of
medication levels.


The use of inhaled bronchodilating agents is a common treatment for COPD
patients. Some patients may overuse the inhalers in an attempt to avoid all
sensation of dyspnea. Teaching breathing and relaxation techniques can help
redirect the tendency to overuse the inhalers.


Sleep disturbance is a frequent complaint of COPD patients, which can
further negatively affect affective and cognitive functioning. According to
Borson and McDonald (1989), the well-managed COPD patient should not
have to waken more than once per night for bronchodilator treatment. If a

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00229&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Clearly in COPD, there is a complex interaction between the biological,
psychological, and social factors of the disease and its management. Antidepressant
medications appear to be efficacious in treating the minority of
patients whose depressive syndromes meet criteria for major depression or
minor depression with anxiety and some vegetative signs (Borson &amp; McDonald,
1989). Commonly prescribed antianxiety medications (primarily benzodiazepines)
can depress respiration and therefore should be used cautiously
with COPD patients. Nonmedical therapies (e.g., relaxation training, breathing
rehabilitation) that reduce biological symptoms are reported to be useful,
as are individual and group therapies focused on adaptation to this difficult,
progressive disease (Dudley, Glaser, Jorgenson, &amp; Logan, 1980; Knapp &amp;
Mathe, 1985).


<b>Cardiovascular Disease</b>


As with COPD, the term <i>cardiovascular disease</i> actually refers to a group
of disorders, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart
disease, arrhythmias and conduction disorders, heart failure, and the peripheral
vascular diseases. In all of these disorders, due to either heart or vascular
disease, the organism has difficulty sustaining a regular, sufficient blood
supply throughout the body. Closely related are the cerebrovascular diseases,
which affect the blood supply to the brain; these two types of vascular disease
frequently coexist.


Cohen-Cole (1989) reports that patients with chronic heart disease experience
significant depressive symptomatology at a rate of between 10% and
20% and major depression at a rate of about 5%. He further suggests that
anxiety may be a prominent feature in cardiovascular disease because this
disease is often more unpredictable and more life threatening than other
chronic illnesses.


Most of the research on psychological factors in cardiovascular disease has
focused on the relationship of depression and coronary artery disease (CAD).
In a major meta-analysis of personality and disease, Friedman and Booth-Kewley
(1987) found depression to be as major a risk factor for CAD as
cigarette smoking. The predictive power of depression increased when the
analysis was limited to prospective studies of myocardial infarction (MI). In
a retrospective study, Lloyd and Cawley (1983) found that of 18 patients who
were depressed after a first MI, 6 had been depressed prior to the MI.
Therefore, there is evidence of a strong association between depression and

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00230&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to findings that depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular
events, there is also a substantial literature that documents the negative effects
of depression on outcome. Carney et al. (1988) followed 52 patients with
known CAD over a 12-month follow-up period. Controlling for illness severity
and other risk factors and using standardized measures of depression, the
authors were able to show a twofold increase in the incidence of new cardiac
events among the patients who were depressed at baseline. Depression was
the best predictor of new cardiac events. Stern, Pascale, and Ackerman (1977)
and Mayeux, Foster, and Williamson (1978) showed that depressed CAD
patients fared more poorly with psychosocial rehabilitation relative to non-depressed
patients. Rabins, Harvis, and Koven (1985) also found a twofold
increase in mortality among CAD patients with major depression. Silverstone
(1987) reported an increased risk of early death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest
associated with depression in the first 48 hours following a myocardial
infarction.


Because of the apparent association of depression and cardiovascular
disease, researchers have searched for a mechanism to explain the relationship.
Early work on the relationship between psychological factors and
cardiovascular disease focused on "Type A" personalities. Current work,
summarized in Blascovich and Katkin (1993), focuses on the psychological
mediators between environmental Stressors and cardiovascular responses. The
researchers represented in that volume are investigating various links and
patterns among stress, individual cardiovascular reactivity, and last, cardiovascular
disease. This work is very much still in progress but holds great
promise for future understanding of the complex relationships between psychological
and cardiovascular variables. It is also promising in that it will lead
to appropriate therapeutic strategies with cardiovascular patients. The therapist
may attempt to interrupt the stress-reactivity-disease process at either the
psychological level (i.e., cognitive appraisal of stress) or at the physiological
level (i.e., learned control of myocardial or vascular responses to perceived
stress).


Whatever the preexisting psychophysiological vulnerabilities to cardiovascular
disease, postevent reactions are common. Cohen-Cole (1989) notes the
typical "homecoming" depression, when a post-MI patient is released from
the hospital often unprepared for the fatigue, fears, and change of lifestyle
that he or she faces. Education about MI (including sexual education), support,

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00231&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Last, cardioactive and antihypertensive medications are often psychoactive
as well. In particular, Beta-blockers such as propanolol/Inderal, which has
been shown to decrease mortality in CAD patients, can cause depression,
mental confusion, or both (Hurst, 1986). To further complicate matters,
antidepressant medications (especially the tricyclic antidepressants such as
amitryptyline/Elavil, desipramine/Norpramin, and nortryptyline/Pamelor) can be
especially complex to manage in a cardiac patient due to their potential
cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is particularly important when treating depression,
anxiety, or both in a cardiovascular patient to have very close communication
among patient, mental health practitioner, and physician.


In summary, there is evidence that preexisting depression may render individuals
vulnerable to CAD, although there is no evidence of a specific prodromal
period. Research on postevent depression has focused on psychological rather
than biological bases, with the exception of medication reactions.


<b>Cerebrovascular Disease</b>


Closely related to the cardiovascular conditions are the cerebrovascular
diseases. Whenever blood flow to the brain is reduced or interrupted, either
due to heart disease or atherosclerotic changes in cerebral vessels, the patient
will experience cognitive effects from the resulting anoxia. Usually, these
effects are global and most evident in higher cortical functions (Rosenberg,
1980). When a patient complains of confusion, disorientation, and impaired
memory, and particularly when these symptoms fluctuate, the clinician should
always arrange for a dementia evaluation to differentiate reversible from
irreversible conditions, vascular from neurodegenerative processes, and to
rule out delirium.


A patient who reports repeated falls and who may or may not demonstrate
cognitive deficits also should be thoroughly evaluated. Falls are extremely
common among the elderly and can result from myriad causes, including
rnusculoskeletal, sensory, and neurological disorders in addition to adverse
drug reactions. If the etiology of the falls is unclear, the patient should be
evaluated for underlying cardiac or cerebrovascular problems. Cardiac-related
falls may be preceded by syncope (a brief loss of consciousness),
although this may not be reported initially by the patient. Syncope represents
an interruption in blood flow to the brain, due either to cardiac or cerebrovascular
conditions. Cerebrovascular-related falls are often accompanied by
dizziness, visual changes, syncope, asymmetric extremity weakness, or a
combination of these.

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00232&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By far, the most common cerebrovascular condition in the elderly is stroke.
Caplan (1990) defines <i>stroke</i> as "a heterogeneous category of illness that
describes brain injury, usually sudden, caused by vascular disease." He
distinguishes between brain hemorrhage and brain ischemia and between
permanent versus transient conditions (the latter primarily comprised of
transient ischemic attacks). Power and Hachinski (1990) report that 85% of
those suffering from stroke are over 65 years old and that stroke is the third
leading cause of death in North America.


An impressive amount of research has been conducted on the relationship
between stroke and depression. Lipsey and Parikh (1989) reported on a series of
quantitative studies on poststroke depressive disorders. They demonstrated that
clinical depression is a common consequence of stroke, occurring in 47% of the
patients immediately following stroke (during hospitalization) and increasing to
60% of the patients at 6-month follow-up. None of the patients had been treated
with antidepressants, reflecting the common attitude that poststroke depression
is "normal." The authors further demonstrated the importance of the site of the
lesion, with left anterior lesions showing significantly higher correlations with
severity of depression. Using a placebo-controlled design, the authors went on to
investigate the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy with poststroke patients
and were able to show significant improvement with the use of nortriptyline/
Pamelor. Last, in two related studies, the same authors show the negative effects
of untreated depression on poststroke cognitive and physical recovery.


Lipsey and Parikh's early work has been substantiated and extended by
more recent studies. In a review of depression in poststroke patients admitted
to acute units, general hospitals, and rehabilitation centers, Starkstein and
Robinson (1993) reported prevalence rates ranging from 30% to 50%. Reporting
findings from follow-up studies, these authors added that poststroke major
depression appears to resolve after approximately 1 year, whereas poststroke
minor depression lasts for over 2 years, on average. Lesion location is
associated with duration of depression, with middle cerebral (cortical) artery
areas associated with longer duration and subcortical, or cerebellar-brainstem,
lesions associated with briefer durations of depression.


Using a prospective, longitudinal design with right hemisphere lesion
patients, Starkstein and Robinson (1993) further investigated the relationship
between lesion location and depression. They found that immediately post-stroke,
depression was more likely to occur in patients with right posterior
lesion locations; however, at 6-month follow-up, depression was higher
among patients with right anterior lesion locations. This suggests a dynamic
relationship between location of insult and depression, with the length of time
since stroke onset as a mediating variable.


In another series of studies, Starkstein and his colleagues (Starkstein,
Robinson, Berthier, Parikh, &amp; Price, 1988; Starkstein, Robinson, &amp; Price,

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00233&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Looking at associated mental health symptoms, Starkstein et al. (1990)
reported an association between poststroke depression and anxiety. Bolla-Wilson,
Robinson, Starkstein, Boston, and Price (1989) reported an association
between poststroke depression and cognitive impairment.


The work cited does suggest a biological component to poststroke depression,
yet surprisingly few studies report on the use of antidepressants with this
population. Starkstein and Robinson (1993) summarized these studies and
concluded that both tricyclic antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy
can be useful in treating poststroke depression. The newer seratonergic agents
will probably prove most appropriate because of fewer cardiac-related side
effects. Both the patient and the family may be helped by understanding that
the depression may be a direct effect of a brain lesion, particularly when the
lesion is in the left anterior area.


Major strokes present obvious motor and cognitive symptoms and are not
likely to appear prodromally as psychological symptoms. However, more
subtle cognitive warning signs of cerebrovascular disease, such as brief
confusional states, falls, dizziness, or fainting, may be reported to mental
health practitioners and should be followed with a referral to the treating
physician. Although depression does not seem to figure prodromally in stroke,
it does seem to be frequently unrecognized or untreated poststroke. Further-more,
there is some evidence that certain risk factors for developing poststroke
depression could be addressed preventively. Given the high toll among elders
from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions, mental health practitioners
can also play an important medical prevention role through support
for lifestyle modification. Structured programs for smoking cessation, healthy
eating habits, and exercise all can be integrated into a more traditional
psychotherapeutic approach.


<b>Cancer</b>


Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (following
heart disease). Fifty percent of all cancers occur in people over the age of 65
years (Cohen, 1990). Although all cancers have malignant growth of tissue in
common, there is great variability in course, outcome, and associated psychological
features according to site and type of lesion.


The diagnosis of cancer-related depression (the most commonly cited
psychological feature) is complicated by the somatic features of the disease.

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00234&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A related, controversial issue is whether clinical depression or depressive
personality features predispose a person to cancer or promote an existing
cancer. Fox (1989) reviewed studies that link personality traits to cancer,
especially tendencies toward self-blame, self-sacrifice, hopelessness, and
despair. Three prospective studies were cited that investigated the relationship
between the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scale for depression
and cancer. Although one of the latter studies (Shekelle et al., 1981) made
a fairly strong case for predisposition to cancer among depressed males, from
all the studies published to that point, Fox concluded that the evidence for this
relationship is weak. The evidence is similarly mixed for a relationship
between depression and mortality in cancer patients (Rodin et al., 1993).
Much of this research is hampered by lack of standardized measures, variety
of tumors studied, and variability of outcome measures.


Can cancer first appear as depression? There is long-standing and substantial
evidence that this is the case in pancreatic cancer. Gilliam (1990) writes, "Depression
is such a well-known presenting finding that unexplained depression in
an elderly male without an antecedent history mandates a search for pancreatic
cancer" (p. 643). Several studies have documented higher rates of early depression
in pancreatic, as opposed to gastric or colon, cancer (Fras, Litin, &amp; Pearson,
1967; Holland et al., 1986; Jacobsson &amp; Ottosson, 1971). In a methodologically
refined study, Joffe, Rubinow, Denicoff, Maher, and Sindelar (1986) were able
to demonstrate that 50% of patients diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas
fulfilled research diagnostic criteria for major depression during the year prior to
diagnosis, whereas none of those with cancer of the stomach met the criteria.
Several biological mechanisms have been postulated to explain the high prevalence,
and tendency toward prodromal presentation, of depression in pancreatic
cancer. To date, no single theory predominates.


In addition to prodromal depression in pancreatic cancer, there is some
evidence of depression as a first or early symptom in lung cancer (Hughes,
1985) and head and neck cancer (Davies, Davies, &amp; Delpo, 1986).

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00235&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is a large and complex literature on the psychological and psychopharmacological
treatment of cancer-related disorders. As this is covered
elsewhere in this volume (Chapter 15), the material will not be presented here.


<b>Diabetes Mellitus</b>


Diabetes is a complex disease with interrelated metabolic and vascular
components. Metabolically, the diabetic patient suffers from hyperglycemia
(high blood sugar) due to absent or diminished insulin secretion or ineffective
insulin action. The vascular component consists of small vessel changes
(leading to retinopathy and nephropathy) and large vessel changes (leading to
cerebral vascular accidents, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular
disease.) Neuropathy is also fairly common in the older diabetic population.
Diabetes is typically divided into Type I (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
or IDDM) and Type II (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM).


Diabetic treatment consists of four interrelated components: diet; exercise;
oral hypoglycemic agents such as glyburide-Micronase and glipizide-Glucatrol;
and insulin. Management is complex (particularly when insulin is used),
requiring carefully timed and regulated behaviors of eating, exercising, blood
sugar monitoring, and medication administration. Emotional states can also
affect blood sugar levels, with severe or intermittent stress upsetting a previously
established balanced regimen. Recent evidence (Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial Research Group, 1993) suggests that good control of
blood sugar levels can reduce the vascular sequelae of diabetes in the insulindependent
type.


NIDDM is the most prevalent form of the disease in older populations, with
prevalence rates of 20% in persons aged 65 to 74 years (Davidson, 1990) and
estimated rates at close to 40% in persons over age 80 years (Morley &amp; Kaiser,
1990). Most research on diabetes mellitus has been done with IDDM patients,
however, leaving the mechanisms and treatments for NIDDM less well
understood.


Several researchers have investigated the role of emotions in diabetes
mellitus. Using a Diagnostic Interview Schedule, Lustman, Griffith, Clouse,
and Cryer (1986) estimated a lifetime prevalence of major depression among
114 insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetics at 32.5% and
point prevalence rates at 14%. There were no differences in rates of depression
between the IDDM and NIDDM patients. Geringer, Perlmuter, Stern, and
Nathan (1988) reported depression rates (based on a Zung Self-Rated Depression
Scale) of 19% among NIDDM females. Five-year prevalence has been
estimated at 17.7% (Robinson, Fuller, &amp; Edmeades, 1988). Among diabetic
patients applying for pancreatic transplants, Popkin, Callies, Lentz, Colon,

Can diabetes first appear as depression? Goldberg, Andres, and Bierman
(1990) make the case that diabetes presents a different picture in the elderly
than in younger patients. Whereas a younger patient will more often be
diagnosed on the basis of hyperglycemia, an older patient is more likely to
present degenerative changes in blood vessels and nerves that lead to atherosclerotic
complications, neuropathy, renal failure, and retinopathy. The onset
is gradual and resembles age-related physiological changes. Zimmerman
(1990) notes that NIDDM frequently is diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient
during routine testing or as part of an evaluation for other medical problems.


Of most interest to the mental health clinician is the fact that the presenting
symptoms may be fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Lustman et al. (1986)
report loss of energy and difficulty concentrating to be common symptoms in
diabetics with poor metabolic control. Perlmuter, Goldfinger, Shore, and
Nathan (1990) summarize recent research on cognitive function in NIDDM,
reporting that NIDDM is associated with poorer performance than age
matched controls on memory tasks among depressed diabetics. After controlling
for depression, NIDDM subjects still perform more poorly than controls
on more complex tasks, such as serial learning, digit symbol, and problem
solving.


Thus, the mental health clinician should be sensitive to the presentation of
depression in an older patient with a family history of diabetes; personal
history of gestational diabetes with weight loss, fatigue, and concentration
difficulties; or both. Medical symptoms include blurred vision, frequent
urination (polyuria), and unusual thirst (polydipsia), although these are more
often present in IDDM than in NIDDM. Obesity is a factor in 80% of older
patients with NIDDM. Mental health clinicians who are treating diabetic
patients receiving medication should also be aware that acute anxiety accompanied
by dizziness, sweating, shakiness, and confusion or mental status
changes may signal hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) secondary to treatment;
referral for medication evaluation is warranted if such episodes occur, and
especially if they are recurring at the same time each day.


Little has been published about the etiology of depression in diabetes.
Lustman et al. (1986) posit that depression can either cause or be caused by
poor glucose control. Psychiatric illness is associated with poor long-term

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00237&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The primary focus in the literature has been on depression as a reactive
phenomenon in relation to diagnosis, lifestyle changes, control issues, and
physical complications such as impotence and blindness. Because careful
compliance with a difficult regimen can so dramatically affect outcome, it is
particularly useful in this chronic disease for physical and mental health
practitioners to work closely together to maximize the patient's ability and
willingness to maintain metabolic control.


<b>Other Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders</b>


Diabetes mellitus illustrates the complexity of the neuroendocrine systems.
Other examples that will be considered in this section include the disorders
associated with thyroxine, cortisol, and calcium abnormalities. Each of these
abnormalities has been shown to have affective or cognitive concomitants or
both. In each case, the psychological disturbance may be the only evidence of
disorder, and the disturbance is usually rapidly reversed with appropriate
biological therapy. The frequency of these abnormalities increases with age,
and the geriatric mental health practitioner should be especially alert to, and
ready to refer for, endocrine-metabolic screening.


Geriatric mental health practitioners can find a detailed description of
endocrine function in Gottlieb and Greenspan (1989). They describe the two
primary neuroendocrine feedback loops: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis (HPAA) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPTA). In a simplified
explanation, input to the brain influences the hypothalamus, which
controls the secretion of pituitary hormones. The pituitary, in turn, controls
the levels of cortisol and thyroid hormones from the adrenal and thyroid
glands, respectively. Through a series of fast-acting and slow-acting feedback
loops, the body attempts to keep circulating hormone levels in a delicate
balance. Dysregulation of either the HPAA or HPTA can occur at any point
within the web of feedback loops.


Hall, Gardner, and Popkin (1981) found that 46% of psychiatric inpatient
subjects and 9% of their psychiatric outpatient subjects had physical disorders
that directly contributed to the presentation of psychiatric disorders. In both

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

THYROID DISORDERS


As is suggested by the prevalence studies mentioned, hypothyroidism
frequently presents depressive signs and symptoms: sadness, disinterest, sleep
disturbance, fatigue, psychomotor slowing, decreased appetite and libido, and
poor concentration. Although constipation and psychomotor retardation may
mimic the vegetative signs of depression, weight gain in the absence of
increased food intake is unusual in depression and may provide a useful clue
in distinguishing the disorders. Often, however, there are no additional physical
signs of illness. Gregerman (1990) notes that two thirds of hypothyroid
cases in the elderly present nothing more than debilitation and apathy. He
states, "The most difficult step in diagnosis is the simple clinical appreciation
of the possibility that the patient may be hypothyroid" (p. 726). Laboratory
studies provide confirmation.


Gottlieb and Greenspan (1989) describe a grading system for hypothyroidism.
Grade I, or overt hypothyroidism, is the most severe form, defined by abnormally
low levels of circulating thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). In the intermediate form
of hypothyroidism (Grade II), T4 may be in the normal range, but serum thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated. In the least severe form (Grade III), serum
levels of T3, T4, TSH, and the free T4 index are all within normal limits. However,
on testing, the patient shows pituitary supersensitivity to exogenous administration
of thyrotropin releasing hormone. Gottlieb and Greenspan maintain that the
more severe the thyroid dysfunction (Grade I), the more direct the etiological
pathway to depression. This depression may remit entirely with thyroid replacement
alone. In contrast, depression associated with Grade III hypothyroidism
probably requires administration of both thyroid replacement and antidepressant
medications to relieve depressive symptoms.

Hyperthyroidism, which many associate with an almost maniclike state in
younger patients, can have a different presentation in the elderly. Gregerman
(1990) reports that "nervousness" (restlessness, irritability, and tremor) is
almost universally reported by young patients but by less than 50% of the
elderly. Younger patients typically report increased appetite, whereas only
10% of elderly patients report this; indeed, 30% of older patients report
anorexia and weight loss. Elderly patients may be more likely than younger
patients to report heart palpitations or a racing sensation.


The term <i>apathetic hyperthyroidism</i> describes a particular presentation seen
mainly in the elderly. The essential features are depression, marked by disinterest
and apathy; blunted or depressed affect or both; and slowed mentation.


Gottlieb and Greenspan (1989) note that hyperthyroidism in the elderly may
be treated with antithyroid drugs, partial thyroidectomy or with radioactive
iodine therapy. Achieving thyroid balance improves or eliminates psychiatric
symptoms in most cases.


CORTISOL DISORDERS


Cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands, is involved in serotonin
production and brain glucose metabolism. Indirectly, it is involved with
electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Although disorders of the adrenal
glands are relatively rare, Terry and Halter (1990) caution as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
Many of the clinical problems seen in elderly people could be manifestations of
adrenal disease. These range from hypertension and diabetes mellitus associated
with overproduction of glucocorticoids to weight loss, fatigue, and hypotension
that are manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. Thus it is important to keep
adrenal disorders in mind when evaluating elderly patients who present with these
problems, (p. 716)

</blockquote>
The following is extracted from Gottlieb and Greenspan's (1989) discussion
of cortisol abnormalities:


Many of the clinical problems seen in elderly people could be manifestations of
adrenal disease. These range from hypertension and diabetes mellitus associated
with overproduction of glucocorticoids to weight loss, fatigue, and hypotension
that are manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. Thus it is important to keep
adrenal disorders in mind when evaluating elderly patients who present with these
problems, (p. 716)


<i>Hypocortisolism</i> (Addison's disease) is a state of underproduction of the
corticosteroids. Sixty percent to 90% of patients evidence psychiatric symptoms--
primarily apathy, fatigue, sadness, negativism, irritability, poverty of
thought content, and anorexia. Treatment with replacement corticosteroids
generally reverses the psychopathological symptoms.


<i>Hypercortisolism</i> (Cushing's syndrome) is defined by high blood levels of
cortisol, which could result from several different sources. Fifty percent to
90% of Cushing's syndrome patients evidence psychological manifestations,
most of which precede any physical manifestation. There is no single psychological

CALCIUM DISORDERS


The regulation of serum calcium levels involves a complex interaction of the
endocrine system (primarily parathyroid hormone) and calcitonin (a peptide
produced by the thyroid gland), bone metabolism, intestine and kidney function,
and vitamin D. Serum calcium regulation is essential for secretory cell function,
including neuronal function. Therefore, dysregulation of serum calcium may
manifest as psychological disturbance. Dysregulation can result from hyperparathyroidism
or hypoparathyroidism, Paget's disease, excess Vitamin D intake,
thiazide diuretic use, and malignancy. Malignancy may be a more common
etiology of hypercalcemia in the elderly. There is an increasing frequency of
disorders of calcium metabolism with advancing age (Raisz, 1990).


Hypercalcemia has been shown to be associated with psychological disturbance
in about 50% of cases, with the type and degree of disturbance varying
with disease intensity (Gottlieb &amp; Greenspan, 1989). In mild cases, the patient
may complain only of weakness or becoming easily fatigued (Lyles, 1990),
whereas in moderate cases, anorexia, weakness, apathy, suicidal tendencies
and mild cognitive impairment may mimic major depression. Severe cases,
which may be associated with malignancy, can present with mental status
changes, including acute psychosis and delirium. Short-term therapy, consisting
of decreasing serum calcium levels (usually through hydration), can
rapidly reverse psychological disturbances.


Hypocalcemia may also manifest as psychological disturbance in over 50% of
cases, with the most prominent symptoms being severe depression, anxiety,
fatigue, irritability, emotional lability, phobia, and social withdrawal. Cognitive
impairment, dementia, and delirium are also common presentations. Most symptoms
will remit rapidly with calcium ion replacement, although dementia of long
standing may not show improvement (Gottlieb &amp; Greenspan, 1989).


<b>Conclusion</b>


This chapter has attempted to look at a number of medical conditions in the
elderly that are likely to have associated mental health conditions. The goal

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although the literature of the past decade has dramatically increased in the
areas of health psychology, behavioral medicine, psychosomatic medicine,
and geriatric psychiatry, the investigative work has just begun on the interface
of medicine and mental health. Clearly needed are disease-specific studies
that use sophisticated methodology to identify the prevalence, incidence,
etiology, course, and treatment for mental health symptomatology within the
framework of each of the common chronic diseases. In addition, studies are
needed among the very old and frail who are frequently suffering from
multiple chronic disease states and their attendant psychological symptoms.
How best to even conceptualize, let alone identify and treat, these intricately
comorbid conditions?


With health care cost and use issues coming to the fore, there will be added
incentive to consider the psychological factors in medical disease that could
be exacerbating cost and use problems. In addition to cost-effective care,
quality care is far more probable when mental health and medical professionals
are working closely together. In a close collaboration, each can contribute
his or her expertise to difficult diagnostic problems, treatment planning, and
monitoring of both somatic and nonsomatic treatments. Driven by both cost
and quality considerations, we may hope to see the emergence of medical-mental
health teams in the primary care of geriatric patients.
