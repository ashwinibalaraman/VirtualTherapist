SOON, OUT OF SHEER DESPERATION, I began to look for help
outside official medical circles. I was willing to try anything
to regain my health.


A man who called himself a "hygienist" prescribed a
quart of carrot juice every day. This, he promised, would
clear up my "nervous condition" in a few weeks. I bought
an electric juicer, and drank carrot juice for three months.
Nothing improved but my complexion, which turned a
lovely shade of orange that didn&apos;t fade for weeks.


Then a food faddist suggested I try fasting, and directed
me to some material on the subject. I had always
supposed fasting was a religious rite, but my friend suggested
it was a sound way of emptying the body of accumulated
toxins. It seemed dangerous to me. But again,
I was willing to try anything. I had been out of the sanitarium
for six months and I was as sick as ever, too sick to
continue my job.


So I packed my bags and went South to another
sanitarium. Its promotional literature promised that fasting

I had enough sense to observe that many of the other
patients, who had fasted themselves down to skeletons
to cure purely physical ailments, were becoming increasingly
disturbed as their fasts progressed. In fact, a number
of them, after fasts of fifteen or thirty days, had cracked
up completely and were restored to sanity only after the
resumption of eating. If fasting triggered a psychosis in
normal persons, I asked the naturopath, how the devil
would it make a psychotic sane? He smiled and told me
not to worry. Later, rummaging through his library, I
came across a book by an eminent authority on fasting who
claimed that "it was nothing short of criminal" to place
mental patients on prolonged fasts, precisely because it
would trigger a psychosis. I broke my fast, paid off the
naturopath and made a hurried departure.


I returned to Minnesota and my parentsâ€™ home a total
physical and mental wreck. For a couple of months I hid
in my old bedroom, my mind assailed by a variety of
terrors, trembling at the prospect of venturing forth beyond
the front door, a stranger in my own house. I would
lie on the bed studying the walls and the photographs of

My mother and father and my relatives tried hard to
cheer me up. They have always been a very affectionate
and loyal family, all of them, and they made every effort to
get me functioning again. This was a new and difficult
experience for my parents, because I had never been
seriously ill before. Neither my mother nor my father understood
the illness any better than Laurie, my doctors, or
myself.


My parents were greatly distressed by the break-up
of my marriage, having been extremely fond of Laurie.
Very shortly we received news that Laurie had filed for a
divorce. I was not surprised. Her decision was inevitable.
My illness had drained her emotionally, had jeopardized
her own health. She herself was now under psychoanalysis.
Moreover, the sanitarium doctors had told her that the
prospects for my recovery were not good. Together again,
our illnesses would only be aggravated.


At this point I was quite resigned to doing myself in.
But my parents, I knew, needed me. If I killed myself, I
would be killing them. I was certain of that. So again I
began to hunt for a way out.

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A friend of the family who happened by one day
recommended that I try following a vegetarian diet. He
persuaded me to cut out meat altogether and subsist on a
vegetable and fruit diet. Curiously, the results were immediate.
Many of my symptoms vanished within a few
days. The deep depression and anxiety also passed away.


I cannot account for this improvement. Is it possible
that, because of some genetic deficiency, the schizophrenic
does not have the biochemical equipment to metabolize
meat protein? Is it possible that there is something to the
old saw that one man&apos;s meat is another man&apos;s poison? Is it
possible that in schizophrenia, as in diabetes, there is a relationship
between diet and the illness? (A prominent psychiatric
researcher later wrote me as follows regarding this
theory: "Although the scientific evidence for the thesis is,
as you know, extremely meager, I cannot exclude the possibility
that there may be a basis for your surmise. Certain
amino acids may affect mental state and a low protein diet,
such as would be achieved with vegetables, might conceivably
reduce the levels of certain amino acids and
could possibly result in mental changes.")


The improvement was temporary, however. Within
a couple of months, the illness was upon me again. The
vegetarian diet had helped, but something was missing.
Something important.


Unable to work, paralyzed again by severe depression
and anxiety, suicidal and homicidal, I voluntarily committed
myself to the nearby Veterans Administration Hospital.
It was just like the expensive private sanitarium they
had taken me to first--without the weekly bills. Except

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In group therapy sessions, they looked you over with
clinical eyes while the patients, in an orgy of self-examination,
chopped each other up in little pieces. A thousand
questions were asked and a thousand questions went unanswered
as the patients struggled valiantly to comprehend
and deal with the catastrophe that had befallen them.
Each day the room would be filled with a mishmash of
philosophical and psychiatric ideas, each one contradicting
the other, so that in the end a patient did not know
what to believe or what to do to improve his health. As a
result, most stayed sick or, if they improved, often relapsed.
I could see no merit in group therapy, except perhaps the
fact that a psychoanalyst could promote more confusion
and ill-will among patients with less time and effort than
was possible in individual therapy.


Curiously, the staff discouraged the discussion of
religion among the patients. At one time <i>I</i> incurred the
displeasure of my analyst when he learned that I had
sought out the hospital chaplain. The chaplain, a cleareyed,

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had a few brief talks with the minister, who confided
in me that, oddly, he was welcome on all wards except the
psychiatric wards, where he felt he was most needed. I
liked this man, and poured out my soul to him. I told him
that I had been unable to find either a cause, a meaning
or a solution to my illness.


"I&apos;ve tried to understand it," I wept, "but I can&apos;t. It
doesn&apos;t make sense. None of it. Before I started getting
sick, I had everything. I had ..."


"Did you have faith?" he interrupted me.


"No," I said. "I guess not."


"Then you didn&apos;t have anything."


I soon learned that the minister was a great admirer
of the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung. He reminded me that
Jung had once claimed that all of his patients had got sick
because they had lost what the great religions had given
them, and had only been restored to health after they had
recaptured the religious spirit. The chaplain was very
gentle with me, and he tried to interest me in the religion
of my grandfather.


My analyst reacted sharply when he heard of my contact
with the chaplain. He was a long-faced, sour little
man with a yellowish complexion, greatly disliked by the

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Religion, he informed me, was a "defense mechanism"
and atonement was a "reaction formation." I was trying to
escape my problems through religion. And repeatedly he
would flatly declare that I was sick because I was too <i>good</i>
and <i>too moral</i>.


Once, enraged by his sustained assault on me, I
wanted to strangle the man, but again, something held me
back.


After this incident, I put in a formal request to the
staff, informing them that I was not getting along with my
analyst and that he was making me sicker. I asked that I
not be required to see him any longer, and that, instead,
I be allowed to see the chaplain now and then. My request
was refused. (To a more legal mind than mine, this may
raise the interesting question as to whether my constitutional
rights to freedom of religion were violated.)


I was discharged from the VA hospital six months

[p. <i>204</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653212-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have no answers, and am weary of looking for one.
I tremble at the thought of the future and perhaps years
spent rotting in sanitariums and institutions until one day
death is kind enough to intervene. I long to feel like a
normal human being again. I hunger for the friendships of
old. Sometimes I have had dreams in which Laurie and I
were together again, healthy and happy again, only to
waken to the nightmare of my present condition. It is then
that I tell myself that the only way I can now show my
love for her is by staying away from her. For I am dead
to her as well as being dead to myself.


I have tried everything to regain my health, and now
there is nothing else to try. It&apos;s a struggle to get through
each day without blowing my brains out. And when I
think about that, I think what a final irony it would be for
a man who loves life as much as I have loved it to die by
his own hands, his own executioner. But maybe Heming-way
