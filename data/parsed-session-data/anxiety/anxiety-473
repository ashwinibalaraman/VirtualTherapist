BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah, good vacation.
<b>PT:</b> Is it still on?
<b>DR:</b> It was too short.  Oh yeah, it's on.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> It don't matter what we talk about.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  
<b>DR:</b> How are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Good, I had a bad month last month, you know, when [INAUDIBLE] in May of last year, [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE] forty five days, forty five days when you fill out your CA1.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, well I got paid, my case got denied in May of last year but then I sent it for an oral hearing and then in May of this year it got approved.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Well the bills didn't stop coming from [DEIDENTIFIED] and I contacted, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED], May, June, July, you know, [NAME OTHER] is going to take care of it, she'll contact [NAME OTHER], blah, blah, blah.  Well then in August, I get a final notice that they're going to send me to a collection agency, a federal collection agency unless this $4100 is paid back.
<b>DR:</b> Paid back to who?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] to the post office but see they're still thinking my case is denied.  Nobody in [DEIDENTIFIED] has bothered contacting them to tell them my case was approved so I contacted [NAME OTHER], the supervisor who sent me the letter and I explained, a very nice man, I explained everything and he said [PATIENT NAME], I can't go on just what you're telling me, I need proof.  
<b>DR:</b> Well that [INAUDIBLE] paper, you know that right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah
<b>DR:</b> That proves everything.
<b>PT:</b> But it had to come from the post office, it's called a 2240 form saying cancel out these bills, so he said and you've been approved since May and I said yes, you know, and I keep track of everything I do, right, so I said would you be willing to do a three way to talk to [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, my claims adjuster, he said yeah.  So I had got her on the phone and [PHYSICIAN NAME], he ripped her apart, you know, he's like why would you do this to this young lady, this case has been sitting there approved since May and nobody bothered down there to contact us and now here she's going to maybe go to collections if we can't, you know, this adjusted within thirty days and just ripped her apart.  So the lady has [DEIDENTIFIED] that is supposed to have sent in the 2240.  [NAME OTHER] called and her she's like, well I threatened to sue them, I said let me tell you something, you know, I've had no credit cards, no nothing for seven years, you know, so my credit is almost like perfect, I owe on my house and then we just bought this Kia, I said I don't want no harassment of these collections, I heard they can get [INAUDIBLE], you know, calling you all hours of the nights and sending you threatening letters, I said [NAME OTHER], I don't need that but I didn't get loud verbally, you know, angry, I stayed very calm when I was talking to them but then I had to double up like on my Xanax, you know, because I was having the attacks and stuff but anyway, you know, so [NAME OTHER] calls me back and she said oh I just got off the phone with [NAME OTHER] and I said well why didn't you send in this paperwork?  You know what her comment was?  I just didn't bother to do it.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Let me tell you, that lady I wasn't nice to when I called her.  I said, you know, you're screwing with my life [NAME OTHER].  Oh she is a bitch, I know she is a bitch, excuse me but I told her you're dealing with, you know, my life here.  I'm going to be the one who's being harassed by these collection people and then it's going to be on my credit report, you know, and I said, you know, you didn't want to bother doing it so I typed a really nice complaint letter for [NAME OTHER] who's like, he's the vice president of the [DEIDENTIFIED] and I explained everything to him, you know, how my [INAUDIBLE] was refused by my supervisor which is against the law, how [NAME OTHER] sent me a resignation form and then the investigator interview, remember saying they weren't getting all my medical documentation from you all to cover my [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Which we were.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, and you know, like I told him, all the woman had to do is pick up the phone and use her common sense like my husband did, called the medical unit and say do you have medical documentation covering my absences from [PHYSICIAN NAME], oh yeah, you're all up to date, you know, yeah, I said but no, I said I think the lady likes screwing with people's lives.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> The resignation form that I didn't ask for, the investigative interview which was totally uncalled for which I had to go to the hospital when I got back because I was shaking, my blood pressure was 200/170
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know and I said, and now she don't want to be bothered to send the 2240's, I said well maybe I suggest you take her out of that position because I know for a fact I'm not the only person she's done this to.   Then on and off from the 14th through the 23rd, my husband and I were on the phone Monday through Friday, 46 hours as day straightening this shit out and I shouldn't have had to do anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> But you know
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad you got it though
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they got it, they stopped the collections, I'm not going to collections and then another thing, when my case got approved, I could go back and claim OWCP and get off of my OPM retirement which is like $2000 more a month for pay.
<b>DR:</b> That's a lot.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't do that yet?
<b>PT:</b> In June.  We've been going, I sent it in
<b>DR:</b> I have another guy who's having trouble with that.
<b>PT:</b> You did it wrong, okay, how do you need me to do it?  Well, I can't tell you.  I said well how did I do it wrong and then you're going to call me [NAME OTHER] and then you can't tell me how I've got to do the paperwork right?  So then I just checked this, did this, checked this, and I sent in like six copies, I said well maybe one of these are right.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean it's been since June, you know, and it's just like they just want to frustrate, oh and another thing, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] requested a heater for my backyard pool to do therapy for my, you know, shoulders and my carpal tunnel, so you know, they didn't get an answer so I contacted a congresswoman because, you know, last time it was [NAME OTHER], he's the one
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That got my case approved.
<b>DR:</b> Now who is it?
<b>PT:</b> Her name is [NAME OTHER]
<b>DR:</b> Yeah,  [NAME OTHER]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, okay, so I contacted her office.  Well, I got a letter from them saying they contacted, you know, the department of labor and they said they didn't receive the letter from [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] requesting it which is a lie because I get all signed receipts.  I said okay, I'll have him send it again so then he sends it in, then about two weeks ago, I get a letter going we didn't get your three estimates on the heater, you know, which is a lie because then I got my signed receipt that said they received it, I mailed it [DATE], they received it in their office by [NAME OTHER] on [DATE].  So now I wrote my congresswoman and I said when you contacted them, did they tell you anything about they didn't get my estimates, you know, and now they're saying, first it was they didn't get the doctor thing, now they're saying they didn't get the estimates and I said, you know, are they just screwing me around here or what.  
<b>DR:</b> They are.
<b>PT:</b> It's been very stressful but, you know, I think the medication you had me on just kept me very calm.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think the Lamictal has done great, you know.
<b>PT:</b> I mean normally I would be
<b>DR:</b> No ups or downs
<b>PT:</b> A huge son of a bitch, you know, this is bullshit, I mean I would, I honestly would, I would cuss you out like a sailor, you know, and I would get pissed off and angry but I didn't, I didn't raise my voice and I've told myself it's not worth it too, you know what I'm saying?
<b>DR:</b> Well that's true.
<b>PT:</b> It's not worth getting that upset
<b>DR:</b> Especially with your blood pressure
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, making myself, just like my daughter, bless her heart, she's backing in her Ultimata, her brand new Ultimata out of the garage, she hit the car next to it, her roommate's car, ripped her bumper completely off and, you know, when she called, she goes you know mom I just wrecked my car.  Well, I'm thinking, you know, you're out, oh my God are you hurt, you know, the other person, no mom I was backing out of the driveway and she said to me, she said but you know, it's not worth getting upset over, it's just a material thing right?  And that's what I tell her and that's what I tell myself, you know
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It's not worth it, I'm not going to let those people effect my health, you know, they've got me to where I am now in this position, you know, where I had to take the disability retirement, file for the social security, you know, disability, you know, they got me that far and I allowed it, not anymore.
<b>DR:</b> Are you still taking the Lexapro too?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.  Is that for blood pressure, wait a minute
<b>DR:</b> No, that's the antidepressant.
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> We've got Lamictal
<b>PT:</b> No, no, that's all I take, 450 mg
<b>DR:</b> That's okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then I take the blood pressure which I can't remember the name, I'm sorry, and then I have my Xanax when necessary.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I only do that if I feel my chest getting real tight, you know, and I have a little trouble breathing or I start getting, you know, my sweats.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're doing a lot better.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yes.
<b>DR:</b> We're not going to abandon this medicine, it works good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and, you know, like with now I'm coming off of OPM retirement disability and I'm going to have, you know, department of labor and, you know, I was told by [NAME OTHER] that I could probably get sent to a doctor every six months.
<b>DR:</b> Well they could do it every twelve months and they really don't do that but I think there's a good chance as you, because you're coming off of one and going to the other, they might do it.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and what am I going to tell the doctor, sure I feel better, I haven't been in that place in almost a year and a half but do they still stress me out, hell yeah, I still have anxiety, you know, I had to go to the hospital one time because, you know, I get
<b>DR:</b> Well, they continue to harass you is why.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes, yeah, but I figure, you know, 2000 and then it's tax free.  Yeah, they'll give me like 33 plus a month.  We're only right now with OPM, they just knocked me down to 40% so when all is said and done, I get like 952 bucks.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, for all the time you worked there but the trouble is, OWCP can harass you more.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah and then
<b>DR:</b> But you can always go back if you had to
<b>PT:</b> Oh absolutely, yeah, uh-huh, that's what [NAME OTHER] said too.  I thought yeah, I'll get some money out of them, I don't care but, yeah, I think the medicine, even my husband said that, you know, he can really tell the medicine is helping because you were very calm, you know, on the phone where normally I'd be, you know, especially [NAME OTHER] I would be like screaming at her, you know
<b>DR:</b> But see that's just what she wants.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah, but you know I just said, well what do you mean you didn't want to be bothered doing this [NAME OTHER], that's your job, you know, you're screwing with my life here but I did threaten, like I said, if I go to collections, I will get a lawyer and I will sue you [NAME OTHER], I will sue [NAME OTHER] and I will sue the post office, you know, for total harassment and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, negligence.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, but I could tell the, you know, that's what I told my husband because usually I'd be flying up and down, you know, like one minute I'd be just oh, you know, my husband could just like blink at me and I would be like stop, you know, and stuff like that and now it's just like, I don't know if it's just mentally I've told myself it ain't worth it.
<b>DR:</b> Well the medicine makes you able to mentally tell yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> You've still got to do your part, yeah, you know.
<b>PT:</b> I still find times where I'm sitting there, you know, and I'm like in la la land or just don't feel like I want to smile and I'm usually a bubbly person, you know, with a smile all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Well maybe
<b>PT:</b> So it's up and down still
<b>DR:</b> A little of that but
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, not much, not like it was.  I mean, you know, I would sit there and go like thoughts of suicide and I have, you know, not been doing that anymore and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> No homicide, no suicide?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, really, because I watch lifetime and, you know, the man is always the bad guy and the woman is always, you know, the good person and my husband, bless his heart, he'll sit there and watch them with me, you know, and then he'll like, this one was on the other day, this [NAME OTHER], she was like, you know, twenty years younger than her multimillionaire husband and she ends up killing him, you know, and has an affair with his son and, you know, so he's going around calling me [NAME OTHER] and I told him you better be careful, she cut her husband.  He was like oh, you know.
<b>DR:</b> All right, things are working out finally.
<b>PT:</b> It is, it's really doing good and like I said, I can cope, I can tell the difference with this medicine that I can cope.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I'm not flying off the handle and I'm calm and, you know, I still get the anxiety attacks over it which I feel calm but I still get that, the tightness of the chest and then the sweating and I just take, you know, my Xanax and I'm okay but I don't know if it's just subconsciously it's back there and try to tell it not
<b>DR:</b> Well it's actually two different systems in your brain that's the trouble and the Lamictal is not real good for panic attacks, that's the trouble.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So if you're only having them once in a while, you just do what you're doing with the Xanax.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oh yeah, just when things like this happen, you know.
<b>DR:</b> If I wanted to try to prevent the panic attacks, we'd have to put the Lexapro back.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> That's sort of a preventative of that.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I may take that
<b>DR:</b> Just go like this
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and then I 
<b>DR:</b> I mean you shouldn't have to deal with them too much anymore.
<b>PT:</b> I hope not and if I do, I do, and my husband has been real supportive.  He's, you know, I always let them now that my husband is, you know, we're on speaker and he's there and, you know, he might ask something that I have forgotten and, you know, he's taking notes and things too because I get
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I talked to so and so at this time on this date, this is what she said or if I make calls, you know, who am I speaking too, so I got all that covered, all that covered.
<b>DR:</b> Well good because there's so damn inefficient.
<b>PT:</b> Oh they're, and then you know you've got to send the same paperwork over and over and over and over and it's like
<b>DR:</b> That's been going on since I've been dealing with them
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Twenty five, thirty years.
<b>PT:</b> And you know, a lot of people give up but they got me to where I am so
<b>DR:</b> All right, all right.
