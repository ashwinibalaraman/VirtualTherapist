<b>Description of the Disorder</b>
[p. <i>249</i>]

Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric
disorder that has a broad impact on all
aspects of personal, social, and vocational
functioning. Because of the disabling nature
of schizophrenia, it can have a major effect
on the ability to work, including the ability
to secure and sustain long-term employment,
and to manage social relationships at
the workplace. In this chapter, we provide
an introduction to schizophrenia and
related disorders, and we consider implications
of the illness for employers, employees
with the illness, their coworkers, and the
workplace environment. We discuss the
broad treatment needs of individuals with
schizophrenia and address principles for
assessing these needs in the context of work.
We describe an approach to helping clients
with schizophrenia succeed in competitive
jobs in the community, the Individual
Placement and Support model of supported
employment; review the research supporting
this model; and address common workplace
accommodations for people with this disorder.
We conclude by discussing strategies
for maintaining successful employment in
clients with schizophrenia, and for minimizing
the relapses or the negative effects of
relapses.


Schizophrenia is a major mental illness
that can affect all aspects of functioning.
The psychopathology of schizophrenia is
characterized by three clusters of symptoms
(Liddle, 1987; Mueser, Curran, &amp; McHugo,
1997): positive symptoms, negative symptoms,
and cognitive impairment. <i>Positive
symptoms</i> (or <i>psychotic symptoms</i>) refer to
hallucinations (i.e., false perceptions, such
as hearing voices when no one is around);
delusions (i.e., false beliefs, such as believing
that your coworkers are plotting against
you); and bizarre behavior (e.g., collecting
odd scraps of paper). <i>Negative symptoms</i>
are symptoms characterized by deficits in
emotional experience, behavioral expressiveness,
and energy level. Common
negative symptoms include <i>anhedonia</i>
(diminished experience of pleasure), <i>asocialty</i>
(reduced social drive), <i>anergia</i> (decreased
ability to initiate and follow through with
plans), <i>alogia</i> (poverty of speech or content
of speech), and <i>blunted affect</i> (diminished

[p. <i>250</i>]

The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia
emphasize the presence of positive and
negative symptoms (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994), although there is growing
evidence that cognitive impairment is
extremely common (Green &amp; Nuechterlein,
1999). Typically, the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia are episodic, with severity
fluctuating over time, although 25% to
40% of clients experience these symptoms
persistently (Carpenter &amp; Buchanan, 1994;
Silverstein &amp; Harrow, 1978). Negative
symptoms, in contrast, tend to be more
stable and more pervasive, and few clients
experience full remission of these symptoms
between episodes of psychosis (Mueser,
Douglas, Bellack, &amp; Morrison, 1991). The
cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia tend
to persist throughout the course of the illness,
although their severity also increases
during exacerbation of positive symptoms.


In addition to the characteristic symptoms
of schizophrenia, diagnostic criteria
also require impairment in psychosocial
functioning in major role functioning
(worker, student, parent, spouse); maintenance
of good interpersonal relationships;
care of oneself; and enjoyment of leisure
activities. In addition to the characteristic
symptoms and impairments, the diagnosis
of schizophrenia requires a 6-month period
of impaired functioning. Therefore, at least
some chronicity is incorporated into the
definition of the disorder. Because some
impairment in functioning is required for
the diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is tautological
to say that the disorder affects functioning.
However, it should also be noted
that for many clients, problems in role
functioning long preceded the onset of the
illness (Zigler &amp; Click, 1986), which then
exacerbated a preexisting impairment.


Schizophrenia is closely related to three
other disorders: schizoaffective disorder,
schizopheniform disorder, and schizotypal
personality disorder. Based on studies of
mental illness in families and response to
treatment, these disorders are grouped
together as <i>schizophrenia-spectrum disorders</i>
and are treated following the same principles.
Individuals who meet the symptom and
impaired functioning criteria for the disorder,
but whose impairment is less than 6 months'
duration (or who experience a full remission
of symptoms with episodes lasting less than
6 months), meet diagnostic criteria for
<i>schizopheniform disorder</i>. Individuals who
meet criteria for schizophrenia during periods
when their mood is normal, but who also
have significant episodes of depression or
mania, meet diagnostic criteria for <i>schizoaffective
disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder</i>
resembles schizophrenia in many ways,
although the severity of symptoms tends to
be lower, and its course is less episodic and
marked by less flagrant positive symptoms.


Because schizophrenia affects so many
different areas of functioning, it is not surprising
that many other comorbid disorders
and problems are associated with the illness.
Substance abuse and dependence are
very common in clients with schizophrenia,
with lifetime rates of approximately 50%
and recent rates of abuse or dependence of
25% to 35%; these rates are in considerable
excess of the rate of lifetime substance
use disorder of approximately 16% in the
general population (Mueser, Bennett, &amp;
Kushner, 1995; Regier et al., 1990). Depression
is a very common symptom in schizophrenia,
with most clients experiencing
at least some symptoms of depression
over the course of their illness, and a
lifetime suicide rate of approximately 10%

[p. <i>251</i>]

Many clients are eligible for and receive
entitlements, such as subsidized income,
insurance, and housing, but the symptoms
and impairments that characterize schizophrenia
result in a variety of problems not
solved by these subsidies. Because of the
poverty, social and employment difficulties,
and lack of awareness associated with
the illness, many clients live in substandard
housing or are intermittently homeless
(Drake, Wallach, &amp; Huffman, 1989), and
they suffer from chronic medical conditions
resulting in premature mortality (Tsuang &amp;
Woolson, 1978). Furthermore, with the
high rates of substance abuse and impaired
social judgment, a disproportionate number
of clients are jailed or imprisoned
(Hodgins &amp; Côté, 1993; Teplin, 1983).
Finally, because of the episodic nature of
psychotic symptoms, which may impose a
threat to self or others, clients are frequently
in and out of psychiatric hospitals for the
treatment of acute exacerbations.

<b>Epidemiology</b>

Prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately
1% in the general population, with
relatively stable rates across different
nations. Whereas race and cultural group
do not appear to be related to schizophrenia,
socioeconomic status is, with higher
rates of the disorder found in people living
in poverty (Hollingshead &amp; Redlich, 1958;
Keith, Regier, &amp; Rae, 1991). Historically,
two theories have been advanced to account
for this association. The <i>social drift</i> hypothesis
postulates that the debilitating effects
of schizophrenia on capacity to work result
in a lowering of socioeconomic means,
and, hence, poverty (Aro, Aro, &amp; Keskimäki,
1995). The <i>environmental stress</i> hypothesis
proposes that high levels of stress associated
with poverty precipitate schizophrenia in
some individuals who would not otherwise
develop the illness (Bruce, Takeuchi, &amp;
Leaf, 1991). Both of these explanations may
be partly true, and longitudinal research on
changes in socioeconomic class status and
schizophrenia provide conflicting results.
For example, Fox (1990) reanalyzed data
from several longitudinal studies and found
that after controlling for initial levels of
socioeconomic class, downward drift was
not evident. However, Dohrenwend et al.
(1992) did find evidence for social drift,
even after controlling for socioeconomic
class. Thus, poverty is associated with schizophrenia,
with evidence suggesting both
increased vulnerability to schizophrenia
among people living in poverty, as well as
declining economic standing in people who
develop the illness.

<b>Assessment</b>

Because schizophrenia affects so many
different areas of functioning, assessment is
necessarily broad-based and must cover
both basic psychopathology and associated
impairments, as well as other common
comorbid conditions. Assessment of

[p. <i>252</i>]

A wide range of measures exists for
evaluating functioning in clients with schizophrenia
(Scott &amp; Lehman, 1998). These
instruments evaluate clients' ability to meet
role expectations in a variety of different
areas, including work, school, and parenting,
as well as the quality of social relationships,
self-care and independent living skills,
and leisure and recreational activities.
Assessment of functioning is most accurate
when it incorporates multiple perspectives
(e.g., client, clinician, and family) and
when standardized measures are employed.
Furthermore, the most valuable assessment
information is often obtained when it is conducted
in the setting in which the skills are
to be used. For example, successful employment
interventions incorporate assessment
on the job on an ongoing basis rather than
extensive prevocational testing batteries that
do not generalize to real-world settings
(Bond, 1998; Drake &amp; Becker, 1996).


A great deal of research has been carried
out on the functional assessment of social
skills in people with schizophrenia. Social
skills refer to the individual behavioral
components, such as eye contact, voice
loudness, and the specific choice of words,
which, in combination, are necessary for
effective communication with others
(Mueser &amp; Bellack, 1998). Although not all
problems in social and vocational functioning
are the consequence of poor social skill,
many impairments appear to be related to
skill deficits (Bellack, Morrison, Wixted, &amp;
Mueser, 1990). A number of different strategies
can be used to assess social skill, including
those related to adjustment in the
workplace. Direct interviews with clients
can be a good starting place for identifying
broad areas of social dysfunction; additional
information can be obtained through
role-play tests, naturalistic observations,
and significant others, including employers.


In addition to assessing symptoms and
characteristic impairments of schizophrenia,
routine assessment also needs to take into
account several common comorbid problems
that can have an impact on functioning in the
workplace: substance abuse, depression, and
posttraumatic stress disorder. Substance
abuse is the most common comorbid disorder
in schizophrenia, with approximately 50% of
clients having a lifetime substance use disorder
(abuse or dependence) and 25% to 35%
having an active substance use disorder
(Cuffel, 1996; Regier et al., 1990). Reliable
evaluations of recent substance abuse can be
accomplished by employing the Alcohol Use
Scale and the Drug Use Scale, which are
clinical rating scales that summarize clients'
use of substances over the past 6 months on
5-point ratings scales: 1 = <i>no use</i>, 2 = <i>use
without impairment</i>, 3 = <i>abuse</i>, 4 = <i>dependence</i>,
and 5 = <i>severe dependence with institutionalization</i>
(Mueser, Drake, et al., 1995).


Depression is a very common problem
in people with schizophrenia (Bartels &amp;
Drake, 1989), and suicide occurs in approximately
10% of clients (Caldwell &amp;
Gottesman, 1990; Roy, 1986). Assessment
of depression and suicidality can be conducted
with standardized psychiatric rating
scales (described above), supplemented by

[p. <i>253</i>]

Clients with schizophrenia are more
likely to be exposed to traumatic life events,
in both childhood and adulthood, than
are people in the general population
(Goodman, Rosenberg, Mueser, &amp; Drake,
1997). These high rates of trauma are associated
with correspondingly high rates of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with
most estimates of current PTSD in schizophrenia
ranging between 25% and 35%
(Rosenberg et al., 2001). Reliable assessments
of trauma history and PTSD can be
obtained from clients with schizophrenia
(Mueser et al., 2001) by using rating scales
developed for the general population,
including the Trauma History Question-naire
(Green, 1996), the Revised Conflict
Tactics Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy,
&amp; Sugarman, 1996), the PTSD
Checklist (Blanchard, Jones-Alexander,
Buckley, &amp; Forneris, 1996), and the
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (Blake
et al., 1990).

<b>Impact of Schizophrenia at the Work Place</b>

Schizophrenia can have a major impact on
the ability of people to work, their performance
at work, and their relationships
with coworkers. In this section, we describe
how common symptoms, impairments, and
related problems can influence behavior
and performance in the workplace.
Although we describe possible effects of
symptoms on work functioning, it should
also be noted that many clients with these
symptoms and impairments are capable of
excellent performance on the job, and that
work itself may actually have beneficial
effects on reducing symptom severity (Bell,
Lysaker, &amp; Milstein, 1996). Thus, presence
of symptoms or associated problems should
not be interpreted as a suggestion that specific
problems in work are necessarily likely.


Negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
including anhedonia, apathy, and anergia,
are commonly reflected in the workplace by
a lower level of energy, decreased stamina,
and, at times, a lower motivation to succeed.
Although some people with schizophrenia
work full-time, part-time work is more suitable
for many clients because the overall
effort required is less taxing. Another negative
symptom that can lead to misunder-standings
at the workplace is blunted affect.
People with schizophrenia often lack emotional
expressiveness in their interactions
with others, and frequently, they have flattened
facial expressions and minimal vocal
inflection. These behaviors, which are common
symptoms of schizophrenia, may give
the false impression of not being interested,
concerned, or responsive to what others
have to say, and it can make interacting with
such individuals less rewarding. Despite
their muted expressiveness, clients with
schizophrenia often report the same emotions
as others, leading to misunderstandings
in communication (Blanchard, Mueser, &amp;
Bellack, 1998). Clients with blunted affect
may benefit from learning how to communicate
their interest and feelings to others
through verbal means in order to compensate
for their diminished nonverbal and vocal
expressiveness.


Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia
may affect work performance in a variety of
ways, depending on the tasks required and
the specific nature of the dencits. A common
problem is reduced speed of information

[p. <i>254</i>]

Positive symptoms, including delusions
and hallucinations, occur less frequently,
but when they do, they can easily disrupt
behavior at the workplace. With respect to
delusions, clients may believe that others
are talking about them or plotting against
them, leading to suspicious behavior or
avoidance, resulting in disruptions in relationships
with coworkers and employers.
Hallucinations can be problematic when
clients respond to them publicly, such as
talking back to voices.


Impairments in social skill can have a
significant effect on functioning in the workplace.
Clients may be awkward when interacting
casually with coworkers, responding
to customers, seeking assistance in problem
situations, responding to criticism and negative
feedback from supervisors, or speaking
assertively with others (Mueser, Foy, &amp;
Carter, 1986). These problems can interfere
with a good working milieu and, when the
job involves direct customer interactions,
job performance. Social skill impairments at
the workplace are magnified when clients
have difficulty getting help for difficult
social situations, because their problem-solving
skills also may be limited (Bellack,
Sayers, Mueser, &amp; Bennett, 1994).


The common problem of substance
abuse in schizophrenia can affect work functioning
in a similar fashion as in the general
population. Substance abuse can contribute
to unexplained absences, reduced job
performance because of the effects of substances
or withdrawal, erratic behavior, and
theft. Jobs in which alcohol consumption is
normative socializing behavior among
coworkers after work may be especially
problematic for clients, because evidence
indicates that people with schizophrenia are
more sensitive to experiencing negative consequences
from relatively moderate alcohol
use (Drake &amp; Wallach, 1993; Mueser,
Drake, &amp; Wallach, 1998).


<i>Case Vignette</i>. Alex (a pseudonym;
details of the case have been altered) was a
38-year-old man with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
He had a history of abusing alcohol
and drugs. Alex's work history included
mostly chef positions in gourmet restaurants.
Although Alex was a skillful chef,
working in a restaurant setting was problematic
because it provided him with ready
access to alcohol, frequently contributing to
relapses of alcohol abuse. Alex lost several
of his jobs because he used alcohol at work
and became argumentative with restaurant
staff. His attendance was often erratic
during heavy periods of abuse. Alex was
strongly motivated to work. He stated that
he felt "useless" when he did not have anything
structured to do with his time, and he
liked to spend money on new clothes.


Alex met with an employment specialist
at the mental health center where he was

[p. <i>255</i>]

The employment specialist's work with
Alex enabled him to develop a vocational
plan that supported a sober work life. Over
the course of Alex's employment, he had
a relapse of his substance abuse that
contributed to several absences. Through
support and discussion with his employment
specialist, and ongoing contact between the
employment specialist and the leaders of
the dual disorder group, Alex recognized
the threat that his substance abuse posed to
his continued work, and he decided to stop
using substances. However, because of several
unexplained absences, Alex was placed
on probation in his job by his employer.
After further discussions with the employment
specialist, Alex agreed to allow her to
contact the employer directly so they could
all work together to help Alex succeed in
his job.


The employment specialist approached
the employer to explain the nature of Alex's
psychiatric disability and to describe Alex's
motivation to maintain his job and become
a dependable worker again. The employer
appreciated the employment specialist's
involvement with Alex and stated that he
valued Alex as a worker and wanted to
retain him as an employee. They agreed to
meet weekly while Alex was on probation
to review Alex's performance and to identify
any areas of concern, including any
possible signs of a relapse of his substance
abuse. These follow-up meetings provided
Alex with direct feedback about his work,
bolstered his self-esteem that he was a good
worker, and reduced some of the stress Alex
felt while at work. Alex passed his probationary
period without incident. The
employment specialist stopped meeting
regularly with the employer, but remained
available to him, having approximately
monthly contact. The employment specialist
continued to see Alex regularly, with contacts
averaging weekly to biweekly.

<b>Precipitating Conditions</b>

Schizophrenia is widely considered to be a
biological disorder whose onset and outcome
can be influenced by the environment,
the client's personal coping ability, medications,
and commonly abused substances. A
useful model for conceptualizing the interactions
between biological factors, the environment
(including close relationships), and
the course of schizophrenia is the <i>stressvulnerability
model</i> (Liberman et al., 1986;
Zubin &amp; Spring, 1977). According to this
model, the course and severity of schizophrenia
are determined by the dynamic
interplay between biological vulnerability,
environmental stress, and coping skills.
<i>Biological vulnerability</i> is assumed to be

[p. <i>256</i>]

The stress-vulnerability model has
several implications for understanding possible
factors in the workplace that could
contribute to symptom relapses and a deterioration
in functioning for people with
schizophrenia. Clients with schizophrenia
who work at very demanding jobs, with
substantial expectations on productivity,
time pressure, and rapid change to accommodate
new opportunities, may find the
pace and requirements of the job stressful,
which could increase their risk of relapse.
Jobs requiring flexible work hours, especially
overtime work, extended hours, or
work on little sleep, may induce similar
stress in clients. In addition, if the work
environment is socially stressful, such as
high levels of criticism from supervisors or
tension among coworkers, clients may be at
increased risk of relapse. The problem of
social stress is of particular importance
because clients with schizophrenia often
have poor social perception skills (e.g.,
recognizing facial expressions, taking hints,
interpreting others' motives), resulting in, or
exacerbating, social problems (Penn,
Corrigan, Bentall, Racenstein, &amp; Newman,
1997). Finally, it is possible that stress in
the workplace could contribute to substance
abuse in clients with schizophrenia,
although research documenting such an
effect is lacking.


Although the stress-vulnerability model
suggests that stress in the workplace could
contribute to symptom relapses in schizophrenia,
it also indicates that the experience
of working in a positive environment may
also confer protection against relapses.
Research indicates that meaningful structure
is associated with reduced levels of psychotic
behavior (Rosen, Sussman, Mueser,
Lyons, &amp; Davis, 1981), and social support
has been well-established as a protective factor
against relapses (Buchanan, 1995; Veiel,
1985). Work that provides meaning and
structure to clients may help to create a sense
of purpose, thereby reducing stress. Positive
and supportive social relationships at the
workplace may result in similar benefits.

<b>Course and Prognosis</b>

Onset of schizophrenia typically occurs
between the ages of 16 and 30, with onset
after the age of 35 being relatively rare
(Almeida, Howard, Levy, &amp; David, 1995).
Because schizophrenia usually occurs during
early adulthood, many developmental
tasks are disrupted, including formation of
close interpersonal or dating relationships,
pursuit of higher education, career development,
separation from parents, and identity
formation. It is extremely rare for the first
onset of schizophrenia to occur before
adolescence (e.g., before the age of 12),
with most diagnostic systems considering

[p. <i>257</i>]

Prior to the onset of schizophrenia,
some, but not all, people have impairments
in their premorbid social functioning
(Zigler &amp; Click, 1986). For example, some
people who later develop schizophrenia
were more socially isolated, passed fewer
social-sexual developmental milestones,
and had fewer friends in childhood and
adolescence. Aside from problems in social
functioning, prior to developing schizophrenia,
some individuals in childhood display
a maladaptive pattern of behaviors,
including disruptive behavior, problems in
school, and impulsivity (Baum &amp; Walker,
1995; Hans, Marcus, Henson, Auerbach, &amp;
Mirsky, 1992). Similarly, symptoms of
conduct disorder in childhood, such as
repeated fighting, truancy, and lying, have
been found to be predictive of the later
development of schizophrenia (Neumann,
Grimes, Walker, &amp; Baum, 1995; Robins,
1966). However, other clients display no
unusual characteristics in their premorbid
functioning.


A second mediating factor related to the
prognosis of schizophrenia is gender.
Women tend to have later age of onset of
the illness, spend less time in hospitals,
and demonstrate better social competence
and social functioning than do men
(Angermeyer, Kuhn, &amp; Goldstein, 1990;
Haas &amp; Garratt, 1998). The benefits experienced
by women do not appear to be
explained by societal differences in tolerance
for deviant behavior.


In general, onset of schizophrenia can
be described as either gradual or acute. The
gradual onset of schizophrenia can take
place over many months, and it may be difficult
for family members and others to
clearly distinguish onset of the illness. In
cases of acute onset, symptoms develop
rapidly over a period of a few weeks, with
dramatic and easily observed changes
occurring over this time. People with acute
onset of schizophrenia have a somewhat
better prognosis than do those with a more
insidious illness (Penton &amp; McGlashan,
1991; Kay &amp; Lindenmayer, 1987).


Although schizophrenia is a long-term
and severe psychiatric illness, there is considerable
interindividual variability in the
course of illness (Marango, 1994). Generally,
though, once schizophrenia has developed,
the illness usually continues to be present at
varying degrees of severity throughout most
of the person's life. Schizophrenia is usually
an episodic illness with periods of acute
symptom severity requiring more intensive,
often inpatient, treatment interspersed by
periods of higher functioning between
episodes. Despite the fact that most clients
with schizophrenia live in the community, it
is comparatively rare, at least in the shortterm,
for clients to return to their premorbid
levels of functioning between episodes.


Some general predictors of the course
and outcome of schizophrenia have been
identified, such as premorbid functioning,
but overall, the ability to predict outcome is
rather poor (Avison &amp; Speechley, 1987;
Tsuang, 1986). The primary reason for this is

[p. <i>258</i>]
<b>Recommended Data-Based Treatments</b>

<b><i>Brief Description</i></b>


Comprehensive treatment is needed for
most clients with schizophrenia to attend
to a wide range of their needs. The most
common elements of treatment include case
management, pharmacological treatment,
and psychosocial rehabilitation.


The role of case management is to identify
client needs, link clients to interventions,
monitor outcomes, and advocate for clients,
including obtaining entitlements (Mueser,
Bond, Drake, &amp; Resnick, 1998). Although
most clients with schizophrenia benefit from
case management, one model of more intensive
case management is appropriate for
clients with a recent history of multiple hospitalizations
and poor psychosocial functioning:
the Assertive Community Treatment
(ACT) model (Allness &amp; Knoedler, 1998;
Stein &amp; Santos, 1998). The ACT model is
distinguished from standard case management
by the lower clinician-to-case management
ratio (1:10 in ACT vs. 1:30 or more in
standard case management), shared caseloads
across clinicians (rather than individual
caseloads), services provided in the community
rather than the clinic, 24-hour coverage,
and services given directly by the team
(rather than brokered to other providers).
ACT has been found to reduce rehospitalizations
and symptom severity, and to improve
housing stability in multiple studies (Bond,
Drake, Mueser, &amp; Latimer, 2001).


Pharmacological treatment with antipsychotic
medications, especially the newer
atypical antipsychotics (Jibson &amp; Tandon,
1998), is the mainstay of treatment for
schizophrenia. Some clients also benefit
from adjunctive medications, such as antidepressants
or mood stabilizers (Rush et al.,
1999). The vast majority of clients with
schizophrenia experience at least some
benefit from medication.


With respect to psychosocial treatment,
several interventions have been shown to be
effective at improving outcomes in people
with schizophrenia. <i>Family psychoeducation</i>
is appropriate for clients in regular
contact with relatives and is aimed at developing
a collaborative relationship between
the treatment team and family, reducing
stress, improving communication and problem
solving, and helping members achieve
personal and shared goals (Mueser &amp;
Glynn, 1999). Extensive research shows
that family psychoeducation, when provided
over an extended period of time (usually
at least 9 months), is effective at
reducing relapses and rehospitalizations,
and at improving the family environment
(Pitschel-Walz, Leucht, Bäuml, Kissling, &amp;
Engel, 2001).


<i>Social skills training</i> involves reaching
new interpersonal skills, based on the principles
of social learning theory, for improving

[p. <i>259</i>]

<i>Integrated treatment of dual disorders</i>
(mental illness and substance use disorders)
involves the use of outreach to engage
clients in treatment; motivational strategies;
nonconfrontational approaches; and group,
individual, and family approaches to
treat both disorders (Mueser, Drake, &amp;
Noordsy, 1998). Integrated treatment of
both disorders is superior to separate treatment
because it ensures that each disorder is
addressed, and it minimizes possible inconsistencies
between different groups of treatment
providers. Research shows that
integrated dual disorder treatment is effective
at reducing substance abuse in clients
with schizophrenia (Drake et al., 2001).


<i>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</i> for psychosis
involves helping clients evaluate the
evidence supporting delusional beliefs, as
well as developing more realistic and more
adaptive ways of thinking (Fowler, Garety, &amp;
Kuipers, 1995). Cognitive-behavioral therapy
is most appropriate for clients with persistent
psychotic symptoms resulting in behavioral
disruption or significant subjective distress.
Research on cognitive therapy indicates that
it reduces the severity of psychosis, and, in
some studies, it lowers the risk of relapses
and rehospitalizations (Gould, Mueser,
Bolton, Mays, &amp; Goff, 2001).


Training in <i>illness management</i>
involves providing clients with basic information
about their psychiatric illness and
principles of treatment, developing strategies
for taking medication as prescribed, teaching
relapse prevention skills, and helping clients
develop more effective ways of coping with
persistent symptoms. Research on illness
management training supports each of these
core components of treatment (Mueser,
Corrigan, et al., in press).


<i>Supported employment</i> is a vocational
rehabilitation intervention used to assist
people with schizophrenia and other psychiatric
disorders to improve their work functioning
(Becker &amp; Drake, 1993; Bond,
Becker, et al., 2001). Employment specialists
work one-on-one with individuals who
desire assistance in obtaining employment
or, for those employed, in developing the
skills and strategies for maintaining employment.
Traditional vocational rehabilitation
interventions emphasized prevocational
assessment and training to prepare people
with severe mental illness for employment.
Supported employment, which helps people
find employment directly, has shown higher
rates of employment when compared to traditional
vocational approaches such as prevocational
work units and skills training,
transitional employment, and sheltered work
(Bond, Drake, Mueser, &amp; Becker, 1997;
Drake, Becker, Clark, &amp; Mueser, 1999).


In supported employment, employment
specialists assist people in identifying a
good Job match based on the person's preferences,
skills, strengths, and unique challenges.
The employment specialist may
advocate directly with potential employers
if the client is willing to disclose his or her
psychiatric status to employers. In some
cases, when the employment specialist
introduces him- or herself, just the name of
the specialist's employer reveals that the
client is receiving mental hcalth services.
When contacting employers, the employment
specialist is sometime better able to
advocate for a client because of the social

[p. <i>260</i>]

The most common barrier to employment
for people with schizophrenia is fear
of losing governmental benefits such as
Social Security income, Social Security
disability insurance, and Medicaid. The
employment specialist helps the client
obtain accurate information about how
his or her particular package of benefits will
be affected by working. Many people work
part-time so that they do not lose their
health insurance. The client and/or the
employment specialist negotiate the desired
number of hours with the employer.


Employment specialists work closely
with other treatment providers to ensure
that services are integrated at the level of
client delivery. The treatment providers
form a team, meeting at least weekly, to
share information, develop plans, and
increase collaboration to support clients in
different aspects of their lives, including
employment.


The client is provided individualized,
time-unlimited support to maintain employment.
The type of support varies according
to the needs of the individual. Most support
is provided away from the job site. People
with schizophrenia often feel stigmatized
when the employment specialist is present
at the job site. Furthermore, clients usually
have little difficulty performing job duties if
the job match is good. People with schizophrenia
want to be treated like others without
mental illness at the work site. In most
cases, the employment specialist meets regularly
with the client away from the job site
to review his or her work progress. If the
client permits the employment specialist to
speak with the employer, the employment
specialist makes contact periodically to find
out if the client is performing satisfactorily
at the job.


<b><i>Time Element</i></b>


Overall, treatment for schizophrenia,
including case management and pharmacological
treatment, needs to be long-term.
The provision of supported employment
services should also be long-term, although
the intensity of support may decrease over
time as clients become increasingly able to
handle the demands of work on their own.


Specific interventions often can be
delivered on a time-limited basis. Family
psychoeducational programs typically last
between 9 months and 2 years, although
families (including clients) may also benefit
from continued participation in support
groups. Social skills training is usually provided
in programs lasting between 3 or
4 months to more than a year. Cognitivebehavioral
treatment for psychotic symptoms
and illness management programs
generally last between 6 and 12 months,
although some programs last even longer.
Finally, integrated programs for dual
disorders are usually relatively long-term,
lasting several years, with the duration of
participation depending on when individual
clients achieve stable remission of their substance
use disorders.


<b><i>Side Effects of Treatment</i></b>


With the exception of pharmacological
treatments, other interventions for schizophrenia
do not have significant side effects.
As newer medications for schizophrenia
have been developed, severity of side effects
has decreased. Nevertheless, side effects do
occur, and recognition and management of
them can prevent them from interfering
with work functioning. The most common
side effects of newer generation antipsychotic

[p. <i>261</i>]

Other side effects of medications used to
treat schizophrenia can also be present.
Some of the more common ones include
increased weight gain, dizziness, dry mouth,
and tremor. These side effects may have
some minor effects on work performance,
depending on the nature of the task.
Accurate detection of medication side effects
can lead to effective management of them,
such as reducing dosage levels or trying
alternative medications.


<b><i>Workplace Accommodations</i></b>


Accommodations at the workplace are
identified to help a client manage consequences
of the illness and still work. The
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
requires employers with more than 15
employees to make reasonable accommodations
to employ people with disabilities
who would otherwise be qualified for the
job. The types of accommodations requested
by people with schizophrenia typically are
low cost to the employer. An example of an
accommodation is flexible work hours,
such as adjusting the work schedule for
appointments and medical leaves, providing
more frequent breaks, and arranging time
off without pay. Modification of the work
space and job tasks include minimizing
distractions and noise, providing space to
work alone, gradual introduction of tasks,
and modification of job tasks. Crisis intervention
includes procedures for emergency
situations, telephone calls to employment
specialists, and private space. The employment
specialist, the client, and the employer
meet to draw up an individualized plan for
the necessary workplace accommodations.

<b>Maintenance of Gains/Relapse Prevention</b>

Because schizophrenia is generally accepted
to be a disorder that persists throughout
much of the lifetime, gains made during
treatment and rehabilitation are most likely
to be maintained if adequate social supports
are available to the client, and if he or she
has ongoing contact with the treatment
team. For most clients, pharmacological
treatment, supported employment, and case
management are the core ingredients that
need to be in place in order to maintain
competitive employment. Other services
may be required on a time-limited basis,
such as social skills training, individual
counseling, and family psychoeducation.


Relapses in schizophrenia typically
involve increases in psychotic symptoms,
which are often accompanied by cognitive
disorganization and mood instability.
Whereas severe relapses may prevent the
client from fulfilling job responsibilities
altogether, and possibly require hospitalization,
minor relapses often can be treated
effectively, resulting in minimal disruption
to work performance and preventing major
relapses. The key to preventing major
relapses, and thereby maintaining steady
and good job performance, is good monitoring
of the client's psychiatric functioning,

[p. <i>262</i>]

Relapses tend to occur slowly over
time, with small changes in mood, cognitive
functioning, and energy preceding the emergence
or worsening of psychotic symptoms.
These changes, or early warning signs of
relapse, are unique to each client, but they
are often stable across episodes within a
given client. Identifying the early warning
signs of relapse, monitoring these signs, and
taking steps to address them when they
emerge (e.g., providing additional medication)
can be effective at preventing full-blown
episodes and maintaining functional
capacity (Herz, Glazer, Mirza, Mostert, &amp;
Hafez, 1989; Herz et al., 2000).

<b>Summary</b>

Schizophrenia is a complex mental illness
characterized by reduced functioning in the
areas of vocational adjustment, social relationships,
and self-care, and a wide range of
symptoms, including hallucinations and
delusions, reduced social drive, and
cognitive impairment. Effective pharmacological
and psychosocial treatments exist
for schizophrenia that can minimize symptoms
and impairments, and facilitate the
ability of clients to work. Of particular relevance
to successful vocational functioning
for clients with schizophrenia is the availability
of supported employment services.
Supported employment involves assistance
from an employment specialist in identify
ing and obtaining jobs in areas related to
clients' interests, providing ongoing supports
to successfully manage job demands
and the social environment of the workplace,
availability to employers to discuss
job-related issues concerning the client, and
negotiating reasonable accommodations
with employers. Of particular importance,
supported employment services are most
effective when they are integrated with
other aspects of treatment, and when
employment specialists function as members
of clients' treatment teams. Although
schizophrenia is a serious mental illness,
comprehensive treatment, access to supported
employment services, and a supportive
work environment make many
clients capable of being consistent and
valued employees.
