BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Is this picking this up?  Because I wrote some notes that I really didn't want to forget so that I could -
<b>DR:</b> Are you saying it's very active?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, they are.  There's some, well, there's an ongoing drama here I remember, that -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, there's, I don't know, it's just, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, all right.
<b>PT:</b> But it's okay.
<b>DR:</b> But before you tell me the story -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, let's go through -
<b>DR:</b> Let me -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Let me make sure that the other things surfaced.  Um, we last met on [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and that point you, you saw him in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Your mood was okay.  Your energy was low.  Your appetite was good.  You were sleeping well.  Your self esteem was fine.  You weren't suicidal or hopeless or helpless.  Uh, you were concentrating, you were getting pleasure normally.  And we spent most of the time talking about this, um, bit of a drama -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Over your husband -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Your ex-boyfriend -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, and all of that.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  How have, well, tell me, tell me the short version.  Because I, I want to know what happened with, what, what has happened in that drama?
<b>PT:</b> Just that drama?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just that drama.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Um, we, we spoke.  And then, um, I think it was, like, New Years Eve I got a, a very nice message from him wishing me a happy holidays, I miss you, very nice.  And then, uh, uh, I didn't hear from him for about a week, and then I got an e-mail saying that you know, that he was really down and out with the flu, and I didn't hear from him for about 2 weeks.  And, uh, and then, uh, and I e-mailed him saying, you know, "Are you in the hospital?"  "Do you have pneumonia?"  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then early this morning, and it was about 4:00, I don't know why, I just had, uh, another issue I couldn't sleep.  And I didn't know what to do, so I look in my e-mail, and it said, "Let's talk tomorrow, I feel a little better."  And I wrote him back, "Let's see how you feel tomorrow."  I'm looking for -
<b>DR:</b> So this was today?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  So we can -
<b>DR:</b> And you haven't talked today?
<b>PT:</b> No, I haven't talked to him.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> So that's where we stand.
<b>PT:</b> So you know what, okay, my, you know, my heart can overrule my head, and I, I think I, what, what, whatever the future holds it holds.  I'm not, [NAME OTHER] knows nothing.  I don't know where I am.  It's sort, it's sort of you know what -
<b>DR:</b> Well, but the fact that [NAME OTHER] knows nothing, and that it's at least still engaged, is, is reasonable success.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That things didn't blow up, you didn't do anything rash or -
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> You know, that you'll regret, or manic, or anything like that.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You just kind of maintained this at a low simmer, and it's stupid -
<b>PT:</b> I mean it hurt that I didn't hear from him.  He's not a responsive man.  He's a very private kind of guy, one word, bah, bah, bah, you know.  But, um, I don't play games.  I don't ever want to play games with somebody, uh, I'm too old for that.  So the last e-mail I wrote was, "You know how I feel.  I'm very caring that you don't feel well.  Uh, it would be nice to have a very quick response, just a few words, so that I know where you're coming from."  That's, that's it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I am, you can't change my DNA.
<b>DR:</b> And if he responded to that?
<b>PT:</b> No, I didn't hear from him today yet.  After that, which I just wrote like an hour ago, and I haven't responded.  But I, I don't think he -
<b>DR:</b> No, no, but then 4:00 AM -
<b>PT:</b> I just said, "Let's see how you feel.  And I will try to e-mail you between 8:00 and 8:30."  And then I e-mailed him, and I said, "I'm available to speak this morning."  I didn't hear back from him.  And then that's when that other e-mail went out.  But, you know, he could be sleeping, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  How has your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Bad, uh, no, wait, hold on.  No, no, if it's, I don't know if it's been, there's so much that, that took place that I don't know what it is.  I, I, I just, I'm so, I could, I don't know.  It's bad -
<b>DR:</b> You don't know if you're happy, sad or mutual?  Usually?  I mean, you're allowed to be any mood.  But is it, what's the mood state underneath that is kind of the set one?  [PATIENT NAME], if something -
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Something sad happens you feel sad.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, look, a lot of sad things happened over the holidays.  Of course you're going to feel sad; a lot of things that would make anyone angry.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And then you re-established a set point?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I -
<b>DR:</b> When you stayed those ways?
<b>PT:</b> I've tried over the last 2 days to bring myself back, to try to bring myself back to a condition of normalcy because I saw it affecting my health.
<b>DR:</b> So your, your mood is let's say reactive at least, right?
<b>PT:</b> My mood is reactive, but I shut my mouth.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> How's that?
<b>DR:</b> Um, are you sad a lot of the time?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Are you anxious a lot of the time?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Are you irritable a lot of the time?  Is your fuse short?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I, I should retract that.  No, no, no.  And what did you say, am I anxious?
<b>DR:</b> Irritable.
<b>PT:</b> Is that what you said before that?
<b>DR:</b> Anxious, anxious.
<b>PT:</b> Referring to I'm anxious, yes.  He makes me very anxious, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Why does he make you anxious?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Are you nervous about something specifically?  About getting caught, or -
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no, not that.  Uh, look, and I can make this in 2 seconds because I can just read it off.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so let's go through your plan.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and I had a New Year's Eve party.  She had 25 kids sleeping over.  There was a snow storm that day, and did not want to get in the car with [NAME OTHER] because I just, I felt his mood.
<b>DR:</b> New Years Eve party in the city?
<b>PT:</b> In the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> In the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> It took me 5 1/2 hours with the dogs to get there.  I, did you know that I didn't even put on my headlights, that's how -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  But where are all of her friends?
<b>PT:</b> They all came to the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> City friends?
<b>PT:</b> City, everybody, and they stayed overnight.
<b>DR:</b> Everyone came out to the [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, and they stayed overnight.  Okay.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Wow, you're a nice mom.
<b>PT:</b> It's the last time.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I don't suggest it, by the way.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my gosh.
<b>PT:</b> So there are, uh 25, 30 kids, and I -
<b>DR:</b> And you had to find a place for everyone to sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Our house is big so they were, you know, it was, they were on the floor.  They, they stay up until all hours of the morning, they eat breakfast, they're not, you know, they have no hangovers after all the booze they drank.  But no one was allowed home that night, et cetera, until they were -
<b>DR:</b> Where did they get all the booze?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, [NAME OTHER] bought it all.  We took care of everything.
<b>DR:</b> You did?
<b>PT:</b> By, by the time it was done, it was thousands of dollars.  And, you know, you pay for a New Years Eve party and that's that.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Was this a gift to [NAME OTHER] or this was -
<b>PT:</b> You know, she's bugged us for I don't know how many years, that all of her friends have had one, and she never -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b> Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  So she has one.  Fine.  They were all pretty well-behaved and it was fine.  Okay.  Nevertheless, you know -
<b>DR:</b> And she, she had been staying in the city for the break?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> With you guys?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay.  So everybody gets -
<b>DR:</b> Was she happy, was she happy with the party?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But, you know, [NAME OTHER] is the kind that forgets that she's, you know, she could be an actress, and have the CAA workers there, because she would say, "What did you do for me?  What'd you do next?"
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, or -
<b>PT:</b> That's, uh -
<b>DR:</b> What did you do for me lately?
<b>PT:</b> Right, exactly.  So, um -
<b>DR:</b> Well, I'm impressed.  And kudos to you for doing that.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't know.  So the next night, [NAME OTHER] has been, uh, bugging [NAME OTHER] as to whether or not she's going to stay in this med, is, is, is she going to go to medical school.  And, uh, it, it's a constant thing.  And I understand where he's coming from.  So I said to him -
<b>DR:</b> She's a junior?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So I said, "[NAME OTHER], look," I, my approach is just different, "She's going to come to us and she's going to say, yes or no."  And he says, "Well, I want an, you know, I want an answer now."  And I guess he's really gave it to her.  And then, uh, she came in, and, and she said, you know, "You don't care, mom, about my education, it's dad," and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I said, "Hold on a minute here."  I said, "Hold on."
<b>DR:</b> She likes that dad cares, is on her case?  Or she's got to, because is this good or bad that you're not pressuring her?
<b>PT:</b> So I said, "[NAME OTHER], I deal with things differently.  Eventually, you will come and you will tell me what you're going to do with your life.  You'll either want to do something else.  I want you to be happy.  I want you to be healthy and I want someone to -"
<b>DR:</b> Is it pressure he's giving her?
<b>PT:</b> He gives, he gives pressure, yes, in a very -
<b>DR:</b> He wants her to go to medical school or he doesn't?
<b>PT:</b> I think he, I think he did want her to.  Because that's, in my own feeling, I don't know, it's status for him.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I think.
<b>DR:</b> Which is not the best reason.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But, you know.
<b>PT:</b> But you know what?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, but it, but it's also a recognized professionally.
<b>PT:</b> It is a nice profession.
<b>DR:</b> And she's, and she's -
<b>PT:</b> But she is not doing well in her science -
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> And this and that, you know, and, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Does it fit her style?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Bergdorf Goodman fits her style.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I mean, what can I tell you?  She, she, I can't put it, she's a great kid.  She's incredible in journalism and communications.  She'll find her way.  I mean, I, I what am I supposed to say?  You know, "Go to medical school.  Go to medical school and be an," I can't do that to my children.  So he had written her a note.  And the note said, "I'm sorry that," he wrote her an e-mail.  Now, I wasn't involved in the conversation, but he read it to me.  And it said, "I'm sorry that I was very hard on you about medical school, but I really think that you can do it.  But, if you choose not to, I love you," blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's all it said.  He was repeating it to everybody who called the house, everybody.  He's calling people.  And I turned it around at about 11:30 at night when I heard him reading it to my other daughter.  I said, "[NAME OTHER], you don't need confirmation on this, stop.  Stop it."  He turned around; he went out of his mind.  He said to me, "You F-ing C.  You son of a bitch, you F-ing C.  I don't want to look at you, you F-ing C."  And then, and that's a word I can't stand.  I, I, it, it was like a, a, a, tirade that I, I, I, I was shaking, okay.  Now, I've had these tirades before he decides to air his story.  But I'm just telling because of what happened.  Maybe I shouldn't have irritated him by saying, "Don't repeat it to everyone."  Fast forward -
<b>DR:</b> Well, well you hit, hit the third rail with something.  You, you hit a very sensitive spot.
<b>PT:</b> I, I -
<b>DR:</b> Maybe you didn't realize you were, but it sounds like you were.
<b>PT:</b> But the punishment didn't fit the crime.  So what I'm saying is, I got -
<b>DR:</b> Well, and you didn't even know what, you know, uh -
<b>PT:</b> So I got up the next, um, I, I just put myself to sleep, I just let sleep do it.  The  next morning he woke up, now this is really sick, the next morning he woke up and he wanted sex.  So I said to myself, there's a part of my brain, that said maybe I should just have sex with him so he gets off my back.  And then the other part said that's stupid.  But I said, "No.  I can't take anymore, or, um, I, I just can't."  So I did.  And then afterwards I said "You know what, [NAME OTHER], I got to get out of here.  I made such a terrible mistake.  I did it because I was frightened of you.  I will never allow you to call me that word again, and I want to go back to New York."  And he was silent.  And he said, "Well I apologize for that word."  I said, "It's much more than that, [NAME OTHER].  And you really, really dug into me for no reason at all."  So as I'm getting ready to leave for New York, he said, "I don't feel good, I'm dizzy.  And you're going to leave a husband that's dizzy alone?"  So I said, "Well, how dizzy are you?"  He starts the whole thing.  I said, "Okay, as, as, as a wife, I don't want to leave you in the [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'll stay, but don't expect and any conversations with me today.  I can't do it.  I, I can't do it."  Okay -
<b>DR:</b> So this was your retaliation?
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't, I couldn't look at him.  Okay, here we go.  So we go back from the [DEIDENTIFIED] to New York, and my housekeeper, [NAME OTHER], who's been with us forever, had elbow surgery, and she can't work so she left.  Okay, we have 3 dogs, you know, the whole thing.  Your life is a little screwed up.  High class problem, okay, no problem.  Him wanting to go away, pushing me, pushing me, "We got to get away, got to get away, got to get a way.  You got to get away.  You got to get away.  I don't like the cold weather.  I don't like cold weather."  I said, "I'm doing my best to find someone to stay with the dogs.  What, what do you want from me?"  Okay.  Then, um, uh, I was woken up in the middle -
<b>DR:</b> Wait, wait, got to get away?  But you're, away were, like to -
<b>PT:</b> To the warm weather.  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Florida or something.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So then I'm wo, woken up one night because [NAME OTHER], at about 3:30 in the morning, I'm smelling like a [DEIDENTIFIED] bar.  I woke up, and I'm smelling this.  [NAME OTHER] hanging over me, and she says, "Mom, listen, I know I put a Tampax in but I can't find it."  She said, "I could have toxic shock syndrome."  I said, "Yeah, you could."  So she said, "Look, I don't know what to do."  I said, "Okay, you're going to the emergency room."  What am I going to say, you got to go.  So she, then she woke up [NAME OTHER].  I said, "Just do me a favor," it was like 4:00 in the morning.  I said, "Just get dressed, we'll go."  I'm waiting there, waiting there, there was a drug addict, and this, and that, and the other, "Mommy, you have to get out of the room," da, da, da, the people are saying.  And I'm thinking to myself -
<b>DR:</b> How could she not find, get the Tampax?
<b>PT:</b> She was so bombed, okay?  So I didn't, I, I sort of didn't get a good, it doesn't matter, I didn't get a good sleep.  Uh, that's, that's okay.  At least she told me.  She knew enough about toxic shock syndrome, the whole thing.  There was no Tampax.  Fine.  Let's go home.  Then -
<b>DR:</b> So nothing, it wasn't even in there.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> I'm telling you, I, I was -
<b>DR:</b> That's a great one.  That's funny.
<b>PT:</b> That is a funny story.  I mean, you have to admit, you have to understand it's here I am -
<b>DR:</b> I, you know, how, how can you not find it there, though, you know?  It's not, I mean -
<b>PT:</b> Believe me, I, I just said it, I, I said, "[NAME OTHER], leave it to the doctor."  And I heard the doctor as he was walking towards the room, where I had to leave eventually, "Just what I want to do at 4:30 in the morning."  I heard him say that.  So, uh, we were fine.  Then she said to me, "I'm very mad at you."  I said, "Okay, why is that?"  She said, "Because I, uh, picked up your phone and I saw an e-mail that you wrote.  And [NAME OTHER], to [NAME OTHER] saying that you were very mad at dad, and that if you could have had, if you, if you could you'd leave him.  I, and, and I should never have read the e-mail."  I said, "No, you shouldn't have read the e-mail."  I said, "Uh, what do you want to know?"  She said, "Well, I was just, uh, scared."  I said, "Well, first of all, don't read e-mails because you're reading have the truth."  I said, "And the second thing is, I'll be honest with you, your father called me a bad word.  I didn't like it, and at that particular point I did want to walk out."  I said, "So if you have any further questions, ask for the truth."  She felt terrible.  She said, "I'll never do that again."  Okay, on and, all right, then, then, wait a minute, hold on, now the biggie comes -
<b>DR:</b> Did you -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> I, I can't, I can't, I'm telling you.  Uh, so then -
<b>DR:</b> The level of drama is, uh -
<b>PT:</b> I, I can't take it, but I'm telling you.  I, I'm really, I'm, I'm, I'm, now I'm, it's, okay.  Then I find out that a guy that I grew up with, uh, maybe I've known him since I as [AGE], awfully nice man, had his son over for New Years Eve, uh, Day, uh, Eve, and, um, it's my cousin's, uh, closest friend, my cousin's mother, who's father [INAUDIBLE], okay.  And, uh, he, the kid didn't show up for New Years Day, and the father was concerned.  He's gone through a rough divorce.  And, uh, he's got a lovely girlfriend at, uh, a very close friend of mine, uh, this lady, really.  And he now had to break down the door, and his son was hanging in front of him and with a note.  Okay.  So this upset me like I can't tell you.  It was too close to home.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He's a good guy, a real good guy.  Uh -
<b>DR:</b> You didn't know the kid, you knew the father?
<b>PT:</b> I knew -
<b>DR:</b> And he was depressed?
<b>PT:</b> Apparently, from what my cousin said, who's his godfather, he never showed one outward sign of depression.  And he left this note that said he felt like a loser and, you know, and whatever, okay.  That upset me greatly, along with, you know, friends that I grew up with.  Okay.  It, it really, really upset me.  Then my father, who grew up in the depression, understood, believe me, believed and understood, life is, is, "We're going to be in bread lines.  We are going to be in bread lines.  This is the worst thing.  You don't know," on and on.  "Tenants can't pay their rent.  We're having this problem," that problem this problem.
<b>DR:</b> Did he get hurt by the Madoff fraud?
<b>PT:</b> No, thank God.  I'm telling you thank God.
<b>DR:</b> Because he probably runs in those circles.
<b>PT:</b> Thank God.  Okay.  So he was under such stress.  He comes home from Florida to try to get these tenants, or get new tenants, and, you know.
<b>DR:</b> He does a lot of commercial real estate?
<b>PT:</b> He owns shopping centers -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Throughout wherever.  And he does own the -
<b>DR:</b> And does, does he own [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Some of them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  And he -
<b>DR:</b> So he's renegotiating leases, and -
<b>PT:</b> It's horrible.
<b>DR:</b> It is.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  So, and I understood that.  And I understand that the stress level on that -
<b>DR:</b> He's involved in the day to day running of these things?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  He, let me tell you something.  He is, he won't forget a number.  He, oh, yeah, he's, he is as sharp as a tack when it comes to his, you know.
<b>DR:</b> How old is he?
<b>PT:</b> He's going to be [AGE].  Yeah, so, uh, it's, you know, it, it's, look, it is what it is.  Everyone is going through it, you know, what are you going to do?  So -
<b>DR:</b> Man, everyone has lost 40 to 60% in the last year with, so I guess he's, if he takes a hit at 40% or so, he's just even with everyone else, who had it in mutual fund.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And he, uh -
<b>DR:</b> But it's going to take a hit.  Everyone's is going to take a hit.
<b>PT:</b> Everyone is going to take a hit.  And he does not see it changing for 3 years, and all this stuff.  And I understand it, but, you know, living it day and night, and he doesn't take a break from, from this whatsoever, uh, it not only stirs me up, but, you know, my brother's trying to handling things.  They're trying this, uh, and so it was, uh, it's not been easy.  Okay.  Then my mother had a very bad bout and this is due to polymyalgia, okay, and it hurts, then she was having trouble walking.  Then 2, about 2 weeks ago my legs really hurt.  I didn't say anything, because when you -
<b>DR:</b> Was it joints?
<b>PT:</b> Every, yeah, they ached and my joints.  I said, oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> The muscles or the joints?
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't tell.  I really, they, they were just aching.
<b>DR:</b> Well, was it knees and ankles and hip?
<b>PT:</b> My kneecaps, my, uh, thighs, my, I just, they were aching.  Okay.  So, um, I've had it.  So, um, I had to go for the annual neurological testing to approve gamma globulin for a patient.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Only certain patients get approved.  I was there yesterday.  It was a frickin 2 1/2 hour test.  Everything comes out -
<b>DR:</b> But did they -
<b>PT:</b> But it's a, abnormal.
<b>DR:</b> Did they, did they do the full neurologic evaluation?
<b>PT:</b> No.  They do the needle studies.  They do this study.  They do that study.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  All right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, fine.  So the doctor just said to me, "Your motor," which I don't know what the hell he said, I wasn't listening.  All I heard was the motor nerve does not show any response.  The sensory nerve does, the motor nerves throughout your body didn't respond.  I said, "Okay, fine."
<b>DR:</b> Wh, why, why?  What's the reason for that?
<b>PT:</b> They think it's auto, autoimmune.
<b>DR:</b> That you, all right.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, fine.  Last night I came home, and it was, because it was a long test, I must have walked in at 6:30.  I put my hand down, and I said, "[NAME OTHER], don't even talk to me."  I said, "I'm in a little bit of a funk."  And I don't cry, but last night I did, like, I was tearing.  It lasted for about 3 minutes, and then I pulled myself together, and then I said, "Okay, enough.  Enough.  It's over.  All this shit is now over.  Get yourself together.  Get on with your life."  And I became normal again.
<b>DR:</b> You -
<b>PT:</b> And I told him not to speak to me last night.  I said, "Don't," I -
<b>DR:</b> Your boot straps you wa, you -
<b>PT:</b> And I said, "Don't call me a victim."
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> "Don't use your meanness on me."  I said, "Because it's not going to work."  I said, "I never complain about things, really very rarely about anything to do with lupus."  I said, "But when lupus hits it's not easy," I said, "If there's a flare up."  I said, "So I don't complain."  He says, "I never says you complain."  I mean, please.  And I said, "I want space, and I want you to leave me alone, and nothing you say is going to help me.  Shut up."  I said, "The other thing is, I can't have interrupted sleep; the TV on, the this on, the that on until 2:00 in the morning," I said, "I can't do it.  I don't want to do it anymore."  He just listened.  He said, "Well, should I shut off the lights?"  I said, "That would be very nice."  Last night I did get a good night sleep so I felt better.  But I noticed that last night, after I had cried, I didn't cry from sadness, I didn't cry from anger, it was exhaustion.
<b>DR:</b> Just -
<b>PT:</b> Exhaustion.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then I just, I said to myself, I pulled myself up, and I said, "That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  These things happened.  They happened.  Now you go forward."
<b>DR:</b> Good.  That's great.  That's, you know, people who get cognitive behavioral therapy, that's what they seek to achieve, what, what you just described.  I mean, it's nice that you're doing it kind of on your own without the therapy.  Therapy would help you with exactly that, with kind of reframing things cognitively, putting them where they belong, and -
<b>PT:</b> Well, you've just done that for me.
<b>DR:</b> Where there's hope.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't need to see a therapist, you just did it for me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I, I just listened to you.
<b>PT:</b> You just, well, no, you said, okay, but that's the correct thing to do.  So -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Well, that, right.  Okay.  I mean, that's, that's the healthy thing -
<b>PT:</b> It's a -
<b>DR:</b> Psychologically.
<b>PT:</b> Healthy thing psychologically -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That one must do to, to live.
<b>DR:</b> Yep.  Especially someone with a mood disorder.
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> Because if you stew in, in the juices too much, your mood disorder will kick in.
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> And that, it'll, it'll hold you there.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, very nice.  Um, and your appetite's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Your sleep, now, how much, uh, steroid you taking, how much prednisone?
<b>PT:</b> I got dow, myself down to 5, but, and I was great on that for about 2 months, but then I had took 7.5 yesterday, because it, it -
<b>DR:</b> When -
<b>PT:</b> Because it bothered me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And did it help?  Can you tell the difference?  I mean 7.5 is not that much, but it's a 50% -
<b>PT:</b> It kicked in enough.
<b>DR:</b> It's 50% more, but it takes 24 hours for any change in steroids to do anything.
<b>PT:</b> It kicked in enough, so that I felt comfortable with walking.  Okay?  That's great.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  So you're not taking, are you exercising at all?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And what's your energy like in general?
<b>PT:</b> The last couple of weeks it's been low, but that's, I think that has, had to do with just maybe, uh, feeling like there was some bricks on me.
<b>DR:</b> Um, did you use any Provigil?
<b>PT:</b> Nope, I haven't used any Provigil.
<b>DR:</b> So I guess you felt like you didn't need it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> And you're using the thyroid then, right?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yes.
<b>DR:</b> You take the thyroid every day?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Um, any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> Mm, um, mm, no.
<b>DR:</b> And how, how did things settle out with your husband?
<b>PT:</b> Well, last night he shut his mouth.
<b>DR:</b> He did.  So -
<b>PT:</b> He shut his mouth.  First of all, I came in, got undressed.  He said, "Oh, how do you feel?"  I said, "Well, I'm fine."  I got in bed.  He said, "Oh, God, what are all those marks on you?"  I said, "It's just test stuff."  "What did they say?"  I said, "I can't explain it, you know, the doctor will explain it to me."  Although, the doctor had explained a little bit to me.  And, um, oh, then the doctor said -
<b>DR:</b> And you don't want to, you don't want to talk to him much it sounds like.
<b>PT:</b> No.  You know what, I don't want to be called by him a victim.  And I don't act like one.  I can sit here, and I know as, as we have said, 14 sides to every story, but I get when he's mad that, and I will never tolerate it again, so, therefore, I want him out of my health life.
<b>DR:</b> That's, but that's a sensitive topic for you, for some reason.
<b>PT:</b> I don't, you know why?  If I focus on it, it's not healthy.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Whatever the doctor says, okay, your motor ner, your motor nerves do not function.  Okay.  Well, doctor, what do you do?
<b>DR:</b> Well, they're probably sluggish.  Because you can walk.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he said, "You need more IVIG," his answer, okay.  Huh.  I don't, what am I supposed to do?  I don't like, I don't produce on this stuff.  I would rather say I'm a healthy person, let's go.  And I don't want to hear it from him.  I don't want to hear it from him.  I don't discuss it with anybody, except for maybe you and my closest friend.  What am I, you know, and you know what, if it's denial, good for me.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.  It's, it, denial is actually one of the healthiest defense mechanisms.
<b>PT:</b> It sure is.
<b>DR:</b> It's, it's not that unhealthy.
<b>PT:</b> You know, what am I supposed to do, be like the little sad, what do I do, I do?  I can't stand that in people.
<b>DR:</b> But physiologically, it's a little interesting why this is such a sensitive spot for you.  Almost like whatever you said to him that night that he, he blew up, is the stuff he gets you, not, this is how he unravels you.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Is by saying that you've embraced the victim's role.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  Well -
<b>DR:</b> And so that makes you nuts.
<b>PT:</b> I got to tell you why.  Maybe you should, I should just say this, and I know you have to go.  When I had ITP -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I was really, really sick with my platelets being about, I think they were down to 8000.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> And [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was my hematologist.  And that was -
<b>DR:</b> You got transfused?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no.  I, they used, I had a bone marrow thing, and a, a test, and then they used heavy amounts of steroids, I don't know, it was 80 mg, and then they used IV, uh, the gamma globulin.  And I was just about to have my spleen out.  Uh, but all of a sudden, 2 days before, they started to rise a little.  So I was very lucky.  But I, I was sick with that for many years.  Fast forward, uh, one day [NAME OTHER] was on, was doing okay, and then he, and I was, um, brushing my teeth, and irritated, everything was [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I said, "Oh, God,"  like that.  "Oh, please," like that.  He came over to me, and he pushed me, and he said, "You're the poster child for ITP."  And he pushed me so hard that I'll never forget it.  I was in tears, and I went, whoop, right down on the floor.  I said, "What did you just do?"  He said, "You're the poster child for ITP, get over it."  And I, I, that, from this, from that moment on, I know he was on drugs, and I understand it wasn't the real him, and I can forgive that, I swear to you I can forgive that, but I can't ever hear again that  I'm a victim of anything.  That, I'm looking in your eyes, when [NAME OTHER] was on cocaine, it was that abusive.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And my daughter, who works for [NAME OTHER] now, said to [NAME OTHER], and to me, that the employees that went back with [NAME OTHER], now, it's very small, have said that he's started to change.  But they used to run in fear when he would come into the office, that he was so cold.  Okay.  So there, some things you want to forget, and I do.  This one was a little bit harder.  That's part of the reason, I suppose.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe.  I think it's your earlier, I, I think it's your early life father issues.
<b>PT:</b> It could be, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Because your father's kind of a stiff-upper-lip, lip kind of guy and, and being too much woe is me victim, um, doesn't please him.  I think that's, uh, you know, there, there are many layers to things.  I think that, uh, that, that's to me a more obvious deeper layer than that one.  That, that's on there.  And, you know, and there are probably even deeper ones than that.
<b>PT:</b> Probably.  I don't even remember.
<b>DR:</b> But, uh, but your dad is that kind of person, right?  He doesn't, uh -
<b>PT:</b> He, he doesn't tolerate, you know, bullshit, and he doesn't tolerate, you know, and he doesn't tolerate.
<b>DR:</b> And he doesn't gratify victims.
<b>PT:</b> Well, no.
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't like people assuming the victim role, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I think that's a stronger, that makes it more sensitive for you -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Than, than, I, I think you are more affected by your father than by your husband.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it very well, you know if very well could be.  But the fact that you taught me to, last night I was able to pull myself together, and say, okay, forward girlfriend, go, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And stop.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I did.
<b>DR:</b> So anyway, it sounds like you have a charged phone conversation coming today?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if it's today, or if it'll be tomorrow, or when he feels better.
<b>DR:</b> What do you think he wants to say?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's just probably catching up on things.  And, you know, what, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I can't predict the future.  No one predicts the future.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, right now I'm with my husband and my children.  Of course I have feelings for this man, and I think he has feelings for me.  We may be great friends for the rest of our lives, or we may never speak again.
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad your daughter didn't see that e-mail.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> Although, I, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Be more care, be careful.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no, but I, yeah, I permanently, you know, that I'm careful about, that's deleted.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But, um, you know, um, what do I think will happen?  You know, I don't, I don't know.  What do you think is going to happen?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know.  I'm waiting.  I, I don't want to predict anything.  Uh, let's just, you know, come -
<b>PT:</b> Well, you predicted that, uh, we would talk, I think you predicted that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, I don't want to keep you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  All right.  Take care of yourself.
<b>PT:</b> All right.  I'll think on that one.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> And I'll, I'll see you in a month, I'll see 1 or 2 months, whenever.
<b>PT:</b> I may be [INAUDIBLE], yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sorry that I took so much time.
<b>DR:</b> That's all right.  Take care.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> See you.
<b>PT:</b> Best to your family.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you.
<b>PT:</b> And a good healthy New Year.
<b>DR:</b> You too.  Give my best.  I know everyone.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, sure.  I will give my best to everyone.  Thanks you, very much.
