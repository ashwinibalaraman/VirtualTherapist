<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DISORDER</b>


One out of every two Americans will be
exposed, sometime during his or her lifetime,
to a kind of traumatic event known
to produce stress reactions. Between 7%
and 9%, or perhaps 25,300,000 people, will
persist in their reactions to trauma to the
extent that they could be classified as meeting
diagnostic criteria for post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (Kessler, Sonnega,
Bromet, Hughes, &amp; Nelson, 1995). What
we do not know is what proportion of the
American workforce is symptomatic for
PTSD. Because work tends to be more
stressful than other domains of living, we
can only conclude that more than 9% of the
American workforce is, at any one time,
symptomatic for PTSD. We can infer that
unacknowledged and untreated PTSD is a
hidden disorder in the American workforce
that affects productivity negatively.
Unfortunately, many questions about PTSD
in the workplace, with exceptions as noted
in this chapter, have not been addressed in
any rigorous and scientific way. However,
acknowledging that we know little, we must
now be about our business of creating work
environments that improve not just the
physical safety, but also the psychological
safety, of workers, both employees and
employers. The possibility of terrorist attacks
and anthrax scares underscore the need for
clinicians to do more in the workplace. This
chapter specifies how PTSD can be confronted
and resolved in the workplace.


PTSD is classified as a form of Anxiety
Disorder that results from exposure to lifethreatening
events. It is diagnosed when six
criteria are met (See Box 11.1, from <i>DSM-IV</i>,
American Psychiatric Association
[APA], 1994):
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2039');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2039" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Detailed descriptions of the diagnostic features of PTSD are given in the
<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i> (APA, 1994,
Code 309.81, pp. 424-429).</div>

[p. <i>216</i>]

<b>Box 11.1 <i>DSM-IV</i> Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Criteria</b>


Criterion A. Exposure to a life-threatening event. The stress posed by this event
must be extreme and personal. It must involve actual or threatened death or serious
injury, or the threat to the physical integrity of self or other person, or learning about
unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury, experienced by
a family member or other close associate.


Criterion B. Traumatic event is re-experienced in at least one of the following ways:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Recurrent distressing dreams of the event;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Reliving the event;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Intense distress experienced during exposure to internal or external cues associated
with the traumatic event;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Physiological reactivity to these cues.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


1. Recurrent distressing dreams of the event;


2. Reliving the event;


3. Intense distress experienced during exposure to internal or external cues associated
with the traumatic event;


4. Physiological reactivity to these cues.


Criterion C. A persistent pattern of trying to avoid stimuli associated with the
trauma, and/or numbing of responsiveness, including:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Efforts to avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>
3. Inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. Emotional detachment or estrangement from others
</p>

Criterion D. A pattern of persistent symptoms of increased arousal which began
after the trauma, including:

<tr><td>
<p>
1. Sleep disturbance
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Irritability, angry outbursts

1. Sleep disturbance


2. Irritability, angry outbursts


3. Difficulty concentrating


4. Hypervigilance


5. Exaggerated startle response.


Criterion E. Criteria B, C, and D last more than one month. The onset of symptoms
under criteria B, C, and D are acute if they persist for less than three months; are
chronic, if they last more than three months; and onset is called delayed if symptoms
appear more than six months after original trauma.


Criterion F. Criteria B, C, and D impair functioning.


PTSD in the <i>DSM-IV</i> (APA, 1994) differs
significantly from the classification of
PTSD in the <i>DSM-III</i> (APA, 1980) in that a
new criterion, F, is added: "The disturbance
causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning" (APA,
1994, p. 429).


The addition of this new criterion for
classifying PTSD, highlighting the functional
impact of PTSD in the workplace, emphasizes
that PTSD is associated not merely

[p. <i>217</i>]

<i><b>Need for a Psychology of PTSD
in the Workplace</b></i>


Although PTSD appears much later
in the <i>DSM</i>s than, for example, Major
Depressive Disorder or Schizophrenia--
both of which present in <i>DSM-I</i> and <i>DSM-II</i>
of the 1950s and 1960s--nevertheless,
rapid strides have been made in understanding
PTSD since the formulation of its diagnostic
criteria in 1980. Psychometrically
sound measures of PTSD have been written
and tested for clinical utility (see
Assessment section below) (Wilson &amp;
Keane, 1997). Some randomized clinical
trials of treatments are reported, and many
treatment effectiveness studies are under
way, providing an empirically validated
body of best practices (Foa, Keane, &amp;
Friedman, 2000).


Despite this progress, many questions
remain unanswered about this relatively
new disorder in the <i>DSM</i>. Most research
on PTSD assessment and treatment has
centered on PTSD as residuals of lifethreatening
experiences in combat, crimes,
accidents, domestic abuse, and natural
disasters, without attention to causes and
effects in the workplace. However, with
inclusion of occupational dysfunction in
the latest <i>DSM-IV</i> formulation of PTSD, the
workplace is identified as a setting where
symptoms of PTSD may be manifested,
exacerbated, or even caused. Moreover, as
explained later in more detail, work may
also be among the cures for PTSD. What is
needed now is a psychology of PTSD in the
workplace, one that orients clinicians and
managers to workplace and worker interactions,
and that highlights ways in which
work and workers interact to cause, exacerbate,
or resolve PTSD.


<i><b>Need to Develop Mental
Health Services for Work
and Workers</b></i>


Work environments are important
places where mental health workers can
deliver needed services. There is a need for
practices that identify employees who
require treatment for nonwork traumas
that workers bring from home to the workplace,
such as domestic violence or childhood
physical or sexual abuse. Also needed
are practices that respond to the residuals
of trauma that occur at work, such as violence
between employees, terrorist attacks,
or exposure to biological toxins. Mental
health services must address the unique
problems of employees when the work they
are doing increases the risk of stress and
trauma, such as through exposure to toxins
and industrial accidents, or when dangers
are experienced in the line of duty (e.g.,
police, firefighters, mental health workers).
And finally, workplaces need to be prepared
for those unfortunate times when
natural and human disasters strike the
workplace and the workforce. One of the
many unanticipated consequences resulting
from the terrorist attacks on New York
City and the Pentagon on September 11,
2001, as well as the subsequent anthrax
scare and deaths, is the necessity for clinicians
to rethink their approaches in the
workplace for coping with trauma. So, the
workplace is becoming an important
environment in which residuals of traumatic
events, however experienced, can be
addressed and assuaged.


<i><b>It Is Good Business to Prepare
for and Cope With Trauma</b></i>


Why should employers be concerned
about untreated trauma and possibilities or
exposure to trauma in the workplace? The
basic answer is that "caring" work environments,
those that invest in human capital,

[p. <i>218</i>]

There is also a darker side to PTSD,
notably, an undetermined incidence of
"false memories" about traumatic events,
even faking PTSD, in hopes of obtaining
benefits and pensions due to alleged workrelated
injuries and/or claimed exposure to
work-related threats to life (e.g., Flannery,
1995). Erroneous cases of worker compensation
settled on behalf of clients should be
warning enough to employers that it is
essential to assess employees accurately
about alleged, current work-related injuries
or stresses. Work environments that fail to
undertake routine psychological assessment
of employees, particularly in those corporations
and businesses in high-risk industries,
run the risk of worker compensation cases
occurring well above industry averages
(e.g., Burgess, Hibler, Keegan, &amp; Everly,
1996). Potential for worker compensation
litigation requires that managers plan to
address trauma in the workplace by creating
a caring organization that copes with
life-threatening events that affect workers.

<b>Epidemiology</b>

Prevalence of PTSD, considered across the
workplace in general, is unknown.
However, one may infer workplace rates
from prevalence of PTSD in the general
population. Studies show that PTSD in
the general population ranges from 1% to
14% (APA, 1994; Breslau &amp; Davis, 1992;
Breslau, Davis, &amp; Andreski, 1995;
Davidson &amp; Fairbank, 1993; Davidson,
Hughes, Blazer, &amp; George, 1991; Fairbank,
Jordan, &amp; Schlenger, 1996; Fairbank,
Schlenger, Saigh, &amp; Davidson, 1995;
Kulka &amp; Schlenger, 1993). The best estimates
of lifetime rates of PTSD in the general
population are 10% to 12% for
women, 6% to 8% for men, and 7% to 9%
for the general population (Kessler et al.,
1995). These totals are much higher than
originally estimated in the earliest national
surveys about the prevalence of mental
illness in the United States, such as the
Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA)
surveys in the 1980s (e.g., Helzer, Robins,
&amp; McEvoy, 1987). Recent stratified sampling
studies are much closer to what Keane
and Penk (1988) predicted 15 years ago
about the prevalence of PTSD when they
argued that PTSD had been underestimated
by the ECA.


Because of added stresses associated
with demands of work, particularly when
occupations at risk for violence are factored
in, it is likely that prevalence of PTSD in the
workplace is higher than these general
population estimates. When work-specific
sites are sampled, rates of lifetime and
current PTSD are found to be higher, as
seen in studies of police, firefighters, and
emergency room medical workers. (See
McFarlane &amp; de Girolamo, 1996, for a discussion
of methodological issues in the
epidemiology of PTSD; also Breslau et al.,
1995; Norris, 1992; Resnick, Kilpatrick,
Dansky, Saunders, &amp; Best, 1993; Wilson &amp;
Keane, 1997.) For those who have been
injured at work, symptoms of PTSD are
widespread: Among a sample of workers'
compensation patients, one third had three

[p. <i>219</i>]

PTSD expressed in the workplace may
differ from symptoms registered when seeking
treatment in clinics. For example, the
most common symptoms reported among a
sample of traumatized workers' compensation
applicants were difficulty sleeping
(75%), loss of a sense of future (68%),
diminished interest or pleasure (64%), and
anger (57%). Nearly a third reported persistence
of three or more symptoms. At least
20% wanted to seek professional help for
problems continuing after exposure to
trauma (Burgess et al., 1996).


But PTSD does not inevitably result
when trauma is experienced (Finlay-Jones,
1981). In fact, trauma occurs more frequently
than does PTSD: The National
Comorbidity Survey reports that 61% of
men and 51% of women say they have
experienced trauma in their lifetime, compared
with 6% to 12% who claim they
meet PTSD criteria currently. Moreover,
trauma may produce disorders in addition
to, or other than, PTSD. Depression and
substance abuse frequently co-occur with
PTSD, as do other kinds of anxiety disorders
and phobias. The age at which trauma
is experienced may also influence the likelihood
of developing PTSD, although the
direction of and causal mechanism for any
such effect are uncertain. Some research
suggests that childhood traumas are more
likely to result in a different form of
PTSD--Complex PTSD, or "Disorders of
Extreme Stress"--that shares only some
symptoms, which some authors refer to as
Simple PTSD (e.g., Herman, 1991; Pelcovitz
et al., 1997). Other studies indicate that
traumatic events early in life result in higher
rates of PTSD than when they occur later in
life. (See McFarlane, 1996, for a discussion
of resilience, vulnerability, and course of
PTSD as a disorder.)


Such methodological difficulties in estimating
accurately the prevalence of PTSD,
along with problems in determining
Lifetime versus Current PTSD or Simple
versus Complex PTSD distinctions, should
not distract from the fundamental point:
PTSD is a reality. PTSD is found in the
workplace. Events in the workplace can
cause PTSD. Workplace events can exacerbate
PTSD. Prevalence of workplace PTSD
is likely to be higher than for the general
population. So, PTSD is a reality for which
management and clinicians should prepare.
All work environments must prepare for
trauma, a point underscored most recently
by the events of September 11 and subsequent
anthrax scares resulting in workplace-related
deaths. Failure to create a
work environment that cares and treats
leads to an impaired workforce, increasing
the potential for lower productivity and
poor functioning in the workplace.

<b>Assessment</b>

Several clinical tools have been developed
for research and clinical purposes in assessing
PTSD. All such measures were crafted in
medical settings to test for residuals of combat
trauma, early childhood physical and
sexual assaults, and other forms of trauma
outside the work environment. More recent
assessment techniques were developed for
victims of crime and survivors of natural
disasters. Assessment instruments may be
divided into groups based on what they
assess: those that document the experience
of a traumatic event (Criterion A) and those
that document the reaction to and impact of
that event (Criteria B, C, and D). These

[p. <i>220</i>]

This brief review will not teach the
mental health provider all that he or she
must know to match the needs of the
workplace assessment situation with the
available instruments that will be clinically
useful (see Clark, Crawford, Giles, &amp; Nash,
1987). Most instruments fail to identify the
workplace as a potential site of traumatic
stress or as an environment that exacerbates
preexisting or co-occurring nonworksite
traumas. Nevertheless, mental health practitioners
providing services in occupational
settings will need to adapt existing instruments
to the workplace. That is, clinicians
must find ways to explicitly link Criteria B,
C, and D symptoms to workplace traumas
and Stressors of Criterion A.


So, in adapting any existing measures of
PTSD, clinicians assessing workplace
trauma must take special care to link any
statement about symptoms to whether or
not the trauma in question was experienced
at the workplace or outside of the workplace.
One excellent example of this
approach, which serves as an exception to
the many trauma measures that fail to refer
to the workplace, is Horowitz, Wilner, and
Alvarez's (1979) Impact of Event scale. This
measure starts with an open-ended question
about the type of trauma and where it
occurred, and then proceeds by linking personal
reactions, such as intrusiveness of
memories and avoidance of reminders to
trauma, to the trauma listed originally. John
Wilson's and Terence Keane's recent book,
<i>Assessing Psychological Trauma and PTSD</i>
(1997), provides specific steps that mental
health providers can take to develop an
assessment approach tailored to the differing
needs of various workplaces (e.g., Weiss &amp;
Marmar, 1997).


<i><b>Instruments That Assess Criterion A:
The Traumatic Event</b></i>


A number of instruments are available,
ranging from those targeting only one type
of trauma, such as natural disasters (Norris,
1992), to those covering a broad menu of
possible trauma. We will focus on the
instruments that cover an array of trauma,
with a special focus on those that address
trauma with a potential link to work settings.
In general, measures tapping the
broadest array of trauma include more
items addressing types of trauma that can
occur at work. Most of the scales include
items related to physical or sexual assault,
natural disasters, and combat, but only a
few include items such as industrial accidents,
toxin exposures, or handling of bodies
or accident victims. Items about terrorist
attacks in workplaces undoubtedly now
will begin to appear, along with items about
biochemical warfare in the workplace.


The Traumatic Events Questionnaire
(TEQ) assesses 11 specific traumatic events,
a number of which can occur in work settings
(see Table 11.1). There are sufficient
empirical data to suggest that the measure is
adequately reliable (Lauterbach &amp; Vrana,
1996). Endorsement rates of TEQ items
were relatively high in the initial validity
study done with college students, raising
questions about an overendorsement bias.


The Traumatic History Questionnaire
(THQ) is the longest of the published measures
of traumatic events. with 24 items
addressing a wide range of traumatic experiences,
some of which do not quality for the
diagnosis of PTSD. A number of items are
relevant to trauma that can occur at work,

[p. <i>221</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I021&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The Traumatic Stress Schedule (TSS) was
developed as a short screening instrument for
use with the general population. The range of
items is somewhat brief but focuses on the
most common severe traumatic events.
Reliability and validity data have been generally
supportive of its use (Norris, 1992),
although some of the items may be too
limited to pick up other forms of common
trauma. In general, the instrument is brief and
has more validity data than others, but it may
be limited for use with the type of trauma that
may occur at work. The events of September
11 and the subsequent anthrax scare most
certainly will expand the range of types of
trauma that will be assessed in the workplace.


<b><i>Instruments Measuring
Criteria B, C, and D:
Impact of Trauma</i></b>


These tools are designed to measure the
symptoms of intrusion of the experience
into current experience (Criterion B),
avoidance of stimuli related to the trauma
(Criterion C), and autonomic hyperarousal
(Criterion D). A large number of scales
have been offered for this task (Norris &amp;
Riad, 1997), with a wide variation in
length, format, and validation research.
The range of instruments allows a clinician
or researcher to select one that will meet
the specific needs of the target population
and situation. There are reviews of the
range of instruments elsewhere. We will
offer a few of the most common, well-researched
instruments suitable to different
settings.


The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) was
developed for research into the impact of
rape, but it can be used with the range of
trauma (see Table 11.2). It has 17 items
drawn from the description of PTSD in the
<i>DSM-III-R</i>. Four items focus on Criterion B

[p. <i>222</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I022&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

In some settings, the PTSD scale of the
MMPI-2 will be particularly useful. The
MMPI-2 is a long but widely used measure
of psychopathology. A subscale has been
developed for measuring PTSD symptomatology
(Keane, Malloy, &amp; Fairbank, 1984).
The advantage of this instrument is its solid
reliability and validity, as documented by
a number of published studies (Lyons &amp;
Keane, 1992; Watson, Juba, Maniford,
Kucala, &amp; Anderson, 1991). In addition,
inclusion of the rest of the MMPI-2 offers
other data that are often valuable, including
those regarding response biases. Impression
management, such as "faking good" and
"faking bad," is important to measure. The
disadvantage is its length of 46 PTSD items
and the fact that most of the validity studies
have been done with combat veteran populations.
It is probably most appropriate for use
in settings where the MMPI-2 has already
been administered or where the full data
provided by the MMPI-2 would be of value.


The Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale
(Keane, Wolfe, &amp; Taylor, 1987; Norris &amp;
Riad, 1997) is a medium-length self-report
scale that has some important advantages
relative to other scales. Items are distributed
evenly between Criteria B, C, and D. Most
are tied directly to the traumatic event,
providing some protection against confusing
general symptoms of distress with those
related to the trauma. The reliability and
validity of the scale has been supported
empirically, including the validity of a
Spanish as well as English version.


Similar to the PSS, the PTSD Interview
is tied closely to the diagnostic criteria for
PTSD. It is a brief interview that can be
administered by nonclinicians. Its reliability
and validity have been well-established in
studies of veteran populations, and it is in
wide use today.


It is essential to note that no measures
exist for assessing Criterion F, that set of
indicators that evaluates the impact of
PTSD on occupational and social functioning.
Neither are there measures for the
phasic quality of PTSD, as well as Lifetime
versus Current differentiations--except for
the Structured Clinical Interview for <i>DSM-IV</i> (SCID),
Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS), and the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Reliability and
validity of these measures, wirh references,
are presented in Weiss (1997). Such lacks
represent opportunities for further development
when PTSD researchers focus on the
workplace as a site for study.

[p. <i>223</i>]

PTSD is now proliferating. The PILOTS

resource for deciding which instruments
are most suitable for one's specific situation.

A final note: Developing measures of
PTSD in the workplace--whether caused by
traumatic events at work or whether
stresses in the workplace exacerbate past,
non-work-incurred traumas--is a challenge
for the next generation of PTSD researchers.
Why has assessment of workplace
trauma and work as exacerbation of nonwork
trauma been underdeveloped? Perhaps
it is due to convenience, because most
mental health providers deliver services in
treatment centers. However, as mental
health practitioners increasingly provide
services in the workplace, opportunities will
arise to develop measures of PTSD specific
to work environments.

<b>Clinical Picture</b>

For most people, work provides a setting for
activities from one third to one half of one's
waking hours. This simple fact means that
experiences during this portion of the day
can play an important role in the generation,
continuation, and resolution of psychiatric
disorders. The potential for influence of
PTSD in the workplace is heightened by the
nature of PTSD symptoms. Although occupational
dysfunction due to PTSD is now
a part of its operational definition (i.e.,
Criterion F), the nature of the primary
symptoms help to explain why this dysfunction
occurs. Those with PTSD reexperience
at least some aspects of the traumatic event.
Such a propensity means that many features
of the workplace may have a psychoactive
element. In addition, reexperiencing through
dreams or reliving the event may increase
feelings of anxiety that interfere with optimal
work performance.


Avoidance is also a symptom that can
directly cause problems at work. Efforts
that ensue from this symptom to avoid
thoughts, people, activities, and places that
arouse traumatic recollections can interfere
with carrying out a full range of workplace
duties in a reliable manner. The emotional
detachment from others, which is another
form of avoidance, can also interfere with
the maintenance of productive relationships
with coworkers. Symptoms of increased
arousal that accompany PTSD may have a
more insidious effect on work performance.
Disturbed sleep, difficulty concentrating,
hypervigilance, and irritability each can
diminish work performance in a way that is
likely to be misperceived as evidence of
inadequate ability or motivation.


In spite of these common elements in
the diagnosis of PTSD, symptoms of
PTSD--as well as the type and amount of
risk for PTSD-vary substantially across
different work settings and between different
people. Such variation must be taken
into account by managers who seek to minimize
the potential workplace impact of
those suffering from PTSD. Timing of PTSD
symptoms in relation to the precipitating
traumatic event(s) must also be taken into
account: Acute PTSD, with symptoms that
last for no more than 3 months, is a much
more common response to trauma than
chronic PTSD and may require only temporary
adjustments in workplace procedures
and expectations. On the other hand,

[p. <i>224</i>]

The following two case studies illustrate
some of these differences in the ways
that PTSD can influence different employees
and the places in which they work. They are
selected from our clinical practice to highlight
the themes about PTSD described here:
The signs of PTSD appear at work, fellow
workers have a responsibility to create a
caring environment, work itself may be
used to assuage symptoms, untreated PTSD
may lead to lower productivity, and management
must develop mechanisms to treat
trauma in the workplace.


<b><i>Case Example 1</i></b>


The first case focuses on a manager
who experienced traumatic events in the
Vietnam War and is still haunted by these
memories. He has been an effective worker,
but his work style is shaped by his ongoing
struggle with symptoms of PTSD. This
coping strategy failed him when an unusual
event, an invitation to a Memorial Day
ceremony, created a crisis.


In many ways, Tom Livingston (pseudonym)
was a model employee. He was
devoted to his work as a manager in an
aerospace corporation. He came to work
early and left late. He seemed to want the
company to succeed more than most other
employees--even more than some of his
bosses. This made some people uncomfortable,
but generally resulted in a great
deal of praise and success for Tom.
Everyone knew Tom as a "go-getter"--
someone who could get the job done. That
is why his manager was particularly concerned
when Tom's wife called to say that
he was in the hospital for a week.


His manager had imagined a heart
attack might be in Tom's future, given
how hard he pushed himself. But she was
shocked to find out that Tom was in a
psychiatric hospital. Their long friendship
made it easier for her to find out some of
the details. She called Tom's wife at home
at the end of the week to check on how
Tom was doing, hoping that his wife
would let her know more than she had the
right to request. She did.


His wife did not seem surprised that
Tom was in the hospital. She described his
"problem" as a long-standing one. "It is
always the worst around Memorial Day.
He gets so tense and irritable, I just try to
stay away from him. But this year, he got
an invitation to a special awards ceremony
at our Town Hall to receive an award for
decorated war veterans. They wanted him
to wear his uniform and his medals. That
would make most people so happy, but
not him. It put him over the edge."


Ever since his involvement in the
Vietnam War, Tom has carried an emotional
burden. His memories from the war
haunt him at night. He has dreams about
combat and the deaths of his friends several
nights each week. He rarely sleeps
more than 6 hours. His wife and children
do not know what the traumatic experiences
were; he refuses to talk about them.
They just know that he seems somewhat
distant as a husband and a father. And they
know that they should not ask too many
questions if they want to avoid tension.


Coworkers see him as irritable, with
the potential for angry outbursts. His subordinates
respect his hard work but are
afraid of displeasing him. He has burned
out several administrative assistants, who
could not keep up with his demands. Some
staff call him the "Tasmanian devil," more
for his energy level than for his potential
for destructiveness. He is on the move at
all times, always pushing himself and others
toward work goals. It is not surprising that
he has garnered a great deal of praise and
respect, but those who work closely with
him know that he needs to keep pushing
even when his efforts are not tied to clear
company objectives.



[p. <i>225</i>]

There is a downside for his work,
although it is not often noticed because of
the amount he accomplishes. At times, his
anxiety makes it difficult for him to focus.
He makes decisions that reflect such lack
of focus--decisions that do not incorporate
new information or careful planning.
His hard driving style causes strain in
some work relationships. Some good
employees who have been transferred to
his supervision have subsequently left the
company. And then there is his drinking,
which has never been a clear problem, but
has left some people wondering. Overall,
however, Tom's investment in work is so
high that these problems are overlooked
by those around him.


Up to this point, work had allowed
Tom to maintain a tenuous grasp on his
PTSD symptoms. The invitation to the
Memorial Day ceremony pushed him over
the edge. The anxiety was too much, and he
had to enter the hospital for crisis management.
This crisis presents an opportunity
for him to get real treatment for PTSD,
which could give him relief from his anxiety.
There is also the chance that he will
have difficulty recovering from this drop in
his functioning. Further hospitalizations
could occur, as well as further losses in
work.


<b><i>Case Example 2</i></b>


The second case illustrates problems
resulting from PTSD generated by traumatic
experiences at work. After these experiences,
the employee's work performance
declined gradually as her anxiety about
traumatic experiences and reminders of
them increased. Finally, she was classified
as disabled and left work.


Michelle Barnes (pseudonym) always
wanted to work as a policewoman or as a
female firelighter. She wanted to be where
"the action is." When she began training
for Emergency Medical Technician certification,
she could tell that this type of work
was a perfect match for her.


Her first 5 years working for a private
ambulance company in downtown
Baltimore were impressive. She performed
well and was well liked and respected by
coworkers and supervisors. On at least
two occasions, she had performed well in
dangerous situations. In one particularly
difficult situation, she was fired upon and
almost killed while saving an attempted
murder victim.


Surprisingly, Michelle's work performance
has declined over the past
12 months. She has taken a lot of sick
leave and has appeared less energetic at
work. Her direct supervisor feels that she
is slower to respond to calls.


Michelle's job, like many jobs,
involves significant risk of traumatization,
whether through being in situations that
are dangerous to the employee or working
directly with victims of trauma. There has
probably been a cumulative effect of all
the work for Michelle, but the incident in
which she was almost killed has become
the focus for the present symptoms of
PTSD. Like most adults who are traumatized
by incidents at work, the tendency to
avoid stimuli associated w¡th the trauma
results in a decline in work performance.
Michelle gets anxious whenever she hears

[p. <i>226</i>]

Michelle's employer had not taken
appropriate steps to deal with employees
who suffer trauma, particularly in the
workplace. Employee training for trauma
and PTSD was inadequate, so Michelle did
not understand her symptoms and did not
know what response to make. Her supervisor
was not well trained in how to monitor
employees who had suffered trauma,
so he did not know what to look for or
how to respond effectively. There was no
regular screening or prevention plan in
place. In the end, Michelle was lost to the
company. After 2 years of declining performance,
she filed for disability due to
depression and anxiety, which were eventually
diagnosed accurately as symptoms
of PTSD.

<b>Precipitating Conditions</b>

In the case of PTSD, as described at length
earlier, anytime a person experiences, witnesses,
and confronts an event or events
that involve actual or threatened death or
serious injury, or a threat to the physical
integrity of the person and/or others, that
person has been exposed to a precipitating
condition that potentially may be associated
with the development of PTSD. (See
Criterion A above and the discussion of
measures of traumatic events.) Additionally,
the person must have made a response to
such an event or events that indicates
intense fear, helplessness to do anything to
avoid dying, or horror. This additional
element brings in a psychological dimension
to the operational definitions of <i>precipitating
condition</i> and <i>workplace stressor</i>.


Precipitants of PTSD in the workplace
may include being attacked; being sexually
assaulted or raped; being in a fire or flood
or other form of natural or manmade disaster,
including exposure to chemicals and
toxins; being in a bad accident or in an
industrial accident; experiencing combat;
being threatened with a weapon or being
intimidated or sexually harassed by fellow
employees; or seeing someone being badly
injured or killed in the workplace. Threats
to one's employment, which in turn threatens
one's physical and psychological integrity,
can also be experienced as a form of
trauma; such precipitants vary over time with
larger economic factors, as well as between
workplaces.


Although many of these precipitating
conditions may be experienced in any workplace,
the likelihood of such experiences
varies widely between occupations and
workplaces (McFarlane &amp; de Girolamo,
1996). The greatest risks for trauma occur
for employees who work in settings where
they may witness injuries to fellow workers
and/or experience actual injuries themselves,
even seeing death or causing death
(e.g., Feinstein &amp; Dolan, 1991; Flannery,
Hanson, &amp; Penk, 1994; Flannery, Hanson,
Penk, &amp; Flannery, 1994; Gleser, Green, &amp;
Winget, 1981; Green, 1993; Holen, 1993;
Resnick, Falsetti, Kilpatrick, &amp; Freedy,
1996; Resnick et al., 1993; Shalev, Peri,
Schreiber, &amp; Caneti, 1996; Weisaeth, 1989,
1993, 1994; Weisaeth &amp; Eitinger, 1993).
People who work as police officers and
firefighters are frequently placed in life-threatening
situations (Fullcrron &amp; Ursano,
in press; Gersons &amp; Carlier, 1994). Other
employees, such as emergency workers and

[p. <i>227</i>]

Lower exposure to trauma occurs in
work environments in which employees are
merely aware of destruction and loss (e.g.,
Baum, Gatchel, &amp; Schaeffer, 1983; Green,
1993; Kaltrieder, Gracie, &amp; LeBreck, 1992;
Karlehagen et al., 1993; Marmar, Weiss,
Metzler, Ronfeldt, &amp; Foreman, 1996;
Paton, 1990). Other work environments are
characterized by higher exposure, such as
when employees observe that they were
vulnerable to but did not actually experience
injury (Alexander, 1993; Fullerton,
McCarroll, Ursano, &amp; Wright, 1992;
McCarroll, Ursano, Fullerton, &amp; Lundy,
1995; McCarroll et al., 1993).


The potential for workplace-based generation
of PTSD in settings where traumatic
events are less common should not be underestimated,
because systematic training and
preparation for trauma can lessen the likelihood
that traumatic experiences result in
PTSD symptoms (Freeman, 2000). A serious
accident or shooting may take a far greater
toll on those who have not anticipated the
event than on those for whom traumatic
experience is expected (van der Kolk,
McFarlane, &amp; van der Hart, 1996).


There is also potential for the workplace
to generate PTSD through an indirect
rather than a direct route, when the workplace
stimulates other maladies that
themselves increase the risk of PTSD.
Perhaps the most common such indirect
pathway is substance abuse. Occupations
that facilitate or even encourage drinking
tend to have higher rates of substance
abuse. In turn, substance abusers are more
likely to experience traumatic events and so
have substantially elevated rates of PTSD
(Cottler, Compton, Mager, Spitznagel, &amp;
Janca, 1992). Health care professions that
increase exposure to psychoactive drugs
may have elevated rates of PTSD as a result
of a similar indirect causal process.


None of these risks can be understood
fully without attention to the backgrounds
and preexisting vulnerabilities that employees
bring with them into the workplace. Risk
factors for PTSD have not been researched as
well as those for other anxiety disorders, and
evidence is inconclusive about the importance
of pretrauma background in the etiology of
PTSD. In fact, debate is heated concerning
the relative role of the traumatic experience
itself (e.g., van der Kolk, McFarlane, &amp; van
der Hart, 1996). Nevertheless, it is clear that
the composition of the workforce is consequential.
Limited research suggests a genetic
link: In a study of Vietnam-era veterans who
were twins, genetic factors were estimated to
account for about 30% of the variance in risk
to develop PTSD symptoms (e.g., van der
Kolk, McFarlane, &amp; van der Hart, 1996).
Employees who have experienced psychiatric
disorders are more likely to have been diagnosed
with PTSD, to react with PTSD symptoms
to workplace trauma, and to continue
to evidence PTSD symptoms throughout
their work experience (Breslau &amp; Davis,
1992). The link is not only in susceptibility to
developing PTSD symptoms in response to a
trauma, but also in the likelihood of being
exposed to trauma, with the underlying factor
probably being shared personality traits
associated with behaviors that expose people
to trauma.

[p. <i>228</i>]

So, even though a work environment
may rate low in exposure to trauma,
employees could rate high in their history of
experiences of life-threatening events. And
even so-called safe work environments
might contain cues reminding workers with
PTSD about traumas experienced away
from the workplace. Each workplace is a
complex environment. Some workplaces can
actually lead to traumatic events that result
in PTSD. Other workplaces may inadvertently
provide reminders about non-work-incurred
traumas, exacerbating symptoms
of prework traumas. Still other workplaces,
by the nature of the intensity of the work,
may attract risk takers, whereas other workplaces,
because of lower stress levels, may
attract highly traumatized people seeking
presumably safe working environments.


Variability in susceptibility to PTSD
serves as an important limiting factor in
assessing the relative risk that a workplace
poses for PTSD. In fact, the National
Comorbidity Survey showed that the prevalence
of Current PTSD approached 10%
in the general population and identified
fully 50% as having experienced or witnessed
trauma.

<b>Course and Prognosis</b>

<b><i>Course of PTSD</i></b>


PTSD can occur at any age, and its
course can be variable. Symptoms may
begin appearing several months after experiencing
trauma, but in some instances, the
course of the disorder may be delayed and
may not appear for many years. Delayed
appearance is illustrated by the frequent
observation that many World War II veterans
did not evidence PTSD publicly until
they retired from work or underwent a challenging
physical examination for a medical
condition much later in life. The term
<i>acute</i> is applied to the disorder when symptoms
persist for less than 3 months; <i>chronic</i>
refers to symptoms appearing more than
6 months after the trauma; and <i>delayed</i>
onset is classified any time PTSD symptoms
appear more than 6 months after experiencing
trauma.


There is evidence that PTSD is a phasic
disorder, that is, it is not as salient when a
person's life situation is controllable, but it
recurs intensely when there are physical and
psychological weaknesses or difficulties in
handling the daily hassles of living or when
positive supports and reinforcers are withdrawn.
The disorder is noted as having a
time-related, phasic quality associated with
reminders about the initial traumatic event
or events--an "anniversary" reaction, as
illustrated earlier in the first case example
with the resurgence of memories around
Memorial Day or around the date when the
trauma occurred originally.


Features of the workplace can also
affect the course and expression of PTSD
symptoms. Whether PTSD has its roots in
the workplace or has been brought into
work from outside, the perceptions, feelings,
and vulnerabilities resulting from
PTSD will influence interactions with
coworkers as well as reactions to many
aspects of the work experience. In fact,
McFarlane's (1989) study of fire fighters in a
disaster indicates that post trauma life
events--including what happens at work--
may themselves have more impact on the
continuing experience of PTSD symptoms
than the trauma itself after 2 years. Individuals
with PTSD also tend to be more prone
to anger, which is then likely to result in
more workplace problems (Fruch, Henning,
Pellegrin, &amp; Chobot, 1997).


Moos's (1994) conceptualization of
workplace social climate identifies workplace
features that are likely to be of particular

[p. <i>229</i>]

The reduced sense of mastery, even helplessness,
that often accompanies PTSD is
likely to be worse in an environment that
allows little employee autonomy and maintains
a high level of work pressure (Moos's
"personal growth" area). Concerns with
personal safety, high levels of anxiety, social
withdrawal, and a tendency to negative
self-evaluations often accompany PTSD
(Fogarty &amp; Beck, 1995). These concerns are
likely to be heightened in workplaces that do
not provide basic levels of clear procedures
and physical comfort (Moos's "system maintenance"
area). In general, to the extent
that the workplace fails to provide social
supports, modulated affect, and a protected
environment, the potential for exacerbation
of PTSD symptoms is heightened and the risk
for continuation of the disorder prolonged.


<b><i>Prognosis for PTSD</i></b>


With regard to the prognosis and treatment
of PTSD, there is the proverbial good
news and bad news.


The good news is that clinicians have an
empirical basis for concluding that PTSD is
a treatable disorder. This conclusion is
empirically validated, not just by clinical
practice and clinical observations, but by
well-designed clinical studies based upon
randomized, well-controlled clinical trials.
A summary of these findings appears in Foa
et al. (2000). This is a landmark volume in
the treatment of PTSD, assessing the state of
the science and the art of treatment. The
section below on recommended data-based
treatment is based on information from the
International Society for Traumatic Stress
Studies (ISTSS) Task Force, which produced
practice guidelines for treating PTSD.


There is bad news, however. Evaluations
of various techniques for treating PTSD are
still in their infancy. Studies that empirically
validate PTSD treatment effectiveness are
still rudimentary and evolving. Techniques
have not been tested for the generalizability
of their findings across populations.
Comparisons between types of treatment, to
determine which are more effective for
whom, have not been done. Results do not,
as yet, yield the kind of findings by which
clinicians can select, with confidence, which
type of treatment to offer for what kind of
trauma, for what kind of person, at what
level of stage in recovery. And, most important,
most of the treatment studies have
been conducted with treatment-seeking
samples in clinical settings. Few treatment
studies have been completed on work-related
and/or work-exacerbating trauma.
Randomized clinical trials are needed to
determine which of the empirically validated
PTSD treatments are most effective
for trauma experienced in work environments
and/or for the residuals of trauma
brought to the work environment.


But even the bad news is not really that
bad. It is bad only in the sense that a mere
20 years have passed since PTSD was clearly
formulated as a diagnostic disorder, and that
most PTSD studies completed to date have

[p. <i>230</i>]

<b><i>Toward Developing Referral
Strategies for PTSD</i></b>


Referral strategies can be readily
imported to worksites from agencies that
have already developed practice guidelines
for PTSD treatment, such as the Veterans
Health Administration (see VHA, 1997,
1999). However, the most comprehensive
is the aforementioned guidelines commissioned
by the ISTSS (see Foa et al., 2000).
Both VHA and ISTSS sources guide the
treatment section in this chapter on the
impact of PTSD in the workplace.


PTSD treatment should be tailored to
fit each person's individual circumstances.
No one treatment is suitable for all traumatized
people. Individual differences in PTSD
vary so enormously that clinicians have but
one recourse; that is, to proceed on the basis
that if you have seen one case of PTSD, you
have seen one case of PTSD. No two cases
are going to be alike. No two cases are going
to need the same kind of treatment.


Factors accounting for individual differences
are many and varied and include
some of the following: age at which trauma
occurred (the earlier the trauma, the more
complex the presentation is likely to be);
type of trauma; time when treatment is initiated
relative to the traumatic event;
comorbidities (either those caused by the
trauma or already existing at the time
trauma occurred, mainly depression and
substance use disorders); interactions
between current work environment and
past traumas; conflicts persisting at work, if
and when trauma occurred at work; conflicts
between work environment and current
trauma away from the worksite, as in
cases of domestic violence.


All of these factors, as well as others,
have been demonstrated as contributing
to variations in PTSD and as meriting an
individually tailored treatment plan.


<i>Preventing PTSD:
Creating a Caring Environment</i>


We believe that mental health professionals
must work with management and
with employees to create a caring work
environment aimed at the prevention of
PTSD. Clinicians, whether employed by
management or working directly for clients,
have, as their primary objective, to promote
the human welfare. Thus, decisions about
treating PTSD are centered on improving
the well-being and productivity of the
worker who has been traumatized at work
or whose symptoms appear at, or are exacerbated
in, the worksite.


The recent establishment of the Office
for Homeland Security, currently under
the leadership of the former governor of
Pennsylvania, Thomas Ridge, may help
sensitize all employers and employees to the
importance of creating safe working environments.
Although the motivation for the
creation of the Office for Homeland Security
derives from the events of September 11 and
the anthrax scare, another possible effect
will be to generalize our efforts on behalf of
workplace safety to all kinds of threats and
traumas, no matter what their source.


First steps in referral strategies include
ensuring patient safety and then establishing
a therapeutic alliance and trust. Unfortunately,
traumatic events experienced in the
workplace are not the best circumstances

[p. <i>231</i>]

Management, with or without mental
health providers, needs to conceptualize any
treatment within a relationship that ensures
employee safety and elicits employee trust,
even though such objectives may be difficult
to attain. As a consequence, the first step in
treating PTSD is prevention, and deploying
those intervention techniques that are
demonstrated as effective in prevention.


Thus, it is necessary to think about
treatment in terms of a caring organization
that formalizes, in advance, structures
targeted to cope with employees who have
been traumatized--structures that are formalized
around referrals, peer support, professional
help, and follow-up. We conclude
that the first step in referral strategies for
management is to invest resources into the
individuals who form the company's or
agency's human capital. Management must
create a work environment that cares--not
just for the physical but also for the psychological
well-being of workers. As mentioned
earlier, Moos (1994) has developed measures
for determining the health status of
the social climate of businesses and agencies,
and we suggest that management test
the psychological health of the work environment
regularly and routinely.


Treatment goals for those suffering
from PTSD include reducing psychological
arousal, restoring a reasonable sense of
mastery over the environment, maintaining
caring attachments, and encouraging a
meaningful purpose for life (Flannery,
1992). Clinicians should help employees
suffering from PTSD, particularly those
returning to work after PTSD-induced
absences, to review possible stressors in the
work environment and to develop tailored
coping strategies (Fogarty &amp; Beck, 1995). In
the early stages of recovery, work environments
that pose threats to personal safety
and do not offer caring attachments should
be avoided. When this is not possible, ongoing
support outside the workplace, whether
through familial or therapeutic relationships
or self-help groups, are particularly important
(Jackson-Malik, 1987). In later stages
of recovery, for those suffering from chronic
PTSD, a workplace that also offers some
degree of job autonomy and meaningful
work will facilitate the recovery process.
Because the needs of people in recovery from
PTSD or other disorders change over time
(Creamer, Burgess, &amp; Pattison, 1992), some
mobility between jobs or changes in existing
jobs may be required.


Managers who seek to lessen the adverse
impact of PTSD can benefit from programs
focused directly on helping employees deal
with stress, whatever its source. Programmatic
efforts such as Flannery's (1990, 1992)
SMART self-help approach to becoming
stress resistant can reduce the frequency and
magnitude of PTSD symptoms. Companies
that invest in techniques to increase stress
resistance find that gains far outweigh costs
(e.g., Flannery, 1998).


Managers of working environments are
also advised to prepare their workforce for
the possibilities of trauma occurring in the
workplace. Programmatic interventions
preparing to deal with traumas in the
workplace have been developed by many
mental health organizations. One empirically

[p. <i>232</i>]

ASAP also embodies principles of
Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (Freeman,
2000; Mitchell, 1983; Mitchell &amp; Everly,
1995). Reviews of such psychological
debriefing techniques are mixed, and outcome
data are meager. However, Bisson,
McFarlane, and Rose (2000) conclude in
their review that, when offered as part of a
comprehensive management program by
experienced mental health clinicians, psychological
debriefing interventions are
indeed valuable--as prevention, as preparation,
and as necessary when any form of
trauma occurs in the workplace.

<b>Data-Based Treatments</b>

Reviews of the literature on PTSD treatment
(e.g., Foa et al., 2000) suggest that
management has the responsibility to
provide resources for determining if and
when specialized interventions are needed,
either as follow-up after trauma has occurred
in the workplace or when workplace stressors
exacerbate residuals of trauma previously
experienced. Prevention techniques
and worker preparation can go only so far.
Specialized services to treat residuals of
trauma are needed. Models of referrals for
such specialized services include Employee
Assistance Programs (EAPs) and Human
Resources units within the workplace that
refer traumatized workers to consulting
mental health specialists.


A range of empirically validated treatments
is available. Effectiveness of these
techniques has been established, at least at
the Level C criteria developed by the
Agency of Health Care Policy and Research
(AHCPR) for determining treatment effectiveness,
where Level C refers to evidence
based upon either clinical observations by
qualified mental health workers or naturalistic
studies without placebo controls or
other comparison groups. Although some
of these specialized treatments have been
studied under well-controlled clinical trials
with random assignment conditions, there
is very little research determining which
treatment works better than another treatment
at different stages of recovery.


<i>Cognitive-behavioral therapies</i> (Rothbaum,
Meadows, Resick, &amp; Foy, 2000) have
received the most attention; to date, at least
eight clinical trials with random assignment
to experimental and control conditions have
been published in peer-reviewed journals.
Results justify use of such techniques, including
those involved with exposure approaches
coupled with systematic desensitization,
cognitive processing therapy, relaxation, and
assertiveness training combined.


<i>Pharmacotherapies</i> are not necessarily
considered the first line of treatment, in

[p. <i>233</i>]

<i>Eye Movement Desensitization and
Reprocessing (EMDR)</i> has yielded promising
results (Chemtob, Tolin, van der
Kolk, &amp; Pitman, 2000). EMDR emerges as
particularly effective in cases of simple
PTSD (i.e., single-event, civilian trauma)
and less so for cases of complex PTSD with
multiple trauma and a history of treatment
resistance.


<i>Group therapy effectiveness</i> is substantiated
at the level of clinical observation and
naturalistic studies, but the results of only
two randomized clinical trials have been
published (Foy et al., 2000). In general, the
findings are positive, but further research is
needed. Group therapies range widely in
type, from supported group therapy, to
psychodynamic group therapy, to cognitive-behavioral
group therapy. Treatment
manuals are under development and are
being evaluated for their treatment
effectiveness.


A number of treatment techniques have
been empirically validated to address other
kinds of psychological disorders. Clinicians
have begun to explore the usefulness of
these techniques in the treatment of PTSD.
For example, only one study of <i>hypnosis</i>,
along with other therapies, has been
reported in the PTSD literature, and findings
were favorable (Cardena, Maldonado,
van der Hart, &amp; Spiegel, 2000). Reviewers
of this literature report an eight-stage
process model of PTSD that has not yet
been subjected to empirical validation. The
authors also present important exclusion
criteria for the use of hypnosis.


Riggs (2000) presents a compelling
argument why <i>marital and family therapies</i>
might prove effective in the treatment of
PTSD. Finding marital and family therapies
useful in addressing other disorders, he
reasons that resolving the problems of
social avoidance and poor communication
should reduce marital and family distress
that is associated with PTSD. The treatment
rationale is persuasive. Techniques such as
emotion-focused marital therapy and supportive
therapy for families of trauma survivors
have been developed. The empirical
validation has not yet been carried out.


Likewise, <i>psychodynamic therapies</i> are
procedurally well developed for the treatment
of PTSD, but their effectiveness awaits
formal evaluation under conditions of randomized,
clinical trials (Kudler, Blank, &amp;
Krupnick, 2000). Techniques vary, from psychoanalysis,
to psychodynamic psychotherapy,
to brief psychodynamic psychotherapy,
to supportive psychotherapy. Most clinicians
agree that comparatively well-adjusted
clients are better candidates for such therapies,
specifically those individuals judged as
ready and capable of forming therapeutic
alliances. Cases of complex PTSD may
require this form of long-term treatment.


<i>Impatient PTSD treatment</i> is offered
primarily through the Veterans Health
Administration. At least 16 outcome studies
have been completed, in the form of
naturalistic evaluations. Results suggest that

[p. <i>234</i>]

Finally, <i>psychosocial rehabilitation
techniques</i> are recommended; their effectiveness
remains to be validated (Penk &amp;
Flannery, 2000). Psychosocial rehabilitation
consists of a range of techniques, from case
management that links traumatized people
to appropriate services, to self-help and
family psychoeducational approaches that
teach survivors how to cope with the
residuals of trauma.


For trauma in the workplace, however,
mental health providers should consider
adapting principles of treating trauma for
the workplace itself (Penk, 2001). Work is
regarded as therapeutic, as Sigmund Freud
(1929) suggested when he wrote, "No other
technique for the conduct of life attaches
the individual so firmly to reality as laying
emphasis on work; for work at least gives
one a secure place in a portion of reality, in
the human community" (p. 59).


Unfortunately, clinical tests of the
hypothesis that work itself is effective in the
treatment of PTSD are just under way.
Benefits of work are frequently noted
during the course of delivering clinical
services, as illustrated in the case of Tom
Livingston, but work as therapy has not
been studied extensively. Nevertheless, naturalistic
studies and clinical observations
are sufficiently compelling that attention is
merited. Vocational rehabilitation services
are used by many adults with psychiatric
disorders to assist in their efforts to return
to work. By comparing groups of adults who
participate in vocational rehabilitation, it is
possible to understand how best to serve
them (see Box 11.2).


As illustrated by outcome data cited in
Box 11.2, but also in the case of Tom
Livingston, who overcompensated for his
symptoms of PTSD by losing himself in his
work, compensated work therapy suggests
that work itself may be beneficial in the
treatment of PTSD. How can work be beneficial
in treating PTSD? Work certainly
addresses a core symptom of PTSD--the
learned helplessness that is a feature of
being traumatized, of not being in control,
of not being able to do anything to save
your life (Fogarty &amp; Beck, 1995). Work
restores a sense of mastery and helps reassure
individuals that they can recover the
capacity to control their lives, a capacity
that is threatened by trauma. Furthermore,
work provides social contacts in most
instances, thereby reducing social isolation
that is a hallmark of the avoidance maneuvers
used to cope with memories of trauma.
Sense of loss of attachments that is associated
with trauma may be assuaged by reintegration
into the workforce. Moreover,
work often provides a sense of purpose, in
contrast to trauma, which may destroy a
person's beliefs in reasons for living. Work
can be a concrete, active form of expressing
that a person has goals in living. Finally,
work--as distinguished from its opposite,
the unemployment commonly found among
psychiatric patients with histories of
trauma--helps tie a person to reality, as
Freud explained so long ago.


<b><i>Time Element of PTSD Treatments</i></b>


Work environments differ in referral
mechanisms for diagnosing and assessing
PTSD. Most employers have no way to refer
clients other than supervisors or coworkers
sensing that something is awry and eventually
building up the courage to confront

[p. <i>235</i>]

<b>Box 11.2 A Study of Vocational Rehabilitation and PTSD</b>


Within the Veterans Health Administration, vocational rehabilitation services are
offered under the rubric of Compensated Work Therapy (CWT). This program is
fairly consistent across sites in its format, using a mixed model of rehabilitation that
includes sheltered workshops, transitional employment and job placement (Losardo,
1999; Seibyl &amp; Rosenheck, 2000). The stated goal of CWT is to help maximize
participant levels of functioning while preparing as many veterans as possible for a
successful return to competitive employment (Losardo, 1999).


The client population is predominantly male, middle-aged veterans, virtually all of
whom have a psychiatric and/or substance abuse problem, with many having additional
medical problems. About 15% to 25% carry a diagnosis of PTSD, depending
on the program. Although this diagnosis is often related to the trauma of combat,
many other forms of trauma have been experienced (Lawson, Drebing, Short,
Vincellette, &amp; Penk, 1998). The majority of participants have a history of vocational
difficulties over many years (Losardo, 1999). Limited evaluation data available on this
program suggest that participation by the average veteran in CWT is associated with
reduced drug and alcohol use, and fewer episodes of homelessness and incarceration,
but with no clear benefit in terms of psychiatric symptoms or stability (Kashner et al.,
2001).


<b>Data Collection</b>


Data used in the current study include information about individuals entering the
CWT program at the Bedford VA Medical Center between 1998 and 1999. The data
concerning CWT participants have been collected routinely for administrative purposes
since 1994 by the Northeast Program Evaluation Center, which monitors all
CWT programs in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). At Bedford, additional
data are collected to document why participants are having difficulty with work, what
they hope to gain by participating in CWT, and other aspects of their participation.


<b>Results</b>


Six hundred and forty participants entered CWT during that time, with 150, or
23%, having a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants diagnosed with
PTSD were not significantly different from other participants in terms of age, education,
or other demographic variables. They were more likely to carry a comorbid diagnosis
of an additional anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder. They were not more likely
to have a comorbid substance abuse problem.


Prior to admission, a majority of both groups have been working competitively. The
participants with PTSD are almost twice as likely as other participants with psychiatric
problems to blame their current unemployment on those psychiatric problems. Similarly,
they are much more likely to state that the reason they are entering rehabilitation is to
work in a setting that enables them to cope with their psychiatric problems.



[p. <i>236</i>]

Once they enter vocational rehabilitation, the PTSD group members participated as
well as other diagnostic group members. On average, they stayed as long and achieved
roughly equivalent "successful discharge" rates as the other groups. They were significantly
more likely than others to participate in the most demanding parts of the program,
where they were placed in jobs in the community, working alongside nonparticipants. In
a prior study we completed with a larger sample of CWT participants from a range of
programs, we found that the participants with PTSD actually were employed at a higher
rate at discharge than were other participants with psychiatric disorders.


<b>Conclusions</b>


These data confirm that adults with PTSD make up a significant portion of the
population of adults seeking vocational rehabilitation because of psychiatric problems.
Compared to participants with other psychiatric disorders, those with PTSD attribute
their work problems more to their psychiatric problems and to the difficulty of staying
in treatment and working. Despite this, they participate in vocational rehabilitation
for the same length of time and tend to be involved in the more demanding parts
of rehabilitation. This may account for the slight advantage seen elsewhere in their
outcome from CWT, in terms of competitive employment.


Several years ago, the VHA developed
screening instruments for use in assessing
all patients referred to its medical centers.
See Attachment A from the VHA's (1997)
guidelines, which contains the screening
instrument along with an algorithm for
deciding when and how to refer people who
may need treatment for PTSD. The VHA
algorithm also provides a summary of the
time elements needed in making decisions
about PTSD treatments.


For larger organizations, like VHA
medical centers, both management and
unions require that departments be created to
assist employees. As a consequence, Human
Resources are established by public law in
VA medical centers, as well as adaptations
of the Employee Assistance Programs. The
VHA system of health care is not the only
organization that is mandated to be a caring
environment for its employees; many businesses
and corporations have their counterparts
to what federal services and military
agencies have been implementing throughout
most of the 20th century.


Those who score positively on the
PTSD screening instrument should be
referred to a practitioner with experience in
treating people with PTSD for purposes of
conducting a more detailed evaluation.
Among the first questions such a practitioner
should ask is whether or not the

[p. <i>237</i>]

Once needs for treatment are established
and needs for inpatient hospitalization
have been ruled out, then the mental
health professional, together with the client,
can begin to develop a treatment plan that
fits in with the patient's current adjustment.


Dynamic psychotherapies (see summary
of treatments above) are recommended for
avoidance and numbing symptoms of PTSD.
Group therapy is recommended for social
alienation, as well as avoidance and numbing
symptoms. Cognitive therapies and
dynamic psychotherapy are recommended
for distorted beliefs associated with PTSD.


Cognitive-behavioral therapies and
psychoeducational methods of anger management
are highly recommended when
affective dysregulation and dissociation--
indicators of Complex PTSD--are present
(see Herman, 1991; van der Kolk,
McFarlane, &amp; Weisaeth, 1996).


When anxiety is prominent in the clinical
picture, particularly physiological
arousal and concurrent anxiety disorder
symptoms, behavioral interventions to
address sleep disturbances, including nightmares,
are essential. Direct therapeutic
exposure is highly recommended for reducing
anxiety and physiological arousal, particularly
for cooperative patients with
strong support groups and capacities to
form therapeutic alliances. Traditional
cognitive and behavioral treatments are
recommended when panic attacks are
co-occurring. For Simple PTSD and
single traumas, EMDR is recommended.
Questions about medication should be
deferred until the symptom picture is wellestablished.


A fundamental problem when planning
treatment for PTSD for workers in the
workplace is that principles of level of care/
rehabilitation have not been developed;
these principles guide clinicians in deciding
the appropriate level of treatment intensity
and requisite involvement of medical intervention.
In other words, nothing equivalent
to the American Society of Addiction
Medicine criteria exist, as adapted for level
of care determination for substance abuse.
The concepts that guide developing and
empirically validating level of care determination
for substance abuse are now
well-documented, but no such empirically
guided decision-making process is available
for any other disorders, much less PTSD.
The field of level of care/rehabilitation determination
is wide open for mental health
professionals to design and implement for
PTSD in the world of work. The time element
for treating PTSD cannot be specified
until clinical guidelines are developed, relative
to low and high levels of intensity of
treatment in inpatient versus outpatient
settings.


<b><i>Side Effects of PTSD Treatments and
Impact on Work</i></b>


Side effects of PTSD treatments are discussed
in detail in Foa et al. (2000) by types
of treatments offered, and they need not be
detailed here other than to note a few obvious
risks. Each of the treatments offered
will have some side effects, the psychosocial
rehabilitation treatments as much as
pharmacotherapy approaches. Friedman
et al. (2000) highlight the importance of
using as few medications as possible (see

[p. <i>238</i>]

Similarly, trauma-focused treatments
based on individual and group approaches
may provide reminders about trauma that
are emotionally disturbing to clients. The
act of remembering traumas that one strives
to forget is likely to produce a period of
emotional distress that, in turn, may be
played out in the workplace when the everyday
hassles of employment could become
exaggerated or overemphasized. Mental
health professionals are advised to develop
treatment plans in which both the workers
who are receiving services and supervisors
are informed--to the extent that personal
privacy permits, and only with the agreement
of those receiving services. Use of
support groups and implementation of
employee-to-employee process groups,
such as the aforementioned ASAP teams
(Flannery, 1998), provide a model for
assisting those receiving services in coping
with side effects of PTSD treatments. In
addition, mental health professionals who
are treating trauma survivors also must
provide support groups for themselves,
because treating trauma may be hazardous
to the provider.


<b><i>Workplace Accommodations
for PTSD Treatments</i></b>


Workplace accommodations for PTSD,
as well as other disorders (such as the high
comorbidity of substance abuse treatment)
are mandated by public laws, such as the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
and by management-union agreements,
as well as in company memoranda of
understanding with employees. Such
accommodations follow blueprints established
long ago (e.g., Roman, 1988), which
have seven basic points:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Supervisors, along with workers,
are trained to implement a "performance
only" identification strategy. That is,
interventions are activated only when job
performance problems, such as higherthan-average
rates of job absence and
lower-than-expected job performance, are
documented as occurring.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Employers should provide consultation
from experts--mental health as well
as business professionals who are experienced
in creating caring environments that
increase job performance and productivity,
and who are knowledgeable about job
stresses and traumas in the workplace.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Employers should develop and then
follow techniques of "constructive confrontation."
That is, management, unions,
and representatives of employees must
develop guidelines and memoranda of
understanding on steps to follow when
performance problems are identified in the
workplace.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Efficient ways of referring should
be developed between (a) individual workers
evidencing performance problems and
(b) treatment services in the community.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. Workplace programs should have
organizational linkages between workplaces
and service providers, including a monitoring
system, so that the employer understands
the effectiveness of its responses to
employee needs as well as stresses produced
in the workplace.
</p>

[p. <i>239</i>]

7. Workplaces should invest resources
into a program coordinator who reports to
management, as an organizational expert,
about the effectiveness of management's
investments in its human capital and on
how the human welfare of its employees has
been nurtured.


As summarized from Roman (1988),
we conclude that the most productive contribution
that mental health professionals
can provide to the workplace is the creation
of worker-to-worker and management-to-worker
programs that are activated at
times of stress and trauma, and at times when
performance interferences are demonstrated
and are identified at work. Managers
should develop plans for dealing with
trauma of any kind before disaster strikes,
and these plans should be reviewed periodically
with staff as routinely as management
conducts its fire drills (Freeman, 2000).
Requirements are stated in greater detail in
other source documents, such as the standards
from the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA). (See, for example,
<i>Guidelines for Preventing Workplace
Violence for Health Care Workers</i>, 1996, in
which "threat assessment" teams conduct
security analyses; survey employees on
potential for violent episodes; monitor
trends for job-related injuries; and review
medical, safety, workers' compensation,
and insurance records for incidents.)

<b>Maintenance of Gains/Relapse Prevention</b>

<b><i>Workplace Strategies for Treating PTSD</i></b>


The guarantee of safety in the workplace
is not just a matter of good business--
it is also mandated by law. Both federal
laws--such as the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970, the American
Disabilities Act of 1991, the National Labor
Relations Acts--and state laws--such as the
workers' compensation acts--specify workplace
strategies for treating PTSD and, by
implication, ways to maintain gains and
prevent relapse after treatment. Such federal
and state laws mandate that employers
have a general duty to provide a workplace
that is free from recognized hazards that
may cause death or serious physical harm--
events associated with PTSD. Employers
can be cited if they violate the general duty
clause that is central to all of the federal and
state legislation guaranteeing workplace
safety--a general duty clause that holds
employers responsible for preventing and
eliminating threats and hazards in the
workplace.


Both NIOSH and OSHA have written
guidelines to prevent and eliminate hazards
in the workplace. Although not always
mandatory, such guidelines include strategies
for dealing with the aftermath of trauma.
OSHA mandates are not promulgated to
interfere with responsibilities of the states to
deal with workers' compensation systems
that provide for job-related injuries and illnesses.
Workers' compensation rules and
regulations are left up to state legislatures
and state courts. But both state and federal
guidelines have been developed to address
residuals of work trauma in terms of lost
production, lost wages, medical expenses,
and disability compensation payments.

[p. <i>240</i>]

Gains from treating trauma in the
workplace will be achieved when the caring
work environment maintains a monitoring
system focusing on how physical and psychological
hazards produce stress and trauma at
the worksite. Employers are advised to assess
productivity in terms of how untreated
hazards impair productivity, as indicated by
the aforementioned lost production, lost
wages, medical expenses, and disability compensation
payments. An accurate accounting
system linking the effects of trauma to
lost production is the best guarantee that
management will take steps to prevent
trauma in the workplace.


Beyond a trauma/lost production system
of monitoring, there are four other
techniques by which management can prevent
and treat the effects of trauma (see
OSHA, 1996):
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Management commitment and
employee involvement in ensuring a
safe and health-promoting work
environment, including zero tolerance
of violence with no reprisals against
employees who report workplace
violence and disasters
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Continual and frequent worksite
analyses as well as employee analyses
to find existing or potential hazards
or potentials for workplace violence
and disasters (this includes the aforementioned
"threat assessment" along
with records for monitoring injuries,
accidents, and episodes of violence)
</p>

<p>
3. Setting up engineering and administrative
work practices to prevent hazards
and workplace violence, such as
security devices, alarm systems, panic
buttons, cellular phones for employees,
restrictions on working alone in isolated
worksites, and so on
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>
4. Instituting post incidence reporting
systems, based upon employers and
employees working together to create
a caring environment for workers
who have been traumatized (see
Flannery's ASAP model as a blueprint
for dealing with trauma)
(Flannery, 1998)

(Flannery, 1998)


Mental health workers are well-trained
and experienced in developing such strategies
for employers and employees. In addition
to having the skills necessary to create
caring environments, many mental health
workers, such as psychologists, have been
trained in statistics and experimental design
to conduct the cost-for-gain reckoning
needed for ensuring that health-promoting
services are offsetting the costs of lost
productivity.

<b>Summary</b>

PTSD is a hidden problem in the workplace--hidden
because its primary symptom
is avoidance of reminders about the traumas
that caused PTSD; hidden because cooccurring
disorders, such as depression and
substance abuse, obscure its importance as
a reason that workers decline in productivity;
and hidden because many employers tacitly
collude with trauma survivors to not discuss
the life-threatening events that workers
have experienced either in the workplace or
elsewhere.


Untreated PTSD will be evident in the
workplace in many forms of lost productivity:
not doing the work, not performing the
work to standard, not being present to work,
and expressing conflicts with supervisors and
coworkers. Outlined here are steps that mental
health providers, working for the goals of
the organization and for the welfare of
employers and employees alike, can take to

[p. <i>241</i>]

The good news about treating PTSD in
the workplace is that objective, standardized
measures have been developed to identify
PTSD, and treatments are proving to be
effective. Limitations in both the current
state of the art of assessment and treatment
are noted, particularly that most PTSD
measures and treatment techniques have
been developed for traumas other than
those experienced at work, and treatments
are designed for clinics and hospitals rather
than for work.


Based on the time-honored principles of
immediacy, proximity, and expectancy, we
conclude that assessment and treatment of
PTSD in the workplace should be done in the
workplace; that treatment should be done
immediately with follow-up care, involving
peers wherever and whenever possible; that
treatment should be close to the actual work
environment where trauma occurred; and
that treatment should be delivered with the
expectation that the traumatized employee
will return to work as soon as physical and
psychological health permit.


As our nation re-orients itself to the
workplaces that have been the target of terrorist
attacks, clinicians now may reconsider
how to devise and adapt new ways for
diagnosing and treating survivors of trauma
that are specific to the workplace, whatever
the cause of trauma.
