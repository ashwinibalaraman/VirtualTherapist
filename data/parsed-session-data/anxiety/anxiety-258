<font size="4"><b>12: Parenting Chronically III Children: The Scope and Impact of Pediatric Parenting Stress</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


Parenting children with a chronic illness represents an important area of interest for
practitioners and researchers alike. This is because children with long-term medical
problems constitute a significant portion of health care patients, and the stresses faced
by parents raising such children are formidable.


The goal of this chapter is to explore particular issues in parenting that arise when
infants, children, and adolescents experience chronic and/or life-threatening illness. In
addition to describing the emergence of this special area of parenting research, we
review cross-cutting themes in parent-child stress and coping that offer multiple
frameworks in which to understand these complex psychological processes. Along
with a detailed exploration of prior work conducted with parents of children with illnesses
such as diabetes, cancer, and other serious health threats, we discuss the practice
implications of this knowledge.


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


All parents are challenged with the task of
promoting normal, healthy development in their
children. This includes promoting not only
physical growth and maturation, but also social,
emotional, and intellectual development as well.
For parents of children with a chronic illness,
these challenges are intensified, because helping
children to achieve their developmental milestones
must occur within the parameters of the
child's medical adversity. At times, childhood
illness interrupts or delays normal development.
This can result in a widening gap between the
resources, skills, and achievements of ill children
relative to their healthy peers, thereby further
increasing the worries, stresses, and burdens
faced by their parents.


Decades of explanatory behavioral research
on children with chronic illness has brought to
light the unique circumstances that they and their
parents must confront on an everyday basis. As a
result of this body of research, it is widely understood
that pediatric illness and in-patient medical
care are acutely stressful events, and that the
stress associated with these events can profoundly
impact upon long-term outcomes. On a
more positive note, findings from these studies
can also be used to guide clinical practice to

The impact that the illness has on the parent is
thought to play a role in how the child adapts to
the medical adversity (Melamed and Ridley-Johnson,
1988). For example, negative behavioral
and emotional responses (such as anxiety)
on the part of the parent can affect the child's
recovery process (such as observed distress during
medical procedures). Positive associations
between parent and child distress highlight that
family impact is an important consideration for
health care providers and practitioners who work
with children and their family members in these
circumstances. That is, health professionals must
be keenly aware of the behavioral impact of the
illness on the child and on his or her parents
(Chan and Leff, 1982).


<b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</b>


There is a longstanding tradition of health professionals
working closely with parents of chronically
ill children to assist in the management of
disease burden, as well as developmental and
behavioral side-effects. On both sides of the
Atlantic, and in other areas of the world, consultation-liaison
models in child psychiatry and
pediatrics, behavioral pediatrics, and pediatric
psychology have been established and evaluated
(Rothenberg, 1968; Graham, 1994; Roberts and
McNeal, 1995; Rodrigue et al., 1995). Clinical
implementation of these models in hospitals and
out-patient settings helps ensure that the medical
care children receive includes a strong focus on
family life. These approaches also recognize the
importance of the parenting role in promoting
child development under adverse medical conditions,
and minimizing negative child outcomes.
Below, we detail some of the professional
achievements and milestones that led to psychosocially
enhanced children's medical services,
and highlight the richness and diversity of
approaches that have led to the current focus on
the impact of children's illness on parents.


<i>Early Pioneers</i>


In the early 20th century, Arnold Gesell, who
was both a psychologist and physician, wrote and
lectured about psychological principles in pediatric
medicine, and the relationship between
child behavior and development (Gesell, 1940).
It was Gesell who intensively studied infant
mental abilities and later amassed a film library
of observational data on the development of
children from birth through adolescence. As a
result of this work, he identified behavioral
norms occurring within each developmental
phase. This achievement played an important
role in parenting during the 1940s and 1950s, as
many practitioners used this knowledge to identify
children in need of special services.


By the middle of the 20th century, pediatrician
Benjamin Spock's book <i>Common Sense Book of
Baby and Child Care</i> (1946) was published for
the first time. This book would later go on to sell
more than 50 million copies worldwide, and was
translated into more than 30 languages. Spock's
message of patience, tolerance, and love for
children influenced the attitudes and practices of
generations of parents throughout the US, UK,
and other parts of the world.


However, these and other popular resources
primarily concentrated on physically healthy
children; far less was known about parenting in
the face of medical adversity, such as physical
handicaps or chronic illness. Like Gesell, many
believed that the study of normal development
would ultimately lead to a more complete understanding
of deviant processes. Subsequent
advances in medical diagnosis and treatment
would make it possible to explore similar issues
among the chronically ill.


<i><b>Emerging Focus on Physical Illness</b></i>


In the early 1960s, Green and Solnit wrote about
'vulnerable child syndrome'. At its core, this syndrome
described the altered relationship between
parent and child when the child experienced an
acute illness, and was not expected to, yet ultimately
did survive. Green and Solnit (1964)
recognized that children with significant illness
histories would often be viewed by their parents
in a new light as being almost fragile. They
hypothesized that this skewed parental view
would lead to child maladjustment over time. At
the time, this and other early parent-child frameworks
were particularly important because they
helped to set the stage for closer examination of
long-term relationships between parents and
children in the context of medical crisis.


In the latter part of the 20th century, theoretical
models began to emerge that specifically
focused on factors affecting psychosocial adjustment
among children with chronic conditions.
These include a disability-stress-coping model,
and a transactional stress and coping model.
They both emphasized the importance of
parental adjustment and other familial/social

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>THEMES IN CHILD HEALTH,
PARENTING, STRESS AMD COPING</b>


Across all serious pediatric illnesses, there are
five main points to consider when assessing the
social, behavioral, and psychological sequelae of
the illness. The first of these areas, stress faced
by parents, is at the core of this chapter. The
second area, prevalence, tells us how widely
parent-child stress exists within medical settings.
Third are the conceptual models that offer
a framework for understanding complex interactions.
Fourth, natural illness and developmental
processes are important because they underlie
key outcomes of interest. And finally, we
consider the application of our understanding in
each of these areas to determine individual needs
and resources, including the potential for
interventions.


<i><b>Pediatric Parenting Stress</b></i>


'Pediatric parenting stress' is the term we use to
refer to the stress faced by parents of children
with chronic illness (Streisand et al, 2001). We
favor this term over others (for example, 'parenting
stress', 'care-giver burden') because we feel
it more firmly establishes interrelationships
among three central features: (1) child health;
(2) parental roles, responsibility, and burden;
and (3) psychological and behavioral response
and adaptation to illness.


First and foremost, the term 'pediatric'
(though meaning 'related to children' in general)
specifically applies to the development and care
of infants, children, and adolescents with some
type of illness. Second, the term 'parenting' in
this context makes explicit reference to interactions
between parents and their children, and not
just children and a wider range of care-givers,
because of the intensity of the parent-child relationship.
Finally, a substantial body of research
supports the notion that 'stress' - a transactional
process between an individual and his or her
environment - could arise from multiple sources,
including parents' concern related to their
children's health status.


Sources of stress among parents of children
with chronic illnesses include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• negotiating complex health care systems;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• learning to communicate with providers
around the jargon of the child's disease;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• parents' emotional reactions to the child's
diagnosis, illness trajectory, and treatment;
and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• limitations the child's illness may place on
parent role functioning (for example, in their
professional lives and in caring for the ill
child's healthy siblings).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
While areas other than the four mentioned above
certainly contribute to the experience of stress
among parents of children with illness, these are
among the most salient, relevant, and important
to parents' daily lives in this context. To the
extent that stress in these domains can be better
understood, professionals involved in the care of
ill children and their families will be better able
to offer assistance to aid their coping and adaptation.
This goal would include ways to strengthen
the parenting role and general psychological
functioning of parents (Johnston and Marder,
1994).


• negotiating complex health care systems;


• learning to communicate with providers
around the jargon of the child's disease;


• parents' emotional reactions to the child's
diagnosis, illness trajectory, and treatment;
and


• limitations the child's illness may place on
parent role functioning (for example, in their
professional lives and in caring for the ill
child's healthy siblings).


In the absence of professional guidance, some
parents may become so preoccupied with their
child's health risks, as to engage in over-protective
behavior and thus provoke a range of negative
clinical outcomes (Thomasgard and Metz, 1997).
Though some parents internalize their distress in
an attempt to conceal it from the family, others
externalize their feelings in equally unhealthy
ways. Why is it that some parents are more
resilient and ready to take charge when faced
with hospitalization or illness in their child compared
to other parents? Investigations into the
coping mechanisms that underlie such processes
have shed light on this issue, and generate important
ideas for assisting those in greatest need
(Burke et al, 1991).


<b>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BEHAVIOR
PROBLEMS AMONG
CHRONICALLY ILL CHILDREN</b>


It has been estimated that up to 50 per cent of all
general pediatric clinic visits reflect behavioral,
psychological, and educational concerns (Costello,
1986). A range of other studies estimate that
overall prevalence rates of behavioral disturbance
among children seen in primary care are
over 10 per cent (Jellinek et al., 1999). These
findings contribute to growing concerns about

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As mentioned previously, parents are
children's most important health resource, helping
them to manage the illness, while continuously
bringing the child's medical needs to the
attention of health care providers. Parents are an
integral component of the identification and
management of behavioral concerns, and the
nature and quality of their communications with
professionals about such problems often determine
if and when intervention services are
offered (Garrison et al., 1992; Horwitz et al.,
1998). A study by Sharp et al. (1992) of child
health visits concerned with reviewing
children's conditions found that physicians very
often created opportunities for parents and
children to express psychosocial concerns. As
professionals, one of our most important goals
should be to help parents seize upon these
opportunities so that they and their children
receive the care and support they deserve. This
may include offering anticipatory guidance
about what behaviors to expect from a child as
he or she matures with the illness, teaching parenting
strategies to manage negative behavior,
or to provide a referral to a behavior specialist
who can help the parent learn to cope more
effectively.


<i><b>Prevalence</b></i>


Prevalence rates of childhood chronic illness and
disability illustrate the significant proportion of
children affected by these conditions worldwide
(see Table 12.1). While families of children with
an illness contend with a host of physical and
medical demands (for example, invasive procedures,
complex medication regimens, in-patient
hospitalization), many families also face a concomitant
set of child behavioral and psychosocial
complications. Research has consistently demonstrated
that across illness types, parents of
children with an illness experience significant
levels of stress (Goldberg et al., 1990; Eiser et al.,
1991; Quittner et al., 1998; Streisand et al.,
2001). Other sequelae may include conflict with
partners, increased behavioral problems in the
child, uncertainty about the future, and poorer
family functioning.


<i><b>Theoretical Models of Parent,
Child, and Family Adaptation</b></i>


While few families remain unchanged after
experiencing a child's illness, many factors
affect the severity of the impact that the illness
will bring to the child and his or her family.
These models overlap, as they must, since they
describe the same phenomena. Their differences
lie primarily in emphasizing elements, process,
and outcome in these families. Some highlight
the bi-directional influences on the child and
family (Fiese and Sameroff, 1989). Others take
into account how parent-related variables influence
family adaptation (Wallander et al., 1989)
or how influences from other areas, such as the
child's school and community, impact upon
parent or family adjustment (Kazak, 1989).


Parent and family adjustment may also be
related to family characteristics (for example,
adaptability and cohesion; Chaney and Peterson,
1989), parents' perception of the child's health
risk (Youngblut and Shiao, 1993), or other family
demographic characteristics, such as employment
and socio-economic status (Walker et al.,
1989). For example, studies suggest that children
in families with lower levels of cohesion and
adaptability have poorer overall functioning, that
mothers who perceive their children to be at
greater risk experience more distress themselves,
and that working mothers and mothers with
higher household incomes may experience less
distress.


<i><b>Illness Trajectory</b></i>


For those who take a predominantly socialecological
perspective (Kazak, 1989), the illness
itself plays a large role in determining how some
families manage with a child's illness. For example,
an illness associated with a significantly
shortened life expectancy, such as cystic fibrosis,
might engender more significant long-term
worries in parents than an illness that requires
ongoing treatment, yet has a more positive prognosis,
such as asthma.


The stage of the illness, or where children are
in the illness trajectory, also affects how families
respond (Gravelle, 1997). For example, a study
of Chinese parents of children being treated for
cancer found that the diagnosis and terminal
phases of the child's illness were seen as the
most difficult or most stressful time by the families
(Martinson et al., 1997). Even the time
period just prior to the actual diagnosis can be
extremely difficult for families, with parents
wondering why their child's health is failing.

<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I007&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<b><i>Stress and Coping</i></b>


Similar to the social-ecological model, the
disability-stress-coping model (Wallander
et al., 1989) views family members as an
integrated whole, where a medical stressor or illness
influencing the behavior of one individual
has implications for all family members. In this
model, the developmental phase of the child
(infancy, school-age, adolescence), as well as
that of the family (recent marriage or divorce,
new family), affects the impact of the illness. It
is therefore critical for practitioners to consider
both the age and developmental level of the
child, and to be aware of the risks to normal
development faced by children with an illness.
Figure 12.1 outlines the major tasks for children
at different phases of development and the challenges
of the illness at each developmental
phase. These issues are discussed later in the
chapter.


In terms of the implications of stress related to
the illness, it is important to recognize several
lines of evidence which suggest that even subtle,
illness-related variations in parents' stress symptoms
impact upon both the parent and child. For
example, it has been shown that parents caring
for children with physical limitations are at risk
of experiencing poor mental health states
(Wallander et al., 1989). Further, such stress has
been shown to play a role in information learning,
processing, and recall (Gillis, 1993), which
could compromise parental comprehension of,
and adherence to, the child's prescribed treatment.
Stress on the part of parents may also be
directly related to stress subsequently experienced
by children facing health threats
(Melamed and Ridley-Johnson, 1988; Johnson
and Tercyak, 1995), possibly suggesting systemic
family modeling of anxiety and worry.
Finally, elevated stress levels among parenting
figures could negatively impact upon children's
own ability to adhere to their medical regimen
by creating maladaptive preoccupations and

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I008&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br /><a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_caption_20382');">caption</a><div id="_caption_20382" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:1px solid #800000; padding:2px;">Figure 12.1 Major developmental tasks, and corresponding challenges posed by illness, from
birth to 18 years old</div>

How parents cope with these issues, and the
social support available to them, are two of the
most important determinants of outcomes.
Parents who effectively utilize family support,
those who maintain a positive outlook, and those
who manage to integrate the child's medical
care/daily regimen into their normal routines
perceive less burden (Ray and Ritchie, 1993).


In a Finnish study of parents of children with
a chronic illness (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,
asthma), several forms of social support, including
emotional support, instrumental support, and
support from health care staff were identified
(Hentinen and Kyngas, 1998). Higher levels of
emotional and instrumental support were closely
associated with more positive adaptation.


Researchers have also sought to determine if
there are basic differences in the coping styles of
mothers and fathers. It has been found, for example,
that mothers and fathers rely on different
strategies to support themselves when their
children are affected by chronic illness
(Copeland and Clements, 1993). Fathers may be
more likely than mothers to use 'reasoning'
strategies, whereas mothers may be more likely
than fathers to use 'releasing' and 'relating'
strategies. Reasoning strategies include seeking
information about the illness and teaching the
child about his or her disease. Releasing strategies
include physical and emotional activities that
expend energy (for example, exercising, crying),
and relating strategies include communicating
with others and involvement in support and religious
groups.


<b><i>Patterns in Children's
Illness and Development</i></b>


Of course, the degree of impact further depends on
several other factors, and may be moderated by
both stage of illness and phase of child development.
In terms of the stage of illness, psychological
sequelae usually begin to emerge in parents at
the time of the child's diagnosis, and may ultimately
alter family life for years to come. In terms
of the child's development, hospitalization during
infancy is consistently noted as being one of the
most highly stressful events for parents (Goldberg
et al., 1990; Coffman et al., 1993). Regardless of
age at diagnosis or treatment, health care
providers must work towards helping families
maintain a sense of normalcy. Further, they must
strive to keep the child on the same developmental
trajectory as if the illness was not present. As
such, we now turn our attention to the topic of
development, and the potential issues faced by
parents of ill children at the various phases.

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>INFANCY</b>


From birth to 18 months, infants develop through
two primary avenues: (1) exploration of their
environment, and (2) attachment to their care-giver(s).
Physical illness during this period may
impede either or both of these avenues of exploration,
significantly impacting both the infant
and the parent.


In terms of exploration, being in a hospital
room or connected to medical equipment for
extended periods of time is confining and restricting.
While a short period of restricted movement
is unlikely to be detrimental to the infant's longterm
development, prolonged restriction can slow
the rate at which the infant progresses to the next
developmental phase and a referral to a physical
therapist may be necessary.


Physical confinement due to illness may also
impact the infant's ability to form an attachment
to care-givers, and an insecure attachment may
result from parents' lack of resolution about the
diagnosis (Marvin and Pianta, 1996). This phenomenon
is similar to that of infants who are
physically deformed or delayed in their social
responsiveness, who, by the nature of their disability
(for example, craniofacial anomaly), may
provide less feedback or positive reinforcement
to parents in their care-giver role (Perrin and
Gerrity, 1984).


While parents of children of all ages have an
innate desire to protect their children, parents of
infants may also feel at fault for 'causing' the
infant's difficulties (perhaps through passing on
inherited diseases), or feel incapable of managing
their child's care (Stevens, 1994). Some may
even come to question their competency in general
parenting. For example, many illnesses preclude
parents from continuing a typical feeding
routine - a task that helps most parents develop
confidence in their parent role. It is not surprising,
then, to find that across illness groups much
research has demonstrated greater stress in parents
of infants who are ill as compared to parents
of healthy infants (Goldberg et al., 1990;
Stephenson, 1999).


<b>PRESCHOOL</b>


Similar to infants, toddlers and preschoolers, or
children aged 18 months through 5 years, are
largely dependent on their parents or care-givers.
By 18 months, most children are comfortably
mobile, and movement restrictions due to illness
are, therefore, less likely to cause significant
delays in motor development or disruptions in
attachment at this phase.


Instead, challenges to parenting are more
related to helping children understand their
illness, and helping them to co-operate with
treatment. Because of their use of 'magical
thinking', children may come to believe they are
to blame for the illness or painful medical regimens,
and parents may feel at a loss over how to
explain the need for various procedures to them.


Development of self-control is also important
for toddlers and preschoolers. Yet this can also
be affected by illness when children are precluded
from making choices, or parents are
reluctant to set appropriate limits on behavior.
For example, when children are in hospital, medical
staff frequently enter the child's room to perform
various procedures, often with little
warning or advance notice given. They typically
do not offer any choice over the timing of procedures,
or even preference for physical placement
or location of venipuncture lines (left or right
arm) or devices to monitor vital signs. Similarly,
when preschoolers start feeling better and regain
their strength and activity levels, parents may
allow these children to act out in ways that would
not have been tolerated prior to the child's illness.
No matter what the medical circumstance,
self-control cannot be learned unless children's
negative behaviors are limited and corrected.


<b>SCHOOL AGE</b>


For school-aged children (6-11 years), accomplishing
developmental tasks is largely affected
by interactions with peers, with children at this
age using social comparison to help them judge
their competencies in various domains of life.
Disruption in normal routines due to illness can
limit children's opportunities for social interactions,
or even cause them to look and/or feel different
from peers. This may hamper the personal
growth typically gained from peer interaction.
Irregular school attendance due to illness also
limits children's opportunities to succeed, and
may reduce their likelihood of future achievement
unless corrective steps are taken.


<b>ADOLESCENCE</b>


Perhaps the largest body of literature related to
children's health and their development focuses
on the transition to adolescence (ages 12-18
years). Many challenges occur at this phase,
including identity formation, struggling with
body image issues, and the move towards independence.
These tasks may be particularly challenging
for the adolescent with an illness. For
example, the treatment of various illnesses (such
as cancer) can significantly alter their appearance.
To the teenager, adverse changes in physical
appearance, such as hair loss, can be devastating.
It is not surprising, then, that adolescents with

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For all adolescents, regardless of health status,
formation of an individual identity is a major
task of this developmental phase. It is normal for
adolescents to report a decline in closeness to
their families during this transition, and many
note spending significantly less time with parents
than at previous ages (Larson and Richards,
1991). This path towards independence can lead
many parents to struggle with their new role in
their teenager's lives, and may even adversely
affect parents' own mental health (Silverberg
and Steinberg, 1990).


The task of independence poses particular
challenges for parents of children who are ill.
Just when parents are beginning to relinquish
some responsibilities for the adolescent, an illness
can easily overwhelm and alter this situation,
necessitating parents once again to become
intimately involved in every aspect of the
teenager's life. This causes difficulties for the
adolescent, the parent, and also the parent-adolescent
relationship.


<b>APPLICATION OF THEORY
TO ASSESSMENT</b>


The need to consider the impact of the child's illness
on not only the child, but also on his or her
parents or family members has been a consistent
theme in this chapter. Now we will turn to
putting our knowledge into practice by highlighting
the ways in which practitioners can assess the
need for intervention among these individuals.
Through careful assessment, practitioners can
determine which parents are at risk, and who
might benefit from behavioral counseling.


As noted earlier, impact or stress is multidimensional.
Assessing how families appraise the
specific stressor, or child's illness, is the cornerstone
to understanding the stress faced by diese
parents. Two parents faced by the same adversity,
or with children diagnosed with the same illness at
the same developmental period, are likely to
respond in different ways. One parent, for example,
may not consider himself or herself to be
experiencing excessive stress, while the other may
appraise the situation as stressful, or feel that the
demands of the illness outweigh his or her available
resources. The stress may impact on their
physical or psychological state, intimate relationships,
work, and response to the rest of the family.


Once the degree and point of impact or stress
has been determined, practitioners may focus on
how parents cope with the child's illness. They, as
well as parents, learn that coping is a highly individual
response to a stressor, there being no 'right'
or 'wrong' way of coping, though clearly some
ways are more disruptive than others. Such valueladen
judgments as 'right' and 'wrong' have no
place when working with families, and are counterproductive
to the goal of assisting them.


Similarly, practitioners should not expect how
a parent copes at one point in time during the
child's illness to be the same as how he or she
copes with future difficulties. Coping patterns
most certainly change over time. All too often,
hospital staff form an impression of parents
based upon their initial distress when the child is
diagnosed. However, after the initial shock and
grief over the diagnosis dissipate, many parents
return their energies to the problem-focused
approaches often demanded by the condition of
the child and the imperative of managing it as
well as possible.


The assessment of parental stress may demand
a referral for psychological intervention. The
assessment of coping can be particularly helpful to
health care professionals in such ways as understanding
how much information parents like to be
given, what resources they use to manage upsetting
Thoughts, and how bad news should be given
to them. Developing a greater appreciation and
awareness of individual differences in response to
stressful situations associated with children's illness
is important because practitioners will find it
facilitates their communication with the parent.


Formal clinical assessment of stress and coping
resources in parents is often not appropriate,
unless the condition causes serious concern. In
such cases, choice of measurement would be
based on the particular stressor, for example,
parental anxiety, depression, daily hassles,
parent-child communication or family functioning.
Where possible, we also believe that measures
specifically designed for parents of children
with an illness are particularly useful. By using
pediatric-specific assessment tools, practitioners
may be better able to identify the specific origin
of stress and how individuals cope with particular
medically related difficulties (Rodrigue et al.,
2000; Streisand et al., 2001, in press).


<b>IMPACT ON PARENTAL
FUNCTIONING AND
PARENTING PRACTICES</b>


Earlier in this chapter we reviewed some of
the ways in which illness, development, and

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Physical Limitations</i></b>


Given the limitations in exploring their environment,
children with limited physical motility,
including those in wheelchairs, and those with
hearing and visual impairments, are prone to
many and diverse frustrations and psychosocial
challenges. Parents of these children face difficult
tasks, such as getting their children enrolled
in suitable schools, and helping them adjust to
having a limited number of opportunities for
social interaction. Though the range and availability
of such schools vary across countries and
localities, compared with schooling and social
development of normal children, there are
always difficulties.


Children with visual impairments have an
increased number of behavioral and social skills
problems (Teare, 1984; Ammerman et al., 1989,
1991; Tirosh et al., 1998). Parents of these
children have been found to
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• have a range of difficulties starting from the
birth of the visually impaired child,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• hold unrealistic expectations for the child's
abilities, and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• have a tendency toward over-protection.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Other work suggests that similar issues are faced
by parents of children with hearing impairments.
Such parents report greater life stress and, in particular,
stress related to conflict in their many
parental and personal roles, or concerning
finances and occupation (Meadow-Orlans,
1995).


• have a range of difficulties starting from the
birth of the visually impaired child,


• hold unrealistic expectations for the child's
abilities, and


• have a tendency toward over-protection.


Investigations with hearing-impaired children
have been conducted in several different countries,
all yielding a consistent finding: increased
stress in parents of these children (Horsch et al.,
1997; Lampropoulou and Konstantareas, 1998).
Parent factors have been shown to play a role in
parental adjustment to a child's hearing impairment.
Within a sample of Greek parents of hearing-impaired
children, for example, it was found
that parents who reported lower self-esteem
endorsed higher levels of stress (Konstantareas
and Lampropoulou, 1995).


Parents of children with physical limitations,
such as those with spina bifida or cerebral palsy,
have similarly been found to have a difficult
adjustment period characterized by shock and
disbelief, which often occurs around the time of
the child's birth and subsequent diagnosis.
Compared to parents of healthy children,
research has shown that parents of these children
express elevated symptoms of depression (Miller
et al., 1992), reduced parental satisfaction and
competence, and a greater sense of social isolation
(Holmbeck et al., 1997).


Both illness severity (Havermans and Eiser,
1991) and parental coping characteristics (Miller
et al., 1992) have been associated with parental
stress outcomes. Parents of children with more
severe limitations, and those utilizing more emotional
coping strategies, generally report greater
levels of parenting stress. The impact of the
child's physical disability on the marital relationship
is less clear, with some studies citing
increased marital discord, or citing the child's disability
as the main cause for rupture (Tew et al.,
1974; Havermans and Eiser, 1991). However,
other studies have found no decrease in marital
satisfaction as compared to parents of healthy
children (Holmbeck et al., 1997).


<b><i>Diabetes</i></b>


Parents of children with diabetes must assist their
children in adhering to a complex daily medical
regimen mat consists of multiple insulin injections
and blood glucose tests, careful nutrition
planning, and participating in regular physical
exercise. The goal of properly adhering to the
regimen is for children to attain prolonged periods
of near-normal blood glucose levels.
However, given the complexity of the different
aspects of the regimen, non-adherence often
occurs (Johnson, 1994). It has been suggested
that parents must remain active in their children's
diabetes management from the time of diagnosis
through to adolescence (Anderson et al., 1997).


Research studies have examined several family
and parenting variables related to outcome in
children with diabetes, as well as the impact of
the illness on parents' own functioning. In regard
to children's metabolic control, it has been
shown that parental warmth is associated with
better adherence, and parental restrictions associated
with poorer metabolic control (Davis et al.,
2001). In terms of other child-rearing practices,
parents of children with diabetes generally use
less limit-setting of their children's behavior
than parents of healthy children (levers et al.,
1994). This finding may stem from the fact that

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Family structure and disease impact have also
been explored, with parents of children with diabetes
from single or reconstituted families
reporting poorer family organization and greater
childhood behavior problems than parents of
children from intact two-parent families
(Overstreet et al., 1995). Similarly, children from
single-parent families have been found to have
poorer metabolic control than children from two-parent
families (Thompson et al., 2001), suggesting
that the family structure may directly impact
parents' ability to help children adhere to the
daily regimen.


In terms of impact on the parents themselves,
a number of studies suggest that parenting a child
with diabetes is associated with less parenting
satisfaction and lower efficacy related to parenting
(Rodrigue et al., 1994), as well as elevated
risk for poor mental health outcomes. Specifically,
parents of children with diabetes experience
significant stress, which places them at risk
for anxiety and depression (Johnson, 1994).


Longitudinal investigations are currently
examining how mental health outcomes in parents
change over the course of the child's illness.
Findings so far indicate that parents have an easier
time coping with their child's diabetes management
over time (Kovacs et al., 1990). Overall,
diabetes management clearly impacts the entire
family, and may affect not only parenting practices,
but parent mental health outcomes. Health
care professionals must consider the role of the
family when examining children's adherence
or metabolic control, as the effects on family or
parenting stress and metabolic control are likely
to be bi-directional, with each impacting upon
the other, and both therefore playing an important
role in adjustment (Viner et al., 1996).


<b><i>Asthma</i></b>


Asthma is the most common chronic illness in
childhood. While most affected children are able
to lead a normal life with the use of daily medication,
illness severity varies, and some
children experience repeated hospitalization
and/or extended school absences. The role of
parents in asthma management is focused on
assisting the youngsters with adherence to
medication, which typically involves daily use
of inhalers. The chronic and often unpredictable
nature of the illness is one of the reasons that
parenting a child with asthma can be particularly
challenging. While earlier research focused on
identifying family or parenting practices that
may have contributed to the onset of asthma,
contemporary thinking is that children's asthma
attacks may be triggered by family stress, but
family or parenting difficulties <i>per se</i> do not
cause a child to have asthma (Carson and
Schauer, 1992).


Similar to research within the area of childhood
diabetes, family characteristics and
parenting practices, as well as parent mental
health outcomes, have been explored in childhood
asthma. While some researchers suggest
that parents of children with asthma are more
critical and negative than parents of healthy
children (Schobinger et al., 1993), others have
found no difference between the parenting
practices of healthy children and children with
asthma (Eiser et al., 1991). Parents of these
children have been found to experience significantly
greater stress (Eiser et al., 1991), be at
risk for depression (Hookham, 1985), and have
increased rates of marital discord and divorce
(Faleide et al., 1988) as compared to parents of
healthy children.


<b><i>Cystic Fibrosis</i></b>


Similar to asthma, cystic fibrosis also affects the
lungs, with respiratory difficulties posing the
most significant problem for these children.
Cystic fibrosis is a chronic, terminal illness, and
is the most common terminal genetic disorder
among Caucasian children. Like the previously
mentioned illnesses, cystic fibrosis requires significant
effort on the part of parents and children
to manage the illness. Parents must assist
children in adhering to a daily regimen involving
inhalants, physical therapy on the chest, following
a prescribed nutrition plan, and taking enzyme
medication. Coupled with the everyday demands
of the regimen, parents of children with cystic
fibrosis live with the knowledge that their child's
illness is terminal, and the uncertainty of knowing
when the child will become seriously ill and
threatened.


While parents of children with cystic fibrosis
have been found to use parenting practices rather
similar to those used by parents of healthy
children (involvement, responsiveness, guidance),
studies have found these parents to be less
likely to set limits on their children's behavior

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps more so than in the previously mentioned
illnesses (physical disability, diabetes,
asthma), the stage of the illness in cystic fibrosis
plays a significant role in parental impact. For
example, Quittner et al (1998) highlighted the
importance of understanding the context of the
parental stress, rather than conducting global
assessments of parental functioning. Given the
terminal nature of the disease, with most children
leading relatively normal lives for years until
becoming increasingly ill, it is understandable
that parents' stress and adjustment vary as a
function of the child's health. This may account
for the equivocal findings noted above, and
underscores the importance of considering the
illness itself as one part of the larger system
affecting the child and family.


<b><i>Cancer</i></b>


Within childhood cancer, issues of prognosis, illness
severity, and duration of illness and treatment
vary greatly, with some children remaining
on treatment for over two years at a time. Parents
of children with cancer encounter stressors similar
to parents of children with other illnesses,
such as assisting children with medical procedures,
hospitalizations, and adjusting to school
absences. In addition, given the physical side-effects
of many types of cancer treatment (for
example, chemotherapy and resulting hair loss),
parents usually must help their children adapt to
a changing physical appearance. Unfortunately,
while increasing numbers of children with cancer
are being successfully treated, some parents
of children with cancer will also experience the
terminal phase of their child's illness.


The idea that parenting practices in parents of
children with cancer differ from practices in parents
of healthy children has been widely explored.
For example, Hillman (1997) compared the
practices of parents of children with cancer to
those of parents of healthy children. On diensions
measured, the groups differed significantly
on discipline and over-protectiveness issues.
Specifically, parents of children with cancer
were, not surprisingly, more likely to endorse 'I
tend to spoil my child' and 'I worry about the
health of my child.' While other studies have also
demonstrated increased over-protectiveness in
these parents (Wasserman et al., 1987), others
have found no differences in such parenting practices.
It has been suggested that a lack of healthy
comparison samples or use of non-standardized
assessment measures may be possible reasons
why previous studies have found differences in
parenting practices (Davies et al., 1991).


Regardless of whether changes in parenting
practices occur or not, it is clear that parenting a
child with cancer has a profound impact on the
parents' own functioning. Mothers and fathers
may experience the impact differently (Brown
and Barbarin, 1996; Martinson et al., 1997), and
may parent the child differently - a not unusual
issue, exaggerated by the child's condition. In
terms of the emotional impact on parents, parents
of children with cancer have been found to display
a wide range of symptoms including significant
levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and
even symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder
(Kazak and Meadows, 1989; Speechley and Noh,
1992; Streisand et al., 2001). These symptoms
can affect parents both while their children are
being treated for cancer, and when their children
are considered to be cured or off treatment.


Some investigations suggest that the level of
emotional support that parents have during their
child's illness plays a role in the parents' experience
of anxiety and depression (Speechley and
Noh, 1992). In addition to the emotional impact,
it has been suggested that parents of children
with cancer may also experience significant
physical symptoms, particularly in cultures that
are more accepting of physical rather than
psychological difficulties (Martinson et al.,
1997).


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE</b>


As a child's illness can affect both child and
parents in myriad ways, health care teams should
strive towards promoting greater awareness of
these issues among parents, alerting them to the
potential difficulties in terms of the child's
developmental phase, as well as stage of the illness.
In addition to working towards preventing
such problems from occurring, health care workers
should also assist in the early identification of
those families in greatest need. The fact that our
knowledge is far from complete and has to take

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By addressing children's and parents' difficulties
early, later phases of child and family development
are less likely to be adversely affected,
with an increased likelihood of achieving positive
outcomes. This investment in early intervention
has led to major initiatives in promoting development
among ill children, including home visiting,
in hospital behavioral intervention, and outpatient
management.


<b><i>Home Visits</i></b>


Home visiting programs for families caring for
medically ill children are an important way of
assisting parents to develop their child-rearing
skills. These programs often target high-risk
parents, including those with chronically ill
children. Though programs vary substantially in
their scope, most provide parent education, training,
social support, and co-ordination with other
social service agencies.


The effectiveness of home visiting programs
has been demonstrated in a small number of
studies conducted by the American Academy of
Pediatrics (1998) with expectant couples, families
of newborns, and during early childhood.
An Australian randomized controlled study of
nurse home visits with families of at-risk
infants has demonstrated beneficial effects on
mothers' psychological functioning and parentinfant
bonding (Armstrong et al., 1999). In one
of the earliest studies to include parents in
preparing for their child's medical procedures,
researchers provided home preparation for the
child's tonsillectomy (Wolfer and Visintainer,
1979). Parents who were provided a preparation
book reported better adjustment than those
without such preparation.


<b><i>Intervention for In-Hospital Procedures</i></b>


Interventions conducted within the hospital
setting focusing on parents also show encouraging
results. In a randomized controlled trial conducted
with parents of children undergoing bone
marrow transplantation, Streisand et al. (2000)
administered a multi-part in-hospital training
program that included the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• education about children's behavioral
responses to illness, medication, and medical
procedures;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• strategies for relaxation and positive coping;
and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• strategies for communicating with the child,
other family members, and members of the
health care team.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
While there were no statistically significant
differences between the intervention and control
groups, trends in the data suggest that parents
often used the strategies they learned to help
manage their stress levels.


• education about children's behavioral
responses to illness, medication, and medical
procedures;


• strategies for relaxation and positive coping;
and


• strategies for communicating with the child,
other family members, and members of the
health care team.


Other studies have focused on interventions
with both hospitalized children and their parents.
For example, in an attempt to prepare children
with congenital heart disease for cardiac surgery,
Campbell et al. (1995) randomized child-care-giver
pairs to a treatment or standard care group.
Parents in the treatment group reported greater
confidence in their ability to care for their child
both in the hospital and following discharge.


<b><i>Out-patient Management</i></b>


Many childhood illnesses do not require frequent
hospitalization and are managed at home. In a
stress management program for parents of
children with severe handicaps, researchers
designed a training program for parents consisting
of self-monitoring of stressful events, progressive
muscle relaxation, and modification of
cognitions associated with distress (Singer et al.,
1998). After eight group sessions, parents in the
intervention condition reported significantly
lower levels of anxiety as compared to those in
the no-treatment control group.


Similarly, in an intervention designed to
reduce distress in children undergoing endoscopy,
parents were included in a behavioral intervention
program for children (Young and Schnee,
1997). Parents and their children were divided
into one of three conditions: (1) standard medical
treatment, (2) hypnotherapeutic intervention, or
(3) counseling. While no differences in child or
parent distress were noted between groups, the
authors believed that in order for parents to serve
as role models for their children, they may have
needed more intensive training than was offered
by the intervention.


While the available data on interventions are
somewhat limited, initial findings from studies of
parenting and chronic illness suggest the potential
for improving parent well-being and child
health outcomes. Although there are no specific
interventions for parents in such circumstances
that have been empirically validated, we offer
some general guidelines for practitioners working
with these families. Table 12.2 includes a
number of examples of ways in which practitioners
can support parents in their efforts to parent

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I009&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Throughout this chapter we have attempted to
emphasize the importance of parents' keeping
children on the same developmental track
despite living with a chronic illness. We believe
that in doing so, parents themselves are more
likely to stay on their own track of parenting, and
ultimately preserve their emotional well-being.


<b>AUTHORS' OVERVIEW</b>


This chapter began with an introduction to the
diverse history of research focused on parents of
children with chronic illness. The roots of this work
can be traced to early pioneers in the fields of pediatrics,
child psychiatry, and child psychology, and
the coming together of these specialties to focus on
common issues pertaining to growth and development
among ill children. Further, in the light of an
emerging focus on comprehensive child health
care, psychological and behavioral adjustment and
the well-being of parents fall within this purview.


Several cross-cutting themes in child health,
parenting, and stress and coping have been identified.
These include the concept of 'pediatric
parenting stress' (or the stresses faced by parents
of children with chronic illness), the prevalence
of behavior problems among ill youngsters,
theoretical models of parent, child, and family
adaptation to illness (family systems theory, illness
trajectory and social-ecological model,
disability-stress-coping model), the convergence
of children's illness (diagnosis, acute in-hospital
treatment, out-patient management, follow-up
care) with developmental phases (infancy, toddler,
preschool and school age, adolescence), and
how this can result in children 'getting off track.'


Recognizing the importance of maintaining
children's developmental progression during illness
periods, it is critical that professionals work
closely with parents of children with physical
limitations and conditions such as diabetes,
asthma, cystic fibrosis, and cancer to assess their
strengths and resources, as well as intervene
when necessary and appropriate. We offer
below, the major implications of the relevant
research in terms of do's and don'ts for those
who wish to help parents of ill children.


<b><i>Do</i></b>


• help parents learn about the child's illness,
treatment, and potential impact of it on the
child's behavior;


• assist parents in communicating about the
illness to the child in honest, simple, and
developmentally appropriate terms;


• encourage parents to help their child lead as
normal a life as possible, particularly in
social and activity terms;


• suggest that parents maintain a family
routine, including the use of consistent
discipline;


• promote parents' expression of fears and concerns,
while at the same time helping them to
remain calm and realistic;

<b><i>Don't</i></b>


• assume that parents fully understand how the
child and family will be affected;


• expect parents to know how best to communicate
with their child about the illness;


• recommend that parents restrict children
from social, educational, or occupational
activities as a result of the illness;


• encourage parents to bend the rules for their
child if they feel guilty about the illness;


• tell parents to imagine or prepare for the
worst;


• assume that parents' stress, anxiety, or
depressive symptoms will decrease on their
own.
