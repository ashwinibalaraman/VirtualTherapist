THE SHIMMERING, EVER-SHIFTING<br />
BORDERLINE LIKE ALL BOUNDARIES<br />
BECKONS AND ASKS TO BE CROSSED.


—SUSANNAH KAYSEN, <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>


"Well, I may or may not be bipolar," I say as I walk into Paula's office.
The question of a bipolar II diagnosis had been raised a couple of times
in the preceding months. "But I am definitely borderline."


I don't even realize until this moment that I am<br />
skeptical of everything Paula says.


Or that I find it hard to believe I have an actual disorder. Much
less one that marks me as among the most dreaded of psychoanalytic
patients.

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

BORDERLINE PERSONALITY and BIPOLAR DISORDER may not even
be distinct conditions. The questions preoccupying me—about which
one I really have, or whether I have both or maybe neither—are psychological
defenses. My quest for a term to contain me is not a cure but a
clamp. The words hold my broken parts closed so blood doesn't spill on
the floor.


Books arrive in the interlibrary loan office and I check them out
with zest. How smart the methodical labor of research makes me feel.
My immediate fascination with borderline personality is grandiose and
self-defeating and does nothing to stop the bleeding. I am a sloppy physician.
My sutures barely hold. I leave sponges and scalpels inside. I hold
my bare arm out towards Paula as if it says something irrefutable. As if
the cuts are stigmata that spontaneously appeared on the surface of my
skin to prove borderline dysfunction dwells inside me like a demon. I
want her to draw madness from my body and send it running off a cliff
in the sallow husks of swine.


"Oh my god. What brought that on?"


Paula busies herself with papers on her desk and asks if it's the
worst cutting episode I've ever had.

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes," I say.


My eyes sting from sleep deprivation. I wonder if she can tell I've
been drinking. "I am pitching a tantrum," I say. I want her to tell me
how to stop.


"Are you ready for the hospital?" She is trained to be blunt in confronting
my borderline behavior with reminders of consequences. The
scars, institutions, the stigma of madness on my permanent record.


"No," I say.


Secretly I wonder if I really should be locked up.<br />
If maybe this <i>is</i> crazy. If I'm already there and<br />
just don't know it.


I remember a line from a story about a shipwreck. The moment
despair sets in—after several days and nights of battling cold and hunger
and thirst and circling sharks—one of the men thinks about giving
in and letting himself drown. "Once one is properly wearied," he thinks,
"drowning must really be a comfortable arrangement, a cessation of hostilities
accompanied by a wave of relief." I think of giving in. I picture
nurses and pills and cinderblock walls. I imagine lining up behind the
other crazy girls waiting for food and medication and therapy.


I think of letting myself go under, but I'm not ready.<br />
"Not yet."

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That weekend I go househunting in the new town where I will
start over and make myself brand new. Temperatures rise to 80 degrees.
I wear long sleeves to hide scabbed cuts on my arm. I go to dinner with a
new colleague and when she asks about my life, I am brief and evasive.


I remember that first dinner with Emily when I had just been hired.
The drinks. The secrets. My open mouth / open heart / open wounds.


I broke up with Emily. I am getting over Evan.


I can't afford to open up again.


I drive home the next day. For the next six weeks I blur my eyes
and time passes like poppies viewed from a fast train. I don't want to
feel the ground beneath my feet until I am standing on the other side
of the state. I want to walk out on obsession in the early hours while it
sleeps. I want to get away from my spoiled identity and the people who
watched me fail to thrive. I plan to retrieve my dignity from the waste
bin and start over.


Paula tells me to stop being a fool.


"The same predicament awaits you in this new town," she says.
"You can't escape your psychology by changing your setting," she says.
"You will set up triangles and frustrations and addictions there too.
Guaranteed."


<b>BUT LEAVING IS ALL I KNOW TO DO</b>.

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WILLIAM FAULKNER WROTE a dramatic fictional account of borderline
personality and published it with the title <i>As I Lay Dying</i>. The
novel is a Gothic Southern love note to a dead woman named Addie
Bundren who occupies the empty spaces of emotional refusal. She is
not-mother and not-wife. Bitter complaint and cold fish. From the hard
bed of her coffin, her body pops and sighs in the heat.


A word is <i>just a shape to fill a lack,</i> she says.


Truer words have never been spoken, especially in the academic
fields of borderline etiologies, psychopathologies, neuropsychologies, and
the gendered social histories of madness, illness, and medicine, where
words almost never fit what they are trying to say. Adolph Stern coined
the term BORDERLINE PERSONALITY the same decade Faulkner exhumed
the details of invalidating environments from the not-grave and not-peace
of a woman who believes the purpose of life is to become miserable
enough to welcome death with relief. Addie Bundren knows about
sound and fury and signifying nothing. She says, <i>Sin and love and fear
are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have
for what they never had and cannot have until they forgot the words</i>.

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The same could be said of BORDERLINE PERSONALITY. The syllables
may be little more than sounds people make for emotional distress they
never felt and won't understand until they drop the word in a lake and
walk away.


The psychiatric term BORDERLINE initially described a person
whose behavior unfolds between two psychological poles—in the borderlands
separating the neurotic from the psychotic. It was based on
a very old psychoanalytic paradigm that divided people into treatable
(neurotic) and untreatable (psychotic). The need arose for a name to
identify people who alternate between periods of disabling anxiety and
spirals of angry outbursts, substance abuse, sexual stunts, compulsive
spending, or self-cutting.


Borderlines are people who are NEUROTIC <i>and</i> PSYCHOTIC.


It has also been taken to refer to a person who dwells in the margins
of sane and insane, destabilizing the false binary system that posits
<i>sane</i> and <i>insane</i> as stark opposites easily separated from each other. The
term <i>borderline</i> was assigned to those of us who appear normal but have
a frightening capacity to regress, obsess, or grow vicious.


A woman with straw in her hair.<br />
A fool with a forehead made of stone.

In her memoir of borderline personality disorder, <i>Girl, Interrupted,</i>
Susannah Kaysen calls the condition <i>a way station between neurosis and
psychosis: a fractured but not disassembled psyche</i>. I picture an x-ray of
my psyche, veined with hairline cracks. Kaysen says borderline personality
is more disturbing than people who talk to themselves on trains
or wear hats made of foil to keep government officials from listening
to their thoughts. Less obvious versions of madness blur the lines that
structure our lives.


Without clear lines how can we know CRAZY from NOT-CRAZY?


How do I know when to get help?


<i>How do you know who was good?</i>


Some people believe borderline personality disorder should be
renamed to shift the focus from a spoiled identity to a constellation of
symptoms. Borderline personality wears a red miniskirt and smokes
magic cigarettes with boys who dream of being wild and wake with cold
sweats. She is a WET WILD SEED. Sometimes borderline personality is
medical shorthand for patients who make their doctors uncomfortable.
Unstable, mercurial, self-injurious, contradictory, seductive, clingy, the
term BORDERLINE PERSONALITY has borderline personality. It is in crisis.
It is poised to self-destruct.

<i>If diagnosis is narrative, the words for borderline personality
may be wrong</i>.


Discussion is underway for revisions to the DSM-V scheduled
for release in 2013 and petitions are circulating to replace borderline
personality with "emotion regulation disorder," renouncing the label of
borderline as insult, injury, and outdated bias on par with hysteria. "Is it
by chance," asks one feminist psychoanalytic scholar, "that hysteria (significantly
derived...from the Greek word for 'uterus') was originally
conceived as an exclusively female complaint?"


Madness is a word used to rope a woman's<br />
arms and legs to the bed.


Madness is a metal collar anchoring her to<br />
a cold wall.


The madwoman shrieks and the sound is translated<br />
by some historians as "a response to powerlessness"<br />
in a strange language of protest against a world that<br />
frustrates women by design.

The Mad Pride movement for the acceptance of neurodiversity
featured in <i>Newsweek</i> in May 2009 continues a radical tradition
in psychoanalysis with roots in the work of R. D. Laing, who questioned
the social construction of mental illness: "Setting the sick apart
sustains the fantasy that we are whole." The idea that anyone is mentally
well all of the time is a delusion that gets in the way of asking
for help when we find ourselves falling away from our stable minds.
Marsha Linehan describes this as the borderline patient's first dilemma:


Am I VULNERABLE AND SAD or UNDISCIPLINED AND BAD?


Linehan holds the contradiction in her hand like it's the unsolved
heart of the borderline and asks the patient to look beyond it to more
important questions.


<b>DO YOU DESERVE TO FEEL BETTER?</b>


<i>Do you want to pursue your own human potential for fulfillment?</i>


Speaking to the serious social problems of practitioners refusing
to treat borderline clients and the media representing women with borderline
personality as beautiful sociopaths, in <i>Through the Looking Glass:
Women and Borderline Personality Disorder</i> Dana Becker urges the public
to stop imagining "the borderline client as a 'special case,' unique
and strange, as something or someone that needs to be put at a remove."
Borderline personality can be construed as a lens that amplifies the self-defeating

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Feminist voices are far from alone in the effort to demystify this
disorder. In his roles as director of the International Mood Center at the
University of California at San Diego and editor-in-chief of the <i>Journal
of Affective Disorders</i>, Hagop S. Akiskal points out the unseemly sutures
on the Frankenstein face of BORDERLINE PERSONALITY. As an eclectic mix
of <i>traits, symptoms, and behaviors</i>, the criteria for borderline personality
produce <i>an unwieldy heterogeneity</i> within the category and overlap with
criteria for the affective and addictive disorders. The shared symptoms
are rooted in the domain of impulse control: "BOREDOM, EMPTINESS,
'OBJECT HUNGER,' 'ABANDONMENT DEPRESSION,' MERCURIAL MOODS,
REACTIVE DYSPHORIA, ANGRY OUTBURSTS, AND IMPULSIVE SUICIDALITY."
Joining the efforts of Michael Stone at the Personality Disorders Institute
of Columbia University to relocate borderline personality from the
subschizophrenic to the subaffective scale of disorder, Akiskal playfully
sounds the call for a grassroots feminist psychoanalytic revolution: <i>All
young women unite, you have nothing to lose but your borderline diagnosis</i>.

This is a risky move.


Proposing that the borderline personality label is INACCURATE
or ARTIFICIAL, or that borderlines are NOT CLEARLY DIFFERENT FROM
HEALTHY PEOPLE may further undermine the very real needs for therapeutic
support and corresponding eligibility for medical insurance
claims. These pragmatic concerns cannot be overstated, yet as psychiatric
knowledge steadily evolves, identity categories give way to more
subtle models that conceptualize mental illness <i>as dimensions—continua
or spectra without clear separation from normalcy, and with less
separation from each other than we like to think</i>.

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The whole idea of Axis I and Axis II may prove false and be
replaced with the Five-Factor Model of Personality developed by
Thomas Widiger, a professor of clinical psychology at the University
of Kentucky. Recent discussions of this model were co-authored by
Widiger and his colleagues John Livesley, a professor emeritus at the
University of British Columbia, and Lee Ana Clark at the University of
Iowa, a member of the American Psychological Association committee
on personality disorders, which is currently reviewing and revising the
content of the DSM-V.


The benefits of the change from CATEGORY<br />
to CONTINUUM are vast.


Once questions of CRAZY OR NOT-CRAZY and BORDERLINE OR
NOT-BORDERLINE are removed from the table (along with other neurotic
distractions like Emily or not-Emily and Mother or not-Mother), a more
interesting set of concerns is revealed.


The process of working through grief and<br />
loss can begin.


The facts of attachment disorder, abandonment<br />
depression, and blocked or incomplete mourning<br />
surface to explain what was formerly inexplicable.

The unspoken bereavement of becoming unsistered<br />
that left me clawing the carpet in agony because my<br />
stolen girlfriend would not come when called.


If unhealthy attachment styles, personality disorders, and affective
dysfunction were recognized as PRODUCTS OF A WIDESPREAD SOCIAL DEFICIT
IN EMOTIONAL LITERACY, the headline news that shocks and baffles the
general public would no longer be met with surprise. Why do governors
cheat on their wives? Why do presidents play doctor with interns? Why
does a woman trained to fly to the moon and back let herself be bothered
by a boyfriend who chooses someone else over her? Why would she snap
and make threats? How does she end up shaking like a leaf?


A personality disorder is not the foreign presence of<br />
demonic possession or a cancerous cluster of cells<br />
spreading among the internal organs. It is a pattern<br />
of cognition and reaction that impairs the capacity<br />
to be productive, happy, and generally at ease. It is<br />
a fractured sense of self giving way to the weight of<br />
stressful interpersonal dynamics.


ATTACHMENT DISORDERS ARE AS COMMON AS DIRT.
<i>They should not be relegated to the speechless realm of the ineffable</i>.

A better understanding can and must be built from materials
retrieved from the black holes between words and feelings, past and
present, lover and beloved, mental patient and the people who feel perfectly
fine. Not everyone that agrees borderline personality is a category
beyond repair or a diagnosis preparing to retire.

Specialists who still believe in the term measure and map neuropsychological
phenomena, seeing verbal explosions as microseizures of the
frontal lobe supports arguments for BORDERLINE PERSONALITY as a form
of EPILEPSY. The acoustic startle eyeblink response has been tested to
quantify <i>the neural circuitry of emotion-processing deficits</i> in borderlines,
adding a solid layer of hard science to the leading argument for renaming
borderline personality as a DISORDER OF EMOTION REGULATION—and a
corresponding move of the condition from Axis II to Axis I, where bipolar
disorder, borderline personality's estranged affective twin, resides.


Other theorists manage the heterogeneity of borderline personality
by generating subtypes like siblings to capture the unique faces without
denying their family resemblance.


<i>I am one of three sisters who share the diagnosis in our emotional DNA</i>.
Our borderline personalities are easily matched with the detailed four-part
typology developed by Thedore Millon in his work as director of the Institute
for Advanced Studies in Personology and Psychopathology.


<b>DISCOURAGED BORDERLINE</b> (LISA)


By exclusively relying on a single someone, discouraged borderlines
"put all their eggs in one basket." Always fearing that

<b>SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BORDERLINE</b> (JESSICA)


Self-destruction serves the needs of a comorbid masochistic
pattern. The self-destructive type is unable to find a comfortable
niche with others. Self-destructive borderlines do
not become increasingly testy and bitter over time. Instead,
their masochistic traits cause them to turn inward, where
destructive feelings can be expressed upon the self. These
individuals present a veneer of sociability and conformity.
Underneath, however, are both a desire for independence
and a genuine fear of autonomy. As a result, their social propriety
cloaks a deeply conflictful submission to the expectations
of others. To control these oppositional tendencies,
they struggle to present a facade of self-restraint and self-sacrifice.
Ever deferential and ingratiating, most bend over
backwards to impress their superiors with their conformity,
all the while denying their dependence and becoming
even more conflicted. At times, these antagonisms give
rise to public displays and bitter complaints about being
treated unfairly, to expectations of being disillusioned
and disapproved of by others, and to feelings of no longer
being appreciated for their diligence, submissiveness, and

<b>IMPULSIVE BORDERLINE</b> (MELISSA)


The impulsive borderline is mixed with the histrionic or
antisocial pattern. Unless constantly receiving attention,
such individuals become increasingly seductive, impulsive,
capricious, and irresponsible. Though most borderlines are
infamous for dysregulation of negative emotions, subjects
with histrionic traits become even more behaviorally hyper-active
and cognitively scattered, exhibiting a dysregulation
of positive affects that includes frenetic gaiety, frantic gregariousness,
and irrational and superficial excitement. At

Our three primary types are marbled with fat veins of PETULANCE.
We are STUBBORN. DEMANDING. BITTER. AGITATED. VICIOUS. INDIGNANT.
HOSTILE. Angry at a childhood in which we were mishandled, cheated,
and caught in a power struggle between parents. The petulant borderline
is our gangster alter ego.

SPASMODIC. PARADOXICAL. MERCURIAL. EGO-DYSTONIC.


We become hysterical. We dissociate. We perseverate.


We get too close too fast and wait for the one we love to cheat and
devastate. Or we grow to hate our husbands and wives for hijacking our
lives. Jump from the moving car. Believe we are saving ourselves.


I leave Emily. I leave town. I calm down. I bury my unresolved
neurotic conflicts for another day.

I BROKE UP WITH EMILY and my tact left much to be desired.


I wish I could say I WOKE UP / GOT HELP / SAW GOD / MADE
AMENDS / DID THE RIGHT THING / BECAME A BETTER PERSON / STARTED
A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO SERVING OTHERS.


<b>BORDERLINES WITHOUT BORDERS</b>.


If I were a nonprofit organization the more fitting name would
be BORDERLINES WITHOUT MANNERS. Emily left Vanessa for me but I
no longer wanted her. It was too late. I was too hurt. I dread this part
of the story. I know people will say I only want what I can't have. They
will only be partly right. There is more to my reason for dropping the
obsession with Emily.


There is more to the moment of No that finally arrived inside me.


By the time Emily offered to become not just lovers but partners
and family with me, I had realized we were emotionally incompatible.
Her need for emotional privacy conflicted with my need for emotional
transparency. If I stayed with her I would always burn with anxiety in
my stomach, haunted by the fear that she was wandering with others,
pressing her lips to someone else's, keeping the details of her daily business
from me just to know she could. I had been waiting for the affair to
end, thinking I would be free of anxiety, but something dawned on me
that spring. Being with Emily <i>is</i> being anxious.

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every day would be her birthday trip to Asheville.<br />
The long December weekend when she would not<br />
tell anyone where she planned to stay—not her<br />
partner, not her lover, not her therapist.


She needs a secret compartment in her relationship. That's the only
way she feels solid and whole behind the corporate edifice of lesbian
union. I could not foresee living happily with an opaque window of
a wife, and I no longer wanted to proceed with the sad masquerade
of stolen goods as stable domesticity. The time had come to put right
what I got wrong. When the decision to disentangle myself from Emily
takes up permanent residence in my body—after two years of coming
and going like a tramp—it displaces a lump of anxiety lodged in my
lungs since I was a young girl. If being with Emily <i>is</i> being anxious, the
equation must also indicate that being <i>myself</i> is being anxious. I draw a
breath so deep it surprises me. The stone of folly has been retrieved from
my roughly cracked chest.


This crack in your façade can be the first glimpse<br />
you have had to your real self. Ironically, your newly<br />
experienced vulnerability—the feeling that you are<br />
now exposed for all the world to see, that all your<br />
weaknesses are now visible—is the very thing that<br />
can save you.

Beneath the facades of distraction, debauchery, denial, and diagnosis,
a deeper level of unsolved heartsore questions about mental health
flows. Here is where the hard work truly begins. I set out to make friends
with my borderline personality. I set out to teach my borderline personality
to play well with others.
