TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:
______________________________________________________________________________
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: You said you had thought you had broken your abstinence. But I remember whenever I read your email it didn't seem like I was in 100 per cent agreement.
CLIENT: Well when I wrote that I just knew my addiction chatter was saying that this is ok when I knew it wasn't. I knew that all the energy behind it was addictive. So I think that's what I meant really. 
COUNSELOR: You meant what, what again. 
CLIENT: That the intention in my head when I was drinking my energy drink was just, it was totally addictive energy. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. So what you meant was that it wasn't a break in abstinence but that it was kind of an act that said fed the addiction energy. 
CLIENT: Yeah and it felt totally like a break. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: The feeling was as if I were eating another meal. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. Well I'll go back and read that again. 
CLIENT: You know that I wrote it really fast. I don't know. I don't know what I wrote.
COUNSELOR: Ok. Well I know when Michelle sent her email out to the group where she said, "I overate." and I immediately said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did you mean you really overate or did you mean you ate a high end moderate meal?" 
CLIENT: Uh huh. 
COUNSELOR: I wanted to help her truly state what she meant.
CLIENT: Ok. 
COUNSELOR: I knew we were going to be talking and I was glad because whatever I remembered I didn't think I quite agreed with you.
CLIENT: Ok. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I'm glad that we've got that out of the way; you're still abstinence from the eating addiction but the energy drink fed the addiction energy, right?  So it sounds like for several weeks now you've been feeling surrendered, but the serenity and peace that you had in the first few weeks, the addiction is starting to try to erode. 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. And so this is probably the time to get into the trenches. You really get protective of your abstinence and really get protective of your surrender and protective of your sanity around it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So you want to kinda start there and kinda brainstorm around that? 
CLIENT: Yeah definitely. You know it's dinner as always. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: And it's you know same old, same old.  I've been getting really hungry at 4:30. And I think in some ways I'm eating maybe too little at my breakfast and lunch. And I really think that there's still weight stuff going on behind... wanting to lose weight... Because this morning I was thinking about that and I thought what is behind getting really hungry right now between meals. And what's going on there? 
COUNSELOR: Well you know that's always my first question. If people are having trouble at dinner, I say let's talk about breakfast and lunch because it might mean that there's not enough nutrients coming in.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And that sounds like what you discovered. 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I don't think I've been really planning meals very well at all you know. And so I want to really work on that. I want to plan meals. You know buy enough food for a week with a plan for a week. At least for several days you know. And make sure that I know particularly at dinner exactly what I'm having. And I also want to protect my abstinence by preparing it ahead of time. 
COUNSELOR: So tell me what you mean by preparing ahead of time?
CLIENT: I want to prepare the dinner. Like prepare it in the morning and have it ready to go. 
 
COUNSELOR: And is that going to be, the preparation will be around the time you're having breakfast or will it be absolutely smack dab in between meals? 
CLIENT: No, either before breakfast or around the time that I'm having breakfast. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's usually a little easier on us. If we're already there making breakfast and cleaning up from breakfast to go ahead and either put lunch together or put dinner together that usually works. If it's smack dab in between the meals, it's kinda high risk.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I don't want to do that. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. Alright. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's more what I've been doing. I think I've been making it right before dinner when I'm really hungry. Like rushing in from somewhere and making it and being really hungry. And I didn't do that the first few weeks. I made really. I was very careful. 
COUNSELOR: If you go back and think about the first few weeks of abstinence, when you had the most calmness around your abstinence. Do you remember some of the breakfast meals and some of the lunch meals?
CLIENT: No I don't. And I was looking for my notes on that.
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: Because I know I made notes about that. But I think I actually threw out that notebook. 
COUNSELOR: Ok.
CLIENT: Tonight is a tuna melt and I remember making that a few times because it's one of my favorite things to eat. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. What do you and what do you put with the tuna melt? 
CLIENT: Usually baked tortilla chips and a salad and I was doing half of my energy bar, half an apple with a tablespoon of peanut butter.
COUNSELOR: Ok.
CLIENT: That's what I've planned that for tonight. 
COUNSELOR: Ok and does the family eat that with you? 
CLIENT: Sometimes but most of the time no. 
COUNSELOR: Ok and what do they eat? 
CLIENT: Jesse usually just makes himself something like a hamburger or something with meat. 
COUNSELOR: But you don't have to cook him a separate meal? 
CLIENT: No. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: I don't cook a separate meal.
COUNSELOR: And how about Jenny. What does she do? 
CLIENT: Jenny's not wild about tuna. Today she said she'd eat it. Because I actually put garbanzo beans in it, I kind of make like half tuna half chick pea. 
COUNSELOR: Ok.
CLIENT:  She helped me make it and she said that she would eat it tonight. If she doesn't, then usually my alternative is something that is like a frozen easy meal that I just pop in for her.
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: Because I don't get my hands in it. 
COUNSELOR: Good. So sounds like you've got a pretty good routine going with how you handle her meals and how Jesse handles his own. 
CLIENT: Yeah and one thing that I want to say that I did religiously in those first few weeks and I had forgotten about until right now. I made Jenny's alternative meal list for every meal.
COUNSELOR: You did what now? You made Jenny's what? 
CLIENT: An alternative meal list for Jenny. So that if I knew that I was eating something that was going to be icky for her, I had an alternative meal planned for her
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like one night I made an eggplant, a Chinese eggplant dish and I thought probably she won't eat it so I made sure I knew what her alternative would be so that right when I'm hungry I don't have to go hunting for food for her. 
COUNSELOR: Very good. Very good. 
CLIENT: Yeah, and I have not been doing that. So I need to do that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I did that with my kids when I was in fairly early abstinence. 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: My husband and I had split up and my kids were really mad at me. They took it out on me. And so nothing that I fixed would they eat or even be interested in. And I had to go to having backup meals that were really simple and easy.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: So when they would refuse the meal I cooked, I said, "You know you can go put the bean burrito that's in the freezer in the microwave and you can have that for dinner." Or I'd let them do toaster waffles, because they were older than Jenny. Jenny's very, very little. My kids were five-ish and seven-ish. So rather than me going and fixing a meal, I gave them options and made sure they were in the fridge so that they could go and take care of their own meal. If they didn't want what Mom cooked then they had another option. And that helped me so much. 
CLIENT: Yeah that makes total sense to me. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, good, good. 
CLIENT: It's probably also really helpful to not give her an alternative meal that sounds really wonderful to me. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah so I'm going to work on that too. And I think that's going to really help me.  When I make a plan it really tends to reinforce that I'm taking care of myself. 
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
CLIENT: I really want to look at whether or not I'm doing the weight thing again, and how I'm feeling about my body right now. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Because I think that's in the back of my mind again. You know because something came up. I was with a writer friend who came over to walk yesterday. And she was talking about a book signing that she wanted us to go to. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: And immediately I thought, "Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll go see Christina at her book signing." And then when I came home I was thinking, "You know I've really got to plan that. Because that's a good thing to do for my business and it's a good thing to do to support somebody else." And I have this picture of myself the last time I saw the writer we're planning to go see. And I was a size six. And I remember wearing this red outfit I had bought. And I remember her saying, "Oh my God. You are so little." 
COUNSELOR: And what was that last part she said? 
CLIENT: The other author, the one that we're planning to go see?
COUNSELOR: Yes. 
CLIENT: Said, "You're so little." And I seem to have had, that thought flash through my mind. My next thought was, "I am not going to see that author when I look like this."
COUNSELOR: Oh.
CLIENT: Which right away told me, "Oh you are not very surrendered right now."
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: And I think I've been accidentally dieting these past you know few weeks. Without really saying that to myself, I think that's what I've been doing. And so, when I think about the meals I've had these past few weeks, they've not been as tasty as the meals I made the first three weeks. And not that I think I should only be able to maintain my abstinence with a tasty meal, but it sure does seem to trigger me. You know when I get that voice in my head that's saying, "You'd better have it now or you won't get it." That voice, you know right before I pick on something.
 
COUNSELOR: Right. And so how can you challenge that one? Because I want to help you challenge the body chatter, the dieting chatter as well. So when you hear that kind of anxious impulse, "do it now, do it now" energy you've got to have something to say back to that. 
CLIENT: Well the first thing I need to say is I can eat any food I want at a seated planned meal. And the body God intends for me to have will show up if I'm moderate. 
COUNSELOR: Well there you included both of them... the chatter to challenge the eating addiction and the chatter around the body image as well.  You challenged the chatter around the impulsiveness at the meal, and the body image judgment.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Since you're new in your abstinence, it's good to remember that for most of us the body that God and nature intended us to have doesn't show up too very quickly.
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: Hopefully the weight is moving toward our natural weight by the end of our first year of abstinence... just as the alcoholic's life is starting to come together by the end of their first year so oftentimes is ours. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Right. 
COUNSELOR: And that dieting mentality says to us, you know I've been doing this three weeks, why haven't I lost a ton of weight? 
CLIENT: Yeah, right. 
COUNSELOR: And that's our dieting mentality. And so the more supportive you can be to your body, the better.  When we're ashamed of our body it's like being ashamed of one of our children or being ashamed of one of our parents. You know it's really such a hurtful, hurtful energy.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And so I'm going to encourage you to either do some journaling to talk to your body, do a meditation to talk to your body and to say, "I cannot believe how many times I've done that to you and I know I do not want to do that any more.  I don't want to be ashamed of you or ever embarrassed by you ever again. And I also know that I don't want to be shoving food down your throat or starving you ever again. I do know that I want you to have a chance to be nature's and God's weight."
CLIENT: Ooh that's so beautiful. I've got to write that down. 
COUNSELOR: That's the message. So it's got the amends and it's got the commitment. 
CLIENT: Ok, won't stuff food down you or starve you, you say? 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, ever again. 
CLIENT: What did you say right after that? Do you remember? 
COUNSELOR: I think the first part I said is how sorry the way that I have treated you... as if I'm embarrassed or ashamed of you. And I am committing to not do that again.  So the suggestion is to do a meditation and talk to your body. So doing the amends for the way that you've judged or been ashamed of your body. Never wanting to do that again.
CLIENT: Ok. 
COUNSELOR: And then saying that I'm not going to be shoving food down you nor starving you again. And I'm going to trust that by being the best mom I can be to you that you will get a chance to be nature's weight. And the weight that God and nature would have me be. 
CLIENT: Oh that's great. That's great. That's just great. 
COUNSELOR: I do think it's that kind of compassionate dialog that with our own body that starts to give our body permission to heal.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And by healing, you know I don't mean we're going to become normal eaters, any more than an alcoholic becomes a normal drinker just because they heal from a recovery standpoint. So I just wanted to say that out loud so the addiction couldn't jump in and tell us we'll be normal eaters any minute.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: I also wanted to make sure that if you had any other body stuff or volume stuff going on that we brainstorm a loop to keep you in that rigorous honesty. So if you want to either e-mail me or leave it on my machine.  Probably e-mailing me is the best...making sure of you tell me what you're eating and where you think the meal is in the moderate range. 
CLIENT: Ok. 
COUNSELOR: And you know my suggestion is always to have fours, fives, or sixes in the moderate range for breakfast and lunch. You know at least that... because if you eat low moderate breakfasts and lunches, it's going to make dinner kind of hard. You'll be too hungry and the addiction will encourage the impulsiveness.
CLIENT: Ok.
COUNSELOR: But if you're hungry at 4:30, my guess is if it's real hunger and we don't always know for sure. But it's probably because breakfast and lunch are a little light.
CLIENT: Ok. So, the other thing is I tend to exercise sometimes right around 3:30 or so.
COUNSELOR: What time?
CLIENT: Around 3:30 is when I take an hour walk. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: It's probably also why I'm hungry. 
COUNSELOR: Well you have said in the past that you don't do real good with liquids, like energy drinks, in between meals, right?
CLIENT: Well I if I make a smoothie... I think you had mentioned a smoothie once with almond butter in it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: That's just really dicey for me. But I can always make my own, and I haven't been keeping the ingredients for that. But I have a green drink that I make. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: And I'm totally fine with that. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: Or even milk is fine. 
COUNSELOR: Ok, all right. Then I would suggest on the walks that when you come back you sit down and relax and have your nice enjoyable drink, whatever it is with nutrients. And I'm going to guess dinner's going to be a little better. But again check out breakfast and lunch just to make sure they're in the midrange of moderate... where you feel they should be. 
CLIENT: Ok. 
COUNSELOR: And again, you know moderate meals will give us a moderate body unless there's some other health condition going on. 
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: But it won't give us a moderate body in three weeks. 
CLIENT: Right. (chuckles)
COUNSELOR: No matter how much we want it to be. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I definitely think that's been that going on. The whole, "Ooh and when I move back to Highlands I want to be what I weighed when I left Highlands." That whole thing. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And when are you moving back to Highlands again? 
CLIENT: Sometime in April, probably late April 
COUNSELOR: Ok. And is Jenny going to be changing schools. I know we had talked about Jenny's school last time we talked. Is, April when she's going to have to switch schools?
CLIENT: Um hmm. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: Yeah and I've been toying with the idea of staying here through June. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: So I still will need child care but at least in June Jesse will be through with the heavy rehearsals and then he'll be able to do some of the childcare. 
COUNSELOR: Ok.
CLIENT: So I'm toying with that idea. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. Well again, the people in Highlands have known you a long time. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: They've seen your weight at a variety of stages. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: I don't imagine the people that are close in your inner circle of your life have any judgment about it at all.
CLIENT: Oh they couldn't care less.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I think just telling your inner family those kinds of truths so that they're not hearing you're ashamed of them. 
CLIENT: Right, ok. Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: You know my granddaughter is mentally retarded, and when she was a little kid she looked very, very average. And other little kids would come up to talk to her but she didn't speak. She didn't talk until way, way late. And I don't know how much she understood, but she didn't talk. And so when she wouldn't respond, they wouldn't stay and play with her because she didn't talk. 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: But what I noticed as she got older and, which is true of a lot of handicapped kids they get kind of goofy expressions because they don't have that social pressure to smile right or pose right, you know?
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: And I noticed how both my daughter and son in law have had to adjust to their embarrassment. 
CLIENT: Aww.
COUNSELOR: The staring that goes on. And you know her younger brothers will have to go through their thing. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And it's kind of human nature to have some of that. But we don't, have to settle for the embarrassment... we can change our beliefs and ideas.
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: So even though it may have some human nature to it you want to keep making sure that you're really giving the message that of non-ashamed of your body. And that you're giving our body messages like "Wow, I've really put you through a lot? You have stood by me, Thank you. "
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So that we're very deliberate about it. 
CLIENT: I wonder if I can turn that into a topic inventory, and explore that. Because when you're talking about that, I remembered from the time I was about five years old, I remember people, adults actually even more than kids, at first commenting on my body to my parents or in front of me. 
COUNSELOR: Wow...
CLIENT: And then of course by the time I was you know seven, eight other kids were talking to me about it and I then I heard it in junior high, and high school and college. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I mean that's a lot of messages to me that were given to me growing up... 
COUNSELOR: That's a lot of messages, absolutely.
CLIENT: In my twenties being an actress, that didn't help.
COUNSELOR: No, no. God knows when you go into audition they not only have a right, they have an obligation to comment. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Absolutely.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Yuk, yuk, yuk. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: So, yeah maybe even some amends for putting your body in an industry full of looks judgment.  Tell your body that you wish you'd have said, "You know these people have to judge to pick someone for the part. You know I'm not ashamed of you." You know this message to self is probably how actors and actresses in the best of circumstances could get through that. 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
COUNSELOR: But if we take in that already built in shame that's got to be devastating to your inner world. 
CLIENT: Yeah, absolutely because I did carry all that in. So I just go so caught up in the.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was telling myself I should be getting thinner to please everybody.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. I've had clients that are in the industry, and I've had this one gal call me after auditions and say, "Ok tell me that stuff again. Tell me that stuff again about how I'm perfect and that if this job is for me; it's already mine... that if this part is for me it's all God's business." 
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
COUNSELOR: I can't even imagine having to go through that all the time. 
CLIENT: It's pretty brutal. I remember this gorgeous, gorgeous friend of Jesse's from an acting class he took. And I mean she was like Natalie Woods.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: And she was constantly called in for soap operas and they just couldn't get past the fact that her hips were a little wider than should be on her body. 
COUNSELOR: Aww. 
CLIENT: And I remember she married this very, very average looking, very plain looking guy. He was kind of chubby and he was balding and you know. People said, "Oh my God she could have gotten anyone." 
COUNSELOR: Oh gosh.
CLIENT: I was glad that she got this really great guy who loved her you know. And she loved him. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: And the next time I saw her was at our wedding. And she had gained quite a bit of weight.  She didn't seem embarrassed or anything. I know she eventually lost the weight. I just remember thinking you know she's so absolutely beautiful and I wonder if this person who was enjoying food was struggling to get out all these years.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: You know because she was made to feel so ashamed. And she was gorgeous. There's not a reason why she couldn't have been cast.
COUNSELOR: Yeah I know that whatever that is, if we take in our stuff it can be devastating for us. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And so you know now is the time to make those amends to yourself. When you hear, just like you heard that, "I don't want to go. I don't want to her to see me how I look today." When you hear that voice, you say to all the younger inner family kids, "You know what? That's not our truth. I don't have time right this minute. But before I go to bed tonight we're going to have a sit down talk. And trust Mom that that is not our truth."
 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: And then you go into the meditation with your inner family and really make sure they hear your truth. 
CLIENT: Yeah I have really got to get this. Really you know, really begin to believe all the good things I'm going to say to my body. Because of me but also for Jenny. Because she's, young right now and because she's built like a little truck, people will be communicating stuff to her too. And I have to say something else besides "built like a little truck."
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: But she just started gymnastics. And she loves it. And she's excellent. And the teacher was just shocked by her.  I wasn't because from the time she was a year and a half I thought I've got tot get this kid into gymnastics. She's like a little mountain goat.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: The way she climbs on things. Her balance is amazing. And she's really strong. And they've already put her on the vault and the trampoline.
COUNSELOR: Wow.
CLIENT: And she was turning herself upside down and they stuck her on the little balance beam and then said no let's mover her to the big balance beam. And right away I saw it. Oh my God. If she really gets into gymnastics I wonder if they're, going to say things like "Jen you know you've got to lose that weight to be able to really run, really move on those uneven parallel bars." It just it, I realize I'm going to have to be able to counter balance any input like that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: Really support her in that. Yeah you can run really hard and you can jump and you can run and you can bounce and you can be whatever weight you are with a healthy diet. You know, I mean with loving your body. 
COUNSELOR: Right. 
CLIENT: Right now I mean she just loving her body. She always talks about how long she is and how great her legs work and you know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: The other day I said, "Oh Jenny are you beautiful inside and out?" And she said, "Uh huh. Inside and out." 
COUNSELOR: Aww.
CLIENT: And I thought, "All right."
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: But I know how that can change. 
COUNSELOR: Oh yeah that can change. It definitely can... I've had some clients that were gymnast growing up.
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: And having, being told when they get older and compete, "You have to lose weight. You have to lose weight."
CLIENT: Uh huh.
COUNSELOR: "You're too heavy." And so to make sure that when, when and if that gets said to them that you can say to her, "We probably need to go and talk to that lady because she really does not understand, does she?" Or you go talk to that man, and take her with you when you go and say, "If that's the communication here, I'm not sure we belong here. You know we probably belong with a different teacher because that is not the way the world works"
CLIENT: That's a great way to put it. And I'm so glad that I found the gym she's in right now because not one of these girls, they're all in their twenties, not one of them is skinny. I wouldn't even call them lean. They're just very, very strong. And they said that this is absolutely not for competition. They don't do that.
COUNSELOR: Perfect.
CLIENT: And as long as she's there.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: There won't be any competition. It's all about building self esteem through fitness. 
COUNSELOR: Very, very nice. 
CLIENT: Yeah I'm thrilled with it. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah... 
CLIENT: I'm happy that she could stay there until she's 14.
COUNSELOR: Um hmm.
CLIENT: So.
COUNSELOR: So yeah, you need to probably come up with a phrase other than built like, what did you call her? A truck? (chuckles)
CLIENT: (chuckles) Yeah. That's the first time that I said that. I'm not going to use that one again, no. 
COUNSELOR: I was really a stick kid body in a family where people were short. And you know my mom and dad had divorced when I was really little, and so my step dad was kind of short. My mom was kind of short. But my bio dad's side of the family was really tall and lanky and stuff. But I wasn't around them. 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: And I really got that kind of Ichabod Crane feeling about my body? Is that the right character? 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. So I felt like my neck's too long, my arms are too long. You know I had one friend that teased me about having gorilla arms.
CLIENT: Oh really. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You know as a kid that just kind of distorts your view of yourself. 
CLIENT: Oh definitely, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And you know I grew up in an Italian and Jewish neighborhood.  Where everybody was mostly short and dark. 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: You know, all my friends were just cute as could be. And here I was this freckled face lanky kid and it really felt very like I was like I was on the wrong planet, you know. 
CLIENT: Hmm.
COUNSELOR: And so you know Jenny has the potential for because she's from Belize.
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: Of feeling like she's on the wrong planet for a while. Until, until we get to be adults and then we really move out into the world and we see a variety of sizes and shapes and colors and whatever.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR:. But when you're real little you're often stuck with the neighborhood that your parents are raising you in, you know?
CLIENT: I worried about that with the, yeah with the local school and everything. Just, it was two days ago we met a woman in the park who lives right around the corner from us but she's a doctor so she's never home and her daughter isn't home that much. She's in day care. Four and a half years, the doctor's from Belize. 
COUNSELOR: Oh, perfect.
CLIENT: Um hmm. And the girls got along like wildfire. I mean they were just fantastic together. So I'm really excited about making sure that she's around other kids who are adopted from Belize. And I've connected with a local group. But you know it's still not the same as being around that all the time at school and getting a good mix. This is a very Caucasian neighborhood. 
COUNSELOR: Now if you move back to Highland will you have those same connections? 
CLIENT: No. It's, it's actually more like down there. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: Because up here there's a really thriving group of parents who have adopted. And down there there are that many parents who have adopted but they mostly have adopted Asian kids. 
COUNSELOR: Ok. 
CLIENT: So you know there's some, what she grew, the first two years she was in a different situation where her playmates were other little girls about the same age from Viet Nam. So that was cool.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I don't know what happened with them exactly, so. I mean but I'll try and get in touch with them before we go down. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. 
CLIENT: Because she's getting to the age now where she's actually noticing some color. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. 
CLIENT: Where she didn't before, not at all. But now she does. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Well, you know the best we can do is give them the right messages, you know?
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: They're going to get them other places you know erroneous messages elsewhere but as long as we keep it, I think, lighthearted and say, "No kidding. Somebody thinks that? Wow how silly is that?" 
CLIENT: Um hmm.
COUNSELOR: The at least we're giving them the message of love and acceptance of others... that's what counts
