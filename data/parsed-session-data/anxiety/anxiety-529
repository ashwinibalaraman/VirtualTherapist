BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	I have your disability form.
<b>PT:</b>	You do, okay, good.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, we should talk about it.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The two Xs, I'll give you something [INAUDIBLE].  Okay, the disability form's in front of me.  Should we do that before he gets here or with him?
<b>PT:</b>	I think with him.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So let's start doing our work then.  All right.  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  How are you doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Not good again.
<b>DR:</b>	Not good again, okay.  I saw you on, uh, [DATE] your mood was okay, you were not crying, sad, or anxious.  It was all manageable.  You were getting along with your husband.  Your appetite was good.  You were exercising.  Sleep was okay.  Your energy was good.  Your self esteem was okay.  You're getting, uh, getting one day of lots of agitation, raciness, instability, crying, and anxiety every week or two.  Zyprexa 50 was putting you to sleep.  You were waking depressed for a day and then okay.  And your attention deficit or attention problems were not in good shape either.  Uh, what has happened since?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, last week I had, um, I had more days now.  I had a couple of days.  It was like two full days of depression.  I couldn't get out of bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Come in.
<b>CG:</b>	Hey, doc.
<b>DR:</b>	Hey.
<b>PT:</b>	I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't do anything.  And then I felt better.
<b>DR:</b>	This was this past week?
<b>PT:</b>	Right, last week, this past week.
<b>DR:</b>	Hold on, let's inch our way up from [DATE].  So [DATE] just to review you were, it was once every couple of weeks you had a bad day.  Kind of the breaking through of the demons.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And then within a day or so, a day or two, you can push them down and be back to normal.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	What has changed over these four or five weeks?
<b>PT:</b>	The depression is lasting longer.
<b>DR:</b>	It lasts longer?
<b>PT:</b>	Longer.  And it's more severe.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you agree?
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, she had one like three days I remember, and she was flipping out.
<b>PT:</b>	And then and since coming back and feeling normal, I felt extremely irritable.  A terrible irritable, irritable feeling.
<b>DR:</b>	How long does that last?
<b>PT:</b>	It's been lasting, it's coming and going.
<b>DR:</b>	So your mood is less stable?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  It's the whole week my mood is less stable.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your focus and concentration?
<b>PT:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE] awful.  You have no idea how awful.  I cannot remember things.  I spent half my day looking for things.  I misplaced a necklace, I can't find it.
<b>DR:</b>	Is that attention deficit type stuff?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't—
<b>DR:</b>	It's hard to focus on attention deficit when you're in this state.  But when you're in a more normal mood, can you focus or the focus problem?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] right, it's much worse.
<b>DR:</b>	So when you're in a decent mood, when your mood is back to okay, you can read, you can not be so easily distracted?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Or even then you're impaired?
<b>PT:</b>	Slightly, but it's when the mood is really bad.
<b>DR:</b>	It's more mood related.  It sounds like it's anxiety.  Anxious people just can't think.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe that's what it is.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you anxious when you're in that state, are you very anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've been very anxious.  I've been, I've been taking [INAUDIBLE] 'cause I don't know what I would do without it.  My anxiety has been terrible.  My mood is just awful.  And just everything is like putting me over the edge.  The littlest things are just putting me and I can't cope.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, but still.  You're still much better than you were.  We're going to get you back.
<b>PT:</b>	And the other thing—
<b>DR:</b>	Don't have to be so, you're going to be all right.
<b>PT:</b>	The other thing that's got me really frantic, I cannot take this weight.  I can't stand it.  I really can't.  I can't stand looking like this.  I can't—
<b>DR:</b>	You can't do everything at once.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't stand it.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] come on, work with me here.  Yeah, but you—
<b>PT:</b>	I've been working with you.  I haven't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I know, but that's not allowed to be front and center.  Front and center until we get you well for a long time must be the mood stability.
<b>PT:</b>	I understand that.  But there's got to be something maybe along with it that we can do.
<b>DR:</b>	But it's a priority, but it can't be number one priority.  Are we agreed?
<b>PT:</b>	I understand that.
<b>DR:</b>	We're agreed.  We're agreed.  Your mood disorder is so bad that it's got to be number one on the list.  I hear you that focus and concentration is on the list, weight gain is on the list, sexual function is on the list, all of those things are on the list, but number one must be stabilizing your mood.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Do I have a choice?
<b>DR:</b>	No, you don't.  I'm telling you this, I'm not asking you this.  Okay?  But I promise we'll get to all of them.
<b>PT:</b>	But I feel like the weight is really affecting my health.  My back is out again.  My knees are killing me.
<b>DR:</b>	You've made your case that weight's important.
<b>PT:</b>	All you have to do is look at me and I don't even have to say anything.
<b>DR:</b>	You've made your case.  Well, no, but the point is not how much you weigh, it's how you feel about it.  So you have to make a case, which you did.  You made your case.  It's important, okay?  I want to hear about it again.  We'll talk about it towards the end, but now let me just collect the data.  Can't focus.  You're sad all the time.  You're not stable.  You're anxious all the time.  Appetite is fine?
<b>PT:</b>	My appetite is really, it's not, it's been more.  This past week my appetite has been more.  I believe that's a typical type of depression type of thing.
<b>DR:</b>	What's your energy level like?
<b>PT:</b>	Way down.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] all day every day?
<b>CG:</b>	We go to sleep four or five in the morning, no.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't, I so want to go to bed, I can't fall asleep.  I lay in bed and I want to take another Xanax.  It's like I'm jumping out of my skin because I cannot sleep.  And then I fall asleep and then I can't get up, I'm so tired.  I could sleep all day and be up all night.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], reverse, sleep wake reversal.
<b>PT:</b>	Bipolar patients have that, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, what's your self esteem like?
<b>PT:</b>	It stinks.
<b>DR:</b>	Feel suicidal?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.  I feel really, really bad.
<b>DR:</b>	You have a plan?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't have a plan.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel hopeless?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't think I'm ever going to get better.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel helpless and overwhelmed?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you able to get any pleasure from anything?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, it's been very hard this week.
<b>DR:</b>	Read?
<b>PT:</b>	Like I said, reading last night, but I have been reading.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you stick with it or are you distracted?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I stick with it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, what do you enjoy?  What does she seem to enjoy?
<b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  We sit down and watch a movie I think she likes it.  Do you ever do that?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes, but I've been, I haven't had that much patience for watching a movie lately.
<b>CG:</b>	And reading?
<b>PT:</b>	A little more.
<b>DR:</b>	You're unfocused, you're agitated.  Are you moving a lot?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, last night in bed I was.  Other than that, I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b>	In the beginning of the night, how long does it take to fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't fall asleep until I take Xanax.  I try, I can't.  I have to take the Xanax.
<b>DR:</b>	How much do you take?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, 1 mg.  I try and take a half but then I always wind up having to take the other half.
<b>DR:</b>	Why did you settle on Xanax rather than any of the others like Klonopin?
<b>PT:</b>	It didn't agree with me, Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b>	I think some of the disarray really is that Xanax is so short acting.  That if you need antianxiety all the time, you're letting the Xanax effect run out and then you needed to chase it with more Xanax and you're really bouncing all over the place.  Unless you take Xanax religiously every six hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I could do that if you tell me to.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you need it, do it that way or we could switch you to Ativan which would be every eight hours or Klonopin which would be every 12 hours.
<b>PT:</b>	I'd rather take the Xanax every six hours.
<b>DR:</b>	You would?  Well, we can switch you to a long acting Xanax.  Do you want that?
<b>PT:</b>	How is that?  I mean I've heard good things and bad things about it.
<b>DR:</b>	It's variable.  Some people like it, others don't.  But I mean, what I want to do is not chase the anxiety, but prevent the anxiety.  It sounds like the switch is stuck on anxiety for you, so we just need to turn that volume down.  So if you're going to be on Xanax it's got to be a regular, every six hour dose.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  We'll try that.
<b>DR:</b>	But nothing in between.  I don't want in between doses.  If you need in between, then you didn't take enough at the beginning of the six hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You want to raise that.  So let's get you on something.  And obviously you're not allowed to use it to euphoria.  You can't get high with it.  No increasing doses, right?  We don't want to get you addicted to it.  But we need to cover your anxiety much better than we are.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And of course with your energy so low, Xanax not going to help.  Sounds like you need it, right?  Okay, now you've been worse since the Abilify haven't you been?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm going to guess that's true.  I don't think the Abilify is doing anything for me.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're off the Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I just have it here and there, the anxiety was so bad that I had to take the Zyprexa.  Not on a regular basis but like for four days in a row I had to take it.  When that irritability was so bad, nothing helped but the Zyprexa.  I don't think the Ativan is doing much, I mean, the—
<b>DR:</b>	The Abilify.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean, maybe I'm even worse.  I mean, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not really Abilify.  It's being off Zyprexa [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	You said you felt very good on Abilify, that you're glad you don't need the Zyprexa.  At some point you said that.
<b>DR:</b>	In the beginning, wishful thinking.
<b>PT:</b>	In the beginning, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	One thing [INAUDIBLE] but over the last 20 years whenever she takes a medicine you see that initial extremely helpful effect and then it just wears down to nothing.
<b>DR:</b>	That's more like placebo response.
<b>CG:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Or bipolar.
<b>CG:</b>	The dose would work great and then it would peter out.
<b>DR:</b>	That's not quite what happened here.  Here we had a stable decent mood for a while.  Didn't we?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It was real improvement.
<b>PT:</b>	Tremendous.  And you know what?  That's why it feels so much worse to me now.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	That's the first time in so many years I knew what it felt like to be normal and to be able to be the kind of mother I want to be, the type of wife I want to be, and then—
<b>DR:</b>	We'll get them back.  Don't—
<b>PT:</b>	That's why it feels worse now.
<b>DR:</b>	I promise you we'll get it back.  It slipped away.  It sometimes slips away, but the fact that you could get it means that we can get it back.  We just have to do it without you gaining a ton.  And that's the reason we switched you off the Zyprexa.  If it were only the clinical situation we'd go right back to Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, let's keep talking.  Um, what else is going on?  What do you do most days?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I mean, when I was feeling good, I was, um, you know, seeing friends, um, I even started cooking again, um.
<b>DR:</b>	Now you had these mini episodes of depression, but then [INAUDIBLE], right?
<b>PT:</b>	I was, but this time it's just seems like—
<b>DR:</b>	No, I'm saying you have a bad moment, but most, over the sweep of these four or five weeks—
<b>PT:</b>	Four or five weeks, oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Since I saw you last.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How many episodes have you had?  One every week, one every two weeks?
<b>PT:</b>	One every two weeks.  There's one every two weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	So you had two episodes, but they were a little worse than before?
<b>CG:</b>	And lasted longer.
<b>PT:</b>	And lasted longer.
<b>DR:</b>	And lasted longer.
<b>PT:</b>	Especially this last one last week.  This last week has been steady unstable mood, but before that I went back.
<b>DR:</b>	When you fall into the depression is it preceded by revving up a little bit or being over agitated?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	So you rev and crash.  And then you rev and crash.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, even though it always feels like it's all depression, I think it's stability.  I think we have to get you more stable.  Antidepressants should work.  And they're mostly working except for these breakthroughs.  We just can't allow the instability to break through, so.
<b>PT:</b>	Would increasing the Lamictal help at all?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, we did.  We went up to 500 last time.
<b>PT:</b>	Four hundred.
<b>DR:</b>	No, 500.  You'd gone up to 400 in December.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't know I was supposed to go up to 500.  I've been taking 400.
<b>DR:</b>	Take two of the 200s.
<b>PT:</b>	I had the 100s left, I was taking four of the 100s.
<b>DR:</b>	What were you taking before that?
<b>PT:</b>	Two hundred.
<b>DR:</b>	I have that you were on 400 before that.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	So you were on 200?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you sure?
<b>PT:</b>	One hundred percent.
<b>DR:</b>	You're on 200 from December.  I have different doses here.  I've got you were on, the last time you were on 200 was October.  Then I put you to 300 in November.  In December 400, and last month to 500.
<b>CG:</b>	She didn't do it.
<b>PT:</b>	You could be right.  Maybe I don't remember.  No, maybe I was doing it that way, but I know that I stopped at 400.  Maybe I forgot I was supposed to go to 500.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  But Lamictal if you change it, but at some point your dose changed.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Dramatically.  When did that happen?  'Cause I frequently see that as a cause of—
<b>PT:</b>	It was the last time I saw you.
<b>DR:</b>	But hold on.  You were supposed to be, when I saw you last, when I saw you in December we increased it to 400.  Did you go to 400 for Christmas and January?
<b>PT:</b>	I believe so, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	You're on 400.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	It's four of the ones or two of the twos.
<b>PT:</b>	Four of the ones.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And then when I saw you in February where you see the 500, how did you then wind up back on 400?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess I—
<b>DR:</b>	You just didn't increase it.  So for those other increases you did make.  You're definitely on 400.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So you weren't on 200 in December.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  And the Abilify you went to 5.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what you started me with, and we never went any—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  And the Zyprexa you've been on as needed.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  A day here and there.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And it works when you take it.
<b>PT:</b>	Most of the time, yes, it works.
<b>DR:</b>	What can jumpstart you out of that depression?
<b>PT:</b>	I just need to like come out of it by, nothing seems to really make me come out of it.  I mean, sometimes the Zyprexa will help me to come out of it, and sometimes it doesn't.  Or sometimes I'll have to take more than one, you know, the 0.25, the halves, I'll have to take 5 mg to get it to friz out.
<b>DR:</b>	And will that bounce you out?  Will the next day you be back to normal?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I would say so.  This past week has just been, this past week has really been very bad.  The rest of the time, I was mad [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	Bad day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, this last week has been awful.
<b>DR:</b>	One week doesn't count much.  I mean, it's bad for you, but in the sweep of your mood disorder it's only a blip.  It's not that important.  What's important is that we get you on something that can stabilize you a little more.  And sometimes we just use a lot of low doses of mood stabilizers rather than the increasing one thing to a high dose that can give side effects.  You lost weight on the Abilify as opposed to Zyprexa, it hasn't changed anything?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	But nowhere, oh no, it's changed, I was continually gaining with the Zyprexa.  But I haven't been able to lose.  You know, I gained, I gain a few pounds, I lose a few pounds.
<b>DR:</b>	You ever tried Meridia?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You know what Meridia is?
<b>PT:</b>	It's—
<b>DR:</b>	The appetite suppressant.  But you don't eat much.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't eat much, but when I get very depressed I will eat more.  But I don't eat much.  But I am hungry.  I could use that, but—
<b>DR:</b>	When you're on a stimulant, and you've been on stimulants before, right, Ritalin, Dexedrine.
<b>PT:</b>	I was on Phentamine.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, that's, I was going to ask you about that, but I know you said because of my heart rate that I couldn't take it.  But if my heart rate's still high could I take it with a beta blocker?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you got to get the cardiologist involved.  I would give you that, you know, to suppress your appetite, but.  And your heart rate may not be so high anymore, have you checked?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I still don't know how to take my pulse.  I can't get it.  It's like—
<b>DR:</b>	Did you try in your neck or even on your temple?  Feel all over, in your groin.  You can't find your pulse.
<b>PT:</b>	I thought you said it was hard to get my pulse even.  Last week you said it's hard to get my pulse which I didn't ask you why, I just took it for what it was.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Um, well, I think that the thing that would get you the better the quickest would be going back to a daily Zyprexa dose.  But I think we don't really want to do that.  And let's agree that if you're a real wreck, we would do that.  You're not a real wreck.  For you, you know, I mean, you're letting this demoralize you and make you think, you know, all or nothing catastrophizing that this is the end of the world.  For your mood disorder this isn't horrible, have a few days and then dig out of it.  Right?
<b>PT:</b>	I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	She has to step back and see the forest a little more from the trees.  A few miserable days, okay, then you're out of it.  I think you should use the Zyprexa quicker than what you're using it now.  I mean, if you're down in one of these, boom, use a big dose, get yourself out of it as needed.  Use the 5 mg routinely, get yourself out of it.
<b>PT:</b>	Even for the depression, not just the anxiety?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	The depression too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, all of it.  All of it.  Your brain is thirsty for Zyprexa.  It really wants to see Zyprexa.  And then when you're not, don't use it.  I think we should increase the Abilify, see if we can get more from it and continue to increase the Lamictal.  You know, I wonder if we should add another mood stabilizer.  And, you know, we pulled back recently on the Wellbutrin from 450 to 300.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you've done worse since we did that.
<b>PT:</b>	I never know what the reason is, but it's true I've gotten worse.  I mean.
<b>DR:</b>	To be honest, that and the Vivactil, Vivactil's at a very low dose.  So, you know, and I'm also trying to get you off Vivactil too, which causes weight gain.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, until you give me a few months of rock solid good mood I can't pull things away.
<b>PT:</b>	I understand.
<b>DR:</b>	So eventually we'll go aggressively after your weight gain, but for now we're kind of stuck.  I mean, you're on relatively, for someone as depressed as you are, you're on really low level antidepressants.  You're not on a lot.  You know, you're on 10 of Vivactil and 300 of Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	That's not much.  I vote increasing Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b>	Back to 450.
<b>DR:</b>	Back to 450.  Increasing Lamictal up to 5, and increasing Abilify.  And then putting you on a regular round of Xanax dose.  But the Xanax dose you can reduce as you start feeling better, which you will reduce it.  And then be very quick to use that Zyprexa.  If things go the wrong way.
<b>PT:</b>	As soon as a I start to feel it.
<b>DR:</b>	Immediately.  Your brain just wants to see it, it's thirsty, thirsty for Zyprexa.  Okay?  Um, all right.  Let me write that out.
<b>PT:</b>	Could I take Meridia with all this?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, but not yet.  Give me some stability.  Give me some stability.  Meridia is a pretty strong medicine.  And in preparation for going on it, talk to your cardiologist.  And get, you know, what we really want to see is kind of a, you know, as we get you off the Vivactil you won't have the high heart rate anymore.  But get on a steady beta blocker, you know, just one pill every morning, calm the heart down, and let it, set the groundwork for the Meridia.  And then when I see you, if your heart rate's nice and low, then I can put you on it.  Let me check your heart rate now.  You're up there.  All right, number one, um, I'll just write it here, cardiologist.
<b>PT:</b>	If he can get my heart rate down, maybe even Phentamine which would be better than Meridia, right?
<b>DR:</b>	No, no, no, Meridia is [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Really?
<b>DR:</b>	Phentamine's better.  Phentamine's cheap and easy to use.  Meridia is expensive.  Getting it now, it's more of a hassle.
<b>PT:</b>	It's also a stimulant?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, both of them.  Both of them.  Number two, Abilify 10 mg, Lamictal, now you know how to go up on Lamictal right?  You just break them in half.  [INAUDIBLE] 50s, do 450 for a week and then 500.  So Lamictal 500, um, Wellbutrin 450, most importantly just to not catastrophize, have you heard that term, catastrophize?  It's distortion of where one thing means much more than [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	When I'm in that kind of mood it's so hard to be able to do that, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  And then on the Xanax, what dose do you have?
<b>PT:</b>	The 1 mg.
<b>CG:</b>	You don't want to try the long acting one?
<b>PT:</b>	I'd rather take.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it'd give you control, but I really want a steady dose.  So Xanax, I'll write here 0.25 to 2 mg every six hours.  All right, so somewhere in that range.  Hear this clearly.  If you get tired, fatigue, slurring, stumbling, you took too much.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  You should get no fatigue at all.  At all.  If you did, you took too much.  Bring it down to the dose that gives you no side effects at all except antianxiety.  'Cause it'll, you know, it'll mop up the anxiety that's there.  But if you're taking more drug than the anxiety, the extra is fatigue.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm also on the Provigil again.  I find it's like—
<b>DR:</b>	It helps your energy.
<b>PT:</b>	Tremendously.  I try not to take it but, you know, it just really helps.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, what prescriptions do you need?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well, I guess if we're changing the Lamictal I need that.  Um, and the Wellbutrin.  That's the only thing we increased.  Oh, and the Abilify.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have enough of that?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, right, and I need that.  Let me ask you a question.  The, like with Abilify, I don't have to break it up, go straight to 10 mg.
<b>DR:</b>	Correct.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't break it up.  And does it matter what time of day I'm taking these things?
<b>DR:</b>	Nope.
<b>PT:</b>	Doesn't matter how I take them.  Okay.  And I don't know if this means anything, but I just want to mention it.  I've been noticing that sometimes at night my arms break out in a rash.  And then it goes away.  This has been happening a lot.  This wouldn't have anything to do with Lamictal, right?
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The Lamictal, you're on what dose, can I give you the 200s?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I guess.
<b>CG:</b>	That'd be two and a half of them.
<b>DR:</b>	All right that you take three.  What else do you need?
<b>PT:</b>	The Abilify.  [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they do.  Let me give you some just in case it doesn't agree with you, I don't want you to have to—
<b>CG:</b>	We have Abilify.
<b>DR:</b>	You have Abilify?
<b>CG:</b>	A little bit, not much.
<b>PT:</b>	We pay $20.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's a very expensive medicine.  Okay.  She'll write your name on this.  Now we have to go through the disability stuff.
<b>PT:</b>	Xanax.
<b>CG:</b>	Xanax and Provigil do you have enough?
<b>PT:</b>	I have enough Provigil.
<b>DR:</b>	That we can call in also.
