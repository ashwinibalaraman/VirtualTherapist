Existential counseling is best described as a
philosophical approach to counseling. The
existential approach helps people who are isolated,
alienated, and not finding meaning in life
to deal with their anxiety by enabling them to
find meaning and purpose in life and to maintain
their identity. Existential counseling does
not provide a specific model of counseling;
rather, it focuses on understanding a variety of
humans' experiences and asks deep questions
about the nature of existence. Existential counseling
focuses on the importance of anxiety,
freedom, meaning, death, isolation, and responsibility.


Existential counseling is considered a
phenomenological approach to counseling and
was developed as a reaction to the two other
major models, psychoanalysis and behaviorism
(Corey, 1996); thus, it is considered a third
force in psychology. Psychoanalytic theory focuses
on forces, drives, and past events affecting
individuals' freedom, whereas behavior theory
assumes that freedom is restricted by external
conditioning. Existential counseling rejects the
notion that our behaviors are determined or
conditioned by outside sources. Clients are not
viewed as sick; rather, they are seen as being
sick of life and needing to recognize their ability
to shape their own lives (Deurzen-Smith,
1988).


This chapter elaborates on the history of existential
counseling by discussing some of the
individuals who have influenced the theory and
practice of the system along with key concepts
associated with the approach. The chapter also
describes the process of existential counseling.

<b>History</b>


Existential counseling draws from a major
orientation in philosophy and was influenced
by a number of philosophers including Kierkegaard
(1813-1855), Dostoyevsky (1821-1881),
Heidegger (1889-1976), Nietzsche (1844-1900),
Buber (1878-1965), and Sartre (1905-1980).
Existential philosophies grew out of a
desire to address people who were experiencing
difficulty in finding meaning and purpose in
life and in maintaining their identity (Holt,
1986). May (1950, 1953, 1961, 1969, 1975,
1983) and Frankl (1963, 1965, 1969, 1978)
probably are the best-known existential theorists.
Moreover, existential counseling was introduced
to the United States in 1958 by May.
Another important figure in existential counseling
is Yalom (1980), who wrote the first comprehensive
textbook in existential counseling,
titled <i>Existential Psychotherapy</i>.


<b>Victor Frankl</b>


Frankl was born in 1905 in Vienna, Austria.
After receiving a medical degree in 1930 and a
Ph.D. in 1949 from the University of Vienna,
Frankl established and supervised youth counseling
centers in Vienna. Frankl became interested
in existentialism during the 1930s and began
working on the manuscript for a book on a
new form of counseling called <i>logotherapy</i>.
Logotherapy comes from the Greek word <i>logos</i>,
which can mean study, word, spirit, God,
or meaning. According to logotherapy, the
striving to find meaning in one's life is the primary
motivational force in humans (Frankl,
1969). But Frankl's efforts were cut short by the
2 years he spent as a prisoner in the German
concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau
during World War II (1942-1945). The time he
spent in the concentration camps crystallized
his thoughts about the meaning of life and suffering,
and it was partly his determination to
share his beliefs that kept him alive. He believed
that the will to meaning is the central drive of
human existence. After the war, Frankl published
many books and gave many lectures
about existential counseling. His best-known
books are <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> (Frankl,
1963, 1984) and <i>The Will to Meaning</i> (Frankl,
1969). He died on September 2, 1997, at 92
years of age.


<b>Rollo May</b>


May is perhaps the most important figure in
American existential psychology. He was born
in 1909 in Ada, Ohio. After earning his bachelor's
degree from Oberlin College in Ohio in
1930, May taught English at an American college
in Greece. He felt a calling to study theology,
returned to the United States, and in 1938
received a bachelor of divinity degree, after
which he worked as a Congregationalist minister
for 2 years. May then began his studies
in psychology at Columbia University. While
working on his doctorate and what would become
his first book, <i>The Meaning of Anxiety</i>
(May, 1950), he spent 1 years struggling with
tuberculosis. In a later book, <i>The Discovery of
Being</i> (May, 1983), he described how this experience
moved him toward the existential viewpoint
and toward his most noted work on the
meaning of anxiety. May continued to lecture
and write books on the subject until his death
on October 22, 1994, at 85 years of age.

<b>Key Concepts</b>


<b>Human Nature</b>


Existential counseling is a dynamic approach
that focuses on concerns rooted in human experience.
What differentiates existential counseling
from other theoretical models is its lack of
emphasis on techniques and frameworks of
therapy; rather, existential counseling emphasizes
the need to understand the humanity of
the client. Existential counselors view the client
as an existing immediate person, not as a composite
of drives, archetypes, and conditioning
(May &amp; Yalom, 1989). Humans in this world
are in a constant state of transition, evolving,
and becoming and have a capacity for awareness,
freedom and responsibility, and meaning
in life. Existential counselors believe that humans
are capable of self-awareness. With self-awareness
comes the ability for freedom in
making decisions and making change.


Existential thinkers are concerned with
one's "being" in this world. Heidegger (1962)
best described being as follows: "Everything we
talk about, everything we have in view, everything
toward which we comport ourselves in
anyway, is Being; what we are is Being, and so is
how we are. Being lies in the fact that something
is, as it is, in reality" (p. 26). To be means to be
present, here and now, but it also means to
project oneself into the future. What is said in
this moment has significance for the next moment
and beyond (Moustakas, 1994, p. 19).
Humans are aware of being and are able to reflect
on it.


Personality theory in existentialism is based
on the belief in "ultimate concerns" of existence
and the anxiety resulting from awareness
of these concerns. In contrast to behavior theory,
existentialism does not concentrate on the
outside world's influence on the personality.
Unlike psychoanalytic theory, existential counseling
believes that a human's basic conflict is
not due to suppressed instinctual drives or to
significant adults in his or her early life; rather,
conflicts are caused by the individual and the
"givens" or ultimate concerns of existence.


<b>Ultimate Concerns of Existence</b>


Yalom (1980) identified four ultimate concerns
of existence as death, freedom, isolation,
and meaninglessness:
<blockquote>
<p>
Each of us craves perdur[ability], groundedness,
community, and pattern; and yet, we must all face
inevitable death, groundlessness, isolation, and
meaninglessness. Existential counseling is based
on a model of psychopathology which posits that
anxiety and its maladaptive consequences are responses
to these four ultimate concerns. (p. 485)
</p>
</blockquote>

meaninglessness. Existential counseling is based
on a model of psychopathology which posits that
anxiety and its maladaptive consequences are responses
to these four ultimate concerns. (p. 485)


It is the awareness of these ultimate concerns
that leads to anxiety and defense mechanisms.


<b><i>Death</i></b>


According to existential counseling, death
plays a major role in our internal experience
and is a source of anxiety (May, 1961). The fear
of death haunts us; it rumbles continuously
under the surface just beneath the rim of consciousness
(Yalom, 1980). The terror of death is
of such magnitude that a considerable portion
of one's life energy is consumed in the denial of
death. Death is a primary source of anxiety and
can result in psychopathology.

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The recognition of death can play a major
role in counseling. An awareness of death shifts
one away from trivial preoccupations and provides
life with depth and poignancy and an entirely
different perspective. It can be the factor
that helps individuals to transcend a stale mode
of living into a more authentic one (Corey,
1996). Awareness of death can help individuals
to embrace life more fully and creatively (May,
1981). In addition to fully embracing life, an
awareness of death can help individuals to appreciate
the countless benefits of existence, that
is, the things for which they can be grateful. Ordinarily,
the things that individuals do have and
what they can do are forgotten, and individuals
focus on what they do not have and what they
cannot do. Awareness of death helps individuals
to be grateful for the many things they have
and experience in life.


<b><i>Freedom</i></b>


The concept of freedom in existential counseling
is linked with the concept of responsibility
(Frankl, 1978). To be aware of responsibility
is to be aware of creating one's own self, destiny,
life predicament, feelings, and suffering.
"Freedom is man's capacity to take a hand in his
own development. It is our capacity to mold
ourselves" (May, 1953, p. 138). For a client
who will not accept such responsibility and persists
in blaming others, no real therapy is possible
(Yalom, 1980). True responsibility is quite
overwhelming. Existential theory assumes that
nothing in the world has significance except by
virtue of one's own creation. There are no
rules, no ethical systems, no values, and so on.
There is no grand design in the universe; it is the
individual alone who is the creator or his or her
existence. People are free to choose alternatives
and, therefore, have a large role in shaping their
destinies (Corey, 1996).


Another aspect of freedom is "willing" or the
awareness of responsibility for one's actions
and the efforts to change. People often might
become aware of their responsibility or aware
of the freedom they have to choose their actions
in a specific situation or problem. Yet, they still
might not change. Willing consists of wishing
and then deciding (May, 1969). Once a person
fully experiences a desire or wish, he or she is
faced with a decision. Thus, freedom consists of
both responsibility and will.


The emphasis in existential counseling on
clients' freedom and responsibility for creating
their situations or problems has been criticized
from a multicultural viewpoint. Some believe
that the realities of racism, discrimination, oppression,
and other forms of environmental circumstances
that may create clients' problems
are not addressed in existential theory (Corey,
1996). Existential counselors need to be aware
of these factors and validate their clients' experiences
while challenging clients to find areas
they can change to improve their situations or
problems.


<b><i>Isolation</i></b>


A third concern in existential theory is isolation
(Yalom, 1980). <i>Existential isolation</i> is a
term meaning that no matter how closely we
feel to another person, each of us enters existence
alone and must leave it alone. It refers to
the unbridgeable gulf between oneself and any
other person as well as a separation between the
individual and the world. An individual never
can fully share his or her consciousness with

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The conflict with isolation occurs between
our awareness of isolation and the wish to be
protected and to be part of a larger whole. Individuals
who are terrified by isolation need the
presence of others to affirm their existence. Individuals
reach out to relationships not because
they want to do so but rather because they believe
that they have to do so. The relationship is
based on survival and the avoidance of the anxiety
caused by fear of isolation; it is not based on
growth.


<b><i>Meaninglessness</i></b>


The fourth ultimate concern is meaninglessness
(Yalom, 1980). If each person must die, if
each person creates his or her own world, and if
each person is alone, then what meaning is
there to life? The human appears to require
meaning. Thus, the questions of "What is the
meaning of life?" "What is the meaning of my
life?" "Why do we live?" and "What do we live
for?" become instrumental in creating anxiety.
Jung believed that meaninglessness inhibited
fullness of life and, therefore, was "equivalent
to illness" (Yalom, 1980, p. 421). He stated that
one third of his cases were suffering not from
any clinically definable neuroses but rather
from the senselessness and aimlessness of their
lives. Finding a meaning or a reason to live relieves
the anxiety that comes with facing a life
and world without comforting structure. However,
it is up to the individual to find meaning in
life (Frankl, 1978).


<b>Anxiety</b>


An existential counselor sees anxiety as an
inevitable aspect of existence (Cohn, 1997).
Anxiety arises from our personal need to survive,
to preserve our being, and to assert our being
(May &amp; Yalom, 1989). Existential theory
distinguishes between normal anxiety and neurotic
anxiety. Normal anxiety is an appropriate
response to an event being faced (Corey, 1996).
This type of anxiety does not need to be repressed
and can be used as motivation for
change. By contrast, neurotic anxiety is out of
proportion to the situation. Persons usually are
unaware of this anxiety, and it can be paralyzing
and can inhibit creativity. The function of therapy
is not to do away with all anxiety but rather
to help clients confront anxiety so as to deal
with specific fears objectively.


Existential theory believes that anxiety is derived
from one's confrontation with "ultimate
concerns" of existence including search for
meaning, awareness of death, freedom and responsibility,
and awareness of isolation (Yalom,
1980). The confrontation with any one of these
ultimate concerns leads to anxiety; however,
the fear of death is the primary reservoir of anxiety.
According to existential theory, it is anxiety
that leads a person to use defense mechanisms.
The existential approach retains Freud's basic
structure but has a different content. The old
Freudian formula of


Drive ? Anxiety ? Defense Mechanism


is replaced by


Awareness of Ultimate Concerns ?
Anxiety ? Defense Mechanism.

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Defense Mechanisms</b>


Regarding the awareness of ultimate concerns
that confront individuals, Yalom (1980)
described two basic forms of defense mechanisms
that people use to cope with their anxiety:
"specialness" and belief in an "ultimate rescuer."
These beliefs can be highly adaptive,
particularly when dealing with death denial.
Each, however, may be overloaded and stretched
thin to the point where adaptation breaks
down, anxiety leaks through, the individual resorts
to extreme measures to protect himself or
herself, and psychopathology develops.


<b><i>Specialness</i></b>


Individuals have deep, powerful beliefs in invulnerability
or immortality (May &amp; Yalom,
1989). Although most people understand rationally
that these beliefs are not true, many hold
to the beliefs at an unconscious level that somehow
we are unique and special. The belief in
specialness typically wards off anxiety resulting
from the reality of our vulnerability to our
harsh world. It enhances our courage to encounter
danger without being overwhelmed by
the threat of personal extinction. For example,
the sense of specialness is beneficial for those in
the armed forces required to face an enemy in
combat. It makes it possible for a soldier to
march into danger when believing, "I won't be
hurt. The other guy may get it, but I'll make it."


The belief in specialness typically is challenged
when an individual learns that he or she
has a serious illness such as cancer. The first reaction
generally is some form of denial, usually
in an effort to cope with anxiety associated with
the threat to life (Yalom, 1980). When the individual
really grasps that death is imminent, he
or she is confronted with the reality
<blockquote>
<p>
that one is finite; that one's life really comes to an
end; that the world will persist nonetheless; that
one is one of many, no more [and] no less; that the
universe does not acknowledge one's specialness;
that all our lives we have carried counterfeit
vouchers; and, finally, [that] certain stark immutable
dimensions of existence are beyond one's influence.
(p. 120)
</p>
</blockquote>


that one is finite; that one's life really comes to an
end; that the world will persist nonetheless; that
one is one of many, no more [and] no less; that the
universe does not acknowledge one's specialness;
that all our lives we have carried counterfeit
vouchers; and, finally, [that] certain stark immutable
dimensions of existence are beyond one's influence.
(p. 120)


When an individual realizes the myth of personal
specialness, he or she may feel angry or
betrayed. Some people believe that if they had
only realized this earlier, they would have lived
their lives differently. Awareness of our lack of
specialness in our world helps us to realize the
unimportance of trivial issues and helps us to
determine what is really important in life.


<b><i>The Ultimate Rescuer</i></b>


The other major mechanism of defense is our
belief in a personal, omnipotent servant who
eternally guards and protects our welfarewho
might let us get to the edge of the abyss but
who always will bring us back (May &amp; Yalom,
1989, p. 381). No early culture ever believed
that humans were alone in this world. Through
much of life, the belief in the ultimate rescuer
provides considerable solace for a number of
human difficulties including fear of death.

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most individuals remain unaware of this defense
mechanism until it fails to serve its purpose.
For example, when a person is confronted
with a fatal illness, he or she may expend a great
deal of energy believing in the ultimate rescuer,
whether it is a supernatural being, medical doctor,
or some other protector. Individuals may
differ in the extent to which they cling to denial
about the seriousness of their illness, but eventually
all denial falls apart in the face of over-whelming
reality.
<blockquote>
<p>
A patient's reaction to learning that no medical or
surgical cure exists is catastrophic. He or she feels
angry, deceived, and betrayed. At whom can one
be angry? At the cosmos? At fate? Many patients
are angry at the doctor for failing them, not for
failing them medically but for failing to incarnate
the patient's personal myth of an ultimate deliverer.
(Yalom, 1980, p. 133)

<b>The Process of Existential Counseling</b>


Existential counseling does not seek to cure or
explain; it merely seeks to explore, describe,
and clarify so as to try to understand the human
predicament (Deurzen-Smith, 1997). May
(1969) believed that therapists should let go of
following strict methodology in favor of focusing
on the richness and breadth of individuals'
experiences. Existential counselors assist clients
in seeing ways in which they are not fully
present in counseling and in the rest of their
lives. Counselors help clients to redefine themselves
and develop greater genuine contact with
life. Clients are encouraged to confront their
anxieties and to develop more effective means
of coping.


Common existential "problems" presented
by clients include personal growth, facing important
decisions, facing death, stage of life crises,
loneliness, meaninglessness, bereavement/loss,
and identity problems (Corey, 1996; May
&amp; Yalom, 1989). Other conditions associated
with defenses to confrontations with existential
concerns include depression, addictions, obsession,
and workaholism.


<b>Goals of Counseling</b>


A basic goal of existential therapy is to help
individuals accept their freedom to act and responsibility
for their actions (Corey, 1996).
Understanding the meaning of freedom means
understanding our responsibility in who we are
and what we do in life (Frankl, 1978). Accepting
that responsibility sometimes is an awesome
task. Although many believe that accepting
our freedom to choose is in many ways
empowering, the new freedom does bring
about anxiety. It is easier to stay in the same pattern
of feeling helpless while clinging to the
known and familiar than to risk oneself in a less
certain and more challenging life. The lack of
guarantees in life is precisely what generates
anxiety (Corey, 1996). Thus, existential therapy
helps clients to face the anxiety of choosing
for themselves and to accept the reality that
they are more than mere victims of deterministic
forces outside themselves.


May (1981) posited that people come to
counseling believing that they are victims of
their circumstances and that others can free
them. Thus, the purpose of counseling is to help
them become aware of what they are doing and
get them out of the victim role. Existential
counselors, therefore, will encourage clients to
accept personal responsibility (Corey, 1996;
May &amp; Yalom, 1989). If clients say, "I can't,"
for example, they will be asked to substitute, "I

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another goal of existential counseling is to
help clients increase their awareness of their finiteness
stemming from personal confrontations
with death (May &amp; Yalom, 1989). Individuals
who are unaware of the reality of death
typically postpone living until sometime in the
future. These individuals rarely live in the present
and may be obsessed by past events or fearful
of anticipated future events. By confronting
their personal deaths, individuals may "count
their blessings and become aware of their natural
surroundings, e.g., changing seasons, seeing,
listening, touching, and loving. Petty concerns
are diminished" (p. 386).


Existential counseling also may examine the
issue of isolation. Clients may discover in counseling
that relationships with others may reduce
their feelings of isolation but not eliminate
them completely. Some individuals have great
difficulty in being alone and may resort to a variety
of behaviors to reduce time spent alone.
These behaviors may include workaholism,
substance abuse, and compulsive behaviors
suited to avoiding the pain of loneliness. These
individuals might have difficulty in expressing
love or relating to other people, but they may
use others to avoid confrontation with the pain
of isolation. In counseling, clients may confront
isolation, learn to be alone, and learn the means
to gaining appropriate support and coping skills.


For some individuals, the issue of meaninglessness
is profound and pervasive (May &amp;
Yalom, 1989) and is important to address in existential
counseling (Frankl, 1969). They may
experience existence as a circle of daily routines
needed to sustain life. May (1953) believed that
the chief problem during the middle decade of
the 20th century was meaninglessness or "emptiness"
(p. 13). The major solution to the problem
of meaninglessness is engagement (e.g.,
helping and caring about others; interest in
ideas or projects; searching, creating, and
building). To help achieve this solution, counselors
might need to explore the blocks of engagement
with clients and determine what prevents
clients from engaging in life.


After gaining insight into the issues of isolation,
meaninglessness, fear of death, and responsibility,
clients clearly are encouraged to
take charge of how they now choose to be in
their world. Effective counseling does not stop
with awareness itself; counselors encourage clients
to take action based on the insights that
they have learned in counseling. Clients are expected
to go out into the world and decide how
they will live differently.


<b>The Counseling Relationship</b>


Existentially oriented counselors strive toward
honest, mutually open, and authentic relationships
with their clients. The central task
and responsibility of the counselor is to seek to
understand the client as a being and as a being in
his or her world. No desks are placed between
the client and counselor. No "authority-aspiring"
diplomas are on the walls. The counselor
and client are on a first-name basis. The counselor
tries to make the client as comfortable as
possible with the counseling process, answering
questions openly and fully. There is no attempt
to bring on transference.


The counselor strives to achieve moments of
authenticity by relating to the client in a genuine
caring fashion. Authenticity is a behavior
pattern whereby decisions stem from being true

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003091-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Existential counselors typically focus on clients'
current life situations, not on helping clients
to recover personal pasts. This does not
mean that counselors discount clients' pasts;
rather, counselors reject the notion that the past
"causes" the present given that such a deterministic
approach denies the ability of humans to
make choices about their lives (du Plock, 1997).


Existential counselors use a variety of counseling
methods and techniques, varying not
only from client to client but also with the same
client at different phases of the therapeutic process
(Corey, 1996). In fact, no set of techniques
is specified or essential in existential counseling.
More important, existential counselors
give central prominence to their relationships
with clients. The relationships are important in
themselves because they are the stimulus for
positive change in clients. The counseling process
is a journey undertaken by both clients and
counselors. In these relationships, counselors
share their reactions to clients with genuine
concern and empathy as a means of deepening
the therapeutic relationships.


<b>The Counseling Process</b>


Ultimately, the process of counseling leads
clients to make changes in their behavior and to
live more meaningful lives. There are three
phases of the process of existential counseling
(Corey, 1996). During the initial stage, counselors
assist clients in becoming aware of and exploring
how the clients perceive and make sense
of their existence. Clients examine their values
and beliefs and become aware of the ultimate
concerns of their existence. Counselors teach
clients how to reflect on their own existence
and focus on freedom (e.g., the clients' role in
creating their problems of living). During the
middle stage of existential counseling, clients
are encouraged to more fully examine where
their value systems come from (e.g., their
sources and authority). This process of self-exploration
leads to clients gaining new awareness
and making decisions to change or restructure
their values and attitudes. The final phase
of existential counseling focuses on helping
clients to put what they are learning about
themselves into action. Clients take responsibility
for change and learn to live a more purposeful
existence.


<b>Conclusion</b>


Existential counseling is a philosophical approach
to counseling. It helps clients by focusing
on the true essence of human life. Existential
counseling does not rely on a strict
treatment model or techniques; rather, the focus
of counseling is on understanding one's being
in the world and the essence of existence.


Existential thinkers view confrontation with
the ultimate concerns of existence as the cause
of anxiety and pathology. The ultimate concerns
of death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness
play major roles in many persons'
problems of living. Individuals who are unaware
of the reality of death typically do not

Existential counselors do not use a specific
set of techniques with clients; rather, importance
is placed on the therapeutic relationship.
The counselor strives toward an honest, open,
and authentic relationship with the client. The
counselor's primary task is to understand the
client as a being and as a being in his or her own
world. Finally, through self-exploration and insight,
the client becomes aware of the ultimate
concerns of existence and his or her freedom in
choosing to make changes and live a more purposeful
life.


<b>Future of Existential Counseling</b>


During the 21st century, the struggle for
meaning in an increasingly information-rich
but personally isolating society will only increase
the need for individuals to find meaning
in the world and in their personal existence.
Approaches to counseling such as cognitive/behavioral
principles will be needed in reducing
symptoms and developing coping skills, but existential
counseling will be essential in helping
individuals to wrestle with the questions of
existence and meaning. As managed care has influenced
the practice of counseling in mental
health settings, the future of existential counseling
might come into question. Clearly, it is
not a method that lends itself to an intervention
process that includes only brief therapy and few
sessions. If present and future counselors wish
to provide this type of counseling, then research
evidence supporting the effectiveness of
existential counseling outcomes will be needed,
and considerations of cost-effectiveness will
need to be addressed.
