<font size="4"><b>6: Practical Issues Related to Maintenance of Mental Health and Positive Well-Being in Family Caregivers</b></font>

Marie is a 67-year-old slightly obese but otherwise reasonably healthy woman
with a high school education who has been caring for her father-in-law over
the past 6 years and her husband, the past 2 years. Her father-in-law was
diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease at age 79 years and soon thereafter
was moved to Marie's home that he might receive closer care and supervision.
Three years later, her husband, at age 63, suffered a stroke resulting in
left-sided weakness, which required that he retire from his work. He became
increasingly depressed over the next 6 months but was still able to perform

The burden of caregiving for Marie is immense, and at times she becomes
so overwhelmed with duties and responsibilities that she just wants "to shut
the door and run away, and never come back." She knows that wouldn't solve
anything, however, and that if she "just keeps plugging away, taking one thing
at a time, somehow or another, things will get done and she'll get through
this." Many nights she is so sad about her husband's condition and her own
plight for the future, she cries herself to sleep. But then the sleep is fitful,
because the interruptions for care are numerous and must be handled. This
leaves her exhausted most of the time but determined to do the very best she
can for her husband and her father-in-law. "They would do the same for me,"
she claims. When the possibility of placement is discussed with her, she
becomes very distressed.


After all they've done for me, I couldn't think of putting either one of them away.
That would be horrible! As long as I'm able, I'm going to do it, and that's the way
it's going to be. You know, being a caregiver has its good points. It's just part of
life. Everybody has to do it. You just have to make the best of it.


Like so many other caregivers, Marie actively searches the community for
resources to aid her with her burdensome tasks. She attends support groups.
She has sought out financial aid and other formal supports, such as day care,
brief in-home respite, assistance with heavy housecleaning, legal advice on
power of attorney and conservator issues, and so forth. She also has remained
active in a number of organizations that are trying to change public policy and
implement new assistance programs for family caregivers. Marie is particularly
concerned about maintaining her own health and support systems so that
she can continue in the role of caregiver as long as necessary.


Marie came to our attention when she responded to an announcement for
our anger management classes. She was very concerned about her irritability
with her husband and her father-in-law. She felt guilty that she got angry and
knew that this impaired her effectiveness. It was just at such times that she
would lose hope and begin to feel that she couldn't go on. She also had read

Marie's situation highlights a number of important issues and questions for the
clinician and researcher interested in caregivers and their problems. For example,
the amount of work and complexity of the day-to-day life problems appear
horrendous to many who are not confronted with this challenge. Is this the
perception of actual caregivers? If so, does the sustained stress of caregiving result
in high levels of psychopathology? What is the likelihood that caregivers might
develop increased physical disorders as well? How are people in Marie's predicament
able to cope and maintain suitable functioning given the sustained nature
of their distress and burden? What role do attitudes and belief systems play? How
do past characteristic strategies for coping help the caregiver? Does the community
provide important support resources that ensure their successful coping?
Should there be special treatments developed for caregivers? What treatment
programs have been developed with the caregiver in mind? Can these available
interventions increase caregivers' abilities to function? Can they reduce the
caregivers' symptoms? What should interested professionals be doing to develop
improved programs and provide better services? Although this manuscript does
not answer all of these questions, a cursory analysis of the relevant literature,
along with impressions culled from our own clinical and research experience
address some of them from a practical perspective. Many await research investigation.
We hope that our presentation here will interest others in developing even
more definitive solutions for the problems of the family caregiver.


<b>Who Are the Family Caregivers?</b>


The person most likely to become a primary caregiver for a disabled family
member is the husband, wife, or daughter of the care recipient (Stone,
Cafferata, &amp; Sangl, 1987). Other relatives, such as daughter-in-laws, may
become involved either as secondary caregivers or when a spouse or adult
daughter is not available. According to data obtained in a 1984 National
Long-Term Care Survey, of the 4.2 million active caregivers in the United
States at that time, 1.6 million were spouses. Furthermore, it was the spouse
group that was far more likely to be primary caregivers. Future projections
indicate that spouses will become even more prominent as caregivers, because

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the present time, the health care system depends heavily on the informal
family network for care of the frail elder in the home setting and less on
institutional support or other health care systems. The majority of this burden
falls in the hands of women, but this pattern may change in future years,
particularly for daughters. It is also the case that more and more women are
becoming single heads of households. Given this trend of increasing employment
combined with increasing household responsibility, the middle-aged
daughter as primary caregiver may be far less common in the year 2020 than
is true today. If this trend holds, then other resources will have to be diverted
to accommodate the increasing needs formerly met by this informal means.


HOW DO CAREGIVERS EXPERIENCE
THE ROLE OF CAREGIVING?


A great deal has been written over the past 15 years about the stress and
burden commonly reported by informal family caregivers. Zarit coined the
term <i>burden</i> to describe the subjective experience of distress that caregivers
reported. Over time, the definition of this construct has evolved to become far
more multidimensional, with an awareness that burden may be social, emotional,
financial, psychological, or physiological (Given et al., 1992). In other
words, the responsibility of providing extensive day-to-day care for a disabled
family relative has an effect on many aspects of the individual's life, not
simply their intrapsychic experience.


At the same time, however, it has become increasingly recognized that
caregivers maintain their role partly for the benefits that they derive from it
(Genevay, 1994). Thus, the extent to which caregiving is a Stressor versus a
positive experience lies in how the caregiving role is defined. For some,
caregiving means a series of tasks (including the provision of care such as
help with feeding, dressing, bathing, and toileting) that require considerable
time, energy, and emotional investment. For others, caregiving refers to a less
extensive range of helping behaviors (such as assistance with balancing the
checkbook, transportation, and food shopping and preparation). For still
others, caregiving is primarily an emotional experience that involves their
giving back to the parent or spouse in gratitude for the life that they have lived
together. Finally, for some, caregiving can be a combination of all of these.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In an effort to bring some clarity to the diverse publications on this topic,
researchers have developed several models to describe relationships among
so-called objective and subjective burden and various psychological resources,
such as the caregiver's degree of self-esteem, ability to use active
cognitive and behavioral coping strategies, and the presence of an adequate
social support network. <i>Objective burden</i> in this case refers to the actual
amount of care required by the care receiver, and <i>subjective burden</i> refers to
how stressful the tasks of caregiving are perceived. In general, these models
have been derivations of the basic stress and coping model of Lazarus and
Folkman (1984) in which an individual's reaction to a stressful event is
thought to be mitigated by the appraisal of the extent of threat associated with
the event as well as the ability to cope with the event itself. Pearlin and
colleagues (Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, &amp; Skaff, 1990), for example, have
emphasized that secondary strains, such as conflicts with other family members,
and intrapsychic strains, such as low self-esteem, can affect outcome
through their effects on the caregiver's coping strength and support network.
Similarly, Vitaliano and colleagues (Vitaliano, Maiuro, Ochs, &amp; Russo, 1989)
developed a model in which distress was regarded as the outcome of the
relationship between the objective Stressor and the psychological, social, and
emotional resources of the caregiver. Such models have been helpful in
accounting for the far-reaching and varied effects of caregiving and in providing
useful frameworks for continued research.


The relationship of the caregiver to the care receiver is an important aspect
of how the caregiving process is experienced. A caregiver who has had a
long-term negative relationship with the care recipient is likely to experience
the process more negatively than one who has had a positive relationship with
the care recipient. Similarly, children are likely to experience caregiving more
negatively than are spouses. Conflicts often occur between caring for a parent
and other responsibilities, such as child care and employment, which has led
to the designation of the <i>sandwich generation</i> for middle-aged women (Brody,
1981). Gender may also affect the caregiver experience. For example, husbands
tend to report less emotional distress than wives (Anthony-Bergstone,
Zarit, &amp; Gatz, 1988; Barusch &amp; Spaid, 1989), and sons report lower rates of
distress than daughters (Brody, Hoffman, Kleban, &amp; Schoonover, 1989;
Horowitz, 1985). However, this trend may be influenced by the fact that
females are more likely to report negative emotions than are males (Nolen-Hoeksema,
1987).


However one may choose to define caregiving, the demands made on
caregivers fluctuate with the course of the care recipients' condition, thus
requiring them to adapt to continually changing responsibilities. As this
process unfolds over time, others in the family often begin to perform different
caregiving activities, and the primary caregiver may come to view the role

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE FOR
CLINICAL DISORDERS IN CAREGIVERS


There can be little doubt about the negative effect of caregiving on primary
caregivers, regardless of the type of disability experienced by the care receiver
(Schulz, Visintainer, &amp; Williamson, 1990). A substantial number of caregivers
report significant symptoms associated with psychopathology, which is described
later. On the other hand, the literature supporting the negative effects of caregiving
on physical health of the caregivers has been less convincing (Schulz et al.,
1990) because the majority of the studies have relied on self-report measures of
health rather than objective evidence. We examined the physical health status of
102 women, aged 50 to 80 years, who were caring for a parent or a spouse with
dementia (Koin et al., 1994) and a subsample of 38 caregivers with a sample of
matched controls (Gallagher-Thompson et al., 1994). In agreement with Schulz
et al. (1990), caregivers rated both their psychological and physical health
negatively, but physical examination and laboratory studies, including a 12-lead
electrocardiogram, revealed them to be in relatively good health when compared
to normal population values for their ages. Calculation of cardiovascular and
stroke risk, using the multivariate risk equations from the longitudinal Framingham
Heart Study (American Heart Association, 1990; Anderson, Wilson, Odell,
&amp; Kannel, 1991; Wolf, D'Agostino, Belanger, &amp; Kannel, 1991) also showed no
differences between the subsample of caregivers and their matched controls.
Furthermore, there were no differences between the two groups in use of
nonpsychotropic medications, but caregivers were much more likely to report the
use of psychotropic medications than control participants.


Returning to the report of psychological problems, the intense level of
distress expressed by many caregivers has led numerous researchers to focus
on the nature and prevalence of affective disorders commonly experienced by
family caregivers. Gallagher, Rose, Rivera, Lovett, and Thompson (1989), for

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Interventions to Support
and Maintain Mental Health</b>


Numerous interventions are available that can reduce emotional disorders
common in caregiving and increase families' ability to cope with the ever
changing demands of the caregiving situation. One must recognize, however,
that caregiving is essentially a family affair and that interventions aimed
specifically at the primary caregiver may be only partially effective. The
context of caregiving and the need to view caregiving as occurring within a
total family system are important. At present, few clinical investigations have
focused on the development of techniques that employ family system strategies.
Attention to this perspective in future research, to embrace the context
within which caregiving activities occur, should lead to productive advances
for assisting caregivers in coping with intense psychological distress.


WHAT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS
ARE AVAILABLE FOR CAREGIVERS?


The wide range of services, which address some of the negative outcomes
of caregiving, can be divided into programs geared more toward environmental

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The question is often asked, "What characteristics of the caregiver or of his
or her profile of symptoms and living arrangements might suggest one type
of intervention over another to be maximally effective?" As noted earlier
(Pearlin et al., 1990), caregivers have careers that can change over time.
Therefore, interventions that might be appropriate at one phase of the disorder
may be less needed at another phase, at which time a different kind of
intervention may be more appropriate. This may also, of course, vary according
to the nature of the disability of the care receiver as well as available social
and family resources, although again, research data are lacking to elucidate
critical factors. There are, however, some suggestions regarding the application
of specific interventions that will be discussed after a description of the
more common mental health services currently used.


<i>Support Groups</i>


These are a very popular form of intervention program. They are widely
available throughout the United States and exist for just about every form of
chronic illness, such as Alzheimer's disease, strokes, Parkinson's disease,
cancers of various kinds, sensory impairments, and diabetes. Typically, the
"parent" organization schedules meetings and arranges for speakers and the
like, and participants attend according to their needs. The support groups are
open-ended and tend to meet monthly, although there is great variability in
how support groups are actually structured in terms of the number of participants,
the frequency of meetings, and the meeting location. Generally, support
groups are led by peers, but some are facilitated by professionals or by people
with specialized training in the particular disease or disability. Participants
are free to speak or not as they see fit at the time, and they may reveal as much
or as little as they wish about their own situation and private feelings.


Support groups are perceived as most helpful in two areas: information
sharing and peer support. In one of the few studies evaluating their effectiveness

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Educational Programs</i>


Presentation of educational programs to family caregivers is a similar type
of intervention but one that focuses less on sharing emotionally laden material.
Caregivers' need for information falls in six general categories: (a) understanding
the relative's condition, (b) improving coping skills, (c) dealing with
family issues, (d) communicating effectively with the frail elder, (e) knowing
appropriate community resources, and (f) long-term planning (e.g., legal and
financial). Programs designed to convey information in one of these categories
can be extremely valuable to caregivers, but they frequently precipitate
intense emotional reactions, particularly when caregivers are faced with
difficult decisions. Thus, educational programs need to recognize and validate
feelings and provide for a certain level at least of interaction and sharing
among participants (Schmall &amp; Pratt, 1989). In fact, much caregiver education
often can be effectively interwoven into the fabric of the monthly support
group meetings sponsored by national organizations for caregiving. On a
practical level, it does appear that the combination of being exposed to useful
information and having the opportunity to process it at least to some degree
on an emotional level is more helpful to family caregivers than the sterile
delivery of facts and procedures in a classroom setting.


<i>Psychoeducational Classes</i>


The <i>psychoeducational</i> model is a more intense intervention focusing on
the personal needs of the caregiver in dealing with the stresses confronted in
caregiving. According to the cognitive-behavioral framework from which
most psychoeducational interventions were developed, participants are presented
not only with new information and given the opportunity to share
feelings and reactions but are also expected to develop skills to enhance their
coping abilities. This skill development occurs through active participation in
the learning process (for example, through the use of role playing and
demonstrations). Most psychoeducational programs have a built-in "homework"
component, which refers to assigned activities between meetings that

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several models for psychoeducational interventions have appeared in the
literature in the past several years, often in the context of a research program
for which participants have been recruited. Their effectiveness has been
demonstrated in a number of studies (Gallagher-Thompson, 1994a; Gallagher-Thompson
&amp; De Vries, 1994; Gallagher-Thompson, Lovett, Rose, &amp;
Futterman, 1994; Greene &amp; Monahan, 1989; Lovett &amp; Gallagher, 1988; and
Whitlatch, Zarit, &amp; von Eye, 1991, with areanalysis of data in Zarit, Anthony,
&amp; Boutselis, 1987). Two other projects reported less positive results in terms
of symptom change, but participants in both reported high levels of satisfaction
with the classes and indicated that they were better able to deal with
interpersonal concerns that arose in typical caregiver problems (Haley, Brown,
&amp; Levine, 1987; Toseland, Rossiter, &amp; Labrecque, 1989).


We have found the psychoeducational approach to be extremely effective
in working with caregivers. As others have noted, the decrease in the actual
symptoms of psychological distress as a result of class participation may
sometimes be unremarkable, but on follow-up, a substantial majority of
participants report that their experience in the class has been immensely
helpful to them in dealing with the myriad problems they encounter. The
consistent announcements across studies by caregivers reflecting the beneficial
nature of these structured group experiences should challenge us to focus
more carefully on what might be reasonable and important outcomes for
treatments used with this population. For example, the level of symptom
distress is highly variable in caregivers, and many who participate in studies
to evaluate these interventions have minimal or no evidence of severe distress
at the outset. Therefore, one shouldn't necessarily expect substantive changes
in symptoms in all cases. Furthermore, the plight of the caregiver often is a
life filled with numerous heart-wrenching events, which occur in a seemingly
random fashion, independent of treatments. This being the case, improvements
in level of distress might often be temporarily obliterated, even though
important changes in ways of coping and other behavioral functioning are
either clearly in evidence or are in their formative stages.


Because depression and anger are frequently the two most prevalent negative
emotions experienced by caregivers, we have focused on the development
of two psychoeducational programs to help caregivers deal with them. The

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I003&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

A brief description of the content of each of these two intervention programs
can be found in Tables 6.1 and 6.2. Participant and leader instruction

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Support groups, education programs, and psychoeducational programs may
not be sufficient or appropriate for all caregivers. For example, some individuals
are experiencing such distress that they need one-on-one time to talk extensively
about their problems to better understand their feelings and options. Other

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Individual Psychotherapy</i>


There are few studies describing the application of psychotherapy to extremely
distressed caregivers. However, it appears that even relatively brief interventions,
such as 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, can be extremely helpful in enabling the caregiver
to become "unstuck" and proceed with their lives (Baum &amp; Gallagher, 1985).
Some individuals may then be able to benefit more from a group participation
program, either by itself or in combination with continued therapy. As mentioned
earlier, the optimal psychotherapy for a given caregiver may change depending
on contextual features of the actual caregiving process. For example, we found
that overall, brief psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapy had a comparable
beneficial effect on caregivers who were diagnosed as suffering from
major depressive disorder. Those patients who were caregivers for less than 44
months, however, responded much better to the psychodynamic therapy, whereas
those who were caregivers for longer than that responded best to the cognitive-behavioral
approach (Gallagher-Thompson &amp; Steffen, 1994). In attempting to
explain this interaction, we noted that permission to grieve was an integral
component in the particular model of short-term psychodynamic therapy that we
used, which may be a particularly important process in the early stages of
caregiving when the individual caregiver is coming to grips with the loss of the
person that they once knew as well as the loss of many future possibilities and
plans. The long-term caregivers, on the other hand, may have benefited more from
a cognitive-behavioral approach because its emphasis on practical problem
solving in the here and now may have increased their self-efficacy perceptions
and their hope and expectancy for more effective coping, thus making it possible
to function with less distress in their roles.


No matter what type of intervention we use to treat emotional distress in
caregivers, we have found, as you might suspect, that any strategy that improves
the caregiver's sense of efficacy in dealing with behavioral problems posed by
the care recipient or actually improves the care recipient's functioning invariably
has a positive effect on the caregiver's level of psychological distress. In this
regard, modifications of more specialized behavioral therapy approaches, often
used in long-term-care settings where a variety of behavioral problems are
encountered, can be extremely effective. These rely heavily on the antecedent-behavior-consequence

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Family Therapy</i>


As noted earlier, caregiving is a family affair, and although traditional
family therapy approaches have been found to work with the elderly (Herr &amp;
Weakland, 1979; Qualls, 1988), there is very little in the literature on how

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

WHAT ARE THE DECISION RULES<br />
FOR SELECTING INTERVENTIONS?


The problem of deciding what interventions are most appropriate for a
given caregiver client has not been addressed in any great detail in the
professional literature. Past clinical experience and clinical "lore" are often
the only available resources for developing a clinical program to assist a
distressed caregiver. Some decisions are fairly obvious, however, and can be
made with minimal concerns about their effectiveness in ameliorating caregiver
distress. For example, if a major clinical diagnosis, such as dysthymic
disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, can be made and the person is
seeking help, a referral to a mental health professional is clearly appropriate.
We have found that short-term psychotherapy is usually helpful with such
patients, and their progress can sometimes be facilitated with a combination
of therapy and psychotropic medications (Thompson &amp; Gallagher-Thompson,
1991). Medication alone, however, is not usually the treatment of choice for
severely distressed caregivers. Most often, their psychological problems have
been precipitated by the stresses of caregiving, and they need to develop the
psychological resources to cope with the problems that continually arise.


The psychotherapy modality to use may vary, not only across patients but
also within patients, depending on how long they have been in the caregiving
role and how their available support system might have changed. In the first
few years of caregiving, issues concerning loss and grief may need as much
or more attention than concerns about coping with the problems being confronted.
Therapies designed to integrate grief work along with other techniques tend to

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With regard to individual differences, distressed caregivers who seem to
have adequate resources to provide respite and some pleasurable experiences
for themselves and their care recipients may benefit more if the primary focus
is on the negative cognitions that they have about themselves, their situations,
and their futures. For example, the caregiver may have unrealistic expectations
about his or her responsibility for the care recipient's well-being or may
be distorting life events by "all or none" thinking. The caregivers might
believe, for example, that their happiness is dependent solely on the condition
of the persons for whom they are caring, "The only way I could ever be happy
again is for John to be well," or, "Life will never have meaning for me without
sharing things with George, and I mean sharing so that he understands."
Cognitive therapy can aid caregivers in modifying such beliefs as well as
identifying ways in which they might be distorting events to support irrational
belief systems. If the caregiver has few financial and social resources to
provide for some modicum of pleasure for themselves, then a useful first step
in therapy is to help them find ways within their means to increase their levels
of pleasure and relaxation while maintaining the caregiver role. This can involve
a wide range of behavioral techniques, from teaching them how to be assertive
in recruiting family and other community resources for assistance to learning
covert techniques for quick relaxation in the face of acutely stressful events or
acquiring improved skills for time use. Often, caregivers may have ample
resources for making their situation more comfortable but may be living by a rule
of "fairness," such that engaging in pleasurable activities for one's own enjoyment
is not acceptable when their loved one has to suffer. "Donald's needs, not
mine, must always come first." This problem is sometimes easily overcome
if the caregiver can gain the perspective that it is important for them to take
care of themselves so that they can be maximally effective in caring for the
person that needs their assistance. As one patient put it, "I see now. You know
it's like they say in the airplane drill. Put on your oxygen mask first so that
you'll be OK, and then you can help the child put on theirs."


Although help-seeking may well be the rule rather than the exception
among caregivers, most who are looking for help do not identify themselves

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many of the interventions available to caregivers can complement one
another and, if available, could be offered simultaneously or interspersed
sequentially. Indeed, left to their own devices, caregivers often are inclined
to use as many and varied services as their limited time and financial resources
will permit. We have found the support group and psychoeducational classes
to be particularly effective when offered sequentially. Particularly after attending
support groups where they have had an opportunity to share their
concerns with others and gain some information about resources available,
caregivers begin to have some realization that they need more than just the
support of others in similar predicaments. As a result, they require less
socialization into a group format and appear open and receptive to learning
new techniques to help them alleviate their burdens. This in turn improves
time use and effectiveness of the classes, which are typically time-limited and
brief.


As noted earlier, caregiver satisfaction with such programs is high, and
many feel that their functional capabilities are maintained or enhanced by
virtue of their participation. Appropriate summative evaluations of many
caregiver interventions to determine their effect on health care costs, timing
of institutionalization of care recipient, and quality of life for family members
are generally not available. In view of what is known about the burden of

In our experience, a pivotal feature in making the decision to institutionalize
a family member revolves around a deterioration in medical or psychological
health status, in either the caregiver or care recipient, to such a degree
that the caregiver feels it is no longer possible to provide adequate care in the
family setting. In addition to the objective changes contributing to the caregiver's
perception, subjective factors such as the caregiver's sense of adequacy
and control in the situation and willingness to engage in new problemsolving
behaviors to overcome the negative changes also play an important
part. Furthermore, these subjective factors are influenced heavily by negative
emotions, such as depression and anxiety. Thus, the more depressed or
anxious the caregiver becomes, the less their sense of efficacy in dealing with
stressful events, and the less they may be willing to continue their role as a
family caregiver. Amelioration of negative emotions, then, is likely to have a
positive effect on the caregiver's perception of their ability to function as a
caregiver and thereby their willingness to continue in this role. Testimony of
numerous caregivers in our work suggests that the psychoeducational class
format has a definite positive effect on quality of life indicators and may have
beneficial effects concerning health costs and time of placement as well. The
case example to follow illustrates the magnitude of the effect that often occurs
as a result of a simple 8-week class on improving life satisfaction:
<blockquote>
<p>
Betty, a 51-year-old married female, lives with her husband, daughter, son-in-law,
and 74-year-old mother who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She has been
the primary caregiver for the mother over the past 4 years but receives some
assistance from her children in supervising the mother when she is required to
leave the home. The family owns a small business in which all members are
employed, which enables Betty to work in the home and permits her some
flexibility in the hours that she works. She also assumes responsibility for
preparing meals and keeping the house in order. The mother's dementia has
progressed to a moderate level. She has become very demanding on Betty's time
and attention. Although she has lived with the family for 4 years, she thinks she
has been a guest there for only a short period and therefore is entitled to be
pampered by her daughter. In social gatherings, such as meal times or entertaining
guests, if she is ignored for any length of time, she becomes angry and runs off
to her room. At the time Betty entered the class, she would react to her mother's
emotional outbursts by becoming extremely distressed and guilty and would run
after her to console her. In every social gathering she would constantly focus on
her mother and attempt to work her into the conversation in some way to prevent
a problem from arising, but of course, this strategy repeatedly failed because of
the mother's limitations. Betty's relationships with other family members was
becoming strained, particularly with her husband, and she noted that she was
constantly in need of a doctor's care. Dreadful as it was, she had begun to think

about placement of her mother because she was fearful that the strained relationship
with her husband might lead to a separation or divorce. She had actually
visited a nursing home to work out the details, but the agony of this decision was
becoming increasingly detrimental to her level of functioning.

Content and homework assignments in the Life Satisfaction Class provided
Betty with objective data that she was engaging in virtually no pleasant activities,
and she was doing nothing in her daily life with her own interests in mind. The
rationale presented in class for increasing pleasurable activities, in combination
with the encouraging support of the class, motivated Betty to evaluate the effect
of increasing the frequency of pleasant activities in her life. The results were
remarkable. The comfort she experienced by the increase in pleasurable activities
provided credibility for the principles outlined in the course and set the stage for
her to examine her reaction to her mother's irrational demands. Through class
discussions, she accepted the realization that she was not responsible for her
mother's problems and therefore did not have to feel guilty or put her mother's
interests before her own. This led to a self-change plan of ignoring her mother's
outbursts. The plan was successful, which enabled Betty to feel much more in
control of the relationship with her mother. She subsequently became more
relaxed. Her relationship with her husband improved immensely. She became
more assertive in asking for help from the children in the home. She was enjoying
life again and still able to care for her mother. At our 6-month follow-up, plans
for the mother's placement had been dropped, doctor's visits had stopped, and
she described her relationship with her husband as like a second honeymoon.


In Betty's case, the outcome of her plight would probably have been more
negative without intervention. She was considering placement; the family
system was disrupted and becoming more disorganized; health costs were
increasing. Placement might actually have led to even greater strain in the
family because her emotional state would probably have continued to deteriorate
due to the guilt. However, her attendance in the class delayed placement
and clearly gave her an increased sense of how to deal with her many
seemingly insurmountable problems in caring for her mother.


<b>Progress and Prospects in
Caregiving Research and Practice</b>


Reflecting on the literature related to caregiving, several conclusions can
be drawn.


First, it is clear that the burden of caregiving can be, at times, almost beyond
comprehension. It truly is a "36-hour day" for some, and this may go on for
years with little expectation of more than just temporary respite from the
burdensome duties. There are, however, some positive aspects to caregiving,
and this feature is often overlooked. What are these positive features and how
can we capitalize on these to improve the plight of the caregiver?

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Second, many caregivers are able to function capably in this role for
unbelievably long periods. The thought of relinquishing their responsibilities
is taken seriously only when there is a transition in health status of themselves
or their care recipient that renders it no longer feasible for them to provide
responsible, high-quality care. What are these danger signals, and what can
we do to minimize their occurrence in the lives of caregivers?


Third, caregivers can experience incredible psychological distress, and in
a sizable proportion, their symptoms may actually warrant a diagnosis of
psychopathology. Yet in the face of high distress levels, they manage to
function and cope with the day-to-day tasks inherent in the role. Caregiving
is often viewed as a naturally occurring process in the life cycle, and therefore,
serious stresses and strains are to be expected and dealt with as part of life's
trials and tribulations. Thus, although symptoms of an emotional disorder may
be manifest, conceptualizing the problem in a framework of psychopathology
may not be the most productive strategy for the researcher or the practitioner.
The development of useful models would greatly facilitate basic and clinical
research efforts.


Fourth, although there is an increase in mental health problems in caregivers,
there is some question as to whether they have more physical health
problems than noncaregivers with the same age and socioeconomic status.
This raises the questions of whether our measurements of physical health are
not sensitive enough to detect change, whether enough time has elapsed in the
caregiving for physical health problems to be manifest, or whether physical
health changes are likely to occur only in those individuals who are taxed
beyond the availability of their internal and external resources. These issues
deserve particular attention in subsequent research.


Fifth, caregivers are in need of increased resources, and for the most part,
they actively seek assistance both from formal and personal support systems.
It's not all that clear, however, as to what resources might be maximally
effective and how they should be adapted to the special needs of caregivers.
This chapter highlights some of the interventions currently available to help
caregivers address their mental health needs and to help them achieve a better
quality of life. Many caregivers are using these available services, but the lack
of an organized approach to research in this field has limited our ability to
understand which interventions would be most appropriate for which caregivers
at which stages of their caregiving careers.


Sixth, some studies have shown that structured group interventions designed
specifically with the caregiver in mind are helpful, but others have
reported no difference between these and general support groups. Furthermore,
changes in emotional symptoms have been modest at best, although the
majority of caregivers who participated in specific treatments report that the
interventions have been extremely helpful. Several methodological problems

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Seventh, there have been few outreach efforts specifically devoted to the
needs of subgroups, such as the identification of male caregivers and development
of programs to meet their particular needs. Some years ago, Davies,
Priddy, and Tinklenberg (1986) described some of the qualitative differences
that they noted in running a support group for male caregivers versus running
one that was predominately attended by women. Men wanted more practical
help, such as how to do the cooking and cleaning and the bathing and dressing
of the frail elder, with very little discussion of their feelings and little sharing
of feelings with other group members. This is one of the few reports in the
literature that could guide clinicians in setting up clinical research programs
to address the situation of elderly male caregivers.


Last, the specific needs of ethnic minority elders and their families have
been largely unmet by the current service delivery system. Yet their proportion
in the population will continue to grow in the years ahead and so it would
be prudent to plan ahead and learn as much as one can about the relevant
cultures to develop specific programs that truly reflect the communities and
the peoples whom they are intended to serve. Similarly, little attention has

<b>Summary</b>


The purpose of this chapter is to describe characteristics of family caregivers
of frail elders, to point out the kinds of stress and negative affects that
they typically experience in the role of caregiver, and to review a variety of
intervention strategies designed to improve their mental health and well-being.
Also, the issue of caregiving as a family affair is addressed. The chapter
closes by raising a number of issues to be addressed in future clinical research,
such as the development of interventions specifically for male caregivers and
for ethnic minorities.
