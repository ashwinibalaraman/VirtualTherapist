<font size="4"><b>Anxiety: Its Meaning and Measurement</b></font>

Anxiety emerged as a central problem and a predominant
theme of modern life in the 20th century,
which the French author Albert Camus referred to as
"the century of fear" (May, 1950/1977). The <i>Age of
Anxiety</i> was the title of both Leonard Bernstein's
Second Symphony and a poetic work by W. H. Auden
(May, 1950/1977). Inspired by Bernstein's music and
Auden's poem, Jerome Robbins choreographed a contemporary
ballet, which he also titled the <i>Age of
Anxiety</i> (Mason, 1954). The significant impact of anxiety
in literature, music, art, and religion, as well as in
psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and psychology, was
cogently described by Rollo May (1950/1977) in his
classic book, <i>The Meaning of Anxiety</i>, May also documents
concern with anxiety in the philosophical
work of Pascal, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and, especially,
Kierkegaard and Spinoza, who considered fear
to be a state of mind characterized by the expectation
that something painful or unpleasant might happen.


Although the pervasive influence of anxiety on
human behavior was not generally recognized until
the 20th century, concerns with fear are as old as the
history of humankind. The concept of fear was clearly
represented in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, the
Old Testament, and in Greek and Roman literature
(May, 1950/1977). The importance of fear was clearly
recognized by Charles Darwin (1872/1965), who considered
this emotion to be an inherent characteristic
that had evolved in both humans and animals as
an adaptive response over countless generations.
Observable manifestations of fear included: rapid palpitations
of the heart, trembling, increased perspiration,
changes in voice quality, erection of the hair, and
peculiar facial expression. Consistent with contemporary
definitions of anxiety, Darwin observed that fear
varied in intensity, from mild apprehension or surprise,
to an extreme "agony of terror."


The physiological manifestations that Darwin
attributed to fear were also recognized as symptoms
of anxiety by Sigmund Freud (1933/1959, 1936).
However, Freud emphasized the experiential qualities
of anxiety, which he defined as "something felt," an
unpleasant emotional state characterized by subjective
feelings of chronic apprehension, and by "all that is
covered by the word 'nervousness'" (1895/1924,
p. 79). The perceived presence of danger, according to
Freud, evoked an anxiety state that served to warn the
individual that some form of adjustment was necessary.
Stimulated by psychoanalytic theory, clinical
studies of anxiety have been reported in the psychiatric
literature with increasing regularity Pavlov's
(1927) discovery of experimental neurosis also stimulated
numerous investigations of fear and anxiety in
animals. However, prior to 1950, there were relatively

[p. <i>60</i>]

The Taylor (1951, 1953) Manifest Anxiety Scale
(TMAS) was the first of a number of widely used psychometric
instruments designed to assess anxiety in
adults. The rationale for constructing the TMAS,
which has been used extensively in research on motivation
and learning (Spence &amp; Spence, 1966), was
based on the assumption that anxious people are
chronically more emotional and consistently higher in
motivation or drive level than persons low in anxiety.
The 50 TMAS items were selected from the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(Hathaway &amp; McKinley, 1942, 1951) on the basis of a
textbook description of the symptoms observed in
patients with anxiety neurosis (Cameron, 1947), a
clinical syndrome first identified by Freud
(1895/1924). Respondents to the TMAS report
whether or not each item describes how they generally
feel.


The TMAS, Cattall's (1957) Anxiety Scale
Questionnaire (ASQ; Cattell &amp; Scheier, 1963), the
Affect Adjective Check List (AACL; Zuckerman,
1960; Zuckerman &amp; Lubin, 1965), and the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, 1983;
Spielberger, Gorsuch, &amp; Lushene, 1970) are the psychometric
instruments that have been most frequently
used to assess anxiety in research and clinical practice
over the past 50 years. Cattell and his colleagues
(Cattell, 1966; Cattell &amp; Scheier, 1958, 1963) pioneered
the use of multivariate techniques in the
assessment of anxiety, and identified trait and state
anxiety as unique constructs. As currently defined
(Spielberger, 1966, 1972a), trait anxiety (T-Anxiety)
refers to relatively stable individual differences in
anxiety proneness as a personality trait or disposition,
whereas state anxiety (S-Anxiety) is defined as a transitory
emotional condition that varies in intensity and
fluctuates over time. The 40-item Anxiety Scale
Questionnaire (ASQ) developed by Cattell and
Scheier (1963) provides an objective measure of individual
differences in trait anxiety, and is highly correlated
with the TMAS. The IPAT 8-Parallel Form
Anxiety scale was developed to assess S-Anxiety by
Scheier and Cattell (1960), but there is little evidence
of the construct validity of this measure.


The AACL developed by Zuckerman (1960), with
adjectives that describe the presence or absence of
anxious feelings, assesses both state and trait anxiety.
Respondents check each of the 21 AACL adjectives to
indicate <i>how they feel on the day the test is given</i>
(S-Anxiety), and then check these same adjectives to
indicate <i>how they generally feel</i> (T-Anxiety). The concepts
of state and trait anxiety, as refined and elaborated
by Spielberger (1966, 1972a, 1972b, 1977,
1979), provided the conceptual framework for constructing
the STAI, which was intended to provide
reliable, relatively brief, self-report scales for assessing
state and trait anxiety in research and clinical
practice (Spielberger et al., 1970).


In developing the STAI, the initial goal was to identify
a single set of items that could be administered with
different instructions to assess the intensity of
S-Anxiety and individual differences in T-Anxiety.
Items adapted from existing anxiety measures, along
with a number of new items, were administered, first
with state and then with trait instructions, to large samples
of university students and psychiatric patients.
Based on extensive item-validity research with more
than 2,000 study participants, 20 items were selected
for the preliminary form of the STAI. However, subsequent
research indicated that altering the instructions
could not overcome the strong state or trait psycholinguistic
connotations of the key words in a number of
items (Spielberger et al., 1970). (For example, "I worry
too much" was stable over time and correlated highly
with other T-Anxiety items, but scores on this item did
not increase in response to stressful circumstances, nor
did they decrease under relaxed conditions, as required
for the construct validity of an S-Anxiety item. In contrast,
"I feel upset" was a highly sensitive measure of S-Anxiety;
item scores increased markedly under
stressful conditions and were lower under relaxed conditions.
However, when given with trait instructions,
the scores for this item were unstable over time and correlations
with other T-Anxiety items were relatively low.)


Given the difficulties encountered in measuring
state and trait anxiety with the same items, the best
items for assessing S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety were
selected for the STAI (Form X). When given with trait
instructions, the 20 items with the best concurrent
validity, as indicated by the highest correlations with
the TMAS and the ASQ, and that were stable over
time, were selected for the T-Anxiety scale
(Spielberger et al., 1970). The 20 Items with the best
construct validity when given with state instructions,

[p. <i>61</i>]

In the construction and standardization of the STAI
(Form Y), more than 5,000 additional subjects were
tested. Factor analyses of the Form Y items identified
distinct state and trait anxiety factors (Spielberger,
Vagg, Barker, Donham, &amp; Westberry, 1980), which
were similar to those found in previous factor studies
of the Form X items (Gaudry, Spielberger, &amp; Vagg,
1975). However, the Form Y factors were more differentiated
and had better simple structure than the corresponding
Form X factors, reflecting "purer" measures
for assessing state and trait anxiety in adolescents and
adults, and a better balance in the number of T-Anxiety
present and absent items (Spielberger et al., 1980).
Since the STAI was first published more than 30 years
ago (Spielberger et al., 1970), this inventory has been
translated and adapted in 62 languages and dialects,
and cited in more than 14,000 archival studies.
