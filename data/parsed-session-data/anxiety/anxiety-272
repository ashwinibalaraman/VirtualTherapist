That first night at home I had a dream. I dreamed
I was in a deep, black, smooth-sided pit. Far over my head was
a glimmer of light, the mouth of the pit, its exit. But there was
no foothold on the smooth sides of the pit for escape toward
that light about me.... Suddenly I sat up in bed screaming a
long, moaning "<i>Ahhhhhhh</i>" of terror.


Marilyn put her arms around me. "It's all right, honey. It's
all right, honey. Go on back to sleep. It was just a nightmare.
You're safe at home. Everything is all right...."


She was with me all the time during this week end at home.
I couldn't free myself of her. And I couldn't kill myself with
Marilyn near. I couldn't bring myself to that.


Sunday of that week end, Marilyn mentioned that the Foundation
had to have a definite answer right away whether I
wanted my job back when I was discharged from the hospital.
I told her no, that whatever happened, I felt I couldn't return
to my old job. With my answer I cut myself off from that phase
of my past life. Marilyn said she'd let them know and that was
that.


After this visit home I returned to the hospital. As my talks
with Dr. Andrews progressed, I sensed that he felt that the basic

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In any event, I co-operated with him and the hospital program
as best I could with only one desperate hope in mind: that I
would be released as soon as possible so that I could be free to
do whatever I chose to do with myself.


Then the day came when I was discharged, and Dr. Andrews
wrote a note that I could show any possible employers concerning
my stay in the hospital. It said I was now in my "normal
state of good health."


But my neck still felt stiff and my cheeks still felt numb and
tight. So did the top of my head. And my eyes still felt strange.
But neither Dr. Andrews nor anyone else at the hospital knew
how I felt physically, nor, as far as I could tell, how these feelings
had come about. I had been in the hospital a little more
than three months when I was discharged.


... I walked into the apartment. It was Saturday. I was free.
"Marilyn, it's Bob. Marilyn... where are you?"


By the phone in the living room there was a note: "Honey, if
you get here before I'm back, I'm at the grocery...."


In the kitchen on top of the kitchen table there was a chocolate-iced
cake. Orange lettering wreathed its top: "Welcome Home,
Bob!"


I looked at the cake with its gay lettering. Marilyn's fond

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first two or three Weeks out of the hospital were of a pattern.
I would drive Marilyn to work in the morning. I would
return home. There, self-caged in the apartment, I would read
a little, sleep a lot. I would wash the breakfast dishes. I would
empty the garbage. And I would think. And think and think
and think: how to break out of the strange trap into which I'd
fallen. Dr. Andrews had said, and written, that I was in my
"normal" state of good health. And to escape from the hospital,
I had, in a lie, agreed with him, and I had by my actions attempted
in every way I could to indicate that this lie was so.


Now, I <i>was</i> able, most of the time, to look people in the eye
when I talked to them. As long as I wasn't around any one person
too long, I could carry on a conversation of a kind. But still,
in talking to people, I would quickly find myself with nothing
more to say. Nothing. And when that time came, I would want
to run from them, to hide.


My neck still ached. My eyes felt bruised; I can explain that
feeling no other way. There was still a numbness along my
cheeks and at the top of my skull.


During this period I told Marilyn about the suicide attempt
and the physical sensations I'd had since that time. She suggested
I tell this to Dr. Andrews and when I told her I was afraid
to do that, she sent me to our friend, Dr. Nathan Clarke. Very
carefully and in detail I told Doc what had happened to me,
and I also told him I thought perhaps I should have a complete
physical examination on the possibility I'd injured my brain.


He said my symptoms indicated no physical injury. He said
he was certain they were the result of psychological trauma and
there was nothing to be gained by my checking further. Trusting
him, I decided to follow his advice, which was to simply ignore
the aching in my neck and my other feelings of physical discomfort.

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I reported to Dr. Andrews each week, feeling like a freed
convict visiting his parole officer. I had the fear that if I didn't
tell him of attempts during the week to find work he would ask
me to return to the hospital. So during this period, each week,
I would make some token effort toward getting a job. And each
week when I saw Dr. Andrews, I would go into great detail, with
a display of false enthusiasm, concerning these efforts.


I was careful to explain to him that I wanted to find a position
in keeping with my experience in public relations. He agreed
that this was logical. I was anxious that he know that it was
not easy to step right out into a job in this field, that it was
very limited, that it was very competitive. He said he understood.


Sometimes I almost talked myself into believing that I could
really find a job and hold it. But inwardly I think I knew that
this was only a fantasy.


Now, during this time, an idea took hold of me which was, I
believe, the first of a chain of events that influenced me, very
quickly, toward a change of personality. This may not be true.
It may be there were additional happenings, both inside me and
out, affecting me in ways I was not aware of, which were the true
keys to the doors which opened on the new mood soon to possess
me, which closed on the old mood of depression which had possessed
me. But I can only tell of what I consciously know. I
cannot tell of that which my unconscious will not tell me....


... I was in the apartment one morning. I was reading want
ads in the morning paper. Not really reading them. I was looking
at them blindly. My mind was some place else. I had not
given up the idea of suicide as an alternative to my present condition.
Since my discharge my most urgent conscious reason
for wishing to remain unconfined had been that my liberty left
me free to destroy myself should the time come again when it
seemed the thing for me to do. Now, as I was reading the paper,

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The thought may have been an echo of Hank Larsen's thoughts
as he told them to me in the hospital... perhaps not. I had
thought about hell before, but always to reason against its possibility.
Despite my Catholic background, I'd never given much
thought, when I was growing up, to spiritual matters. By the time
I was eighteen and in the Air Corps in World War II, away from
my parents, I'd quit making any pretense of faith in religion.


I'd thought about hell several times before becoming sick but
only as an intellectual exercise. I'd been proud of myself on
two or three occasions in conversations on hell with priests. I'd
felt my argument was neat: "If there is a God and if He is Good
and if He is all powerful, there can be no such thing as hell. A
good God would not call into existence eternal misery...."


I said this to a young man on a train once. He was on his way
to a monastery. We'd been seated together and we had a long
talk. I had listened politely to him but I'd been enthusiastic
about my own line of argument and I'd listened to him only with
the attention necessary to give him good rebuttal....


"Furthermore," I'd said, "you say a man must first have a
true awareness of the evil he does before he will be held responsible
for it. So a man would have to know what hell is, really
know, before he could be fully aware of the evil of an act which
would send him there. Man's awareness is finite. Hell is a concept
of infinity. Therefore, even if there were such a place as
hell, no man would be sent there by a just God, simply because
no man can truly conceive infinite consequence to an act by a
finite creature."


I had been exhilarated by my argument with this young man.
I'd been pleased with myself. After our trip he had sent me
several long letters, answering in more detail the objections I
had raised during our discussion.


I'd never bothered to answer the letters, but I had filed them

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"... Bob, we are on trial. God created us for an eternity of
love in Him, in Heaven. But if we deny our purpose here (our
trial), after death we will go to a place of our own choosing
which will not be Heaven and that will be Hell. We are going
to live forever, but if we deny our purpose and seek our heaven
on earth, we pervert our means into our end, and in this perversion
we will find Hell.


"... God is Charity and Justice is of Charity and the only
creatures in Hell will be those who, in the Justice of God, have
foreseen sufficiently the evil of their acts to be responsible for
them. God is our Judge. He is Good. Have trust in Him. He
loves you....


"... God created all things good. The land, the sea, all living
things... everything. Out of His Love came all things.
And the height of God's creation are the angels and man—creations
capable of loving by <i>choice</i>. And the most wonderful act
of a free creature is to return the love of its Creator....


"And the most monstrous act, the Frankenstein act, is for the
creature to reject its Creator. In such a turning from God, man
will find an eternal nothingness, an eternal lack of Love, which
is Hate, which is Hell.


"The Creator gives His creatures myriad gifts as a symbol
of His Love. But if, like selfish children, we spurn the Giver
for the gifts, we lose the greater good. And if we, during our
trial here, continually make our decisions in favor of the gifts
against their Giver, then, in this rejection of Love for the symbols
of love, we find an ultimate Hell.


"... God loves His creation, Man. Man was created with a
need for God. Until Man is one with God, he cannot be at peace.
And Hell is the separation of Man who can never be entire in
finite love from God, who is infinite Love.


"This is a mystery, Bob. A mystery does not contradict our

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"... You will find neither Heaven nor Hell here on this earth.
There will be times when you will imagine you have found both.
But these times will be only hints of those infinities that are not
of this world...."


The letters were about four years old. The paper on which
they were written had started to yellow. But to me the words on
the paper burned with life. When I had first received the letters,
I had read them hastily, without emotional reaction except for
a slight surge of pity for the writer, so sadly deluded, I felt, in
his blind faith.


But now, on this second reading, my mind told me, <i>Yes, what
is said here about Hell is true. Hints of Hell you've had aplenty.
A man is stripped of faith in what he trusted, be it of himself
or outside himself.... A man is divested of those fine gifts
that make a man—his courage, his patience, his capacity for
love. A man knows what might have been his but now can never
be—a son—or it might be a God—lost beyond recall for lack
of love.... A man is stripped of all gifts save one—existence
itself—and in their place a man is filled with an empty nothingness
we label hate which is not anything but lack of love, as cold
is not anything but lack of heat</i>.


My mind told me these things, not spelled out as here, but in
a spinning surge of emotion in which the vehicle of thought was
carried by silent elemental sounds by me, to me.


<i>Hell fire must burn by freezing</i>, came the thought to me.
With this, the mood passed. In its intensity it had lasted only
an instant. When it subsided my problems were the same, but
I had cut off my final avenue of escape from them. I could no
longer consider suicide a way out. Out of this moment, out of
this quick growth of conviction, I rejected suicide as my escape.

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And out of this moment my life took a swift, strange turn as
I began a course influenced out of my illness and influencing
my illness.


I returned to the Catholic faith into which I had been born.
I did this alone. Marilyn did not join me. She could not, for
what moved me did not move her. She remained a Methodist.
For my sake, though, so I could have what I claimed I had to
have, we were remarried in the Catholic Church about one
month after my discharge.


She did this thing to help me, in hope it might be an instrument
in the lifting of my depression. When it did lift, but only to
give way to another mood more strikingly symptomatic of illness
than its predecessor, she was filled with a rising mixture
of bitterness touched with apprehension, with fear, with terror.
All these emotions became mingled into her love for me. At this
time, in my illness, I could only attribute her resentment of
Catholicism to a stubborn, willful blindness. I could only attribute
her moments of apprehension to cowardice, to a lack of
trust in me. For as the new mood replaced the old, as I grew
all the time more ill, I felt all the time more well....


I see what happened during this period in little scenes, one
after another. I have in mind a jumble of recollections, little
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle....


... "I'm Robert Dahl. The Acme Agency sent me. You have
an opening for a company publication editor?"


"How do you do, Mr. Dahl. Why, of course, yes, we have.
But before we talk, would you mind filling out this application?"


"No. Sure. Thank you."


<i>
What a hot day it must be! How this man is sweating! His
forehead is all wet. Strange. You used to sweat. But now your
skin feels dry even in this summertime. And you feel more cold
than hot</i>....

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

... <i>Well, now, what a task to fill out this application. Your
fingers are so cramped. You grasp the pen so tightly. You can
hardly write your name. There now. How long it took! But it's
done now, anyhow. In just a moment you'll be freed of
this man. You can run now any moment. And still, when
you see Dr. Andrews tomorrow, still you'll have something to
report</i>....


"Good, Mr. Dahl, so you've got your application ready. Let's
take a look. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Now tell me about yourself."


"Well, I ... sir, it's all there on the application. That's all
there is to me. But I want you to know—I'm very much interested
in the job and I hope you think I'm qualified."


"What? Oh, sure, yes. Well now, we have some other applicants
to see. We'll let you know. Thank you very much, Mr.
Dahl, for coming in."


...<i>Strange this dryness to your skin, this chill you just felt,
talking to that man, in July. Would you freeze to death in Hell?
You know ... You know. There is a Hell. And if there is a
Hell, could there be a Heaven? Could it be? And a God in
Heaven? It could be if the one is true, the others follow. How
strange to approach God through Hell</i>.


... "Bob, we're a family. Let's do this thing together. Let's
find a compromise between Methodism and Catholicism—perhaps
the Episcopal Church. Let's find a new faith we can share
together."


"All right, honey. But there are so many different kinds.
Where do we start?"


"They say that the Reverend John Stoner of the Congregational
Church is a wonderful minister. Then there's the Unitarian
Church and the Presbyterian, besides the Episcopalian. We'll
search until we find one that suits us both. It may take a while.

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Right. O.K., honey."


... "Marilyn, it's no use. These are meeting places we've
been going to. Not churches ... not what I think of when I
think of church."


"But we've only been to three."


"But each one is just like the Catholic Church, except there's
always something missing."


"Deadwood cut away. Nothing important is gone."


"Yes, there is. The altar. They have an organ for an altar."


"You don't understand. Music is a way to worship. I love to
sing in church. When we sing together, I feel close to you in
church. I remember, I've never felt so far away from you as the
last time we went to Mass together when we were visiting your
folks."


"You could follow the Mass."


"But it's in Latin."


"You could follow it in the Missal. It's printed in both English
and Latin."


"But the priest went so fast. How could I follow anything?"


"You could pray."


"I do pray in church. But it isn't the language that bothers
me. It's Catholic doctrine. There's freedom of belief in Protestant
churches."


"Do Methodists believe in Hell?"


"Some do. Some don't. Some Methodists believe you make
your own heaven or hell on earth."


"I don't."


"I do. But that's not essential. We could still both be Methodists."


"What <i>do</i> all Methodists believe?"


"For one thing, that Christ is our personal Savior, that He

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do Methodists say the Apostle's Creed?"


"Yes, but each one has the privilege of interpreting it for
himself."


"I don't think anybody can tell for sure just what any one
Methodist does believe. Without asking him himself."


"That's about right. We have freedom to follow Christ's
teachings as we understand them."


"Marilyn, I want to go to confession."


"You can confess your sins just to God and He'll forgive
you."


"Honey, I think I'd better talk to a priest."


"Dr. Andrews, Marilyn and I have been remarried in the
Catholic Church."


"That will please your mother."


"It pleases me."


"To please your mother?"


"I did this for myself."


"Oh? How does Marilyn feel about this?"


"She wanted to find a religion we could both believe in."


"That's not necessarily a bad idea."


"But the one I wanted, she didn't, but for my sake, she allowed
herself to be married in the Catholic Church."


"Do you feel you have made Marilyn happy?"


"She says she'll be happy if only I am."


A long silence from Dr. Andrews.


"Dr. Andrews, do you believe in God?"


"What does that mean to you? What I believe is not important.
We're interested right now in you."


"But I'd like to know. Do you?"


"Many horrible things have been done by Christians in the
name of God down through the years."

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You don't believe in Him?"


"I'd rather not discuss the matter."


"Dr. Andrews, how do psychiatrists define love? As against
hate."


"There's a great deal of work being done on that subject. It
appears to some they may be closely allied."


"Have you ever read Saint Augustine?"


"Who?"


"Saint Augustine."


"No."


"He says something like, as I remember it, that God is Love
and hate is anything which is not of God. But perhaps I have
that twisted."


"Perhaps you have. But in any event, he lived a long time
ago, didn't he?"


"Yes."


"Dr. Andrews, I can't tell what you think."


"Perhaps that's what, as your doctor, I prefer."


"But how can I trust you if you won't let me know you?"


"Do I take it to mean that you don't trust me? Have you any
reason not to trust me?"


"No. No, Doctor, it's just that you're so restrained what I say
bounces back to me off you like a ball off a wall. I might be
talking to myself."


"You might be. That might be what I want."


"But, Doctor, I have placed myself in your hands and yet you
hide your hands so it crosses my mind to wonder if you hide
them because they are not clean."


"I don't believe it is necessary that I justify myself to you.
Are you questioning my ability?"


"No. It's ... it's your humanity. You seem to wish to hide
it. Why? Is there any reason why you hide it? You seem so
cold, so far away."

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I believe my relationship with my patients should be purely
a professional one. I do not wish my personality to enter into
our relationship."


"But we do have a relationship, and if it's not human I think
it must be monstrous."


"Do you wish another doctor? Perhaps you feel I can be of
no further service?"


.... That's how I felt but I was possessed with such a strange
fear of him that when he said this I didn't dare to tell him so.


I have mentioned the moment when I no longer thought of
suicide. But in the things that happened in seeming consequence
to this moment, in the various steps I took to return to Catholicism,
and in the things I did following this return, there was
still no great lifting of my spirit. I had half-believed and hoped
that this might happen after my confession. I'd heard about
such things. How a man goes into the confessional after a long
time away and how he emerges with his spirit lightened, his
mind refreshed and cleared, as burdens of guilt are lifted from
his shoulders to another's. These things do happen, I know that.
But they did not happen to me. I felt much the same way after
confession as I felt before: tense, anxious, fearful. However,
there <i>was</i> one new quality growing in me of which I was increasingly
aware. It was a resolution to do battle against myself in
a constructive, not a destructive, way.


To fight those things within me that sapped my strength, I
began to search the pages of religious books, the Bible, the Catholic
Catechism, and many others describing points of Catholic
doctrine. And, most of all, the <i>Confessions of Saint Augustine</i>.
I read and reread his confessions. How rational he was! How
true were his words! How beautiful they were! They set me on
fire as I read them. And slowly at first, but then in a rush,
thoughts of a new nature poured into me, and the things I'd
accepted before in hesitant faith, now I knew, I knew, were true!


Those stumbling blocks to me which, in my past, had been

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once, I had prided myself on this point of logic: if there
were a God He could not have created man in His own image
because man was matter and an infinite God could not be limited
by matter but must be pure spirit. Therefore, it was ridiculous
to say man was in God's image. How could there be an image
to spirit? Now, from something I read, came the answer; God's
image in man is in those qualities of man we cannot see but
know exist: love, courage, understanding. These things are not
manifestations of matter, but through matter are manifested.


In the Bible I had stumbled over Christ's statement about
people with eyes who could not see, with ears who could not
hear. Now I felt I knew what He meant. Men blinded by care
cannot see beauty. A man is deafened by his noisy mind as it
shouts for power, as it screams for revenge. Sweet music might
surround that man, but he would not hear it.


Christ had said that some people were choked by the cares and
riches of this world. Now I felt I had been so choked. Now, it
seemed, I knew just what He meant.


But I didn't. Not completely. Psyche is the Greek word for
soul. That's what I'd heard some place and as I read during
this time it seemed so wonderfully logical that they were one
and the same thing, the psyche of me, my "natural self," in which
Dr. Andrews was interested, and the soul of me, my supernatural
self, in which my confessor was interested.


I was seized by a conviction which I felt, in its truth, would
lead me to a restoration of health but which, in its falsity, only
led me to a greater sickness. I thought the splitting, the splintering
of my psyche, would be healed in that search for wholeness
that was the search for holiness. A man's separateness of personality,
of shattered heart and mind, would be, must be, healed
in his search for holiness, so I thought. How could I have been
so blinded at the very time I thought all veils were lifted from
my eyes?

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From a false premise, one false conclusion followed the other,
and finally, in wild bounds of twisted reason, I decided: Illness
of psyche is the same as evilness of soul. A man is ill because
he has been evil. If a man would grow well, he must grow good.
(These things which may be so, but are not necessarily so in any
given instance, I took as unalterable cases of cause and effect.)
<i>You have been evil and therefore you are sick, but you need
not despair because if only you try to be good, you will be
good and you will be healed. Your soul. Your psyche. The
same thing. And once you are good and you are healed, you
will be at peace both in this world and in the one to follow ...
If only Dr. Andrews knew about Saint Augustine! If only the
psychiatrist of today would search the Bible for the truth you've
found. Then he would have the tools for healing</i>.


...<i>Well, now! You will become whole by becoming holy.
You will become a saint! And in your sanctity, most certainly,
you will be a marvel of fine health in ways emotional and
mental!</i>


The next step was to seize upon the idea that the goodness of
man consists of his honest striving after good, of his honest trying.
Therefore, presto!—<i>In your knocking at the door, you
have opened the door! A man who is very good is a man near
to sanctity. Perhaps, you are nearly a saint right now! Perhaps
you</i> ARE <i>a saint right now! In the making!</i>


...<i>And, oh, now, how good you are beginning to feel and
oh, now, how good you do feel because you are good. Oh, what
a happiness it is to be good! And, oh, how happy you are becoming!</i>


<i>And how it is that as your goodness grows and your happiness
increases, your eyes are unblinded more and more and your
ears are undeafened more and more. As all resentments leave
you, all hate, all angers and all contempts, how you grow to
love yourself and your fellows and how now as this happens it
also happens that you have eyes that see and ears that hear and
more, so many things more, do these eyes see and hear, as in a
revelation, than do the eyes and ears of your poor fellows</i>.

<i>How doth wisdom pour now into your soul, your psyche, your
soul-psyche, your psyche-soul, your wholeness, your holiness.
You see God in all around you and you can feel His Goodness
outside you and in and now you speak. Or is it you speaking?
Could it not be God speaking in you? ... For men to hear!
That they, too, may know the joy you know</i>....


<i>But why now do those you love turn on you with hate as you
bend their ear to the only truth important? Why do they argue
so with you? How dare they? Is it because before they know
what you know, they must first know, as you have known, the
evil within each of us? Can't they see that it is with love that
you bid them look within themselves for evil? If only they
would cleanse themselves of evil, they would no longer suffer
the ills you see they suffer. If only they would let you help
them cleanse themselves! ... For now that you are whole and
holy, you can do this. And then would these poor foolish friends
of yours become perhaps as wise as you</i>....


<i>If Marilyn will please let you explore her psyche-soul for evil.
You will show her, your dear wife, a road to health and joy if
only she will listen patiently as you reveal to her the depths of
her evil-illness. You would ask your dear friends to gather
round, join your beloved wife, and in a rapt circle take to heart,
as you in your sweet understanding, in plain and honest speech,
spell out for them the hidden ill and wicked ways that move
them. Out of the wisdom that is yours, they will learn, dear
friends and wife, of the truth that it might set them free! ...
Free as you are free. Joyful as you are joyful. Wise as you
are wise</i>...


<i>But now, your dear friends, why do they answer your kind
words with bitterness? Don't they even know the simplest of
truths—that love them as you do, still hate breeds hate? Why
do they tempt you now to return their hate with hate? Struggle
as you may, still you feel something growing in you in response
to that which is in them which is not love. Do you cut too deep?
Is that why they feel constrained sometimes to answer you in</i>

So the madman raved. To my friends I was at first a puzzle,
then an irritation. But finally I was neither, and my frantic wife
and my pitying friends did what they could for me as kindly as
they knew how....
