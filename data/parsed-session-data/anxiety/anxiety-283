INTRODUCTION


In previous chapters we have suggested that acute psychoses
occur initially at periods of developmental impasse
as crucial growth tasks are being confronted. In
this chapter we will examine this notion in greater detail.
At least two ideas seem to be crystallizing from
much of the current clinical research dealing with psychotic
states. First is the notion that current terminology
is in great need of revision. Much of our Kraepelinian
and Bleulerian heritage has been tested and found wanting.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_772');">[note]</a><div id="_note_772" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Payne, R. &amp; Sloane, R. Can schizophrenia be defined?
<i>Dis. Nerv. System</i>, 29:113-117, 1968 (supplement).</div>
Experience suggests that current diagnostic labels
in psychosis have neither test-retest reliability nor predictive
value. Rare studies of the natural history of psychosis
demonstrate that intra-individual diagnostic variation
over a period of years can span the list of most
traditional subtypes.

Currently we are only beginning
to attempt to account for the <i>course</i> of psychotic illness
rather than to utilize static categories.


The other emerging (more properly, re-emerging) observation
is that some psychotic patients recover and go
on to progress psychologically and socially; that is, continue.
to develop as human beings. Recent workers have

The fact that some individuals who have been psychotic
may continue to grow as human beings is not a
new observation, and it is startling to recall that some
workers emphasized this fact prior to the advent of the
major somatic therapies. Sullivan, for instance, focusing
on the significance of the patient's experience of psychosis,
accounts for outcome in the following manner.


If the conservative reorganization of complexes
and sentiments, which appears to underlie a
goodly share of the early schizophrenic phenomenology,
leads the patients to a foreconscious
belief that he can circumvent or rise
above environmental handicaps, and if this belief
is the presenting feature of a comprehensive
mental integration, his recovery proceeds.
If no such reconstruction is accomplished, the
patient does not recover.

Similarly, Mayer-Gross attempted to account for the
"course of the acute psychoses" by categorizing the possible
outcomes.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3597');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3597" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">5. Mayer-Gross, W. Uber die stellungnahme zur abgelaufenen
akuten psychose. <i>Zeitschrift f√ºr die
gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie</i>, 60:160-212,

He too felt that the way in which the
psychotic episode was assimilated by the individual
played a significant role in the determination of prognosis.
The least favorable outcome he characterized by
total denial of the entire event, the most favorable by a
kind of "integration" of the experience into the ongoing

ACCOUNTS FROM PATIENTS


Many patients regard their psychotic experience in retrospect
as one which involved a struggle for growth and
maturation. We found that a significant number of our

I needed an excuse to force some sort of balance
between my bulging inner life and my timid
outer behavior ... We can be grateful that the
human soul is so constructed that it ultimately
burst concepts once held as true out of this terrible
need to live and creates the world anew
just in order to breathe in it.

A very sensitive anonymous author lists some of the
personality changes that occurred during the course of
several psychotic episodes as including loss of a chronic
premorbid anxiety, a shift from a masochistic to a non-masochistic
emotional orientation, loss of excessive dependency
on others, a greater capacity for warmth and
interest in people, a deeper sense of human equality, improvement
in sexual function, freer use of intellectual
capacities and a capacity for religious experience.

Norma McDonald (pseudonym), a recovered schizophrenic,
wrote:

Anton Boisen, perhaps more than anyone, paid attention
to the possibility of growth potential inherent
in various forms of psychosis. His ideas are all the more
relevant because of his personal involvement in the
question. He states:

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This survey of the wilderness of the lost tends
to support the hypothesis with which we
started, that many of the more serious psychoses
are essentially problem-solving experiences
which are closely related to certain types
of religious experience ... we have also discovered
that such ideas are not to be found in
all cases but only in those who are trying to
face their difficulties... We may therefore draw
the conclusion that such disturbances are not
necessarily evils but, like fever or inflammation
in the physical organism, they are attempts by
regression to lower levels of mental life to assimilate
certain hitherto unassimilated masses
of life experience. They represent the deliquescence
of the old sets and attitudes which make
possible new formations. They are essentially
purposive; in this group we even found
individuals whose lives had been changed for
the better.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9628');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9628" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9. See ref. 6, <i>Introduction</i>.</div>


We have noted in the accounts presented that individuals
often covertly communicated their growth strivings
in material written just prior to an acute psychotic episode.
Not only are patients sometimes seemingly aware
at various levels of the growth issues involved in acute
psychosis, they also experience many of the cognitive
and affective shifts which may accompany certain forms
of major personality re-orientation. Thus creative experience,
religious conversion, and other "peak experiences"
may involve much of the affective lability and
"psychedelic" form of inner experience which can accompany
the acute psychotic reaction. Psychotic experiences,
by creating upheaval at the very core of the individual,
may offer, in some instances, opportunities for

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Psychedelic and psychotomimetic phenomena
are closely related. Our hypothesis is that these
states demonstrate to varying degrees the subjective
phenomena of intrapsychic alteration,
that they are fluid states whose outcome is determined
by both intrapsychic and environmental
factors. There are clearly quantitative,
interindividual differences in the ways such experiences
can be tolerated, interpreted, terminated,
and assimilated into the ongoing context
of experiences.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11321');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11321" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6. Bowers, M. &amp; Freedman, D. "Psychedelic" experiences
in acute psychoses. <i>Arch. Gen. Psych</i>., 15:
240-248, 1966.</div>


Further, if the "psychedelic" insight frequently seen
at the onset of certain psychoses is illusory, such illusion
cannot be disqualified from forming in whole or in part
the basis of a workable illusion or vision for the future.
That is, such experience can be seen as prophetic, hopeful,
a glimpse of potentiality. There may be
<blockquote>
<p>
a relationship between pathological disillusion
and illusion and disillusion as normal
processes playing an essential part in the establishment
of external object relations and the
development of a creative relation to the
world.

Universities Press, 1965.</div>


Finally, whereas patients may see psychosis as involving
the potential achievement of growth and including
some of the cognitive and affective experiences of major
personality alteration, they also seem to regard the psychosis
itself as essentially a growth impasse, or deadlocked
struggle. Time and again this idea is expressed in

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Madness comes‚Äîa strange anesthesia
follows. A sleep akin to death, but more mysterious.
A rest from the dim regions of unconsciousness
‚Äîa state which, is neither death nor
living; lethal, mysterious‚Äîevil perhaps to
some, but only to those who do not know the
blind, intolerable horror that comes from seeing
something which cannot be borne‚Äînor
escaped.

Similarly, if acute psychosis can be seen as a growth
struggle, chronic psychosis may be viewed as an unsuccessful
struggle toward continuing development. This
view has been supported by information obtained in
amytal interviews with chronically hospitalized patients.
These individuals, often mute, under amytal seemed preoccupied
with events at the time of their initial psychotic
episode, which was often many years before.

schizophrenic patients. <i>J. Nerv. Ment. Dis</i>., 137:

Therefore, I am suggesting that the essence of the
acute psychosis is impasse and stalemate in human

ACCOUNTS FROM THERAPISTS


Thus far we have argued that, from the subjective, experiential
point of view, many psychoses have the form
and content of growth struggles which have reached an
impasse. However, not only patients but also some therapists
have noted progressive aspects of certain acute
psychotic episodes. Jackson and Watzlawick have reported
a case in which the psychosis was seen and interpreted
as a crisis in growth by the therapists involved.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_15877');">[note]</a><div id="_note_15877" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">12. Jackson, D. &amp; Watzlawick, P. The acute psychosis as
manifestation of a growth experience. <i>Psychiatric
Research Report 16</i>, 1963.</div>
Carlson has described an "acute confusional
state," sometimes seen in adolescents, as a stage in ego
development which is potentially maturational.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16192');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16192" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">13. See ref. 14, Chapter 1.</div>
Particularly
noteworthy are two cases reported by French
and Kasanin. These cases were followed with minimal
treatment for a number of years and their outcome was
characterized not only by loss of psychotic symptoms,
but by clear personality growth. Of interest is the observation
that neither case would have been predicted to do
well based on premorbid variables alone. In both cases
the authors refer to a "constructive impulse to solve the
problem of reconciling conflicting needs." Indeed, with
these two cases in mind, the authors come to the rather
remarkable conclusion that:

In attempting to estimate the probable
outcome of a psychosis, it is helpful to try to
reconstruct the problem in adaptation which
the psychosis is attempting to solve and then to
estimate the possibilities for a successful solution
in view of the actual life situation of the
patient. Such an estimate is probably more important
than the form of the psychosis as an
index of prognosis.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWTH


In one sense, the vicissitudes of human growth are
highlighted as a result of the phenomenon of psychosis.
As is so often the case, a malfunctioning system lays bare
the intricacy of inner structure and gives rise to renewed
respect for and understanding of the function of component
parts. Psychotic reactions, seen as manifestations of
impasse in a struggle for growth, point to some of the
truly rate-limiting processes in growth. Some capacities
seem to be crucial simply for growth potential to exist at all.


One of these seems to be the presence during development
of some constructive relationship between felt need
and object gratification. This basic groundwork for future
transactions between the human organism and his
object environment must be seen as essential for growth.
Prior to all other qualifying statements about object relations
lies the prerequisite that the growing human organism
seek and achieve relationships with the external
world. Rycroft puts this principle as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
It is Winnicott's contention, I believe, that
early infancy is such a critical phase and that
</p><p>[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
the importance of the early mother-infant relationship
lies not only in the amount of satisfaction
received by the infant but also in the
degree of correspondence between the infant's
latent impulses, wishes, or needs and the
mother's provision of the kind of stimuli necessary
for their release. Insofar as the mother
arouses the infant's expectations and maintains
them by a modicum of satisfaction, its
perception and conception of reality will accord
with the pattern of its inherent instinctive
tendencies, and impulses will not merely tend
to be directed toward an external reality which
is subjectively felt to be good but will actually
be developmentally bound to the images of the
reality that has released them.

By contrast, in chronic psychotic states, it could be
said of a patient
<blockquote>
<p>
That he cathected the process of thinking itself
and derived pleasure from passively watching
his intellectual processes idling in neutral ...
the thoughts which in psychical truth have become
bereft of significance come to be regarded
as precisely the only objects to have any significance.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20219');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20219" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">10. Rycroft, C. <i>Imagination and reality</i>. New York: International
Universities Press, 1965.</div>
</p>
</blockquote>
The classic papers of Jonathan Lang (pseudonym, himself
a paranoid schizophrenic) substantiate the impression
that in psychosis affectivity becomes centered
around ideation instead of external objects, thus short-circuiting
the relationship between felt need and object
gratification which is crucial for psychological growth.
White may be dealing with an aspect of this principle
when he discusses the importance of a "feeling of efficacy"
in development. He notes that "we learn about

I believe that this feeling of efficacy is one of
our most fundamental and biologically important
affects, the basis of our persisting attempts
to achieve whatever mastery we can over the
environment, the thing that lies behind our
unceasing attempts to enlarge the sphere of
our competence. It is the root of the sense of
competence that is so central in self esteem.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_21470');">[note]</a><div id="_note_21470" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">15. See ref. 14, Chapter 8.</div>


Poor direction of attention and action, poor
mastery of cognitive experience, weak assertiveness
in interpersonal relations, low feelings
of efficacy and competence, a restricted sense of
agency in leading one's life‚Äîall these crop out
in almost every aspect of the schizophrenic disorder.

To evaluate psychotic experiences with regard to evidence
of growth potential is not necessarily to be overly
optimistic about the phenomenon of psychosis. It may
allow us to be more precisely optimistic where the clinical
data warrant, however, and urge us to re-examine our
therapeutic strategies so that we foster growth whenever
possible.


GROWTH-SUPPORTING TREATMENT


We have suggested that some psychoses, when examined
from the standpoint of the existential situation and
experience of the patient, can be seen as impasses in
human growth. What are the implications of this view
for a treatment aimed at supporting the continuation of
growth? To begin with, it seems appropriate that therapists
devote at least as much time trying to understand
what the patient is trying to accomplish as they routinely
do to describing his handicaps. There is clearly inherent
in most of us a certain resistance to looking at the
adaptive capabilities of patients. This is an interesting
phenomenon in itself, but for the present discussion it is
sufficient to point to it and to urge that clinical assessment
of psychotic patients include an evaluation of
growth potential. In some instances the patient's strivings
will be relatively clear; in others they will be fragmented
and unapparent. Both Sullivan and Boisen call
attention to the fact that "catatonic" patients and others
with intense religious ideation are often most clearly
struggling (frequently at a conscious level) with growth
issues. We have noted how such conflicts may be manifest
in material patients have written. At other times,
skilled clinical assessment of the status of the patient's
relationships with important loved ones (parents, sexual

[p. <i>205</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally, there are patients, primarily those called
"hebephrenic," "process schizophrenics," or "poor premorbids,"
who may appear least understandable in
terms of the growth model presented here. Far from
being caught in a bind of progressive and retrogressive
strivings, these individuals appear peculiarly illequipped
and poorly motivated to master the minimal social
concomitants of biological maturation. Under such circumstances,
in promoting growth one may have to fall
back upon elemental processes referred to above. A therapeutic
program which offers long-term support and fosters
‚Äî even demands ‚Äî interaction with real people and
activities can prevent severe regression and foster new
social learning, slow but genuine enough.


In conclusion, prognosis in acute psychotic reactions
is likely a result of multiple influences. Premorbid social
factors and certain characteristics of the acute episode
have been shown to be important. Most studies have implied
that prognosis may be relatively predetermined
and not particularly affected by contingencies (including
treatment) related to individual assimilation of the psychotic
experience. Nevertheless, as we have attempted to
show from patient accounts, a case can be made for viewing
some psychotic episodes as essentially maturational
struggles and for viewing prognosis as, in part, related to
relative success or failure in dealing with such struggles.
Proper therapeutic assistance should take into account
the maturational strivings inherent in many psychotic
episodes.
