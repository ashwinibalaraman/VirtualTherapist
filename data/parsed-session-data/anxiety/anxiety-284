Sitting halfway up the stairs in my new flat above the flower shop,
I did something I never thought I'd do. I opened the phone book and
looked up the number of a helpline. I'd always thought they were for
those without friends, desperate teenagers living on the streets, lonely
old alcoholics. I didn't think they were for people like me, people
who were normal.


I dialled the number and a man answered.


I wasn't sure what to do next. Suddenly I didn't want to speak to
him. Perhaps if a female had answered, it would have helped. ‘What's
your name?’ he asked.


Maria? Anna? I wondered. But why bother pretending I was someone
else to him? ‘Vic,’ I said.


‘And what's the problem, Vic?’ He sounded patronising. I hesitated.
I didn't want to tell him but I needed to tell someone. ‘I want to cut
myself.’ I'd held off doing anything since the first incident, but that didn't
mean I'd lost the desire. I wanted to do it. I could visualise myself downstairs

‘Well, that's not very good, is it? Why do you want to do something
like that, Vic?’


The answer was obvious. ‘I'd feel better.’


‘So what is it that you feel bad about?’


I couldn't tell him, and instead hung up. I bit the inside of my lip
so as not to cry. I just couldn't talk about this.


The bloke I was sharing with was nice enough. His major complaint
about his last flatmate was that she watched too much TV and that
she seemed to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. I should
have taken notice of the way he said ‘seemed’. He obviously didn't
believe her.


Initially we got on pretty well. We shared meals from time to time,
went to the pub together on the odd occasion to play pool, and drank
beer on the balcony while watching the sun set over the surrounding
houses, ignoring the trucks as they went by on the road below. Rodney's
major flaws were a love of science fiction and a chip on his shoulder
caused by the way other people reacted to his love of science fiction.
They all felt he should have grown out of it. He hadn't but was in the
process of reinventing himself in other ways.


He'd moved interstate, started a new job and was trying to shed
his geek image. He now dressed like many others in Newtown pubs,
in faded Levis and funky T-shirts with messages. He wore a leather thong
around his neck, and his hair was slightly longish and tousled in a way

When I turned up to meet him, Rodney was friendly, open and very
excited about what Sydney had to offer. I needed to live somewhere,
so I played along with his enthusiasm, talking about film, and music,
and the essay I was writing on transgression. Dressed in a denim
miniskirt, Blundstone boots and a loud orange and green (long-sleeved)
shirt with stylised naked women with big hair, I looked, and sounded,
like the kind of flatmate he was after.


I was studying at art school, as after having completed an English
degree, I'd decided I wasn't ready for the workforce. It took less than
a month to work out that it was the wrong place for me. It wasn't like
doing a casual drawing course or photography course. It was serious;
the students were serious. Even when I had signed up, I'd been unsure,
so was also studying for a Master's degree in English two evenings a
week. It meant that I was very busy but I didn't see that as a problem.
I saw it as a good thing: I'd taken the previous year off and was now
ready to work hard. Besides, I didn't believe being busy could actually
do any harm.


I told Rodney about one of the first exercises we did at college.
It involved sound and performance. I sat on the floor cross-legged
in a darkened room and watched as three of my classmates stood on
a makeshift stage and made sounds with carrots. Rhythmically,
they chewed them, they chopped them and they blended them.


He laughed and decided on the spot that I'd be someone who'd be
fun to live with. I was offered the room.


At the start, I was on my best behaviour and careful not to
let him see my arm. I went to uni, wrote my essays, and worked at

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then Alex contacted me. As he'd been the one to call, not me, I felt
on surer ground. He really did want to see me. Not that either of us
had changed. The time we spent together was as stifling, stressful and
tense as it had always been.


We drank together and we slept together. Not that the latter was
much fun, due largely to the Prothiaden, the antidepressant I was still
taking. It didn't cheer me up, but did make me tired, listless, and not
at all interested in sex.


Gradually, over the next few months, things deteriorated. I found myself
staying in bed until 5 pm, only getting up so that Rodney wouldn't
know. The numbness and lethargy were almost worse than the intense
guilt I experienced as a result of not being able to function.


I moved around in a haze, finally dropping out of art school. I didn't
say goodbye to anyone and no-one had my phone number.


My doctor, who really did try to help, explained that depression,
along with affecting your mood, often meant that simple things became
difficult. I didn't believe her. Instead I was angry with myself for being
tired all the time, angry that walking up the street to do the shopping
had become a trial, angry that I couldn't drive to Canberra—
which was just three hours away—without stopping every half-hour
for a rest. I was angry that I couldn't understand things I knew I could
do. I really believed that if only I tried harder, it would all be fine.

I was still just able to write the essays I was required to do for my
Master's degree. They didn't involve new technology, or new
thoughts—which had been a real problem at art school—so I could
bluff my way through. My marks dropped off but I was still doing well
enough. The real problem now wasn't studying. It was the thoughts
of self-harm.


At first I thought I could control the fantasies but they were beginning
to take over. Sometimes I gave into them, and was then safe
while the wound healed. But I was physically healthy, so this usually
didn't take long. The images, when they came back, became worse
the longer I resisted them. I didn't just think of carving up my
arms anymore. I began to picture cutting off fingers and standing
at the mirror, slashing my face. It was at this point that I rang the
help line—and discovered that my thoughts weren't something I
could talk about, even to an anonymous stranger at the other end
of the phone.


My doctor made a booking for me with the visiting specialist who did
mental health assessments once a month at the university health centre.
My first visit to a psychiatrist was not a success. I arrived late, antagonistic
and hung-over; so hung-over that I had to dash out of the surgery
to throw up.


The psychiatrist looked at my file, looked at me, and asked a few
questions about my drinking habits and drug use. ‘Is there anything else
you want to tell me?’


I didn't like her. She was cold, dismissive and I had no desire to
tell her anything. ‘No.’

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘My advice then is to cut down on the drinking. I don't think you
need therapy. I'd suggest you keep taking the antidepressants and talk
to your doctor if necessary.’


And with that, the consultation was over.


During my next visit to my doctor, I admitted that I hadn't presented
my case very well. I hadn't told the psychiatrist anything very much:
certainly not what was worrying me. She gave me another referral. It
was someone she didn't know personally, but she said to let her know
if there were any problems.


Two weeks later, I caught the train out to Bondi Junction. His office
was on the tenth floor, looking back towards the city. It could have been
that of an accountant. The furniture looked as though it had been picked
up at a government auction and there were few books. I immediately
felt uneasy.


First of all he asked me questions about my age, education, family
and general health. He then asked me to describe my symptoms.


‘Right,’ he said. ‘I'd like you to do a few tests to determine what your
short-term memory is like and how your general cognitive abilities are.’


After that, I told him about my desire to hurt myself—including
the more recent graphic images—and he handed me a pamphlet. ‘Read
this carefully, and we can talk about it when you see me next week.
I don't believe it's depression you're suffering from. It might be a form
of schizophrenia though. You can make an appointment with my receptionist.’
He stood up, which was apparently my signal to leave.


I was shaking on the way home as I read the pamphlet, appalled and
terrified. All I knew about schizophrenia was that it was associated

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I couldn't believe it.


I told Alex that night. He didn't believe it either. ‘The man's a fucking
dickhead. Don't go back to him. You're not schizophrenic—but you're
certainly not well. Find someone who can treat you properly.’
