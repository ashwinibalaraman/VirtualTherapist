“Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br />
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;<br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
And waste its sweetness in the desert air.”


--GRAY'S ELEGY.


A great interest was elicited by the patients in the “Asylum,”
by the sudden death of the highly respected Mr. Wells,
and many were the prayers that ascended for his deeply afflicted
family. Much sorrow was expressed that his wife
was not sent for when he so much wished to see her. Some
thanked God that our fellow sufferer was now free;--where

If my limits allowed, I should like to describe many of the
ladies there, but this is impossible. They have drawn bright
and ever enduring pictures upon my mind,--pictures of virtues
rarely equalled,--never surpassed. Such industry, such
long suffering patience, such forgiveness of injuries--so inflexible
a regard for truth and honor I never saw outside
that Institution. I will name but two examples in this hall,
and I distinguish these from the rest, on account of their
having suffered there so long.


Mrs. Maria Chapman was a lady of unparalleled industry,
and great refinement and dignity of character. She was a
pattern of neatness and good order. It was truly refreshing
to visit her room, of which she took the whole care. Never
unemployed a moment, her ever busy fingers were always
engaged with book, needle or pen. She commands universal
respect. She has been there more than six years. I wished
to know why this estimable and highly intelligent lady is excluded
from society. I asked her attendants in what her
insanity consisted, but found them as uninformed as myself
upon the subject, though she had been in this ward all the
time. I believe however the crime for which she has lost
her sacred liberty, is that of being a Swedenborgian! This
I presume is ranked among the “popular delusions” to which
Dr. McFarland refers in his most edifying “Seventh Biennial
Report.” But I only wish the sapient Doctor was as
popularly deluded as she is, and then perhaps he might follow
some of her good examples so nobly set before him in
her lonely captivity.


Of Mrs. Minard, of St. Charles, I could give a description
very similar to that of the amiable Mrs. Chapman.
Mrs. Minard also was remarkable for her never ceasing industry,
and for the truly elegant appearance, not only of b(...)

If all Spiritualists must be confined in “Lunatic Asylums,”
we shall soon want Uncle Sam to give us an unlimited quantity
of Government land upon which to erect them! Poor
Mrs. Minard! my heart has ached for that lovely woman
many times, as I beheld her placid countenance, and the
premature marks of age upon her head, which grief, not years
had caused, as day by day I witnessed her cheerful piety,
her long suffering patience, and exemplary fortitude, I wished
that many who enjoy all the blessings of which she is so unjustly
deprived, could witness the same. I once asked her
when she expected to go to the home of which she had often
very freely spoken to me. “When the right Spiritual governs
Dr. McFarland,” she replied. “But you seem very
cheerful and even happy,” I once ventured to say to her, as
by her permission I had been examining her house-plants
which she tended with daily care. “No,” replied she, “do
not imagine it; I am not happy, though I may seem cheerful.
I am thinking of my family at St. Charles, and of my
long separation from them. I have about concluded I shall
never be permitted to go home. As for happiness, while in
these circumstances, it is out of the question.” Yet she,
--and I found the same true of Mrs. Chapman and several
other ladies--is so strictly conscientious, so fastidiously honorable,
that they will use no clandestine measures to get
away.


They are wearing out their precious lives, waiting for their
doors to be legally opened--in short, as some of them express
it, waiting for “the right spirits to reign,” and when “the

But it is time that I relate how I came to leave this the
best, and by far the most highly privileged of all the wards
in the Institution.


I had become very unhappy in consequence of my ever increasing
anxiety about my husband. He had told me, previous
to my leaving him, that he never could be happy till
my return. I had as yet, received but one letter from him,
and he said nothing about how he was prospering in all the
details of our home life, in which I had so long been his only
companion. In his letter he earnestly exhorted me to “put
no trust in man,” (this was sensible, for how can a wife trust
in any man, when her own husband has forfeited her trust?)
but to “trust in God,” and “pray daily for the happy mo
ment of our reunion.” But that “reunion” was indefinitely
protracted, and with no visible reason. What was I now
waiting for? To “be cured!” Cured of what? My opinions,
my affections, my mental proclivities and peculiarities
were without exception, the same as they had been, allowance
being made for the change in external circumstances.
My executive faculties were suffering no impediment, save
that of locks and keys, to their healthy normal action. All
my time was industriously devoted to vigorous employment
of some kind, except when confined to my bed by illness.


After my declining to assist in the work-room was reported
to Mrs. McFarland, the matron, she steadily refused to let
me have any facilities (except a small quantity of yarn) with
which to work for myself. Then the ladies of the ward
(patients “insane” of course) knowing this, gave me many
little pieces of their own garments, also needle and thread,
with which to busy myself for amusement as I thought proper.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Time passed on, and I could in this ward have been comparatively
contented for a time, if my letters had not been
intercepted, and if I could have slept at night. The Fifth
and Sixth wards, immediately below the Seventh, were occupied
by the noisy and furious, and the screaming and raving
of such at night were so plainly heard from the open windows,
as to put quiet sleep out of the question.


From this I suffered so much inconvenience, that at last,
I mentioned it to the assistant, Dr. Tenny. He offered
very kindly to make a change of the patient in the Sixth
ward, whose room was directly below mine, and to put her
in another part of the hall, and a quiet person in her place.
Reflecting a moment, I sincerely thanked Dr. Tenny, for his
proposed kindness, but decidedly objected. “There may be
other patients in that hall, even more feeble than myself.
If you remove the noisy one who keeps me awake, nearer to
their rooms, she may be liable to injure them in the same
way. Now as I came here voluntarily, I ought bravely to face
the effects of my own action, and with your permission, will
persevere in doing it.” This did not quite satisfy the Doctor,
who urged in reply the duty devolving on me as a Christian
to take the best possible care of my health, thus acting in
concert with the best arrangements he was able to make for
my comfort. Dr. Tenny further urged that since this arrangement
was proposed by himself and not by me, if it did
injure the other patients, the fault would not be mine. But

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a few days however, I began to think the reasonings of
Dr. Tenny were better than my own. I had become so much
enfeebled by want of sleep, that my health sunk rapidly.
Violent and frequent headaches distresed me daily, and, as
so much was going on all the time in the hall among so many,
I could neither sleep, except a very little, either day or
night. One night, after about three hour's sleep, I was
awakened by a violent noise below. A voice directly under
my open window, screamed out in tones of thunder--
“God d--n McFarland's soul to hell!” This was several
times repeated with terrific emphasis, with many similar
expressions.


The day after, I was again visited by my friend Dr. Tenny.
Observing the unusual paleness of my face, he kindly inquired
for its cause. I told him with much reluctance, that
I was now convinced of the propriety of some change, but
could not bear to increase in any possible way the sufferings
of the other patients. I wished him to give me some very
powerful soporific to compel sleep even in the terrible noise.
He declined doing this. Then he called and consulted one
of my attendants; the result was an arrangement for me to
sleep in the dormitory, and try the result of such a change.
The dormitory was small but had several beds in it. But as
all who slept there were perfectly harmless in the daytime,
I did not fear being locked up with them at night. I retired,
and congratulated myself that Dr. Tenny's plan for my rest
was the best that could be devised. I looked upon the pale
quiet sleepers around me, and then fearlessly attempted for
the first time in my life, to sleep locked up in a room with
those the world calls “dangerous” and “unfit for society.”
But I had made a mistake in supposing rest possible there.
In the middle of the night, one of the patients arose from

I now had a better opportunity to sleep than before. Yet
as day by day, I still heard nothing from my friends, my natural
supposition was that some great calamity had occurred
to them. I feared the worst, and did not restrain the expression
of these fears. Nor could I possibly solve the mystery
of my being detained under such circumstances, I wished
to know how my supposed insanity manifested itself to others;
and respectfully questioned both my attendants, in reference
to this matter.

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To the credit of these ladies, I will say that they both
frankly and honestly confessed that, as yet, they had seen
nothing in my appearance indicating insanity, or that was
not both ladylike and kind. The names of these ladies were,
Miss McElvie, and Miss Johnston. I was in the ward with
them, in all, about four months, and I never found any fault
with them, nor they with me, to my knowledge. On the occasion
I now refer to, these ladies added to the testimony
above alluded to, that I had always complied readily with
their wishes, and given them no trouble. They further
added that the business of deciding the sanity of the patients
did not belong to them, and therefore politely begged of me
not to apply to them for any information or assistance, that
from their position, they had no power to give me. I felt
grateful for so polite and frank an avowal of their feelings,
and resolved more than ever, to treat them, as I had ever
done, with deferential attention to their wishes.


I wish here to say something respecting Mr. Jones, the
Superintendent of the farm. The same honest avowal was
made by that gentleman, as by these attendants. Mr. Jones
frequently took the patients to ride, when they wore permitted
that luxury. He was always present at the balls,
and often had occasion to come into our hall on errands. It
was on these occasions that I became acquainted with him.
He seemed to be much respected, indeed a general favorite in
the “Asylum.” Having had, on the occasions I have named,
many interviews and brief conversations with him, I once
ventured to ask him, if he had ever seen or suspected any
insanity in me, or any irregularity or impropriety of deportment.
He declared unhesitatingly, “No, I never have,
Mrs. Olsen.” On learning from me, that none of my friends
had ever visited me, he expressed his conviction that if they
were to see me as he saw me, they would have me removed
without delay. I then asked him if he should feel free to express
that opinion, if he knew that Dr. McFarland would
know it? He replied, in substance, “I am, indeed, in the
employ of Dr. McFarland as an overseer of the “Asylum”

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now as I daily saw to my unspeakable regret, and disappoinment,
that my communications were entirely intercepted
from the outside world; and that no one could be found, who
either could or would explain to me why this was done; also
when my garments, one after another, were literally robbed
or stolen by some of the numerous servants through whose
hands they were allowed to pass--and that my health was
greatly suffering, and moreover when I saw that all attempts
I made by respectful remonstrance, for the alleviation
of these disagreable conditions, were not of the least
avail, as the Doctor often would not take the least notice of
what I said--when a certainty of these things was forced
upon me, I lost all confidence in his honor, his fidelity, and in
his word! From that time, I ceased making any requests of
him, as himself had thus taught me to do. He saw the change
in my deportment, and though I continued coolly civil, when
he deigned to notice me, there were no longer on my countenance
my former indications of confidence in himself. He
did not evidently intend to be “conquered by a woman.”
And I may add that this redoubtable M. D. was not “conquered
by a woman,” and probably never will be; but I will
venture the prediction that before he arrives to the end of
his race, he will find himself both conquered and sadly
whipped,--not by a woman, nor by a “conspiracy of women,”
but by Dr. Andrew McFarland himself.
