<font size="4"><b>Heart Disease: Anger, Depression, and Anxiety</b></font>

EPIDEMIOLOGY


It has long been assumed that the emotional distress
(depression/anxiety/irritability) commonly
observed in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients is
a "natural" reaction to the diagnosis. This is an erroneous,
harmful, and expensive assumption. It is now
clear that, for large numbers of patients, emotional
distress predates and predicts the onset of CHD. For
those who do not have premorbid emotional distress,
reactive depression/anxiety (and anger) will still
adversely affect the progression of atherosclerosis,
ischemic episodes, myocardial infarction (MI)/death,
noncompliance, symptoms, and utilization.


Major depression occurs in 18% to 20% of CHD
patients (a fivefold increase over general population
levels), and "minor" depression (dysthymia or adjustment
disorder with depressed mood) occurs in another
10% to 15% (also a fivefold increase over general
population levels). The distinction between major (per
<i>DSM-IV</i> criteria) and minor depression (Beck scores
of 10 or greater) has not been found to be useful

Noncardiac chest pain may occur in up to 50% of
CHD patients, betokening widespread panic-like
events. Beitman has, in fact, proposed the term "nonfear
panic attacks" to describe those events where
patients have many of the physical symptoms of panic
but deny subjective anxiety/fear. Anger, depression,
and anxiety are very strong predictors of morbidity/mortality,
with risk ratios often larger than those
observed for traditional risk factors such as hypercho-lesterolemia,
hypertension, and smoking. Other out-comes
of clinical interest have also been found to be
affected by, or associated with, one or more of these
three emotions. These include chest pain, coronary
artery disease (CAD), fatigue, utilization, hypertension,
and noncompliance with smoking cessation, diabetic,
and exercise regimens.


MECHANISMS


Emotional distress may affect the development and
aggravation of CHD via psychophysiological or psychobehavioral
pathways. These pathways are not
mutually exclusive, and there is, at present, no reason
to assume that one pathway is the sole culprit. In fact,
available evidence suggests that each pathway is plausible.
The behaviorally mediated pathways are so well
established that they require little discussion.
Evidence is available demonstrating that emotional
distress (particularly anger and depression) is a predictor
of failure to stop smoking, and both cognitivebehavioral
therapy and psychopharmac otherapy
increase cessation/maintenance rates. Compliance to
pill taking, diabetic regimens, and exercise has also
been found to be influenced adversely by emotional
distress, although no intervention trials have yet
demonstrated improvement results from treatment.


The psychophysiological pathways are also multiple
and not mutually exclusive. The acute induction of
ischemia by acute mental stress in patients with
documented CAD is well established. These observations
are complemented by the increase in sudden
death seen during natural experiments such as earthquakes
and bombings. These psychologically induced
events may be due to induced vasoconstriction, vasomotoric-induced
plaque rupture, and/or enhanced platelet
aggregability superimposed on a plaque.


Distress-related immunocompetance may be
impaired as a result of depression, leading to chronic
smoldering infection, and/or chronic, subclinical
inflammation may promote plaque growth and/or
instability.


The acute induction of ischemia may also help
account for the increased chest pain seen in patients
with emotional distress (particularly anxiety and
depression) and the reduction of chest pain associated
with treatment of emotional distress. On the other
hand, diminished beta endorphins associated with
anxiety and depression may simply make patients
hypersensitive to ischemic events.


DIAGNOSIS


As Appels and others have shown, emotional distress
in CHD patients often manifests as "fatigue" or
"vital exhaustion" (prolonged sleep onset or nocturnal
awakening, chronic tiredness, and/or irritability)
rather than classic depression. Because these symptoms
are almost always misconstrued as a result of the
CHD rather than primary psychological phenomena,
they result in more aggressive cardiac treatment rather
than referral for psychosocial or psychopharmacological
intervention. For example, depression has been
found to strongly contaminate New York Heart
Association (NYHA) ratings in heart failure.


Screening of CHD patients should take place at the
time of initial diagnosis and then periodically as suspected
by noncompliance, resting chest pain, chronic
difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening
tired, and chronic fatigue. We recommend the use
of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) completed by the patient because of its
brevity, innocuous content, and easy scoring. Because
cardiac patients (particularly males) are prone to
denial of emotional distress, self-report alone is inadequate
in screening patients. Spouse/friend ratings
have been found to be superior to self-report at correlating
with CAD severity, age at initial diagnosis.
and chest pain at 5-year follow-up. Furthermore,

[p. <i>500</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284044-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first task in diagnosis and treatment is to rule
out organic causes of "depression." In CHD populations,
this means screening for common comorbid
conditions such as sleep apnea, cocaine abuse, and
dementia. Because these conditions cause, or mimic,
some of the symptoms of depression, they are often
misconstrued by patients, families, and physicians
alike. Assuming these conditions have been ruled out,
several other considerations are important.


Depression is, more often than not, comorbid with
elevations in anger/hostility ("irritability") and/or
anxiety (panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder
[GAD], or "worry"). In every single-sample test of the
uniqueness or confounding of the negative emotions
as predictors of clinical status or outcomes of which
we are aware, only one measure emerges as necessary
to capture all relevant variance in the outcome variable.
Thus, screening for multiple measures is almost
certainly unnecessary and, from a cost-effectiveness
standpoint, wasteful. As in most medical populations,
formal <i>DSM-IV</i> criteria are rarely useful. Most cardiac
patients present with atypical depression/anxiety
manifested as chest pain, disturbed sleep, fatigue, or
irritability rather than the usual symptoms of sad
mood, crying, hopelessness, guilt, or suicidality. This
is most likely due to denial or minimization, as discussed
below.


TREATMENT


Treatment of emotional distress has been found to
decrease MI and death, chest pain, continued smoking
or relapse, ischemic episodes, and utilization.
Although not yet tested in intervention trials, there is
reason to believe that treatment will improve compliance
to pill taking, diabetic regimens, and exercise.


Obviously, the presence of cocaine abuse or sleep
apnea requires referral for treatment focused on these
conditions. For drug abuse, it is rarely helpful to
attempt treatment of emotional distress before
abstinence is achieved, since much of the patient's emotionality
is attributable to fluctuating levels of psychoactives
in the central nervous system (CNS) and will
only confuse the cognitive-behavioral treatment. For
sleep apnea, idiosyncratic drug reactions can occur.


Exercise is known to reduce both cardiac events
and emotional distress. Any patient not already
engaged in a regular exercise program should be considered
for cardiac rehabilitation.


At the present time, cognitive-behavioral stress
management is the best established means of improving
cardiac outcomes. Risk reductions for MI and death
average about 34%. The use of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is relatively new, but
well established as safe. Because the older tricyclic
antidepressants caused various anticholinergic side
effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, orthostatic hypotension,
and lengthening of the QT), clinicians have
generally shied away from their use in cardiac populations.
More important, the newer SSRIs not only
have none of these concerns but have shown exceptional
promise in reducing cardiac events. In a casecontrol
comparison, Sauer et al. found MI rates to be
reduced by 55% to 65%. This is the same magnitude
risk reduction observed for coronary artery bypass
surgery in left main CAD. In a small safety and efficacy
trial of sertraline (Zoloft), originally unintended
to measure cardiac outcomes, these findings appear to
be supported. Because of drug-drug interactions for
many of the SSRIs, the preferred agents are sertraline
(Zoloft) and citalopram (Celexa). Generally low doses
(25-50 mg of Zoloft or 10-20 mg of Celexa) are
adequate.


In two large trials of cognitive-behavioral treatment,
women experienced adverse outcomes as a
result of treatment. It may be that sex-specific cognitive-behavioral
treatment will prove necessary. But the
benefits of SSRIs need to be studied for females.
