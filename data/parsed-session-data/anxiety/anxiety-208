BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: Session 3.
CLIENT: It's very hard to come inside with the weather so nice.
COUNSELOR: Oh, it sure is.
CLIENT: Too bad there's no plug outside for your tape recorder.
COUNSELOR: That's right.
CLIENT: I think I got something figured out.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: Or at least, well, something starts to make sense. Well, I don't know (inaudible at 0:00:24.1). The whole thing, I think, boils down - well, before I say this, first I should mention that this is - it's really working, the idea is to keep me thinking about it because I - since my last time here, I was spending most of my idle moments trying to straighten things out. And I came up with this. A lot of it boils down to basically being dishonest. And now, I mean, it all - since that word.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Of course, the obvious thing is - the thing that I'm worried about is being dishonest in my personal relationships. But also, if you remember, I said that I get caught in little white lies all the time and exaggerations.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And those things are just things, inconsequential things in my personal life. [0:01:15.9]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Now if you just project that a little bit farther, if I lie to other people, I probably lie to myself. And if that's the case, then I might have self-contradictory things that, you know, I might think something motivates me, but because I lied to myself for so long it wouldn't. And that was, then explain what I said once that I might be contradicting myself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I see, that would explain why that might very well happen.
CLIENT: Yeah, so it could just well boil down that I have a habit of lying to other people, and just because of that I lie to myself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And now, with some fear of, you know, saying, well, that's it and then analyzing everything on that basis.
COUNSELOR: But you want to try it out?
CLIENT: Yeah, well, yeah. When those people came over the other night I think I probably sort of knew that, and decided I wasn't going to lie, so I just didn't emote at all and just sort of crawled inside a shell. Some sort of fear of falling back into the same rut.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That seems to make sense to me.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And also, certainly about the sex problem and certainly about a lot of other things, this is the first time I've been honest with someone else, you know, right across the board.
COUNSELOR: Yes.
CLIENT: Because when I first decided to come in here, I decided it wasn't going to work unless I was. [0:02:46.6]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I said, well, you take care of this problem in my life and we'll single this one out and I'll let you talk about it, but we're not going to talk about anything else. Well, you can't do that. So I decided when I first decided to come in here that I had to do it a hundred percent honestly. And I probably haven't done that before because - anyone you get to know, at first you build up some barrier.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, a barrier that keeps you from being honest.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I think that - oh, then too there's also the dream. You see, I'm a little bit afraid. And the thing I'm afraid about is that I'm not used to being honest. And - it's clear to me now that you were performing a lobotomy on me.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I was running away from you.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So that's the major insight since Monday.
COUNSELOR: I see, I see. And you mean about the dream, you mean it really is true that you're afraid of what's going to happen if you really are honest?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's right. And now I'm wondering if - you see, I have this concept that it's a lobotomy, that it's going to end up bad, that I'm going to end up being a vegetable.
COUNSELOR: The therapy is going to do something to you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Being honest.
CLIENT: Well, it clearly won't - hopefully, I won't be the same, that's the whole point. I don't want to be the same because I dislike the way I am at times very much.
COUNSELOR: But you don't want to be something worse either?
CLIENT: I don't know if it's a fear of being something worse. Yeah, it probably is.
COUNSELOR: What's the vegetable kind of thing (inaudible at 0:04:47.1)?
CLIENT: Oh, that's - no, the vegetable thing, that doesn't fit in at all I don't think. That just is the result - if I'm not mistaken, I know very little about a lobotomy.
COUNSELOR: I see, I see. [0:04:59.2]
CLIENT: That's just - I think the most severe - it's probably - if you had to come up with something very severe that someone would do to one's mind, you would say, ah, a lobotomy.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: I think it's the severity rather than what a lobotomy (inaudible at 0:05:12.5).
COUNSELOR: I see, I see.
CLIENT: What therapy would do.
COUNSELOR: It's like the seriousness of what therapy might do to you?
CLIENT: Yeah - I.
COUNSELOR: But can you focus on what it is that might happen to you from therapy?
CLIENT: Well, that's hard, that's really hard. Before I say what it is, I'll say what I hope it could be.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: I hope it will ultimately end up with just me being myself and therefore, on my merits rather than how good I am at acting. And having that (inaudible at 0:05:56.7) my relationship with (inaudible at 0:05:57.1).
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: How people look at me. Why should I be afraid of that, though? That doesn't make any sense. I don't think I'm afraid of that as much as I'm afraid of the - when I say this it's not like, you know, it's not perfectly clear, it's something that's way back there in my head. It's probably a fear of being on different grounds, you know? Of being completely frank.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And it wouldn't feel safe.
COUNSELOR: You mean in the sense that it's very unfamiliar or...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You know...
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know (inaudible at 0:06:47.4). It's strange. I'm really beginning to respect the method, though. As I said when I started, it gets one to think. And as - well, it's like anything. If I'm going to be a teacher someday and I know that I'm going to have, you know, daily assignments that will keep people up on their work. And I mean, the thing that a therapist does, apparently, from the little I've seen of it is to get someone to think about himself. And just the fact that I'm going to come back here and talk for another hour, that, you know...
COUNSELOR: Keeps you thinking.
CLIENT: Yeah, it keeps you active in (inaudible at 0:07:26.4). If I fail the test I'll blame it on you for wasting all my time. Not wasting it.
COUNSELOR: You mean, if therapy doesn't work?
CLIENT: No, no, no, I'm talking about I have to study.
COUNSELOR: Oh, oh, oh, I see, I see.
CLIENT: Now I have a scapegoat. Maybe I'll feel good about failing. That's another thing maybe I should mention too by the way. I don't know if it makes any sense to you about throwing the physics books into the woods, if you remember that?
COUNSELOR: I do remember. [0:08:01.7]
CLIENT: I don't know if I really belong in physics.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: In more ways than one I'm a product of the 20th Century. I am - well, I'm a war baby; I was born in the war boom. And I'm a (inaudible at 0:08:16.8) scientist. You know, in the big scare of the late 50s all the high school kids got scared into going into natural sciences. And how it looks like in a few years I'm going to be technologically unemployed because of the pollution thing. (Inaudible at 0:08:35.0), I mean, you know, scientists are really looked down upon now, and it's hard to find jobs, especially for scientists.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:08:41.2) anyone (ph). And one of the reasons is that technology is blamed for many of our problems. But anyhow - so I was sort of turned into physics without much thought. Of course, I've heard people with less thought. I mean, one of my professors was a physicist because when he was a freshman his first year, it was the shortest line in registration.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: There never was any real motivation. I mean, it just seemed sort of a drift more than a drive (ph).
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. You just found yourself wandering?
CLIENT: Yeah, and it got [around me] (ph) in my senior year, and there I was with a physics major and the logical thing to do - I mean, there was no thought about not going to graduate school. I was simply (ph) going to go to graduate school.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So, then when I got here it became a hundred percent physics. I went to a liberal arts school.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And when I got here, wow - I mean, all these other kids knew physics and I didn't. And it's taken me a couple of years to catch up, although I'm pretty much caught up now. And I haven't enjoyed it really. [0:09:50.0]
COUNSELOR: You haven't?
CLIENT: No, I enjoyed the first four years because it was basically because I was getting a liberal education, physics was just the thing I happened to take a little more of.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, like I spent a year in Europe and I was goofing around, and interested in student' activities. But this idea of - that I've been doing (ph) the last two years...
COUNSELOR: Focusing your whole life on.
CLIENT: Yeah, I suppose it will be all right once I get out because I hope to, you know, teach in a small college where I can again get back and worry about things besides the - you know, I can worry about how a student is growing and learning, rather than just the physics material itself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But I really - I think I missed my calling, I don't know where else it would be. I don't have any idea what else it would be.
COUNSELOR: But you don't (inaudible at 0:10:35.8) like a burning interest in physics (inaudible at 0:10:38.1)?
CLIENT: No, the thing that's driving me more than anything is the fear of failure I think.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Once I got here.
COUNSELOR: Isn't a fear of not being able to (inaudible at 0:10:49.7)?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's probably other people's standards too. I'm pretty sure it is as a matter of fact. And I'm real studying scared is what it boils down to. I just have this thing, you know, that I've got to learn this stuff. I have to learn it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Every now and then I'll run into something that will fire me up. But more than that, get through Chapter 17 by Tuesday.
COUNSELOR: It's a fear of if you don't you're going to mess up on the test?
CLIENT: Yeah, and mess up with the whole degree thing.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Things work out well, maybe I'll fail the test and go into psychology here and become a therapist. I don't know (ph).
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:11:35.2).
CLIENT: Seems like it would be interesting.
COUNSELOR: And that's something that you...
CLIENT: No, I'm just...
COUNSELOR: You're kidding, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I see.
CLIENT: I don't know, it seems like I'm enjoying this much more than enjoying studying, though, but then again, it's just me. [0:11:52.4]
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Well, which brings me to another thing, I have another fear (inaudible at 0:11:58.3), I'm really wasting your time.
COUNSELOR: That you're wasting me time?
CLIENT: Yeah, because I - when you think about someone in therapy, you think about someone, you know, real - someone that if he isn't take care of by, you know, next week he'll be killing himself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Or would just be a - completely drop out of society. I'm sure I'll get along, you know?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And for that reason, I don't know that - you know, I just don't feel right about it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, don't feel right about having me spend my time with you when I could be spending it with somebody who's really worse off?
CLIENT: Yeah, but yet, then there's another emotion counteracting that. And that's the idea that for me it is my problem.
COUNSELOR: I'm not quite sure.
CLIENT: Well, (inaudible at 0:12:57.2). A good analogy, the thought - one time a (inaudible at 0:13:03.9), what was his name? He was asked (ph) in a magazine article, who was it? It doesn't matter who it was. He was asked that if he were given the opportunity, if he could kill one person and by killing that person, there would be no more people ever killed, his answer was, "Of course not because I've killed everything by killing one person."
See, for that one person you've killed all the trees and life and air everything. But that person - you've done it for him completely. [0:13:31.2]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So therefore, even you've saved - might have saved, you know, countless others, for that one person it's everything.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I see, for you it means everything?
CLIENT: Yeah, for me it's the major problem confronting me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: And fortunately, you know, most people don't have the severe problems where they'll end up being - you know, the major points in their life were, if they don't have therapy it will just be catastrophic.
COUNSELOR: Are you saying you are like that or...
CLIENT: No, no, no.
COUNSELOR: You're not like - I see.
CLIENT: I'd plug along. I don't think I'd be very happy.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And this - the problem...
COUNSELOR: Well, just let me say, I don't feel like I'm wasting my time as far as how I feel.
CLIENT: I knew that, I did.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
CLIENT: And I knew you would say that.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: But I still feel that way.
COUNSELOR: But you still feel that way?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: No, I can tell that you wouldn't feel that way at all. But yet, there's something in me that says (inaudible at 0:14:39.9).
COUNSELOR: I mean, I wouldn't do it if I felt that way.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but there's - yeah, I see, there's still something in you that says, it's like, do I have the right to take the place or take the time of other people that need it more?
CLIENT: Yeah. And - well, yeah. I also - with - oh, (inaudible at 0:15:13.6) fit in? Let's see, there's something else I thought of in the shower this morning (inaudible at 0:15:20.5). Oh, yeah, the continual references to the tape recorder that I've made.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It's sort of - the confusion of all the lies in my life will be straightened out merely by - first of all, merely by just having them down. I mean, and it's not necessarily the fact that, all right, we're going to write down statement one and (inaudible at 0:15:47.5) keep going after statement 739. Rather the idea in my head that now, you know, I've said what I feel about certain things. And it's down, it's recorded.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:15:58.9]
CLIENT: That should bring all the lies out in a different way than if it weren't recorded. Just something I feel about that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Tell me about...
CLIENT: It's probably the organizational thing (inaudible at 0:16:12.5), you know?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Once it's down it has more weight than if it were just forgot.
COUNSELOR: Oh, I see, it's made some kind of a mark (inaudible at 0:16:22.8).
CLIENT: Yeah, so - well, it's sort of out and it's permanently recorded so that it could - if we wanted to we could sit down and ideally, if we found out why I feel the way I do, why I act the way I do, this piece would fit into the puzzle. We'd have the piece there.
COUNSELOR: Right, I see, the piece would be there to use.
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's a comfortable feeling.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: Because the more I talk, the more confused I get sometimes.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And this seems to make me feel confused and (inaudible at 0:17:03.4) the end product.
COUNSELOR: I see, it's like if you can get it out, even though it's confusing, you'll have it all laid out and then (inaudible at 0:17:12.5).
CLIENT: Yeah, just by putting gin enough time.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:17:17.8]
CLIENT: I don't know what (ph) - my - I suppose I should mention this. Yeah, I (inaudible at 0:17:36.4) my parents favorite child basically because I've lied. I don't know if I said that or not.
COUNSELOR: I think you did say it.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, my sister-in-law - my sister and my brother-in-law had a falling out with my parents a couple of years ago that really got violent. And subsequently, my sister had her first baby. And now they're coming back together again because they're grandparents, and they're really turned on by that. And I don't know if she's lying more now or just not talking about the things that matter to her. Politically they're just (inaudible at 0:18:17.7) any political argument ends up in violence, shouting match.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I'm, if anything, more left than my sister and I just don't talk about it or lie a little.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So that they don't know how I feel. Only rare occasions have I ever had any real political discussions. But...
COUNSELOR: But you're not sure how she's handling it?
CLIENT: Yeah, I'd really be interested. This is - I don't know if it fits into me or not, but this is something that's crossed my mind lately. They just went up - they just drove out (inaudible at 0:18:51.0) now, yesterday. And that - two years ago I thought they would never see each other again.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Which is a real change, I'd be interested in seeing. I don't know if I also mentioned, might as well bring my sister in because it matters. See, I didn't go through school myself. I went through school with my sisters and brother.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And - did I mention that before?
COUNSELOR: Yes.
CLIENT: Yeah, and that was really a force to meet up to what she did.
COUNSELOR: You really felt that, yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: Because she Miss Everything, you know?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You were Miss Everything's little brother?
CLIENT: Yeah, so I was really forced into meeting those expectations.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I developed an ulcer when I was 12 just on the pressure of that alone. You know, I was really - I was a very nervous sort. And - but not outwardly so. I don't think anyone really knew I was nervous. My mother said it couldn't be an ulcer because he's not nervous. [0:19:56.6]
COUNSELOR: It was all inside?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, and there was a time, like, I was on milk and cream for two years. I mean, I was really sick and it was a real physiological thing.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think it was (inaudible at 0:20:06.7) just by this - all done just because of this pressure to do as well as she.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And then I went away to college. I didn't go to the same college she went to. I could have gone just anonymously. I mean, without any expectations at all of - without anyone expecting anything of me.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And yet, when I went there through many means, eventually people expected great things of me. You know, I was expected to be great swimming champion and to be a phi bate and to do all these great things.
COUNSELOR: And somehow the same kind of thing happened.
CLIENT: It had to be me that did it. I mean, I had to tell everyone that I was going to end up that way.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I wonder if I just needed that. You know, I had to have a sister replacement.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I probably did.
COUNSELOR: And you wonder if there - got to be something comfortable about acting that way.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Then it was hard to give up even though you could have.
CLIENT: Um-hmm. When I came here it was a complete change. Of course, when I came here it was a different world because everyone here was a good physicist and I wasn't.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So there was no way I was going to have any great expectations to realize I guess. And I saw that early.
COUNSELOR: It's a different kind of situation? [0:21:55.3]
CLIENT: Yeah, but basically no hope of excelling.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It wouldn't have worked?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Try that (inaudible at 0:22:01.6).
CLIENT: Or maybe I changed a lot. The major metamorphoses, I mean outward, people just saw me or talked to me about my beliefs occurred about two years ago, three years ago.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And maybe that was another one of the changes, I don't know.
COUNSELOR: It's, like, you're not sure whether that didn't happen here because of you or because of the situation (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, although - no, that's not right, that's not right because it was that same year, 1968 when I - no basis in the world, I decided I was going to swim the Channel.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I just told people I was. There was no way in the world at the time I had any right of saying that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's right. As a matter of fact, one of the people that knows me fairly well is June, and I might as well name a few people (inaudible at 0:22:59.8). And one time she told me, she said - we were talking about the swim and she said, "You know why you did it?" And I said, "No, I haven't really been able to figure out why I swam it." She said, "Well, it's clear, you did it because you told someone you were going to do it."
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And the more I thought about that, the more I said, sure, that's right. [0:23:20.5]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So now maybe, when I got here I needed something else I could excel in. I needed another sister ahead of me. That's really sad, you know, that rather than having excellence or just competence in something - the motivating force, driving one that one has to make someone else expect something of you and then realize that expectation.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. It's sad that you can't be free of (inaudible at 0:23:57.4)?
CLIENT: Not so much that I want to be free of it as that I don't like doing it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Maybe once this test is out of the way I'll just settle back and relax for a while, and just try not to define something or say to someone I'm going to do this now.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And let that drive me (ph).
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:24:26.8).
COUNSELOR: And maybe you'll try and see what's that like?
CLIENT: Yeah, I hope to. That's one of the ways I want to change I think. That might tie into the dishonesty quite a bit because you see, it's doing what - it's portraying an image to someone else, this is what I am like or this is what I'm going to do. And then just, after you've outlined that image just coloring it in.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And it might not be like me at all.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. And that's part of the (inaudible at 0:25:15.2) design?
CLIENT: Yeah, you see, all I'm doing is molding myself to the dishonesty.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's really cool. I mean, when I say cool, I mean it makes sense, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I'm comforted that something makes sense. I'm trying to see how that ties into anything else. I don't know. I - although I enjoy sort of basking in the accomplishments - well, based on when I go back home. Like, I've spoken quite a few times to my - well, the old high school keeps inviting me back. I was the first graduate in class.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I spoke at the commencement four years after I graduated, '68, yeah. And, like, I'm going to speak in April again. And I enjoy it, I wonder if I should.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. Because again, it's just the fact that I set up a goal or told someone I was going to be this way, was that way and that's what my life is comprised of. [0:26:37.8]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But after you reach the goal, then you enjoy the kind of praise that goes with it.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I always go back there. You see, yeah - there are so many people around me so far superior.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That being here there is no - there's nothing that would make me feel superior.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: However, if I go back far enough, there's someone somewhere that is impressed with my accomplishments.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's just like people say, "Wow, he's a physicist, he must really be smart." People have no concept at all. I mean, I am just so ignorant next to some of the people that I see every day.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That there's just no comparison. I just feel like a (inaudible at 0:27:21.6) my mouth (ph) when it comes to physics because I just don't understand. And yet, people - you can go into another sphere and people would just be awed by the fact that...
COUNSELOR: Oh, my, look at...
CLIENT: That one is - yeah.
COUNSELOR: One is a physicist, yeah.
CLIENT: And I guess I enjoy going back to that place.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Whatever it might be in, you know, I'm not just saying physics is the only thing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah. But what of what you're saying is, like, it's very - I don't know what the word is, but it's very hard or something to continually be in a situation where you're low on the totem pole. It's very nice to go back once a while where they would look up at you, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Admire, yeah.
CLIENT: I guess that's only natural, though. (Inaudible at 0:28:09.4), yeah, I don't feel too badly about that. I don't know. Yeah, I guess maybe I do because there's so many people that don't do that. They don't need to, they can just enjoy their own excellence.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: In themselves.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. Rather than - yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, to be recognized for your excellence amongst people who realize excellence is much greater than to, you know, just to have people that don't know anything about it, that think you're doing well.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, because they don't really know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: They don't have any way of judging you?
CLIENT: Right. Like - yeah, that's true all across the board, I mean, not just in physics, in everything. Like, I know for a fact that you can be just an average swimmer, and about two years of training and you could swim the Channel, there's just no way in the world. Just got to put on some weight and get some working in. And yet, I don't tell anyone that. If I told them that it would just take so much out of it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But you want it to look special.
CLIENT: Yeah, and it isn't because I'm (inaudible at 0:29:23.8), you know?
COUNSELOR: But yet, you know it isn't?
CLIENT: Well, you see, it can be in some spheres. (Inaudible at 0:29:32.1) far enough down on the pole.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:29:35.8]
CLIENT: Don't know how I feel about that. Another thing that I thought about, when anyone's in different circles of people they act differently. But yet, I don't think other people are really lying. I think they're bringing out different aspects of their personality.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And you can certainly see this - I mean, I don't (inaudible at 0:30:15.3) examples, you know what I mean?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I know what you mean.
CLIENT: Yeah, so - but with me it's not that way at all. It clearly isn't because if I'm in a contemplative group of people, I don't bring out that part of me that is contemplative. I look for what they're contemplating and bring it out. So I think one thing that I've got to watch - and not let it happen to me is just to act one way all the time because that isn't honest either.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, that if you change, you don't want to go that direction?
CLIENT: Yeah, like I did the other night, just to be, you know?
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:30:57.1).
CLIENT: But then the problem is, you know, how do you - you've got to - I think I'll probably end up having to know how I feel at a given point. Having to stop and say, well, how do I feel about behaving now?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Which is really unnatural.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: One should behave.
COUNSELOR: Unnatural to have to stop, it's seems less spontaneous.
CLIENT: Yeah, to stop and think, well...
COUNSELOR: Now how should I act?
CLIENT: Yeah, but that's (inaudible at 0:31:30.4). That's the whole way I'm doing it now, you see? It's sort of like saying, well, you've got a problem. And the only way to solve this problem is to do this. And yet, doing that is the problem.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: You see what I mean?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: It's a dilemma.
COUNSELOR: Now is this what you're saying? Like, what you do now is to stop and see how you feel, is that what you're saying?
CLIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: Be un-spontaneous?
CLIENT: Yeah, what I do now is I react to the way I think other people, you know, want me to behave.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And therefore, I'm not behaving naturally, I'm not being myself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So to get around this I'll have to think about how I feel and therefore, guide that behavior. But I'm still guiding that behavior, which is right back to where the problem is, that I'm guiding...
COUNSELOR: The problem is you're guiding your behavior? [0:32:20.5]
CLIENT: Yeah, and it's just sort of like changing the same symptom - no, same result but just - yeah, it is the same symptom, but changing the cause.
COUNSELOR: Well...
CLIENT: Doing the same thing, but doing it for different reasons.
COUNSELOR: Right, well, it sounds like there's one difference, though. The first time, you're doing what they want you to do, kind of falling into a pattern?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's right.
COUNSELOR: This way, you're falling into your own pattern, which you still may be guiding it that may be another difficulty. But it sounds like it's...
CLIENT: That's certainly a lesser problem, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Closer to what you want to be, even though it might not be - there might be - get another answer too.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'll straighten it out and then I'll need another 20 sessions, and the center will closed. That's all right, though, I'd rather be (inaudible at 0:33:15.6). I really have been interacting less lately than ever before, and I think that's probably good.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Now when I'm trying to sort things around and straighten them out.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, to be more by yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not taking any courses this quarter, so I'm just home studying. And my roommates are doing work up in Wisconsin, so they're out of town most of the time.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think that's probably good.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, so that would be too - although then again it might be bad, but have all these things inside and then I'll go out and it just won't work. It will all be for naught.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, it might be bad not to be trying (inaudible at 0:34:09.9).
CLIENT: Yeah, not to be - as one is thinking about growing and changing, to be growing and changing.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: That it sort of gives you - it's trial and error too.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: What you do. How would I have to - yeah, I suppose - one thing I touched on and probably I wasn't real honest about - oh, I'm not honest, I just didn't get to it was how I feel about June.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:34:57.8]
CLIENT: She - there's nothing you can say, this I don't like about her and that's why I'm being this way. I just can't do that.
COUNSELOR: You just can't...
CLIENT: No, there's simply nothing that I could say, well, you know...
COUNSELOR: You can't find anything?
CLIENT: No, I can't say, well, she's inconsiderate or she's 48 years old or, you know, (inaudible at 0:35:20.0) go or there is nothing. And yet, somehow there's a fear in me of eventually - well, is a minor thing, she's quite loquacious too, she'll go on and on and on and on. But it's not a trait that - it's just something that gets on your nerves after you've been with her a long time.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It's like, you know, anybody might rub your nose the wrong way.
COUNSELOR: That's not major enough either?
CLIENT: No, and it's certainly - I'm at the point now where I can just tell her, all right, I got it, fine, you know, I told her to stop talking.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: She tends to say something over and over. And yet, it's more than anything - it seems to be a far of not wanting to end up with a serious relationship with her.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That seems to be the motivating thought in my mind all the time.
COUNSELOR: Afraid that...
CLIENT: Well...
COUNSELOR: Trying to stay out of that?
CLIENT: Yeah, and yet, I still - you know, I keep going back for supper every now and then. And I tell myself she's a good cook, but there's something - you know, I don't know. There's sort of like a fear of not wanting it to deepen.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And yet, a desire to enjoy the good parts of the relationship.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, to enjoy it at this level, but holding back as far as getting closer.
CLIENT: Yeah, another strange thing. I would say probably with June I'm as honest as I am with anyone.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:36:59.0]
CLIENT: I really think that's the case. And yet, I'm really probably as far as a personal relationship being - treating her worse than I'm treating anyone.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I keep telling myself, you're not this way, you're not - why are you behaving this way? And yet, I do.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, you can't understand it?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, she really knows me. And I'm pretty sure she knows that nothing will, you know - (inaudible at 0:37:27.9). See, she thinks I'm just absolutely not affectionate at all.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That walking down the street, I simply won't hold hands with her. She's seen that many, many, many occasions.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And she thinks that's the way I am, when I'm not that way really.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And yet, in other things - that's just the way I'm behaving with her on the - well, the affection level.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: And yet, in other things she has come up with amazing insights about me. Like this thing about why I swam. And for that reason, I think she really knows me.
COUNSELOR: So it's very mixed. In some ways she doesn't know you at all?
CLIENT: Yeah, well, no, the only way she doesn't know me is how I feel about her.
COUNSELOR: I see, that's the only - yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, but she knows, like, a lot about what motivates me and things like that. Now here's something I just thought of. I'm really - if I were she - I mean, I would have long ago just said, get out of here, you know, like what (inaudible at 0:38:30.6), get out of my life. But she doesn't. And yet, I'm really being cruddy (ph), you know?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And the same token, I'm being honest. And I wonder if it's like - I don't know. Like, I've never once - you know, I've never once really implied to her that there was any deep emotion between us.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And that's true.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And when I leave her, you know, I never say anything about, oh, I'll see you again or I just forget, I just walk out and I leave. And maybe a week later I'll call her up or maybe the next day. And if she doesn't look good, if she's wearing something that really is ghastly, I'll say, "That really looks bad," you know, rather than not say anything.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And that's really being honest.
COUNSELOR: So what is it you're wondering about?
CLIENT: Well, the thing that I don't understand is, why should I - why should the honest me in that way be so bad and be so hateful to me?
COUNSELOR: Be so - oh, why should you dislike yourself so much in this situation where you're being so honest? Is that what you're saying? [0:39:48.3]
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess. See, what I think happened is I got to the point where I realize that what I like to think happened is, I got to the point where I realized that nothing would become of this relationship. And so I decided to be brutal about it and just to be honest, and that after a little bit of that she would turn me off.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But it didn't happen that way. So there am I being honest. If I just knew what made her tick, I think it would help.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That's really a strange - I just - you know, the one person that I'm really, you know, straight with, I don't...
COUNSELOR: You don't really understand?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's a very peculiar relationship. And the funny thing about is it when I get away from her, and I'm with anyone else that knows her, one of the most important things for me is to - anytime her name comes up is to disassociate myself with her.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know why.
COUNSELOR: Make it clear that you (inaudible at 0:41:09.5).
CLIENT: That there's nothing there, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but you don't (inaudible at 0:41:15.2)
CLIENT: This is very befuddling, I know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know if what I've said makes much sense. I just (inaudible at 0:41:21.3) know a lot about it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I also have - well, of course, now the weather is good too. The sap starts to flow and one feels, you know, really - sort of like springtime is a good time for falling in love. And I keep going along the streets and I just notice every chick that walks by.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And...
COUNSELOR: And you're attracted to them?
CLIENT: Yeah, well, it's a perfectly natural thing. This thing is - this part of it just doesn't settle right for some reason. Everything else is beginning to make a little sense. [0:42:06.2]
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I wonder if I should just sit down and tell her that I feel bad about the way I'm behaving. And just tell her I don't want to see her anymore because I feel I've exploited her.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. You wonder if that's a way that (inaudible at 0:42:30.1). How would that make you feel to do that?
CLIENT: I'd be - how would it make me feel? Well, it would sort of make - it would be the ultimate honesty in that relationship.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It would just set everything straight. She knows what motivates me in other senses, and how I feel about other things. I think she is the only other one that knows how I feel about physics by the way.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: What I just told you earlier. Then that's - yeah, that's almost certain. Everyone thinks I'm, you know, really fired up by it and dedicated. But - well, anyhow, if I were to straighten this out with her, then my relationship with her would be probably the only really completely honest one I've had.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I don't want to do that (inaudible at 0:43:29.5). I do want to do that, I mean, it's easy to say now, but it's so hard to say it when...
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It's hard to do.
COUNSELOR: Hard to take that one honest step with her?
CLIENT: No, it's not so much that. It's - well, it's just all of the advantages I'm reaping.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, like it is fun to go over there for supper?
CLIENT: Yeah, sure, she's a great cook and she's got a car if we want to drive somewhere, it's very convenient. And there's the sex thing too, which is...
COUNSELOR: Look at all you would be giving up.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's really sad. But I - it doesn't make much sense coming here if I don't do that, though, does it?
COUNSELOR: You mean to you, it doesn't make much sense to try to be honest if you're not going to...
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Do (inaudible at 0:44:24.7).
CLIENT: That's right, maybe I should do that. (Inaudible at 0:44:31.2). Between now and next time I'll see what I - I don't know. That's the next thing I think I should really think about, though.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, that's the next area.
CLIENT: Yeah, because if the whole thing is going to boil down to being honest, I might as well take this one relationship and start out with it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I have this horrible fear she's going to say - she'll say fine, why should we change anything? I know that's what she'll say.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I'm almost certain. Yeah, I think maybe I should (inaudible at 0:45:15.5). She's - well, I guess I don't know what motivates her. You see, she is really baffling because there's no reason in the world why she should think about me the way she does. Not that I know of anyhow.
COUNSELOR: Why she should love you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: When you treat her the way you do? [0:45:52.7]
CLIENT: Yeah, so I don't know if - I don't know how she would react to such - and honesty on my part would be rational at all. She might behave irrationally because I think she's behaving irrationally now. Ultimately, I think one of the reasons I came here is because I like to behave rationally.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I like to have my life as well organized as I have my letters, you know, my checks.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I couldn't settle out why I behave this way at this time, why I behave that way at that time. And I didn't like that at all.
COUNSELOR: The inconsistency bothered you?
CLIENT: Yeah, I wonder if that's - that could be probably the main reason why I dislike myself after an encounter where I haven't been myself is because of the inconsistency, I haven't been able to figure out.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Oh, it started out so good this time having everything all straight, and now it's getting (inaudible at 0:47:04.1).
COUNSELOR: Just getting it all sorted (inaudible at 0:47:05.3).
CLIENT: Yeah, where I don't know - well, it's what's on my mind; I might as well mention it. Is there some point along the way where I begin to get redundant or - and not synthesizing things well? And at that point, your role becomes as much guiding me - well, more guiding me through my thoughts and letting me just go on, or do you always have to just play it by ear and see how different people react?
COUNSELOR: I play it by ear.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Are you (inaudible at 0:48:01.8) asking something like, am I going to somehow play some kind of organizing role?
CLIENT: Yeah, because I'm really feeling right now that I'm not up to it. I just...
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's - see, it's hard for me to look upon all, you know, all these things that I mention and straighten them out objectively.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I think it's much - well, I don't know. I'm just sort of throwing off the burden onto your shoulders.
COUNSELOR: But what were you going to say?
CLIENT: Well, I was going to say that I would think it would - well, I'm probably not reacting to what I mentioned earlier, the fact that I came in here with - that I was really happy about I got something figured out.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And then after I sort of fit a few pieces of the puzzle together, I threw out so much more that maybe didn't fit in.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But I'm worried if I'm capable of putting the puzzle together.
COUNSELOR: I see, I see, you're worried if it will ever fit together?
CLIENT: Yeah, just sort of like - I guess, you see, I don't know how much of a role I play and how much of a role you play.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And whether, you know, whether this is just really me with - you know, like, I've got the puzzle and I'm trying - you tell me if this is the piece that fits, you know, in right there. And or whether you say - now this is a puzzle too, now I got another puzzle is how the puzzle is put together.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. [0:49:59.7]
CLIENT: Well, as you say, you have to play it by ear. If I just come in here and stop making any sense whatsoever, I'm sure that [I'm then] (ph) much more of an organizing role (inaudible at 0:50:12.6) on your shoulders.
COUNSELOR: I guess there's a couple of things been on my mind. One of them is, I guess what I'd like you to do is - well, I guess I'm beginning to get interested in what you say is really not so much the fact of, you know, oh dear, we have these extra pieces that don't fit. But, like, what it all means to you to get it organized or to have it disorganized because it sounds like that is something that has a whole lot of feeling in it.
CLIENT: I never thought about that. (Inaudible at 0:51:03.0) me and let me see if I understand you correctly. Do you mean not only is the thought of straightening my life out one of the thoughts we have to consider, rather whether or not this well ordered and well structured thing is the ultimate goal we're looking for, is that what you're saying?
COUNSELOR: Something like that, it's close to that or what it means to you, yeah, to get...
CLIENT: Oh, I see, yeah. I think it's probably very important to me just because of my highly organizational mind I want to say. So I think it is - I think I can answer that right now, you know, a top of the head answer is, yeah, it is important to me.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: The reason I came in here, though, is because I don't - after - because I simply didn't like myself.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, right.
CLIENT: Now is the reason why I didn't like myself because I'm not structured? I think so.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I see, I see. So that's the way you feel is that you would like (inaudible at 0:52:06.4) much better if you were structured. And really, the difficulty is that you're not?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I see.
CLIENT: See, the thing is, on my own, if I ever tried to put this puzzle together I would come out as I decided since last time. I would lie about the shapes of the pieces.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And there's no hope of putting together (inaudible at 0:52:27.1) that.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And for the first time I think I'm getting out the true pieces.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, I see, I see. I know that's very important, yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: I (inaudible at 0:52:37.8) that's cool. Maybe that's all I have to do. That's a good point. It might just be that once one is defined what the puzzle is, that might be enough. You know, honestly defined it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, tell me more what you mean by that? When one has done what? [0:53:00.2]
CLIENT: Well, okay, maybe I'll never understand why I pick.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: No, that's not right. I was going to say, see, there's a difference between me lying to myself and lying to other people, and trying to analyze why I behave on that basis and coming up with an answer that would have to be wrong. I mean, it's based on false premises.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: The difference between that and telling you the right pieces and being honest to you.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And yet, still not having them fit together.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: The latter being a much more desirable situation I think.
COUNSELOR: To at least have the honest pieces?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think that would probably be better. So - yeah, I want to keep creating analogies (inaudible at 0:54:07.1). Well, it's like having a puzzle - I mean, a real life jigsaw puzzle and just having one that - even though they're both in boxes and all confused, to have one that is complete and whole.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And you know there are no pieces missing, and every piece in there just belongs in that puzzle.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Whether or not you ultimately put it together might be important. It might be nice to look at the picture.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But it's sort of comforting knowing that you've got all the pieces in the box.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, even if you don't get it all put together, there's something comforting about having (inaudible at 0:54:38.3)?
CLIENT: Yeah, although I would feel, I think a little better if (inaudible at 0:54:43.8).
COUNSELOR: Still be uncomfortable not to have it put together.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know if anyone, though, really does. Does anyone ever really say, well, this is why I (inaudible at 0:54:56.5)?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean, have you ever - I mean, do you yourself know why you behave all the time a certain way?
COUNSELOR: No, I don't.
CLIENT: You probably feel much more comfortable about it. Most people probably feel much more comfortable about it than I do, though, I would think.
COUNSELOR: And with you it's really a very bothersome - bothersome.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: You don't know so often why you do things.
CLIENT: Yeah, after I've done them, not during.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:55:20.2) and say, oh, why did I (inaudible at 0:55:21.6)?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: I think by and large, people are more honest (inaudible at 0:55:29.3). Well, I'm kind of played out. (Inaudible at 0:55:48.5).
COUNSELOR: Well, (inaudible at 0:55:53.5).
CLIENT: (Inaudible at 0:55:54.7). I just get to a point where I get exhausted thinking about (inaudible at 0:56:01.0). Monday then at nine?
COUNSELOR: Right.
CLIENT: Okay, thanks.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
CLIENT: I'll see you then.
COUNSELOR: Okay, goodbye.
CLIENT: Bye-bye, keep the door open or shut?
COUNSELOR: You can leave it open.
