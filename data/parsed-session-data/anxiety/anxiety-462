BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> And I have a whole thing that shows who they are and what they're doing.
<b>PT:</b> All right, that's good.
<b>DR:</b> So, yeah, I don't know.  It's, it's the first time that anyone has tried to really figure out what goes on in here and, because they market so horribly.  They come in and say look, you're actually unusual 'cause you are kind of a one drug kind of person, but the vast majority of people here want ten different drugs, at all these crazy doses and, yknow, when they come to talk to us it's totally irrelevant to the vast majority of patients.  In your case, it's not because you're, yknow, kind of very simple.  Let me -
<b>PT:</b> I've been called simple many times in my life.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, your treatment is reasonably simple, which is good.  That means, well, it means that you have a good pre morbid brand, pre morbid meaning poor condition, and it didn't take much, it didn't take much aggressive treatment -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> To push you in the right direction.  That's good.  Good for you.  Yknow what?  I mean, a lot of people come here if after they failed one, two, three and four medicines and so, right from the get go, it's, it's roll the sleeves up and try to figure out what to get them - 
<b>PT:</b> It must be very frightening, for the person.
<b>DR:</b> It is.  But the good news is they did great.  I mean, there's a lot of medicines that are great.  They really did.  Probably, the, uh, best medical specialty to be in.  Yknow -
<b>PT:</b> Means you're doing a great job.
<b>DR:</b> And you get great results -
<b>PT:</b> You feel good.
<b>DR:</b> Very good.  Very gratifying.  All right.  I saw you [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Your mood has lifted.  You had three bad days.  Mostly not sad, not anxious, no panic attacks.  Your appetite was fine, a little GI upset, your sleep was interrupted, a little fitful, but feeling rested.  Your energy was okay, getting pleasure, some low concentration, your self-esteem was fine, some guilt.  We, we said you were partial remission at that point and we cranked the Zoloft up.
<b>PT:</b> I went up to 200.
<b>DR:</b> You went all the way to 200.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  And the 200 beat 100?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Your mood was better?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  How's your mood been recently?
<b>PT:</b> My mood is good.
<b>DR:</b> Let me, let me belabor that point.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Most of the time, you're not sad.
<b>PT:</b> Most of the time I fight becoming sad.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, that's too subtle for me.  Let's [INAUDIBLE] really simple.  And, uh, let me remind you that sadness is normal.  What's not normal is staying sad.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], like this February, I've begun to, if I'm not busy or occupied or doing something -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I will perseverate.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean perseverate? You mean obsess?
<b>PT:</b> Obsess.  I'm talking autism, perseverate.
<b>DR:</b> All right, on what?
<b>PT:</b> In my, what?
<b>DR:</b> On what will you obsess?
<b>PT:</b> On my life, on what happened, on -
<b>DR:</b> So you ruminate.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So, you have a tendency, when you're not occupied, to ruminate?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> On negative things?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yes, negative and [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> And how long do you get stuck before you can, um -
<b>PT:</b> I'll start saying, stop it [PATIENT NAME], stop it [PATIENT NAME].
<b>DR:</b> How much time?  How much time?
<b>PT:</b> It depends.  Till -
<b>DR:</b> Like a minute, an hour or a day?
<b>PT:</b> Intermittently, it can be just when I'm not doing something -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> I'll go and -
<b>DR:</b> If you had to add it all up in a typical day, how much time would you waste on this kind of nonsense?
<b>PT:</b> I'm so busy with my house honestly - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That I can't wait.  I don't just sit there.  It's also when I'm in the car, when I'm by myself, when I wake, yknow, before I'm engaged in -
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever been this way before?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> This is new.  You find your thoughts are racing?
<b>PT:</b> Racing?  No.  They're focused.
<b>DR:</b> They are.  Do you talk too much?
<b>PT:</b> Me?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you talk past the point?
<b>PT:</b> Say that again?
<b>DR:</b> Do you talk past the point?
<b>PT:</b> Past what point?
<b>DR:</b> The point you're trying to make?  If you make your point and then you keep talking.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> How many hours you sleeping at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um, eleven, eleven thirty till six thirty, seven.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Do you feel rested?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Energy during the day is normal?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You exercising?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How's your self-esteem?
<b>PT:</b> Could be better.  I'm not who I was before.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> In January.
<b>DR:</b> So you feel you've taken a real hit in your perception of yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel like you're no good?
<b>PT:</b> No, I just feel I'm not a good judge of character and -
<b>DR:</b> You mean regarding your husband?
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But -
<b>DR:</b> Is that what the rumination goes towards also?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So, it always goes back to -
<b>PT:</b> Goes back to him and life in general.  Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So not a good judge of character in who you married, or in just having missed signs?
<b>PT:</b> No, I now feel I really, if I couldn't get him right, how can I get anybody right?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?  Wow.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it kinda [INAUDIBLE], no I know.  
<b>DR:</b> Exactly, you've, uh, achieved a nice remission in your mood disorder, and yet, cognitively, you're falling into depressive thinking, mood.  You know, and, uh, don't take this word wrong, but depressive distortions, right?  People use -
<b>PT:</b> Well, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] yknow, corrects me every week.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, she, that's the best thing psychotherapy can do for you.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Help you correct the way you distort.  
<b>PT:</b> And, she points it out and then I laugh and then I get, kinda get it.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so your self-esteem is kinda low.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Any suicidal symptoms?  You feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You able to concentrate okay?
<b>PT:</b> I can read.
<b>DR:</b> You don't distract. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I can read a book.  I mean, I can read a novel.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to get pleasure normally?  Enjoy things?  Do you find you're anxious much of the time?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You are.
<b>PT:</b> There is only -
<b>DR:</b> If we scratched the surface, most of the day?  Most days there's anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> Not like it was.  It's only like two times since I saw you last that I feel the need to take half of a 5 mg Valium during the day.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  You taking the Klonopin?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> One every night.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Did the higher dose of Zoloft reduce some of the anxiety?  Or it hasn't changed or make it worse?
<b>PT:</b> No, it, I'm just acknowledging that I'm an anxious person and I'm recognizing a lot more than I did previously.
<b>DR:</b> So you -
<b>PT:</b> I think I'm learning more about knowing more how I truly am.
<b>DR:</b> You suspect that before all this happened you had anxiety problems.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And you just didn't acknowledge them.  You just put them into other -
<b>PT:</b> I was frenetically busy.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I went to graduate school, played with the family, three kids, I worked full time.
<b>DR:</b> You think you did that on anxiety juice.  
<b>PT:</b> I did it on, no I did it on [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> But you could be very industrious.
<b>PT:</b> No, it wasn't great.  I'm getting my doctorate.
<b>DR:</b> It's almost like, yknow, spinning it in a pathological, negative way and it doesn't have to be that way.
<b>PT:</b> No, it wasn't negative.  It was positive.  I turned my frustration at not being able to help [NAME OTHER] as much as I'd want to into helping other kids.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Which is good.
<b>DR:</b> That's not necessarily related to anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> I think the quantity and the amount but the way I was driven was a bit ridiculous.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Maybe a little manic?  Yknow, some people can stand -
<b>PT:</b> For years?
<b>DR:</b> If someone's hypertonic, you've probably what we call hypertonic, a hypertonic personality.  It's just -
<b>PT:</b> I always thought I was, like, the happiest person.
<b>DR:</b> Well, they usually are.  They are happy.  Happy, energized, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I feel just not as, I mean -
<b>DR:</b> And you can't get that back?
<b>PT:</b> I would like to.  I was much happier with myself previously, but so far it's -
<b>DR:</b> But, I, I would suggest we not, um, be revisionistic about it and say that you were all anxious about it.  That was a good spot.  That worked for you.  Although, uh -
<b>PT:</b> I was anxious as a mother, though.  That something would happen to my children.
<b>DR:</b> More than you saw other mothers.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, my God.  Monkey bars or riding a bicycle -
<b>DR:</b> You were always anxious [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>PT:</b> Running around the pool, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Definitely.
<b>DR:</b> You couldn't tone that down.  
<b>PT:</b> By the way, [INAUDIBLE] liked you so much.
<b>DR:</b> Thanks, I can't say anything about it but.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Although I did ask her if I could speak with you about, I'm pretty sure I did.  I think she gave me permission for that.  [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> She graduated from law school Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> Um, all right, so we have to try to connect the dots yknow, because it looks like the depression is finished, right?
<b>PT:</b> I would say it every day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, but that's your anxiety problem.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Anticipating negative things is your anxiety problem.  But the depressive illness that we saw you go through, right, when I, um -
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not laying on the couch immobile and uh -
<b>DR:</b> You were really, uh.  Right, exactly.  You were paralyzed with depression.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's gone, correct?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I would say for now.
<b>DR:</b> Well, okay -
<b>PT:</b> I'll stop myself.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, I try to get patients to be realistic about the possibility but you're now being overly negative.
<b>PT:</b> But I know the statistics so that freaks me out also.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the statistics, let me just see, yeah, this was your first big depressive episode.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Everything else was anxiety.  
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> On round one, you get, and there was a good reason -
<b>PT:</b> Not that it matters. 
<b>DR:</b> Not that it matters necessarily, but -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No, it, I mean it matters what sent you into it, but I'm talking just about the course and the potential for relapse.  That's all I'm talking about.  Um, on round one, you get better from the depression, your chances are about fifty fifty of getting a relapse.  On round two, if you've had a second one, that is far, far, higher, I mean we kind of call that a chronic illness.  You have a mood disregulation anyway, I think we can agree, you have some kind of anxiety disorder -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Separate from the depression.  It makes it a bit confusing because we use the same drugs to treat both.  Right?  Zoloft treats anxiety disorders and mood disorders, and depressive disorders, but it looks like it's not quite working for your anxiety problem if you're still living in what we call a free floating, anxious state.  You're not really anxious about one thing specifically.  You have some more global, free floating anxiety, is that correct?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, but it's also hard to keep that because I do have [NAME OTHER] -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Who is an ongoing worry and you may not be able to respond, however, [NAME OTHER] is an ongoing worry because she is so connected -
<b>DR:</b> To you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, but yknow -
<b>DR:</b> She's a bit immeshed with you.  
<b>PT:</b> A bit.  
<b>DR:</b> Okay, yknow, when she called, your name came up, is your name on her phone number?
<b>PT:</b> She might have called from home.
<b>DR:</b> Is she home a lot?
<b>PT:</b> No, she isn't.  My son is home a lot.  It might be him too, he's as [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um, and so why is it so stressful to you that she's a bit more immeshed for her age than she should be?  She's probably at a level that an [AGE] or [AGE] year old, yknow, individuating away from mom.  She's a bit delayed I would suspect. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh, absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> That's a stress to you?  Are you trying to push a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Well I worry.  Yeah.  I mean, I was going shopping with her, with her first [INAUDIBLE] and I was coming into the city and I get this phone call, she's hysterical, sobbing, I said [NAME OTHER], what's the matter?  She goes my shoe broke.  Your shoe broke?  I was trying not to smile because she'll sense right away, I said go buy a pair of flip-flops.  She said well, I am, I'm going to [DEIDENTIFIED].  Hysterical, hysterical, calls me again.  I feel like calling this person, no one helped me and I said [NAME OTHER] just get the shoes, no one's even looking at you.  People only care about themselves.  You're fine.  Don't worry about it.  That kind of thing.
<b>DR:</b> She didn't call me, and again, she did allow me to speak with you about it, so I'm not breaking confidentiality.  She didn't clue me in that this was an issue, but, um -
<b>PT:</b> What?  Calling me?
<b>DR:</b> Right, that kinda, it's uh, kinda, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> She doesn't handle stress well.  She already, we going to [DEIDENTIFIED], we leave tomorrow and [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] are coming on Friday.  She graduated Sunday, but [DEIDENTIFIED] started yesterday, already, she's like, uh, I'm too stressed, I can't go, I don't think I can handle it.  I said okay, don't go.
<b>DR:</b> She'll go.
<b>PT:</b> She'll go.
<b>DR:</b> Um, all right, I can see her.  Is she in psychotherapy?
<b>PT:</b> She's in psychotherapy, but we want, I would like her to switch therapists.  She's been with someone over ten years who actually saw all of my sons, myself and -
<b>DR:</b> Not [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], who helped my sister in law who had a drug problem, pretty much knew the whole family.  And then, when I had found out about [NAME OTHER] and she had spoke to me, she said yknow, I'm breaking the law, therapy law, like pretty much, I talked to her about my mother in law, about [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], who was fabulous, by the way with that.
<b>DR:</b> Good, very good.
<b>PT:</b> And, yknow, she said just, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Wow, you took three of us.
<b>PT:</b> Three of you.  But he was great with her, right away, yknow, you're not telling the truth [NAME OTHER] you're lying, about, um, [INAUDIBLE] you're functioning and she had said to me I had heard about [NAME OTHER] before I even knew any of the [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, really?
<b>PT:</b> So, that like made me feel, holy shit, what, what -
<b>DR:</b> I don't think she should have said that.
<b>PT:</b> Of course not, but she said I'm speaking as a friend but that totally -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] even friends shouldn't -
<b>PT:</b> Well, whatever -
<b>DR:</b> And that had to have been very painful.
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] wanted to tell [NAME OTHER] and then I convinced him that he needed to see someone and he's seeing someone who [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. And recommended.  [NAME OTHER] had a list of names that [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] recommended and she's just working up the courage and I said -
<b>DR:</b> I can get her someone in the city if she needs.  [NAME OTHER] probably has [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> No.  [INAUDIBLE] She has plenty of people.  
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] is seeing [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Um, okay, so that's another stressor.  You have, you have these family stressors.
<b>PT:</b> I have tons of family stressors.
<b>DR:</b> What's striking is that you're on a good, healthy dose of SSRI, the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And your free-floating anxiety is still, could anything else be going on?  Take any medicine I need to be worried about?
<b>PT:</b> Like what?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know.  Anything?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I take all my asthma medication.  I take my high blood pressure medication, which [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Ever get a sense that any of the asthma meds rev you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No anxiety from that.  And, uh, you tried on and off with most of your meds and there's no relation to your anxiety?  I mean, you just have bad luck.  Yknow, your bad luck that we're not able to use Zoloft to double coverage.  Now, that doesn't mean I'm going to throw medicine at you right now, unless you really want it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>DR:</b> But throwin' medicine at you right now for anxiety, but, I think it's fairly clear that you're depressive illness is in decent remission and I don't think you should be worried.  And that's your anxiety sort of, kind of your anxiety is sort of just looking for risks for it to mill, which just churns up some anxiety.  Oh, yeah, I have depression, now I'm defective and I'll always be depressive.  Some kind of nonsense.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm definitely on guard.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I have to work on that.
<b>DR:</b> Banish that from your mind.  Really banish it.  We can at least, we'll bring it back when we decide to go down on the Zoloft and talk about your risks and blah, blah, blah.  That's six months or a year in advance.  Don't worry about that at all.  Depression is done.  It's a thing of the past.  It was a bad experience.  It was even a bit traumatic, but it's gone, again it, it's over.  Now, let's deal with your current mood disorder, which is an anxiety disorder, okay?  Which it sounds like is always happening, right?  And it's always driven you.  And the other thing that seems to have helped is Valium, right?  You use Valium?
<b>PT:</b> Never during the day.  At night.
<b>DR:</b> And it helps at night?  Valium helps?
<b>PT:</b> I mean the only time I've used it during the day is when I thought I was gonna fall into a panic attack.  And that's only when I tie together that I'm an anxious person, recently, and it helps. 
<b>DR:</b> Um, there are essentially two types of treatments for anxiety disorders.  One is SSRI, which you're on.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, which changes the threshold on, yknow, panic.  Because you can get a panic attack, if we bring it to the lab and gave you lactic acid or, or a few of the things we know set off panic, we can always get you to panic.
<b>PT:</b> No, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  I mean, it's just part of how you're hard wired.  And so, the real question is changing the threshold for panic.  Right?  If you raise the threshold high enough -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Like, we'll throw things at you that will set you over and that's what Zoloft does.  Zoloft kinda changes the threshold.  And so, probably on Zoloft, you haven't had panic attacks.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Right and, yknow, in that regard, your anxiety disorder is under better control.  For many, many people, Zoloft also changes this generalized free-floating anxiety and just turns the volume down on it.  You're not getting that effect from this.  The other class of medicine, or types of medicines we use for anxiety problems are Valium type or, yknow, in the class of medicines that increase GABA, G A B A, it's a neurotransmitter that kind of tamps things down and it's, yknow, it's not as exquisite or subtle as the SSRIs where you really change to gain on the system, it's more just turning the volume down, just tamping it down in the context of hoping you don't get side effects.  Yknow, whenever you tamp down, the potential side effects are the kinda of slowing, slurring, yknow, all of those things we don't want.  So that's kinda the second class.  Now, there's a third class, and within that second class, I would put, yknow, obviously the benzo based, so Klonopin, Xanax, Ativan, Valium, all of those and sometimes with generalized anxiety, I frequently put them on round the clock antianxiety medicines.  So, for Klonopin, it would be a morning dose and a nighttime dose.
<b>PT:</b> Wouldn't I be tired, though?
<b>DR:</b> Well, the thing of beauty is this.  There is a perfect dose that mocks up the anxiety without making you tired, but you have to find that dose.  So, it would be a crumb.  I mean, in the beginning you'd try to, yknow, a crumb, crumb, crumb and then inch your way up.  If you still have anxiety, you didn't take enough.  If you got tired from it, you took too much.  And somewhere in between those two is your perfect dose.  And so, you find your dose.  And you don't have to do this now, this could be in six months or a year.  It doesn't matter.  This is how anxiety disorders get better.  If you do that round the clock antianxiety to just contain it.  And, yknow, maybe magical thinking, but I think that if you keep people out of that anxious state for a long time, the whole condition gets better.  That may or may not be true.  The other things I consider that are kinda in that same realm are medicines like Neurontin.  Have you heard of Neurontin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you put me on it and I didn't think it did anything.  That was before -
<b>DR:</b> Well, in the same, right, well you had a pain syndrome in the beginning.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, the -
<b>DR:</b>  The blepharospasm.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you still have it?
<b>PT:</b> Not as bad.  Not as bad as before.
<b>DR:</b> It's anxiety related, or often can be.  At least indirect.
<b>PT:</b> So, that's a good thing that it's gotten better.
<b>DR:</b> Neurontin is kind of in that GABAergic tamping down and there are a couple of others, Gabitril, whatever.  Sounds like you probably, if we were to go that route, around the clock, uh, benzodiazepine, Valium, Klonopin, whatever, it's probably the way to go.  The third one, it's an old drug that we don't really use much any more, called BuSpar.  Have you heard of that?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Now, back when it came out, yknow, and its only indication is generalized anxiety disorder.  It's only for this.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> The problem is for the vast majority of people, it doesn't work.  But when it works, it's really nice because it's free.  I mean, there's no side effects, there's nothing.  You just go on it and some people have the great luck that it just works.  And, boom, anxiety turns off.
<b>PT:</b> And you're not near dead or dull or lack -
<b>DR:</b> No, no, none of those benzo side effects.  Totally different.  Dopamine, no one knows, we do a lot of hand raising about how it works, no one knows how it works.  But, for some people it works.  The problem is it doesn't work for enough.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, I tried it a lot.  I have a few for who it works great.  And it was recently studied, it's interesting, we um, there's a study called STAR D, huge big study of depression in which, yknow, multi, multi million dollar study from the NIH and the key question in the outpatient office today is what do you do after people have failed one antidepressant, yknow, blah, blah, blah.  So they chose BuSpar as one of the augmenters.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, because we all knew it didn't work so we were, yknow, it was one of the big sides that did the thinking of the design was up at [DEIDENTIFIED] so I know the thinking behind it.  They figured BuSpar we know doesn't work, so let's use it as one of the arms.  We'll augment with BuSpar versus augmenting with Wellbutrin or one of the other antidepressants.  It turned out it worked.  Yknow, for depression augmenting with BuSpar worked in a decent percent, about a third of the people.  So, it now has kind of a new life as an antidepressant augmentation.  Not as an antidepressant -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But to add to an SSRI.  People started out on Celexa, yknow, thousands of people.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Everyone got Celexa.  The thirty percent who got better right away, they're out.  Then you take everyone else and augment it with BuSpar, and others and another round and it was a very interesting, complicated study, but yknow, BuSpar turned out to work, even though the anticipation was it wouldn't work at all.  So, it has a bit of a new life now in that regard.  And in your case, yknow, it's not a bad thought also, yknow, it would augment the Zoloft in some way to lift your mood.  But more so, for you, it would be a medicine for your generalized anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> There's no side effects, and it's fine with everything else I take?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Now, we're early in treatment.  You don't have to, actually yknow, these are chronic illnesses.  This isn't passing, yknow, this is not pneumonia, so there's no rush to do any of this now.  I've thrown a lot into the forum.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> I can write it all down, you can search 'em.
<b>PT:</b> I'll remember.
<b>DR:</b> Think about 'em.
<b>PT:</b> I know 'em.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  All right. [INAUDIBLE] 'cause I'm gonna write 'em anyway.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and we talked about -
<b>PT:</b> The benzos and then the Neurontin.
<b>DR:</b> So, we have one is benzos and that would be -
<b>PT:</b> Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b> Klonopin, Ativan, Xanax I don't use.  So, Klonopin would be q. twelve hours and Ativan would be q. eight hours.  And that, and remember, either of those would be finding your precise dose to not be tired, but to not be anxious.  So, I, I'll put your perfect dose.  Obviously, the nighttime dose, you could be tired with.  So, that'll be the bigger dose.  All right?  And the second grouping was, I'll make the second one the GABA.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, um, we'll just put Neurontin and Gabitril, but there are others, too.  And we could actually also put in these anticonvulsants.  And, yknow, things like Lamictal, Triptil, blah, blah, blah.  We'll talk about that if that's of interesting to you.  And then the third group would be the BuSpar.
<b>PT:</b> I'm hoping to conquer my anxiety with self-awareness and refraining.
<b>DR:</b> Actually, that's the best way.  And when it's been studied carefully, therapy beats meds.  It really does for OCD for anxiety disorders, therapy beats meds.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], I mean I'm surrounded by OCD crazies.  My husband and [NAME OTHER] and, of course, [NAME OTHER].  Would I become a bit that way?
<b>DR:</b> For, while we're on it, I suggest people read Brain Lock.  Have you heard of that book?  It's a book about OCD and gives specific techniques for breaking those loops.  You can just get it at Barnes and Noble.  It's actually well worth it.  And, um, yknow, CBT, no.  [INAUDIBLE].  
<b>PT:</b> But I also, from reading these books about the techniques and [INAUDIBLE] life training, whenever I back up now, I just feel [INAUDIBLE].  I always think oh, God, I hope I didn't hit someone, only because the book classes [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> Uses that as a classic OCD -
<b>PT:</b> Which I never even thought of.  I'm like oh shit.
<b>DR:</b> I had a guy stop driving, it was disabling.  It wasn't backing up.  It was any bump, he would think he hit someone.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, he'd keep turning back and, yknow, just they're great stories.
<b>PT:</b> I know they're great stories.  I don't want to become one.
<b>DR:</b> One guy would look over at his wife and get the thought to kill her, yknow, one guy was obsessed with glass.  Apparently in a frame in glass, there's one spot that has a weakness.  I don't know, whatever, so he'd be down there in his basement, yknow, essentially breaking old, yknow, finding that one spot.  One guy, this is the last one, one guy was obsessed with, um, calling nine one one and calling nine one one, hang up.  Yknow, see how quick, yknow, that, yknow, honestly they came and he went to jail eventually he did it so many times.  Same guy who, uh, was some kind of systems analyst at his job, he set it up that if he touches that button, all the hard drive or whatever, really bad, yknow. And eventually he did it, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> That's like [NAME OTHER] if I take him to a museum or an art gallery, you don't touch the paintings, you can't touch the paintings.  
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, it's just, it's very interesting, but can be disabling, yknow.  Therapy works really well.  It really does, if people stick with it.  All right, you're in remission from the depression.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Your GAD is, I'm gonna put plus minus.  We're considering, um, benzo or BuSpar essentially.  When you, so, do you want a prescription now or do you wanna think about it?
<b>PT:</b> As opposed to when?
<b>DR:</b> Next time you come in or I can call it in.
<b>PT:</b> How long is the prescription good for?
<b>DR:</b> We can just call it in.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, all right, so then hold off.
<b>DR:</b> We'll call it in.
<b>PT:</b> If I feel I need it -
<b>DR:</b> I'll give you the information sheet for BuSpar.  And yknow, think about it.  There's no rush with you.  Actually, the worst part about it is it's a three time a day drug.  Most people would get away twice a day and, yknow, I usually do 5, 5, for about five days and then 10, 10, for a few days, then 15, 15.  And that's a decent dose, 15 twice a day.  But I have people on all different doses.  You get, I think two or three months.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so, I need Zoloft for -
<b>DR:</b> She'll give you whatever you need.  Um, you get, I mean, traditionally, the thinking was, or the, you get nothing for two weeks, and then it works.  So you can't, it's not like Valium.  It's just something different happens and it just takes time.  It settles in and boom, anxiety lifts, when it works. 
<b>PT:</b> So, I've got nothing to lose by -
<b>DR:</b> Nothing to lose.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I've seen it work, I've seen it not work.
<b>PT:</b> All right, so I'll try it and I've got nothing to lose.  
<b>DR:</b> Read about it first, and then, and then, uh, we'll decide.  Actually, I'll write it on your chart, so if you call they'll just give you, these prescriptions are anti-theft. They'll just call me up.
<b>PT:</b> Well, can't I ask for one now?
<b>DR:</b> You want it now?  You gonna try?
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I might not, but I'd rather have the prescription.
<b>DR:</b> BuSpar, if I give you the 15s, you have to try to break it in thirds those first five days, okay?  It's easier.  You need the Zoloft, too?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  I take 200 mg.
<b>DR:</b> No side effects?
<b>PT:</b> Not that I'm aware of other than stomach.
<b>DR:</b> It bothers your stomach?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's getting really, really bad.  I have cramps in the morning and -
<b>DR:</b> Diarrhea? 
<b>PT:</b> Um, just once in a while but I take Bentyl.  Not during the morning.  But, my GI told the intern yesterday I went on [INAUDIBLE] directly tied to a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] because that and Bentyl is positive, is serotonin drug, as is Zoloft, so -
<b>PT:</b> So, I took it at night because -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  It's a good antidote.  It's a good antidote.  Okay, good.  Take care.  See you in two or three months.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Bye, bye.
