<b>DR:</b>	So when you say this is not very accurate meaning, doing the zeroes?  Okay.  Why?  Are you having problems?
<b>CG:</b>	She's had her second meltdown.  She had a meltdown this week again.
<b>PT:</b>	Usually I'm okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  She's just—
<b>CG:</b>	Sunday night and then Monday morning.
<b>DR:</b>	When you say meltdown like what happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I cry and, um, my stomach hurts and I can't eat.
<b>DR:</b>	Get anxious, depressed, down?  And is that related to school or school?  Yeah, they probably don't capture that.
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	And that part of that.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, I think with such large classes they're not noticing, um—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm good at hiding it.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, they're not noticing her because she's quiet and she's sitting there and I don't, I don't know how much she's actually getting out of the classes because, uh, when she comes home we have to redo everything and that's I think where the anxiety, most of it's coming in.  So we're up until 11:30, 12:30 at night.  She's not getting enough sleep.  But I've talked to the teachers about giving her less work and they're being really cooperative.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because like with math I'll color, I'll draw during the class because I know the stuff but then they give me like 50 problems and I'm like da da da da da da, it takes me forever because it's boring.  Really, I feel like Albert Einstein.
<b>CG:</b>	She also said that when she comes out of the class that she forgets what they were doing, is that right, something like that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, not usually my last classes, sometimes I'll forget like I have this, a test the next day.  And then usually forget, sometimes I forget to write down something in my planner.  And every single night I always forget to check my planner.
<b>CG:</b>	Now in the evenings she's got no attention span at all.  She really doesn't have 5 or 6 hours worth of schoolwork.  She does have all of the schoolwork, but, and it takes us that long to do it but she's just, she can't concentrate, she's all over the place.
<b>DR:</b>	So that's the ADHD part.
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The depression part, how is that, other than what you just described.  Has that been okay?  Or is bit better?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Does this all this get you so down more than the anxiety that you find it hard to pull yourself up or you do kind of gather yourself later and say I'm better?
<b>PT:</b>	It's really hard and I need mom to help me.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, she's, uh, on Monday she didn't go to school.  She couldn't get it together to go to school on Monday.
<b>PT:</b>	One would have had to have literally dragged me out of the house.
<b>DR:</b>	So sleep's okay other than the fact that you're up so late trying to take care of things.
<b>CG:</b>	And then, yeah, school starts really early for them.  Get up and go early.
<b>PT:</b>	Apparently it's better for me because I'm not that tired anymore.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she's able to get up better than she was when she was sleeping in until nine or ten.
<b>DR:</b>	With the Paxil, you're still at 10 a day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	I think it's probably hard to tell, um, the anxiety from the depression.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.  [INAUDIBLE].  Well, let's leave the Paxil where it is.  You're not on 10 twice a day, just 10 once a day.
<b>CG:</b>	We did that for a little while but then we eased off so now we're back to 10.  I didn't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Let's, um, we could change as far as the ADHD is concerned.  Uh, maybe at least for the morning, one going up to 15.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Instead of the 10 [INAUDIBLE] for now.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Then let's decide.
<b>CG:</b>	Should it be running out with the afternoon one by the time she gets home from school?
<b>DR:</b>	Would you want to try an extra half in the evening?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  At least until she gets that under control.  She's doing really well in school.
<b>DR:</b>	Grade wise.
<b>CG:</b>	Grade wise, yes.  Well, we stay up all night getting it done.  And if I have a meeting or anything she doesn't get anything done while I'm gone.  I have to stand over top of her.
<b>PT:</b>	There'll be like one little question that I have to ask, unless she answers it I can't do all of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But there's always that one question and it's always at the very beginning or like in the middle.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but you never think to go on to your next question or anything.  She sits there with that question probably for hours.
<b>PT:</b>	I try and figure it out.
<b>CG:</b>	I'm the one who's exhausted.
<b>DR:</b>	Does she have to do it every day.
<b>CG:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Late at night?
<b>CG:</b>	Yes.  And [NAME OTHER] was giving me a lot of trouble too.  Not intentionally but [INAUDIBLE].  You get to see her next week, I think.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's do that.  Let's meet back in a month.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I wanted to tell you that, um, I didn't notice but until like yesterday that my medicine, my ADD medicine must be working because when I was younger I just like walked around and walk into a room and then forget what I was looking for.  I never do that anymore.  I didn't realize it until yesterday.
<b>CG:</b>	I do it all the time.
<b>PT:</b>	I never do it anymore.  Except for like twice in a year maybe [INAUDIBLE] something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.  That's good.  And it looks like it's kind of helping, you know, at school too.  If you're not doing it there then you're more focused but looks like it kind of runs out and then it's a problem, not just for but for mom too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't notice when it runs out  usually.
<b>DR:</b>	But I'm glad at least the depression part is good and the anxiety I think should settle down with us getting the ADHD part under control.
<b>CG:</b>	I think so too, I think that'll help a lot.
