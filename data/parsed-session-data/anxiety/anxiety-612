<b>N</b>ikolaus comes back from dinner at the Miners' looking more
sad and worried than I've ever seen him. "How did it go?" I
ask him. He just shrugs and walks away. I don't want to press him
to talk. I don't want him to be in the middle between me and the
Miners, but that's where he seems to be, and I don't know what
to do about it.


I am also worried about Matthew. He's seems angry a lot of
the time. Specifically, he seems angry at Nick. I notice that whenever
someone begins to talk about Nick, Matthew finds an excuse
to leave the room. He will avoid going into the living room, which
is still filled with pictures of Nick. "We should put those pictures
away now," he says one day. "Papa's gone."


I'm afraid that the few memories Matthew has of Nick will
get lost and all he will be able to remember is this awful anger
and hurt. I'm afraid that later, when Matthew is older, he will not
be able to remember anything about his father.

Someone has given us an activity book designed to help
children who have experienced the death of a parent. Matthew
will have no part of it. When I offer to help write down what
he remembers about his papa, he presses his lips together until
they turn white. He scribbles on the pages where he is supposed
to draw pictures of activities he and his father liked to do
together. One day, I find the book hidden in the bottom of the
kitchen garbage can.


"Leave him alone," Nikolaus advises. "He'll remember what
he wants to remember." I remember Nikolaus as a small boy coming
home from his Aunt Robyn's house and stuffing the pictures
she made him draw of his mother far under his bed. I decide to
take his advice.


The counselor from Nikolaus's school calls me. "Would you like
to come in and talk to me?" she asks. "I have some resources that
you may find helpful." I wonder if she thinks Nikolaus is having
problems adjusting, if she knows about the adoption problems.
We set a time to meet.


The counselor meets me in the school office and then leads
me to a large classroom crowded with metal desks. In the corner
is a small room with real walls and a door that closes.


She is a thin, red-haired woman with a kind face. "Call me
Sara," she says. "I'm sorry for your loss. I was wondering if I
might be of some help."


Her office is tidy but cozy, with bookcases lining two walls
and a rag rug on the floor. We sit not at her desk, which is pushed
to one side, but at a central table with swivel chairs upholstered
in a cheerful print. On her side of the table sits a small pile of
books and a thin, neat folder, which she is now consulting.


"I met with Nikolaus for the first time when he returned to
school after the funeral," she continues. "Then we met again last

"We are dealing with a lot of issues right now, as you might
expect," I say. "But the kids seem to doing okay, I guess. They
play a lot of video games."


"That's understandable," she says. "When the real world gets
scary, it's natural to want to retreat into a fantasy world. And a
fantasy world that has a controller is especially appealing."


"Maybe I should try it," I reply lightly.


Her smile is warm. "I'm not sure if you are a person who
finds books helpful," she says, "but I've pulled some from our
counselor's collection that you may find useful." She pushes the
small stack of books toward me. The titles look interesting. <i>Losing
Someone You Love, Helping Children Cope with Grief</i>. I thank her
sincerely.


She pulls a sheet of paper out of the folder and lays it in
front of me. "I've called a number of community service organizations
to find out what types of grief services they offer. I made
this list." She points to each name in turn and provides a brief
explanation of what kind of services the organization provides,
who its sponsors are, and what the costs might be. I am touched
and grateful that she had done this for us.


"Nikolaus seems like a very nice kid," she says. "And in my
job, unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot of time to spend with
the nice kids. I really think Nikolaus will be fine, but there is one
thing you should know. He is very worried about you."


"About <i>me</i>? Why, what did he say?"


"Whatever he tells me is confidential, of course. But I can
tell you that the best thing you can do for him right now is to try
to take care of yourself. If I can help you identify resources to do
that, please don't hesitate to call me."

One of the names on the list is a family counseling service, and
the first thing I do when I get home is call them. They set up an
appointment and fax me some preliminary paperwork that asks
for our names, ages, nature of the problem, and annual household
income. Three days later, the boys and I are standing in front of a
large house off a main street in Oakland. A small sign discreetly
announces it as the ANN MARTIN CHILDREN'S CENTER.


Nikolaus's counselor had told me that it was a nonprofit
group that specialized in helping children. When I called to
make the appointment, the woman on the phone explained
that they offer their counseling services on a sliding scale to
children who are victims of or who have witnessed violence,
children with parents in prison, or children, like mine, who are
dealing with loss.


"I'm not going in," Matthew announces from the back seat.
"I'll just wait here."


"Come on," Nikolaus says. "Let's just get this over with."


It is a bad start. We finally coax Matthew inside, but I have
to drag him up the steps. In the waiting room, he refuses my offer
to read him a book or to play with the toys scattered around the
room. He sits, arms crossed, on a chair in the corner of the room
farthest from where Nikolaus and I sit. "Why don't you just smack
him?" Nikolaus suggests.


Our counselor is young, very pretty, and painfully sincere.
Her name is Adrienne. She dresses comfortably in a slightly more
polished version of the khakis and fleece vests that Nikolaus always
wears, and I can tell immediately that they will develop a
rapport. I don't have the same hope for Matthew; he's clearly not
ready to talk to anyone yet.


We spend this first session getting out the basic facts: what
happened, how we felt then, how we feel now. Nikolaus and I take
turns talking, adding our perspectives and finishing each other's
thoughts. Matthew refuses to talk. He turns his chair away from
