<font size="4"><b>Chapter 3: Families: Life-Span Socialization in a Cultural Context</b></font>

A critical strength of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities
is strong family and social ties that buffer many API individuals
from the devastating consequences of life crises. Despite the critical role that
families play in API communities, there is a scarcity of psychological research on
how socialization and life-span developmental processes produce resiliency or
nonadaptiveness among API families living in the United States. This chapter
highlights our current knowledge about API families.


A basic function of families across human cultures is to nurture adaptive life
skills and positive emotional attachment for support of family members over the
life course. This is a series of complex processes in one cultural context but becomes
even more challenging when families must bridge two sometimes conflicting
cultures. Culture is not homogeneous or static but rather is tempered by what
exists in a given historical time in which it is learned and by whom it is learned;
varied by the family socialization of these attitudes, values, and behaviors; and
incorporated by the individual's perception of this cultural training that changes
with life experiences, social context, and developmental challenges. In other words,
a person's cultural schema is a slice of an individual's interpretation of a family's
perception and socialization of culture within a given historical moment that is
subject to continual revision over a lifetime.


Research on API families living in the United States must examine interactional
socialization processes as intentional socialization or unintentional

Family socialization is a reciprocal process flowing from older to younger
family members and with younger family members also socializing their elders
(Basic Behavioral Science Task Force of the National Advisory Mental Health
Council, 1996). Enculturation, socialization, and acculturation are ongoing processes
that exert their influences by generation, age and developmental tasks, gender,
ethnicity, and social class across behavioral and situational domains.
Acculturation refers to the process of accommodation and acceptance of certain
elements from two distinct cultures through contact, conflict, and adaptation.


Kagitcibasi (1989) argued that even when contextual conditions change from
agrarian to industrial societies, the maintenance of interdependence as a family
value must be explained as more than a function of environmental conditions.
Findings across Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and India, as well
as among ethnic minorities and working-class families in the United States, suggest
that across these varied contextual environments, expectations of interdependency
and close-knit family relations might not have direct survival value but
might have psychological, emotional, social, and economic benefits in urban environments.


Data suggest that important API cultures persist beyond more superficial
cultural habits, often used as indicators of acculturation due to ease of measurement
(e.g., language, arts and crafts, dress habits). A closer examination of the
patterns of social relationships, such as family problem-solving skills, role of culturally
shaped emotional responses, and communication patterns in API families,
may reveal maintenance of important cultural features due to adaptive value in
the new sociocultural context. What appears as complete Americanization over
one or two generations may, in fact, be acculturation for more superficial American
behaviors such as in food preferences, dress, language, and communication
patterns than for more deep-seated values, social support practices, and emotional
responses to life crises (Nishi, 1995). These deep API cultural roots might be
evident two generations past the American-born generation of APIs. Moreover,
American-born generations of APIs behave in a more situation-specific manner
in response to the specific demands of the social context. For example, Nisei
Japanese Americans might behave more American at work while among American
co-workers, whereas they might behave more Japanese at home or while visiting
more traditional family members (Miyamoto, 1986-1987).


This chapter takes an ecological approach to examining life-span developmental
challenges for API families living in the United States. These issues change
as API family members make transitions throughout each stage of the life cycle.

<b>ECOLOGICAL APPROACH AND CHALLENGES
FOR ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER FAMILIES</b>


An ecological approach views persons as active agents in a series of interlocking
systems that pose both risks and opportunities. Interaction with the immediate
social environment in the context of the larger society propels development. Development
is viewed as the individual's evolving understanding of the ecological
environment, one's relation to it, and the capacity to discover, explore, and change
its properties (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). As families encounter ecological challenges,
they develop adaptive strategies reflective of the cultural and family system
(DeVos, 1982). These strategies may be viewed as maladaptive by society, yet
they serve some functional value within the immediate social environment. There
is increasing consensus that the individual must be understood in the context of
the family and sociocultural environment (Basic Behavioral Science Task Force
of the National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1996; Kaslow, 1987; Sampson,
1988; Sue &amp; Zane, 1987; Szapocznik &amp; Kurtines, 1993).


<i><b>Ecological Challenges</b></i>


The ecological challenges and their resulting adaptive strategies can lead to
differential outcomes for ethnic minorities (Harrison, Wilson, Pine, Chan, &amp;
Buriel, 1990). Two ecological challenges commonly faced by API families are
minority status and acculturation.


Minority status, often associated with physical and linguistic differences from
the mainstream society, confers a subordinate position, a restricted range of options,
and reduced opportunities for mobility and success. In addition to the normative
tasks of development, APIs must master the stress of "being different"
and overcome the labels of "inferior" and "not belonging." Minority youths often
suffer from early traumas, such as personalized taunts of racial prejudice on the
playground and discrimination in the classroom, that can be attributed to the

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A family and social ecology that is adaptive for minority children will generate
support systems to minimize the destructiveness of minority status. Children are
taught to selectively internalize "reflected appraisals" (Rosenberg, 1979) from
their surroundings to establish strong self-concepts and healthy self-esteem. Spencer
(1987) found that parental interventions to increase awareness of unique ethnic
strengths provided resilience in the face of racial insults and produced highly
developed social skills among African American children. The salience of a child's
minority status will vary according to the ethnic composition of the daily contexts.
As Asian American children negotiate these various contexts, coping with hostility
or acceptance becomes entwined with the developmental tasks at hand.


Another ecological challenge for API families is the tensions felt by the varying
acculturation levels of family members. For API Americans, the meaning of being
API is complex and often associated with mixed valence. Although Asian American
groups have resided in the United States for several generations, the majority
of the current API population are foreign born and still in the process of acculturating
to the host society.


Varying degrees of acculturation in API families is an ever present intervening
variable that produces different ecological challenges as these families attempt
to master developmental tasks. For example, if the parents are monolingual Chinese,
then the bilingual child's entry into the school system and the associated
tasks might be quite different from those of a child from a third-generation, English-speaking
Chinese American family. The task of language acquisition might
be confounded by different language priorities. Immigrant parents emphasize
the native language, whereas children prefer to speak the language of their mainstream
peer group.


The influence of culture might not always be so apparent. Each successive
generation of Japanese Americans was more acculturated than the previous generation,
yet studies indicate that significant differences remain between Japanese
American and Caucasian American families such as "behaves well" versus "self-directed"
as developmental goals (O'Reilly, Tokuno, &amp; Ebata, 1986) and maintenance
of Japanese rearing patterns among third-generation Japanese Americans
(Caudill &amp; Frost, 1972).


<b><i>Family Characteristics and Socialization Strategies</i></b>


An effective strategy might involve an integration of the dominant culture's
values with those of the minority group such as recognition of minority status
and its implications for the social hierarchy (DeVos, 1982). Ethnic minority parents
use socializing and learning strategies found to be effective and passed down

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a classic API family study, Johnson ( 1977) examined how interdependence,
reciprocity, and indebtedness helped maintain family solidarity among third-generation
Japanese Americans in Hawaii. She argued that maintenance of kinship
relations among second- and third-generation Japanese Americans was based
on an obligatory system rather than on an optional one as in the Caucasian American
kinship system. Lifelong and ongoing exchange of services, advice, reciprocity,
and indebtedness increased the level of social contact and sociability among
Japanese families. Johnson noted that the Japanese values of interdependence,
reciprocity, and indebtedness were present three generations past the first American-born
generations and served to preserve adaptive family strengths while
strengthening Japanese families in Hawaii. Grandparents cared for grandchildren
because both adult children worked to afford the high cost of living in Hawaii.
In turn, grandparents were provided care when they became frail or during episodic
health crises. Johnson suggested that traditional cultural family patterns
are maintained, although somewhat changed, but remain adaptive long after acculturation
to more superficial American lifestyles has occurred.


Collectivism is another adaptive family pattern among API Americans. Global
studies of non-Western cultures and minority groups in Western countries have
suggested that the boundary of self versus nonself is less rigidly drawn and that
significant others are important components of the self (Hsu, 1981; Sampson,
1988). This suggests that there are multiple dimensions of identity.


In this model, the individual is embedded in a network of social relationships
and obligations that play a primary role in determining behavior. For example,
Asian individuals make more "collective" self-statements than "private" statements
about themselves in comparison to European and North American individuals
(Higgins &amp; King, 1981). Triandis (1989) noted that the Asian self depends
more on the situation and the values of the group than does the Caucasian self.
Asian Americans tend to respond strongly to the judgments and demands of the
social environment, taking into consideration external influences more than self-assessments
and individual motives (Yeh &amp; Huang, 1994). This collectivist approach
to development and its resulting behavior is an important cultural
contribution to adaptation by Asian American families.


Harrison et al. (1990) regarded ancestral worldviews, rooted in spirituality/
religiosity and philosophical orientation, as another adaptive strategy used by
ethnic minority families. These worldviews provide a framework for coping with
contemporary life situations. For API Americans, traditions offer a prescription for
living and adherence to codes of behavior. These comfortable cultural traditions
offer stability in a new country that often is confusing and difficult to understand.

<b>FAMILY SOCIALIZATION OF
IDENTITY FORMATION AND LIFE SKILLS</b>


<i><b>Identity</b></i>


A critical family function is its role in identity formation and development
of critical life skills to produce successful family members. The formation and
reworking of certain parts of identity is an ongoing task from birth to death
within a familial and sociocultural context (Erikson, 1968). The critical period
in which humans form a solid, enduring identity typically is during adolescence
into early adulthood (Erikson, 1950). The development of a coherent self-identity
is more complex for API adolescents, as visible racial/ethnic minorities, who must
resolve conflicts among competing cultural values (Ross-Sheriff, 1992) as well as
cope with prejudice and discrimination that affect their identity and self-esteem
(Canino &amp; Spurlock, 1994).


Commitment to an ethnic identity is considered an important factor contributing
to positive adjustment, ego identity, and self-esteem among adolescents and
college students of minority status in the United States (Phinney, 1992; Phinney
&amp; Alipuria, 1990; Phinney &amp; Chavira, 1992; Phinney, Lochner, &amp; Murphy, 1990).
API families have a significant role in teaching children and adolescents about
the strengths of their cultural heritage. Findings by Rosenthal and Feldman (1992)
suggested that a warm family environment consisting of explicit rules, control,
and encouragement of autonomy predicted ethnic pride but not ethnic knowledge.
Ethnic behavior and knowledge were thought to be influenced by specific
parental practices. Okano and Spilka (1971) showed that parents serving as ethnic
role models for adolescents did not adequately account for ethnic identification
of second- and third-generation Japanese Americans. Aside from these studies,
there is little research examining how familial or parental interactions affect the
formation of the ethnic identity of API adolescents (Serafica, 1990). Hence, more
research is needed to further elucidate how parents can promote ethnic identification
in API adolescents.


<i><b>Autonomy and Family Dependence</b></i>


Rapid physical growth and sexual maturation during puberty propel the identity
formation process as well as increased autonomy from the family during
adolescence (Preto, 1988). The developmental task for Asian American adolescents
is to develop a sense of autonomy and competence within the context of
maintaining close relationships with the family. The available literature indicates
that Asian American parents tend to be more restrictive of their children's independence
in social activities and occupational choices (Yao, 1985a) but foster early
independence in the academic area (Lin &amp; Fu, 1990) compared to Caucasian
American parents. Uba (1994) noted that acculturated Chinese and Japanese

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many API adolescents experience an increased awareness of their racial/ethnic
group status (Sata, 1983) with poorer body image and self-image that can intensify
self-consciousness in the presence of the opposite sex (Chen &amp; Yang, 1986). The
authors interpret this finding as suggestive of a negative impact of racial stereotyping
on self-concept. The impact of families in soliciting positive self-concepts
and body images for APIs must be investigated.


The empirical literature (e.g., Han, 1985; Nguyen &amp; Williams, 1989) has
identified larger emotional and communicational gaps between API adolescents
and parents as compared to their Caucasian American counterparts. These intergenerational
gaps are attributed to differential acculturation rates and limited
proficiency in the Asian language. McDermott et al. (1983) reported that Japanese
American parents in Hawaii endorsed the value of the family as a reference group
for decision making, fulfillment of family obligations, clear lines of authority,
and open sharing among members, whereas adolescents emphasized the need for
privacy of thoughts and feelings except to express anger. Immigrant and second-generation
Chinese, Filipino, and Vietnamese American adolescents reported greater
reliance on the family as a source of support, advice, and guidance than did their
Euro-American counterparts (Cooper, Baker, Polichar, &amp; Welsh, 1993). These
adolescents turned to siblings and age peers in discussing sexuality, dating, and
marriage. Likewise, Han (1985) noted that Korean American adolescents disclosed
the most to their same-sex peers, whereas Caucasian American adolescents
disclosed the most to their mothers.


The process of immigration or resettlement during adolescence can exacerbate
normal developmental struggles with identity, self-concept, and generational
conflicts with parents (Ho, 1992). Not only do API adolescents encounter highly
disparate social norms in the United States, but they are vulnerable to changing
social norms within their own families (Uba, 1994). They are actively exploring roles
and behaviors of the American culture, redefining their values and self-concepts,
and renegotiating social roles and family relationships (Huang, 1989). The developmental
task of forging their own identity and acquiring a sense of autonomy
can be particularly challenging in the context of Asian family norms of filial obedience
and family interdependence coupled with American societal goals of verbal
assertiveness, individualism, and independence (Nagata, 1989). Immigrant parents
commonly instill a desire for maintenance of language and traditions in their
adolescent children (Huang, 1989). Adolescent-parent conflicts in immigrant
families are further exacerbated by disruption of roles associated with hierarchical
family structure including parent-child role reversal (Ho, 1987). Out of helplessness
and frustration, parents might increase discipline as a reaction to restore
traditional family roles. Internal and intergenerational conflict might manifest in its
most extreme forms as gang involvement, substance use, and delinquency (Furuto
&amp; Murase, 1992).

<b><i>Language Acquisition</i></b>


It is generally believed that language acquisition occurs through the socialization
process, resulting primarily from social interaction. One's primary language
derives from interactions with significant others in a child's earliest social
interactions (usually the parents). In extended family situations, multiple adult
caretakers might influence language development. For example, in households
of multiple generations, grandparents might be the primary caretakers and interact
with the child in their native language. In preschool years, the child might
be non-English speaking and then acquire English with the emergence from the
home setting. Language is an implicit vehicle of cultural transmission and cultural
identity.


Research on children's acquisition of bilingualism indicates that children associate
languages with the people who commonly speak to them and situations
in which they are used (McClure, 1981). In a study of bilingual socialization,
Kuo (1974) found that children tended to be more proficient in Chinese than in
English when the general language orientation of the family was Chinese (i.e.,
when parents used Chinese in conversation and when reading stories to children).
The children tended to be more proficient in English when parents were naturalized
citizens, when parents had resided longer in the United States, and when
more American food was served in the family. Kuo's study suggested that the
family had a strong impact on the Chinese language competence of children rather
than inhibiting children's English proficiency. The age of the children was correlated
with English proficiency, suggesting that as a child gets older and extra
familial contacts become more important, the relative impact of the family on
language socialization tends to decline.


Family extendedness also plays a role in language acquisition in that different
generations in the household may exert different language preferences. Unfortunately,
the literature has not systematically investigated the relationship of multigenerational,
multilingual families and language proficiency outcomes. Anecdotally,
the combination of monolingual parents or grandparents and bilingual children may
upset the traditional role configuration within the family as children more easily
communicate with the outside world and become spokepersons for their families.
A child's language preference might reflect cultural identification or more normative
developmental issues such as compliance with or rejection of parental
expectations.


<b><i>Schooling and Achievement</i></b>


With entry into school, children are confronted by a myriad of new challenges
and opportunities. Much of children's earlier dependence on the family and home
environment needs to be relinquished, and attention must be redirected to unfamiliar
adults. Successful transition to the school environment and academic

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Depending on the ethnic composition of their neighborhood or preschool
experiences, entry into schooling might be children's first formal contact with a
culture different from the home. As such, it presents one of the earliest occasions
for possible cultural clash and for emergence of biculturalism as an adaptive strategy.
A discontinuity between home and school might result in differing contextual
demands, requiring children to develop new modes of interacting and behaving.
Holliday (1985) observed that the discontinuity between home and school facilitated
the development of situational problem solving among these children.
Young Asian American children negotiate between the sometimes conflicting and
sometimes compatible expectations or cultural styles required in the two settings
(Huang &amp; Ying, 1989). Ethnic minority families are bicultural in terms of different
culturally determined patterns for dealing with the public versus private domains
of family life. In a comparison of child-rearing practices among Chinese, immigrant
Chinese, and Caucasian American parents, Lin and Fu (1990) found that
the Chinese groups adapted to necessary changes while maintaining certain traditional
family values. For example, these parents had higher ratings on parental
control and more of an emphasis on achievement, consistent with traditional
Confucian values, than did Caucasian American parents. However, contrary to
expectations and previous research, these parents had higher ratings on encouragement
of independence in school and achievement domains. This combination
of values facilitated a bicultural socialization that enabled these immigrant children
to function effectively in both cultures. Degree of acculturation, adherence
to ancestral world values, and balancing of American individuality with Asian
collectivity each contributed to strategies developed by these children.


Much of the research on academic achievement by Asian American children
has focused on Asian cultural values that promote educational endeavors (Sue
&amp; Okazaki, 1990). Asian families teach children the importance of repaying parents
for their sacrifices, and one highly valued path is through high educational
achievement. The achievement success of Japanese Americans is attributed to the
compatibility of Japanese and American cultural/familial values. Lee (1987),
Mordkowitz and Ginsburg (1987), and Yao (1985b) all attempted to delineate
specific family characteristics associated with successfully achieving Asian American
students. They concluded that a strong home environment with strict monitoring
of children's free time, investment in educational opportunities, and parental
emphasis on respect for education and expectation of achievement were correlated
with high academic achievement.


In a study of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean American 6th and 7th graders,
Lee (1987) found that Asian American parents held higher educational expectations
for their children than did White parents and were reinforced by teacher
and peer perceptions. Campbell and Mandel (1990) concluded that ethnicity
directly influenced parental behavior, which in turn influenced achievement. In
contrast to Caucasian parents, who provided less pressure but more psychological

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A large, comprehensive survey study of 536 school-age children from low-income
Southeast Asian refugee families examined factors that contribute to school
achievement (Caplan, Choy, &amp; Whitmore, 1992). A factor analysis of a values
rating scale indicated that parents and children honor mutual collective obligation
to each other and to the extended family and strive to attain respect, cooperation,
and harmony within the family. One of the most powerful predictors of academic
performance is adherence to the belief that the "past is as important as the future."
This supports the notion that ancestral worldviews may be an adaptive strategy
used by ethnic minority families in dealing with contemporary life challenges
(Harrison et al., 1990). In this study of Vietnamese refugees, the value of studying
and learning was reinforced at home and in school.


In a further analysis, Dornbusch, Prescott, and Ritter (1987) used Baumrind's
(1971) typology of parental authority to attempt to explain different achievement
outcomes. Results from students of African American, Mexican American, and
White families confirmed the hypothesis that high authoritarian (or permissive)
parenting was related to lower grades and that authoritative parenting was associated
with higher grades. Parental authority type did not appear to play a role
in predicting academic achievement among Asian American children; rather, ancestral
worldviews such as reciprocating parents' sacrifices by doing well in school,
positive teacher expectations (Wong, 1980), and cultural attributions of effort
as the primary factor responsible for successful learning (Stevenson &amp; Stigler,
1992) were more important predictors.


Asian American children are socialized to the value that their performance,
whether laudable or disappointing, reflects family upbringing and brings pride
or disgrace to the family name. This socialization process has transcended American
generations in the United States. Asian and Asian American families emphasize
educational achievement to a greater extent, have higher educational and occupational
aspirations, and exert much more parental control and supervision over
youths' academic and social affairs than do Caucasian American families (Lin &amp;
Fu, 1990; Sata, 1983; Sollenberger, 1968; Sung, 1990; Uba, 1994; Yao, 1985b).
One developmental task of API adolescents is to fulfill their filial responsibility
of academic excellence to enhance family honor (Serafica, 1990) and to take
advantage of occupational opportunities to further enhance the social standing
and economic well-being of the entire family (Uba, 1994).


For Asian immigrant and refugee children, the pressure to succeed academically
is intense because families assume that academic achievement ultimately
will bring success and upward mobility to the family. Interestingly, the intensity
of this value appears to diminish through acculturation. Studies indicate that
more recent immigrants or less acculturated Asian American students do better
on academic measures than do their more acculturated peers (Dornbusch et al.,
1987).


Slaughter-Defoe, Nakagawa, Takanishi, and Johnson (1990) noted a model
minority myth that emphasized only academic and educational successes of Asian

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A cultural ecological approach has identified variables significantly associated
with academic achievement among Asian Americans: individual, family and parent,
and teacher and school variables. What is lacking in the research is identification
of academic risk factors among API American children. In current literature,
there is strong support for biculturalism, rather than assimilation, as an adaptive
strategy prerequisite for success and academic achievement in this society.


<b><i>Occupational Achievement</i></b>


Preparing for and launching one's career is an important developmental task
for API adolescents and young adults. Adequate preparation and launching a
career successfully help API young adults fulfill their filial obligations (Uba, 1994).
Although it is a critical life task, Leong (1991) noted few studies on career development
of Asian and Pacific Americans.


The enculturation of certain intellectual and behavioral skills, valued by families
and reinforced by Asian culture through the educational system, can produce
the occupational segregation found among APIs in the United States. The pattern
of occupational segregation of Asian American males into scientific or technical
fields, and the avoidance of vocations requiring strong verbal skills or social interaction,
can be understood within the framework of the API's ethnic identity
and Asian cultural values emphasizing formality in relationships, restraint and
inhibition of strong feelings, and obedience to authority (Sue, 1973) as well as
differential rates of acculturation and historical and political factors (Sue &amp; Kirk,
1973). "Glass ceilings" (Leong &amp; Hayes, 1990), culturally preferred leadership
styles Qames, Chen, &amp; Cropanzano, 1996), and occupational segregation have
serious implications for financial success and API family roles into the next century

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Asian Americans have a preference for a collectivistic rather than an individualistic
orientation in career decision making and in problem-solving approach
(Leong, 1991). API families, especially immigrant families, exercise authority in
supervising and making unilateral decisions concerning the API's academic and
career goals, with a preference for occupations in medicine, physical science, and
business (Uba, 1994). Data on Asian American college students reveal that an
individualistic achievement style is related to endorsement of both Asian and
Anglo values, whereas collectivistic achievement orientation is marginally associated
with endorsement of Asian values (Lew, 1994).


Across many Asian ethnic groups, families continue to retain important influence
and decision-making power over college selection and career decisions
for young adults. Second-generation Korean Americans, for example, exhibit
career choices involving prestigious professional occupations consistent with parental
values of success (Kim, 1993). We can anticipate that Asian American families
will continue to expect high career aspirations for young adults but that more
acculturated families may permit greater input by young adults in career selection
in an expanded range of acceptable career choices.


<b>SOCIAL AND KIN-KEEPING TASKS OF
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER FAMILIES</b>


Another critical family function is development of social skills and fulfillment of
kin-keeping tasks for survival, maintenance, and socialization of API family members.
This section describes how API families socialize their youngest members
to engage in critical social and kin-keeping tasks throughout the life course.


<b><i>Adaptive Function of Emotions in
Asian and Pacific Islander Family Life</i></b>


Within nurturant family environments, socialization can most effectively enhance
survival of family members and facilitate coping with normative and nonnormative
life transitions by providing possible scripts for behaviors among
younger generations that have proved to be adaptive in cultural, family, and personal
history. Cultures vary in use of specific motivational strategies to maintain
family solidarity. Nydegger (1983) found that use of emotional tenor in the family
might not be a very good predictor of family cohesion. Americans use positive
emotions to cement familial bonds. Feelings are very powerful in motivating people's
behaviors. The inherent difficulty in using this motivational strategy is that
emotions are volatile and can be switched off or reassigned more quickly. Relying
solely on positive emotions as the glue to hold families together can create fragile

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emotions are a critical basis for all social relationships and have special implications
for maintenance of lifelong family relationships. Emotions and their
expression are critical moderators of stress behavioral reactions. Expression of
emotions, communication patterns, and cultural use of confessionals and disclosure
have clear implications for API families. Kitayama and Markus (1994b) described
the impact of culture on the expression of emotion and social relationships.
How emotions are formulated, are expressed, and moderate behaviors has significant
implications for API families because these cultural features temper the
modes of relating to other family members and the environment (Frijda &amp; Mesquita,
1994). For instance, the suppression of negative emotional expression might actually
enhance the stability and socially supportive nature of API families. However,
suppression of positive emotional expression, such as verbal praise for
successes, might produce APIs who lack confidence in abilities or produce
lowered self-esteem (Stevenson &amp; Stigler, 1992).


The work of Kitayama and Markus (1994a) suggested that culture might not
be static; rather, it might be dynamic and responsive to a rapidly changing environment,
as within the same generation or across one generation. Accordingly,
culture and its tenets are customized and personalized by the individual to make
social situations and the world meaningful within a particular time and place
and, hence, may change over the life cycle. The work of Nagata (1993) demonstrated
that internment during World War II systematically and profoundly
changed Japanese American families, particularly the Issei and Nisei generation.
Many Issei never recovered economically or spiritually after their release from
camps. Even third-generation Japanese Americans, who had not directly experienced
internment, nevertheless had been transformed by their families' perceptions
regarding the values of life, liberty, and justice. There has been a conspiracy
of silence concerning this trauma among Issei in the Japanese American community.
Nagata (1993) identifies this conspiracy of silence as a coping mechanism
to avoid additional racism, avoid the appearance of being un-American, avoid
traumatic memories, or protect their children. In fact, during congressional redress
hearings, internment victims often spoke of their experiences for the first
time in 40 years.


Several Pacific Islander groups—<i>Kwara'ae</i> and <i>A'ara</i> speakers among Solomon
Islanders in Melanesia, Hawaiians, and Nukulaelae Islanders of Polynesia
(White &amp; Watson-Gegeo, 1990)—believe that illness or misfortune may be brought
about by engaging in unpleasant or troubling thoughts and feelings. By contrast,
the Ifaluk of Micronesia believe that by engaging in direct verbal expression of
emotions, one can avoid illness (Lutz, 1988). The expression of emotions and
its relationship to social processes or health is by no means homogeneous among
Pacific Islanders. The use of confession and disclosure as a mechanism for symbolic

In an anthropological analysis of <i>ho'oponopono</i>, Shook (1985) found that
this traditional Hawaiian family problem-solving process had universal relevance
yet particular efficacy with native Hawaiian families. This Hawaiian conflict resolution
process was led by a family elder or respected outsider such as a healer. A
prayer asked God for assistance, and a blessing started this process. During the
problem identification phase, the leader was responsible for reaching resistant
family members and fully engaging them in the process. A review of the
ho'oponopono procedures and sequence was outlined. There was a discussion
of thoughts and feelings by all members of the family in a calm manner so that
all members could be heard. There was a pooling of family strengths to solve the
family problem. During the resolution phase, exchanges of confession and forgiveness
and release of the family problem were made. During the closing session,
a summary of transpired events and spiritual and individual thanks were made.
This traditional family conflict resolution process had fallen into disuse with the
acculturation of Hawaiians. It currently is experiencing a cultural resurgence.


<b><i>Family Extendedness</i></b>


Types of family structures, developed in particular environmental niches
around the world, appear to be maintained in a new culture if it serves a useful
function. Various types of family structures exist in ethnic minority communities,
but a common form is the extended family system.


Traditional Asian families have been characterized by a system of hierarchical
roles based on age, birth position, and gender. Within this extended family system,
the privileges, obligations, and responsibilities of each role are clearly delineated
according to a vertical structure. In many instances, multiple generations and
multiple caretakers reside within one household. For some immigrant families,
a significant family member might remain in the country of origin. Although not
physically present, this member might exert a psychological presence and contribute
to family decision-making processes in absentia. With increasing acculturation,
the form of the extended family has evolved. Shared households may
be replaced by individual family units. However, decision-making, resource allocation,
and role relationships still may be determined by the hierarchical structure
in the extended family. Although members of the family might leave the
family and kinship group for specific purposes, they often are expected to return
to this innermost family circle. The primary importance of the kinship relationship
supersedes development of ties to other groups, organizations, or individuals.
Even with marriage, it is assumed that the spouse and the spouse's family will be
incorporated within this family boundary (Hsu, 1981). Thus, familial and social
behaviors are governed by respect for the hierarchy of roles and the value of filial
piety (Tseng, 1973). API family interactional patterns and socializing principles
support avoidance of personal confrontations to produce smooth interpersonal
relationships (Agbayani-Siewert &amp; Revilla, 1995; Yee &amp; Hennessey, 1982).

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Pacific Islanders share many similar family values with Asian families, but
the specific manner in which these values manifest varies across Pacific Islander
families. Although nurturance of Hawaiian children and food preparation were
primarily the responsibility of women, grandparents frequently raised children.
The custom of <i>hanai</i>, giving one or more children to members of the older generation
or to a female relative who could not have children, was common. This
custom developed from the belief that the grandparent or adult role would be
incomplete and would create loneliness if grandparents or adults were unable to
raise children as a significant part of their family function. The oldest woman in
the Hawaiian family (<i>ohana</i>) presided over the family. This family matriarch was
responsible for preservation of tradition and for maintaining harmony in the
family. If a family conflict arose, then the matriarch and patriarch presided over
a Hawaiian family problem-solving process called ho'oponopono (Ogawa, in press).
It is a method for restoring harmony and maintenance of good relationships between
family members and the family with supernatural powers (Pukui &amp; Elbert,
1971).


The Hawaiian extended family is central to Hawaiian culture; children are
highly desired, are indulged, and often are the center of attention. Toddlers are
expected to begin assuming family responsibilities, and older siblings care for
younger children. These child-rearing strategies foster interdependence and increased
opportunities for children to exercise adult roles as part of their family
duties. According to Shook (1985), the Hawaiian family can be described as "benevolent
authoritarianism" with the elders (<i>kupunas</i>) acting as teachers of the
children. Learning is gained by observation and through experience. Sibling cooperation
and conflict avoidance with adults are encouraged as primary coping
strategies (Gallimore, Boggs, &amp; Jordan, 1974). All socialization practices reinforce
the value of affiliation. Cooperation (<i>laulima</i>) and help (<i>kokua</i>) reflect this
cultural value of interdependence. A mature Hawaiian person is achieved when
he or she can accurately perceive and attend to another person's needs, often
without being asked (Shook, 1985).


The affiliative nature of interpersonal relations is a central theme in the Hawaiian
identity and socialization (Ito, 1985). The generous giving of the self is
viewed as an altruistic exchange to maintain affiliative bonds. According to Ito
(1985), this is not a reciprocal exchange; rather, it is a generalized exchange in
which <i>aloha</i> and goodwill can be extended by one family member and could be
returned through a number of affiliative ties with others in that family. Exchanges

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As an adaptive strategy, reliance on the Hawaiian extended family has led to
a greater sense of interdependence, a greater focus on group goals, and less emphasis
on individuality and individual needs. With increased acculturation, however,
the extended family may be experienced as a strength for some members
but as a restriction in autonomy.


Certain features of the Samoan kinship system have been retained in the
United States such as the temporary financial and material support to new immigrants
from the homeland. In a study of the largest overseas community of
Samoans living in Southern California (Shu, 1985-1986), nearly 88% of interviewed
Samoans wanted their elderly parents or relatives to live with them under
all circumstances. However, because only 3.8% of all respondents were age 60
years or older, very few Samoans actually had elderly relatives living in the household.


Chain migration of young relatives was very high, with 42% of respondents
acknowledging the presence of kin living in the household. Kin provided living
accommodations after migration from Samoa and helped with employment referral.
It appears that the presence of kin is a source of social support but can
lead to both financial and social stress for Samoans. Janes (1990) found that two
types of life events cause Samoans concern: life events that upset daily routines
of life and demand extraordinary attention or monetary expenses and life events
that affect relationships within the immediate or extended family. Samoans lacked
the economic resources to cope with economic crises because nearly one third
of those in Janes's sample were below the poverty level.


Fujita and O'Brien (1991) found a persistence of traditional social relationships
across Japanese American generations. In a survey of 490 second-and third-generation
Japanese Americans in California from 1979 to 1990, Fujita and O'Brien
found that involvement with Japanese voluntary associations, such as <i>tanomoshi</i>
or rotating credit associations, served to reinforce <i>iemoto</i> or cultural origin of
the household. This reinforcement of the mutually dependent hierarchical relationships
in the Japanese community and family served to buffer against assaults
coming from outside this community and strengthened ethnic solidarity. Tamura
(1994) argued that Nisei Japanese Americans may be more direct, aggressive,
and individualistic in public or among Caucasian Americans but very traditional,

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Sibling Relationships</i></b>


Another critical socialization function of families is to enhance social and
kin-keeping skills among younger family members. These social skills enhance
their ability to adapt and function in important social spheres while traversing
developmental transitions over the life course. Sibling relationships are learning
and testing grounds for practicing and sharpening social skills. Siblings also provide
a source of conflict, as seen in studies of sibling rivalry during childhood,
but can be a great source of support and comfort over a lifetime. The source of
its power is poorly understood, but the impact of negative sibling interaction
might have a more dramatic impact on the family than does the impact of any
other social relationship (Basic Behavioral Science Task Force of the National
Advisory Mental Health Council, 1996).


Cicirelli (1994) suggested that the nature of sibling relationships crossculturally
and among minority groups in the United States is notably distinct
from the Caucasian American pattern. He argued that these differences are reflected
in the way in which siblings are defined, cultural norms regulating sibling
role responsibilities and behaviors, the nature and extent of sibling caregiving
and socialization, the specific nature of sibling relationships, and variability of
sibling behaviors. For instance, Seymour (1993) found sibling caretaking typical
of South Asian societies, where older siblings care for younger siblings and teach
them survival skills such as personal self-care and domestic or occupational skills.
Older siblings were provided parent training skills and served as insurance against
early parental death. Sibling caretaking also may have adaptive value in singleparent
or dual-career households, in families that cannot afford babysitting expenses,
and in families that do not have adult extended family members to provide
these services. Sibling caregiving has been transplanted by API families in the
United States but has not been examined systematically.


Cicirelli (1994) found that sibling relationships were discretionary among
industrialized societies, whereas they were obligatory in nonindustrialized societies
or among more traditional minority groups in the United States. Maintenance
of sibling relationships in industrialized societies is largely volitional, with a weak
norm for close contact with siblings. The majority of adult siblings keep in touch

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

API sibling relationships must be examined because they are one of the longest
types of family relationships that humans may have. Research among older adults
shows that positive sibling relationships can be a tremendous source of support
during later life. More research must be done to examine the impact of sibling
relationships over the life course in API communities.


<b><i>Peer Interaction</i></b>


During the elementary school years, children's interactions with peers become
increasingly important and broaden the range of interpersonal relationships
beyond the family. From these interactions, API children develop new perceptions
of themselves, different social skills, and varied coping strategies for dealing with
social stressors. The social skills, role relationships, patterns of communication,
and language usage as established in the home might require modification to be
effective with these children's peer group. Children receive feedback from their
peers as to the success or failure of their social interventions.


The level and type of discontinuity between family and peer values offers
opportunities and challenges for the child. Adopting a bicultural adaptive strategy
enables the child to move fluidly between the cultures of the family and the peer
group by using the cultural behaviors most appropriate to the situation. Whereas
dutiful, attentive, respectful behavior is practiced in the home, the Asian child
might join in more noisy, playful, boisterous behavior with his or her peers. The
competent bicultural child is able to assess the situation and select behaviors appropriate
to the context.


For some children, there might be little discontinuity between values of the
family culture extending to the peer culture. A study of the Hawaiian culture
found that noncompetitive, affiliative patterns of interrelationships among Hawaiians
were pervasive (Howard, 1974; Howard &amp; Associates, 1971). The family
socialization patterns deemphasized individual competitive behavior and stressed
the social values of peer group affiliation and cooperation across generations in
the family and in peer groups. Developmentally, the peer group served to reinforce
the cultural value of collectivity. However, more studies must examine how discouragement
of individually competitive behavior in academic performance by
Hawaiian children relates to their lifelong achievements and development of resiliencies.
Unlike their Asian peers, who may be more academically assertive at
school, many Hawaiian children have not adapted their behaviors to these Westernized
academic settings. Both familial and social support networks must reinforce
the idea that education is an effective adaptive tool for life, but they also
must use culturally competent motivational strategies, such as the strong Hawaiian

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hirayama (1985) looked at teachers' and students' assessments of Hmong,
Vietnamese, and Korean students' relationships with American peers. More than
half of the teachers thought that Asian students were well accepted by their American
peers; the remainder thought that they were accepted with some distance.
However, 63% of the students reported that "American students are mean to
me," and of the 18% who disliked school, two of the main reasons were "being
insulted or laughed at by classmates" and "not having friends in school." When
interviewed about leisure time, 91% of the Asian students reported having friends
among their own nationality; 50% of the Korean and Vietnamese students and
10% of the Hmong students had close American friends whom they spent time
with outside of school. These parents have much control over whom their children
spend time with and how much time the children spend with peers. Inclusion of
school classmates in leisure activities appears to lessen school isolation and ostracism
felt by many API children.


Managing peer interactions is a critical developmental task. Peers serve as
an important reference group and contribute to a child's development of social
competence and self-esteem. For the Asian American child, the discontinuities
between family and peer group may result in different developmental outcomes.
A bicultural adaptive strategy juxtaposes two cultures by enhancing flexibility in
choices across values, identity, and behavioral domains as in coping strategies
used to negotiate peer stressors and relationships (Huang, Leong, &amp; Wagner,
1994).


<b><i>Intimacy</i></b>


Salient developmental tasks for API young adults include intimacy and commitment
to a love relationship that establishes an individual's path toward greater
financial and emotional independence from his or her family of origin. Commitment
to a love relationship can lead to a traditional Asian adult goal of marriage
and children to ensure survival of the family.


Families with strong ethnic identification may encourage dating and commitment
to individuals within one's ethnic group, emphasizing continuing the
family line (especially for males) and saving face. Immigrant families might perceive
interracial dating and marriage as a loss of culture and going against filial
piety. The flexibility and particular style of problem solving in the family will
exert a powerful influence on the individual's management of this developmental
phase (Serafica, 1990).


One area of frequent cultural conflicts between API adolescents and foreignborn
parents pertains to dating (Yu &amp; Kim, 1983). Asian immigrant parents tend
to be more restrictive about allowing adolescents, and especially females, to date
(Ho, 1992). One study (Feldman &amp; Rosenthal, 1990) reports significantly older
age expectations for heterosexual contacts (i.e., dating or participating in an overnight
trip with mixed-sex friends) among first- and second-generation Chinese

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mok (1995) found that the likelihood of dating Caucasians by Asian American
college students was higher with acculturation, perceiving Caucasians as more
attractive than Asians, and interracial dating experiences. The likelihood of dating
other Asian American college students was higher when related to higher Asian
ethnic identity, percentage of Asian friends, parental influences, and growing up
in high Asian ethnically dense neighborhoods. Her study suggests that the family,
likelihood of past and current proximity, and dating experiences have affected
dating patterns.


Fujino (1992) modified the exchange theory to examine the impact of ethnicity
and gender on Asian American heterosexual relationships. She found that
the motives for interracial dating mirror those found for interracial marriages.
In her college student sample of Americans of Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian
descent, Japanese out-dated more than did Chinese Americans, Caucasians exhibited
low rates of interracial dating, and women out-dated more than did men.
Physical attractiveness was valued more highly by men and Caucasian Americans.
Caucasians were considered more physically attractive, and Asians were regarded
as more caring. Critical variables were used in a predictive model for Asian Americans,
but the same model was not significant for Caucasians. The variable that
was unique for Asian Americans appeared to be propinquity, the availability of
possible API persons to date in their current lives. Limited support was found
for exchange interactions on interracial attraction. These studies suggest that the
influence of culture, gender, and social characteristics of the past and current
environments (i.e., availability of API dating and marital partners) has important
implications for dating, marriage, and patterns of API families.


<b><i>Gender Role Socialization</i></b>


Gender role socialization is another critical task of families. Gender roles
are influenced by traditional beliefs concerning the roles of men versus women
in the family. A Canadian study of South Asian women found that the impact of
acculturation on gender roles was multidimensional. Naidoo and Davis (1988)
found that South Asian Indian women were traditional in domains of home,
family, children, religion, and marriage but were contemporary with regard to
success, achievement, education, and aspirations for women and their daughters.
Acculturation was clearly domain and situation specific for South Asian women.
This study clearly suggests that multidimensional measurement tools are warranted

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Maintenance of familial continuity through the millennium is a traditional
Asian imperative and sometimes gets translated into a very strong sanction against
gay young adults because there is less likelihood of producing grandchildren as
the next generation. In addition, having a homosexual family member also might
bring shame to the family because this sexual orientation is very stigmatizing in
API communities (Hom, 1994). Interviews with Asian American parents of gay
children revealed that parental attitudes regarding homosexuality before disclosure
or discovery of their children's sexual orientation can influence parents'
reactions. If Asian parents were aware of homosexuality in their native countries,
then this prior knowledge decreased the blaming of Westernization for this sexual
orientation. Many Asian American parents of gay adult children successfully
coped with this disclosure by viewing sexual orientation as a singular aspect of
their children, having open lines of communication, and believing that their relationships
remained the same in spite of the shame that can be induced by disclosure
in their ethnic communities.


Lesbian and bisexual South Asian women feel alienation and isolated from
their own families while fearing and feeling anxious about their ethnic communities'
detection of their sexual orientation (National Asian Women's Health Organization,
1996). These lesbian and bisexual South Asian women feel frustrated
that non-South Asian therapists lack cultural competence to understand the stigmatization
in South Asian cultures and fear lack of confidentiality with South
Asian therapists.


<b><i>Marriage</i></b>


Marriage is a critical decision in the lives of many APIs because it has direct
implications for the maintenance of the family and culture across generations.
Within the traditional Asian framework, marriage does not mark the creation of
a new family; rather, it marks the continuation of the husband's family line (Ho,
1987). In traditional API families, other family members have a central role in
mate selection in contrast to the secondary role found in Western societies. This
central role has diminished with acculturation, but API families still yield strong
but indirect influence over selection of mates. Culture exerts its influence in the
process of mate selection, marital rituals, marital satisfaction, and the manner in
which spousal or parental roles are negotiated and enacted (Ho, 1987). Marriage
based on love and mutual interests or compatibility has increasingly become a
norm for API young adults (Ho, 1987).


One clear example of how culture affects marrriage is found in the relative
timing of marriage among Hmong living in St. Paul, Minnesota. Hutchinson and
McNaII (1994) found that half of the female Hmong students were married by
their senior year in high school but that the majority remained in school. The
results indicated that early marriage had no significant negative effects because
few differences were found between married and unmarried Hmong females in

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite the importance of intimacy and commitment to love relationships
in young adulthood, there are few empirical studies of APIs. Traditional Asian
marital and parental roles are clearly defined by Confucian role definitions that
are patriarchal, with females at the bottom of the hierarchy (del Carmen, 1990).
API women from immigrant, working-class backgrounds tend to be less educated
and are reported to be more tradition bound in terms of their sex role orientation
(True, 1981). Disruptions in the family hierarchy, such as higher employment
status of the wife, might be perceived by the husband as a threat to his patriarchal
authority (Ho, 1987). Changes in social roles found among Southeast
Asian families were reported to result in more frequent marital conflicts, family
violence (wife or childabuse), depression, or alcoholism (Lin, Masuda, &amp; Tazuma,
1982). Renegotiation of roles and expectations in a new social context is particularly
difficult when some family members rigidly cling to traditional Asian
roles, communication patterns of indirectness, and prohibition in the expression
of emotions (Ho, 1987). Adaptive family development requires modifications of
roles, expectations, and behaviors to adjust to new and changing environmental
conditions.


API women with higher education and middle-class backgrounds might be
exposed to feminist ideas, egalitarian marital role attitudes, and expectations for
greater occupational mobility (Chow, 1985). Japanese American males were found
to be high on male-dominant, patriarchal attitudes pertaining to marital roles
(Arkoff, Meredith, &amp; Iwahara, 1964), whereas Japanese American females scored
higher on egalitarian conceptions of marriage and not significantly different from
Caucasian American females. There often is a gap between expression of egalitarian
attitudes or values and actual behavior. Even among Caucasian American
families who express egalitarian attitudes, women still have a disproportionate
share of the child and household responsibilities relative to time spent by the
husbands engaged in those tasks (see review in Schellenberger &amp; Hoffman, 1995).


A standard family studies mantra is that selection of marital partners is based
on similarity of key characteristics such as education, social class, religion, ethnicity,
cultural background, and values. It appears that choosing a marital partner
from one's own ethnic group might be less important after the first immigrant
generation; however, understanding various factors that lead to selection of a
marital partner is far from simple. Shinagawa (1996) reported that 31.2% of API
husbands (19.0% interethnic and 12.3% interracial, with 9.9% to non-Hispanic
Whites) and 40.4% of API wives (16.6% interethnic and 24.2% interracial, with
20.0% to non-Hispanic Whites) intermarried, according to the 1990 U.S. census.
Japanese Americans, with a significant number of wives married to U.S. servicemen
(51.9%), and Filipino American wives (40.2%) account for the highest proportion
of intermarriages among APIs. Marriage patterns among California APIs

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fong and Yung (1995-1996) interviewed Chinese and Japanese Americans
born in the 1940s to 1950s cohort who had married Caucasian Americans. These
authors suggested that although decreasing racial barriers and acculturation can
facilitate intermarriage to Caucasian Americans, other factors also must be considered.
Aversion to Asian patriarchy, overbearing Asian mothers, cultural and
economic compatibility, upward mobility, and media representations of beauty
and power contribute to the increasing intermarriages between Asian and Caucasian
Americans. Proximity in school or work was a precondition to marrying
on the basis of compatibility, love, and trust. Timing and availability of Asian
American partners of the same ethnicity are critical when the individual feels
ready to be married. For API women, the childbearing clock often is a factor.
Geographic area has an impact on availability of potential Asian American marital
partners. Cultural affinity—whether one's cultural/family background values
strong family ties, ethnic traditions, and educational achievement—could lay a
strong foundation for marriage and family. In Fong and Yung's sample, Jewish
partners and the Hawaiian connection facilitated interracial marriages. An aversion
for marrying within the same ethnicity, such as disliking some aspects of
one's own culture, contributed to marrying a White spouse. Some of the same
factors that impinged on selection of marital partners among the general population
also affected APIs, such as similarity of core values and proximity. Yet,
there are some unique API differences such as wanting to avoid traditional marriages
of their parents and being repelled from others of the same culture because
of a dislike for Asian patriarchy.


As in other API family research areas, there are both push and pull factors
for marrying from within one's ethnic group or selecting a marital partner from
outside one's ethnic community. For example, a surprising number of mates are
selected by advertisements, visits to India, and referrals from family, friends, and
marriage brokers among South Indian immigrants (Sheth, 1995) and South Indians
born in America, although for the latter group this is a less commonly used
mechanism to meet potential mates. Eligibility for permanent residency can
be an important reason for mate advertisements. Matrimonial candidates are
screened by relatives, and the engagement processes are supervised by parents
or relatives. It appears that caste and dowry considerations still are issues for
South Asian Indian immigrants and their families (Durvasulas &amp; Mylvaganam,
1994). This is a potential source of intergenerational conflict surrounding marriage
and the family.


The quality of marriages is influenced by the rules or norms of giving and
receiving benefits in marital relationships. For instance, providing benefits without
the expectation of repayment (i.e., for love and caring about the recipient of
benefits) as in communal relationships produced long-term improvements in marital

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ramola (1992) found changes in the division of labor and decision-making
power among immigrant South Indian Americans living in Chicago, but husbands
and wives did not want to give up their traditional gender roles. South Indian
wives were found to be more satisfied with their marriages than were their husbands,
and Ramola attributed this finding to the increased freedom of wives with
lessening of social control and authority of elders in the extended family.


Family adaptation often is dependent on the sociocultural context that has
different implications for each family member. Kim and Kim (1995) examined
Korean immigrant families and work roles in Chicago. They found that three
fourths of Korean immigrant wives were employed in contrast to traditional Korean
norms of married women as full-time homemakers. More than two thirds
of the dual-earner families did not accept the wives' work role. Nonacceptance
of working wives was even greater among single-earner families. In the dualearner
Korean families, spouses of both genders agreed that it was the wives'
responsibility to do the housework. In effect, Korean immigrant wives had a
culturally sanctioned "double shift" of paid work and unpaid work in the family.
The wives' voluntary obligation to take a double shift can be an adaptational
strategy for API families in which the husbands might have limited employment
opportunities and the wives work to produce or maintain high family incomes.
This Korean immigrant family pattern could be stress ridden and particularly
burdensome for wives.


Determinants of marital satisfaction can vary across cultures and the specific
ways in which marital satisfaction is expressed. Noda, Noda, and Clark (1990)
found that communication with a housewife's spouse was the primary determinant
of marital satisfaction and adjustment among Japanese immigrant housewives
living in Canada. Gender differences can be found in what determines
marital satisfaction, happiness, and well-being. For instance, according to Sasao
and Chun (1994), subjective well-being on psychological and physical dimensions
is higher if Korean women are married than if they are not. The frequency of
contact and support by their families was correlated to physical health for Korean
women. Happiness was related to how often Korean women saw their friends.
These findings are mirrored in the Caucasian family literature, but the impact of
culture and language might determine how often Korean women see their friends
and the composition of their friendship networks.


Similar to marriages among the general population, marital adjustment
among Koreans living in the United States is dependent on value congruence

Chan and Wethington (1995) argued that few studies have examined the
marital relationships among interracial couples, yet the literature has presumed
negative well-being and instability of such marriages. The presumption commonly
made about interracial couples or raising biracial and multiracial children
is that these families would be prone to difficulties. This negative attribution can
be linked to the inappropriate generalization of studies that typically examined
interracial marriages among newly arrived and less acculturated foreign-born
individuals who are less educated and have poor English-speaking abilities (Jeong
&amp; Schumm, 1990). These authors suggested that unique cultural resources and
strengths that are not available to other families might be mobilized by multicultural
families. Very little is known about these issues because current sampling
of ethnic identification often precludes identification of biracial and multiracial
status in marriage and divorce statistics.


Studies have suggested that spouses in interracial marriages tend to be older,
be more educated, and have higher incomes (Sung, 1990). These three factors
are demonstrated to contribute to higher marital stability in the general population
(White, 1990). Challenges faced by interracial couples are family opposition,
especially among immigrant generations (Lee &amp; Yamanaka, 1990), gender role
expectations (Chan, 1990), and difficulties that might arise from cultural conflicts
in parenting biracial children (Johnson &amp; Nagoshi, 1986). The more compatible
gender role expectations between marital partners, the more stability and satisfaction
is likely to occur in the marriage.


In traditional families, Asian males have the responsibility for continuing the
family lineage. Therefore, the impetus for traditional families is to encourage the
eldest males to marry within the cultural group to maintain family lineage. Because
daughters do not have this responsibility, their out-marriages might not be
opposed as readily (Chan, 1992). Family opposition toward a disliked in-law

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In an effort to disentangle the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on selectivity
of interracially married Asians, Hwang, Saenz, and Aguirre (1995) used
1980 U.S. census 5% public use microdata samples limited to Chinese, Filipino,
Japanese, Korean, Asian Indians, and Vietnamese. They found that Asian women
married to White men in this sample tended to have lower SES when compared
to their in-married counterparts. Asians with lower SES also were more likely to
marry members of other minority groups such as Blacks. Having higher SES did
not affect these Asians' tendency to out-marry interethnically, but it affected rates
of interracial marriages as opposed to marrying within their own groups. Asian
persons who married interracially tended to marry persons with an SES inferior
to their own. The authors argued that this tendency could be attributable to Asian
immigrants marrying lower SES minority persons as a convenient way in which
to obtain their green cards.


Agbayani-Siewert (1994) noted that Filipino marital relationships differ in
two ways from those of other Asian couples. Filipino families are based on egalitarian
rather than patrilineal principles, and that ancestry is traced across both
sides of the family in accordance with Spanish traditions. More consistent marital
expectations pose less variant marital roles and cultural shock for Filipino couples
in Western countries than for other Asian families. Another difference between
Filipino and other Asian families is Filipinos' strong Catholic beliefs regarding
male and female family roles. "Machismo" mannerisms and behaviors by Filipino
males or submissive behavior by females outside the family might be mere public
display, but behind family doors a more egalitarian relationship exists. This paradoxical
description must be examined more closely among Filipino marriages.
Similar to other Asian ethnicities, Filipino couples are described as "noncommunicative"
by not confronting each other, and marital difficulties are considered
private matters not to be disclosed in public. Public versus private discussions
and behaviors might be notably different in API families in contrast to Caucasian
American, middle-class families. We currently do not know the extent of this
discrepancy and how this issue might affect API family research.


<i><b>Parenting</b></i>


API cultures, families, and individuals have different definitions of what it
means to be a parent, mother, father, or surrogate parent. In Western societies,
the focus on parenting revolves around the role of mothers. In other countries,
parenting and socialization of children might be the responsibility of a whole
village rather than focus solely on mothers (Ambert, 1994). API families have a
broader range of adults and older children who might have responsibility for
what Americans define as parenting responsibilities. These varied parental definitions,
roles, and responsibilities systematically shape family processes. For example,
the mother role is the most important role for women in traditional Japan,

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

According to Serafica (1990), counseling API parents about their parenting
roles is a critical gap in our society. On the one hand, API parental doggedness
concerning education as a means of achieving success is adaptive, but not at the
cost of parents alienating their child or pushing the child to suicide because he
or she received a B in one academic subject. On the other hand, some of the
extreme rigidity concerning absolute parental authority until marriage may be
softened to gradual loosening of authority through adolescence to avoid adolescent
rebellion to extreme authoritarian parenting. This need is particularly critical
for immigrant parents who are coping with the rapid acculturation of their children,
with age and gender role shifts, while also coping with a sometimes hostile
American environment (Chan &amp; Leong, 1994; Yee, in press).


In a study of Vietnamese immigrant parent and college-age child relationships,
Dinh, Sarason, and Sarason (1994) found that Vietnamese-born college
students felt they had lower quality of parental relationships and were less socially
integrated than were American-born students. Vietnamese-born male college students
were at high risk for poor relationships with their fathers. Vietnamese mothers
perceived less social support than did their American counterparts. However,
social support was measured by the average number of potential providers of
support and might be problematic because it did not assess types of support or
the level of support provided. The conflict between parents and college-age children
centered around the view of the parents as being overprotective and controlling.
The quality of the Vietnamese father-son relationship appeared to be
negatively affected by acculturation.


Fathers can make a unique contribution in the lives of their children. Traditional
API culture has placed fathers as the family patriarchs, yet we know little
about how that traditional role has changed with acculturation in America
(Mirande, 1991). For example, in an agrarian society, property was passed along
the male line to ensure integrity of land to grow crops. When these economic
issues no longer press Asian families, lineage, inheritance, and filial piety can
change with demands of the new sociocultural context. We currently see variations
in how fathers carry out their role in API families. An economic push
requires mothers to work outside the home. Two family incomes are an economic
requirement for most API families, but whether fathers take on more child caretaking
and household tasks as a result of mothers working outside the home is
yet to be determined.


Marsella, Oliveira, Plummer, and Crabbe (1995) reported that Native Hawaiians
had the highest rate of pregnancy and births to unmarried mothers. Sufficient
attention to the impact of this single-parent status on family processes and
socialization of these Hawaiian children was examined by Thompson, McCubbin,
Thompson, and Elver (1995). These authors stated that the accumulation of family
life events or pressures that occurred in the preceding 12 months was the most

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We see changes in who takes responsibility for children and households as
well as changes in child socialization goals that are adaptations to new sociocultural
environments faced by API families in Western countries. Schneider,
Hieshima, Lee, and Plank (1994) found a retention of East Asian traditions such
as high educational expectations, respect for authority, and reliance on tacit understandings
between children and parents to monitor and motivate improvement
of educational performance by the children. In a high-context culture such as
traditional Japanese culture, shared meanings do not have to be explicitly expressed.
Japanese parents nurture empathy as the most important of moral values
in Japanese culture (Lebra, 1994). Socialization of children focuses on how well
the children demonstrate sensitivity to the needs, desires, and feelings of others
(Schneider et al., 1994). These characteristics are not verbally instilled but are
socialized by appropriate behavioral modeling demonstrated across family routines
and life domains by older family members. The focus of socialization comes
from example and behavior rather than being socialized through verbal commands.
Life's lessons are taught by living an exemplary life rather than by talking
about what exemplary living should be.


Extended family members have taken on traditional parenting roles for API
families in America. Tam and Detzner (1995) found that Chinese immigrant grandparents
provided critical child care services for families. After visiting, grandmothers
often would take their grandchildren back to Hong Kong. Grandparents acted
as surrogate parents, family historians, cultural gurus, mentors, and role models
in families, but geographic proximity and belief in the socializing ability of family
elders determined the extent of this grandparent role in Asian families. A barrier
to using grandparents as family resources stemmed from acculturated middle-generation
parents who did not want to impose parenting responsibilities on
their elderly parents. Other respondents believed that their elderly parents could
not provide the type of socialization that had relevance in this society or disagreed
with the child-rearing strategy. Differences in preferred socialization and social
control strategies can be a source of conflict between generations in the family.


Another adaptational strategy found among API families is inclusion of close
family friends to provide a protective supportive network typically provided by
large extended families. For example, compadre systems from the Spanish colonial

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i><b>Divorce</b></i>


Divorce makes the family situation more complicated because family lines
become blurred and discontinuous. Divorce is not very common except among
younger and acculturated APIs. Lind (1964) did a cohort analysis of interracial
marriage and divorce rates in Hawaii between 1958 and 1962. He found that
out-marriage divorce rates for Hawaiian, Korean, Puerto Rican, Filipino, and
Caucasian Americans were lower than those for individuals married to individuals
from their own ethnic group. Sanborn (1977) analyzed this same database and
found an increased divorce risk for Caucasian women married to Chinese or
Japanese American men. Blood (1969) attributed an increased divorced risk to
the gender role incompatibility between traditional Asian husbands and emancipated
Caucasian wives as a chief culprit for marital strife. The least divorce-prone
marriages in Hawaii were between Caucasian men and Puerto Rican or Filipino
American women. Lu (1982) found that traditional Chinese women had a lessened
risk for divorce because divorce was not considered a viable option for an
unhappy marriage.


In a longitudinal study of divorce in Northern California, 333 persons who
recently had filed for divorce were interviewed and followed over 3.5 years
(Chiriboga &amp; Catron, 1991). This data set contained 18 Asian American divorcees
(8 Chinese, 4 Japanese, and 6 Filipino Americans); of these, two thirds were
female and one third were male. Yee, Chiriboga, and Catron (1991) collapsed
these Asian American respondents into one group because samples were too small
to conduct analyses for each Asian group. These authors found that half of the
sample exhibited high symptomatology measured by the California Symptoms
Checklist-42 at baseline, with the symptomatology decreasing 3.5 years later for
Asian males only, from 9.0 to 5.4 symptoms. The number of symptoms reported
for Asian females remained about the same, changing only from 12.7 to 12.8
symptoms at follow-up. The long-term divorce adaptation implications for Asian
females appear to be much bleaker, and the study should be replicated with a
larger sample.


In a detailed analysis of childhood stressors among this sample of Asian divorcees,
Yee et al. (1991) found that they experienced higher stress in being required
to work during their younger years, had more parents who were divorced,
and experienced absence from their parents to a greater extent than did the Caucasian
divorcees. Asian divorcees experienced fewer arguments among family

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Parental identification has been found to play a critical role in divorce adjustment
among Caucasian divorcees. More than one half of the Asian divorcees
saw dissimilarity between either parent and themselves. According to Yee et al.
(1991), this might be due to a wide generation gap in ethnic and self-identification
between immigrant and American generations in API families. This wide generation
gap ultimately might contribute to poorer adaptation among Asian divorcees,
but it is unclear whether poor identification with parents or some other factor
directly caused poorer divorce adaptation.


Sheth (1995) found that South Indian Americans have the lowest divorce
rates in comparison to Chinese, Filipino, and Korean couples, according to U.S.
census data from 1993. The author attributed this lower rate of divorce among
South Indian Americans to stronger emphasis on marriage and family, divorce
stigma, and high socioeconomic background of these couples.


Fujita and O'Brien (1991) found that association with Japanese organizations
served to be a resource to the family during times of crisis and that these ethnic
affiliations were associated with a decreased incidence of divorce among Japanese
Americans. What must be examined more closely is whether close ties with
Japanese culture, as well as cultural variables, might be implicated as the critical
factors or whether some other moderating variable is accounting for the
lower divorce rate among more traditional Japanese couples. Having a good support
system that promotes marriage and is available during times of crises, such
as marital difficulties, is one of many moderating factors contributing to marriage
outcomes.


<b><i>Intergenerational Relationships</i></b>


One critical role that older generations play in the lives of API families is
social support and transmission of culture to younger members of the family. The
spirits of dead relatives were believed to dwell at the heart of the family and to
guide the behavior of each of its members. Each family member formed a link
with past and future generations. Family solidarity was the goal of maintaining
this historical continuity. Filial piety was paid to older members of the family
because they gave life to younger members and would join the family's ancestors
after death. In Asian American families, filial piety might no longer be the driving
force that binds families together, but reciprocity between generations such as

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The cultural clashes come not so much from the basic family values to provide
social support and transmission of culture as from the behavioral expressions of
those values. Common family disagreements arise from rapid shifts in family
roles and expectations surrounding fulfillment of the roles in a new cultural context
(Yee, 1997). Yee (1992) found that some elderly Vietnamese had difficulty
coping with their younger grandchildren's lack of socialization in expressing respect
and filial piety in the traditional manner. Traditional ways in which to address
respected family elders might not be used by younger Asians, and this is
taken as a lack of respect. Rather, the values of filial piety often are present, but
the manner in which it is demonstrated changes with acculturation. This synchrony
between cultural values and the behavioral expressions of those values
becomes less harmonious with acculturation, blending of families (i.e., marriages)
across generations, and time. Social status of Asian elderly remains long after the
social and contextual situation has shifted away from supporting traditional demonstrations
of filial piety. For example, contributions of Vietnamese elders might
be critical to family survival soon after immigration to the United Status because
they provide needed services such as child care and household maintenance while
adult children hold paying jobs or go on to further schooling (Yee, 1997), but
they might erode when family elders no longer can make these contributions or
when services no longer are needed.


Asian elders traditionally were authority figures who kept younger members
in line by threatening shame to the family if they were indiscreet. Elders were
looked up to, had control over the family purse, and had authority to make decisions
for each younger family member (Yee &amp; Hennessey, 1982). Asian elders
living in the United States often find themselves with less control, experience
role reversal, and, instead of controlling financial resources, might find themselves
to be totally dependent on their adult children for support.


The nature of intergenerational relationships and its cultural transmission
can be illustrated by the 60th birthday rituals celebrated among Japanese families.
Doi (1991) contended that the <i>Kanreki</i>, a traditional rite of passage to old age
at 60 years of age, had been adopted by the Nisei (second-generation, first American-born
Japanese) as a cultural response to the dilemmas of growing older in
urban America. Doi argued that this rite of passage has not been directly observed
by Sansei (third-generation Japanese American) adults but rather has been transmitted
to this generation symbolically. Nisei parents could not celebrate their
grandparents' 60th birthdays due to logistical barriers such as World War II and
their internment. Having to recover economically after being interned also prevented
the enactment of these celebrations. Issei (first-generation immigrant Japanese
American) could not be used as role models to help Nisei adjust to their old
age because life situations and circumstances were so different. Younger Nisei
looked to older Nisei for adaptational strategies used successfully during their
elderly years. Doi suggested that this rite of passage for Japanese American elders

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Cultural transmissions and maintenance of family bonds can be seen in Hmong
American New Year rituals. Lynch, Detzner, and Eicher (1995) found that older
Hmongs living in the United States use clothing attire during New Year rituals
as a medium in which to express their vision of the Hmong culture as expressed
in the past and its relevance for American culture. While engaging in the rituals,
formalized linkages between family elders occur as they teach younger generations
Hmong traditions. This formalized role has reinforced and raised the status
of Hmong elders as cultural historians in contrast to the American context in
which younger, highly educated members are esteemed and rewarded.


<i><b>Caring for Elders</b></i>


A major challenge faced by families is caring for elderly, frail, and chronically
ill relatives. The cultural values regarding social relationships within the API family
show evidence of strong cultural clashes in the area of caregiving and end of
life decisions for frail family members. There have been few studies on caregiving
for frail family members among API communities. Role modeling of the traditional
caregiving roles might not be direct observations. First, many API middle-aged
individuals have not directly observed their parents caring for frail grandparents
because these grandparents might never have lived to a very old age in the home
country or because these caregiving responsibilities were left to siblings caring
for these elderly relatives back in the homeland. Learning about filial piety from
a distance, through stories, or in the abstract produces greater diversity in expressions
of filial beliefs and behaviors than if these API individuals directly observed
their parents taking care of their elderly grandparents. The resulting filial
piety beliefs and behaviors may be romanticized and take idealized forms in practice,
show differences between values and behaviors, or show variance from behaviors
actually exhibited by an earlier cohort.


Because only a handful of empirical studies have examined caregiving for
API elders, living arrangement patterns, such as three-generational families, may
reveal whether relatives might be available to help during a health crisis. The
1980 census revealed that situational or contextual variables such as SES or availability
of adult children, as well as cultural values of filial piety or the practice
of primogeniture (i.e., agricultural practice of oldest son living with parents after
he gets married and identified as the unquestionable heir), contributed to the
pattern of living arrangements found among Asian elderly. Burr and Mutchler
(1993) found that single women (i.e., widowed, never married, divorced) who
were age 55 years or older and of Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, or Korean descent
varied in their living arrangements. These authors found that older, single Chinese
and Filipino women who were less acculturated were more likely to live with

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A different living arrangement pattern emerges for Asian Indian elderly women.
Burr (1992) examined the 1980 census and found that unmarried elderly Asian
Indian women were much more likely to live alone than were other Asian elderly
groups and lived alone at higher rates than did their Caucasian counterparts.
Higher income levels were associated with greater independent living among
Asian Indian unmarried elderly women. Lower income levels and difficulty with
using public transportation were associated with living in complex households
(i.e., with relatives or nonrelatives). What could not be answered from this study
of census data is whether this independent living is preferred by the Asian Indian
elderly women themselves or desired by their relatives. Availability of children
and other Asian Indians in close proximity reduces the odds of unmarried Asian
Indian living alone. This suggested that perhaps multiple factors (e.g., higher
income levels, unavailability of Asian Indian relatives and friends) contributed
to a higher proportion of Asian Indian elderly women living alone.


Kamo and Zhou (1994) suggested that once key predictor variables (e.g.,
marital status, state of residence, gender) are controlled, the probability of elderly
coresiding in extended family households is very similar for Japanese and Chinese
elderly, as reflected in the 1980 census. Living in extended family settings is adaptive
for API elderly. The impact of cultural values and filial piety can be maintained
across as many as four API generations. Other variables may work to increase or
decrease the impact of culture but may do so in a nonlinear fashion. This study
suggested that the multivariate impact of key predictors is no simple matter. Coresidence
makes caregiving more convenient but does not ensure it. What we now
need to know is how API families make decisions about living arrangements,
what contextual factors influence these decisional processes, and how caregiving
is provided to vulnerable elderly relatives in API families.


Changes in caregiving expectations and the practice of filial piety among
Asians can be seen cross-culturally and within Asian Americans living in Western
countries. For example, Ikels (1983) did an extensive ethnographic study examining
adaptation and aging among Chinese in Hong Kong and Boston. What she

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ikels (1983) found that most older people made major contributions to running
the household so that other household members were free to engage in
money-making activities. Problems arose most acutely during times of incapacitating
illnesses. Ikels suggested that the major difference between Hong Kong
and Boston was the degree to which an older person could function independently
and the level of sociocultural supports for elders in the immediate environment
in which the elderly person lived. Hong Kong elders appeared to manage most
activities without assistance. Hong Kong elders had ready access to shopping and
medical treatment of choice and were surrounded by people who shared the same
language. Yet, Hong Kong Chinese elders' independence was limited by financial
constraints and availability of alternatives that created higher coresidence. By
contrast, Chinese elders living in Boston acknowledged the notion that coresidence
was less culturally accepted, but when the elderly became frail, coresidence
was an acceptable alternative to institutionalization. The majority of middle-aged
residents in Boston recognized that their parents could enjoy life to a greater
extent in Hong Kong or Taiwan rather than in the United States. Elders who
were becoming frail and could not manage on their own then moved permanently
to the United States to be with or near their children.


Yu, Kim, Liu, and Wong (1993) found an inverse relationship between health
status of Chinese elders and the likelihood of recommending a nursing home as
the best living arrangement. Nearly 90% of healthy Chinese elders selected the
nursing home; 84% of chronically ill elders, 76% of disabled elders, and 60%
of incontinent elders felt this same way. Living in the home of one's children or
having other living arrangements increased as the health condition of the Chinese
elder declined. By contrast, only 6% of Korean elders recommended a nursing
home for elders who had children living in the same city. Korean elders strongly
desired living independently if healthy, but with chronic illness, the desire to turn
to a nursing home increased to 31%. In addition, 60% of Chinese elders in this
sample thought that children should support their parents, even when the parents
were financially self-supportive. By contrast, only 46% of Korean elders felt that
children should support their parents. According to Yu et al. (1993), Chinese
dependence on children went beyond mere economics. The large majorities of Chinese
(76%) and Korean (81%) elders felt that if they could not care for themselves,
then their children would take care of them in the short and long term.


The scant caregiving literature suggests that multiple patterns of caregiving
exist among API families today. Yu (1983) surveyed four age cohorts (18-25 years,
26-35 years, 36-55 years, and 56 years or older) totaling 510 Chinese residents
in a midwestern university town concerning how filial obligations are met. She
did not find a positive correlation between filial beliefs and age cohorts. The 26-
to 35-year age cohort held the highest filial beliefs; however, these beliefs had
no correspondence to their filial behaviors such as contributing money and meeting
housing needs of their parents. It appears that acculturation interacts with
proximity when expected filial behaviors might actually be solicited.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yu and Wu (1985) examined the impact of length of residency on filial beliefs
and behaviors. The sample was divided into newcomers (1-5 years in the United
States), new-old residents (6-15 years), old-old residents (longer than 16 years),
and American-born Chinese. They found that longer residency in the United
States resulted in less distress felt when giving financial support to parents. The
newcomers were very distressed at giving financial support to parents. This might
be due to multiple acculturation stressors and strains experienced by new Chinese
immigrants in the United States. U.S.-born Chinese females were distressed in
meeting financial needs of parents-in-law. Old residents and females experienced
significantly higher distress levels than did males in meeting housing needs of
parents-in-law. Old residents and U.S.-born respondents felt more comfortable
in meeting filial responsibilities.


In an unpublished study of 4,029 Hawaii government employees, Takamura,
Nitz, and Haruki (1991) found that 20% were assisting older adults with one
or more of the activities of daily living or providing direct financial help to
persons age 60 years or over. Fully 68% of caregivers were women, with an
average age of 44 years. In addition, 70% of care recipients in Hawaii were
female, with an average age of 76 years and with 58% of the sample suffering
from health-related problems. Asian Americans (i.e., Japanese, Chinese, Filipino,
and Korean Americans) were overrepresented in the caregiver group relative to
their proportions in the sample as compared to Caucasians in the sample. Cultural
values, longevity, and low family mobility led to the presence of API elders living
in close proximity and contributed to higher Asian American caregivers in this
Hawaiian sample.


Takamura et al. (1991) also found ethnic group differences in the use of
caregiver services and materials. Caucasian caregivers used written materials, caregiver
workshops, and counseling to a higher degree than did API caregivers in
this sample. They proposed that this low level of caregiver service use might
relate to language difficulties, feelings of alienation, distrust of health professions,
limited financial resources, and the desire to provide caregiving within the family.
They also found differences in the effects of caregiving responsibilities. API caregivers
mentioned being overwhelmed, feeling confined, and paying back family
obligations more frequently than did Caucasian caregivers. This stressful life experience
was balanced by the opportunity to fulfill family obligations and demonstrate
filial piety among API caregivers.


Interviews with an immigrant Chinese wife, immigrant Chinese daughter,
and Japanese American daughter-in-law revealed that providing care was considered
a required and necessary family function (Goodman, 1990). English-only
services were not a viable option for a demented relative who either never had
or lost his or her English skills due to dementia. Osako and Liu (1986) found
that among Nisei and Sansei (second- and third-generation Japanese Americans,
respectively), only 12.6% of parents and 7.6% of daughters felt that they should
share a household, although almost 50% of the elderly lived with one of their
children. This implied that although independent living was the goal, when the
elderly parents needed assistance, Japanese American children moved them into

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The caregiving literature suggests that women bear a disproportionate
amount of the burden in caregiving for both children and elderly relatives in
their families (Chiriboga, Yee, &amp; Weiler, 1992). The job of caregiver for elderly
relatives usually is based on ritualized patterns of inheritance, proximity, emotional
closeness, and gender roles (Caffrey, 1992). Caregiving for elderly relatives
facilitated their kin-keeping role by maintaining the emotional interdependence
of families and ensured that obligations to elders, who were soon to be ancestors,
had been met. Although Asian American families in general have become more
accepting of institutionalization of their elderly relatives, they still are more reluctant
than the general population to do so. This reluctance is broken by behaviors
such as wandering, incontinence, or secondary illnesses that overwhelm
families' ability to manage everyday functions (Goodman, 1990; Morton, Stanford,
Happersett, &amp; Molgaard, 1992).


Our current notions about caregiving in a handful of studies on Chinese and
Japanese American families might not be found in other API ethnic groups; generalizations
might be limited by the cohort, generational, social class, and acculturative
characteristics of API families such as those found among recent
immigrant segments of these populations or refugee families. Critical issues expressed
by a focus group of Asian Indian elderly women (National Asian Women's
Health Organization, 1996) were financial and physical dependence. After years
of caring for their grandchildren, these elderly women found it difficult to ask
for care and help in dealing with chronic illness or disability. These sentiments
were expressed as fears by these Asian Indian elderly women, who experienced
loneliness because they lacked mobility and could not speak English. The high
incidence of independent living among this group suggests that appropriate aging
services must be accessed because, at least for this Asian elderly group, families
might not be willing or able to provide these services. As API families care for
elderly relatives in frail physical or mental health, the likelihood of elder abuse
can increase. API traditional beliefs about caring for elderly relatives as the family's
sole responsibility make these API families less likely to seek outside caregiver
respite and support services.


<b><i>Elder Abuse</i></b>


Elder abuse can occur when the family's resources, in the context of acculturative
stressors by new immigrants, are stretched beyond the family's capacity
to care for frail and vulnerable family elders. In a rare study of elder abuse, Moon
and Williams (1993) found that Korean American elders perceived less abuse and
defined it more narrowly than did either African or Caucasian American samples.
The Korean American elders were the least educated, had the lowest income,
were more likely to live alone, and had the least number of children living in the
same state as compared to African and Caucasian American elders in the sample.
These elderly were presented with 13 hypothetical scenarios, and the authors

API elders see the enormous stress and burden that their caregiver must shoulder
and might seek to lessen their burden by not asking for help when needed
or by committing suicide to get rid of the family burden. Investigators (Liu &amp;
Yu, 1985; Mcintosh &amp; Santos, 1981; Yu,1991) have noted higher rates of suicide
among elderly Asian women and in particular among Chinese elderly women.
Contextual precursors for high rates of suicide among elderly Asian women must
be examined more closely.


<b><i>Death and Dying</i></b>


Another stressful challenge for API families is the family processes in dealing
with a dying family member, grieving, and death. Issues that revolve around death
and dying are not so complex in developing countries. However, in our technologically
advanced and litigious society, these issues are brought to our attention
every day. There is a dramatic effect of culture on advanced directives and life-
support ~decisions in America. Withdrawing life support always is a difficult decision
for families, and the idea of terminating life support can be offensive,
wrong, and not consistent with their worldview.


Klessig (1992) examined life-support decisions for terminal situations among
African American, Chinese, Jewish, Iranian, Filipino, Mexican American, and
Korean young or middle-aged patients. Caucasian Americans were less willing
to start life support and strongly agreed to stop life support. There were wide
variations among Asian patients; Chinese patients were equivocal about starting
life support and generally agreed to stop life support, Koreans wanted to start
life support and disagreed to stop, and Filipinos strongly agreed to start and
strongly disagreed to stop. This study suggested that life-support decisions can
be influenced by cultural and religious beliefs regarding active and human interventions
to prolonging or ending life. The cultural barriers lay in different acculturation
levels within the family, which gets translated into different beliefs
about the use of extraordinary means (e.g., high-technology medicine that keeps
organs alive although the brain is dead) to keep dying patients alive. There might
be differences between the generations regarding the older or dying patient's
wishes to turn off artificial means of living versus the family wanting to keep the
patient alive as long as possible to fulfill its filial responsibility.


Cultural values concerning disclosure of health diagnosis and prognosis, the
role of the family in making medical decisions, and the withholding or withdrawing
of treatment for terminally ill patients are complicated by linguistic and communication
difficulties that can have significant impacts on the interactions between

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recent literature suggests a more complex picture expressed in the notion
that traditional APIs cannot be told about fatal illnesses. Der-McLeod (1995) at
On Lok, a community-based agency serving mostly Chinese frail elderly in Northern
California, found under culturally competent conditions that Chinese elderly
would discuss and make decisions concerning end of life interventions such as

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Procedures for cardiac pulmonary resuscitation or nasogastric tube feeding
were described in detail. The majority of Chinese frail elderly did not want someone
pounding on their chest to resuscitate them or putting a respirator tube down
their throat to help them breathe. Most said that they wanted to go peacefully
because they lived a long time and had outlived family and friends. A smaller
group would not answer or did not want to discuss the question. In response to
a second advance directive, use of a nasogastric tube to maintain nutritional status,
the majority of Chinese elders preferred to make this decision when the situation
was more imminent. After determination of the Chinese elder's health wishes, a
social worker followed up with family members and presented these health
wishes. Der-McLeod (1995) found that family members often were relieved that
their elderly relative had made the decision so that they no longer had that responsibility.
On Lok encouraged family members to discuss this issue with their
elderly relative. Der-McLeod contended that carrying out contracts and obligations
is based on building correct relationships (i.e., family, friendships, professional
relationships) and not based on law. Decisions are not based on what an
individual decides; rather, they are based on what is best for the common good.
It appears that if an appropriate cultural context is provided, then end of life
decisions and advanced directives can be discussed with the majority of Asian
patients and their families.


Death rituals and the expression of grief vary by culture, acculturation, and
API ethnicities. The API family must cope with feelings of grief and deal with
the aftermath of these events (Kagawa-Singer, 1994). Death and dying is a universal
human experience, but culture provides practices to enable the grieving
family to better cope with the loss of a loved one and provides ritual proscriptions
for supportive activities during a stressful and often confusing time (Janes, 1990).


The Cult of the Ancestors is maintained for Asians who are Buddhists; they
believe that ancestors who are not properly respected and prayed to after death
will come back to haunt the family. Family shrines and proper rituals on death
anniversaries still are maintained today. According to Buddhist beliefs, the state
of mind of the dying person at the moment of death is thought to influence the
rebirth process. Being calm and having a positive state of mind improves the
chances of a favorable rebirth (Truitner &amp; Truitner, 1993). According to Bliatout
(1993), the Hmong believe that proper burial and ancestor worship directly influence
the health, safety, and prosperity of the family. As the time of death grows
nearer, family members gather around the sickbed of the dying elder and talk
about family history. Funeral rituals and exchange of labor during this grieving
process provide needed social support that strengthen Hmong communities.
Proper displays of grief by the surviving spouse and children demonstrate family
loyalty. Kind thoughts and expressions about the deceased relative are proper protocol.
Family members reciprocate by describing how calm and good-humored

<b>ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER FAMILY
RESEARCH GAPS AND CHALLENGES</b>


The empirical work on API families has just begun and is a relatively unexplored
area of psychology. Conducting research on API families offers many challenges
to psychology. The first research challenge is to highlight typical life-span developmental
hurdles and life crises that expend resources of even the most resilient
API families. We need to better understand how acculturation to the American
cultural context, through socialization and enculturation processes, produces
adaptive strategies that enable API individuals to traverse life-span developmental
dilemmas for immigrant API families as well as examine how these same processes
operate across second, third, and fourth generations of API families. Development
of resiliencies and family difficulties relates to how acculturative and socialization
processes blend and shape API families to produce a wider variety of adaptive
strategies to deal with a multicultural world. The resiliency model reinforces the
notion that a sole focus on the negative repercussions of trauma loses sight of
the tremendous resilience demonstrated by some humans under the most deplorable
of conditions. Adversity can be an insurmountable barrier or a worthy challenge
to spite the odds. Many API families take this challenge to heart, yet
psychologists must not lose sight of those API families who might need a little
support to deal most effectively with these critical life events. Rutter (1994) suggested
that we must differentiate between risk indicators and those mechanisms
that put individuals at risk. For instance, poverty makes good family functioning
more difficult, but poverty alone is not a sufficient precursor of conduct disorder
(Shawtaylor &amp; Benokratis, 1995). A consideration of risk mechanisms for family
discord, such as witnessing strong negative interactions between parents or between
parents and children, and poor parental modeling or maladaptive parenting
practices can lead to failure to learn effective coping or social problem-solving
skills during key developmental periods and can lead to lifelong chaining of deviance
or psychopathology from childhood into adulthood. We know little about
the risk mechanisms for API families because culture and minority experiences
complicate our study of these issues. A closer examination of acculturation mechanisms
to determine what aspects of traditional cultures are maintained and what
aspects of the new culture are adopted should be explored.


Although there has been a steady increase of API family research initiatives,
better conceptual models are needed to explain the impact of family and its socialization
practices on the development of API children. These conceptual models
should take into account the cultural context of API children and heterogeneity
of these API populations rather than being devoid of many cultural underpinnings

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

API research initiatives in adolescence and young adulthood should explore
questions such as the following. How do families encourage development of positive
ethnic identities and adaptive life skills in the context of American culture?
How do families influence occupational achievement and choices? How do occupational
stereotypes and societal barriers such as glass ceiling issues affect API
individuals and their families? How do families exert their influence over dating,
marital choices, and sexual behavior among API youths in the context of acculturation
factors?


Research initiatives on API families during the second half of life is only
beginning as an empirical science. There is much research to be done regarding
family relationships, family coping processes, and family decision making revolving
around issues of later life, disability, and caregiving in API communities. We
know almost nothing about API family decision-making processes in dealing with
the needs of older family members, critical predictors of caregiving, and institutionalization
among the variety of API communities across the United States. API
families are called on to advocate on behalf of their non-English-speaking and
frail elderly relatives to access services and effectively manage affairs during health
care crises.


An often overlooked and understudied function of the family (Yee, in press)
is the enculturation and socialization in the face of acculturative factors of certain
cultural and lifestyle habits that promote health such as nutritional patterns, physical
activities, use of medicinal and other substances, coping strategies (Marsella
&amp; Dash-Scheuer, 1988), stress reduction, adaptive strategies such as use of confession
as symbolic healing (Georges, 1995; Wellenkamp, 1995), andother worldviews
that can affect physical and mental health. Socialization of traditional
lifestyle habits may or may not promote health under significantly different environmental
conditions from which these lifestyle habits evolved or at different
developmental stages.


Many questions need to be answered, such as the following. How does acculturation
of younger family members affect middle age and elderly life-span
transitions of older family members? How does this vary by gender and API ethnic
group? How does acculturation interact with socialization in the process of child
care by family elders who hold more traditional cultural beliefs? What is the
impact of acculturative and enculturative processes on identity, social roles, and
life skills among middle-aged and elderly API family members in later life? What
is the nature of supportive family relationships across generations such as grandparents,
parents, and children as well as within generations such as among
spouses, siblings, or cousins over the life span? How have family supportive relationships
been influenced by acculturation over the life span? How do API
families cope with the incomplete social support systems during times of crises?

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A second research challenge involves developing measurement, instrumentation,
and research methodologies for API families residing in the United States.
McCubbin, Thompson, and McCubbin (1996) summarized the literature on
families within a theoretical framework and presented some family assessment
instruments that should enhance the API family research efforts. What is clear
from this review is that there is very little research on API families. The majority
of psychological research on API families is descriptive, is of secondary or ancillary
nature, and often is derived from clinical observations or study of individual
family members rather than from examination of the family as the focal unit of
analysis (Jackson &amp; Hatchett, 1986; Kagitcibasi, 1989). The ways in which APIs
perceive family function, family roles, and social relationships might be significantly
different from how Caucasian Americans perceive them. What is lacking
is an examination of API family functioning and adaptation from different generational
perspectives within their particular social and cultural contexts and followed
longitudinally. Cross-sectional research designs allow a small glimpse of
family processes within a given historical moment and give us microscopic insight
into family adaptational processes over time. These are critical research gaps.
Standard methodological problems of reliability and validity must be addressed
with regard to specific age, gender, social class, and ethnicities that comprise the
diverse API community. Even definitions of what constitutes a "family" and how
families are counted must be considered in family methodology because they
vary across cultures and studies (Fitisemanu et al., 1994).


The development of psychosocial instruments and research methodologies
that are culturally valid to ensure reliability and validity with API populations
has just begun (Munet-Vilaro &amp; Egan, 1990; Zane, Park, &amp; Aoki, in press). Because
development of culturally appropriate API research methodologies and
instruments is in its infancy, the empirical literature on API families cannot move
forward until these crucial steps are taken (Yee, Mokuau, &amp; Kim, in press). Psychology
has made significant advancement in the measurement of acculturation
that has good psychometric properties for the API young adult population. However,
these are tested mostly on college student samples and some API ethnic
groups but are untested on other API ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, or a
broader age range than that of college samples. The basic instrumentation and
research methodologies in API family development have lagged far behind.


Key methdological strategies that may be considered "gold standards" in family
research are triangulation of standardized family instruments, physiological
measures such as heart rate and blood pressure, and observations of family
interaction (Gorall &amp; Olson, 1995). Culture has been shown to significantly influence
the validity and reliability of questionnaire instrumentation and observational
methodology (McCubbin et al., 1996). After this methodological
foundation is built, API families must be studied using family system methodologies
such as an examination of marital relationships from the perspective of both

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another research challenge is to solicit a greater number of longitudinal studies
of family processes in API communities. We discuss how socialization, enculturation,
and acculturation typically measured over an annual time frame affect
API family processes. Yet, we know very little about how these processes exert
their influence over decades of API generations living in the United States. The
problem is that much of our research on adaptation and family processes is examined
over microscopic time segments of behavior, as in cross-sectional designs
(e.g., 1-2 hours of behavioral samples), and might produce a vastly different empirical
picture to one generated by examining these processes over a longer period
of time (e.g., 1-10 years or longer) (Rosenbaum, 1990; Werner &amp; Smith, 1982).
This suggests that one must examine adaptational and family processes that occur
over a more lengthy but natural time frame in which they evolve, as in months,
years, or decades rather than in an hour or a week, as is typically measured.
Hypotheses could be generated and tested cross-sectionally but rigorously tested
longitudinally in the specific API population for which it will be generalized.


With more research methodologies that integrate heterogeneity of API families
into their conceptual frameworks, we might be able to ascertain key strengths
of resilient API families while addressing the needs of API families struggling to
cope with life in America. The key to the next century lies in what family psychology
can uncover about the dynamic and multidimensional interactions between
API family processes and the larger sociocultural environment. We have
only begun this journal of many thousand steps to understand API families
throughout the life course.
