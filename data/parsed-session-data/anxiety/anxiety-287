A month later, I was on a plane on my way to the most isolated capital
city in the world. My friends and family were excited on my behalf as
I'd made Perth sound like a fantastic place: relaxed, great beaches, cheap
real estate, bachelors galore. They didn't know the real reason I was leaving.
Only Emily was suspicious. ‘Are you sure about this?’ she'd said when
I'd told her the news. Of course, I'd said, sounding more confident that
I felt. I wasn't sure at all. I'd only ever been to Perth once before and
hardly knew anyone. It also felt like my last chance. I'd moved so often.


This just had to work.


‘Hello darling, how gorgeous to see you!’ It was my mother's cousin,
Annie, who I barely knew. She rushed out of the house as I pulled up in
the taxi and gave me a hug and a kiss. It wasn't what I'd expected, and,
while I was pleased, I was a little embarrassed. My side of the family
rationed affection, and I'd done nothing to deserve this.

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Annie went on to ask about the flight, my parents, my brothers, her
family, and then offered me dinner.


Her house, where I was going to stay until I found somewhere of
my own, was large and rambling, filled with a mixture of Persian
rugs, antiques and furniture rescued from junk shops. There were paintings
everywhere. Large doors opened from the kitchen and the sitting
room onto a back terrace and garden. It was already dark but the air
was still warm, and faintly perfumed.


Annie put a salad, some fresh bread, and some cold meat on a tray,
and her husband Charles poured us some wine. We ate outside. After
we'd eaten, Annie showed me my room.


‘We go swimming at around 6.30 am. If you want to join us we'd
love you to, otherwise, we'll see you for breakfast, and then Charles
will give you a lift into work.’


I lay in bed that night, tossing and turning. Part of it was jet
lag, part of it was excitement and part was fear. What if I couldn't
do the job? How would I meet people? What if I hated Perth? No,
I told myself, it would be fine. It was a chance to start again in a
small and friendly city. The job would be great and less stressful
than my last one. I'd have time to paint, to draw and to explore
Western Australia.


I fell asleep feeling confident that I'd made the right decision.


As the very pregnant outgoing manager walked me through the files
I began to feel anxious. This wasn't going to be straightforward. But
she was adamant. ‘If you have any questions don't hesitate to ring.’
She'd read my resumé, and had been on the selection panel at the video
interview. She knew that my sales and marketing experience was
limited: why should I be embarrassed to call her if I needed to?

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I arrived home at 6.30 pm, tired and conscious of what I'd taken
on. It was a small office, and though I now had an assistant, I was
going to be very busy.


On the upside, I now had a work car—with a V8 engine—and a very
cute new pink Macintosh computer.


‘You must be exhausted,’ was the first thing I heard when I walked
in. Annie then ordered me to lie down on the daybed in the corner of
the kitchen, and rest while Charles made us both gin and tonics.


This is great, I thought, as I sipped my drink. I could really get
used to this.


It took a month to find somewhere of my own to live, and during that
time I got to know my Perth cousins. Things were different on this side
of the Nullarbor. What really struck me was that they were all so friendly
and affectionate. And open.


‘That family secrecy,’ said Annie one day, as we were driving towards
a salvage yard to look for extra furniture. I'd moved into my own house
by then and didn't have quite enough. ‘I always hated it.’


Her own mother was infamous—and legendary—as she'd run away
to Sydney at eighteen to become a journalist. After getting a job she
had her hair bobbed and sent her mother her two long plaits in the
post. It was a gesture I'd always admired.


She'd come back the following year and married, but remained
outspoken and headstrong. Her daughters were the same.


Annie went on, ‘They don't tell me anything—I didn't know you'd
been sick for instance’.


Charles, a doctor, had noticed that I was on medication, and while
not asking what it was for, suggested that if it was something I was
taking regularly, then I should at least touch base with a local specialist.

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was fine now, I told them. And I was.


I'd been fine since leaving Sydney. The move appeared to have done
the trick.


‘It's not as though it's something to be ashamed about, of course,’
Annie had said. She wasn't at all like family.


The salvage yard was a treasure trove, and I found part of a kitchen
cupboard that I could use as a bedside table. Meanwhile, Annie had
found a piece of stainless steel to put on top of it. And I found a bookcase,
and a door that I could put over a table frame to make a desk.


At home that night, I rang my mother, excited, and told her about the
salvage yard and my finds.


‘It's not old junk I hope. I rather hoped you'd got beyond that.’
I gritted my teeth. She just couldn't move on, could she? She just
couldn't get over the fact that I'd once lived in a warehouse and had
worn damaged, second-hand clothes. After I'd left Melbourne, she
remained on edge, seeing me as unpredictable, someone who was, at
any moment, about to do something embarrassing. It meant that every
conversation was fraught.


How long would it take to be forgiven?


I wished she were more like Annie. And then felt disloyal. She was
my mother after all, and she didn't mean things to be this way. Still, it
was nice to be on the other side of the country and have a desert
between us.

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For less than the price of a small one-bedroom flat in inner city Sydney,
I was able to rent a whole house in inner city Perth. Built in the 1940s,
it had two bedrooms, one that I could use as a study. In the sitting room
there was a large window overlooking a park. The park came with a
lake and swans. Black swans. There was a small garden in the front,
and, at the back, an ivy-covered garden shed.


A week after putting down a rental deposit, my furniture had been
delivered. My bed, an antique I'd bought in a junk shop in Melbourne
years ago, had a homemade base. I'd sticky-taped pine slats to the side
rails. It was always meant to be a temporary measure, but somehow,
I'd never got around to fixing it properly. Now seemed the right time.
I looked at the base again and realised that if I anchored two boards
on the rails, I could then secure the slats to them. I borrowed an electric
drill and completed the job.


Fixing my bed had been simple—everything that seemed to be
difficult elsewhere was easy in Perth. Work was only five minutes
away by car and the closest shopping centre, Subiaco, had cafés, a
supermarket and a cinema. My cousins were only ten minutes down
the road.


I began going to gallery exhibitions, found clothes shops I liked, and
generally enjoyed exploring the place.


I tried not to think about the fact that I still didn't really know anyone
who wasn't related to me.


I didn't want to impose on the cousins of my own age, who, despite
being friendly, were busy. Similarly, my work mates, while pleasant,
didn't show any interest in doing anything outside work hours. They
had their own lives. I could have asked them to introduce me to people
when I first arrived, could have explained that I knew no-one. But
I didn't want them to think that I wasn't settling in, or that I wasn't
able to meet people by myself.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As far as everyone was concerned then, I was happy. I liked my own
company and was getting along well. I wasn't lonely, I told myself. Only
old ladies got lonely. In fact, things were going well. I had a real house,
a real car and a real job. I had all the things an adult should have. It
occurred to me that I actually was an adult: it was a frightening thought.
I wasn't ready yet. I hadn't worked things out. I wasn't poised, elegant,
assured. I still felt like an awkward seventeen-year-old in many ways,
and was in fact often still mistaken for a student. But I wasn't and hadn't
been for years. I was now over 30. Many of my friends were married,
and had businesses, or serious jobs. Many of them were happy.


Every time I spoke to Emily, or my old university friend Dee, I put
the phone down feeling slightly depressed. They, to me, seemed to be
living. Emily was now in Tokyo, going to nightclubs until 5 am, flying
over to Hong Kong for weekends. Dee was an architect living with
the man she loved in Bondi. Even Catherine, who I still remembered
as a child with mulberry stains through her hair, was an economist,
now married and living in London. Peter was a corporate solicitor.


Everyone, it seemed, was thriving. I felt a sense of frustration.
Why couldn't I thrive? What kept me from engaging with life? Even
when I was content, I often felt removed, as though I were watching
everyone else through a sheet of glass.


I was determined to make things work. I joined a gym and started
attending life drawing classes. The key, I decided, was to do things
that I enjoyed. A character in <i>Good Morning Midnight</i>, a Jean Rhys novel
used the phrase ‘my little life’. It seemed to be an apt one. Perhaps
that's all it was. Perhaps I was wrong to want something more; perhaps
there wasn't anything more. Maybe this was how it was for everyone,
and I was simply being unreasonable. The thing was, I'd tried everything:
drugs, moving, changing jobs, changing clothes, losing weight —
but I always ended up in the same place.

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whenever anyone asked me, I told them I was doing well.
Increasingly, I made phone calls to my friends in the east, and even to
my parents. I tried to avoid the enveloping sense of isolation.


There was another reason for not feeling as happy as I might. The
job, which had started off difficult, was becoming more so by the day.
I didn't want to bother my predecessor, who'd by now had her baby, so
I tried to muddle through. The one person who could have helped didn't.
He worked for me, but was too busy white-anting, and being bitter, to
offer useful advice. He resented my age, sex and most of all my obvious
inexperience, and made no secret of it. If he found a typo somewhere,
say in a flyer, he'd fax it to me, and often to my boss as well. It reached
the point where every time I did something, I was nervous. Even the
things I knew I could do with my eyes closed, such as organising launches
or publicity, became stressful and difficult. I began to actively hate going
into the office. It seemed that everyone except my assistant and my boss
wanted me to resign, but I couldn't do it.


I knew I'd made the wrong decision in accepting the job in the first
place but I was determined to stick it out. I'd made a commitment and
I couldn't bear the thought of admitting that I'd made yet another mistake.
You can move only so many times before people start to notice and ask
questions and I couldn't afford for anyone to start asking questions.


My solution was to get fit.


Going to the gym gave me something to look forward to after work,
and somewhere to go. It was either that, or go home and drink. I
thought the gym would be less dangerous—I was wrong.


One morning, I woke up, as usual, and tried to sit up. As I did so,
I became aware of the most excruciating pain in my neck. I lay down
again and moved my toes, my legs, my arms. They were all fine. It was

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Deciding there couldn't be anything really wrong with me, I made
another attempt to get up, thinking that if I did it quickly, it might
hurt less. It didn't, but the pain didn't last as long. I walked slowly
towards the bathroom. Perhaps a shower would help. It didn't, but by
moving very carefully, I was able to work out which positions hurt
and which were manageable. If I stayed perfectly still, for example,
I could avoid the pain. Somehow, by making careful use of the car's
mirrors, I managed to drive myself to work.


It didn't occur to me to stay home.


As I tried to He down that night, I realised that it wasn't going to happen.
I was better off sleeping upright on the couch. So, after finding a quilt
and another pillow, I settled down for the evening. It was a very long
night, as every time I moved in my sleep, I was woken up with a blast
of pain.


It was no better by the next day—worse if anything—so I rang
Annie to find out if she could recommend a doctor. (Charles was
a research scientist, and hadn't actually treated anyone for years.)


I had seen a GP when I'd first arrived and needed a new prescription
for Tegretol. He'd asked a few questions, and then said, ‘So why
do you think you want to hurt yourself?’


I sat there, thinking it was a rhetorical question, and waiting for him
to tell me. There was a few minutes' silence, and then it dawned on me
that he was actually waiting for me to answer. ‘I don't know.’ Stress
exacerbated the urge, but I didn't know why I wanted to do it in the
first place.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He then asked if I was religious.


It was an odd question. I told him that I'd been brought up as an
Anglican, but that it wasn't something I thought about.


He had a theory about the link between self-harm and religion,
but said it was just a theory. Hardly even that. Just that there might be
a link.


Historically, yes, there was, of course. I thought of hairshirts and
self-flagellation. But I thought he was missing the point. I didn't tell
him, but I thought that if there was a link, it wasn't to do with belief,
but guilt.


He wrote out the prescription and I decided not to see him again.


The doctor Annie recommended practised a mixture of traditional and
alternative medicine. He felt around my neck and said that he didn't
think it warranted an X-ray. Not yet. Anti-inflammatories and rest
should do it.


‘Aside from the neck, how are you feeling?’ he asked. While I'd
waited in the reception area, I'd filled in the required form, giving a
few details of my medical history. He now had this in front of him. ‘It
must be tough coming over here by yourself from the east. How are
you settling in? Have you met many people?’


‘Not really.’ It was embarrassing but true.


‘You've obviously got a history of depression. You don't have any
concerns about that at the moment, do you? Moving is a big thing.’


I took a deep breath. ‘I'm fine. I want to drive my car into a brick
wall, but otherwise I'm fine.’ Until I uttered those words, I hadn't
realised that was how I felt. I was shocked.


The doctor was calm. ‘Okay. Are you thinking about doing that
any time soon?’

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘I can't drive well enough at the moment.’ I smiled.


‘Actually, you shouldn't be driving at all.’ He paused. ‘Have you felt
like doing something like this before?’


I wasn't sure. I'd felt miserable, depressed, melancholy, destructive
and angry but had I ever coldly, seriously contemplated giving up
entirely? I'd taken too many pills, but that was because I needed a rest
from myself. And I had driven into another car—but no, despite it
all, I hadn't.


This was a new development.


The truth was I felt possessed. I could cope with depression —
I didn't like it, but could deal with it. What I couldn't deal with was
not having control of my mind. And that's what had happened.


I admitted, finally, and with huge relief, that I felt like cutting
myself constantly: at work, when I woke up, when I was watching
television, when I was driving, eating, showering. All the time. Visions
of blood dripping down my forearms, of smeared knives, of used
razors, of jagged wounds all collided with each other. The more I tried
to put them out of my head, the more insistent they became. They
were vivid and vicious.


They had also reached a new level of intensity and I was distraught.
After all, they were what I had been running from for so many
years now. They were why I left so many houses, so many cities. It
was as though they had always been waiting for me here in Perth,
and it was only a matter of time before I arrived and they found me
alone, defenceless.


Part of me—and it was getting stronger daily—was convinced that
the only way to stop them was to give in. To get a knife and get it over
with. I knew the reason the thoughts were so persistent was because
I wasn't giving in.


All I needed to do was let go.

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But if I started again, I wouldn't be able to stop. I'd held off now
for five years but just didn't know what to do. I didn't want to live
this way anymore. I couldn't. I just wanted them to stop and, apparently,
was prepared to do whatever was necessary to make that happen.


‘I think we need to get you in to see a psychiatrist asap,’ said the
doctor. While he was looking in his address book, he asked what kind
of treatment I'd had in the past.


‘Not a lot, not really. Drugs.’ I listed them. ‘A bit of group therapy
while I've been in hospital from time to time but nothing else.’


‘Have you ever had any cognitive behavioural therapy?’


I didn't even know what it was.


‘I think you'd really respond to it,’ he said.


Then he made an appointment for the following week for me with
a psychiatrist who had a practice around the corner. I was to go back
and see him in two days' time. ‘If you need to come in before then, just
let me know. Here's my card,’ and he wrote another number on the
back. ‘That's my mobile. Call any time.’


As I left, he called out behind me, ‘Do send my best to Annie and
Charles when you next see them’. Annie later told me he'd been to uni
with one of her sons.


By the time I got home, I was exhausted. Admitting that I felt like
I did meant that I also would have to confront the question of why.
Now 31, I realised that if I didn't work it out soon, my life wasn't
ever going to get better. I would never be happy if I didn't confront
it. Whatever ‘it’ was.


And what kind of therapy was he talking about anyway? Surely if it
was something that was going to work, someone would have suggested
it before?

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While the stiffness and the acute pain that shot from my neck whenever
I moved were disabling, they also brought intense relief. For a few
precious days I was spared my mental torment and I had a chance to
think about what I wanted, rather than just coping, from hour to hour.


I knew that I didn't have long and that this was just a window of
respite. It was like the intermission in a film. The images would be back,
probably worse, once my body began to mend.
