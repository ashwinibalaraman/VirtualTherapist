<b>THE BABY IS NOW THE TODDLER.</b> It really is getting easier.


Everyone said it would. <i>This too shall pass</i>, they said. <i>The way
out is through</i>, they said. Kindly platitudes to mollify me, but they
were true. Now I believe mothers when they say the things that
mothers say.


I still have days when anxiety sickens me, when I want to punch
people out. And when I say "I want to punch people out," I am to
be believed. This is not an idle, hypothetical threat; this is an actual
clenched fist, holding in my anger. Their stupid remarks reverberate
when I am falling asleep at night, and I inevitably ask myself
what I haven't done, what I haven't tried to be a better mother, to
be a better person.


A trip to the farmers market leads to a conversation with a
homeschooling mother of seven, a flower-grower whose offspring
are assembling bunches of blossoms and greenery for Clarksville
yuppies. One of her children attended Jim's class after he was main-streamed
into the public school system, and the two of them are
catching up next to a bucket of sunflowers. Which leaves me to chat
up the mother—about her flowers, about her kid, about my kid.


"Are you still at home with him?" she asks.


"Yes," I say, "and I'm finishing my first book."

"Isn't it great? I just love being at home with mine."


I could point out that neither she nor her family is actually at
home, but downtown in the midst of activity. Instead I just smile
and nod.


"Really, I hear women complain about being home with their
kids, and I just want to slap them! We had so much fun, didn't we,
sweetie?" Jim's former student, who's just been on his first trip to
Europe and is the valedictorian of his current school and is by all
accounts a perfect citizen, waves his agreement. "We had a loom,
and I'd weave, and we just all had a great time," she continues.


I'm still formulating answers to this. <i>It's not being home I complain
about. It's about being isolated and forgotten and left to handle all this by
myself about having doctors who push formula, steroids, nebulizers and
pat me on the head and send me home again. It's about insanity. It's about
me sticking your loom up your precious ass</i>.


But really I just want to hurt myself as quickly as I can, using
whatever's handy—a wall to hit, teeth to bite, fingernails to dig. I
have no words for my anger. I only know how to turn it into pain.


Apparently, the same is true for toddlers.


I had a setback when Baldo threw his first bona fide shitfit. I
denied him something inconsequential; I can't even remember what
it was—maybe I told him it was time to change his crapped-in diaper.
No crying, no yelling—he just smashed his forehead right into
the wall. Flopped down, beat himself against the floor. Reached out
and took my hand and bit it.


It's scary to watch a little kid rage. If you're trying to get over
hurting yourself, it's a bigger deal. All you can do is hold him still,

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All you can do is put faith in ratiocination. Hope that your kid
realizes that he can put a word to a feeling and scream it out loud.
An act of cognition is taking place. He'll recognize his anger, articulate
it, describe it, examine it, survive it. And so will you.


I infuriate my child. I take hazards out of his hands—a package
of batteries I hadn't realized was open, the Boudreaux's Butt
Paste he wants to squirt directly into his mouth. I close the refrigerator
door when he wants it open. He wants to scratch the dermatitis
on his feet, and I want to cram him into his cotton footies.
I sit him down to lotion him. I insist that we go back inside when
the mosquitoes are biting. I hear other mothers in my mind, better
mothers: <i>I created an environment in our home that says yes!</i> The
fuck you did. Your kid wants to run out into the street, just as
mine does.


It helps that I must categorically deny my child certain pleasures
in life. He'll never have those weird orange peanut-butter crackers
you get in truck-stop vending machines. He can't eat Halloween
candy or his friend Lily's sesame sticks. We can't follow the "natural
consequences" method. And here my background as a crazy person,
as an addict and a friend of addicts, comes in handy. Maybe it
doesn't help for me to hold him so tightly, to cry with him, to tell

As time went by, the universe threw me a bone. My child grew
into a deliciously verbal toddler. He talks as urgently as he used to
bash and bite. His feelings are extreme, like mine. He falls apart when
he's frightened—by big trucks, sharks, by scarecrows, by loud kids
on the playground. He catches an episode of <i>Teletubbies</i> at a friends
house and sobs hysterically when Noo-noo the vacuum cleans up
a splatter of Tubby custard, or whatever that shit is. "No TV!" he
screams. "We will not watch TV!" His two toddler friends look at
him blankly. For weeks afterward, he talks about the incident. I tell
naptime stories about it upon request. <i>And then Valerie turned off the
television and made the noisy machine go away</i>. He smiles.


We might as well go ahead and write him out a scrip for Paxil.


The world is not kind to my son. I fear he'll be small and sensitive
and an easy target for bashers. He's going to feel things deeply.
He'll probably wear black and discover The Smiths. (For about a
week, he asked to hear a song he called "This Way and That Way,"
which I could only assume was the morose ballad "Stretch Out and
Wait." He'd actually meant the kiddie classic "Have You Ever Seen
a Lassie?" which I guess he heard someplace happier.)


On one of my first evenings without the baby, I went to a friend's
house party. One of the other women was reading palms, a practice
I regard incredulously, skeptic that I am.


"You were tormented with thumbscrews in a previous lifetime
for being too educated," she concluded. "And look over here," she
added. "There's your son. You'll have one child. He chose you."

<i>He chose you</i>. Reverse causation was a ridiculous notion, even
when Schopenhauer advanced it. But it feels that way sometimes.
My baby made me his bitch. He stretched me to the limit of my
compassion. He broke my spirit and made me rebuild it so I would
be strong enough to love him.


With equal passion he extols what he loves—including me.


"Marrit," he says, for that's what he calls me.


"Yes?"


"I love ya."


He says it so quickly, so offhandedly. Yet we have this exchange
in the car, in the bathtub, at the dinner table, while we're playing
with stamps or markers or Play-Doh. And in these moments, I discover
that I am healed. We are healing ourselves together. We are
fierce and strong in love. Sometimes he is a little fart, but I know I
will never be closer to another person.
