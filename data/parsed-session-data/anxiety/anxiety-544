BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Um, your grandson better?
<b>PT:</b> He told us [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> I hate hearing that, that good, bad stuff [INAUDIBLE], that good, bad stuff, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Well, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No.  I mean, you know, he's just, uh, he's a smart kid.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he is.
<b>DR:</b> Imaginative and -
<b>PT:</b> I think what's happening is he always, one of the few advantages [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> That's right.  Are they okay, the kids that he's picking to hang out with?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah, um-hum, they seem to be.  Um, there were about 6 of them.  One was, one was black, black.  He told them he could not play with them anymore because they decided to play slave and they all wanted the black boy to be the slave -
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  Now whose idea was that?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Good grief!
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> That doesn't go over too well with the parents.
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what are you up to?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, [PHYSICIAN NAME].  If I could get my life under control, there are so many things that are a priority one.  One is that, one is all 3 of my grandsons, because I need to be a good grandmother -
<b>DR:</b> What makes you think you're not?
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well why do you think you're not?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  [INAUDIBLE], the divorce, going down every other week for 2 weeks at a time to take care of my mom with the Alzheimer's thing.  I just, everybody thinks, everybody thinks I'm being so strong, but I, I'm constantly teetering on the edge of it, and if I break, I can't break.  That's the problem.  I'm just tired of being tired.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, you, just like you, uh, suggested, you're going in a lot of different directions.  I hear about everybody else's problems, but I don't hear where you're attending to your own?
<b>PT:</b> I don't get that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, see, that's backwards, isn't it?
<b>PT:</b> I don't have time.
<b>DR:</b> You won't be -
<b>PT:</b> I try to stay busy so I don't think about [NAME OTHER], and then I have these evil thoughts, and I pray for God to forgive me, and turn right around and have same thoughts again.  Now [NAME OTHER]'s telling me, "You've got to forgive dad if you want forgiveness", and I've talked to my sister, and she said, "You might not ever forgive.  There's a difference in forgiveness and acceptance".
<b>DR:</b> Well, so what are you able to do, forgive or, or accept?
<b>PT:</b> Neither right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What is she suggesting to you, though?
<b>PT:</b> Give it time, and the divorce should've been filed.  [NAME OTHER] is in such a hurry for it to be filed.  We are finally reaching the final proposal.  [NAME OTHER], my attorney, was drafting it up today.  Here it is, it's stretched out almost a year because he didn't want to pay any alimony.  He told [NAME OTHER] he wasn't going to pay me money for the rest of my life.  He actually had the nerve, in his first affidavit, to say that he didn't need to worry about me financially because he knew my family would help me, and they have.
<b>DR:</b> And that's their responsibility as far as he's concerned, huh?  To be a burden for your children, right?
<b>PT:</b> Daddy always said, "If somebody helps you out with money, then they have the right to say it's nothing in your business", and I have had to ask my family for help, and it is very embarrassing.  It's humiliating, and that's one of the things, I, I hate to do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because it, nobody ever [INAUDIBLE] before, and now -
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> All the family.
<b>DR:</b> So is he agreeing with the alimony?
<b>PT:</b> Finally.
<b>DR:</b> Is he working?
<b>PT:</b> He said he's not.  He says not yet, but he, he's bought himself a new truck, yet the van that, that I was driving he was supposed to make payments on.  It's 2 payments, it is 2 payments behind, um, coming on third payment, and he, that, I'm getting rid of that.  I'm getting rid of the van [INAUDIBLE].  There's that and the fact that he withdrew in May his 401k money from [DEIDENTIFIED], and what [NAME OTHER] did to get him to agree to the alimony I wanted, she kind of blackmailed him into it.  In other words, if you do what [PATIENT NAME] wants, then we don't, uh, proceed with any action on him taking the 401k.
<b>DR:</b> Because he was prohibited -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> From doing so.
<b>PT:</b> He, [PHYSICIAN NAME] he honestly, he doesn't think he has to go by what the court says.  He just -
<b>DR:</b> I don't think -
<b>PT:</b> The last 2 times we went to court for, so he could have financial relief, he didn't even show up, and the judge was very, I mean, she said if he, if he needs financial relief, then he could at least have shown up, and she left it as it was.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think he thought you would fight him.
<b>PT:</b> That's one other thing I've got to say about my brother, that [INAUDIBLE] in [DEIDENTIFIED].  He's the one, I think he's more upset by my divorce than I am, but, what was I going to say?  He's the one that's been the most supportive, beside [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].  He gives me advice, which I don't always want, but he's been there for me.  Well, one of my sisters and, and my youngest brother.  My youngest brother knows I need a car.  He found one that he thought would be ideal, but it's a standard, and I can't drive it, but it needs [INAUDIBLE], and he told her, you know, he doesn't care how much she pays in a month as long as she pays him something, but if we move back to [DEIDENTIFIED], [NAME OTHER] was going to buy me a house, well, not buy it for me, but buy it, then I would pay him rent, but [NAME OTHER] also said, uh, told [NAME OTHER] that my mother ought to change her will, and he knows she, uh, not a sound mind because the Alzheimer's -
<b>DR:</b> What business does he have to say anything like that?  That's, uh -
<b>PT:</b> He kind of, he told me that my mother needs to change her will because I deserve the house more than my brother does.
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't, he doesn't care about you.
<b>PT:</b> No, he doesn't.
<b>DR:</b> He just doesn't want to pay you alimony.
<b>PT:</b> I just, that part I want over.  That'll be one thing over and done with.  My mother, I don't think she's going to be able to stay home much longer.  She's living in the past.  Yesterday, my sister was helping her decorate, and she took the tree skirt out of the box, put it around the tree, and she turned around and looked, and my mother was packing it up, and [NAME OTHER] said, "What, momma, what are you doing?"  And she said, "It's after Christmas.  It's time to pack everything up."  She took a nap after Thanksgiving lunch, woke up totally disoriented, but what's heartbreaking is my brother was having new countertops and vinyl flooring installed in the house, and he knew she'd be right in the middle of it, so I brought her home with me for 3 days.  Nobody but I saw her sitting and crying and say, "I just want to go home.  I just want to go home".
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, she won't do well out of her routine.  That's probably pretty confusing for her.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she gets terribly confused, terribly confused.  She, she's physically in good shape.  She'll be [AGE].  She goes out, and she'll cut kindling for her fireplace.  She'll rake her yard.  She does some housework, but she gets obsessive about it.  She, um, was obsessive about cleaning both bathtub, bathrooms, and then it's washing dishes.  It takes me a week, if we go every other week, it takes me a week to recover.  I'm tired of being -
<b>DR:</b> What about this idea of moving to [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> We're not moving to [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm not moving to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Once my mother's gone, there'll be nothing for me there.
<b>DR:</b> Well, there's your home.
<b>PT:</b> My home is here.  It's where -
<b>DR:</b> And somebody's offer -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Somebody offered you to buy you a house there.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], I don't mean to sound racist, but it's 68% black.  The school's are lousy.  You'd have to put [NAME OTHER] in private schools.  I could not, it will, my brothers and sisters would expect me to take care of my mother.  One of my brothers even suggested that I rent a 4 bedroom house and bring her to live with me.
<b>DR:</b> Here?
<b>PT:</b> I told him that would not be good.  Well, first thing I told him is that that wouldn't be fair to me -
<b>DR:</b> Good for you.
<b>PT:</b> And, and it wouldn't.  It would affect, it's like my sister told him, it wouldn't be fair to me or my family [INAUDIBLE].  It would be embarrassing to have [INAUDIBLE] great granddaughter wondering about.  I just, I can't get it all in line.
<b>DR:</b> Why?  Because you're not in control of it all either?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not in control of any part of it I feel.
<b>DR:</b> You.  You're in control of you, which is enough.  That's plenty to manage.
<b>PT:</b> I thought about going to the beach for a weekend.  There, there's something about the beach that rejuvenates my soul, but I can't do it because we went to [DEIDENTIFIED] in May, and my mother talks [INAUDIBLE] about she'd like to come back, back to [DEIDENTIFIED].  That water sounded so good.
<b>DR:</b> Why can't you go?
<b>PT:</b> Because my mom wants to go back, and I couldn't take her.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's your mom.  Why don't you go?  Aren't you entit -
<b>PT:</b> I can't.
<b>DR:</b> Aren't you entitled to, uh, some happiness?
<b>PT:</b> There'll be a day when I can do it.  There'll be a day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, [PATIENT NAME], if you don't take it, it won't happen.
<b>PT:</b> There'll be a day.  I'm just wasting time, wasting time.  I think [NAME OTHER]'s finally settling down, but we got drama last night, but I think he's settled down.
<b>DR:</b> Your medicine's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Is there anything you can give me to give me some energy?
<b>DR:</b> Besides Concerta?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Does that help?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well, before you take it, how are you?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I take it first thing in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> How long's it last?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think it's doing any good at all.
<b>DR:</b> You taking Xanax very often?
<b>PT:</b> No.  It makes me more tired.
<b>DR:</b> The Lamictal  still twice a day?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> And Depakote once a day?  And the Cymbalta's 90?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> And lithium.  You still on the Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] or Rozerem.  Maybe, uh, the answer might be more taking medicine away rather than adding to.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe, uh, the drug that's most sedating for you is going to be that Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I'm not going to fall apart?
<b>DR:</b> I don't think so because you're on the Lamictal now, and you're on the Neurontin still, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> I don't think you'll notice a difference other than being more alert.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That sounds good then.  I don't want to fall apart.
<b>DR:</b> You're on 10s, maybe cut you in half for a week or so, and if you don't notice a difference, then stop it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> What are you doing with yourself every day?
<b>PT:</b> If I'm home, do laundry, [INAUDIBLE] the house and clean.  When my mother, when I'm at my mother's, I just, she just wants to talk about the past, so I talk about the past with her.  I cook at my mother's.  I take things down to do.  It's hard, though, because she has, she's not slept in her, there's one bedroom.  That's where the beds are, and, uh, my sister takes a bedroom.  I don't.  I put my stuff in the bedroom and sleep in the same room with my mother so I can hear her when she gets up, but she'll rummage through my stuff.  She doesn't with my sister.  I need to put a lock and key on it I guess, but that's the one thing that tires me the most is being down there.
<b>DR:</b> I would think so.  It's kind of you to do though.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it started out with 4 of us taking a week at a time.
<b>DR:</b> You're down to 3, aren't you?
<b>PT:</b> Down to 2.
<b>DR:</b> Two?
<b>PT:</b> My brother works right here in [DEIDENTIFIED].  They allow him to work at home.  I don't know what he does, but now, all of the sudden, he can't work at home.  He's got to go in the office every day.  He tried to get it, because he feels he's the one that my dad told he would have to look out for my mom, and then I have [NAME OTHER], my sister.  I was telling people all, for years that she was an evil person and nobody would believe me, but she just, she had a, had to have colon surgery, and they made a tiny little incision [INAUDIBLE] to recuperate.  She came back for a week and then didn't come back no more.  So it's just [NAME OTHER] and me.
<b>DR:</b> But she's back now?
<b>PT:</b> Nope.  [NAME OTHER] and I have talked about it.  We're staying as long as we can, but I guess [INAUDIBLE] I remember my mother standing there crying saying, "I just want to go home".
<b>DR:</b> Your mother doesn't know what's best for her at this point.
<b>PT:</b> No, she doesn't.  We've checked into home care.  That's exorbitant.  [NAME OTHER] has checked into [DEIDENTIFIED], the nicest sounding one, um, nursing home, but I, I would just hate to, the thought of putting her in one of those places.
<b>DR:</b> But you don't want her to, you know, get hurt at the house either, and there are so many potential problems.
<b>PT:</b> The 2 things [NAME OTHER] and I have agree on is that she will definitely have to go in for is if she can't take care of her personal hygiene, and if she starts wondering, because you can't stay awake 24 hours a day.
<b>DR:</b> And she's not doing that now?
<b>PT:</b> No, she's not doing that.  She'll take out the trash or be raking or whatever, uh, you know, and I'll let her go and check on her about every 15 minutes.  She's still, she'll be out in the front yard picking up moss and picking up sticks, whatever's fallen down.  She just, she's got maybe 3 or 4 chores that she can [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Of the remote past?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> It's a sad thing when your brain dies before your body.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  She was always so alert.  She raised 7 kids, she had to be.
<b>DR:</b> That's impressive.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So we'll get this, uh, draft done and get it to your husband, and hopefully, uh, a court date soon?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if we're going to have to go to court for the final decree.  I hoped not.  I won't see him again.  He wanted to see the girls so, and the grandsons, so -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> He was on, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] had put him on, oh what's the name of it, a mood stabilizer.  Anyway, and evidently he's not as happy in his little world as we thought because he's gone back on it.  I can't remember what it is, but -
<b>DR:</b> Doesn't matter.  Did, did, uh, [NAME OTHER] go see him?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] came home in tears.  She said it was just like the day he left.  Then he came home.  He does what [NAME OTHER] usually, did what [NAME OTHER] usually does, which is try to act like it didn't bother her.  [NAME OTHER] told [NAME OTHER] that he loved him and missed him and didn't want him to leave.  I didn't think it was a good idea for [NAME OTHER] to see [NAME OTHER].  Maybe I was wrong.  I think the less [NAME OTHER] has to do with his grandfather, the better off he is.
<b>DR:</b> So where are you going today?  Getting, got lined up?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I'm going back home, cleaning my kitchen really well [INAUDIBLE] some other things for them to do so they can decorate.  We made a paper chain.  I've gone through my beautiful white and gold Christmas tree.  I don't know what it's going to look like this year, but Christmas is for kids.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, it's for all of us.  You can enjoy it too.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Those 3 are the only bright spot in my life right now.
<b>DR:</b> It's going to get better, right?
<b>PT:</b> It can't get any worse.
<b>DR:</b> Well, no.  Think it has been worse.  At least you've got some handle on your life and where you're living and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The Cymbalta tablets.  Do you cut those in half?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  It's the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Didn't think so, that's right.  I'm glad [NAME OTHER] is looking for work.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He didn't have a choice.
<b>DR:</b> I could -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Want to try the 5, 5 mg Zyprexa for 2 weeks and then stop it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If you don't notice any difference, that's fine, but if you do, then go back up with it.  Were you sick when she was sick?  Did you get it from her or -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Not yet, huh?  You won't.  I, I just rewrote all your medicines.  I wasn't quite sure where you were at, so you'll have them.  Just give it to the pharmacist if you need it.  I'm glad [NAME OTHER]'s better.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So when are you back down to [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Saturday.
<b>DR:</b> How's your health?  Your blood pressure, things like that?
<b>PT:</b> My blood pressure's been doing okay.  One night -
