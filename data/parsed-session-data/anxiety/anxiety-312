I HAVE written of bars and barricades, of hotel-keeping
and political candidatures, of two promising careers
that had the common feature of being nipped in
the bud through adverse circumstance. Careers whose
untimely end, however, gives them at least the
advantage of making a complete story for the autobiographer.


I have, in my previous chapter, made my bow as a
political candidate; in this one I must create the artistic
whole—and coincidentally relate the most unusual
experience of an unusual life—by telling of those final
days at "The Marlborough Arms" when, after an interval
of so many years, I stepped for a brief while into the
limelight as an active hotel-keeper.


My political candidatures ended in 1945. But, in my
association with hotel-keeping, the restless phase of my
life which is the subject of this book projected itself
forward into a more settled era, during which happiness
and domestic contentment had with passage of time
brought consolation for the disasters of which I have
written. That my <i>denouement</i> as a hotel-keeper lost
nothing in drama through this delayed culmination will
soon be sufficiently obvious.


Whereas I was removed from Chippenham by votes,
in the case of Woodstock I was taken for a ride.


But before I tell of this extraordinary ride of the
morning of Monday, October 16th, 1950, and the equally

[p. <i>253</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00257&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is some two or three chapters ago that I left myself,
during the winter of 1940-41, sitting in a manner not
unlike that of a displaced person, in the dining room of
"The Marlborough Arms." This was in the company of
Chris. However, when Chris had gone, my life continued
in the same pattern as before. "The Marlborough Arms"
continued to prosper; it was a repository for my belongings,
a home for my bereaved family; it was, after all,
somewhere to go. I continued throughout the War to
make my monthly pilgrimage, part sentimental, part
business, from Bristol back to the ancient borough. But
my active life was lived elsewhere and in other pursuits.
Increasingly I became a shadowy figure in the background
in the running of my own premises.


"The Marlborough Arms" to which I returned on my
demobilisation from the Army in the early autumn of
1945 was a different place to that which I had left some
years previously. The joys—and the pains—of amateurism
were over and these transformed premises now ran in
professional style under the aegis of my able, if sometimes
temperamental, manager, Mr. Max Ehrsam.


I have, I hope, made it abundantly clear that hotel-keeping
as an active pursuit had been thrust upon me.
The aims that Chris and I had set before us in the first
place had now been achieved. "The Marlborough Arms"
had been put under management. From its original
depths it had been translated to a high class hotel with a
high class custom. The charabancs no longer bothered us.
No embarassing visitors clustered around the upstairs
lavatories in the mornings. The locals were still welcomed
—provided that they paid the distinctly high price for
beer which ensured that they need only be welcomed in
small numbers. Meanwhile "the beautiful, the intelligent
and the well-bred" came in and out of our decorative

[p. <i>254</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00258&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This piece of highly-tuned machinery was "running
itself" as far as I was concerned. I could betake myself
and my interests elsewhere, and accordingly I betook
myself to London where my interests became devoted
to my publishing firm. Following some months' stay
at Woodstock in the autumn and winter of 1945-46,
I was once again living elsewhere and paying occasional
visits to the hotel, just as I had done throughout the six
years of war.


As a result of this tenuous relationship there naturally
developed a detachment from the affairs of "The
Marlborough Arms" and, with the temptation that there
was to cash in on the higher market price for hotel
property, the hotel was on the market off and on quite
frequently during the post-war years. That my projected
sale did not come to fruition was due to several factors.
In addition to the sentimental ties of the past, new
sentimental ties had arisen during my post-war stay
with my meeting with Betty—Betty behind the bar—Betty,
the best and most efficient barmaid "The Marlborough
Arms" has ever had—and with the years of
happiness this meeting was bringing to us. A second
factor was the advantageous balance sheet that was now
presented to me regularly, year after year, by Harold
Jones. A third again was my feeling of responsibility
towards those who had helped to pull the hotel through
its difficult time—a sense of responsibility that was to be
so ill requited.


But, as this precarious relationship between the hotel
and myself went on from year to year; as, with the
crystallisation of post-war society, the changes that had
come over "The Marlborough Arms" became more
accentuated, an increasing restiveness came over me. The
advantages of possessing a first class licensed restaurant

So we come to the late summer of 1950 when the
arrangements that had existed over the previous ten years
at last broke down and, as a result of my wife and I—for
Betty and I had been married now for some three
years—giving notice of our intention to take more
interest in the affairs of the hotel, a righteously
indignant manager gave in his notice against what, in
somewhat anticipatory fashion, he termed an "impossible
situation."


(2)


Thus, after the lapse of eleven years, on Saturday,
October 7th, 1950, I became once again an active hotel-keeper.

[p. <i>256</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00260&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Even on an arranged "take-over" a system of dual
control had lasted a bare hour or so, before my able
manager, Mr. Max Ehrsam, and I had found ourselves
to be of incompatible temperaments in the running of a
hotel; and he had gone, accompanied by his friend and
assistant, Mr. Peter Maglioni; and we were left to our own
devices.


"Anyway the hotel's ours at last," said Betty.


Even my home-loving Betty had been drawn by the
lure and glamour of hotel life.


"The Marlborough Arms" was ours indeed—but it
was not to be ours for very long.


However in our brief, glorious burst as hoteliers I,
with the assistance of Ivor Davies who had once again
allied his fortunes to mine on this fresh battleground,
acted as <i>mâitre d'hôtel</i> for a dining room with sittings of
100 or more at each meal, while Betty, returning for a
spell to her previous occupation, made record takings
in the bar.


The pace was indeed a hot one as, first during a weekend,
then during the early days of the succeeding week,
meal followed meal in unrelenting sequence. Breakfast—lunch
— dinner — breakfast — then lunch again — people
coming in and out in endless streams, drinking,
eating, eating, drinking—the intelligent, the beautiful
and the well-bred—and the not-so-well-bred too—in non-stop
sequence—faster and faster. Staff deserted us and
other staff took their place, so that we were able to keep
abreast in this race. It was as if one was performing a
<i>tour de force</i> of juggling—catching in mid-air some
rapidly revolving, and highly fragile piece of mechanism.


Meanwhile over the week-end we had confirmation
of the rumours that had already been circulating—to the
effect that Max Ehrsam was going over to "The Bear,"
scarcely 200 yards away. This worried me very little.
I had been husbanding my resources over the years

[p. <i>257</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00261&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At variance with her usual placid custom, Betty became
more than a little annoyed about the various subterfuges
and pretences that were put up to her. It was, however,
as far as we were concerned, all in the day's work and the
situation was fully salvaged by the fact that the equivalent
number of the staff from "The Bear," apprehensive of
the impending change-over, came across to us, replacing
those who had left.


There were odd circumstances just the same.


And now, amidst the swirl of events, my imagination
began to behave in riotous fashion as the week—both the
current week and our first week of running the hotel—drew
to its close. We were (so, in my imagination, it
seemed) surrounded by spies and conspirators. These
stray, unusual people who were coming in to stay the
night, who could they be but enquiry agents come to
listen to what was said: while the bar seemed filled
throughout the day with other similar characters. And
there was plenty for them to listen to: for I was becoming
unusually talkative. I was talking excitedly throughout
the day. I was talking in conversational fashion mainly,

[p. <i>258</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As the second week-end of our hotel-keeping
approached all other sentiments were, however, overwhelmed
by the oppressive sense of anxiety that weighed
upon us. For here we were—trapped. Trapped by the
exigencies of keeping the hotel going. Surrounded by
strange people in the town that we thought we knew so
well. Our own friends with us, either inexperienced or
bewildered. The world was closing in on us. People were
being poisoned against us: our food was poisoned: all
the drink in the hotel was doped. We were being doped
and poisoned. We couldn't trust anybody. Everybody was
against us. There was no escape.


I have intentionally used the plural throughout the last
paragraph. For here are Betty and I—hitherto a normal
married couple of (if anything) unusually trusting nature
—sitting bolt upright side by side in our double bed in
Number 5 bedroom, communicating with each other by
writing on a pad of paper, afraid to speak to each other
because everything that we said could, we felt, be overheard.
Even a whisper was no longer safe. For I was
writing, "There are microphones installed in these
rooms," while Betty replies, "Are the Post Office keeping
our letters for blackmail?"


The previous day, Saturday, had seen us rushing into
Oxford no less than three times, back and forwards, in
our vain endeavours to escape, to see legal advisers, to
seek what we hoped would be the protection of publicity

[p. <i>259</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00263&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But now, as we lay in bed on Sunday morning, the
closed-in feeling was growing stronger and stronger. We
were trapped within these four walls. And sitting in bed—the
bed which we had occupied so often on previous
occasions—next to each other in broad daylight, afraid
to speak. Then for a while our acute anxiety passed off
and we had breakfast. But we had hardly finished when
here was my poor Betty sitting in the chair opposite to
me, winking her eye in the oddest and grossest fashion
which you ever saw. To this I took strong exception. I
asked her what she was up to. She replied by telling me
her own fears:


"Christiane isn't really dead," said Betty, "She's alive
still. They've disguised her as someone else and are going
to bring her back."


"Nonsense," I said. I had not thought of this one.


But suddenly it occurred to me that, after all, I had had
no positive proof of Christiane's death. I had had to rely
entirely on the kind offices of friends in unusual circumstances.
And I too began to wonder.


Throughout that Sunday our sense of foreboding
stayed with us. Strange demonic forces started to rise
out of the old stones of "The Marlborough Arms"—forces
that enclosed us and that seemed to condition our
own actions and those of everyone about us. These

[p. <i>260</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00264&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But, back at the hotel, people were becoming very
difficult. They no longer seemed to wish to do as I told
them to do. I received scarcely any response to my
instructions about closing down the hotel. As we went
upstairs to change, even Betty was becoming unusually
argumentative.


"Listen to me!" I shouted at Betty at the culmination
of practically the only altercation we have had during
the whole course of our married life.


But then we made it up, weeping in each other's arms,
and I felt very tired and sleepy. As I laid down on the
bed, I felt that I was going to travel a long way.


"I will wake up at ten o'clock." I kept repeating in
automatic fashion, "I will wake up at ten o'clock."


"Darling, you're ill," said Betty, alarmed and disturbed.


I went into a drowsy state. But I woke up before ten
owing to the fact that my friends, being alarmed about
me, had called the doctor. This was the first time, or at
least the first time during this particular illness, that I
saw the doctor. I felt antagonistic towards the doctor—unreasonably
so. I wanted to be left alone.


When the doctor left I relapsed into a drowsy state.
This time I was interrupted by Betty who suddenly,
without warning, rushed across the room and picked up
a golf club and started screaming.


"Come on," I said, "Let's get out of here."

[p. <i>261</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00265&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This ordinary hotel bedroom which we had occupied
at intervals for years seemed no place for either of us
with these odd things happening in it. We both rushed
down to the lower landing, Betty screaming on the way—to
the consternation, so we heard later, of the bar full of
customers downstairs who naturally wondered what was
to do.


We now installed ourselves down on the first floor and
here I spent my last night in the four-poster bedroom in
my long tenure of "The Marlborough Arms." And what
a night! Betty and I once again retired to bed. But this
time we insisted on our friends and relatives, whom I
had gathered round me as a precautionary measure and
with whom I had filled the hotel, staying out on the landing
and watching us.


We did not fail to provide them with entertainment.
When I was not shouting at them, Betty was. And as far
as I was concerned, they were all being extremely
difficult and acting very queerly indeed. While earlier
on I had been jocular and humorous, now in the depths
of the night in these dim passages and bedrooms of this
old-fashioned hotel, the situation became more serious.
Throughout my life I have done my indifferent best to
do what I thought was the right thing—and now in these
unusual circumstances I groped about trying to do the
right thing in order to fend off the evil forces that bid
fair to overwhelm us. It was all desperately serious and I
had to keep on talking and talking to everyone about me,
and saying the right thing.


Here was Ivor with as wild a look in his eye as I have
ever seen him possess, even in the fiercest by-election;
then there was Brother Ken—Betty's brother, Ken—awkward
and "touchy" with an inferiority complex that
stood out a mile. I knew that I had "to butter Ken up"
and tell him what a fine fellow he was. Once or twice I
had some difficulty in finding the words to do this and,

[p. <i>262</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00266&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then next minute there was Betty, once again winking
her eye in leering fashion like an Eastern dancing girl;
and she too had to be kept under control. I did this by
fixing her with my gaze and making her repeat slowly after
me:


"Nice ladies—do—not wink—their eyes. Nice ladies—
do—not—wink—their eyes."


This procedure alarmed Brother Ken considerably,
who wondered what I was doing to his sister. However,
it was successful in getting Betty over her winking turn.
Now she went back to bed and, instead of winking herself,
she began to see the <i>Laughing Cavalier</i> on the opposite
wall winking at her.


"For heavens sake, take that picture down. Take that
picture down," shouted Betty. And the picture had to
come down.


By this time the atmosphere was getting somewhat
close and I went out to sit on the landing and opened the
window on to the courtyard. As I sat looking at the window
curtains, feelings of eerieness and terror came over
me, as I saw them studded with Chinese characters. I
knew, as I sat there; that the final showdown approached,
the final struggle with the forces of darkness in this early
morning light. Elemental forces seemed to rise up from
the floor and hit me; and it was only with the utmost
effort that I repelled them.


"Everything will be all right now," I assured Betty as
I went back to our room.


Everything was all right for almost an hour. We had
agreed by this time that we must go away for a holiday.

[p. <i>263</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00267&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But suddenly, interrupting our talk, Betty zipped out
of bed with a speed and <i>élan</i> which I have never seen her
evince either before or since.


"Let's get out of this hotel. I must get out."


My heart sank as I heard her words. We dressed and
got out of the hotel. But once again we were enclosed and
did not know where to go. There seemed no way of
escape. "They" would be waiting for us wherever and in
whatever direction we went. All we did, in fact, was to go
across to "The King's Arms," walk round the block and
return to the hotel. But now, free from terrors, a strange
sense of uplift and elation came over me. I was on top of
the world. I, too, was no longer one of the ordinary folk. I
was one of the beautiful, the intelligent and the well-bred.
And Betty walking by my side was no longer the humble
person I had known, but here she was disporting herself
like a titled lady.


This was our state of mind when the doctor called,
together with the magistrate, Alderman Morris, J.P., and
other officials. I had expected the doctor. He had called
to see me the previous evening a second time and I knew
he would call again.


"We want you to go away for a rest," said the doctor.


I was not amenable to suggestions of this kind coming
from anyone else. I had, I felt, to talk myself out of this.
I was still arguing at the top of my voice on the pavement
in front of "The Marlborough Arms" when reinforcements
in the form of the Woodstock Police Force, with
Inspector and attendant detectives, arrived. It was as if
one was playing a part in a highly-coloured melodrama,
as one stood at bay, with liberty at stake, in the street of
this quiet country town. Meanwhile the local representatives
of the law quailed somewhat until they discovered

[p. <i>264</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00268&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Betty went to hospital with me in the car, clutching in
her arms the large coloured photograph of our small son,
Norman, as her own protection against the ills that beset
us.


"Look, darling, we have brown crusts round our lips
and our tongues are blue. We must show them that at the
hospital."


However there was not much time to show them anything
at the Warneford Hospital when we arrived. First
of all, I was in the waiting room shouting the odds in loud,
distinctly affected fashion that my wife was "upset".
And by my side was poor Betty, weeping so violently
that it made me forget about the crusts round my lips
and my blue tongue. Then, before I knew where I was,
I was being propelled along corridors by helpers to right
and to left of me. And in a minute I found myself in a
hospital bed with two large young men standing over me.
These were Jock and Pat, as Scots and as Irish as can be
made, who were to be my very good friends for the
coming weeks, though I did not recognize them as such
just then. I was, however, sufficiently sensible to realize
that I ought not to pit myself against unequal forces: and
no one could have been more non-violent than I was.
As I looked round the ward, I seemed to be surrounded
by glaring eyes. As if to protect myself from these, I
put the bedclothes over my face, meanwhile smothering
the feelings of rage that consumed me. Never have I
exercised greater self-control.


Eventually I went to sleep. Or was it sleep? It was more
a dream-like state of coma in which I made my entry into
the western equivalent of a Mohammedan's paradise.
Sexual imaginings of the bawdiest and most intimate kind
ran through my mind like the running through of an

[p. <i>265</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00269&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This continued over the succeeding forty-eight hours,
during which I lost count of time. Indeed time seemed of
no importance. Now and then I would relapse into consciousness
and into what the doctors happily termed my
"paranoiac phase", which alternated in quite inconsequential
fashion with my erotic moods.


"Jock?" I asked.


"Yes."


"Am I in gaol?" At times I thought I was in gaol,
accused of unmentionable offences.


"Gaol?" said Jock. "Gaol? What are you saying, man?
You're in a psychological observation ward."


"Sorry," I said, "I thought I was a prisoner in the
Cold War."


Indeed I took a great deal of convincing that I was not
a prisoner in the Cold War.


"Get on with you" said Jock. "What do you mean,
Cold War? What the blazes have you been doing out there
at Woodstock? Brought a few people in with you, didn't
you? ‘The Marlborough Arms’ is the place for me for
Christmas. You don't want a chucker out, I suppose?"


"Yes," I said, "You've got the job."


I had got away to a flying start in the Refractory Ward
(which was where I now found myself) by virtue of the
number of officials of various kinds I had brought in with
me from Woodstock; and my popularity never looked
back. It was only a matter of keen disappointment to Jock
that we never had a real "set to." He could never quite
comprehend why I preferred to confine my capacities for
making trouble to the strictly non-violent sphere.


Nothing would convince me all the same that I was not
trapped. I was trapped by continental gangsters: I was in

[p. <i>266</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00270&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do you want some tea?" asked saturnine-looking male
nurse, West.


"No, I don't—want—tea." I replied, "I want—bread
—and wine."


West had a habit of keeping his hand inside his white
coat: I was sure that the good, harmless Mr. West, the
friendliest and the mildest soul on the ward as he turned
out to be, was concealing a stiletto in his coat. In these
circumstances my answer seemed to me to be exceptionally
clever.


"You can't kill me" I admonished him, "I have not
received the last Christian rites."


I convinced myself that I had only survived through
my religious sentiments. I was convinced too that my food
was poisoned—not only my own food, but food throughout
the country. It was the visitation of God on an
irreligious country. A punishment of a symbolic nature.
We were delivered to the unbelievers. The Russians, acting
through their agents, had poisoned the bread and
doped the wine so that the whole country was in danger.
There was only one cure. In thoughtful fashion the
authorities had provided me with an excellent dish of
fruit and, I began, after a brief hunger strike, to eat apples.
With each bite of an apple that I took, I began to feel
better in myself and, as I did so, the revelation burst upon
me that there was only one form of salvation for our
country and that was for everyone to eat apples. In my
imagination I was going up and down the land warning
people that they must go into the orchards and eat apples.

[p. <i>267</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00271&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And now, at the end of two days in hospital, my period
of anxiety was over and I was entering a state of revelation.
It was clear to me that these things were happening to me
for some secret, but highly important purpose. Some
powerful secret organization—maybe it was M. I. 5. maybe
it was some organization more powerful still—had taken
me in here from the ken of the world at large for some
special dedicated reason. (What a clever idea, I thought,
to use a mental hospital for this purpose!) This explained
everything. The clouds of frustration that had for so long
overhung my worldly struggles rolled away as I entered
a higher, more celestial plane of existence. As initiation
for this destiny, I was now to be conducted on an expedition
to seek guidance in the remote, mysterious fastnesses
of Central Asia and all these other folk in the ward were
my picked companions, cleverly disguising themselves as
inmates of a mental ward. I spent my time endeavouring
to penetrate their disguises—but I never succeeded in
doing so! In fact, it was occasioning me concern that
there was so much delay in starting. This, however, was
accounted for by the news in the papers that the Dalai
Lama had been forced to leave Lhasa by the advancing
Communist armies. I was now sure that the Dalai Lama
had levitated himself from Tibet to the remoter parts of
Quebec and that the destination of our journey was altered
accordingly. But the projected visit to the Dalai Lama in
his new quarters in Quebec had by this time altered in
character, as well as in destination, and was associated
with primitive religious ceremonies of an orgiastic
character—oddly enough, in these visions, religion and
sex seemed to mingle with each other in harmonious
fashion instead of having the antagonistic features which
they show in our Christian civilization. But then, disappointingly,
our visit to Quebec was delayed too—owing

[p. <i>268</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00272&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, to travel abroad was no longer necessary, as
the Grace of God was descending on me through the
early morning mist. It was an oddity of the weather of the
latter half of October, 1950, that there was a spell of premature
frosty weather. As I lay awake in the early
morning light, with my face up against the bars of the
window adjacent to my bed, I felt the fine cold mist and
breathed the rarified air—air such as I had only breathed
previously in my younger days at the tops of mountains
or in amongst the frosts of Labrador. ("Of course, this is
artificial weather," one of my ward mates assured me a
day or so later and I believed him completely.) I felt
myself in contact with celestial forces and my sense of
destiny and dedication which had withered within me
during the many years since my defeat at Chippenham,
welled up once again. It continued so through the day and
that same evening, as I lay awake in the dark and looked
at the clear sky between the bars of my window, there set
framed between them was (no illusion this, but a veritable
fact) the Constellation of the Plough. I was dreaming
dreams and seeing visions, but in these dreams and visions
I knew I must set my hand to the plough once again.


Meanwhile in the next bed to me I had discovered the
Emperor of the World. Or, at least, he introduced himself
to me as such—though he was, in addition to this, also
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (he had also at one
time been Sir Stafford Cripps); and it was his diverting
habit to conduct his conversation in double-barrelled
capacity expressing his alternative opinions, as the
occupant of his two eminent positions, on every question.
Indeed he was strangely cogent when, as Emperor of the
World, he expounded the course of the world crisis from
an ethnological, a theological and an ontological point of
view, It was a matter of much regret when, having "sipped

During the ensuing week my imaginings continued to
vary from day to day—they became, however, progressively
more grandiose. I was being groomed as understudy
to Sir Gladwyn Jebb as Britain's representative at UNO.
I was being selected as husband for Princess Margaret
and being asked to put away my own wife. I was head of
the British Commonwealth and being compelled to make
a bigamous marriage to appease my Mohammedan subjects—for
this purpose I was now contemplating flight to
the Republic of Andorra. Then I made the remarkable
and happy discovery that my dear Betty was a descendant
of the line of Plantagenet Kings through her ancestor,
the Earl of Warwick, who was, I remembered, the last of
the Plantagenets; and that I was married to one who was
a princess in her own right, working girl as she may have
been. More cogent still, I next discovered myself a lost
descendant of the Stuarts: with the help of the tradition
of my Scottish McIntosh ancestress born at sea, my
family was easily translated into an imagined, non-existent,
issue of Charles Stuart and Flora Macdonald.
With such credentials as these, it was not difficult in turn
to instal myself as President of the World, with my headquarters
at Blenheim Palace and to see Betty and myself
returning to Woodstock in regal state along that strange,
pointless, double carriage way that runs out from Oxford
—the central islands of which, instead of bearing the miscellaneous
shrubs that now occupy them, had blossomed
forth in the bright yellow of the broom, the emblem of the
Plantagenets.


During these imaginings it seemed to me that I still
had to keep on talking, to find the right answers to the
multitude of problems that confronted me in my new

[p. <i>270</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00274&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was at last on the Sunday after my admission on the
Monday that my "tests" culminated in my making perhaps
the best "King's Speech" that has ever been put
across to a loyal and admiring people.


The following day Betty came to see me during visiting
hours. I have never been more pleased to see anyone in
my life, for simultaneously with my illusions I had been
full of very real anxiety for her. She was, I felt, in the
same dreadful danger as I was.


However, she greeted me with her sweet and charming
smile:


"Hello, sweetheart. You're not insane."


"I know," I said, "I'm doped."


"Sh—sh. Don't say that here. They'll keep you here
for ever. And do stop talking rubbish all the time."


"I'm not talking rubbish" I said, "I've learnt a great
deal since being in here. You've no idea."

[p. <i>271</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00275&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I expect I have," said Betty.


Betty and I had not been parted from each other for so
long ever since we had known each other. We kissed joyfully
in our reunion and I told her something of my revelations,
while she in turn gave me some account of her
own experiences and feelings which—oddly enough—had
been not unlike mine.


"Is there anything you want?" she asked.


"Yes," I said dramatically, "I want apples. You must
bring me apples—every day—a fresh supply. You must
eat apples yourself and see that Norman eats apples. Tell
the family to eat apples too."


I do not normally eat apples even when they are put in
front of me. "An apple a day may keep the doctor away",
but as a doctor myself I have scarcely bothered to eat an
apple once in two months. But at this juncture it had
already become my obsession to eat apples. Betty, who
now came to see me daily, would bring me 1 lb. to 1½ lbs.
on each visit and I would consume these and be ready for
more the following day. This obsession with apples continued
for perhaps two weeks, at the end of which time
my appetite for apples dropped to normal and has
remained so ever since.


In the meantime, my Jurgenesque existence of the
previous days was coming to an end and I was beginning
to relate myself to my surroundings in normal fashion.
For, with only two visits from Betty, I had grasped the
position. I had "come to" with a jolt. Not only was
I confined to hospital "at the discretion of the authorities",
but as a result of the certificate admitting me
to hospital I had been removed from control of my
affairs. I was deposed from my small empire; stripped
of my position and my authority; a patient in a
public mental hospital; treated as if I were a pauper
and, indeed, an effective pauper without a penny to my
name.

[p. <i>272</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00276&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For the moment, the absurdity of the situation appealed
to me so much that I laughed out loud. After all, the
whole world had been given to me in these recent days,
so what did I want with money?


Maybe, who knows, I might have remained in this
happy and elevated state? But what brought me to more
realistic thinking was that Betty had no money either and
was in utmost distress at that fact on her daily visits. The
appalling fact hit me that, but for the hospitality of
Brother Ken who had come to the rescue at a time of
crisis, Betty would have been wandering the streets in as
penniless a condition as I was myself. Such little bit of
money as Betty possessed was spent on buying me apples
and other small requirements. She did not have so much
as a penny for anything else.


Maybe it was the shock of this discovery, maybe it was
the apples I was still consuming, but my grandiose ideas
slipped into the background for consideration at some
future date. My phase of visionariness—the only phase
which I have ever had in my life—was over, not to return.
I was now improving rapidly in health day by day. I was
getting out of bed and going for walks—under properly
constituted supervision, of course. As I did so, I had
ample leisure to contemplate the fantastic mediaeval
situation, projected into modern day life, of which I was
the victim. It was as if I had fallen from the top of a high
building, through one floor after the other, until I had
reached the basement where I reposed; and I had now to
essay the tedious climb upwards.


I was only too appreciative of the fact that I was
incarcerated in hospital under mental certification as "a
person of unsound mind". However, as impressions from
the outside world came in on me, I began to put myself
the simple alternative questions. Was I mad and everybody
else sane? Or was I sane and everybody else mad?
Indeed the balance of my judgment came down somewhat

[p. <i>273</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00277&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To make a slip in these circumstances was not difficult.
But I could not afford to make a slip.


No patient has surely been at any time more cooperative
than I was during the remainder of my stay at
the Warneford Hospital. Grateful and obsequious to the
doctors, and respectful of their opinions even when they
were twenty years my junior; obedient to the nurses; cooperative
with the efforts made to distract and amuse me;
I had my reward in turn in rapid promotion. First to the
much-appreciated amenity of a private room, then to the
Convalescent Ward—not nearly so amusing, alas, as the
Refractory Ward had been! In the Convalescent Ward my
latent capabilities as a Bridge player came to my rescue
in a manner which I had never supposed possible. I did
not feel like playing Bridge a bit, but I played so enthusiastically—as
I co-operated in everything else so enthusiastically—that
I won a prize. I had only one moment of
revolt—that was against the well-meaning insistence of
the Charge Nurse that I should take part in Occupational
Therapy activities—Minor Carpentry and Basketwork!
As if I, needed to indulge myself in Minor Carpentry and
Basketwork in order to take interest in life with the problems
that pressed in on me! (It had, after all, been not
without interest for me that very morning to read the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> and to discover <i>Bon Viveur's</i> "lyric
phrases" concerning a meal partaken at "The Bear,"
Woodstock, served by "M. Max." "Give him time," said
<i>Bon Viveur</i>, "M. Max has been there only three weeks
and already custom is trebled." While undergraduate

My medical attendants in their turn viewed this
refractory patient that was myself in a new light of
approval and gratification. From the awkward customer
and prolonged mental illness that they had anticipated,
here I was cured in this remarkably short space of time.


It was on the warmest and most cordial terms with all
concerned that I left the Warneford Hospital six weeks
after my admission, once again in control of my destiny.
Immediately prior to my discharge I was given an
Intelligence Test. At the end of this I was told that I had
scored the highest marks ever recorded by a patient in the
Hospital. I was the Head Boy, so to speak.


Ever since that date I have done my best to live up to
this signal distinction.

My career as a hotel-keeper was over. There was no
doubt about that. I paid occasional visits to Woodstock
to "oversee", but these were of brief duration. The
remaining two and a half months of my nominal ownership,
I left Ivor in charge of "The Marlborough Arms,"
fighting a holding action in as hopeless a contest as he has
ever embarked on even as a Liberal candidate. For, of
course, my able ex-manager, Mr. Max Ehrsam, and his
equally able assistant, Mr. Peter Maglioni, were but two
hundred yards away at "The Bear" and with them by this
time was their so-rapidly-trebled trade. No longer did "The
Marlborough Arms" ring with the fashionable accents of
"the beautiful, the intelligent and the well-bred." They

In the meantime, my own endeavour was twofold.
First, to put and to keep as great a distance as I conveniently
could between myself and Woodstock. Second,
to endeavour to make sense, if sense could be made, out
of the peculiar things that had happened to me.


Correct as were the care and attention that had been
given to me during my illness by all who had had responsibility
for me, I was still filled with a sense of incompleteness.


Alas, my doctors (so it seemed to me) had not understood
me.


After all, I prided myself, I was an interesting case.
And, in conjunction with Betty's case too, we were still
more interesting. It is not every day in the week that a
husband will feel elemental forces coming out of the floor
to hit him, while simultaneously a wife sees pictures on
the wall winking at her. But enthusiasm—that enthusiasm
that had been so much a feature amongst clinicians in
regard to anything out of the ordinary in my hospital
days—for the further investigation of these such unusual
phenomena as these was lacking.


With my dear Betty accompanying me, I decided to
seek further advice. And here further discouragements
awaited. When I came to tell my story, I found myself as
often as not in similar position to that unfortunate gentleman
in the recently-popular song, who found the box upon
the shore. You doubtless know the song, so let us go on.


My distinguished and versatile friend with whom I
first talked (and, indeed, to whom I am deeply indebted)
pointed discreetly to a heading in a text-book, but assured
me that this was not his speciality at all. My friend, the
editor of a well-known medical publication, found himself
altogether too busy for the return lunch which I owed

[p. <i>276</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00280&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I eventually came to consult my titled friend in Harley
Street.


"You'd better write a novel about all this," said my
titled friend in Harley Street.


But since, unfortunately, I am no novelist, I must
discuss it in this autobiography—and with you, my
reader.


Did I go "of unsound mind" through "overwork", as
was alleged? Or for other reasons! And what about Betty?
Did I imagine I was doped: or were my exotic imaginings
attributable to my actually being doped? This was the
fascinating problem which, as a doctor, I set myself to
solve.


Unquestionably I suffered, as my advisers said, from
a "Paranoiac Episode." But Paranoia
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_50471');">[note]</a><div id="_note_50471" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Paranoia—a mental disease entity characterized by intense and unjustifiable
suspiciousness</div>
—from natural
causes—does not strike like lightning from heaven: it is
rather the consequence of a system of ideas of persecution
built up over the years, before it comes to obsess the
personality to an abnormal extent. There is no such
system associated with my own life. Besides my illness
had other features than Paranoia.


Rather, in many ways, does this episode of intense
mental excitement from which I suffered, resemble an
attack of acute mania. The similarity between my own
experiences and those described in such vivid fashion by
Mr. John Custance in his excellent book, <i>Wisdom,
Madness and Folly</i>, impresses me. But mania itself, save
it be of the disease entity of the manic-depressive cycle (of
which again I can present no evidence), can, and indeed
must, be the expression of underlying disorder. Let us

[p. <i>277</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00281&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Acute mental excitement may be a transient phenomenon
in the following conditions," says one of our bestknown
medical text-books,
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_51798');">[note]</a><div id="_note_51798" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗<i>Savill's System of Clinical Medicine</i></div>
"Delirium: alcoholic and
drug intoxication: head injuries: thyrotoxic crises: epilepsy.
Continuous mental excitement is mania."


Since I lay no claim to either head injuries, thyrotoxic
crises or epilepsy, it is at least permissible to look at the
possibilities of drug intoxication as the cause of my
illness—and Betty's illness. Is there a drug that causes
mania? The answer is "Yes, there is." This answer is
found on page 553 of <i>Osler's Principles and Practice of
Medicine</i> under the heading of <b>Hashish—Cannabis
Sativa—Marihuana</b>.


Hashish — cannabis sativa — marihuana — cannabis
indica—Indian hemp. "The weed of madness." "The
drug of laughter." The destroyer of inhibitions. The
guarantor of folly — folly abounding. The creator of
<i>des paradises artificielles</i>. The final proof, who knows, that
God is a humorist, a Chestertonian God Who never tires
of playing pranks with His humble creatures. The subject,
moreover, of leading articles in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
of August 28th, 1951, the <i>Evening Standard</i> of September
5th, 1951 and the <i>Daily Express</i> of November 20th-29th,
1951, which jointly deplore the spread of the drug in this
country. The origin also of a well-known word in the
English language.


Where we have two equally coherent sets of postulates
(so the books of logic tell us) we must appeal to experience.
I do not question the profundity of experience of those
who advised me, but does this, I wonder, include a study
of that excellent document <i>The Marihuana Problem in the
City of New York</i>
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_53483');">[note]</a><div id="_note_53483" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1.<i>The Marihuana Problem in the City of New York</i>, by The Mayor's Committee

<i>A. V</i>. (<i>Male</i>). Given 4 c.c. of marihuana concentrate. About three
hours later he became restless, tremulous, agitated, fearful of harmful
effects, suspicious of examiners. For short periods he was euphoric.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_54463');">[note]</a><div id="_note_54463" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Euphoric—feeling good.</div>
At one time he had visual hallucinations of figures making gestures
suggesting harm. He talked continuously, mainly expressing fear.


<i>W. P</i>. (<i>Male</i>). Given 3 c.c., repeated two hours later. At first there
was a euphoric state, later he became resistant and negativistic.
He showed antagonism to the examiner, demanding to be left alone.
Throughout he was highly excited and talked to himself. The effects
in general resembled those seen in a maniacal state.


<i>F. D</i>. (<i>Male</i>). Given 4 c.c. Five hours later he became confused,
disoriented and slow in answering questions. There were periods
of elation and depression with laughter and weeping.


<i>R. W</i>. (<i>Male</i>). Given 5 c.c. Three hours later he became disoriented
with continued talkativeness. He had fits of laughter and
weeping, grandiose ideas, some paranoid trends.


<i>I. N</i>. (<i>Female</i>). Given 8 c.c. Three hours later she became confused
and anxious with periods of laughing and weeping. There were
several short episodes during which she felt she was dying and
screamed for the doctor and for a priest.

state of anxiety accompanied by a sensation of difficulty in breathing.

These recorded experiments took place in New York,
U.S.A.: my own experiences—and Betty's—occurred in
the centre of England in the year 1950.


Thus I must leave the matter so far as this book is
concerned.
