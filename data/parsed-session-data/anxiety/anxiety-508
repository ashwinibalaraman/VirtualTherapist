BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Well, sir, um, I saw her last on [DATE].  And when I saw her first I said that I was really, really confused about diagnosis.  Um, I usually don't treat anybody unless and until I'm reasonably sure what I am treating.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	So we talked some, we did some paperwork.  And the situation is not clear at all.
<b>PT:</b>	Even once I filled out the paperwork?
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and let me tell you why.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, first, you did [INAUDIBLE] adult ADHD with [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Usually it's says that options are none, mild, moderate, and severe.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It says that if you are in the none or the mild range, then you might have some attention problem but not necessarily have to be treated.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But the way you have suggested on everything you mention at least 2 on the page 1 and page 2, few of them are 1, couple of 3s.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So on an average boils down to score is at least 2 or higher.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That suggests that we should consider that this is an adult ADHD.  Well, we did the testing with the self reports here, which is little bit more convincing.  Here you have very often that it requires a lot of [INAUDIBLE], how can I avoid getting delayed started, kind of procrastination kind of thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You mentioned that that happens really often.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I thought that was just my personality.
<b>DR:</b>	The only thing mentioned that is rare is that how often do you fairly overreact even [INAUDIBLE] to do things, which is the hyperactivity scale.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Those are the ones, that's the one you mentioned rare.  So here you are talking more of ADD—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Than ADHD.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The story doesn't end here because also gave you an handout, the Hamilton anxiety rating scale because if somebody has significant depression he or she can have lack of concentration, can feel scattered, doesn't get the job done, and stuff like that.  So anybody who's presenting with that I may not necessarily conclude that he or she has ADHD.  More common disease is depression.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And depression can cause that kind of problem as well.  Sometimes anxiety, particularly panic—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Can cause that as well, particularly not being able to focus or be productive or complete control.  In the Hamilton anxiety rating scale you scored pretty high again.  And some of the autonomic symptoms it measures, that is that you have some panic off and on.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Like you have tendency to switch, tension, headache, things like that.  And you mention that moderately you get that.  The only thing that you said severe is difficulty in concentration and poor memory.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	If you put all of them together with the testing that you did on day 1, [INAUDIBLE] score, that one is scored pretty high as well.  Your total score on that day, last visit, was 16 plus, there is one more place that you can [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So that also suggests that you are scoring higher on the depression scale as well.  So you are high on depression scale, high on ADHD scale, high on anxiety scale.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And that is confusing because, um, if I treat depression aggressively then depending upon what medication I'm picking can help out the ADHD as well.  But potentially can make the anxiety worse.  If I go gingerly on the depression treatment, then you might not get much relief from either 1 of the 3 diseases.
<b>PT:</b>	Is it possible that my stress is causing the anxiety to be so high though?
<b>DR:</b>	You know, layman's terms is medical terminology is almost synonymous with anxiety.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If you have a very stressful day, what happens?  Say you will have a stressful day, what's happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Like I'm trying to find my new job right now.  I'm, we've taken pay cuts for this new merger.  So that's a lot of stress that boils up in the day.  I go—
<b>DR:</b>	And how does it manifest you?
<b>PT:</b>	At home?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, I'm horrible to live with.  And he will attest to that.  The past 2 or 3 weeks I have been absolutely utterly horrible to him and I know that.
<b>DR:</b>	You have problem with sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Some nights I do, and some nights I don't.
<b>DR:</b>	How about anger?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, I get really angry really quick.
<b>DR:</b>	Sweaty?
<b>PT:</b>	I sweat all the, I will be sitting in a chair and sweating, and yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So those, forget about the stress and job thing, somebody presents that irritable, I'm sweating, I may have a headache or a neck ache, restless, what does it mean?  That's pretty much anxiety.  Right?
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's really confusing at times which route to go.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Based on what I have heard so far only consolation is that I'm not going to make a diagnosis of bipolar disorder right this minute.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that's another one that is so close to ADHD at times it's so [INAUDIBLE] because I cannot differentiate.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	What can contribute as far as at home, when she's good, what's she doing?
<b>CG:</b>	Well, when she's good, I mean, she's laughing, she's joking, but, you know, I mean, just the next second she's pissed.  And it could be, I mean, anything, nothing.  I mean, the other night we were out painting our sunroom, having fun, then the next thing I know she was mad.  I have no idea why.
<b>DR:</b>	Which day was that?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b>	This was this Tuesday?
<b>CG:</b>	That's right.
<b>DR:</b>	Can you identify what made you mad?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm forgetting that.  Did I get mad then?
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.  We were out painting the sunroom and I was, she had finished, we were painting some rails and we were painting the trim and she had finished and I was finishing up and next thing I know she was pissed.  And like I said, I have no idea why.  I just, and I don't know if she realizes it.
<b>PT:</b>	And the smallest things set me off lately so much.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That I can't even remember what the smallest things are.  I know that they are small stupid things though.  I know that in my head.
<b>DR:</b>	When you are upset, you are more crying or more screaming?
<b>PT:</b>	More screaming.
<b>CG:</b>	Screaming.  She doesn't cry a lot.  She'll get, if she gets really, really mad, last night she, last night she was.  She was mad and she was crying a little bit, but, but like I said, it's just, it comes and goes.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Does it have anything to do around this time whether you're having menstrual period?
<b>PT:</b>	It's gotten worse the past week or 2 and I am about to start on my menstrual period, yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you noticed any correlation with that, sir?
<b>CG:</b>	I could say yes, but I don't really know because I don't know exactly when her menstrual period comes and goes because whenever, before all of this really started, even when she was on her menstrual period, she was never bitchy, she was never irritable.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I get really bad now.
<b>CG:</b>	She, I mean, she never used to be.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I really do.
<b>CG:</b>	It's just, I mean, like I said, in the last maybe 2 months, and I know a lot of that, you know, because we've bought a house, we're planning a wedding, her job's giving her a lot of stress, my job's giving stress, I'm fixing to start school, she's fixing to start school, and—
<b>DR:</b>	So you are taking a lot upon your plate?
<b>CG:</b>	Yes.  Yes, we are.
<b>DR:</b>	You are currently on Buspar, I mean, um, Zoloft—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	150 mg at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Buspar 15 mg a day for 2 years?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	You have tried Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Prozac in the past.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The mom is on Cymbalta.  And she's doing well?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't that what you mentioned last time?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's doing good.  I mean, she's doing okay.  I will tell you my mom has an obsessive gambling habit.  I don't know if the medicine fixes that, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it can.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, her mood is fine, but I mean she still has that obsessive gambling addiction.  So it's not helping that.  But I mean it's helping her mood.  She doesn't snap like she usually does.
<b>DR:</b>	Of all these put together and this is a very sensitive question and I'm going to ask it anyway, and I'll tell you why.  If you look at the dynamic of the relationship do you think your relationship is threatened by her ill acting behavior?
<b>CG:</b>	No, because I know it's not her.  I know.  But I—
<b>DR:</b>	Knowing what you know, loving her as much as you do, sometimes we reach a threshold and say I can't do it anymore.
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Have you reached that point?
<b>CG:</b>	Absolutely not.
<b>DR:</b>	How far are you from that?
<b>CG:</b>	Never even crossed my mind.
<b>DR:</b>	So if she is irritable and like that and that happens 3 to 4 times a week, can you handle it?
<b>CG:</b>	I love her no matter what.
<b>DR:</b>	That's separate.
<b>CG:</b>	No, it's, it's part of the same thing.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, but if somebody, the most nearest and dearest person in your life pushes you and pushes you and pushes you, any one of us can reach that line, that I love her very much, but I just can't take it.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, no, because it's, it's not me she's pushing.  She's not pushing me away.  It's, it's the things that irritate her, but she's not pushing me away.  I mean, whenever she gets mad, she doesn't attack me directly, so no, never.
<b>DR:</b>	The reason I ask that question is this.  I am really, really skeptical about using a stimulant to treat ADHD.  I'm asking myself what I can do that I can treat the ADHD some depression and anxiety together—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Without making one of them worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I might not gain a whole lot of ground in the process.  I might have to go slow.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But I will not lose any ground.  That is what I'm prioritizing.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my, and I will tell you, when my, when I am angry with him, it is never with him.  It's with whatever's going on.  Like last night I was just livid and furious because I've come to the point where I'm, cannot find a new job and it's stressing me out.  So my anger was directed not at him, I mean, he caught the end of my anger because of my frustration with the situation, but it's never—
<b>CG:</b>	See, that's what I'm saying, I—
<b>PT:</b>	It's never like, ah, it's your fault that I can't find a job.  It's more just this is frustrating; I'm tired of dealing with this, kind of thing.  And that's really I think the scariest thing for me is that I've always been a person who's been able to control pretty well my emotion and not let things bother me.  I mean I'm one of those people that usually lets things fly.
<b>DR:</b>	Let me ask you this question.  There are 2 ways we can approach this.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm telling you up front the only diagnostic clarification I found today is that you do not have bipolar disorder and everything.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But anxiety is there but not that bad.  My main differentiation is again is it a major depression with unusual features being caused by the stress, or is it ADHD because on both the scale you scored high.  In some situation my ideal pick is Wellbutrin, but I know that you tried Wellbutrin in the past and had nausea and couldn't handle it.
<b>PT:</b>	I would rather try it again 10 years later if that's what you think the best thing's going to be.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you remember the Wellbutrin that you tried, was it Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, or Wellbutrin XR?
<b>PT:</b>	I think it was just regular Wellbutrin.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That makes me a little bit more comfortable because that was one of the reasons original Wellbutrin was taken off of the market because of the side effects.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] do you remember how many times a day were you taking the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b>	Twice.
<b>DR:</b>	The way I'm looking at it is I can do something that completely calm you down, but not necessarily address the disease because if I start any antidepressant it can take anywhere between 2 to 3 weeks—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Before we get the optimum result.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Imagine somebody is depressed need an antidepressant but is also suicidal.  Then what should be the priority?  Should I treat the depression first or should I address the suicidal ideation?  I would address the suicidal first because he or she has to stay alive before I can treat.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	The reason I ask that question is that if you felt pushed and said do something about it, otherwise I would walk out on her, with that kind of situation I can do it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I can give the result within a week.
<b>PT:</b>	I know it takes a while to kick in too.
<b>DR:</b>	There are certain medication, most of the medication we start low and depending upon how you tolerate and how you respond we go up, slowly.  But there is one medication called Depakote—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That can be done in the other way.  We can start on a whopping high dose and the result can be manifested within 5 days.  So why am I so hesitating?  I mean [INAUDIBLE] what I'm going to say.  Depakote is notorious for weight gain.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And it can make you fat or—
<b>PT:</b>	Speaking of that.  I have a question and I don't know if my anxiety and my depression has something to do with it, but for the past 2 months my blood pressure has been ridiculous.  I went to the doctor, to an IBS specialist in [DEIDENTIFIED] about a month ago, it was 144/93.  I got on the treadmill the other day for 3 minutes and after being on it for 3 minutes without even running, my heart rate was up to 187.
<b>CG:</b>	She was busy cooking dinner.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, is that something that is the stress, will the stress do that, or is that like, because blood pressure, high blood pressure runs in my family.  So I don't know if it's because of the stress.
<b>DR:</b>	Did they run any blood test for kidneys and stuff, did they look at your kidney, how they are doing?
<b>PT:</b>	No, but I've had kidney—
<b>CG:</b>	Her kidneys suck.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I've had a million kidney stones.
<b>DR:</b>	Because if kidney stone does not necessarily cause blood pressure problem.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	But in the process if there is damage to the kidney and there is a thing called renin angiotensin system in the kidney.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	That can increase blood pressure.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Well, the only reason I didn't know if it was health like blood pressure related or stress related is because it's really just started in the past 2 months when all of this stuff with my job and everything else has come up.  Like that's really where all of this has started to get bad.
<b>DR:</b>	You are not taking anything for sleep are you?
<b>PT:</b>	No, because I sleep okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she doesn't toss and turn.  She doesn't get up, she maybe—
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, if I get up it's because I have to go to the bathroom.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, she'll get up maybe once a night to go pee and that's it, but she doesn't toss and turn.  She doesn't, I toss and turn more than she does.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know, it's so funny, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], the other day I noticed something.  Like I get up on Saturday and Sunday at seven a.m. no problem, like ready to conquer the world.  On any day I get up and I have to go to work, I don't want to get out of bed.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, the weekends.
<b>PT:</b>	So and like I know with depression usually people just don't want to get out of bed period.  But for me, like on the weekends I'm fine, and I don't know if that's because there's no stress during those 2 days, like I know I can get up those days and do things and be fine.  But like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I mean I even got up fine this morning because I know I don't have to go to work immediately.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you generally speaking you like your job, the present job after all the merger took place?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't.  I hate my job and I have been trying for 2 months to get out of it.  I hate it.  And that's when all of this started.
<b>CG:</b>	That's when all this started was when the merger and everything happened because there was a week, it used to be, you know, I mean, during the week I have to set the bed on fire to get her up, you know.  But on the weekends these last, oh, probably last 6 to 8 weeks, I mean, I'm an early riser, I mean I really am, I'll be up 6:30, 7:00.
<b>DR:</b>	That's your early?
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That's normal for him.
<b>DR:</b>	Why do you tell me that?  I get up usually 4:30 to 5:00.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, my dad gets up at 5:00.  My dad, 6:00 and 6:30 is usually when I'm up, 7:00 at the latest.  But on the weekends she's been waking me up.  And she is in usually fantastic mood on the weekend.  You know, because she's not a morning person at all.  But on Saturday and Sunday, the last couple of months, she's been fine.  You know, she'll get up, maul the crap out of the dogs.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, play with them.  And usually I'm like get away from me, I don't want to play this morning.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  But during the, and during the week, I mean.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, and I still have, I mean, I'll still have my moments on the weekend where something'll happen and I'll get upset.
<b>CG:</b>	But it's not.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's not to the extent it is during the week.
<b>CG:</b>	I think her job has gotten to her.  And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you know, with every other company she's always had this is your job title, this is what you're supposed to do, and right now she's kind of like the company gopher.  You know, she, I mean, they don't give her a specific job to do.  You know, and I think, I think that irritates her because she's always known exactly what it is that she's supposed to do.  And now they're spreading her around.  They want her to do this in this department, this in this department.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean, for instance like when tax season was around, I mean I have a marketing degree and I spent all of tax season picking up dry cleaning, picking up lunches.
<b>CG:</b>	She was basically a page.  She was basically an office page.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, I've gone—
<b>DR:</b>	You've got to be kidding.
<b>CG:</b>	No, no, during tax season she, for lack of a better word, she was the office bitch.
<b>PT:</b>	Pretty much I was.
<b>CG:</b>	She really was.  I mean, she—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, we need, somebody needs their medicine picked up at the pharmacy.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean, she went—
<b>DR:</b>	Nobody in the office supposed to do that.
<b>CG:</b>	During tax season that's what she did and—
<b>DR:</b>	What's so special about tax season?
<b>PT:</b>	Because I work in an accounting firm.
<b>CG:</b>	She works for an accounting firm.
<b>PT:</b>	And so they're all too busy to go do, I went grocery shopping for people.
<b>CG:</b>	She did their dry cleaning, she did everybody's lunch, and—
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, so that's a lot of it too I think is that I went from having a really good career where I was respected—
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	And did wonderful things, you know, borderline award winning brochures that almost won awards, to what I'm doing now.  Which basically when I go to work now, like I called [DEIDENTIFIED] the other day which is where our new corporate headquarters are and I was like, well, um, you know, I really don't have anything to do, you know, is there something you can send me.  Well, we need somebody to proof the annual report, but I just don't know if the team's going to agree to us sending that down there for you to do.  Why?  I worked at a newspaper; I have a degree in public relations and journalism.  I know how to write.
<b>CG:</b>	She proofreads all of my papers.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, I proofread everybody's stuff in the office.  And then I designed an ad the other day, a classified ad, sent it to them, they sent it back and said I needed to use the one they sent instead which was basically an identical copycat of mine, only a few words were moved around.  I mean, it's just like I don't have to be in control.  I'm not a control person.  But my thing is when I have all these skills and talents and I can't use them, like when I sat down to do that ad the other day, I had to power through because it had been so long since I'd sat in front of graphic design software I had to remember, you know, it's one of those skills that if you don't use it you lose it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you get rusty.
<b>PT:</b>	And so I honestly think that's a lot of it too.
<b>CG:</b>	And I think a lot of her, also is the fact that she doesn't have anything to do during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I go to work every day and play on my iPhone for 8 hours because they monitor our Internet activity so I can't play on the Internet.
<b>CG:</b>	And we text message each other, we text message each other [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	But at the same time I mean there's literally nothing for me to do.  I mean, nothing.  I went in yesterday.
<b>DR:</b>	Then why are they paying you then?  Why they are not [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	I honestly think it's, because they wanted to keep their whole we're a good company front.  They didn't fire anybody, but everybody got shuffled around to positions they don't, we had a lady who quit accounting, didn't want to do accounting anymore so she was the office administrator.  Well, who did the bills and everything, she didn't want to do accounting, she was done with it, she's a CPA.  Well, now that they've merged, they pushed her back into director of auditing role which is where she never wanted to be.  But they didn't want to be the company that said we're going to let you go, here's your severance package.
<b>DR:</b>	But pushing you so that you quit.
<b>PT:</b>	I think that's what they're doing.
<b>CG:</b>	That's what they'll try and do I think.
<b>PT:</b>	And a lot of people think that's what they're doing to them.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, they're just going to make it miserable.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let's do it this way.  Um, I will back off on the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	From 150 mg to 100 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I am trying to get you off of the Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you are on the Zoloft for as long as you did, if I abruptly stop it you can go through what we call serotonin withdrawal.
<b>PT:</b>	Even though I've been off it for 4 weeks?
<b>CG:</b>	She's been off it, yeah, she's been off it.
<b>DR:</b>	You are not taking the Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I haven't had Zoloft in 6 weeks.
<b>CG:</b>	She hasn't had it in 6 weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Remember, the guy, the [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] guy wouldn't give me anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's why—
<b>DR:</b>	Past 1 week what have you been taking?
<b>PT:</b>	Nothing.
<b>CG:</b>	Nothing.
<b>DR:</b>	And have you noticed any difference in the process that she is off medicine?
<b>CG:</b>	It's, it's getting progressively worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  That makes life a little bit easier because [INAUDIBLE] how it will—
<b>CG:</b>	The fuse is getting shorter and shorter.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm going to give you, um, Depakote some, and I'm going to give you sample.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That will calm you down right away.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And I want you to start Wellbutrin XL.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Which will be addressing the depression as well as the ADHD and as we go along I will take you off of the Depakote.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, when I start Wellbutrin, first of all you be able to tolerate or not given the past history of nausea that's one thing in my mind.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Number two, how many mg would you need and these things might take 2 to 3 weeks to figure it out.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And I just don't want this gentleman to suffer, do you?  So I'm giving you a pill—
<b>CG:</b>	What you have to realize, doctor, is I was the oldest of 5 and I had 3 sisters and my mother who all had their cycles at the same time.
<b>PT:</b>	So he's been through hell.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're a pro.
<b>CG:</b>	I am a pro in dealing with bitchy attitudes.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Female emotions.
<b>CG:</b>	That's right.  That's right.  And my—
<b>DR:</b>	I think you deserve some relief.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And given the, but none of these, neither Wellbutrin nor Depakote are really known to help people sleep.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	There are 2 variables I can quickly take control of.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	One is explosive anger and the other one is good quality sleep.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Six to 8 hours of sleep may not necessarily always mean that you slept well.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It is not the quantity or the length of the sleep that makes the difference, quality matters as well.  If you really, really get physical and mental rest during sleep then it helps a lot next morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you are not starting handicapped.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So I'm going to give you some benzodiazepine, a sleeping pill plain and simple, at night.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And that I will give you a prescription.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin XL I don't have any, uh, samples, I have to give you a prescription as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	But I have Depakote that I'm going to give you some samples.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You take 1 Depakote at nighttime—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And 1 sleeping pill at nighttime.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Wellbutrin XL 1 of them in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	One whole pill?
<b>DR:</b>	Correct.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	And on the sleeping pills, do I need to like watch out for the sleepwalking because?
<b>DR:</b>	If it happens let me know because at this day and age certain sleeping pills, particularly Ambien.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, see I've heard that people were—
<b>DR:</b>	But I'm not going to give you Ambien because it is not a true benzodiazepine.  I'm thinking a true benzodiazepine because that can help you with anxiety component as well.  [INAUDIBLE] pill during daytime.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So summary will be because you're off, not taking Zoloft, so we are not going back, number 1 and I assume you are not taking BuSpar either.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So we are not going back that.  We are starting Wellbutrin XL.  It can be treat for depression and ADD.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Depakote at nighttime, so you take the pill, he feels better.  The sleeping pill at night.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll see you in 2 weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Questions?
<b>CG:</b>	Um.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think that a lot of it's probably job related?
<b>DR:</b>	A significant component of it.  If you have seen me the first time ever a week ago then I probably would say no medicine please, let's just go for psychotherapy and relax [INAUDIBLE], blah, blah, blah.  But given the past history you have given me I cannot ignore what happened in the past when the stress was not there.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So the way I'm interpreting that it is not created by the stress, but it is aggravated by the stress.  See our original disease was already there and it was kind of subtle.
<b>PT:</b>	I was telling [NAME OTHER] that.  I said when I was on my medicine I think that you don't notice still the quirky things you do.  Do you know what I mean?  Like I sure I had minor little outbursts, but being off of it, and even not until anybody asks you about it, you don't notice about it, because I was telling her once she asked me how quickly my mood changed or how, you know, I didn't notice that until somebody brings it up.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, the job situation is worse, so it is adding to the stress.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And you are off of the medication for as long as you are, and so, you know, all the wrong things that can happen is happening.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.  Should I go see somebody about my blood pressure or wait and see if the medicine helps calm it down?
<b>DR:</b>	Why don't you wait for about a week or so.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If you get decent sleep, restful sleep, if that doesn't bring down the number, then you need to see someone.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Awesome.  Well, thank you, doctor.  Do you feel better now?
<b>CG:</b>	I was, I'm worried about you.  I mean, I worry about my safety a little bit but I would not expect that.
<b>DR:</b>	Do I need to check out if you have a cracked head or broken bones ?
<b>CG:</b>	Broken limbs or something.  No, that is the one thing about her.  I do not have to worry about her getting up at night because she, I've never seen anybody fall asleep so fast.
<b>PT:</b>	I get that from my dad.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  I mean, I lay awake for, you know, half hour to 45 minutes every night, but her, I mean, it's head hits the pillow she's out.
<b>PT:</b>	I have you and [NAME OTHER] pretty much on the same cycle of visits, should I do her one week and you the other?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes, that's much, much more desirable.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	From the clinical standpoint.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I figured.
<b>DR:</b>	And the financial standpoint.
<b>PT:</b>	That's what I figured was that that way you guys could compare notes if needed.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like one of those people I read about in all my psych classes.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, just think this semester I could use you as my case study.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure.
<b>CG:</b>	I'm going to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	The Wellbutrin must be taken in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And by any chance you forgot and it's about 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening, don't take it.
<b>PT:</b>	Don't take it.  It'll keep you awake, won't it?  Yes.
<b>CG:</b>	Now between that and, uh, the other one, not the sleeping pill, is there any side effects that I need to be looking for?
<b>DR:</b>	Um, the nausea vomiting.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	As you got flu or something.
<b>CG:</b>	Gotcha, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Now is the Wellbutrin XL, is that a time released or is it just?
<b>DR:</b>	Time release [INAUDIBLE].  Depakote ER is a time release, you cannot break or cut.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Restoril comes in capsule form so you cannot break or crush.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So no cutting and sharing with your loved ones.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's not like one of those, because I've taken, you know, antidepressants before where if you take it, it hits you so hard right up front I'd almost get antsy.
<b>DR:</b>	No, [INAUDIBLE] that's why I'm not going on the regular Wellbutrin or the SR.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The history that you've had, that's why they aborted that.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, I just wanted to see.  Because I will tell you that's the most annoying thing about when they used to change my medicine is that some of them would just, you take it and that first hour or 2 it'd be like you were, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	On speed or something.
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I wanted to see you in 2 weeks but all of a sudden I remembered that week I'll be out of town.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So it would move to 3 weeks, so the nurse can look it up in the front.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Well, and if we do 3 weeks that'll put you and [NAME OTHER] on an every other week.  Because I saw her this Monday.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Then let's go for the 3 week deal.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	This is your Restoril 15 mg 1 at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Any time you are starting a sleeping pill first few days watch it out how you are doing.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So I would prefer today being Thursday that you start it on Friday night.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	In case you oversleep that you, you know, you don't have to hop up in the car and stuff like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Wellbutrin 150 in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you can start tomorrow morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Depakote I am going to give you the sample, you start it tonight, 1 of them.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  And that's right before I go to bed, like I usually go around 10:30?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's fine.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Anything else?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think there is.
<b>DR:</b>	And give this to the girls in the front.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll meet you there with the samples.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Thank you, sir.
<b>DR:</b>	And thank you for letting me record it.
<b>CG:</b>	Thank you very much.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, no problem, no problem at all.
