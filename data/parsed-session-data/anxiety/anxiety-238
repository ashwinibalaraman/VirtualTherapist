<font size="4"><b>Chapter 16: The Acute Myocardial Infarction Coping Model: A Midrange Theory</b></font>

The Acute Myocardial Infarction
Coping Model (Alonzo &amp;
Reynolds, 1996a, 1996b, 1997,
1998) provides a framework for understanding
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) careseeking
behavior (see Figure 16.1). In this
model, it is proposed that the relatively neglected
areas of emotional response and social
situation are key elements in understanding
why individuals may delay seeking definitive
health care services following the onset of lifethreatening
AMI symptoms. This chapter provides
an overview of the origins and key elements
of the model and an analysis of its utility
for nursing research and practice.


- <b>ORIGINS</b>


It has been well established that to receive
maximal benefit from thrombolytic therapies,
individuals who are experiencing an AMI
must obtain treatment rapidly. Prompt action
not only reduces the mortality rate but also
preserves heart function (Berger et al., 1994;
Weaver et al., 1993). Even though the advantages
of rapid AMI treatment are clear, the
time from the onset of acute symptoms of
AMI to definitive emergency care is often
protracted, and individuals with a prior history
of AMI or coronary artery disease
(CAD) or both are particularly apt to extend
care seeking (Bleeker et al., 1995; Bury et al.,
1992; Kenyon, Ketterer, Gheorghiade, &amp;
Goldstein, 1991; Roth, Herling, &amp; Vishlitzki,
1995; Wallbridge, Tweddel, Martin, &amp;
Cobbe, 1992). Although AMI care-seeking
delay has been studied frequently, it is not
well understood (Wielgosz &amp; Nolan, 1991).
Rather than examining the prehospital period
as a time when the individual must actively
cope with a difficult-to-assess acute health

[p. <i>412</i>]

Research completed in nursing thus far
demonstrates how difficult it may be for patients
to accurately interpret their AMI symptoms
and determine whether to seek care. For
example, atypical presentation of cardiac
symptoms (Lee, 1997; Lee, Bahler, Taylor,
Alonzo, &amp; Zeller, 1998), a mismatch between
symptom expectations and actual symptoms
experienced (Johnson &amp; King, 1995; Scherck,
1997), and failure to experience or appraise
symptoms as serious (Dempsey, Dracup, &amp;
Moser, 1995; Dracup &amp; Moser, 1997; Reilly,
Dracup, &amp; Dattolo, 1994; Scherck, 1997)
have been found to delay AMI care seeking.
Although this research provides important insight,
there has been minimal consideration of
how emotional and social situational processes
may influence AMI symptom interpretation
and care-seeking behavior.


In the AMI coping model, the problem of
extended care seeking during AMI is conceptualized
within a broad inclusive theoretical
framework that considers the multidimensional
features of care seeking and coping and
focuses specifically on the importance of
emotions and the social situation. The four-phase
model was inductively and deductively
derived (Alonzo &amp; Reynolds, 1996a, 1996b)
from an analysis of empiric and theoretic literature,
which concerns mainly self-regulation
theory (Leventhal, 1980; Leventhal &amp;
Cameron, 1987) and Mead's (1938) conceptualization
of the "act." The phases of the AMI
coping model are in essence a synthesis of the
two conceptualizations as applied to AMI
coping. The "act" is a way of conceptualizing
the primary structure of our ongoing, emergent
social behavior (Mead, 1938). In the
Self-Regulation Model, Leventhal and colleagues
(Leventhal, 1980; Leventhal &amp;
Cameron, 1987) suggest a conceptualization
similar to Mead's in which individuals cope
with symptoms of illness within a self-regulative
systems model. Both conceptualizations
emphasize that relevant self-monitoring information
is processed over time.


Since its initial development (Alonzo &amp;
Reynolds, 1996a, 1996b), the AMI coping
model has been further refined to consider in
more detail the role of emotions and coping,
the potential of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), and related problems in response to
the experience of AMI (Alonzo &amp; Reynolds,
1997, 1998), and the influence of cumulative
adversity (Alonzo, 1998, 1999).


- <b>ELEMENTS OF THE
AMI COPING MODEL</b>


<i><b>Coping</b></i>


In the AMI coping model, the individual
is viewed as an active problem solver who engages
in conscious, and intentional, cognitive
and behavioral efforts to manage specific external
or internal demands or both that are appraised
as taxing or exceeding the resources
of the individual. This view is consistent with
conceptions of coping described by Leventhal
and Cameron (1987), Lazarus and Folkman
(1984), and Mead (1938). In the AMI model,
particular emphasis is placed on the relationship
that the individual has with both internal
and external environments, namely, his or her
body and the surrounding socially defined situation
as described by Ball (1972). Coping efforts
are regarded as either problem focused
or focused on emotional regulation (Leventhal
&amp; Cameron, 1987), where problem-solving
efforts are viewed as attempts to do something
constructive about stressful conditions and
emotion-focused coping is viewed as an effort
to regulate the emotional consequences of
the stressful event. In both coping circumstances,
internal biophysiological and emotional
stressors produced by the experience of
symptoms have exceeded the resources of the
individual (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) and
become a taxing and potentially traumatic experience
(Goldberger, 1983). The process of
attempting to restore balance in the situation
of an impending AMI is conceptualized in

[p. <i>413</i>]

<i><b>Phases of Coping</b></i>


<i>Phase I: Impulse and
Cognitive Recognition</i>


The primary substantive process of Phase
Ins symptom recognition and labeling. Phase I
begins when the individual experiences a
symptomatic impulse or stimuli that distinguishes
itself from background expectancies
(Alonzo, 1979) and that exceeds normal expectations
in a manner compelling enough
that it is not easily ignored. The labeling process
requires that symptoms are placed within
an understandable framework or, as Leventhal
(Leventhal, 1980; Leventhal &amp; Cameron,
1987) suggests, an illness representation â€” the
cognitive structure by which individuals organize,
analyze, and interpret information.


Memories are thought to be a significant
aspect of illness representations. Memories
reflect the individual's past experiences and
include affective, emotional responses, such
as those associated with AMI, and the more
common abstract and conceptual information
about symptoms and signs provided by health
care professionals or associations (e.g., the
American Heart Association's, 1992, warning
symptoms of a heart attack). Illness representations
involve beliefs about possible associated
symptoms, the cause of the disease, how
long it lasts, how it might be treated and
cured, and likely sequelae (see Chapter 20,
this volume).


Phase I ends when the individual has a
tentative label or a hypothesis regarding the
meaning of the symptoms and proceeds to address
the demands of the symptom representation
in terms of developing a coping strategy.
Central to developing a strategy are knowledge,
behaviors, and efforts to regulate emotional
arousal (Alonzo &amp; Reynolds, 1998).


<i>Phase II Perception and
Covert Action Plan</i>


The primary process in the second phase
is covert construction, manipulation, and assessment
of strategies to cope with symptoms.
Covert coping means constructing a "line of
action" (Blumer, 1969) directed toward establishing
a stable relationship with symptoms
and what Mead (1938) referred to as the
"collapsed act," meaning that the individual
engages in covert reflective analysis to determine
how to achieve restoration of equilibrium.


In the case of symptoms, the individual
examines his or her environment for possible
causes, explanations, consequences, remedies,
strategies, or all of these to make them
stable and predictable. In this context, predictable
and stable mean that symptoms will be
lessened in intensity or frequency, made predictable
in terms of their reoccurrence or being
associated with a treatment regimen,
brought below an acceptable threshold of attention
or emotional arousal, or all of these.
For Mead (1938), the collapsed act is a "subjective
substitute for an objective reality"
(p. 122) with which one anticipates having
contact. In the current context, if the individual
perceives signs and symptoms to be of a
noncardiac, respiratory problem, his or her covert
coping activities could include thinking
about using an inhaler (if he or she is an
asthma patient) or possibly calling a friend
who sometimes complains of shortness of
breath for information. Alternatively, if the individual
is a cardiac patient, he or she may
try to recall a prior cardiac event and mentally
run through his or her past symptoms, problem
solving, and resources, whether lay or
medical.


As the result of symptoms and covert
coping, the individual is now in a new and
more sensitive relationship with his or her environments
(biophysical, social situational,
psychological or cognitive, and emotional).
Covert action requires the use of knowledge
and perceived behavioral resources immediately
available to the individual, more distant

Phases of the Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Coping Model</div>
[p. <i>415</i>]

<i>Phase III: Overt Manipulation</i>


Phase III is characterized by overt behavior,
manipulation, and recursive reassessment.
Manipulation is the locus of reality for Mead
(Natanson, 1956) and can prove to be extremely
time-consuming (Alonzo, 1980; Hartford,
Karlson, SjÃ¶lin, Holmberg, &amp; Herlitz,
1993). In essence, the coping line of action
constructed covertly is now implemented, and
in so doing the individual is constantly testing,
revising, and reconstructing lines of action.
As symptoms evolve, change, or reoccur,
and if overt manipulation is not effective, the
processes of impulse relabeling and covert actions
are revisited and can occur simultaneously
as the individual and lay others attempt
to manipulate the environment to cope
with the stressful event of symptoms and
emotional arousal.


Covertly constructed behavioral strategies
are overtly implemented to establish a
predictable and stable relationship with the
symptoms. As overt coping develops, the individual
and lay others are constantly evaluating
whether instrumental efforts and resources are
effective, whether available information is accurate
and consistent with their ongoing experiences
and representations, and whether
emotional and affective responses to symptoms
and the emerging coping efforts are under
control and, particularly for lay others, not
blocking instrumental coping and assessment.
If, in the course of behavioral coping, problems
or additional impulses occur, the individual
may return to Phases I and II to modify his
or her illness representations, behavior,
knowledge, or emotional regulation so that
consummation can occur.


Following up on the prior respiratory example
of Phase II, if the signs and symptoms
are not responding to a respiratory regimen,
the individual and those around him or her
will return to Phases I and II to relabel signs
and symptoms and to construct a new or modified
strategy for coping with the signs and
symptoms. The process is recursive in that it
continues until some sense of stability or equilibrium
is reached, whether clinically appropriate
or not.


<i>Phase IV: Assessment
and Consummation</i>


In Phase IV, or the consummatory phase,
the primary process is the experience of fulfillment
or restored equilibrium, fulfillment of
covertly constructed strategies, and reduced
emotional and affective arousal. Although the
assessment and consummation phase conceptualizes
the process of restored equilibrium, in
a real sense it is an analytic point that is used
to highlight the outcome of coping with a single
discrete illness event that has occurred
within the life course and flow of life course
events (Alonzo, 1999). On consummation, the
AMI event has been contained by available resources
(e.g., stabilizing care obtained in the
emergency department) and a measure of
equilibrium achieved. In actuality, the individual
and others will continue to cope with the
consequences of an AMI for a long time.


<i><b>Emotions and Coping</b></i>


Each of the phases described previously
combines the Meadian and Leventhal conceptions
of how individuals cope with a traumatic,
turbulent experience in a self-regulatory
action scheme. Emotions are thought to
have a particularly profound influence on
AMI care-seeking behavior. Emotions are regarded
as having an involuntary, compelling
quality that is mediated through the individual's
perception and the situational response
to emotions (Safran &amp; Greenberg, 1991).
Emotions can be a product of genetically programmed
states of arousal and socialized sentiments
(Gordon, 1981) that are situationally
connected and biophysically independent. At
the fundamental organismic and biopsychological
level of processing, there is a very basic
primary, even primal, response to symptoms

[p. <i>416</i>]

If we view individuals as being in social
situations and assume they desire a stable social
identity (Robinson &amp; Smith-Lovin,
1992), then we can understand individuals'
cognitive response to symptoms, especially if
we assume the primacy of desiring to maintain
social situational engagement and participation.
MacKinnon (1994) aptly summarizes
an appropriate basic understanding of responses
to AMI: "[E]motions are episodic,
situationally instigated, ephemeral affective
experiences with physiological and cognitive
components.... [Emotions] are cognitive signals,
rich in affective meaning, that inform
people how they are doing in establishing and
validating situated identities in social interaction"
(p. 31).


Integrating the strands of emotional conceptualizations
from symbolic interaction inspired
affect control theory, and Leventhal's
(1980) emotion component of self-regulation
theory, the convergent point appears to be that
emotions are a consequence of a discrepancy
between what the individual expects to occur,
to experience, to be perceived as, or to engage
in and what is actually experienced. In a
sense, experiencing symptoms of AMI is a
discrepancy in bodily and health expectations
in situationally meaningful settings. In
Leventhal's conceptualization, the violation
of social and emotional schematic expectations
is a "critical source of affective experiences
and reactions" (p. 187). Emotions come
from both the deviation from expectation and
the specific meaning of the stimulus. Emotions
are thus an evaluation of some part of the
world in relation to oneself (Franks &amp; McCarthy,
1989) or, as Hochschild (1990) suggests,
in relation to bodily sensations. In a very real
sense, symptoms of an AMI and their potential
meaning and consequences represent a
turbulent, traumatic stimuli that arouses in the
individual, and those around him or her, a
level of emotional responsiveness requiring
an adaptive coping strategy to regain a sense
of comfort, normality, or restored situational
sentiments regarding the self.


<i><b>Prior History of AMI
and Emotional Coping</b></i>


Interestingly, individuals with a prior history
of AMI and coronary heart disease
(CHD) do not tend to seek time-dependent
medical care during subsequent episodes of
acute coronary disease faster (and frequently
do so more slowly) (Bleeker et al., 1995;
Leitch, Birbara, Freedman, Wilcox, &amp; Harris,
1989) than individuals who have not experienced
a first AMI (Bleeker et al., 1995; Bury
et al., 1992; Kenyon et al., 1991; Roth et al.,
1995; Turi et al., 1986; Wallbridge et al., 1992).
This is problematic because these individuals
are at far greater risk for death (Gruppo Italiano
per lo Studio Della Streptochinasi Nell'infarto
Miocardico, 1992) and increased morbidity.
One would expect that prior knowledge and
emotional and behavioral experiences would
enhance sensitivity and responsiveness to recurrent
AMI symptoms; this is often not the
case. When this phenomenon is considered

[p. <i>417</i>]

Individuals with a history of ischemic
heart disease have episodic or autobiographical
memories (Leventhal &amp; Cameron, 1987)
of prior responses to and experiences with
symptoms of AMI and CHD diagnostic procedures
and their potential meanings and consequences.
These experiences may interfere
with and preclude expedient care seeking for
the following reasons. First, individuals with
preexistent disease may have an idiosyncratic
illness representation. They may be more
likely to mislabel symptoms and signs of subsequent
AMIs (Hartford et al., 1993) and find
difficulty determining whether they need care
(Meischke, Ho, Eisenberg, Schaeffer, &amp; Larsen,
1995), especially if new symptoms are not
similar to previous ones (Johnson &amp; King,
1995).


Second, those who have had an AMI and
who have participated in cardiac rehabilitation
may engage in longer periods of evaluation
because the rehabilitation process may
encourage a sense of optimism, efficacy, and
invulnerability (Wielgosz, Nolan, Earp, Biro,
&amp; Wielgosz, 1988). Rehabilitation may contribute
to what Weinstein (1988) terms an
"optimistic bias," wherein cardiac patients erroneously
believe that their own risk is less
than that of others because of their participation.
Weinstein further indicates that the
source of this optimism could also be incorrect
information, a need to sustain self-esteem
and, as noted previously, to sustain situational
participation, or both.


Third, some individuals (as many as
25%; Kutz, Garb, &amp; David, 1988; Kutz,
Shabiai, Solomon, Neumann, &amp; David, 1994)
may experience a form of Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Hanson, 1990) and/
or reactive and secondary alexithymia, a disorder
characterized by psychic numbing and
inability to process symptomatic information
(Taylor, Bagby, &amp; Parker, 1991; von Rad,
1984). The experience of an AMI may be similar
in many respects to the reported experiences
of assault, domestic abuse, and combat
survivors and so on (Wilson, 1984). Individuals
with PTSD demonstrate intrusion of past
experiences, a desire to avoid stimuli associated
with past experiences, increased
psychological arousal or hypervigilance, and
psychic numbing or ideational constriction
(Horowitz, Wilner, &amp; Alvarez, 1979).


There are three traumas of AMI that may
contribute to PTSD-like symptoms or alexithymia
or both. First is the primary trauma of
the insult to the myocardium or heart muscle
and related symptoms and signs. Social psychologically,
there is the fright and overwhelming
dread of the potential loss of life
and of social control, of the breakdown of social
situations, of a diminished continuity of
life, and of future expectations and the assault
on ones social identity across many domains.
The outcome of an AMI may leave the individual
with angina pectoris, or chest pain with
exertion, and other disabilities. In addition,
and a very significant part of medical treatment,
are the relatively invasive experiences
of coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty,
angiography, pacemaker implantation, stress
testing, and the numerous side effects of cardiac
medications. In essence, the individual
is now diagnosed as having a potentially fatal
and life-threatening, possibly terminal, chronic
disease.


Next, there are secondary traumas of experiences
in accessing and using emergency
medical services (EMS) or dialing 911, calling
a physician, entering the emergency department
(ED), and experiencing hospitalization.
Over the long term, becoming a cardiac
patient, going through cardiac rehabilitation,
changing work and lifestyles, and experiencing
repeated physician consultations and medical
regimens can become part of the secondary
trauma of AMI. Last, at the tertiary level,
there are many stressful mini-events of being
a patient in the modern health care system.
These small but cumulative traumas are the
administrative hassles associated with health
insurance, workmen's compensation and
other disability insurance, hospital and physician
billing services, and, if eligible, Medicare
and Medicaid.


Individuals who experience repeated
traumas are particularly apt to demonstrate a
range of maladaptive coping. Fullilove, Lown,

[p. <i>418</i>]

Considered within the AMI model of
coping, it can be seen that emotion-focused
coping impaired by PTSD-like symptomatology
or alexithymia could inhibit a timely
response to symptoms of AMI within a self-regulatory
process. Whether the individual experiences
the avoidance of PTSD or the
numbness of reactive alexithymia, the result is
a dissociative response that obstructs the application
of knowledge or the use of problem-focused
coping that might facilitate expeditious
arrival at the ED during subsequent
AMIs or other cardiac events. Furthermore,
the traumatogenic potential of AMI may have
implications for maladaptive coping during
subsequent ischemic events and other
comorbidities over the life course (Alonzo,
1998, 1999).


- <b>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE</b>


Consistent with the emphasis of nursing, the
AMI coping model stresses the client perspective
and the importance of the social situation.
The model suggests that an understanding
of the clients' response to the threat of
AMI is ascertained by understanding their
perceptions or implicit models of the threat
that may be particularly influenced by prior
experiences with the threat of AMI or other
chronic health problems or both, priorities
strongly influenced by the home context, and
untoward emotional reaction.


As represented in Figure 16.2, this framework
provides guidance for the development
of intervention strategies to reduce care-seeking
delay. This conceptualization suggests
that if individuals in the midst of the potentially
traumatic experience of AMI (particularly
those with histories of AMI and CHD)
are to call the EMS or arrive at hospital EDs
sooner, interventions, whether at the individual
or community level, should take into consideration
three elements derived from self-regulation
theory and the Meadian conceptualization
of the act (Leventhal, 1980;
Leventhal &amp; Cameron, 1987; Mead, 1938).
First, knowledge is needed by the individual
and lay others to correctly label symptoms
(typical and atypical) as indicative of an AMI.
Second, it is necessary to provide feasible behaviors
that individuals and lay others can engage
in to access definitive medical care (e.g.,
dialing 911). Last, and perhaps most important,
it is necessary to provide an understanding
of, and skills to cope with, the primary
emotional arousal in regard to the traumatic
experience of AMI symptoms. It must be understood
that the knowledge and behaviors
necessary to obtain effective care may contribute
to emotional arousal and paralyze
timely action. Thus, the secondary and tertiary
arousal engendered by knowledge and
behaviors necessary to construct a strategy to
cope with the acute AMI illness experience
and potential consequences must be addressed.


Issues discussed previously are also relevant
to the clinical setting in the early phases
of clinical assessment. Although a certain
amount of dissociative behavior may be beneficial
in the early phases of AMI hospitalization
(Croyle &amp; Ditto, 1990; Esteve, Valdes,
Riesco, Jodar, &amp; de Flores, 1992; Flowers,
1992; Kenyon et al., 1991), continued anxiousness,
depersonalization, and dissociation
could be considered indicative of a form of reactive
posttraumatic stress syndrome and cumulative
adversity syndromes. This assessment
would be especially appropriate among

FOR RESEARCH</b>


The model has not been directly tested. To
date, support has been derived by systematic
review of extant literature and empirical studies
supporting self-regulation theory and the
Meadian conception of the act (Alonzo &amp;
Reynolds, 1996a, 1996b, 1997, 1998). From
the basic set of conceptualizations, the following
propositions are derived:

applied to strategic points in the

The model lends itself to both qualitative
and quantitative approaches to understanding
the care-seeking behavior of individuals experiencing
an AMI. That is, the model is useful
with approaches that focus on the
phenomenological experience of the individual
client and with approaches that focus on
understanding responses across individuals.
To understand more fully why sociodemographic
variables have not proved to be useful
in understanding AMI care-seeking (Dracup
et al., 1995), special attention should be given
to important subgroups, such as women, the
elderly (Turi et al., 1986), and ethnic and racial
minorities (Maynard et al., 1991). As previously
noted, individuals with a prior history
of AMI also require special attention.


- <b>SUMMARY</b>


The AMI coping model is a midrange theory
(Walker &amp; Avant, 1995) from which testable
hypotheses regarding AMI coping can be deduced,
and new findings can be used to support
and extend the theory. The AMI coping
model was inductively and deductively derived
from extant empiric and theoretic literature.
The following are key assumptions of
the model: (a) The individual is an active
problem solver who engages in conscious, intentional
cognitive and behavioral effort to
manage specific external or internal demands

Individuals experiencing symptoms of

are clear, time from the onset of acute AMI
symptoms to definitive emergency care is often
protracted, and individuals with a prior
history of AMI or CAD or both are particularly
apt to delay care-seeking. In specifying
emotional response and social reality as key
elements, the AMI model of coping provides
a health care framework for broadening our
understanding of AMI care-seeking behavior.
