BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: So we need, at least for next week —can do 11:40 again.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It's still—at least for the rest of the semester, that's possible. It's a question about next semester.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And just checking in on one other time as a possibility that could be permanent change.
CLIENT: Okay. 
THERAPIST: So at least for Monday.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Let's do 11:40 again, and I'll keep it posted as a permanent thing.
CLIENT: Okay. And is today okay? Is this time okay?
THERAPIST: What do you mean? 
CLIENT: Well, no, I don't know. I just feel like since you have someone right before me, is that weird? Like how do you...
THERAPIST: Ummm...
CLIENT: Oh. That's crazy. 
THERAPIST: Ummm. What does it feel like to you? [00:01:00]
CLIENT: I don't know. I just feel like that must be hard to, like, shift. I mean it's what you do, but it's —
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: You know what I mean? Like you just heard someone else like five—that's hard.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Anyway... (Pause)
THERAPIST: Hmm. 
CLIENT: Umm —
THERAPIST: How could I be here with you I think was the question, really?
CLIENT: But it's just because that's not what I do, so it's hard to understand how you, like, shift, you know, like.
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: Umm, but anyway, yeah, that's—so Monday at 11:40 is fine?
THERAPIST: Yes. Yes.
CLIENT: Cool. Umm, so I saw Kelly last night. Thank you. 
THERAPIST: This warms you.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's kind of... All right. Umm, so here's what I'm trying to do today. I think I'm doing a good job so far, but... Sorry. I mean I really like this girl. I—I really like her. So I'm trying today to not think about it too much, you know?
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Um-hmm. How's that going for ya? Ha-ha.
CLIENT: (Chuckling). Umm, ah, you made a joke; that's good. Umm, it's good. It's hard. Like you know, it's hard, because the more you like someone, or someone like me, the more I like someone, the more I read into things, you know what I mean? I overthink things, you know? [00:02:28]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: So she said something last night that I didn't—I just kind of laughed, but I think that's part of like—there's just something about (pause)—I don't know. Like we're—we're pretty honest with—she's definitely a little more—which I'm not really into that part. She's definitely a little more (pause)—not—not—reserved isn't the right word because she is a president [ph]. She's just—I think she is—I think it is a little harder for her to (pause)—I don't know. Well, but that's not quite right. I don't know. I tend to be—you know, when I'm really, really into somebody, for whatever reason, I don't have a problem expressing that, you know? [00:03:15]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It's not that she has a prob—I can definitely tell—I don't know what she's been through before this or whatever, but, you know, she's—I don't know what I'm saying. I want to say she's being a little more self-protective, but not really. I don't know. But anyway, she's not as articulate, because that's my...
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Like I said, she's like, you know, "I'm sorry, it's kind of hard for me to take compliments." You know, whenever we're just joking around, she's like "I love it." It's like "I don't want you to stop." But she's like "Yeah, it is kind of, you know..."
So we were kind of talking about stuff, and we talked about how—oh, I said something like—I told her, I said, you know, I get the sense that—I was like, you know, I mean nothing's perfect. Obviously people have arguments and disagreements. But it was like I get the sense that we wouldn't bicker. You know, so that I can't stand. That drives me fucking insane, like couples bickering. That's different than having a disagreement and talking it out and having like even an argument maybe. [00:04:21]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But bickering to me is there's something petty and snippy and weird about it; I hate it. Because I'm too tired for all that (chuckling). So, you know, I'm too tired to argue, you know. So in that little thing that you said, that showed me we're kind of about (chuckling) the same page. Like we're just—I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm just like thinking too much but...
THERAPIST: You mean that it felt like that showed you something, but you're going to wonder is it meaning too much out of something, but just don't want it—to comment? 
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: All that's happening here is (chuckling) I really like her. It went super great and another awesome date. But what I'm left with is like, well, but maybe she's going to change her mind, or maybe (pause)—you know, she usually leaves like at a weird hour, like at three, you know, she has to get back, she has to go to work in the morning. And she has her son, you know, so I think she doesn't want to walk in in the morning. You know, it's totally understandable. [00:05:34]
But that's kind of a weird time—it's been totally fine. But like last night I think, again, it's because of the more I like her, the more little things...
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: So like last time it was like, oh, when she left, did she—was she okay? You know what I mean? Like I'm reading into things now because I like her so much, and I don't want to do that, you know. Of course, three in the fucking morning, she's exhausted, she's tired. You know, we had a lot of sex. 
THERAPIST: That's a bad time to leave.
CLIENT: We were kind of napping and, yeah, it's cold, you know. So I don't know. I don't want to—I'm worried that I—I wouldn't want to be—I don't want to go there, where I really like her, and now I'm just like (pause), where all I'm doing is waiting for the next time to see her and be validated that everything's okay. You know, like that's—I wanted us to be able to enjoy it. When I'm not with her, I want to be able to enjoy it. Well, it's awesome. Like I have this cool person I'm hanging out with, you know. And a lot of times I do do that. [00:06:33]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But I guess what I'm saying is that I over like—I'm like, "Oh, should I text her today?" and it will be like, "Hey, hope you got home safe," or, you know, like no, I shouldn't. You know, kind of like...
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: I know some of that's probably very normal. Everyone probably—you know, when you really like someone, it makes you a little more self-aware of stuff, you know, but... (Pause)
THERAPIST: I think you're saying, though, when you start to really feel attached to someone, your anxiety gets higher and higher.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: About her not being mutually attached to you.
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: And so then you get really quite anxious and preoccupied.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: With whether it is or isn't.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it's—and this is always a big caveat, that it's better. Wish [ph] I had the moments when it's like that.
CLIENT: Right. [00:07:36]
THERAPIST: It can take over some of your sense of yourself.
CLIENT: Right, right, exactly.
THERAPIST: It sounds like. So that being you, being yourself out in the world, starts to get a little lost.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because there's so much anxious preoccupation.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which is this kind of attachment disorder.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's anxious attachment. It's not a feeling securely, comfortably, confidently you. And now, enjoying some of the company and falling for somebody and trusting —
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: —who you are. [00:08:11]
CLIENT: (Pause) Yup. (Pause) Yeah. Well, there's also the fear that I—that like seeing how I think about it, I get super-anxious. The fear that if it doesn't work out, that it's going to be some downward spiral, you know, that I'm just going to, you know... (Pause) But it's awful that I would even go that far, you know, to think such, like, negative, you know... It bums me out that I would even go there, you know. (Long pause) [00:09:23]
THERAPIST: I would say you're going there, that is on memory [ph]. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, that's the thing. I mean it has nothing to do with her, you know, or not even just her. It has nothing to do with anything in the present, you know.
THERAPIST: Well, what do you actually think would happen if it didn't work out with her in the present?
CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: What would happen? I don't think you would go into a downward spiral. 
CLIENT: No, yeah. Deep down, I don't think I would either, but... I think it's just what she said or it's just what I feel. It's just like who's tired, you know. Like it would be nice to just—just one fucking thing works out, you know what I mean? Because I think I feel so ready to have like a good relationship that it would just be really sad, like, if yet another—you know what I mean? Like it's just, I don't know. It's getting old. (Pause) So... [00:10:14]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: But in that way I think that's just a normal reaction I think. It doesn't feel that, of course, you want something to work out, and if it doesn't, it really sucks, like. (Pause) 
I think the other thing, maybe the other thing I don't like, is even as it continues to work out, I still—I don't want to feel this way. Let's say we got married. Let's say it's all like... I still—I don't like that feeling. Because what does this mean? Like you could be married to someone for five years and then suddenly they—you know what I mean? That's never going to go away, you know? Someone could just decide they don't love you any more, or whatever the fuck it is, or God, they were even worse, God forbid, you know. So what the fuck? I mean, you know... [00:11:10]
Like I have this like childish notion that it's just the beginning phases, you know, but a test [ph], that doesn't make any sense. It's all—it's not like eventually someone's like, "Okay, now that we've been together one year, I will never, ever leave your side and I'll, you know..." Everybody's, you know... But it doesn't feel like it.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: It's like irrational.
THERAPIST: Hmm. 
CLIENT: (Pause) I don't know. Because more and more, I think what's happening is I think I'm slowly... What did you call this? Is that a thing, anxiety attachment disorder?
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Fuck me. Because now I'm starting to wonder if maybe that's why I don't get shit done. It's not attention deficit disorder; it's that disorder. [00:12:07]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Because if I'm sitting there, and in the back of my mind she's—whatever, whoever's going on, then of course how the fuck can you read a novel or fully engage in work or whatever the fuck, you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Yes. It's not like it'd be a component. I mean it's —
CLIENT: Because it's kind of compulsive. It ends up being a compulsive thing. I can't stop, you know.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Um-hmm. You know, there are the two broad categories, secure attachment and insecure attachment, and even in insecure attachment there's some different varieties, one of which is anxious. And it feels like once you get in and get attached and actually really feel like your heart's in it, that's what you get drawn into, and it feels sort of hard to trust letting the person go, like letting her go for the night. [00:13:05]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Letting her go in your mind. 
CLIENT: Right, right, right.
THERAPIST: Knowing she —
CLIENT: Or also every little moment. I mean that's exhausting. 
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: You can't magnify every little moment. Yeah, there might be a moment where, you know, oh, she didn't kiss me long enough, and she left kind of—did she leave kind of abruptly? Was that kind of a weird... What the fuck? I mean, you know, if you're going to be with someone, not every moment is going to have like a soundtrack in the background and some roman... I mean she—we were together the whole fucking day, she's tired, she's going home. We said bye, we hugged, then a kiss. Like what do we want, you know? That's exhausting. Like that's... And, you know what? It's not fair to the other person. 
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Because it's undermining how much she does care.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: You know what I mean? Like that's not cool. Like she fucking drove all the way—she drives all the way here. We spend the night together. We have a great fucking time every time. You know, it's not fair, like. [00:14:11]
THERAPIST: She gives you a hundred signals that she's into you, and then one that's (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's not like—it's not like we've been on some dates it's like "Oh, damn, we haven't really had sex yet," or yeah, I don't know. It's—it can't be—I don't know what else you're supposed to do. I mean we hang out, we flirt, we say romantic things, we have sex, we say, you know... You know, what is she supposed to do? I mean it's like I hate that, I fucking hate that.
THERAPIST: It's like you're just searching and searching and searching and searching for them whenever she's not going to get [ph] anywhere.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: When is the sign coming.
CLIENT: Right, right, yeah. Like I'm looking for that thread of a sweater that I can just like make it unravel, you know? Yeah. (Pause) So I mean I know it's a ridiculous question, but so—because that's really good to know. Like that's a thing. [00:15:26]
(Chuckling)
CLIENT: It's so funny.
THERAPIST: You like things to hold onto. 
CLIENT: Well, that's kind of huge. That's fucking huge, because I think that's—like I think that's 80 percent of my problem in life, right? I mean it is clear. Like anyone I've been with, I pick the wrong people, and then I've gotten ridiculously like that. (Pause) I mean yeah. I am like now I'll go home and I'll want to read about it and know what are things you can—other than this. I mean what are practical kinds of things you can do to—because it's not going to go away tomorrow, you know. I need a way to—it's like an anxiety attack and you have no way to manage it, you know. (Pause) [00:16:18]
THERAPIST: When you came in today, you were also asking as I brought up a time limit Monday. What did this time work? I just ended with somebody. That sounds like a moment where it happens here, too, where a split second there's some feeling about is it okay to come in? I imagined like a whole range of could I be thinking about you, do I want you in here, to how could I possibly be present with you if someone just left? That like sort of so many anxieties of how it might—actually being here. [00:17:03]
CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. It's not very conscious. Maybe. But I think that's pretty normal. I mean I think a lot of people might wonder is like "Wow, how do you psychologists—I mean how do you do that," you know? I can barely deal listening to one friend's problems and listening to another friend's problems. So how, you know... 
But yeah, maybe. Maybe there's some feeling of—I don't know. 
THERAPIST: Hmm. 
CLIENT: I don't know. 
THERAPIST: What? Maybe even just seeing someone leave my office could downplay, could feel like "Oh, you're just a patient then, or it must (crosstalk)?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. It's probably more of that on a subconscious level. It's like, oh, one leaves, one comes in. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, there's some—it plays on my old feelings of like, you know... At the end of the day, it's like medical/business kind of a thing, you know? But I mean it's not due [ph] to the whole thing.
THERAPIST: I guess what I'm trying to say is those feelings are (inaudible) apparently connected to the attachment and stuff we're talking about, because I think there's a lane, when you get to that place, "Oh, it's just a medical professional." It's like that then there can be no—I don't care. There's no care, there's no... 
CLIENT: Oh, I see what you're saying, yeah. To mix it into a black and white kind of thing, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's an extreme view and it—um-hmm. And it feels like it's—some of that feeling of "Oh, I'm not really lovable after all."
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's probably true. Yup. (Long pause) Yeah. (Long pause) Yeah. It's—I don't know. Yeah, that's something—I think that's—for whatever reason, today I decided like that's—it's just I've got to really figure that. Like that's—I think I'm just—you know how I am, like a switch just goes off all of a sudden. It's like I just can't—it's not working for me anymore. I can't wait until... Because I know what's going to happen. Then I'm going to get a text from her or something, or I'm going to text her, then I'm going to—I'm like "Oh, awesome." Then I'm going to be happy that I heard, you know... [00:19:42]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I don't want it to be like that.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm happy to hear from her, but I don't like to be like—like that hearing from her then alleviates—it's like this back and forth, you know what I mean? Like I—that's exhausting. I don't want to be like that.
THERAPIST: Like the deficit in your self-esteem, and then she would text you and it fills up the hole. [00:20:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But then it leaks out.
CLIENT: Exactly, exactly.
THERAPIST: And then she just—it doesn't really solve the problem.
CLIENT: Exactly, yeah, exactly. (Pause) Yup. 
THERAPIST: You know, it feels like another way of putting this is how hard it is to trust, and it's okay to be yourself in the world.
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: Whether with a woman —
CLIENT: Yeah. Because what happens is like, especially with girls that I really like, and especially now, in the past let's say I was still—there was fogginess and I was putting them on a pedestal and, you know... With this girl, I don't—it's not about putting her on—like I don't think so at least. Like I look at her and, you know, she's a little chunky, you know. She's super-beautiful, but she's not like a stick figure, you know, kind of thing. She has a kid, you know. She lives a little ways out, you know. I just really, really like her, you know? And like—well, what did you say?
THERAPIST: Focusing [ph] on being yourself. [00:21:22]
CLIENT: Oh. So what's happening is like when I'm with her, part of it is just a normal—that's an awesome thing. You know, someone should make you nervous when you're into them. You know, I like that. That's—if I was totally like yeah, whatever, you know, then that's usually when I know I'm not really into somebody, you know. It's when they make you a little—you know, it's butterflies or whatever the fuck, you know. 
But I definitely feel—yeah, it's just what you're saying. I am being myself, but the parts of me that want to tell her how I feel about her or whatever... (Pause) I mean I guess I have been though. I mean I have been good with her. I've been telling her. But then I kind of have to make a joke about it or... Because she's definitely—when I tell her those things, she's—you know, that's when she gets like—she's not—she doesn't immediately say the exact same thing back to me or whatever, you know. And that's—I'm not that—for whatever reason, that part I'm not reading into it. I just feel like that's kind of courtship in a way. Like I think she's feeling me out, because at the first date she said, you know—I think she even asked me. She's like "Are you sure you're not bullshitting me or something?" she's probably, you know... I think she's being wise, you know. She's like "Yeah, whatever. Like I'm sleeping with you and I'm into you, but now you're just saying this shit to..." You know what I mean? [00:22:53]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, um-hmm.
CLIENT: So I—but I know. I know that she's really into it. She's just... But you're right. Like it's hard for me... (Pause) I even told her last night. Like she was just kind of like—she was laughing because like some of my talk—and I do this with everybody, but with her we were talking, and I kept kind of stopping myself and being like, hmm. Like I was like (chuckling)... And I told her. I was like, you know, "I'm kind of sorry." I was like "I'm kind of editing things," and she just kind of laughed and... So that's, you know... [00:23:26]
THERAPIST: That's different. 
CLIENT: But part of it is—part of it is I'm being self-protective, because otherwise I think I would just compliment her nonstop. I mean I just—you know, I'm like that. When I really like somebody, I like expressing that, you know.
But part of it, too, is yeah, that I felt kind of shy or, you know, to just be myself completely, you know. I don't know, something. But at the same time, it's weird, because it is so different. 
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I mean we had a good—and I wasn't thinking—while I'm with her I don't think about stuff really, so it's good. But it's like you said, the problem is then when she's not there, or if we're not texting or whatever, that's when these other, you know... (Pause) I don't know if that makes sense. But basically I'm just saying you're right like that. [00:24:27]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, there's something about I am being myself, but on some level there's some moves [ph] or it's based on a contingent—it's —
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:24:40).
CLIENT: Yeah. Like it's—it's conditional, kind of like. I'll be myself, but as long as I know that—you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: So while I'm with her, of course I'm being myself; she's right there, you know. And I see her eyes and I see that she's into it when we kiss or we flirt and we talk and it's awesome; that's great. But the minute that she's not, I can't just enjoy that and go like "Oh, it's so cool. I'll see her again" and whatever. [00:25:11]
THERAPIST: So maybe it has more of the feeling of these days are just very different than before. You are being more yourself in the moment.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you can't hold onto, when you leave, that being yourself is okay.
CLIENT: Exactly. Exactly.
THERAPIST: You know, just to trust then that that was good to have been yourself.
CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. Because then when I'm with myself, then that's an old feeling, right? That it's just me in my head.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So then those other voices are much—they get in, much easier, because "Oh, now you're alone again." 
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "And she's off—who knows what she's doing. She's off doing her own thing," and, you know, but... Just, ah, it's so irrational and it's so rational, Jesus.
THERAPIST: Well, you're back to this very old self state.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The second you're lonely. There's so much time alone.
CLIENT: Yeah. And when I'm alone, the rational stuff, again, it doesn't work. 
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But in my mind from here, but if I total [ph] those voices like —
THERAPIST: Yeah, no, it's not about rationalizing.
CLIENT: Yeah. There's no rational—if I'm like no, she told her friend about me. She wants to do the artwork for my CD. Her friend and her want to make a video forum. That's not someone that's just like feeling you out or something, you know? But it doesn't—it doesn't matter, you know. That's what—that's what I'm saying. That's a true bummer. Like, you know, instead of wow, that's so—cover aid [ph], you know, we'll see what happens, and right now it's really good, and, you know... In the moment, I can do that, but... (Pause) [00:26:43]
THERAPIST: I keep thinking right now, you know, having pretty recently told me about a number of different experiences that—so many which revolved around how lonely you were as a child, such as sitting [ph] on your beige carpet.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: By yourself, on your stomach, lying there, latchkey kid, and, you know, watching whatever you wanted on television, but just by yourself, no one around. What must have already been going on in your mind as a little boy, brewing about "Why am I so alone? Where is everybody?" You told me once even earlier than that about a memory of—just some flashbulb of, in time, having been in—and I think it was D.C. with your dad. He'd go to the garage with his buddies and hang out. And you were straining to describe this as a happy memory, but then like I kept sort of asking, sort of poking into the memory. Like what did you actually do there? Were there kids there? [00:27:47]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you said you were by yourself and that there were the men talking with—or saying that they were playing ball with you or...
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: You're by yourself again. It's really quite a sad memory. There's so much you by yourself, alone with your thoughts, alone with your fantasies of why no one's around. Kids do a lot in their minds with what—like why aren't the adults here? [00:28:12]
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: And there are a lot of rational reasons for it, but you don't know that as a kid.
CLIENT: Um-hmm. Yeah. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Even though it was a memory of you in L.A., you were talking about something you heard [ph] and described in such detail before of being the last months and pay rent.
CLIENT: Umm.
THERAPIST: It's dirty and, you know, I need more money, and a landlord comes chasing after you. So it's this persecuted—alone. It's terribly sad, this place in your mind.
CLIENT: (Long pause)
THERAPIST: Nostradamus, you know, embodiments, and then concrete fantasy.
CLIENT: The what? [00:29:11]
THERAPIST: The embodiment. I was just sort of —
CLIENT: No, but what was the first thing you said?
THERAPIST: Nostradamus. Didn't you say that was your—no? Is that not... Who was it that was in your nightmares? It wasn't even a nightmare; it was a fantasy.
CLIENT: Oh, Nosferatu.
THERAPIST: Ah.
CLIENT: Nostradamus?
THERAPIST: (Chuckling)
CLIENT: That's like... Yeah, Nosferatu.
THERAPIST: Yeah, Nosferatu. The idea of this getting so concrete in your mind, about the inner anxieties that you are haunted with. 
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: And the only thing that would soothe [ph] that is your mother coming in, the sort of actual physical presence. But now we're alone for a very long time. [00:30:02] 
CLIENT: (Long pause) Well, I don't know. 
THERAPIST: Why you shake your head?
CLIENT: Well, it's just like overwhelming. You know, like—it's like I don't know—you don't know what to do with all that. It's like when I really think about it, I'm just like a—I'm just like speechless and I don't know what to do with it, you know what I mean? 
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: It just kind of gives me a headache.
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: Because I don't know how to write about it. I don't know how to—like it's just so overwhelming. I don't know what to make of it, you know?
THERAPIST: Hmm. 
CLIENT: (Long pause) I think unfortunately what happened is when I really think about it, well, then, by default, that's how I feel, do you know what I mean? [00:31:23]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: I start feeling that way. It's like "Oh, shit, I do feel all alone," you know what I mean? So that's just—it sucks.
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: (Pause) Or not so much that I feel that way now. It's just I started really remembering those feelings, you know? (Long pause)
THERAPIST: See, I think that remembering those is going to help, even though it makes it feel worse. Because in some ways you could say what you are fearing with her, with whomever it is, and what you were fearing might come true, is actually a fear of something that's already happened. [00:32:24]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's not actually about the future.
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: This relationship might work out and it might not, but it's not because of the things inside you that you're afraid of. You know, it's going to run its course, you're going to get to know each other in the reality; that like that's how it would go.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it's not because of one thing you say or do.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Or one thing she says or does that it's going to blow up. It's just—that's not the reality. But the fear inside is what's already happened to you.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: The abandonment as a child. [00:33:00]
CLIENT: (Long pause)
THERAPIST: I mean I think when you say in here "It just makes me like, fuck, I am alone," in a way you are hitting up against the memory of what your childhood was. You were terribly lonely.
CLIENT: (Long pause) (Sighing sound) (Pause) Yeah, it's a tough one. (Pause) You know, and I think what's hard about it is like it's hard to talk about these things even with someone you care about. [00:34:47]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That is for me, it's hard. You know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Sure it is.
CLIENT: It's—it's—it explains a lot. Or it's like, you know, it sounds like it explains a lot. It's like—I don't know. It's like I want someone that I really care about to know those things. [00:35:07] 
THERAPIST: Umm.
CLIENT: But...
THERAPIST: But...
CLIENT: Well, but I don't know why. I mean, what? See, I want them to know why. So they're going to give me extra love or something, you know what I mean? It just is what it is. A lot of people have had shitty childhoods or whatever. 
But I guess what I'm saying is that part of me is so shut off from my friends, from, you know... And I think that's hard, you know, when people—you're not—and I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that. But I think that—I wonder if that's got to play a role. It's like if you're just carrying it around but no one knows anything about that... (Pause) And I mean it's like someone saying "Well, I was raped when I..." What, they're supposed to tell their—all their friends at some point that they were raped? I mean... [00:36:05]
THERAPIST: No. 
CLIENT: It is what it is. I mean people have shitty experiences when they're kids or children. But maybe because my specific experience was being alone, by default it's like I want to not be alone by telling people about it, you know what I mean? Like...
THERAPIST: Every person, no matter what their psychic trauma as a child, has unconscious and sometimes conscious tasks of finding a scenario in the future that will play it out and have it happen differently. The hope of a repair and the hope of—in other words, you say the wish to tell someone. 
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: And have them know and give extra —
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Like almost that that could compensate for the damage done.
CLIENT: Right, right. [00:37:07]
THERAPIST: It's such a normal mesh, you know? It's like, in a way, the person who's—sexually there's a child, marries somebody who is raped some, or physically abused —
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: —by somebody who is a batterer, there's a wish this time it will come out differently. "I'm going to find someone who's similar enough" so that they'd open up their own fantasy, and again it's repeated because you can't undo the past. 
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: So much more of it I think is mourning.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: And a lot of people spend a lot of time refusing to mourn and, you know, what's their hope? Holding on a certain grandiose fantasy, you know, it's like something in their children, and "They're going to be the thing that I never got to have." It's all about fantasies of things in terms of denying the reality there ever was, and that putting it into perspective inside. [00:38:16]
CLIENT: (Pause) I think I'm doing okay with the mourning, I think, overall. I definitely don't—(pause) nah. [00:38:34] 
THERAPIST: I think when this anxiety gets kicked up with Kelly, for example, it's a moment where you've been pulled into some—some sense that there's something old happening that you really want to make sure doesn't happen, like you could stop it now. It's not the mourning place that that happened already, and I can't—there's a name [ph]. This is different. This is a relationship in the present that has very little to do with that. [00:39:08]
CLIENT: (Pause) (Sighing sound) (Long pause) I just realized something. I wonder if that's why deep down sometimes I still want to—it bothers me that I can't find like an Assyrian girl that's kind of like...
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: That suddenly makes perfect—I mean, sure, some of it is that—you know, it is, you know, I mean some of it is just—it's important. You know, like I want to be able to speak Assyrian, and that would be nice, you know? But now I'm realizing that I bet you some of it is because that would make me feel like home, you know, like it would somehow compensate, you know? (Pause) [00:41:07]
THERAPIST: Right, and I know this is making it really kind of conscious and explicit and it probably doesn't take quite the performance [ph], but it's like saying "Can I find my mother and father" in this person.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like yeah. It's like can I find like this cozy, you know, home kind of feeling, you know, yeah.
THERAPIST: To pass it onto you. 
CLIENT: Yeah. But yeah, see, now it's—fuck, that makes perfect... That's why with like non-Assyrian girls, there's always been that moment I'm like "Oh, this feels weird," their family or their—you know what I mean? I think I've said it in here. Like I go to their house and that's weird. Yeah, it's weird because I'm—it's not my house, or it's not my grandparents' house, or it's not like this, you know... No shit, it's somebody else's house, you know. That makes perfect sense now. (Pause) It's like when you're brought up in such a bubble, somebody else's level is completely alien, like unsettling, you know. [00:42:14]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: Especially the more they tell you that they care about you.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Umm.
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: You know, but really generally [ph] even if it's not a culture, like a clear cultural bubble, that still happens to people outside of their own family, you know? Like people find and say if [ph] like another, and so much of the time what they're finding is something that's adopted or on second leads from the past.
CLIENT: Oh, right. 
THERAPIST: That inevitably, 15 years into the marriage, start to get disappointed, because you realize "Wait, I didn't marry my parents," or "I didn't marry some undoing of my parents.
CLIENT: Right. [00:43:05]
THERAPIST: You married a real whole person who's from their own life and has their own mind. You know, that—I think relationships are replete with that kind of trying to reach out and find another whole person when there's so much shock still inside.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: This is a process that is part of the freeing up people from doing that as much. But I think that's inherent in people finding another person in life.
CLIENT: Um-hmm. (Pause)
THERAPIST: Like the fantasy of finding your mirror.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It doesn't actually exist.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's what you needed as a baby, a mirror in your parents. Your parents were totally preoccupied with sending you back to you. I see you make this gesture. I see you smile, so I smile. You know, that dyadic interaction that helps you form a sense of self as a baby that you needed and didn't get. It's my guess, even though, you know, we haven't heard a lot about the toddler years. [00:44:17] 
And so you could even find somebody who is that person for a while in fantasy, and actually you'd find they're not.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Because they're not.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, they're their own separate person, and they'll be disappointing one day.
CLIENT: Um-hmm. (Pause)
THERAPIST: What?
CLIENT: What? Oh, I'm just thinking. Or not even thinking actually. It makes sense. That's why I like—it's like, "Oh, she has toes," you know what I mean? 
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: It's like yeah, no shit she has toes. Like, you know—like that's why I focus on these very human—like you know what I mean? Like yeah, that's a —
THERAPIST: That's a great example. [00:45:27]
CLIENT: Yeah. Like those are separate—she has a body. She—that's a person, you know.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. 
CLIENT: (Pause)
THERAPIST: Tomorrow [ph].
CLIENT: Go—3 10? Cool. Thanks, I'll see you later. [00:46:06]
