Well, I was quite surprised about four o'clock Saturday the
ninth, just three hours after I sent the letter to Dr. Kempf. As
I was writing in the dining space of Ward 4-C-2, a guard came
to the gate and called my name. Thach, come along. You are
being transferred."


I gathered up the papers on the table, and folded them.
"Where to, this time?" I asked, approaching the gate.


"You're going down to Ward 4-A-2."

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, that's good. I've been there before, and it will be good
to get back" As I had all my belongings in my pocket and the
guard had my file folder, it was a simple process. I was just
escorted down the hall to the opposite end of the building.
When I entered the ward the nurse on duty recognized me
and seemed glad to see me. She said, "Why, Thach, I thought
you had gone home by this time. Do you want your old job
back?"


I had had the job of making the beds in the east wing before
leaving. "I sure do. It will give me a chance to do some more
writing that the doc says is so bad for me," I said, smiling. She
called a corpsman and had him arrange for me to have my
same bed back. He also located my shoes and belt and gave them
to me.


After the evening meal—which I ate with Nate, my Jewish
friend—we were allowed to go out in the yard. Nate was looking
much better and had gained quite a bit of weight We talked
about the work on the farm, and he assured me that things
were going well with him. "Thach," Nate began, as we left the
group at the door leading into the yard, "where have you been?"


"In a sense, Nate, I've traveled through hell, but I sure have
learned a greal deal." I pointed over to Building Three, as I
continued. "You see that building? Well, up there on the third
floor is Ward 3-C-2, the violent ward; and I spent five days
there."


"What in the hell were you doing up there?"


"Well, the only thing I can figure out is that Doctor Bricker
wanted to break me down before my wife left. But I wouldn't
oblige him. So he transferred me to Ward 4-C-2, where the longtermers
are—such as that guy over there." As I said this I pointed
to the "preacher" we had noticed several times before.


"By the way, has your wife gone home yet?"


"Yes, she left a couple of days ago. I sent all my writing
home with her. Someday I may tell the world about this
experience."


"You mean you are still writing?" asked Nate, a little
concerned.

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Sure, Nate. You know I firmly believe that if I did not write
down what I am thinking—talk to myself, so to speak—I would
surely have cracked up by now. You see, that's what they say is
wrong with me. I contend that I'm here for a purpose, and that
purpose is to write about the patient's viewpoint. Have you
talked with your doctor lately?"


"Some, but not much. I don't know what he wants me to
say. Every time I see him he just asks me if I want to talk yet?"


"Don't you see what he wants you to talk about? I think he
wants you to tell him in your own words what happened. Have
you ever tried to write what you think happened the day before
you were put in the hospital?"


"No, I haven't and I don't know if I could."


"Look, Nate, I've found it helps me a lot when I think back
honestly about my thoughts and actions. Then when I put them
down on paper it really helps me to go on from there, without
worrying so much about what others may think about me. How
about writing tonight just what you remember happening during
the two or three days before you had to go to the hospital?"


Nate looked at me, and I felt a real bond of friendship as he
said, "For you I'll try."


I put my arm across his shoulders (he is at least six inches
shorter than I am) as we walked toward the gate. "Good. I'm
sure that if you do your best to remember, you'll be able to get
it down so that you can see what the doctor is trying to get you
to see." We went back to the ward together. Nate asked for some
paper at the nurse's office before going to his bed in the west
wing.


As I work in the east wing and Nate works on the farm, the
only times we see each other is at mealtime or in the yard after
supper on fair days. The next day at lunch, Nate handed me two
sheets of paper, on which was the following (used by permission):
<blockquote>
<p>
On May 7th, I arrived on North Island attached to the U. S. Naval
Air Station at San Diego. I felt confident of myself and had at last
controlled my tenseness, anxiety and nervousness. For the first time

in my Navy career I was enjoying peace of mind. I was assigned to my
quarters and was later assigned to work in the mess hall serving out
the chow. I did my work willingly and enjoyed this peace of mind for
several days.

On May 7th, I arrived on North Island attached to the U. S. Naval
Air Station at San Diego. I felt confident of myself and had at last
controlled my tenseness, anxiety and nervousness. For the first time

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day while serving out the butter I was told by the chief in
charge of the mess hall to limit the men to one piece of butter and
one piece of bread. Prior to that, not knowing of this limitation, I had
permitted them to have two or more pieces of bread if they cared for
them. I carried out the orders for a while; but after I had gotten into
several disputes over this, I took it upon myself to let some of them
have two slices. I became nervous and my fear of being punished
increased. I became uneasy and began to lose my confidence and lost
my grip on myself. My head began to pain me at the temples, and
continuous mental activity seized me as it had once before. This went
on several days, with my head hurting worse than ever. I sweated
quite profusely now, and I became weaker. I couldn't shake off this
continual mental activity which gradually developed into self-persecution.
I knew I was going to crack up if I did not check this in time.
My nervousness increased beyond my control, and I was startled at the
slightest noise. My nerves were straining and my head hurt quite a bit
now. I sweated more than ever.


My friends had seen the state I was in and tried their best to get
me to snap out of this trance. I knew that if I could stop work for a
while I would be able to snap out of it; but I was afraid to go to the
sick bay for fear of having to tell what had happened—which I felt
would lead to my being discharged. For two weeks I was in this condition,
my head hurting at the temples and at the back very much.
My eyes were glassy and fixed. I couldn't shake off this condition, for
I had already lost control of myself. I could not coordinate my actions
with my mind. I was still aware of all that was happening, but my
memory and power to speak were failing rapidly.


On May 20th I received many letters, among which were letters
from my brother, cousin, and brother-in-law, which did not make
sensible reading, and which provoked my condition further. The card
from my cousin in particular led me to believe that I had been disowned.
In the first paragraph she asked me how I enjoyed the package
my mom had sent me. I had received the package several days before,
but because of my condition I had been unable to write. The second
paragraph said that I had nothing to worry about as she had told the

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All this time I didn't get any letters from home, and this furthered
my belief that I had caused my mother to become sick with worry
over not hearing from me.


The next night, Saturday, May 27th, I decided to call home by
phone and find out if this was true. We did not have a phone at home;
so I made the call to the grocery store right next to my home. The
woman who answered kept asking me who I was. I told her my name
and who I wanted to speak to at least a dozen times. My already
shocked mind misinterpreted her voice to the point where it sounded
to me as though she didn't want to know me any more. This confirmed
my suspicions, and I was further convinced that my mother had died
and that my father and sister had moved. I thought now I would be
shot for what I had done. In terror and fear I left the telephone exchange
and went to the crews' park, convinced that I would be shot
soon. I began to review my past life.


I had been the cause of much curiosity now, and I heard a crowd
collect outside of the park. Presently a Wave came over to me and
gave me a pack of cigarettes. I spoke with her for a while and told
her that I would come out soon—to be shot, I thought She left after
a while and I sat there in terror and fear. When taps blew the crowd
had already dispersed. Presently the Officer of the Day came to me
with two Marines, who took me to the administration building in their
car. I was questioned by the officer there and then taken to the sick
bay for the night. In the morning a doctor came in to speak with me
and asked, "Well, what are the voices saying?" "They stopped," I
answered. "What's troubling you?" he asked. Then I began to review
my past to him. "So what?" he said. "You can stay here a few days."


I realized that he was suggesting that I rest up for a few days
before going back to duty. But what had occurred that night before
had so impressed itself upon my shocked mind that even to think
about it caused my head to pain again; and the thought of going back
to duty at the same place after all that had happened made me afraid
more than ever, and I didn't answer him. "Well, I know what you
need," he said as he left.


I was then told to get dressed. After I had put on my whites I
began to walk out of the sick bay, not knowing where I was to go,

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hi, Nate! Come on, let's walk down to the far end where we
can talk. How did the work on the farm go today?" I asked, as
we began to walk diagonally toward the far corner of the large
playground.


"Oh, I got along all right But I've been doing a lot of thinking,"
Nate answered, a little hesitantly.


"Well, that's good—as long as you don't try to understand
everything all at once. You know, I like what you wrote last
night I think it shows real courage on your part"


"But I'll never be able to go back there and face my friends—"


"That's one thing both of us have to stop worrying about
We might as well make up our minds that we're out of the Navy
for good. The thing we must see is that the type of thing that
happened to you can happen again. The way to keep it from
happening again is to understand what caused it to happen in
the first place. That's where the doctor comes in. He can take
what you have written and help you if you will trust him," I
said, as we came to the fence. I took out my pack of cigarettes
and offered him one.


Nate looked at me in a concerned manner, and asked, "How
in the hell can you uphold the doctors after the way they have
treated you?"

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh, Nate, you can't judge all doctors by just one or two. I
just happened to get involved with some that think they know
it all. Most of the doctors are honest, sincere men who will do
the very best they can for us."


"Oh, yeah? But what can they do, even if they wanted to help
us?"


"Well, in your case I think he can help you accept the fact
that your trouble was just as real as any other kind of sickness.
You see, Nate, yours was a kind of nervous disorder that disrupted
your whole system. When the nervous system is out of
whack our minds are affected. The doctors know about these
things, and they help us by encouraging us to accept the fact
that we have been victims of a disease, but that we can recover
completely."


"Well, I still don't see why you are here after all that you
have written. The doctors have read your stuff, haven't they?"


"You know, Nate, I think that's the trouble, in my case.
They've had a chance to read it, but I don't think any doctor has
ever read it all. The first doctor read what I thought about myself
before ever going to the preacher in New Orleans. And boy, was
I sick at that time! He wrote a letter to the next doctor, Doctor
Combs, at Lakeview Hospital, and I was judged from the letter
and not from anything that I had written. That letter is what
Doctor Bricker read the first day I came here, and he made up
his mind right then about my sickness."


"Well, why don't they explain to you what they think is
wrong?"


"Nate, they've seen so many men affected by religious
experience who became crackpots that they have learned to
disregard any person who claims he has a divine mission. You
see, ideas are powerful, and they can cause us to do things that
are both good and bad. We judge a thing or an idea good or
bad by what we have been taught, or by our own personal
experience in life. The idea of the great God of this universe
choosing a sick, ignorant sailor like me to send to help the
mighty medical profession of our day is foolish in the eyes of

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nate looked up at me, "You know, Thach, that's what worries
me about you. You say God sent you, but God is truth—"


"Yes, many people think of God as a cosmic power that we
see operating through principles, and they judge right principles
by the effect they have on their way of life. Then God to them
becomes truth. But God is more than the power of one group's
set of principles. The reason why doctors do not let us have
Bibles here is that the ideas and principles set forth in the Bible
have great power over the mind of men."


"What about the Law? We believe that the Law must be
man's guide to a religious life. If the Law is kept, we will be
wealthy and prosper. This has been proved true in the history
of my people."


"Why, sure, it is true to you because you have heard it all
your life. Every person that you have been taught to look up
to has been educated in the Law, and his mission has been to
interpret the meaning and truth of the Law. But let me ask you
a question: How did the Law come to be?"


"The Law came by Moses."


"Well, I realize that I do not know enough about this question
to argue it with you. But somehow I feel that a new day must
dawn in the history of mankind, if the peoples of the world are to
learn to live by the intentions of God. Living by the letter of
the Law is not the answer. Freedom—being free to love, being
free to follow the law of love, being free to disregard what has
been laid down by men as the right way of life—is the answer.
Man is not free today to venture out and follow the dictates
of his conscious thoughts. They would lock up Moses so quickly
in this day that it would make your head swim. And Jesus—why,
if he came claiming that he was sent from the Father, they
wouldn't put him on a cross, they would just ignore him until
he began to be a threat to the basic premises on which our
happiness and security rest today."

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Thach, don't get yourself all worked up," said Nate. He had
detected a growing bitterness in my voice. "I realize I've never
been very religious; in fact, I've never really seen much good
it did my religious friends."


"That's what causes me much concern—these so-called religious
folk. You take that preacher that preached to us last Sunday
in the auditorium—did you go to the service?"


"No," Nate said, smiling, "I don't think I'm ready to become
a Christian."


"Well, I guess the thing that I'm getting at is in your religion
also. Sometimes I get the idea that a lot of people think God
died after He gave Moses the Law. Now this preacher gives me
the idea that the important thing is to believe that Jesus is alive
and will walk and talk with anyone who will let Him do it I
wonder what he would do if I went up to him and told him about
my experience! You know, Nate, I'm beginning to see what
causes so many people to become confused after they have a
religious experience." I noticed that the patients were moving
toward the entrances into the building, and said, "Let's move
toward the building. It's about time to go in. I'm getting myself
all mixed up talking about something that is new to me; but
I'm going to think about these things some more later."


Nate appeared thoughtful as we walked across the yard.
"Thach, I think I'll go in to see my doctor in the morning," he
said.


"That's a good idea. Show him what you wrote, and ask
him to help you keep it from happening again. He'll do it."


After getting back to the ward I went to my bed in the far
end of the east wing. As I took off my clothes and lay down,
many thoughts were racing through my mind. I felt anxious,
and thought that what I was thinking was very important After
about five minutes of this mental activity, I began to realize
that I was letting myself get out of control. I thought: This is
how it happens. My thoughts get jumbled, and if I let the condition
keep building up I'll surely lose my mind." The words
of the preacher in New Orleans came back to me: "Get a grip

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just as soon as I changed my thinking, the pain disappeared.
To me it was clear that the one thing I could not do was doubt
myself. I knew I did not understand the meaning of all that was
happening, but I was convinced that God knew and that I would
know later on. When I accepted this Iine of thinking I felt greatly
relieved, and my whole body relaxed. I closed my eyes and
breathed a prayer of thanks; "O Lord, forgive me for trying to
hurry things."
