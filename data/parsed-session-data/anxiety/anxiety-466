BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So you hurt your rib on the tennis cart?
<b>PT:</b> I did, bad, I couldn't even get up, on Sunday it was really really bad.  It's just annoying now.  It's more annoying than anything but it's still painful but it's right up in here which is weird.  I don't know how that happened.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like it was a pretty heavy fall.
<b>PT:</b> It was.  I've gotten heavier so the fall was heavier.
<b>DR:</b> Oh no.
<b>PT:</b> I've gotten heavier. 
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Since when?
<b>PT:</b> I've gained about 10 pounds.  Well two summers ago I was 145, I'm 150 again or 155.
<b>DR:</b> You've been 155 before, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was before I lost, I was 160 when I lost, went down to 135.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then something happened and I started eating again and haven't been able to talk myself into it.  This morning I looked in the mirror and [INAUDIBLE], so I may be able to motivate myself somewhat.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> In getting back in shape.
<b>DR:</b> It's good to be out on the tennis court, that helps.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  On Sunday when I fell, I tried to play again and I couldn't, it hurt so bad, it hurt really bad trying to go this way and that way.  It was terrible but let's see what else is new and exciting, I'm a great aunt.
<b>DR:</b> Congratulations.
<b>PT:</b> My sister's daughter had a baby.  I went up a couple of times to see her.
<b>DR:</b> Where?
<b>PT:</b> She lives in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And let's see what else, I feel like I'm falling apart but I'm really worried about my [INAUDIBLE], I really really worried about it.
<b>DR:</b> When does it come up?
<b>PT:</b> February.
<b>DR:</b> February of this year.
<b>PT:</b> This year, yeah, because I really need to get a grip on myself and get things together.  I just can't, I can't get rid of things in my house.  I have a hard time getting rid of stuff.  I have a hard hard time.  When you don't use it, you know, the old one, two, three, if you don't [INAUDIBLE], if you haven't used it in two years, I just have a hard time.  I have a hard hard time, letting go of people and letting go of things in my house.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so the connection with retirement is just letting go of work.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, well, no I have to work.  I can't survive without working.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Retirement from your job just means -
<b>PT:</b> Getting another job.
<b>DR:</b> Transition to something.
<b>PT:</b> And starting all over again.  Not really starting all over again because it's not, I need the money, I definitely need the money.
<b>DR:</b> You have a career with experience.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Starting without any experience.  What kind of jobs would you be looking at?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't really know. I don't know if I want to go back to clerical.  I mean I can, I can always go back into it but I was thinking about maybe learning how to, between now and February, learning how to train dogs.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> There's a school in [DEIDENTIFIED] but I can't, I've been looking, that's why I've been cleaning my paperwork out, looking for the paperwork for that, for that particular thing and I haven't been able to find it yet.  So I did get rid of a lot of paperwork but there's just, I never complete a damn thing, I never finish anything.  If I succeed in retiring, which I hope I'll retire in February, it will be a completion.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you complete jobs at work all the time. 
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, I do that but in my personal life, I don't complete a dang thing.
<b>DR:</b> Well retirement is going to be something that you don't have, I mean the structure of your job will help you with retirement.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You set the date, they're going to feed you the paperwork you need to complete and they're, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That'll all be set.  I guess what you're saying is that you have different ideas of what you'd like to do but it's hard to follow through unless somebody else structures it for you.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  I am not a structured person.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard for you to reach that goal. 
<b>PT:</b> I'm better off working because I'm structured.
<b>DR:</b> Structured environment.
<b>PT:</b> Structured.
<b>DR:</b> I mean I guess you could, you know, if your goal is to train dogs, you could put down, like look at a calendar and put down the steps and the time frame and try to set some goals for yourself but the only person you're accountable to is yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You're not accountable to anybody else when you do that.
<b>PT:</b> Well, you're accountable to the person that you have to go train their dog.
<b>DR:</b> Right but to get trained as a dog trainer.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, oh, oh, you're right.
<b>DR:</b> Once you've been trained in that job, yeah, then you can look at it that you have responsibilities to the dog, to the owner.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And whatever company you're working for, you may have to meet certain quotas or whatever, so you get that structure, it sets the goal, but to actually get trained, nobody else is going to set the goal for you except for you,  right?  I mean I guess when you're training they'll be, the school has goals that they'll set for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so my first goal is to find the paperwork because I don't remember the name of the school.  I could look on, I think I'll put dog training schools in the computer, I can do it that way.  I never thought, I didn't sleep all night.  I didn't sleep the entire night.
<b>DR:</b> The entire night?
<b>PT:</b> I was up all night.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know why.
<b>DR:</b> Where you nervous about coming here?
<b>PT:</b> Well yeah I was, I didn't want to miss it.
<b>DR:</b> You called yesterday, I know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I thought it was today.
<b>DR:</b> Well you have a good internal sense.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  My internal sense, if I listen to them sometimes I would be much better off.
<b>DR:</b> You'll have to figure out a way to take the card when you leave and write it in big letter on your calendar.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so, I don't know, I think I might have just worried about retiring.  I'm still worried about getting fired.  That is still a thing in my head.
<b>DR:</b> You know, between now and February is not a long time.  I think you're going to be reaching February.  
<b>PT:</b> I still worry.  I mean I know it's irrational and unrealistic and I just think that they're going to try to get me on something, no matter what it is that they can find and that they're going to try to find something, you know, I just.
<b>DR:</b> Well you're still able to do your job every day.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not avoiding going to work.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Doing strange things to your bosses or anything like that.
<b>PT:</b> No, I try not to.
<b>DR:</b> Biting your tongue.
<b>PT:</b> I did throw a bottle but not, it was into the trash can, I didn't throw it at her, I threw it into the trash can but she was saying in front of me, right beside me, her and the human resources manager were saying things like, yeah we can get rid of those non reps whenever we want to.  Well I'm a non rep so they fed into my fear, you know, they fed into my fear so when she walked and went into the conference room, I just got so mad.  Hello, yeah, hi how are you doing?  Yeah I left her a message, I'm bringing them today.  Okay, no problem.  I'll take them back home because I have them with me.  I left a message on her phone, her phone at work.  I didn't have it on me, I have it at work.  All right.  All right, I'll take them back home.  I'm at the doctor's appointment this morning, then I'm coming in.  Well I have to down, I have to take him back home and then I'm coming in, then I have to go to, I might have to go to, my doctor couldn't see me yesterday, I called and he told me to call back tonight to see if there are any cancelations, he didn't have any, so I have to call him at ten o'clock, my other doctor, for my rib, he thinks I might have chipped it but all right, I'll bring them home again.  All right.  All right.  Did she say when she's going to be, I'm coming in but did she say when.  All right.  All right, no problem.  All right, bye.  That was my boss.  
<b>DR:</b> What time are you supposed to be in work?
<b>PT:</b> No, it wasn't that.  I had to bring a cat in for this woman who's the managing director and I had to bring [INAUDIBLE] a kitten.  I was supposed to bring them yesterday.  I have them with me in the car.  She said don't bring them today because today's a bad day for her.  She can't go home.  I guess she don't want to leave them at work screaming so now I have to take them back home.
<b>DR:</b> Whose kitten is it?
<b>PT:</b> It was from my neighbors.  I have another one, you want a kitten?  Do you know anybody who wants a cat, a white cat, he was abused.  He loves people, he likes his owner but he don't like dogs and I've got him.  I mean he likes dogs, he hates cats.  He wants to be the only -
<b>DR:</b> The only cat.
<b>PT:</b> The main cat.  I tried a million times to incorporate him with my cats, he attacks them.  He's fine with [NAME OTHER], rubs against [NAME OTHER].  [NAME OTHER] is like his best friend, you know, but he hates cats.  He's all white, he's all white and has pink eyes.  I have to get rid of him.  It's racking my soul that I have to get rid of him because I can't keep.  Someone gave him to me because they were being thrown, he was going to be thrown out again.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So I took, I don't know why I do this because, you know, sometimes it's not wise to be kind, sometimes it's cruel to be kind and now I have to deal with.
<b>DR:</b> Cruel to you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah because it sounds like you take care of the cats pretty well. 
<b>PT:</b> Well I'm trying.
<b>DR:</b> You care about them but then -
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying to.  I'm even going to get him fixed before I give him to the [DEIDENTIFIED] so it's one thing that people won't have to do and maybe they'll think of him twice, you know.  I don't wan t to do that because it's 60 bucks but I'm going to do it just so he has a chance, you know, so sometimes it's cruel to be kind but anyway, so anyway I worry about her, you know, you know, because she, that's why I threw the bottle because.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] were they talking about other -
<b>PT:</b> I have no idea.  There are only two non reps, me and another lady.  She's leaving.  She was already leaving.
<b>DR:</b> And non-rep means?
<b>PT:</b> Non-rep means no union.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you're non-union.
<b>PT:</b> Haven't been for the last ten years.
<b>DR:</b> Are the other people union.
<b>PT:</b> Ninety five percent of them.
<b>DR:</b> Is your boss union?
<b>PT:</b> No, she's non-rep.  She deputy director that puts her in a level way way above mine even but, yeah, so it really angered me so I threw the soda bottle into the trash can and then it popped out I threw it so hard but you can't do that.
<b>DR:</b> But nobody else was around, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know if [NAME OTHER] saw me, you know, because she said, she faces me down the other end but I tried, I don't think she could see.  She might have saw the soda bottle come out of the can because it popped out but I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Well.
<b>DR:</b> I mean it still sounds like you have -
<b>PT:</b> And I worry that they have cameras around, like I know that's paranoid but, and I worry that they're bugging my phone.  Then there was a robbery at my house, did I tell you about that.
<b>DR:</b> No, no.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  [INAUDIBLE] there was a guy, I went up the [DEIDENTIFIED], did you know that it's an AA place, [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED], I needed help in the house and usually when I need cheap labor or reasonable labor I go there because they're always willing to take, within reason, they won't take nothing but they'll -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> And so I went there and I asked for someone who could help me so they recommended this guy [NAME OTHER].  
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], yeah, so he came and, I don't think he came that first day, I think he called me and said that he had heard that I needed somebody or whatever.  So then the day he came to help me, he went everywhere with me.  We went down to [DEIDENTIFIED], you know, he said he didn't have nothing to do so it was no big deal.  He did some work in the house, which I needed.  He did the work I needed done and I paid him and he went his merry way so he said if you ever need somebody else, call me.  So for a whole month I called him and the phone number wasn't connected.  So then finally he called, I went up to [DEIDENTIFIED] again and asked if he was, where he was.  They said they hadn't seen him so then he called me and then I said well where have you been.  He said well, he said something about his dog dying.  I should have known when he said his dog died.  His dog died and he didn't want to go out so he went into rehab.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He said he went into rehab, that's what he told me.  So he came over, he did more labor and again we spent, I asked him if he wanted to go a couple of places with me to look at furniture because he was going to be able to put it together.  So he said yeah, so he came with me and again he said I don't have anything to do, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and you know, anyway it came about, I forget the whole but it came about that he said that he was put out of the place that he was staying because of back rent.  I said okay.  I said you can't stay here but I said you can stay this week only because my boarder is not here.  So I let him stay.  He stayed on the couch but what I did wrong was I let him stay, because he said he was going to [DEIDENTIFIED] the next day at eleven o'clock.  He said he had an appointment to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] which is up on [DEIDENTIFIED], it's like a one day.  I should have know he was lying then too because they don't go at eleven, they go earlier I think.  But anyway, so I said okay, so I said just lock up and then whatever.  So the next day he stayed on the couch and he was very reluctant to do anything that I asked him to do, like he didn't want to be bothered or whatever and so he left the same time I left.  He went out front, in front of the house.
<b>DR:</b> Sure, sure.
<b>PT:</b> But when I went to the back of the house 5 minutes later, I saw him coming out of the basement.  First of all, something crashed in my basement, something crashed in my basement so that got me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I just thought the cats had knocked something over but then when I went to the window, I saw him leaving and coming around.  I saw him leave and go around toward the front.  Well 2 minutes later I went to the front, he was sitting on the front porch again but didn't say.  I said are you all right and he said yeah I'm fine.  He said I just don't feel good today.  I said well then why don't you stay, you know, just lay down or something.  So he said no, he said if I get moving I'll be all right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But that incident, it just gave me a bad, there was no reason why he couldn't have knocked on the door because he knew I was in there and come in the front, you know, and why do you knock something over and not pick it back up because it wasn't picked up when I was down the basement, you know, so I just had a bad, a bad feeling.  So all day I had a bad feelings, so I told her I'm going home.  So I got home around two thirty.  He was sitting in [NAME OTHER]'s bedroom on the floor going through her CDs, just looking, you know, she has this big thing, just turning the pages.  
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] is your boarder?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, so I had to him what are you doing?  He says I'm looking at her CDs.  So I said get out.  So I made him leave.  He said you've got it all wrong, you've got it all wrong, I didn't do anything, you know, you've got it all wrong and he leaves, you know.  So I happen to call, I called him and I called her.  I called [NAME OTHER] to ask them to keep an eye on the house in case he would come back.
<b>DR:</b> That's a neighbor?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I don't know how he got in the house. I think he took a key but I wasn't sure, you know, but, so [NAME OTHER] says to me, oh yeah, he asked me for 20 bucks to fix your telephone.  He said I didn't give him any money.  He said I'm not giving this stranger money.  He said I'll give it to you but he said I'm not giving a stranger money.  So then I, you know, so then I went and confronted him.  I had all his tools.  I had about $300 worth of his tools in my house, which he's not getting back.  I'm just going to tell him that the person that stole the rest of the stuff stole his tools. 
<b>DR:</b> So what was stolen?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it wasn't my stuff, it was her stuff.  She claims, now this is another, another little twist.  She has resented paying rent, you know, because she's not there during the summer and her clothes are and I still charge her and she still pays the rent but she don't like doing that, so she gave me a whole list of things.  I called her and I told her, I said if someone comes around the house, don't let them in.  So when she came home, she went in her room and I don't know how long she was in there, you see I can't remember how long she was in that room but she came out and she goes oh my God there's things missing, blah, blah, blah.  She gave me a list of things missing.  As the week went on, she found this, she found that, she found her school ring but not her mother's.  Under her bed was a box of CDs with two of my CDs in it but not much of my stuff in it.  They were in my, I think that the one thing was downstairs but the others were upstairs.  I can't understand why he would bring an audiotape upstairs.  I even gave him a bicycle to get around on.  I gave him a bicycle. 
<b>DR:</b> But none of your stuff was missing. 
<b>PT:</b> Not much.  So my theory is, I think, I'm not sure he actually took it.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know.  My theory is that she, very quickly, arranged for a little, I think she might have pawned her mother's stuff.
<b>DR:</b> You sound more like you don't trust her than you don't trust him.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't trust either of them but it's just, it's more, she, I asked her sixteen times to give me the receipts.  I'm paying for everything as well. 
<b>DR:</b> How long has she been -
<b>PT:</b> With me?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Three years.
<b>DR:</b> You had a male boarder before that, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he went back to his girlfriend [INAUDIBLE] because he went a little nuts.
<b>DR:</b> Drinking, yeah, I remember that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so.
<b>DR:</b> But this woman's at the shore a lot.
<b>PT:</b> She's at her mothers a lot.
<b>DR:</b> In the summertime.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  And even on the weekends in the winter, so financially it just, somethings not right.  Plus she has flea markets where she sells tapes and stuff, CDs and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Something is just not right.
<b>DR:</b> Well.
<b>PT:</b> I think she's been going in my bedroom and using the phone.  I got a whole bunch to [DEIDENTIFIED] phone numbers on my bill.  Now I call her too so I have to look at the bill again.  I just looked at it yesterday and said whoa, she's been using this, so she's been going in my bedroom since [DATE].  I have to look at the thing to see when this actually took place.  And before I thought money was missing. 
<b>DR:</b> Well, I guess the way to test on that is use your cell phone to call [DEIDENTIFIED] for the next month, the next billing cycle.
<b>PT:</b> Well, that's what I'm going to do.
<b>DR:</b> You know, and see if there's any phone calls.
<b>PT:</b> In fact, I thought of that this morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, use your cell.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I'm not going to say anything to her until the next bill and then I'm going to confront her with both bills.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Then I'm going to ask also for a bill in March, ask them for a bill in March.  I'm not paying.  And she's been dialing directory assistance which is  $1.95.  So I don't know, I don't know what to believe.  She's very upset that I didn't go to her birthday party.
<b>DR:</b> And you still need to have her as a boarder [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it sounds like you'll be able to work things out just be real careful about who you invite in your house.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that was my fault, I should have not left him in my house.  I guess I was in a mood too, I need to trust somebody and you're it.  Hey, you're it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it's the same kind of thing you just said, it's cruel to be kind with cats, the same pattern with yourself, you know, with new boarders.
<b>PT:</b> Well I get these.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes I think too kind can cause problems too so.  But it sounds like, again, your paranoia is pretty much in check.  I mean there's still some there but it sounds like you're functioning well.  I mean are you taking the Abilify?  Half the time?
<b>PT:</b> Half the time.
<b>DR:</b> Or none of the time.
<b>PT:</b> Some of the time.
<b>DR:</b> Did you take it last night?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you didn't sleep all night.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.   Well, especially on nights when you're not sleeping particularly well, you know, or you're up all night.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a couple of nights.  I don't know what it was.  [NAME OTHER] is in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I know it makes no sense to talk about [NAME OTHER] but I still, I have a hard time letting go of him.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  You don't see him at work, right?
<b>PT:</b> No.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Let's see, eight weeks, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, [DATE].
<b>PT:</b> [DATE], two days after her birthday.  I don't know what to do about, I don't listen to reason, I'm only [INAUDIBLE], I don't even listen to me.  I've got to take this cat back home, put him upstairs.  I talk to much.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to keep this at all?  
<b>PT:</b> No.
DR; Okay.  [INAUDIBLE]  I'll see you.
<b>PT:</b> Sounds good.
