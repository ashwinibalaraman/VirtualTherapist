<i>The shadow on the door told Scheherazade that the king was listening.<br />
Her life would be spared only as long as she kept him listening.<br />
And so she began to weave a fascinating story web</i>...


--The Arabian Nights


The Desert Hot Springs Scheherazade's Sisters feels like an echo
of our little ragtag women's group back home in Flagstaff. It meets
every Monday evening. There is a core group of loyalists, most of
whom show up every time: Nora, Candace, Barb, Helen, Sharon,
Delfina, K-Siu, and me. Other women drift in, stay awhile, then
are gone. They move away, get a nighttime job, go to school. Or
they aren't ready to give up their annihilating hobby.


We begin at 6:00 PM. We waste no time. We dive into a
plate of sand tarts or double-deadly fudge brownies or sliced fruit
(which Nora piously brings and which elicits moans of disappointment)
and slam down coffee.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then we go to work. Sometimes I'm reminded of pioneer
women piecing together quilts, but instead of patching together
a comforter from old velvet or new cotton, we make a crazy quilt
of horror, of heartache, of the most fun we've ever had, of the
maddening pain of withdrawal, and of the hard hours of slipping
back. Other times we become a gang of teenage girls, full of "he
saids" and "I saids." There are the nights when one of us is so
filled with pain or fear that she has no choice but to sob wordlessly
or tremble while the women on either side of her put their
arms around her. Always, we are a circle of Scheherazades, telling
stories and buying, with our honesty, a reprieve for what's left of
the day, and maybe even the next.


Nobody gives advice. Nobody nags. We are too scarred and
too smart for that. We talk, we listen, and sometimes we bring
in new information or healing practice. I've been in the circle
almost a year when Delfina comes up with an idea. "My kid just
came back from treatment for <i>mota</i>... pot," she says. "The counselors
had her write out her autobiography. I've been thinking we
could do that, and one of us can read during the first half of the
circle for a while."


Helen flinches. "Oh jeez. I'm seventy-two. Even if my life
was boring up till I found the casinos, it'll take a year for me to
read my story."


"What if," Delfina says, "we keep it to two pages. Some of
us--not me, oh no--are chatty chicks, so that'll make us get to
the point."


She agrees to go first the following week.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Delfina is a softly beautiful fifty-five-year-old woman. Her perfectly
made-up eyes are dark, what lies behind them both warm
and sorrowful. The first night she came into our circle, her eyes
were only frightened. There was no delicately drawn liner, no eye
shadow in shades of faintest dawn. She wore faded green sweats,
and her curls were pinned up on top of her head.


Now she is the fashion forerunner of the group. Make that
<i>found</i> fashion forerunner. Her gambling took her and her family
down to survival level, so when she shops, it's at secondhand
stores. The night she reads her story, she wears see-through plastic
four-inch-heel sandals. "Turn out the lights," she says. We do.
"Okay, <i>chicas,</i> she laughs. "Check this out!"


Her shoes begin to flash red and green and yellow. "They've
got little Christmas tree lights in the heels. And guess what? I got
them at that hospice secondhand store," she says. "Four bucks.


"Okay, now you can turn on the lights. I'm going to read
my story."


<i>I am going to use my native language sometimes in this. There are
ideas that can't be accurately said in English. The most important
thing about me is that I was the first one in my family--my huge family
--to go to college. The least important thing about me is that I--a
devout Catholic--tried to kill myself five years ago so I wouldn't have
to tell my beloved viejo that I had dragged myself, him, and our three
kids $75,000 into debt with no way to pay the next month's bills</i>.


<i>Mi madre was one of nine living children, my father one of
seven. She was Mayan from Michoacán. He was third-generation
American, originally from Sinaloa. They are the hardest-working
people I have ever known</i>.



[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Then, somethinghappened.Youknow.Thatkindofsomething....
This pinche cabron, this bad, bad man and his poor, sad wife--they
moved next door to us. We would hear shouting at night, sometimes
screams, that awful thud of a body crashing against a wall. Maybe
you don't know, maybe you do</i>.


<i>One day, he</i>...


Delfina looks down at her hands.


...<i>he got me. And he told me that if I told anybody, he would kidnap
Didi and kill him before anybody knew</i>.


<i>So I didn't tell. Instead, I decided I would study so hard that I
would go to the big white high school north of us, and then I would go
to college, and I would never ever let anybody hurt a kid again</i>.


<i>That was all fine, but I also stopped talking. I shut myself off
from my family and my girlfriends. Only La Senora, the Virgin of
Guadalupe, knew what had happened. I would go to our little church
and kneel in front of her, and I would pray anything I wanted. Like,
"Where was your blue-eyed son when I needed him?" or "Where was
God hiding?" or "Help me keep my promises to myself."</i>


<i>I kept my promises. When I graduated from the state university
with my master's in social work, my whole family was there. I was</i>

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Life was normal. I worked. My husband worked. I had two
more kids. The deal is when you are Mexican there are always relatives
to take care of the kids. So the kids didn't have to go to any
skanky daycare center. They got love and menudo and gentle whacks
on the butt. Everything was moving along right on track</i>.


<i>Except for the lousy dreams I had a few times a week--about
the pinche cabron</i>.


<i>And then, some of the girls at work asked me if I wanted to go
to the new Indian casino for dinner and a show. They were all giggling
and teasing me about being so straitlaced. We went. My best
friend sat me down at a slot machine. I never made it to dinner or
the show</i>.


<i>What really pisses me off so bad now is that I am a substance
abuse counselor. I was listening to people with troubles like ours till
five o'clock, then I was out the door four nights a week to the casino.
I lost ten years of my life being more estúpida than any of my
clients. And the only good thing was I had stopped dreaming about
the pinche cabron</i>.


<i>Now? I'm clean and, guess what, chicas? The pinche cabron is
back in my dreams. It's a small price to pay for what I've gained,
and I am thinking maybe it's time for me to face him down once and
for all</i>.


There's a long silence. Delfina shrugs. "Hey, I'm okay right
now, you know?"

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

K-Siu looks at her gravely. "I am sad and angry to hear about
that <i>pinche cabron</i>. He will come to his fate."


"Just what," Nora says, "<i>is a pinche cabron?</i>"


"A fucking butthead," Delfina says. "That's what he was, and
that's what he probably still is."


"We ought to turn ourselves into guerrilla girls and track him
down," Candace says. "I was lucky. Nothing like that happened to
me. But I had some bad juju going for me from the time I was little,
too." She volunteers to go next week. As soon as she offers this,
she sighs ruefully. "Dang," she marvels, "did any of you ever notice
how once you start coming to this group, you say stuff you didn't
want to say? Like miss goody-two-shoes me will talk next week."


Sharon laughs. "Miss goody-two-shoes? Me, too. I used to
hate women who were all goody-two-shoes. Gambling was my
secret self, the tough chick whose favorite two-word sentence is
<i>Fuck you</i>. Second-favorite sentence: <i>Leave me alone</i>. And now?
<i>I'm</i> miss goody-two-shoes just like you. Go figure."


We circle up again the following Monday. Candace waits until
we have all checked in. She's forty-two, willow-supple, her grace
that of the dancer she still is--except now her dancing is in community
theater rather than around a pole. The first thing you
notice about her are her hands. Her fingers are long and slim. She
wears a ring on three fingers of each hand. The second thing you
notice are her eyes. They're black-cat green, and she doesn't need
makeup. She looked good the first evening she joined us. "It's all
I have left," she had said. "At least I can comb my hair and figure
out what top goes with what pants. At least I can do that."

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After the last of us has finished with our check-ins, Candace
dives right in.


I <i>was a selfish little bitch from the first instant I caught on that if I
played cute, or sobbed real hard, or threw a hissy fit that it brought
the neighbors running. My good old dad would do anything for me. I
was his little princess. My mom was doing face plants in her booze--
sleeping pills can keep a woman kinda drowsy. We lived in Georgia,
and it was understood that women of her class were a little fragile.
So, cut to the chase, I knew how to work men from the git. Then I
naturally grew these tatas you see on me, and it was Miss Candace's
March through Georgia</i>.


<i>I met Lenny. He was a professional gambler. A good profes'
sional gambler, which was about the only thing he was any good at.
He sweet-talked me into running away from home. I was sixteen going
on Mae West. "You've got attributes," he said, "that can make
you a million dollars. But not in Macon. I've got pals in Vegas.
We're heading west."</i>


<i>I dang near fainted the first time Lenny drove onto The Strip.
It was 1983, and The Boys were stilling running the place. Out in
front of the Starlite there was this peacock fan about two stories tall
made out of pink and red and purple lights. I made Lenny stop the
car. I got out and stood in the middle of the street and screamed, "I'm
in heaven!" Nobody minded because it was about 105 degrees and I
was wearing hot pants and a bikini top and five-inch spike heels</i>.


<i>Two weeks later, somehow, Golden Luck Lenny was broke.
We were in an SRO roach hotel. And I was Candylicious, dancing
on the bar in a little mom 'n' pop strip joint. That lasted a month,
long enough for me to figure out where the big bucks were--in old</i>

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I met the men I wanted to meet. Let's just say I met old men, lonely
old men who never knew what hit them once Candace, Southern
Damsel with a master's in What-You-Want showed up. I didn't have
to do a damn thing but look at them adoringly and listen to them
natter on and on and on. I made enough with "a little help from my
friends" in the first week to get my own place and make a plan</i>.


Candace stops. We wait. We learned early on that sometimes a
woman's silence is as important as her words. "This gets pretty
ugly," Candace says. "I don't have to read it. It was enough to
write it, see it in my own writing, you know. See the worst of it."
She looks at Helen. "It's pretty X-rated."


"You know," Helen says quietly, "I may be an old woman
with a flag pin on her blouse and a cross on her necklace, but I
can tell you that there is more than one way for a woman to be a
paid woman. Please keep going."


"I didn't graduate to prostitution," Candace says. "In some
ways that would have been more honest." She takes a deep breath
and continues:


<i>Pretty soon I narrowed my area of specialization to married old
guys. I added blackmail into my trick bag. Over the next fifteen
years, I was partly responsible for at least a dozen ugly divorces and
one woman's suicide</i>.



[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Wrong. Ten years after that sweet old guy's sweet old wife killed
herself, I found myself cutting up my dead credit cards, asking a
friend to take my beloved shar pei for a few days, and lying down for
the kind of restful sleep you can get from a full bottle of Demerol</i>.


<i>Here's the instant karma part: The Demerol didn't work</i>.


"Two out of two so far," Sharon says. "I read that the suicide
rate for gamblers is higher than for any other addiction. I never
tried it, but that's only because I'm a complete chicken."


"Candace, you haven't made a bet for ten years, right?"
Nora asks.


"Right."


"How did you go from being a total woman-hating bitch to
our sister in that time?"


"Who says I'm not still a woman-hating bitch?" Candace
grins. "You ladies are the exception to the rule. You try working
as a coat-check chick in a yuppie restaurant and tell me how
much you like your sisters!"


We repair to caffeine and carbs. Helen has baked old-time
Toll House cookies. We warm them in the microwave in the seniors'
cafeteria and settle back in.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Helen, you are a goddess," Candace says, "but that doesn't
let you off the hook. I want to know what you meant by 'there's
more than one way for a woman to be a paid woman.'"


"Not till next week," Helen says softly, "I'll read my story
next week."


Delfina calls me a couple days before the next meeting. "Would
you talk to Helen? She called me. She's having a terrible time
writing. I figured maybe, you being a writer and all, you could
help her."


Helen picks up the phone on the second ring. "Mary, I am so
sorry. I feel like such an idiot. I can't do this."


"You don't have to," I tell her. "It's only supposed to be a
tool."


"I do have to do it. You don't understand. I'm the oldest person
in the group--five years older than you even. Sometimes I
listen to all of you and all I can think is that the only interesting
thing I ever did in my life was hitting that $5,000 progressive
jackpot on Wheel of Fortune. I have to write this, or I'll feel like
an old fool."


"Do you want me to help? I used to teach writing. It's probably
the one thing I'm not scared of."


There is a pause. "We could do that. The sooner the better."


An hour later, Helen and I are sitting on her patio in the
shade of a lush clump of yucca. The scent of flowers fills the air. A
small fountain trickles into a shining koi pond.


"I did all of this," Helen says. "My husband thinks it's a waste
of money, but I needed something for my soul."

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She pauses. "My soul. I'm beginning to understand that my
gambling hurt my soul. Do you know what I mean?"


I look into her kind face. I know we might have hugely different
definitions of soul. "I do know."


"So," Helen says, "can you help me write these impossible
two pages?"


"I will. We need paper, a pen, and a kitchen timer."


When she returns I say, "Here you go. You set the timer for
twenty minutes. I'll give you an opening sentence. I'll start the
timer, and you'll write. No matter what, keep the pen moving. If
you get stuck, just write something like 'I can't do this. I'm stuck.
I hate Mary. I'm leaving.' Anything, but just keep the pen moving.
Here's your opening sentence: 'I have my own story to tell.'"


Twenty minutes later, Helen indeed has the beginning of her
own story to tell.


"What next?" she says.


"I leave. You set the timer, and you write the next section."


Helen calls that night. "Now what do I do with the ten pages I
wrote?"


"Take out the scalpel," I say, "and cut away everything but
the soul."


The Helen who walks into the next meeting of the Sisters
is not quite the Helen we'd known before. She sits in her chair
quietly and waits instead of making sure each of us has coffee just
the way we like it and more than enough cookies.


We fill our plates and cups. Sharon brings Helen a cup of tea.
Cookies have been off-limits for Helen for ten years because of

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Helen has described herself to us as "a medium woman--
medium weight, medium height, medium wrinkles, medium gray
hair, medium aches and pains, medium except in how I, well you
know, went nuts with those damn machines."


We do our check-ins. Candace finishes last and nods at Helen.
"Break a leg."


Helen smiles. "Feels like I already did. Here goes."


<i>I have my own story to tell. It's most likely different from you girls',
partly because I'm seventy-two, but even more because I'm a country
Okie, born, raised, and bred. I've noticed most of you come
from cities or suburbs. When I was born there were no such things
as suburbs, especially not in Sallisaw, Oklahoma. It was 1935, and
we were maybe seventeen hundred folks, mostly cotton farmers, a
few loggers and miners...and their families of course</i>.


<i>My pop ran a little café. My mom ran us. Till she took sick
with lung fever. I was the oldest of six kids, so at nine I became the
second mom. We got hit bad by the Great Depression. My pop was
able to hang on. Besides the bakery, his cafe was the only place to get
a decent meal. He and my mom knew how to squeeze a nickel till the
eagle hollered and how to make home-fry potatoes and onions that
folks swore were better than a whole Thanksgiving dinner</i>.


<i>Hard as times were, we were a proud family in a proud town.
When that John Steinbeck wrote his book about Okies and the Dust
Bowl, a lot of Sallisaw got plain irked. He claimed the Joad family was
from Sallisaw, and that was nonsense. We didn't have a drought, and
we were the hardest-working people you'd have ever met</i>.



[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>That was the last real excitement Sallisaw had till Bill Hedge put
in his racetrack, Blue Ribbon Downs, in 1960. You couldn't legally
bet on the races, but I can tell you there were plenty of deals going
down in my pop's cafe</i>.


<i>My mom died when I was twelve. I had my hands full. It looked
like I was going to turn out to be one of those old maids no girl in
her right mind wanted to be. Besides, we were hard-shell Baptists,
and my pop was right fussy about any boy being good enough for
his girls</i>.


<i>Till a new blacksmith came to town, set eyes on me slicing up pie
in the café, and that was all she wrote</i>.


<i>I married Jim Brooker, had five kids, and was a faithful member
of my local church. The only gambling I'd done--and I didn't count
it as gambling--was Bingo Night at the VFW hall. Then the Ladies
Auxiliary decided to go to the buffet over at the brand-new Choctaw
Casino. I was a grandma twelve times over by then and a great-grandma
of three. Jim was retired. It was 2005. You should have
seen us girls. We got all dressed up and decided that if we gambled,
we'd each play $20 apiece and put what we won in the Widows and
Orphans fund</i>.


<i>None of us had ever gambled in a casino before. I didn't know
then that going to bingo every Thursday night, rain or shine, sick
with a cold or not, counted as gambling. My Jim used to play the ponies,
and rumor had it that May Jenkins's husband, Bill, had gotten</i>

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>But then a few weeks later, I was home with Jim driving me
nuts--what is it about men and retirement? He'd never taken an interest
in anything I did till he got his gold watch. All of a sudden he was
an expert on my cooking, washing clothes, mopping, dusting--without
doing any of it, I might add. I told him I was going down to the library
to take a computer class. He grunted, and I was out the door</i>.


<i>The only computer I set eyes on that day and many days after
was a slot machine</i>.


<i>Between tornadoes, winter temperatures of negative fifteen, and
the worry about my husband finding out about the secret casino hours
of my life, I was only too happy when he suggested it was time for us
to head west. We picked up a nice older double-wide in Desert Hot
Springs in 2006. For a while, I was happy just to get settled in, plant
a garden, play a little bingo at the Catholic Church, and learn how to
email my Sallisaw girlfriends</i>.


<i>Then May and a couple other gals paid a visit. They were all
sparkly-eyed when we picked them up at the airport. They were like
kids with a secret. Only later, after Jim had settled in with his football
game, did they drag me out to the patio and show me a flyer from the
big casino in Palm Springs</i>.


<i>That was the beginning of the next beginning of the end. You
know the rest of the story</i>.


"Excuse me," K-Siu says, "I don't mean to be rude, but where
is the part about you?"

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sharon nods. "I know more than I ever guessed I'd know
about Sallisaw, Oklahoma, more than I care to know about
Jim, and not enough about when you were little or young or
middle-aged."


"There was no part about me," Helen says, "until I really
started to gamble. Up until then all I was about was my husband,
my kids, my grandkids, my great-grandkids, the Ladies
Auxiliary, and my sick mom. I couldn't have told you what color
I liked, the last book I read, or even what color my eyes were.
I remember the time I walked into that fancy casino and saw the
empty seat at my favorite slot machine and thought, <i>This is all
mine. Just mine. There is nobody else but me here</i>."


Helen pauses for a moment and adds, "That me is gone now,
too. I kind of miss her. She was funny and mean, and she knew
how to have fun. But there's more of me now, since the year I've
been meeting with you ladies, than there was in seventy-two
years of my life."


"So what about your favorite color, a book you read, and your
eyes?" Barb asks.


"My favorite color's blue-green, I read a whole Margaret Coel
mystery last week, and my eyes are cloudy gray."


"I still want to know what you meant," Candace says gently,
"when you said that there's more than one way for a woman to
be a paid woman."


Helen's faint smile is pure ice. "I can't believe I'm going to
say this. Imagine sleeping with a man you couldn't stand for thirty-nine
years--because you needed the security."


She pats Candace's hand. "You see, there is more than one
way for a woman to earn her keep."

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Let's take our break," Helen says, "That wore me out."


We are closing the circle when K-Siu blurts out, "I will go
next. I am a little like Helen. I, too, come from people who lived
in a small village. My people are traditional and religious. But I'll
tell the rest next week."


The night of K-Siu's reading she wears a long, high-necked satin
dress, slit to the knee in the same scarlet as her precious rubies.
"I wear an <i>ao dai,"</i> she says. "It is not my native clothing because
the skirt and blouse and headdress my mother brought over from
Vietnam were taken by the people at Customs. We never learned
why." K-Siu is a short, sturdy woman with warm, dark skin and
mahogany eyes. She is forty-two, the mother of three. She always
wears a gold charm bracelet with six rubies hanging from it.
"These are for my mother, my father, my husband, and for Nicky,
Wynne, and William." She waits till we are all settled in, then
she begins:


<i>I am not Vietnamese. I am Bru. My mother and father taught us
as small children that we were not Vietnamese. We were Bru. My
people are one of the tribes of the Degar. We are highland dwellers--
what's left of us. The French called us Montagnards. We call ourselves
Degar. It means sons of the mountains. My name is not Bru.
It is the name of a Degar nurse who was buried alive by the South
Vietnamese just before the American War ended. My mother and
father taught us that to remember our people is the essence of being
Degar. They were from the village of Lang Troai on the Sepong

<i>Gambling has always been a tradition in our family, as it is for
many Degar and Vietnamese. Because I grew up in the States, I don't
know much about the games the men played back in the village, but
we follow the Vietnamese custom of gambling at Tet, our New Year.
We play Bau cua ca cop, a dice game. The dice are very beautiful,
not like the numbered ones. The six sides of the dice have pictures of
a fish, prawn, crab, rooster, calabash gourd, and stag. Sometimes I
dream of them. And of my parents' hands holding them</i>.


<i>And there is an old game, the same as keno here. My mother
laughs when she hears one of her friends wants to go to the casino
to play keno. "Not keno," my mother says, "White Pigeon Ticket.
The game has been called White Pigeon Ticket for hundreds of years.
Then, white pigeons; now, sparkly lights and buzzers</i>."


<i>For most of the Bru I think gambling was just a game, but the
Vietnamese regard gambling as the worst vice among the four vices
of womanizing, drinking, taking drugs, and gambling. I tell you these
things because to tell of my life is too hard. And I want you to know
that always, for me, gambling was like the yin and the yang. There
were the beautiful dice of Tet, and there are the ugly effects of what
I did</i>.


<i>Bru are not Buddhists. Some are Christian, many were and
still are people who believed in the spirit in everything. But we also
believe, as the Buddhists do, that what we do has consequences. And
we cannot outrun those consequences. I live with the consequences
of my foolishness every day</i>.


<i>I have told you about my sadness over the loss of my husband.
I caused it with my love of the dice and White Pigeon Ticket. I have</i>

<i>I can't write more</i>.


The group is silent. K-Siu sits calmly with her hands folded
in her lap. And then she says, "If you want to ask me questions, I
can try to answer them."


I half expect one of us to ask her about what she had done
that had left her with so much shame, but that is because I have
forgotten we do not pry--ever.


"I wonder about one thing," Nora says. "What is the meaning
of the white pigeons?"


K-Siu smiles. "White Pigeon Ticket was a kind of lottery. It
began in China long ago. Gambling was outlawed there, so the
gamblers set up their shops in the countryside, where the police
could not find them so easily. The city gamblers made their bets
on paper tickets, tied them to the legs of white pigeons--our
homing pigeons--and set them free. The pigeons carried the
bets to the gambling shops. After the lottery numbers had been
drawn, the gambling shops sent word to the winners by pigeon. I
used to imagine the pigeons wobbling home because they would
have so much paper money wrapped around their legs."


Delfina laughs. "My husband and his brothers keep pigeons
for racing--and betting. I tease him about it, but he and I both
know I have the gambling virus and he doesn't."

We move on to telling how our weeks have been, what has
been hard, what has been easy. At the end of our time, Nora says,
"I'll go next week. I need to get it over with."


The next week Nora races in the door at the last minute. "I'm so
sorry," she says, "but Sarah came down with a stomach bug, and
Jen was late coming home from work, and by the time we got it
all straightened out, I had twenty minutes to get here, and the
traffic was insane."


Nora is a sturdy thirty-two-year-old redhead who lives
with her partner, Jen, and Jen's daughter, Sarah. She's an endearing
mix of radical chic and practical. She's wearing her
John Lennon granny glasses and a long, flowered skirt along
with her favorite Carhartt carpenter's vest and skateboarding
sneakers. She's a woodworker, both parquet and fine cabinetry.
And she is quick to show off the Lesbians Love Lucy button on
her backpack.


She grabs her two basic food groups, ginger dreams and coffee,
and settles in to read:


<i>The best way you could describe Scheherazade's Sisters is a blend of
old-time consciousness-raising group, old-time twelve-step meeting,
and United Nations, where I'd be the representative of Gayavania</i>.


<i>You'd be surprised how many of us enlightened, political lesbians
are gambling junkies. I'll never forget the time I had snuck off
to my favorite gambling haunt, quaint little Laughlin, Nevada; was
snuggled down with my favorite poker machine; and heard all this
shrieking coming from the escalator</i>.



[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>There's an old joke you used to see written on the stalls of ladies'
rooms: "My mother made me a lesbian</i>."


<i>"Cool! If I give her some yarn will she make me one, too?"</i>


<i>Nobody made me a lesbian. I was born with the gift. And nobody
made me a gambler. I figure I was born with the curse. My family
is totally cool, liberal Unitarian, Mom and Dad married for forty
years, Mom and Dad both work, but Mom raised me and my sister
and brother at home till the oldest was five. No creep ever touched
me. No mythological butch gym teacher ever lured me into the shower.
All I know is I remember being four years old in preschool when
the new kid, Janey Whatever, walked in and I couldn't breathe</i>.


<i>In case you don't know, not being able to breathe is the first sign
of a fatal romantic attraction. I didn't even know there was anything
weird about how I felt. I drew a beautiful black horse on a piece of
paper and gave it to her. That was the extent of the romance</i>.


<i>I didn't think it was weird either when I was in fifth grade and
found a gang of boys who played poker for money once a week. I was
the only chick. The first second Ricky dealt me my cards, I had that
same out-of-breath feeling, and the first time I bet 5 bucks, I thought
I was going to suffocate. I should have paid attention</i>.


<i>Down the road, being gay saved my life and my heart; gambling
nearly burned them to a crisp</i>.


<i>I've worked since I was twelve. I grew up in a suburb that was
going global. I'd hang out on the construction sites and do anything</i>

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>By the time I was sixteen, I was working part-time for a crew
that put custom cupboards and doors into otherwise-cheap-shit trophy
mansions. By the time I was eighteen, I had my own crew. We
specialized in projects no other crew would take on. And we specialized
in two-hour lunches of taco cart nutrition, beer, and poker</i>.


<i>I quit the beer and the poker when I met Jen. I was twenty-six.
She was thirty. She had a kid, Sarah, who I've adopted. Everything
was great for three years. Then the local tribe built a casino ten minutes
from our home</i>.


<i>I started out with poker, loved Texas Hold 'Em. Then, as the
jones advanced, poker was too slow. So I slid myself right down the
social scale of gamblers and began to hit the slots</i>.


Nora pauses. She pulls a wad of slot cards out of a vest pocket,
a pair of scissors out of her pack. "I didn't write this part of my
story, because I just wanted to say it--and here I go!" She takes
the first card and cuts it into strips. Barb pulls the wastebasket
over. Nora drops the strips into the basket, takes the second card,
and slivers it.


"I've been coming here for two years, but I just couldn't bring
myself to cut up these cards till after I wrote my story and got my
butt in here tonight."

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She drops the last plastic shard into the wastebasket and
shrugs. "There! That's all she wrote."


We applaud. Nora takes a little bow.


Sharon and I flip a coin to see who will go next. I win. "Guess
it's me," Sharon says, "but aren't we supposed to count that as
gambling?" It's one of the few times a Sister gets booed.


The following week, Sharon pulls two neatly written pages out
of her leather purse. She brushes a strand of silver-white hair
away from her eyes and grins. She is the epitome of careless
class. Whenever I see her I think of how people say that Parisian
women can toss on a T-shirt and jeans and look more elegant
that <i>any</i> woman in formal wear. Sharon is forty-nine with
the body of a healthy thirty-year-old. We all work hard not to
hate her.


"I love what I'm going to read," she says. "I actually wrote it
before as part of a longer bio when I was in treatment. The rest
of my history is pretty dull preppie, so I figured you'd rather hear
this. It's really about a woman helping another woman--almost
unintentionally, just because she's being friendly. I try to remember
that kind of helping now.


"This may seem weird, but my story's in third person. I was
so ashamed those first months in treatment that I needed to work
out some things this way."


<i>Nobody knew. Not her husband. Not her boss. Not her minister.
Not her therapist. Certainly not her kids. Not even Ramon, her
warm and irreverent hairstylist, who knew about everything else</i>.



[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>She might have held on to her lonely and terrifying knowledge
forever had Ramon's nail technician not talked her into a new shade
of polish. Sharon had always gone with sedate. Pale beige-pink, maybe
something a little brighter if there was a special party. But when
Amber showed her the tiny French bottle--Cinnabar--and Sharon
saw how the dark mineral red made her pale skin elegant, she told
Amber to go ahead</i>.


<i>Five hours later Sharon was at the casino. She'd told Bob she
had to work late and that she'd left a bowl of pasta primavera in the
fridge for him and the kids. As always, he said, "Got it covered,
babe," and that was that</i>.


<i>Sharon decided to try a new machine. She'd had her eye on
a twenty-line penny slot with alluring sun and moon symbols that
gleamed as they signaled a bonus. She took $ 100 from the ATM and
settled in</i>.


<i>By 11:45, Sharon had maxed out her available withdrawals
from her debit card: $500. She made herself go to the snack bar for
a yogurt, forced herself to swallow the gooey stuff, and knew enough
not to order the coffee she badly wanted. She might leave. She might
drive woozily home. She might remember she had a 7:00 am meeting
the next morning. She would have to sleep, and even the bad casino
coffee would tap-dance in her head</i>.


<i>She went back to the ATM and slid in her card. Funds unavailable
at this time. Bob must have paid some bills</i>.


<i>She slid in the blue card. Nothing. The shiny silver card. Nothing.
Finally, she slid in the high-interest card she'd surreptitiously ordered from
a magazine. Nothing. She could feel someone standing behind her</i>.



[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Sharon turned. "I'm okay," she said. "I'll just be a second. There
must be a computer error. Or maybe I just have to wait till midnight."</i>


<i>The woman looked puzzled. "No," she said. "I'm not in a hurry.
We both gotta wait till midnight anyhow to take out more money.
I was just watching your fingers. That polish completely rocks."</i>


<i>Sharon looked down at her hands. To this day, she has no idea
why what came next arrived. She saw her five fingernails gleaming in
the neon. She saw her hands. She thought of all the other ways she
used them, and she put the last credit card back in her purse</i>.


<i>"Thank you," she said. "It's called Cinnabar. My nail turned
me on to it."</i>


<i>The girl nodded. "Listen," she said, "you look a little funny.
Are you okay?"</i>


<i>"No," Sharon said. "Not really."</i>


<i>And that was the beginning of the end</i>.


<i>Sharon left the casino. The air outside was filled with exhaust
from the cars pulling in and out of the parking lot. She looked up past
the big, gorgeous sign. She couldn't see a damn thing of the night
sky</i>.


<i>She drove home, and for a week she didn't say anything to anybody.
And then, she made an appointment with Ramon. He would
be the first to know. It would be a long time between telling Ramon
and telling another person, and even by then, she wouldn't be sure
she wanted to stop</i>.


<i>There's her story. And it's all mine</i>.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Where's Ramon at?" Candace says with sisterly compassion.
"I've always loved your hair!"


"That's my deepest, darkest secret," Sharon says. "He's already
booked to the tits. He'd love me saying that. Pretty boring
deepest, darkest secret for a woman who once considered herself
a chick outlaw gambler."


We finish out the meeting. "You're next," Sharon says. "But
I think you should have to say it rather than write it. You know
how you writers are."


"We're professional liars," I say. "I'll just improvise."


I hadn't shared with the circle that I can speak publicly as easily
as I can write, but the night it's my turn I seem to have forgotten
everything I know about just letting go and letting the words
happen. I sit in three chairs before one of them feels remotely
comfortable. Barb brings me a cup of decaf. "You don't need high
octane," she says, "You're jittering so much the chair is bouncing.
" She and the others sit down.


"Okay," I say, "I'm starting," and promptly begin to cry.
"Okay," I say. "Now I'm really starting." I choke back my tears.
"Any second now," I say. My voice shakes so much I can't do anything
but shut up.


Candace hands me a tissue. Sharon puts her arm around me.
K-Siu sits across from me and looks calmly into my eyes. "Okay!"
I say. "Here I go." A few minutes later I'm finally able to speak.


<i>When I was five years old I was alone with my mother when she had
her first psychotic break. No, wait, first off, I am a classic addict:</i>

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>This is how I became a classic addict as best as I can piece it
together. Let's go back to the little girl kept home from kindergarten
because her mom was afraid to be alone. She's in her parents' big bed
because that's what you get to do when you stay home from school.
You get tomato soup and peanut butter toast, and your mother puts
on the radio, and together you listen to soap operas. Except this time,
there was no radio coming from the kitchen. Instead, there was just a
crazy singing that sounded like it was coming from a monster</i>.


<i>I had a coloring book in my lap. I didn't read yet. So there was
this terrible monster singing in the kitchen where my mom was supposed
to be. Footsteps started coming toward the bedroom. I knew
my mom had turned into that terrible monster</i>.


<i>Here's where playing slots comes in. I heard the footsteps, and
all I could think of to do was look down really hard at that page in
the coloring book, and when it didn't make what was happening go
away, turn the page like a little robot and stare down at that page,
and then the next</i>.


<i>I was five, and I had already taught myself to go away from reality
into something I was staring at. Once I could read, I graduated to
books. Once I could date, I got a PhD in my boyfriend's face</i>.


<i>The second training I got in being an addict was having serious
asthma in the 1940s. The doctors didn't know much. So I spent
days, weeks propped up on pillows in bed and making myself take
every single breath. There was not a breath I wasn't aware of</i>.


<i>So I learned how to go away, and I learned how to be compulsive.
Being able to do those two things saved my life as a child. It</i>

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>And I can't think of a better place to hone those two skills perfectly
than sitting on a stool in front of a slot machine screen</i>.


<i>The only comforts in all of this are that now I suspect that gambling
compulsively gave me a place to retreat from crippling anxiety
so that I could stay alive and write, and I've learned that only
through finally getting clean was I able to access the reality of my
mother's illness and my terror. Another comfort of being clean is that
I called my brother, from whom I had felt estranged for years, and he
corroborated what I had realized--and now we are finally true sister
and brother</i>.


I look up. Barb's face is pale. She says, "I had a crazy manic
speed-freak dad. He got better for many years, but now--he has
Alzheimer's, and I'm the only one to take care of him.


"It's my turn next week. I'm glad to go last because now I
don't feel so weird and alone."


We break out more cookies and coffee. I dive in and restore
my electrolyte balance, but even before the sugar kicks in, I am
surprised by how much better I feel.


Barb leads off the next week. She is 41 going on 141. Most
of the time, her eyes are tired, her natural blond hair is pulled
back in a straggly ponytail, and her clothes are basic. "I have six
variations on this stunning outfit," she has told us. "Sweatshirt

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I got dressed up," she says. "This suit's a little back-dated,
but I haven't bought real clothes in ten years. That's what I loved
most about online gambling. Nobody cared what I looked like.
Nobody wanted a damn thing from me but my money. When
they built that casino in Indio Palms and I caught on that my
casual wear was damn near formal compared to everybody else,
I was even happier.


"Here goes:"


<i>I was two weeks pregnant on my graduation night. I was chosen for
the Senior National Honor Society, the DAR Good Citizen Award,
Most Likely to Volunteer Their Brains Out Award (I made that
up), and was 10th in a class of 285. I was Danson, Barbara. My
boyfriend was Davidson, Jon. When we waited in line to go up on the
stage, he whispered to me, "Hey, hot stuff, if they only knew what
we were doing last night."</i>


<i>A girl with a crazy dad is going to go to whatever shelter she can.
Jon's arms were all the haven I had ever dreamed of. Until I was
three months pregnant and he finally caught on</i>.


<i>No way was I going to have an abortion. Not moral reasons,
but my mom had told me horror stories. You know, blood-soaked
mattress, all of that</i>.


<i>So Jon and I got married. I had the kid, then the next two kids.
Then Jon decided he needed to find himself. Ho hum. And I decided
he needed to find himself anywhere but near me</i>.



[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Cut to degree in library science. Cut to working mom. Cut
to working mom who cannot, CANNOT not see when something
isn't fair. You know, once a good citizen, always a good citizen.
So, working as a Bookmobile lady, volunteering as PTA president,
program chairman at my church, Food Bank clerk twice a
month, and warm V cozy home-on-the-block for all the waifs in
the neighborhood</i>.


<i>Cut to I'm messing around on the computer one night, and I
find a place where you can play free online poker. I fool around
for a few months. It eases my mind, relaxes me so I can go to sleep
without Xanax. I get pretty good and think, Hey, why not play
for money?</i>


<i>It goes pretty easy for a while. I keep myself under control, start
in around nine and play till midnight because I have to get up in the
morning to drive the Bookmobile. Then, something happens. More
like, some things happen</i>.


<i>I manage to find time to fall in love with one of my neighbors. He's
recently divorced and homy as I am. I forgot to mention that part about
me. We go at it whenever we can. Sometimes we use protection. Sometimes
not</i>.


<i>One night, as I've just watched the cyber-dealer give me a
straight flush, it dawns on me that I am feeling uncommonly good
for a gal who should be having PMS. Three weeks later, I found out
I was pregnant. Three months later, a stranger calls to tell me that
my father has been found wandering in Trader joe's, insisting that
somebody show him where the naked hula ladies are</i>.


<i>A day later, I am picking my dad up from the emergency ward,
pulling over, locking him in the car, and puking into any bushes that
happen to be alongside the road</i>.



[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The new baby goes colicky, Daddy eludes the adult care worker
every other day, I begin to notice that the book titles in the Bookmobile
have gone blurry, my horny neighbor goes back to his wife--and
I don't care. You all know. The instant those smoked glass casino
doors open and I am in, there is no other shelter I would ever want. I
start dipping into the unusually ample PTA--$12,000 altogether</i>.


<i>How I quit? I got caught</i>.


Sharon begins to laugh. "What's funny?" Barb snaps.


"You," Sharon says, "c'mon, you know how funny you are,
but that's not why I'm laughing. I'm laughing because my husband
and I day-traded for months online, and it never occurred
to me till now to consider it gambling.


"Oh yeah, both of us in our flannel jammies, ice-cold martini
pitcher, maybe a line or two of blow. It was heaven in the privacy
of home."


"It was so easy," Barb says. "I could gamble till my eyeballs
spun. The baby was safe. My dad was zonked out in his room. I
had my diet soda, my pizza, and my double fudge ice cream only
a few feet away in the fridge. It <i>was</i> heaven." She gets that thousand-yard
stare.

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So," I say, "would you have stopped if you hadn't been
caught?"


Barb shakes her head. "I don't know. I'd be lying if I said anything
different. But I did get caught. And, for right now, I haven't
made a bet. That's going to have to be good enough."


I know exactly what she is talking about. And, as close as
anyone can come to feeling another person's emotions, I know
damn well how she feels.


A week or so after we finish our stories, I tell the circle that an
idea has managed to finally make its way through the sludge of my
gambling withdrawal. "Being with all of you has made me realize
that I want to give back what I'm learning. I want to help some
woman who's in as deep shit as I was to know she's not alone--or
going crazy. My withdrawal was so bad I thought I had Alzheimer's.
I couldn't find one scrap of information on the symptoms
of gambling withdrawal--not in books, not online, not from my
counselor at the time. I was terrified.


"I want to write a book about women and compulsive gambling.
I'd like to use us and our stories as the heart of it, include
your autobiographies in your own words--that way the women who
read the book might find pieces of themselves in your stories."


There is a spooky silence. Helen shakes her head. "Not my
stories," she says. "No way I want the other folks in my trailer
park to know what I've been up to."


K-Siu frowns. Barb looks away from me. I look around the
circle and know my brilliant idea might be dying before it even
has a chance to formulate in my mind.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Candace laughs, "I don't give a shit. My life's an open book.
Between my busy booty and how guys talk, everybody in this
town knows Miss Candace's business."


Sharon looks at me. "Maybe you could tell us more. Are you
going to use exactly who we are and what we say?"


I feel my breathing resume. "No. How could I? I'll change
our names. I'll change the place. I'll change everything but my
story..."


"To protect the anything-but-innocent," Candace says.
"Cool."


We talk the rest of the evening. By the time the coffee
and blueberry pie are gone, each woman has agreed to let me
use her words--more than agreed. Candace sums it up for all
of us when she says, "If my story can help one woman before
she gets in over her head-or even after she does--that'll be
enough for me."
