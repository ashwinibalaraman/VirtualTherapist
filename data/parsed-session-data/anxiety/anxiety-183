<font size="4"><b>Chapter 45: Authenticity - Conventionality - and Angst: Existential and Transpersonal Perspectives</b></font>

ROGER WALSH


EXISTENTIAL and transpersonal
disciplines have similar concerns
and much to offer to each other.
Both emphasize a practical focus on those
matters of deepest life importance, especially
the causes and relief of suffering and
what it means to live fully. As such, they pay
particular attention to the fundamental
nature of our human condition, the ways in
which we fall short of our possibilities (especially
through entrapment in social illusion),
the problem of suffering, and how we
can most fully and fundamentally respond
to these issues.


In this chapter, I explore four topics that
are centrally related to these issues:

In the chapter, I do not summarize the existential
and transpersonal movements, nor
do I provide the theoretical, phenomenological,
contemplative, and experimental
data underpinning them. Rather, I simply
enunciate and compare their relevant principles
and refer the reader to reviews of the
two fields (some of the more readable ones
include Barrett, 1958; Cooper, 1990;
Vaughan, 1995a; Walsh, 1993; Walsh &amp;
Vaughan, 1993; Wilber, 1981, 1995, 1996;
and Yalom, 1981).

<b>THE UNSATISFACTORINESS OF OUR
USUAL HUMAN CONDITION</b>


Both traditions recognize a bewildering
ambiguity and unsatisfactoriness at the
heart of everyday life. For Heidegger, we are
"thrown" into a situation of ambiguity and
alienation, which for Jaspers constitutes
"the shipwreck" of our human condition—
homeless in an alien world. There, we confront
"boundary situations" of aloneness,
meaninglessness, responsibility, and death
(Yalom, 1981). Consequently, it is no surprise
that existentialists claim that our
underlying feeling tone is one of angst and
that, as Nietzsche (1968) put it, "as deeply
as man sees into life, he also sees into suffering"
(p. 269).


The transpersonal perspective is in full
agreement with the existentialists in acknowledging
the pervasiveness of ambiguity
and angst, and it suggests that existentialists
have made a profound and accurate
diagnosis of the fundamental feeling tone of
<i>unenlightened</i> existence. In fact, transpersonalists
have much to learn from the sophisticated
accounts that existentialists offer.
The two schools differ, however, in their
views of origins of this unsatisfactoriness.


At the core of the transpersonal movement,
one finds a consistent claim that we
suffer from a case of mistaken identity. We
see ourselves as "skin-encapsulated egos," to
use Alan Watts's somewhat imprecise but picturesque
term. This ego or self-sense is, just as
existentialists have argued, neither given nor
fixed but rather partly chosen and constructed,
not substantial and essential but
rather illusory and (for transpersonalists)
transcendable. Thus, both existentialists and
transpersonalists agree that our usual views
of the self are erroneous and that careful
systematic phenomenology or contemplation
reveal these errors.


The two schools differ, however, in their
understandings about the nature and necessity
of the usual egoic self-sense and about
the deeper nature of identity. Existentialists
tend to assume that "every experience is
‘owned’ in that it can and must be attributed
to an ‘I.’ In Kant's terminology, each
experience is accompanied by an ‘I think’"
(Cooper, 1990, pp. 97-98).


Transpersonalists hold a different view
based on contemplative experiences. They
regard the view that "every experience is
owned" as an example of what Buddhists
call "wrong view." This is a common process
in our usual state of consciousness
where imprecise awareness fails to recognize
the ego constructive process and mistakenly
assumes that there is some self to which experiences
are occurring (Engler, 1993; Epstein,
1995).


With meditative training, however,
awareness becomes more precise and sensitive,
a classic claim now borne out by experimental
testing (Shapiro &amp; Walsh, 1984).
Then the ego constructive processes begin to
be recognized and deconstructed, and the
egoic separate self-sense begins to dissolve
(Goldstein, 1983). A rapid flux of images,
thoughts, and feelings is seen to underlie the
assumption of a continuous ego (just as,
through the process of flicker fusion, a series
of movie frames appears to create continuous
images). This recognition was made
famous in the West by David Hume, who
when looking for his self, could discover
"nothing but a bundle or collection of different
perceptions, which succeed each
other with an inconceivable rapidity and are
in a perpetual flux and movement" (Jones,
1969, p. 305). Likewise, in the East, the
Buddha proclaimed the doctrine of <i>anatta</i>
or no-self (Collins, 1982).


The deeper self-senses that are uncovered
during meditative training and maturation
are said to be increasingly transpersonal,
that is, extending beyond the individual or
personal to encompass wider aspects of
humankind, psyche, and cosmos. The identity

[p. <i>611</i>]

In light of these ideas about our usual
egoic self-sense and our underlying transpersonal
identity, both perennial philosophers
and contemporary transpersonalists
suggest that our usual condition is one of
profound self-alienation (Wilber, 1995).
Not surprisingly, transpersonal theorists
suggest that this self-alienation is central to
understanding our condition and suffering
and that growth and awakening to our
deeper identity can relieve us of much of our
angst, alienation, and Atman project.


<b><i>The Atman Project</i></b>


Much of our individual and collective
self-inflicted suffering, above and beyond
our existential angst, can also be understood
in terms of our mistaken identity and
the unfortunate motives it spawns (Walsh,
1999; Wilber, 1980). We are said to yearn to
recover our true identity, and this yearning
is said to be an expression of the eros of
Plato, the developmental drive to overcome
the alienation of Schelling and Hegel, the
pull of the upper chakras of yoga, and the
meta-motive of self-transcendence described
by Maslow and Wilber.


But when we do not know of our transpersonal
nature, the motive to uncover it
goes unrecognized and unfostered. This
motive then may be denied, distorted, or
pathologized. Consequently, we hurl ourselves
into a desperate search for substitute
gratifications, a search that Wilber (1980)
called the Atman project. This is the hopeless
quest to find full and enduring satisfaction
through the gratification and aggrandizement,
rather than the outgrowth and
transcendence, of our phase-specifically
appropriate, but ultimately stunted and illusory,
self-sense.


The Atman project is a hopeless one since
ultimately we never can get enough of what
we do not really want. Yet billions of lives
and countless cultures are driven—and
driven insane—by it, and the poisoned, polluted,
and plundered earth around us
attests to its insatiable fury. Growth and
awakening to our deeper identity can relieve
us of much of our angst, alienation, and
Atman project, although bottomless mystery
remains, of course.


In summary, both disciplines have profound
concern with, and analyses of, the
limitations and unsatisfactoriness of existence.
Existentialism seems to have provided
an unusually deep account of meaninglessness
and unsatisfactoriness. Both
disciplines regard alienation as central and
see it not simply as a product of cultures or
economics (as do social critics and Marxists)
but rather as a core element of human
existence. However, existentialism and
transpersonalism tend to differ in their
views of human nature and the self, and
hence in their views of self-alienation and
possible and appropriate responses.

[p. <i>612</i>]

<b>THE LIMITATIONS AND SEDUCTION
OF CONVENTIONALITY AND
CONVENTIONAL SLUMBER</b>


Both disciplines recognize and criticize the
limitations of conventional worldviews and
lifestyles. The existential emphasis is on a
critique of unreflective submersion in mass
existence and conventional living—"the
public" of Kierkegaard, "the herd" of
Nietzsche, the "mass existence" of Jaspers,
"the masses" of Ortega, and "the they" of
Heidegger.


The result is that the usual way of living
is regarded as defensive and superficial, a
condition that Fromm referred to as "automation
conformity" and Heidegger called
"everydayness." Everydayness refers to the
tendency to look at things superficially, to
accept conventional views, and to conceal
the truth about ourselves and the world
from ourselves. When this drive to conceal
becomes prepotent, everydayness exacerbates
into full-blown inauthenticity (Zimmerman,
1986).


Transpersonal perspectives agree entirely
with this sober assessment of conventional
lifestyles and societies. However, they tend
to frame this situation, and solutions to it, in
terms of states of consciousness and development.


The usual condition is seen as a conventional
slumber in which development has
proceeded from the preconventional to the
conventional but there has ground to a halt
in what Maslow (1971) called "the
psychopathology of the average." Developmentally,
this conventional condition is
regarded as a form of collective developmental
arrest, with its own stage-specific
and stage-limited characteristics such as a
conventional worldview, social structure,
self-sense, morality, and mores (Walsh &amp;
Vaughan, 1993; Wilber, 1980, 1995).


Although the conventional condition or
stage represents a significant advance over
preconventional magic thinking, it still falls
far short of our transconventional
transpersonal capacities. Therefore, the
conventional condition (and its limitations)
has been labeled in many ways. In the East,
it has been referred to as <i>maya</i>, a dream, and
an illusion (Radhakrishnan, 1929). In the
West, it has been called a consensus trance, a
collective psychosis, a conventional slumber,
a shared hypnosis, and a form of unconsciousness
(Tart, 1986; Walsh &amp; Vaughan,
1993). However, we do not usually recognize
this trance because it is self-masking,
we have been hypnotized since infancy, we
actively defend it, we all share in it, and we
live in the biggest cult of all—culture.


<b><i>The Seduction of Conventionality</i></b>


Both existentialists and transpersonalists
agree that the power of the conventional
majority to control beliefs, attitudes, and
desires is awesome. This power can be brutally
obvious and coercive as in legal, military,
and penal institutions. However, this
power usually is more insidious and seductive.
For most people, the conventional
worldview compels not merely by coercion
but also by seduction, and it is this seductive
attraction that has been most intriguing
and distressing to existentialists and transpersonalists
alike.


Because this seduction by the conventional
majority is so effective, there must
be something in individuals that is strongly
attracted. Obviously, this attraction can
be analyzed at many levels, for example, in
terms of security needs or social belongingness
needs. Not surprisingly, however,
existentialists focus on existential
dynamics as the forces that pressure individuals
to succumb to conventional slumber.

[p. <i>613</i>]

Transpersonalists are in general agreement
with this existential view but again
tend to add a developmental perspective, in
this case coupled with the concept of "coercion
to the biosocial mean." This type of
coercion was identified in personality
research with the finding that people with a
strong genetic tendency to deviation from
the social mean, such as extreme shyness or
assertiveness, tend to be pushed by societal
shaping toward the mean. Transpersonalists
have suggested that a similar dynamic can
occur developmentally such that the average
social level of psychological development
functions like a magnet, pulling individuals
up toward this level but retarding growth
beyond it (Walsh &amp; Vaughan, 1993; Wilber,
1995).


Like developmental theorists in several
other areas (e.g., faith development, moral
development), transpersonalists recognize
three major developmental phases: prepersonal,
personal, and transpersonal (or
preconventional, conventional, and transconventional).
Development up to conventional
levels is expected and nurtured by
society both informally and through formal
educational institutions. On the other hand,
development beyond conventional levels is
an individual matter that can be very threatening
to both the individual and conventional
society.


Development at any level is rarely all
sweetness and light; difficulties exist in all
stages. However, there are extra difficulties
in transconventional development, and they
come from both within and outside of the
individual.


In addition to the usual panoply of
defenses that work to thwart growth at any
stage, there appear to be additional barriers
that swing into play at more advanced
stages. These barriers, defenses, or meta-defenses
have long been recognized in spiritual
traditions as, for example, the seduction
of the <i>siddhis</i> (powers) of yoga or
the pseudo-nirvana of Buddhism. More recently,
Desoille referred to the "repression
of the sublime," and Maslow (1971) described
the "Jonah complex" or the fear of
our potential and greatness. In addition,
people working at these levels must be willing
to relinquish attachments to social
approval and the consensual worldview
because this worldview must be overcome
and social approval for doing so is far from
likely.


Approval and applause are hardly likely
given that transconventional development
threatens conventionality and the consensus
trance. The conventional worldview, illusion,
or maya, together with the values and
lifestyles that both express and perpetuate
it, are called into question. From the perspective
of Becker (1973), this can be seen as
a threat to conventional people's immortality
projects. Not to share a belief system is to
weaken it, and because everyone identifies
with his or her belief system, alternate systems
are experienced as threatening to one's
present (way of) being and future immortality.
Herein lies a source of coercion to the
biosocial mean and suppression of transpersonal
development.


In summary, both existentialism and
transpersonalism share a deep concern
about the limitations and seductiveness of
the usual or conventional worldview, state
of consciousness, and lifestyle. Both see
unreflective surrender to conventionality as

[p. <i>614</i>]

<b><i>Deficiencies of Our
Usual Way of Living</i></b>


Both disciplines acknowledge that our
usual ways of living are deficient and that
this deficiency includes a moral component.


For existentialists, it is not just that we
escape the reality of our individual and
human situation through succumbing to
mass existence and becoming one of the
herd but also that we deliberately deceive
ourselves in and about the process. We
freely choose to succumb but then obliterate
our condition, our freedom, and our choice
from awareness.


Enormous amounts of time and energy—
indeed, whole lifestyles and social collusions
—then go into maintaining our
semiconsciousness. For Kierkegaard (1849/
1954), this is a lifestyle of "Philistinism
[that] tranquilizes itself in the trivial,"
resulting in a state of "shut-upness" and
"half-obscurity" (pp. 174-175). Although
the full panoply of defenses presumably
play their hypnotizing part, it is the twin
tranquilizers of habit and diversion that,
according to Pascal, are particularly potent
and that "are great veils over our existence.
As long as they are securely in place, we
need not consider what life means" (Barrett,
1958, p 135).


The net result is inauthenticity or bad
faith. This is in part the self-deceiving unacknowledged
choice to see ourselves as
choiceless victims who fail to live our lives
open to both our common existential
dilemma and our unique individual situation.
The latter failing seems analogous to
the trap for Indian yogis of failing to recognize
their <i>svabhava</i> (unique character or
nature) and to follow their corresponding
<i>svadharma</i> (unique personal path of practice)
(Aurobindo, 1976).


Transpersonalists are in full agreement
with this existential view, but again they add
a perspective based on development and
states of consciousness. Inauthenticity is
seen as defensive clinging to conventionality
when one could transcend it. Along with
bad faith and other forms of moral immaturity,
it can be viewed as expressing, stabilizing,
and reinforcing our usual distorted consensus
trance. For example, unreflective
busyness and habits can be seen as forms of
"loading stabilization," a process in which a
state of consciousness is stabilized and
maintained by loading it with input and
activity (Tart, 1983).


<b>STRATEGIES AND RESPONSES</b>


Given all of this—our moral immaturities,
our deficient ways of living, the limitations
and seductive power of conventionality, the
unsatisfactoriness and groundlessness of
existence—how are we to respond? Both
disciplines agree in emphasizing the importance
of detribalization and moral heroism,
practices that might be essential for any significant
degree of psychological maturity.


Detribalization is the process by which
we escape from some of the distorting, constricted,
and erroneous beliefs of our cultural
worldview (Levinson, 1978). Through
detribalization, we are able to step back
from these beliefs so that we no longer look
through and identify with them. Rather, we
begin to look at them and, in looking at
them, to disidentify from them. In disidentifying
from them, we are able to work
to transform both them and ourselves.


For existentialists, the central moral recommendation
—in fact, perhaps the central
recommendation of all existentialism—is
the adoption of a heroic attitude (Yalom,

[p. <i>615</i>]

These attitudes suggest a decidedly willful
and actively heroic stance. Yet, the
mature Heidegger hinted at something beyond
resoluteness—something less willful,
more allowing, and more Taoistic. He called
this attitude or way of being "releasement"
and described it as standing open to being
(Zimmerman, 1986).


Of course, significant parts of Heidegger's
thinking seem to include decidedly
mystical elements, as is the case with
Husserl, the founder of phenomenology
(Caputo, 1978; Zimmerman, 1986). Hanna
(1993a, 1993b) suggested that this inclination
is a natural consequence of profound
phenomenological inquiry and that when
this method is practiced rigorously and
deeply, it will naturally merge into a type of
contemplation and begin to yield mystical
insights. Careful exploration of the relationship
between phenomenology and contemplation/meditation
could be very valuable
and might open a methodological bridge
between existential and transpersonal
domains. Clearly, one of the major deficiencies
of Western (as opposed to Eastern) philosophy,
religion, and psychology has been
the lack of a readily available and effective
introspective/contemplative discipline.


Although existentialists emphasize a type
of moral heroism, it is a far cry from conventional
ideas of morality, so much so that
there has been debate over whether existentialism
can offer any ethical guidelines or
moral philosophy (Cooper, 1990). Consider,
for example, Kierkegaard's argument for
"suspending the ethical" and Nietzsche's
"overman," who supposedly was "beyond
good and evil."


Yet, the existential arguments make perfect
sense from a developmental perspective.
The existentialists seem to be arguing for a
transconventional morality that goes
beyond or transcends conventional views of
good and evil, as transconventional morality
indeed does (Kohlberg, 1981). Such
morality seems to be a means to, as well as
an expression of, individual transconventional
development.


However, it is primarily an emphasis on
<i>individual</i> transconventional development.
There is some discussion of reciprocal freedom,
acknowledging that the quest for freedom
and authenticity requires collaboration
and "intersubjective solidarity" (Sartre) in
which one "frees the other" (Heidegger).
However, there is also Nietzsche's idea
that "free spirits" need and "live off" the opposition
of the herd (Cooper, 1990). Hence,
there is little discussion of the establishment
of a transconventional community (or
<i>sangha</i>) or of transpersonal emotions and
motives such as encompassing love and compassion.
This emphasis on the individual
transcender beyond good and evil seems to
be one reason why some existentialists have
been susceptible to charges of elitism.


A developmental transpersonal perspective,
therefore, seems to throw new light on
existential ethics (Walsh, 1999). Transpersonalists
agree with the necessity for a
form of transconventional moral heroism
and approve the Buddha's call for a stringent
communal ethical life "beyond good
and beyond evil" (Byrom, 1976, p. 100). In
contemporary developmental terms, the
goal is maturation beyond conventional
dualism toward Kohlberg's (1981) highest
stage (Stage 7), in which morality is
grounded in direct unitive experience where

[p. <i>616</i>]

Transpersonalists, however, tend to see
ethics as but one component of a multipronged
discipline designed to foster development
to transpersonal/transconventional
stages and corresponding states of consciousness.
Their language tends to include
not only heroic metaphors but also metaphors
such as opening, unfolding, awakening,
liberation, and enlightenment (Metzner,
1998; Walsh, 1999). It also tends to acknowledge
the importance of both communal
and individual development (Vaughan,
1995b; Wilber, 1995, 1996).


The preeminent developmental theorist
within the transpersonal field has been
Wilber (1980, 1995, 1996). He has employed
developmental structuralism to compare
contemplative traditions across centuries
and cultures and has identified six
developmental stages beyond the conventional
one. Wilber specifically has identified
the second of these transconventional stages
with the existential perspective and
worldview, and he has suggested that existential
psychologists may have plumbed aspects
of the human condition more deeply
than nearly all other Western schools. He
has described four further stages and corresponding
perspectives beyond the existential
one. Not surprisingly, these are increasingly
difficult to attain and rarely are
realized without the aid of some type of intensive
contemplative discipline.


Cross-cultural examination of authentic
spiritual disciplines suggests that although
they may contain enormous amounts of
peculiar cultural baggage, they also may
contain common effective processes and
practices. To date, seven common elements
have been suggested: ethical behavior,
attentional stabilization, emotional transformation,
perceptual refinement, redirection
of motivation, cultivation of wisdom,
and service (Walsh, 1999). Almost invariably,
authentic disciplines (i.e., disciplines
capable of effecting significant transpersonal
development) include contemplative
or meditative training. This might seem at
odds with Heidegger's (1982) warning
against "extravagant grubbing about in
one's soul" (p 160), but introspection can
involve either obsessive rumination or disciplines
of mental development, and the two
are light years apart.


These claims for the existence of
transpersonal stages and potentials beyond
the conventional obviously are of enormous
significance. But the obvious question remains:
Are they true? Are transpersonal
experiences, stages, and capacities valid and
valuable potentials within us all? Or, as critics
(including some existentialists) have suggested,
are they merely the products of
pathological, regressed, or deluded minds
engaged in desperate defensive maneuvers
to avoid the harsh realities of mortality and
meaninglessness? A considerable body of
theory and research now supports some
claims for the value and validity of transpersonal
experiences and potentials (Laughlin,
McManus, &amp; d'Aquili, 1992; Shapiro &amp;
Walsh, 1984; Walsh, 1993; Walsh &amp; Vaughan,
1993; Wilber, 1980, 1995, 1996).


In this arena, however, just as important
as laboratory findings and elaborate theories
is direct experience. For thousands of
years, the great wisdom traditions have
argued that the best way in which to assess
such claims is to test them oneself through
exploring and cultivating one's own mind.
On this, existentialists and transpersonalists
are in agreement; the most profound and
important answers are to be found in one's
own life and experience.


<b>COMMENTS AND
COMPARISONS</b>


In his reply, Schneider provides thoughtful
comments on some of the ideas expressed in

[p. <i>617</i>]

<b><i>Questions</i></b>


First, to some of the questions. Schneider
suggests that transpersonalists critique
existentialists erroneously for "being short-sighted
about our conscious potential and
for being unwarrantedly anxious as a
result ... and for being gloomy and unenlightened."
Actually, there is mighty little
true enlightenment in either existential or
transpersonal circles, and several transpersonalists
(myself included) have expressed
admiration for the existential openness
to the anxiety and dread that an
unwavering look at our human condition
generates (e.g., Wilber, 1980). The two
groups do indeed differ in their estimation
of our conscious potential. As mentioned
earlier, some transpersonal claims regarding
this potential are now supported by
research findings, but the most important
testing might come from exploring and cultivating
one's own mind.


Schneider warns transpersonalists against
underestimating and undervaluing "the
unfathomability of our condition, awe, and
amazement." But the discovery, and even
the realization, of transpersonal potentials
does not necessarily diminish awe, amazement,
and radical mystery. It might even
sharpen them because, as Lao Tzu observed,

<i>From wonder into wonder</i>


<i>Existence opens</i>. (Bynner, 1944/1980,
p 25)


<b><i>Agreements</i></b>


Schneider's central theme is a cry for
humility, that is, intellectual and existential
humility and awe in the face of the unfathomable
infinity and mystery of the universe.
Who could not agree?


Schneider also prudently warns against
claims for ultimacy. Although I am not sure
that one can say that ultimate claims <i>never</i>
should be made—that would itself be an
ultimate claim—Schneider's warning is well
taken. Existentialists probably have done
better here than have transpersonalists.


Schneider correctly points out the danger
of members of one school claiming to fully
comprehend another school. In my experience,
many examples of internecine psychological
warfare actually reflect attacks on
<i>misunderstandings</i> of other schools. All of
us would benefit from deeper study of other
perspectives and from becoming skilled in
their epistemological methods. Both schools
draw on scientific methods and studies
where these are appropriate and available,
although both are wary of the risks and distortions
of scientism, that is, the pseudo-philosophy
that holds that science is the
best, or even the only, way in which to
acquire valid knowledge. The appropriate
response to scientism is, "Show us your scientific
proof that science is the best or the
only way in which to acquire valid knowledge."
To this request, there can only be
stunned silence.


Many of the differences between the
worldviews of existentialists and transpersonalists
reflect the divergent effects of their
different epistemological methods. For existentialists,
the central methods probably
are philosophical and psychological
reflections: what Saint Bonaventure and
(more recently) Wilber have called the "eye
of reason." Whereas transpersonalists
employ the eye of reason, they also rely on
insights provided by meditative and contemplative
practices—the "eye of contemplation"
(Wilber, 1990). These different
epistemologies may underlie many of the
existential-transpersonal intellectual differences,

[p. <i>618</i>]

Both existentialists and transpersonalists,
therefore, may benefit from a fuller
practice of both epistemological methods.
The result may be a more comprehensive,
more adequate, and more satisfying understanding
of ourselves and our place in the
universe as well as a greater convergence between
