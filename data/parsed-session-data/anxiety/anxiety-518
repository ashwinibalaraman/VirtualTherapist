BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you.  You can, uh, keep the information about—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	That's great.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.  Thank you.  Okay.  How have you been doing?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, okay.  I've, I'm in the midst of making a lot of, um, decisions that I, you know, I wanted to come up, I wanted to come up with a plan with you.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I feel like I'm in a, um, I'm, I'm really in a quandary about making some decisions and I think I just need, I think I need to make some informed decisions and then go from there and it has to do with me going back to work.
<b>DR:</b>	Good idea.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and I'm just, I'll just explain a little bit about what, what, um, I'm kind of feeling.  It's, it's all very just, I'm just so torn about some of these things.  I really—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Think I need something other than kids all day.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I just, I do.  And you and I have talked about that before.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I am just, it's just so much, just being with them all day everyday and, you know, they're so little like I'm still nursing [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So it's not just the waking hours.  The sleeping hours too—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's just, there's no break and, um, I'm, I feel like I'm not, I feel like I'm just, I just feel like I'm not benefiting myself and I don't feel like I'm benefiting them.  Like I feel like I'm falling, I'm feeling like a failure as a mom and I, and I'm not sure what, um, I'm not sure exactly how the, uh, uh, I don't know, how to be the best mom that I can be; get rid of the olds ideas of what I thought a good mom was; dream about the new ideas about what a good mom is; and do all that without really paying attention to what anyone else says because to be honest with you, I'm getting some approval and some not approval.  So you can please all the people all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	So I just, um, uh, I'll just give you an example.  Like I'm just like sad to rule out the, I get sad a lot and—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I just, I'm just way out from being a mom and, um, I have to relax because I'm, I'm, I'm still very cognizant that I'm being recorded and I, I just need to—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, we can turn it off.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You don't have to do it.
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, it's just, no, I don't mind it all, it's just not flowing naturally and I need to just step back—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And think about how, um, how, not how to do it, but just to tell you how normally, um, and not that I was all variant in any way.  Just that I need to get in touch with my heart and I think I'm still thinking about moving forward too.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, well, you're doing a great job expressing yourself, but that's secondary.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, no, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean we can shut that off.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not any big deal at all.
<b>PT:</b>	I need to reach in and just tell you like exactly how I'm feeling and I, maybe it's just that I have so much to tell you that I can't really put it all together.  So I'm just going to keep talking—
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	So that we can just pull out the, whatever the [INAUDIBLE] is.  Um, okay, so I'm at home every day with the kids and I'm not happy doing every day with the kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just not.  Um, and my son, [NAME OTHER], needs, seems to need some stimulation other than me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Now where, so, so the next step would be maybe he needs to do something else.  So my natural thought was to go back to work so I'd have something to do and he could be with other kids and he'd have, he'd had, would have other involvement and maybe even like just the idea of having someone other than myself that is a caregiver.  Like I think that's good that he, there's someone else that he could trust—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Besides mom and dad.  Now saying all of that, I'm cutting back to why can't I stay home.  Like so if this was 1,000 years ago, this wouldn't even be an issue for me.  Like I would just be with the children all the time and that would be that and I know this sounds funny, but I keep going back to, how are we biologically wired and I keep going back to, um, I keep thinking that the, that not the evolved human, but the woman at her basic, natural self should, should be able to stay home with her kids, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	I think 1,000 years ago what you tended to have was a group of people all together, you know, working together in terms of survival for the community and what I visualize is maybe more native American.  You know, there's a woman grinding the corn; there's another one, uh, you know, out in the fields with possibly a baby slung over their shoulder; you know, possibly—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Another as soon as they could work, I'm sure the small children started doing what they could do as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So there wasn't the isolation of a single parent and 1 or 2 small children.  You had this whole vast array of different ages, experience.  What I also visualize in this community of 1,000 years ago, you know, when a woman was very pregnant, probably then she would shift to doing different kinds of work that might keep her closer to the aid of other people and not, you know, off in the most distance field or doing very strenuous work and vice versa.  So it was fluid, it adjusted for the person's physical state and perhaps the support that, that they could get from others, but that's, that's what I imagine.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And the people who may have been solitary, more solitary, uh, probably by biological endowment, might have been, you know, the best hunters, probably male.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Probably very agile.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, you know, not weighed down by pregnancy from time to time.  You know, able to be swift and perhaps, uh, uh, self—sufficient.  So it, the, the solo individual who's going to doubt, it's probably more likely to be certainly men.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Certainly not all men.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sure the old men were put back to work in the fields or, you know, sorting corn husks or whatever they were able to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So I'm sure—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, that's it—
<b>DR:</b>	Everybody had jobs and interacted and the environment had some give and take in terms of what their needs and abilities were at the time.
<b>PT:</b>	That's the huge thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	The isolation.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	That's like, like that's, that's the biggest like [INAUDIBLE] I mean I, I felt that I wouldn't be able, I, I have not, felt like I haven't been able to cry a lot and I was going to talk to you about medication, but actually I think I need to keep my meds where they are right now, but, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because we lowered the Prozac last time, didn't we?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's at, it's at 50 mg—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Which I feel good.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel, I feel like I'm expressing myself; I'm not a complete mess; but I, that's actually has, that's probably the first time in a while that I'm, I'm kind of tearing up, but—
<b>DR:</b>	And you need that outlet.  That's why we have it, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and, and I'm, I'm still, I'm so like lonely during the day and, um, I look at my kids and I that that I just don't want to screw them up, you know, and, and so here comes the next, sort of the next thing which is the first thing is that I'm isolated—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And I know that there's something that needs to be done about that.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's the first thing, but the second thing is and maybe I'm saying but in there because I feel like it negates the first thing, but is that my, my mom was like, um, very depressed with, she had bipolar and she, she had the version where it was the depression that took precedence over, over really any sorts of mania that, the mania was just sort of periodic [INAUDIBLE] really.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Kind of like the hypomanic.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Bipolar too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	The, yeah, is that what it is?  Bipolar [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and she responded really well with Lithium.  Now she had that when I was, and I was [AGE] when her, her, um, her symptoms really came alive and, and funny I'm saying they came alive because her symptoms were [INAUDIBLE] from me [INAUDIBLE] and, and, you know, like I had a lot of things going on when I was [AGE], um, was that, uh, I was going to start school the next year; mom went into an illness; and my middle sister was born.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So it was a lot, and I've kind of gotten through all that, but I look back and for the first half of kindergarten, I was okay.  I wasn't missing mommy; I wasn't scared or anything like that; it was the second half—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And it was about that time where my sister was about to be born; my sister's born in May.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, my mom said—through my kindergarten year she started to withdraw.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	She told me that when she was walking me to kindergarten one day she said she was thinking to herself, I just cannot give how much you need.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Said I can't do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, and [INAUDIBLE] started to develop this intense fear that I was going to have a heart attack and I could feel like, I, I felt like I was going to die.
<b>DR:</b>	When you were young?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When you were [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b>	When I was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like I really thought I was going to die [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Did you know someone who had had a heart attack?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my sis, it's actually interesting and I don't even know that at [AGE] you're capable of, of [INAUDIBLE] things as being signs, but my mom was away one day at a funeral—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Which was my first introduction to a funeral.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And I choked.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	And, so she was away and I choked and I, I guess I had this awareness of death which is where she was and I—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I remembered the, the uncle was my father's, [NAME OTHER], who died and so from that point forward, I was intensively afraid that I was going to have a heart attack and they would get the stethoscope out and [INAUDIBLE] would get the stethoscope out so I could listen to my heart—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't know if I was having panic at, attacks.  I definitely thought I was going to die.
<b>DR:</b>	It was very likely it was a panic attack.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When you choked, how did you stop choking?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my grandmother was there—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And she was, she was like, and, and when I say I choked, I meant that I think water went down the wrong pipe or some piece of peanut butter and jelly went, you know, I—
<b>DR:</b>	You felt like you couldn't breathe.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I couldn't breathe, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that was scary.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and that was scary, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Did she do the Heimlich or—
<b>PT:</b>	No, it—
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Like in other words it wasn't that severe.
<b>DR:</b>	She helped you through it.
<b>PT:</b>	She just gave me a glass of water and said—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Drink the water.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	And, you know, it, I, that was, that was kind of like incidental too, but I guess everything else, mommy being away when that incident happened.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And then everything else.  So why I'm, I'm bringing all of this up is because when I look back at that point the, the terms of my life I was like very lonely and even before all that when I would be at home with my mom, I was all by myself.  Now I'm not sure if I felt lonely because I was, because of it being a normal like initial awareness that sometimes you're going to feel lonely when you're all by yourself, like if it was just a natural, or if it was the beginnings of my mom's illness and she was away and I was scared.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But the bottom line is that I don't want that for my children and I'm trying to make the best decision for them.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	So how do I make the best decision?  Like I'm not, my thought was, well, if I'm home with them all of the time and I'm giving them myself completely, then that's the best scenario.  But now that I'm [INAUDIBLE] at home all the time—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm not giving all of myself.  I'm like worn out and, um, you know, I was reading something that it's, it said something to the degree of you'll feel better to look after your children, love your children, hug your children during the day, but you yourself.  And you know what, I'm not sure that that's true.
<b>DR:</b>	You'll find as many differences of opinion as places—
<b>PT:</b>	All the time.
<b>DR:</b>	You care to look.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That's right and, and, and you'll find as many, and I actually went on the internet to find like what are some studies that have shown the impacts of children being away from their moms or, and what that is and I'm trying to like, and all of this to say is that I am so intensely trying to control what the outcome is—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm so scared to make a move because it, it's going to be [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I really don't want to cut my kids.  I do not want to screw them up.  Like I, and I, and then I'm like if they go somewhere and I'm not, I'm not even talking fulltime.  I'm talking part time.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Like, but I'm like, so, so I'm like, okay, and then when they go, maybe the impact of them going isn't going to be the, them going.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's going to be my response to how they go and my response to, um, you know, what their day is and my response to my own feelings and, and feelings of guilt and how that comes back and how I'm expressing it to them during the day, you know what I mean?  So I'm like, I'm trying to cover all my bases and I'm driving myself crazy.  So I got in contact with [DEIDENTIFIED].  I like [DEIDENTIFIED] a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	They've been a good employer.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm, I, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I like the work there.  I like, I like using my brain for something that's usually like a guide thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like investments and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	And you're good at it too.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm good at it, yeah.  Um, and I touched base with 6 or 7 people there and I, I, I just reached out.  I called them on the phone.
<b>DR:</b>	Nice.
<b>PT:</b>	I left them each a message—
<b>DR:</b>	Got you.
<b>PT:</b>	And I said, you know, I'm, I'm really, um, interested in coming back to work part time.  You are someone I feel comfortable reaching out to—
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	And, if, you know, if you can just give me a call back to let me know if you know of any opportunities or if you'd be willing to sort of, so I left this message.  Everyone got back to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	They were all really nice.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good sign.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So, so I got a few, a few bites.  Um, and this one opportunity came back and let me just step back to say that what I would love to work would be like, um, Monday, Tuesday, and then maybe half day Thursday.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	So Monday and Tuesday full days—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Half a day Thursday and then be off Wednesday and Friday.  So that was kind of my, so they came back with something that was not exactly what I wanted.  It, it's Monday through Friday 8:30 to 1:30.  So it's exciting, but I'm not sure if it's what I want and let me just also step back and say that I thought that, um, I thought that the ideal situation would be for me to pick out a schedule that I would feel comfortable with and then find a job that matches that instead of finding a job and forcing my comfortability on the job's hours.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So because it doesn't have the hours, I'm, I'm kind of like, hmm, would that work?  But it might.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's the part that kind of excites me—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	But also kind of scares me because technically if I were to, and I'm thinking I would probably find a place near work, um, where I would drop them off at 8:00 and pick them up at 2:00.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, but it would be 8:00 to 2:00 every day—
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And that makes me a little uneasy and I'm scared and so, so this is all that I'm dealing with and that's it.  So now I'm going to just step back and [INAUDIBLE].  I unloaded.
<b>DR:</b>	Good job.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think you're doing a great job looking at all sides of the issue here.  And in terms of time with your children, it's all about quality or quantity.  Quality trumps quantity every time.
<b>PT:</b>	Does it?
<b>DR:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] any study you'll ever see is going to say differently.  Um, you know some families where maybe one parent has to travel a lot for their job, but if they're, they're having a good time with their kids, even if it's only a few hours a week, that's what's going to stay with the kid and their memory—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And enrich their life.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You want to be the best person you can be when you're with them.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And I know from experience, it's, it's very had to be there 24/7 'cause maybe, you know, if you had the time to yourself, you might like to read a book, there might be a variety of things you'd like to do.  You don't get to have an uninterrupted stretch of time even to think.
<b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b>	The interruptions are difficult to predict, you know they always take precedent,  and that's why people have such a hard time working from home.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And it is very difficult to do.
<b>PT:</b>	I've read a study if I can interject here—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I really thought about working from home that they did a study on children, um, like the impact of children's fee, like the emotional neglect or whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Working moms, stay—at—home moms, working—from—home moms—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And it was the working—from—home mom's children who had the toughest time—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Because the mom was so distracted by—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	It was really incredible.  So any way—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because you can imagine—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, to a small child, mommy's there, but mommy's on a conference call.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And a small child, that's what I'm saying, hang on and in a half an hour—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'll be with you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All they know is they have a need and there's their mom right in front of them and she's not meeting it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what they remember and that's a hard thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You can't please anybody with that.  Some, um, attractive aspects of the option that you've been offered are a routine.  A routine for you and a routine for them.
<b>PT:</b>	I thought that too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I thought they know every day at 8 o'clock they're going to go and, and see [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	And the school year's going to be here before you know it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that schedule fits fantastically well with the school year—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Also.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, if you can find an arrangement where you might be able to stop in and see them during the day even—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, if you get a break at some point, you know, just to touch base and see how things are going—
<b>PT:</b>	Well—
<b>DR:</b>	You might feel better.
<b>PT:</b>	The other thing that I was looking at is like what are the things that you look for in a daycare and one of them was to be able to say what's your drop—in policy and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If they say you can't just drop in, then the hell with them, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they might say certain times are better than others and—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You can work with that because maybe there's a situation where they need to have—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of structure, but, um—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I actually think that could be very workable if you like the nature of the work.  Again, quality—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, are they offering you something that you like to do?
<b>PT:</b>	I've done it before.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm very good at it.  It's, it's a phone job—
<b>DR:</b>	That's fabulous.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's, it's a phone job that I, I'm going to ask for I think between $20 and $22 an hour.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, because, I know they probably start at $16 or $17, but I know the job, I trained those people.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Half the people that are working in that department, I trained them on it.
<b>DR:</b>	You have experience.
<b>PT:</b>	I have experience, so I am worth that money.
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I could probably walk in and just do the job without the training although they'll probably require me to do the training.  So, so I'm scared and I'm scared to make this decision and I'm not sure.  So let me just step back to say that there are a few things that are holding me back from making this decision.  One is I don't know if it's too many days, if it is the Monday through Friday, although the routine I can definitely argue.  And then the other thing is that [NAME OTHER] will be, he's [AGE] months; he'll be [AGE] months and he'll be just entering that whole weird, um, stranger anxiety phase, not necessarily right then, but after that and also that I, I, and I'll miss him a lot during the day and then, um, [NAME OTHER] has never known anything but me and I'm actually worrying more about [NAME OTHER] because it would be such a sudden transition for him and so, um, I'm worried about the number of days and I'm worried about transitioning him and so that's it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, when you were small, did you have a lot of play dates with friends?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	And how about, does [NAME OTHER] have play dates with friends?
<b>PT:</b>	He, he does, I mean it's mostly with me because to be honest with you, like, well, I think we're going to have a play date tomorrow with—
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, I work them in there—
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's, it's maybe once every 2 weeks I'd say on average that's probably a play date.
<b>DR:</b>	That's pretty good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That is something he can look forward to and just thinking back to how depressed your mother was and when someone feels incredibly depressed, they don't even want to pick up the phone—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And arrange a play date and—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a part of her that was saying to herself, I can't give her what she needs—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And I don't even have the ability to pull it together and, you know, reach out to other people with children their age and so forth whereas you are doing that reaching out—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think when you said, you said earlier, you said I feel like a failure as a mother and, of course, I see you as anything but—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But the fact that it's crossed your mind, wait a minute, maybe I am not able to give them everything they need just by the 3 of us staying home all the time.  That may echo back to your mother's thought to herself, but the situation's very different.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know it is, I just, um, so like, I guess I have some decisions that I need to make and I, you know what, I don't, now I don't know what to do and I know that you cannot tell me.  What I guess I need help with is maybe a process of—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Making that decision.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm looking at the 8:30 to 1:30 and I think that comes out to 25 hours a week, right?
<b>PT:</b>	It does.
<b>DR:</b>	Advantages in the business world are if you have an overall game plan to have some amount of time in the office every day, you have some flexibility, you know, you can respond to things immediately that need to be responded to, you can postpone until tomorrow and there aren't large chunks of time where, um, things might go by the wayside or not have the follow—up that they need.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I was thinking about your original Monday and Tuesday and half a day on Thursday.  That could put a lot of pressure to get things done on Thursday.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	I could see that Thursday turning into more than half a day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Just trying to—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Comp, uh, any backlog.  My other thought is, with the 25 hours a week, it's a nice number.  If one of the children is sick and you need to be home, you can probably redistribute that work to other days, you know, and still be able to do the 25 hours, but you may need to be out for a couple days in a row or—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Whatever and you have the flexibility to do that.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I guess they, they—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I get 8 days off.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's excellent too.
<b>PT:</b>	So if I call out—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I still get paid for it.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and they have it, I think it's 15 days that I get—
<b>DR:</b>	Excellent.
<b>PT:</b>	Combination vacation/sick.  So you take them however you want to take them—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But—
<b>DR:</b>	That's pretty family—friendly of them.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, it is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, um—
<b>DR:</b>	The routine would be a good thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm also thinking about, um, my kids and their experience with camp.  They loved to camp far more than we imagined that they would and, um, looking at finances, you know, there are questions of either going for the full summer for 7 weeks or 4 weeks.  If they went for 4 weeks, they'd feel like they're really missing out—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?  Oh, they're planning on doing such and such, you know, at the end of the summer and we're not going to be there.  Uh, so we figured out a way to make it happen for 7 weeks next summer too.  Um, but I'm thinking about with the, um, daycare situation.  On the days they're home, they might feel like they're missing out—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they  might.
<b>DR:</b>	On something going on there because—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	There are events—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And such.  They love being with you, there's no question about that.
<b>PT:</b>	They do.
<b>DR:</b>	But there's also going to be, I think they can like both frankly.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you?
<b>DR:</b>	And there may be, you know, oh, I'm having fun there.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think from like 1:30—
<b>DR:</b>	I don't know.
<b>PT:</b>	Like that would be just after lunch, but before all the kids get home from school.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like that would be, I figure I would be home at 2:15 everyday with them.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so nice.
<b>PT:</b>	We could play in the afternoon and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Hang out and—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	There's a lot to be said for that too because as the day goes on, they're more tired; you know, you're more tired; you're not playing in traffic in the afternoon; and it's a natural time to relax a bit more—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.
<b>DR:</b>	I think.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It definitely is, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	As opposed to if you'd tried to just take them there in the afternoons, it may be a little harder to, to get with the swing of things with that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I, I, it's not too close to dinnertime.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My husband doesn't get home until 6:30.  So I'd have that window to just—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Be with them and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So now I don't know if the play date because I, I, my, my heart was kind of going in that direction, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just, one of the things that, um, I think I, I learned like growing up and I guess maybe we'll need to talk about this more is that I, I tend to operate, um, not, [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  He says that we sort of have 2, 2 ways we operate.  Either you operate in a pursuit of something really interesting/exciting or you operate in avoidance of, of something.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh—
<b>PT:</b>	It's the fear.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm definitely the fear—based kind of person.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't want to operate like that.  I want it to be, I want to look at it from the positive, positive, positive—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think that you are.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't, I can't listen to what other people, because everyone has an opinion.  Like my mom, you know, who I initially felt was going to be so supportive said to me, she said, what are you going to do like 12 hours a week?  And I was like, no, mom; I'm going to do like 20 or 25.  So, so, um—
<b>DR:</b>	She's coming from a completely different perspective.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's just funny.  So, um, yeah, so I guess I just need to make that decision.  I feel like I'm leaning towards that.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	It's a nice opportunity.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it is.  Um, so I'm just scared.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  I think you're doing a good job—
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Looking at, at all the sides of it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And I do think that routine will help and, yeah, I mean, you will find so many different people with so many different opinions.  None of them has to walk in your shoes—
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	In your shoes.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	None of them has your exact biology; none of them has your exact background.
<b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b>	It's all about quality.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And we know so many tragic stories about abused children and alcoholic parents and lack of supervision and it's just so tragic.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you know what [INAUDIBLE], 'cause I have very, I have very, uh, heavy lines of alcoholism in my family.  It is, it is very incredible and especially on, it is on my father's side and my father was the alcoholic in my family, but my mother's side, I had, I was one of 22 grandchildren—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I, half of them I would say were full—fledged alcoholics.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Two of them are my siblings.  Two of them are and, and I don't, this is I guess saying something for my mom and dad, they both, my 2 siblings also happen to be the only 2 in recovery—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because there was just such a, they [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know, I guess maybe although we were closed in discussing our feelings, there was something about how my mom and dad handled that that, that made them feel like they could, they could be like become an alcoholic.  You know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I don't, I don't know what exactly it was—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But, but, yeah, and maybe I'm putting too much, uh, giving too much credit to my parents because they are both wonderful individuals who made the decision to, I guess it was right for them, you know, to, not right for them.  I guess it was, it was hard, but I, I guess it was, um, I don't want to say it was easy for them, but it was, for them it was the only thing they could do is to stop drinking—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	And, of course, your mother has shared certainly of her experiences and thoughts with you and then you have the judgment to do what you need to do with that information.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Like how she felt the time that she was taking you to kindergarten.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  I know.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, and very sweet and I think that she just probably didn't feel like she had very many options or the illness was starting to get the upper hand—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're having that [INAUDIBLE] as a task—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?  Rather than spend a long time sad and unfulfilled—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	At home and, you know, kids always pick up on how someone's feeling—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and yet they're also really resilient and understanding too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	There may be a part of them that feels like oh, I should really cheer mom up.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's fascinating to [INAUDIBLE] with [NAME OTHER] or there's another comedian, uh, who was I reading about?  They became comedians, oh, [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	To try to cheer their terribly depressed parents.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER]'s mother I think was very depressed and an alcoholic and he would try to wake her up from a drunken stupor, you know, with a funny routine and he—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Would feel like, you know, my day was a success—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I got her to wake up and laugh once.  So you can imagine—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and she was home 24/7.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Was that, that's [INAUDIBLE] the best thing at that point in their lives, maybe not.  You'd like that little boy to have a play date—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Or, you know, some, some kind of a change from that—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Routine—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, and with the situation that you're looking at, it seems like in many ways, you could have the best of both worlds.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  Well, my other thought was that I can try it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If it doesn't work—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	I could get out.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It gives you a chance to establish a track record there and then, you know, perhaps, um, if it does seem hard to do those 5 consecutive days, you can say, you know, I really think I could swing this 25 hours to over 4 days.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Or 3 1/2.  I mean there's a—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Huge amount of—
<b>PT:</b>	That's true.
<b>DR:</b>	Flexibility with 25 hours which is—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's true.
<b>DR:</b>	Really nice.  But when we start to get more into the school routine, that I feel—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean many parents would just be thrilled to be able to just plan to work during school hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And the kids are doing their own thing anyway.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, they are.  And I'm so good at this one job.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I'm like, and I just—
<b>DR:</b>	It's fantastic there's an opening.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I, I, I had just touched base and my sister actually used to work in the department.  She moved to North Carolina.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.  I knew that was coming up.
<b>PT:</b>	And the position opened up and she's—
<b>DR:</b>	This is serendipity.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think?
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] because you know what, I've been having a lot of serendipitous things happening to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So it's just, now my, there was another position opened that I was like I don't think it'll pay enough for me.  It was $17, $6, $6, actually I thought it was $13 an hour.  So I, I referred to my sister to the job.  She got the job—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And she said that would be so great if I could have off Wednesdays.  Well, her schedule is Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	She was off on Wednesday.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.  Well, you might be able to arrange that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, I might—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Be able to.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So, so it's kind of like I don't know.  Now I'm just scared.  I'm, I'm scared.  Uh, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	So, but I would, I would, I would really like to try it out.  I would really like to try it out.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	What's your husband's response?
<b>PT:</b>	Totally supportive.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	Like awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	He's the main person whose opinion matters.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, and—
<b>DR:</b>	Because you're, you know, you're managing the family together.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and he's—
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	Just awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He says, you, you would love my husband.  He's just wonderful.  So, you know, [INAUDIBLE], but yeah, he's really, yeah, he's really great.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that sounds exciting.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it does.
<b>DR:</b>	I think it could be a very good thing—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All around.  And like you say, it doesn't have to be irrevocable, but you can give it a try.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, and—
<b>PT:</b>	That's the thing that gives me the most comfort.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean it's not like I'm locked into it and we don't, we don't, um, like live outside of our means.  Like we have 2 cars that are paid off and we have a small house and if we had to make it on 1, on 1 income which we've been doing, we could make it work.  It's just very, very tight all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Awesome.
<b>PT:</b>	So, um, so that's good.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, it's not as fulfilling as it could be maybe all around.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean it's not just loyalty.  You know, you, you and your children love your time with each other, but you like to do other things too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	And maybe some day down the road if you have that Wednesday off, they can still be in their program—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And you have a few hours to do what you need or want to do.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's right.  That's true.
<b>DR:</b>	That could work.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I, I guess maybe one, one of the reasons why I was [INAUDIBLE], oh, I would really love to do that, would, have a Wednesday just to do that like [DEIDENTIFIED] trip or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Whatever, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like, but the other thing about this job and I've always been like, like [INAUDIBLE] it's too damn cold to be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And the job starts [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So it would be, I thought it would be a couple of months for me to research definitely, different daycares and maybe even—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If I find one that I like [INAUDIBLE] or that I'm, I'm like, you know, this is something that could really work, um, I could maybe start bringing them like a couple of days a week—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.  That's a great—
<b>PT:</b>	You know?
<b>DR:</b>	Idea.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, isn't it?  I could then—
<b>DR:</b>	Ease them into it.
<b>PT:</b>	Ease them into it, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Fantastic.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	And you could do some of those fun warm weather, warmer weather things that you want to do too.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh—huh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Including making their, uh, Halloween costumes so that—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Not that that's a warm weather thing, but that's—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	It's coming up.
<b>PT:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I think you're doing, like, it's really great that you looked into it, that there are options, and that you see the potential.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I think it could be fantastic.
<b>PT:</b>	I think I just want to try it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I do.
<b>DR:</b>	And I just hope you won't, you know, feel like a failure just because being there 24/7 with 2 small people isn't fulfilling your every heart's desire.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I actually think it's hard to find anybody where it does—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?  That's an awfully small scope and I do think that—
<b>PT:</b>	It's very lonely too.
<b>DR:</b>	People evolve to be social and—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And have interactions.
<b>PT:</b>	I do.  And you know—
<b>DR:</b>	People of all ages.
<b>PT:</b>	It's different even with, from when my mom was to, all mothers stayed home.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	They just did.
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	And she said to me we had it differently because my mom, like I had [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] next door and we had the pool where, you know, we would go down to the [INAUDIBLE].  I don't have any of that.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  There's so little support all around.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It really is and then on top of that, everyone like, like women just not being able to win either way.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, definitely not.
<b>PT:</b>	Like [INAUDIBLE] like we are just screwed—
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	And we are just, it's awful.  I mean it—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Really is.
<b>DR:</b>	Someone's always going to have an opinion for [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	And, and they will tell you whether it's solicited or not.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Oh—
<b>PT:</b>	They will always tell you—
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	Their opinion [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I remember when I was first married, I started off in a fulltime position and, uh, one of the people who was hiring me was a woman.  Very admirable, uh, psychiatrist, um, and her 2 children were maybe, um, [AGE] and [AGE] or so and she, and I actually was expecting for the first time and she said, well, you know, you really have to go fulltime in any job, you know?  You have to go back full time.  And I knew that I was probably going to want to come back part time.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?  But she certainly, and if, you know, if it works for her, more power to her—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	But, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	It ended up being, being able to evolve that I could start back part time and, you know, as the kids got more independent, take on more hours as need be—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, but, you know, unsolicited and, you know, I just thought to myself, well, your, your system works for you—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But I'm not going to presuppose anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	That's right.
<b>DR:</b>	Nobody can and then, of course, you know, you'll have sort of the radical and intolerant, you know, there's no way to do it but, you know, the stay—at—home parent—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, 24/7.  It's really interesting to start talking with some of those people.  Well, what if it's the dad?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  They may not be so enthusiastic.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	If they were a stay—at—home dad, would they reach out to him?
<b>PT:</b>	Well—
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Because did you ever, did you ever hear people that are like the dads are just, they just want to stay home and be lazy.  They won't take care of the kids kind of thing, you know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b>	And that's a terrible—
<b>PT:</b>	Like—
<b>DR:</b>	Thing to say.
<b>PT:</b>	I know a stay—at—home dad and I know he's not at all like—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like just the idea—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, those awful prejudices.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Or in politics, you know, oh, so and so has 5 children.  Well, no one's saying that about the me, the guy.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] that got me so bad too, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  And I don't know whether, whatever your political beliefs are, she just made a great speech the other night.
<b>DR:</b>	She presents herself very, very—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well.
<b>PT:</b>	So I, I just thought that's pretty cool.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, yeah.  How, you know what, this is just kind of off the subject.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, but how exciting is it that for our next election, we are either going to have a black president or a woman vice president.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Is this, I just never thought I would see this.  I just think it's so cool.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm, I do and I guess may, I, I, maybe it's not, maybe it's bad that I'm even making a comment about it, but we're not that far that it won't be any big, but it is a big deal.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I think it's great.
<b>PT:</b>	It's huge.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean I think it does show the American dream is achievable.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] there are plenty of times to look at the past and say, gosh, I wish we'd come [INAUDIBLE] faster, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.
<b>PT:</b>	How exciting.  I know.  I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  So I'm excited for it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So any way, so that's that.  Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, good for you.  I think that's a [INAUDIBLE] thing—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And I agree about the medication.  Let's not change anything there, you know, especially since you may be having a transition coming up, but it's nice you've got some time to—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Work towards November and investigate and you don't have to make any sudden decisions about placing the kids—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that too is not irrevocable.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] I like this one better; this one is a close second.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  I'm—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I'm really going to do my homework.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So we, we were talking about, um, me making some decisions.  I think what my decision is going to be is to go forward with it and not saying that oh, in this session I just made this decision and, but that maybe what my focus should be now is not all this turmoil and worry, but focusing on daycares—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And making some decisions, informed decisions.
<b>DR:</b>	Almost like from logistics.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] I'm going to give this a try, but it's not irrevocable.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, if it's not working out, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	That makes—yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You have good sense and your husband is a good reality check, you'll be able to look at the big picture and say, if it's not working out, what needs to be different?
<b>PT:</b>	What needs to be different, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it needs to be Wednesdays off, does it need to a different daycare—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it need to be fewer hours, you know, does it need to be more hours.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And you'll definitely be able to, to make those judgments as you go along.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's great.  That's awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yaay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yaay.  So I'm excited.
<b>DR:</b>	Way to go.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, so you should see the little guys.  They're so funny.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, they're adorable.
<b>PT:</b>	They're really beautiful, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] they're ready to have some fun with other kids [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think they are there too.  I know [NAME OTHER] is.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know [NAME OTHER] desperately [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Because even last time we got together, you said, you know, he [INAUDIBLE] play dates and—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, he truly does.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] energy.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh, he is.
<b>DR:</b>	You know?
<b>PT:</b>	He's so funny.
<b>DR:</b>	It's nice to just have a peer goal so who understands how [INAUDIBLE] it is to run up that tree.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, absolutely.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, go on the slip and slide—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Or whatever.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] this morning.  He was like, mom, look at me.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, how cute.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, he's fully.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, they're all such a blast.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're, they're funny.  So, all right, well, that's great and I'm actually going to pay this off—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	While I'm here.
<b>DR:</b>	That sounds good.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, um—
<b>DR:</b>	I'll give you—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	A receipt and then they can run it through for you.  That's fantastic.  And do you want to set another appointment or do you want to wait and see what your work schedule—well, I guess you don't have, you probably won't start until November.
<b>PT:</b>	I, I won't start until November.  So, yeah—
<b>DR:</b>	So we could.
<b>PT:</b>	Let's—
<b>DR:</b>	Great.
<b>PT:</b>	Do that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let's do that.  We'll get it on the book.  So—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] have an 11:30?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I will, uh, explain about my running late and the hold—ups—
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	And such, yeah.  Yeah, that was fine.  Uh, do you think you might prefer somewhere around [DATE], [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, [DATE] would be great.
<b>DR:</b>	Does that sound good?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And, uh, is around 10:00 good?
<b>PT:</b>	Great.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That sounds great.
<b>DR:</b>	Great.  Would you like me to write that down for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] hold you up anymore.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, you've been fine.  I was, it was my series of [INAUDIBLE].  It was like the Odyssey.  You know, I'm heading out the door, I get paged.  I'm not one to drive and talk on a cell phone.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	I just can't.  So I just sat, answered that, that took a while.  So that's when I called you and said I'm running late already.  Then repaving the street and a garbage truck is blocking it too at the same time.  So waiting, waiting, and then, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	You'll just have to wait until the end of the day because now I guess your whole day's backed up.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I'll, I'll explain to folks.  I kind of a had a break in the middle and now I'll probably end up getting occupied, but we can work around that.  Uh, Tuesday, [DATE]—
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, thank you.  I appreciate your flexibility.
<b>PT:</b>	That's awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]  I got the voicemail on there.
<b>PT:</b>	All righty.  Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And then I'll give you [DATE], oh.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.
<b>DR:</b>	I can't believe it.
<b>PT:</b>	I know they keep showing all this stuff from 9/11 [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Do they?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I have friend who gave birth [DATE] and I just felt for her because—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, first of all to know that's going on in the world—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When the most joyous thing that could happen to someone is happening.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, absolutely.
<b>DR:</b>	And then when she would tell people when he was born, they'd say, oh, I'm sorry.  And she just stopped—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, and she's like, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Telling people and I said, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	I know someone born on, I know someone who gave birth on [DATE] too.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, isn't that funny?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, what I, what I suggested was that she could say to people, you know, that his birth was the best thing that happened—
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	On [DATE] or the best thing that could possibly happen—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And people will really, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] to that.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Yeah, they will.  Yeah, they will.  Yeah, they will.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, but I always make it a point to acknowledge his birthday.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh.
<b>DR:</b>	Because that is the hope of the world—
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Right there, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	In the face of something that was just so—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Utterly horrendous.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you $20 or $25 for a co—pay?  I forgot.
<b>PT:</b>	I am $20, I think I'm $25 now
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I was $20.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  All right.
<b>PT:</b>	But, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I have a couple of friends with [DATE] birthdays too.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, my God, it's so crazy.
<b>DR:</b>	But, you know, there's, I, I don't think that should be ruined just because—
<b>PT:</b>	Hum—um, no, it shouldn't.
<b>DR:</b>	It's been incredibly, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Hum—um.
<b>DR:</b>	Bizarre.  It's like we're going to affirm life regardless and the heck with them.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That's the truth, isn't it?
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.  Thanks so much [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	So good to see you.  Congratulations.
<b>PT:</b>	Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	And I look forward to hearing on it.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	On [DATE] how's it going.
<b>PT:</b>	Sounds good.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	Take care.  Bye bye.
