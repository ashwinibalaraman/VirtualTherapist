<b>The article that follows is part of the
<i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>'s ongoing <i>First
Person Accounts</i> series. It is the first
to present the views of a family
member rather than a patient, and
describes the author's responses to
her participation in a patient and
family support project. We hope that
mental health professionals—the <i>Bulletin</i>'s
primary audience—will take
this opportunity to learn about the
issues and difficulties confronted by
consumers of mental health care. In
addition, we hope that these accounts
will give patients and families a better
sense of not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be
anticipated by persons with serious
emotional difficulties. We welcome
other contributions from patients, expatients,
or family members. Our
major editorial requirement is that
such contributions be clearly written
and organized and that a novel or
unique aspect of schizophrenia be described,
with special emphasis on
points that will be important for professionals.
Clinicians who see articulate
patients, with experiences they
believe should be shared, might encourage
these patients to submit their
articles to <i>First Person Accounts</i>.

I am a registered nurse, with a mentally
ill son, and I work in a modern
teaching hospital. I barely started my
tour of duty one morning when the
interns and residents began to discuss
the various services they were getting
ready to go to the next morning. One
of the interns whom I knew quite
well said, "I just can't wait to finish
my 6 weeks in Creedmoor." A nurse
joined the conversation and said,
"You did all right in this place, and it
certainly is an initiation for Creedmoor.
Anyway, if you decide to go
crazy, you will be right there." There
was roaring laughter from the group.
The nurse knew that my son had
been in Creedmoor, but her quip was
not personal; it was an ideal time to
get a laugh. What part did I play in
this melodrama? I smiled, of course.
I felt no pain; the intern's anxiety
was showing among his peers. Later
that day I mentioned to him what I
had overheard:


"You will be going to Creedmoor
tomorrow."
<lb>
"You sound very anxious about
going."
</lb><lb>
"Well, I've heard all sorts of experiences
from other doctors."
</lb><lb>
"I doubt very much that you will
have the negative experiences
you've heard about. I know that
you are going to carry with you
the same compassion and understanding
that you have shown to
the medical patients. By the way,
my son is mentally ill, and I am
still struggling with him after 5
years."
</lb>

The Doctor seemed embarrassed;
he began to apologize. I said, "There
is no need to apologize. If you had
not made a joke of it, I would not
have known you were anxious about
going to Creedmoor. I simply want
you to know that you will not get
anyone well in 6 weeks, but you will
make a good impression on the patients."
He thanked me and said, "I
will let you know how I do when I
return."


Later that day, I found myself regressing
to my old way of thinking.
Why did I have to tell him that my
son was mentally ill? Why did I have
to talk so much? I became more angry
with myself as I continued thinking.

[p. <i>285</i>]

This feeling was more intense and
prolonged in the early days of my
son's illness. As I look back, I used
to feel the accusing eye of the psychiatrist
who cared for my son saying,
"You are overprotective; you
must let go." I remember leaving the
hospital feeling, what does he, the
doctor, know anyway? He isn't old
enough to have much professional
experience. Does he understand what
he said to me? How does one "let
go"? How can I "let go"? He is my
son. The pain grew. What did I do
wrong? It can't be me.


I was relieved to hear that there
was a member of my husband's family
who was mentally unstable. So it
is my husband then. I had nothing to
do with it. It is no wonder my son
did not have a chance, I continued to
think; he never got along with his
father anyway. Well, that comes
back to me again. I was always protecting
him.


I remember the day I became quite
angry with myself after I had defended
my son at school. He was
about 8 years old. I began to cry as I
spoke to him when he came home.
He said to me, "Don't cry. Mom. I'll
try to be good, but it's so hard." I
had to smile through the tears. Yes,
he was and is an expert manipulator.
He infuriates me one minute and the
next minute he just breaks my heart.
He is now 29 years old. How do I escape
this maze I am in? I keep going
around and around; there is no
exit—I mean there <i>were</i> no exits until
I began to attend family therapy and
group sessions with the parents and
relatives of the "schizophrenic" patients.
My frustration has not completely
gone, but I feel the sessions
have given me some tools to work
with.


The tools of which I write are
those of accepting my handicapped
son. I encourage him to make himself
useful by working, but do not demand
or expect him to achieve.
When he follows through on any of
my requests, I thank him. I do not
require perfection. Bathing is often a
problem. To the rest of us, bathing is
a pleasure; but for my son, it is a
chore. It may be that he is depressed
or feels he has no reason to want to
bathe. I know that he often has irrational
fears, e.g., he might get killed
in the shower or die of a heart attack;
we talk about these fears. During
such times, I shampoo and even
comb his hair, and give him dean
clothes after he takes a shower. He
says, "Mom, I feel much better." I
try not to be critical and to give him
simple, understandable directions.
Sometimes I have to start, for example,
cleaning his room, and then ask
him to help me. So we make the bed
together. I also help him to understand
his illness when he complains.
In our group sessions we were informed
about the symptoms of
schizophrenia.


My son complains of hearing his
own heart beat, which frightens him;
of pounding in his head at times; of
restlessness and sleeplessness. A few
weeks ago, we were both successful
in managing one of his, as he calls it,
"anxiety spells." He said, "I am
getting sick again, but I will kill myself
before I go back to the hospital. I
spent 5 months this last time. That is
enough." I was a bit worried by the
statement. I had noticed signs of restlessness.
I said to him, "If we work
together, you won't need to go to the
hospital." He started to be very talkative,
even to irritate me. He rehashed
old wounds about his father.
I said to him, "Why don't you tell
me what you are feeling and stop
talking about your father?" He said,
"I feel like running the streets—you
know, what I used to do." We talked
back and forth with a few near quarrels
until I suggested that he take a
shower. With a lot of persuading, he
finally did. I gave him a backrub and
his medicine and he slept for the rest
of the night. We have since then
overcome a more severe attack by
consulting his doctor, by phone. We
increased his medication, and decreased
the medication when the anxiety
phase passed. My son is very
slowly beginning to assume responsibility
for himself through understanding
his illness. He made all the
phone calls to his doctor.


He made himself a bit of a nuisance
in the process. He accused me
of overdosing him. I reminded him
that he gave me the instruction that
the doctor had given him. Then he
asked, "Mom, do you think I am
going to die?" I reassured him, "You
won't die." He lay in his bed, his feet
going up and down faster and faster.
He said, "I am running the street in
bed." He later went to sleep for over
10 hours. When he awakened, he
progressively returned to calm. I continue
to be disappointed but accepting
of him. I no longer wish he were
somewhere else. I encourage him but
not demandingly. I embrace him confortably
at times and still maintain
my distance as his mother. If he
tends to be demanding, I tell him
when I feel depressed and cannot
deal with his self-indulgence. He often
overwhelms me. I even show my
despair, for how else can I make him
know I am only human?


It was a tiring day at work. I was
happy to get home until I opened the
door. The odor confronted me at the
door, from the dog not having been
walked that day. I walked into the
kitchen, and the sink was strewn
with dirty dishes. I called my son's
attention to the mess; he angrily
said, "What do you want me to do
about it?" With that, I felt enraged,

[p. <i>286</i>]

The next day, he greeted me at the
door with arms outstretched. He
hugged me as I came through the
door. He cupped my chin in both his
hands and said, "Don't ever let me
hear you say again that you failed in
raising us; you are a great mother
and we all appreciate you very
much." I did feel somewhat "childlike"
for a moment. Between my two
sons, they arranged to take turns and
help with the chores. That was something
I was trying to have done for
many years. I do not think I will get
away with anything quite so easily
again. These are the signs of hope
which linger and give me strength to
persevere with helping my son.


My son is a human being with
feelings; he is capable of compassion
when he has his own emotions under
control. For me, group meetings have
provided insights into my own weaknesses.
It is safe to say that group
meetings have helped to keep me
from "going off the deep end." Instead,
I am able to surmount my
shame and embarrassment, eliminate
my pain and blame, accept my son
as he is, and use my energies to help
him. I hope he can begin to grow
emotionally and psychologically
again, as much as he possibly and
realistically can. But most of all, I
hope he can keep in touch with himself
and where he is. I believe group
sessions have been successful for me.
