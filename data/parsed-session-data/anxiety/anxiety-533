BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	I need to remember to ask you too, I've got two refill requests from [DEIDENTIFIED] I want to talk to you about but let's talk about how you're doing first then we can take care of those, okay.  So how are you doing?
<b>PT:</b>	I seem to be doing all right.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  What's new, anything in the last couple months?
<b>PT:</b>	Nope.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you doing anything new or just working like you had been?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good, do you have bowling today?
<b>PT:</b>	Yep.
<b>DR:</b>	What time do you go?  Right after the appointment?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Right after the appointment.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, did [NAME OTHER] bring you today?
<b>PT:</b>	No, my mom did, [NAME OTHER] was with us.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so how's your mood or your spirits been lately, you been doing okay?  So, so?  Okay, not depressed, not happy just somewhere in the middle or more on the high or low side?
<b>PT:</b>	The lower side.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  A little bit down.  Okay, are you sleeping okay at night?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, to tell you the truth, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?
<b>PT:</b>	No, the thing is I wake up in the middle of the night to find out my mask has slipped off.
<b>DR:</b>	Your CPAP mask?  And then when you put it back on are you able to get back to sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah but it's irritating.
<b>DR:</b>	To wake up and find it off you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And then when you wake up in the morning [PATIENT NAME] do you feel rested?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  Well, in the morning I'm dead tired.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay and then once you get up and get going, do you feel more energy or do you feel tired throughout the day?
<b>PT:</b>	I feel tired all the time.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How has your appetite been?
<b>PT:</b>	My appetite has been around the same.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you able to concentrate pretty well when you're at work or do you find your mind drifting off a lot.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it drifts off.  I concentrate and it also drifts off a little bit.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Do you find yourself worrying about things a lot or not too much?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Not too much, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	My dad was diagnosed with diabetes last month.  I didn't feel a thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Your father was?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I asked him a few questions but I didn't really feel a thing, feel anything.
<b>DR:</b>	And that was just last week you said?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, a week or two ago.  He was diagnosed and uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I didn't really feel anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Oddly expected but I didn't, you know, I asked a few questions.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [PATIENT NAME] have you been getting enjoyment out of day to day activities or do you feel like you're just kind of going through the motions?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm just going through the motions.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Hoping [INAUDIBLE] would end.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, it's not enjoying it.  Have you been having any thoughts of not wanting to live or thoughts of taking your own life?
<b>PT:</b>	Every once in a while, every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Every day or some days?
<b>PT:</b>	Every once in a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Every once in a while.  Does it ever get to the point where you think about how you would take your own life if you were going to do it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And how do you think you would take your own life?
<b>PT:</b>	A lot of ways, hang yourself, mix a lethal drug, a drug alcohol, chemical content, there's a lot of things I could do.
<b>DR:</b>	So how do you deal with those thoughts when you get them, do you just try to push them out of your head or do you do something else?
<b>PT:</b>	I push them aside.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm sorry, you said you can push them aside?
<b>PT:</b>	I push them aside.  There are also more, less subtle thoughts.
<b>DR:</b>	They're less subtle, what do you mean?
<b>PT:</b>	Homicidal.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, you get homicidal thoughts at times.  Anybody in particular you think about killing or you just get mad in general at people?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's mainly my mom.
<b>DR:</b>	You think about killing your mother?
<b>PT:</b>	These days, these days when don't we.
<b>DR:</b>	So has there been a lot of conflict between you and your mother?
<b>PT:</b>	In a way.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay and [PATIENT NAME], when you have those thoughts, I mean do you ever feel like you would act on them or do you think, you know, you know better than that, you would never do that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, to tell you the truth I don't know, I don't know if I would act on them or not.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	There's a side of me that may act, there's a side of me that wouldn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, have you talked to your mother about that and let her know how angry you are?
<b>PT:</b>	She knows how angry I am.
<b>DR:</b>	That you've thought about killing her, does she know that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my dad knows, I discussed it with him one night.
<b>DR:</b>	So what do you do when you get that angry, to avoid acting out those thoughts?
<b>PT:</b>	I do what I do best, hide it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, do you have some other way of getting your anger out, like you leave the room and go somewhere else or do you do something else?
<b>PT:</b>	What else is there to do?
<b>DR:</b>	Well you could—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm on top of a hill, on top of a mountain in the forest.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I was thinking, have you ever talked to your mother about, let her know what you're upset about?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she knows what I'm upset about.
<b>DR:</b>	So you talk with her about it?  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Not exact details but she knows.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	The thing is there's also the fact, if I look back when these thoughts are occurring, they feel more pleasurable.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well [PATIENT NAME] how do you prevent yourself from acting on those thoughts, how can you do that so you don't, you know, harm your mother or get yourself in trouble.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not sure what's stopping me, whether it's my meds—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And what about, have you been hearing any voices that other people don't seem to hear recently?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	Have you been hearing any voices that other people don't seem to hear recently?
<b>PT:</b>	Well recently something happened at work, it was bizarre.
<b>DR:</b>	What was that?
<b>PT:</b>	This messenger came looking for one of my coworkers and I went [INAUDIBLE] he was holding a packet for one of my coworkers, he was looking for him and he says he's looking for, he said his first name, he didn't say his last, so I told him he's inside, he's a cashier, the guys a cashier, I tell him he's inside, he's a cashier, I told him his last name and told him he's in the store.  A few minutes later I told the coworker that someone was looking for him and did he get the package and he said what package?
<b>DR:</b>	So he didn't get it?  Huh, okay, but the courier was there, you saw and talked to him, it wasn't like you just heard a voice talking to you out of nowhere?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you ever hear a voice that comes from nowhere or no person but you can still hear it?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, yeah, I've heard someone call my name and I look all around and they're not, and no one's there, just my name, that's all.
<b>DR:</b>	Has that happened recently or is that in the past?
<b>PT:</b>	It's happened a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the thing is I'm not the only person named [PATIENT NAME] in this world.
<b>DR:</b>	No, you're not.  Okay, do you ever see things that other people don't see [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	Well not really.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But you look at, you look at things around, look around, you know, I don't see anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	If I was little, I could see things—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I could see, maybe things only children can see but it's interesting, [INAUDIBLE] just in time.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, what about [PATIENT NAME] do you feel unsafe these days, like people are following you or trying to harm you in any way?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay, do you believe or feel like people are talking about you, like if you're at work, you know, behind your back or anything like that?
<b>PT:</b>	No, not really, no.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you having any problems or side effects from the medication that you're aware of?
<b>PT:</b>	Define side effects?
<b>DR:</b>	Any negative effects or effects that you don't like.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't know about, you're not answering my questions, what side effects?
<b>DR:</b>	You mean what are some examples of side effects?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh like dry mouth or constipation or dizziness or lightheadedness.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, dry mouth, that's about, sometimes, a couple times I had a little problem, standing up, I had a little problem on my feet, other than that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right.
<b>PT:</b>	But of course the problem with my feet may be because I was a little bit tired those days.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, no stomach upset?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But the thing is, I have a lump back here, it's getting bigger and that's one of the problems I talked about a few months earlier.  My mom refuses to acknowledge it.  She thinks it's my shunt rubbing up against the back of my head.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But the thing is, I don't think so and it's getting bigger.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, probably the thing to do about that would be, when you see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] next time, point it out to him.
<b>PT:</b>	I did point it out to him.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	He took an x—ray.  He took an x—ray and nothing showed up on it.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But the thing is, some of these things, some of these tumors or whatever they noticed, don't always show up on x—rays.
<b>DR:</b>	True.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's why certain scans are needed to see them, MRI, CT scan using a certain dye so you can see your blood, veins and stuff like that.  That's the way to see a tumor but the thing is, these x—rays, just because you take an x—ray doesn't mean you're going to see something.
<b>DR:</b>	That's true.  Well, what I would suggest [PATIENT NAME] is when you see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] again, point it out to him again to see if it's changing from the last time you saw him.  I don't know, do you have any other suggestions?
<b>PT:</b>	Wait another year for him to see me?
<b>DR:</b>	Will that be your next appointment?
<b>PT:</b>	The fact I have pains in the back of my neck that come and go and the fact it's very very irritating, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Did [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] have anything to say about it when he examined you before?
<b>PT:</b>	He says there's not, he says, I told him, I pointed out to him, I don't think it's my shunt, he agreed.
<b>DR:</b>	Did he say what he thought it was or what you should do about it?
<b>PT:</b>	He didn't know what it was but to do an x—ray, it turned out to be, the x—rays came out normal.  The thing is, x—rays, x—rays don't capture, x—rays don't exactly capture anything—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Certain type things, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Did he have any suggestions for you on what you should do about it?
<b>PT:</b>	No, he didn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But you know, x—rays are more looking at bones or to the bone.  Unless you have a cancer and cancers are hard as a brick, so that's why you can see those but some of them are so deep in there, you can't, or [INAUDIBLE] brain tissue, you can't pick them up.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well  [PATIENT NAME], I'm not sure what to do about that either.  That's not really my area of expertise.
<b>PT:</b>	I know that.
<b>DR:</b>	So the only thing I can suggest is you might try to talk to someone who would know more about it, like maybe your family physician or [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] your neurologist, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm hoping it's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] but—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I've got to wait till what, July?  Right now it's, God, what is it now?  Is it March still?
<b>DR:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	So I've got four months.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	April, May, June, July.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well [PATIENT NAME], are your mom and [NAME OTHER] out there?
<b>PT:</b>	My mom's, yeah, I think they're out there.
<b>DR:</b>	Why don't we let her in.  Is there anything else you want to talk about before I talk to your mom?  Okay, let me invite her in.  Hi there, hi [NAME OTHER]
<b>CG:</b>	Hello.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE], okay.  Sure you don't want to join us?
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Hi [NAME OTHER]
<b>CG:</b>	Hello.
<b>DR:</b>	How are you?
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  Well, how are things going with [PATIENT NAME] do you think overall?
<b>CG:</b>	Well, I think he's a mighty busy guy.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, is he.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What's going on that he's so busy?
<b>CG:</b>	Well, he's going to school and he's working.  If he's not going to school, he's working.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a lot, yeah.  I didn't even ask you, how's school going?
<b>PT:</b>	I thought I was doing pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	Good, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] class.
<b>DR:</b>	And which class are you taking again?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm taking [INAUDIBLE] speaking.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yes, okay.  Well, [NAME OTHER] do you feel like [PATIENT NAME] is handling things okay overall?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>CG:</b>	I think he's very conscientious for the school thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Good, good, so he seems to be handling the stress reasonably well from what you can tell?  Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	He's going to bed at night, getting himself up, going in extra to get work done that he didn't get done—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	And doing it on his own, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.
<b>CG:</b>	He's got trouble with the sleepiness still but—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, still sleepy during the day?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, we went to see a counselor over there at [DEIDENTIFIED] yesterday and he practically fell asleep talking to her.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>CG:</b>	I mean you could just, his eyes rolled up and—
<b>DR:</b>	That's hard, okay.  Well, you know, from what [PATIENT NAME] was telling me, I mean it sounds like he feels like he's doing okay overall and [PATIENT NAME] correct me if I'm wrong, a little down at times and pretty tired all the time.  The only other thing that he mentioned today that's kind of new is just, I think this is nothing, he said it's nothing new that you don't know about, that he gets real angry with you sometimes and he said we need to talk to you about that and it's getting to the point of having homicidal thoughts at times and so we talked about how do you handle that, you know, if you get that angry and I think [PATIENT NAME], what you said is sometimes you leave the room, is that what you told me?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I just bury it.
<b>DR:</b>	You just bury it, you said, he just kind of stuffs it away.  So just [NAME OTHER], you know, maybe if he's getting that angry, maybe he needs to talk to someone.  He said well we live out here, there's not a lot of people to talk to but you said you did talk, you have talked to your dad at times, is that right?
<b>CG:</b>	So what is it I'm supposed to have done that you're mad about?  That mad that your, homicidal?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the thing is, the fact, I'm pulling my part of the house, I'm pulling my part in the house and [NAME OTHER] is not pulling his.  I pull his extra weight even though I work and go to school and so does he go to work and go to school.  You know, that's part of living that he works all day and goes to school.
<b>DR:</b>	So [PATIENT NAME] if that's the case, I would think you would be mad at [NAME OTHER] rather than your mother, what causes you to mad at your mother?
<b>PT:</b>	Because my mom allows it to go on.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>CG:</b>	I allow it to go on?  Well, you know, there's this thing called helping each other out.  When you get home tonight, you're not going to have to put the trash cans away and you know why, because I made your brother get out the car and put them away, then he had to go in the house, turn the alarm off, wash his hands and come back out again because the trash cans were sitting there.  [NAME OTHER] was going to let them just sit there, that's [PATIENT NAME]'s job he's telling me, but I made him get out and put them away for you but, you see, you won't even notice that.
<b>PT:</b>	That's not the point, the point is, inside the house, of course, I do the trash without complaint, you know, but the thing with the kitchen, you know, it's just every time [NAME OTHER] leaves dishes in that kitchen, I have to clean them up.  Every time he makes a mess somewhere, I have to clean it up, you know, he has to learn to clean up his messes, his crap—
<b>CG:</b>	Well, he does sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, [PATIENT NAME], that's one of the frustrating things about living with a family is that sometimes people don't always do everything they're supposed to do.  That happens at our house too and sometimes we end up cleaning up after each other.  What I would suggest, maybe than rather get so angry at your mom, maybe you could just remind [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	That's not just, that's not it, also is that I, [NAME OTHER] said you work all day, blah, blah, blah and I work all day, I'm tired too, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And he, if I use that excuse, I wouldn't get away with it.  He uses it because he gets away with it all the time.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, he works 8 hours a day, you work 4, 5, so there's 3 hours, he works 3 hours more than you.  Now if you're feeling tired all the time, I'm not surprised because you don't have the time to lay around and sleep the way you used to.  Now you have to get up and you have to go, you've got to get in that taxi and go to school, you've got to get in that taxi and go to work, so you've got one day a week, Saturday, and that's if you don't go out with [NAME OTHER] or [NAME OTHER], otherwise you're doing something all day, you don't have any time to sit and sleep the way you used to, so yeah, you're tired.  Okay, you think you have homicidal tendencies, you watch enough TV, what happens on these TV shows you watch when somebody does commit a homicide?
<b>PT:</b>	They get rid of them, they go to prison.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh—huh, you just remember that.
<b>PT:</b>	I know that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, [PATIENT NAME], I think the main point I want to make today is I know we all get angry at times and we get mad at our family sometimes but there are healthy ways to deal with anger and unhealthy ways to deal with anger and I just want to make sure that you're finding healthy ways to deal with it so it doesn't create more problems because if we don't deal with it in a healthy way, it will cause us problems, whether it's tension at home or whether it's arguing or fighting, whether it's getting depressed or something, so what I would encourage you to do is if there's something that's making you upset or angry, talk to someone about it, talk to your dad, talk to your mom.
<b>PT:</b>	And I did, she just blows me off.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you feel like you're not being heard by your mom, talk to your dad, talk to [NAME OTHER], talk to someone so you're not just stuffing it and keeping it inside.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my dad agrees with me on some of these things.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay, we agree, what do you want us to do?  Just because we don't do exactly what you want—
<b>PT:</b>	That's not the point.
<b>DR:</b>	Well and [PATIENT NAME], I think it is important that you're heard and talk about it, it doesn't mean that people will always agree with us, you know, about things and that can be frustrating sometimes.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not about what I want or what dad wants or what [NAME OTHER] wants or what you want, it's about what goes on and what, if I make a mess, I clean it up, if someone makes a mess, they need to clean it up.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, [INAUDIBLE] an awful lot, I clean up every single day, a juice glass where you get up and go upstairs and take your medicine and leave the glass sitting on the counter or you get stuff out, there's crumbs on the island, I clean that up every day.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b>	So [PATIENT NAME] I think the point I hear your mom making is that sometimes in families we have to kind of help each other out a little bit and sometimes it's better if we don't upset and angry with each other if we can help it but—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the thing is, I fly out the door, [NAME OTHER] comes home and make a big mess, leaves it deliberately, deliberately leaves it for us to clean up.
<b>DR:</b>	Well,  [PATIENT NAME], let's work on this some more than, okay, I don't think we're going to solve it today but let's keep talking about this, okay, so we see if there are, again, ways that you find that are constructive to deal with that anger that comes up, thinking about hurting people, okay, because I don't think that's constructive, it doesn't help anybody, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	And being belligerent to your brother and talking belligerent isn't going to get you anywhere either.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now I want to check—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if I'll be nice to him, it's not going to get me anywhere either.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe there's some things we can try [PATIENT NAME] that will help, okay.  I wanted to double check with you too, I got two refill requests for the mail order for Lexapro and the Thioridazine.  I don't think we need to make any changes on those dosages.  Do you feel a need to change anything [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, not really, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, in some areas, I got a little bit better since you, since I cut that one pill in half.
<b>CG:</b>	Provigil.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh the Provigil, okay, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	But that's the one that wakes you up and you're the one sitting there having a hard time.  How long does it take that Provigil to work?
<b>DR:</b>	Usually within a half hour to an hour it kicks in and it can last anywhere from 4 hours to 12 hours, it really varies.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, it should have been working yesterday morning [PATIENT NAME], it sure wasn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes it works better than others, unfortunately, it's not always—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the thing about Provigil is it's supposed to wake you up.  I also have other medications that put me back to sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Well [PATIENT NAME] how about this, how about if we don't make any changes in the medication this time, if that's okay with you.  Let's give it another month and see how you're doing.  I know you are busy, like your mom said, and that's stressful sometimes too, school and work.  Let's give it another month and see how things are going, does that sound all right with you and I'll refill the prescription for you, does that sound all right, the same dosages?  Is that okay [PATIENT NAME]?  Okay.  Let's give it another month and check back.  Is there anything else [NAME OTHER] that you need to talk about today?
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  [PATIENT NAME] was there anything else that you felt like we needed to talk about today?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I think we got everything covered.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, let's see here, we can do a Wednesday again, around one thirty is that right?  Okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, now see he gets off, well , right now he gets off work at one thirty.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, so even a little after, two o'clock would be better.
<b>PT:</b>	Two o'clock would work.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, quarter till or two o'clock.
<b>PT:</b>	Quarter, quarter—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, we have the half hours, well here, what have I got here, the next—
<b>CG:</b>	We could go two months.
<b>DR:</b>	I was going to say, the next time I have, I've got a time on [DATE], you can have your choice of one thirty or two, would that work, that's about a month and a half.  Okay.  So two o'clock works better you said?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, but by then he'll be out of school so who knows.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, so we can do one thirty or two, whichever you prefer.
<b>CG:</b>	Let's do the one thirty.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And that day, just to let you know, I'll be coming back from a meeting in [DEIDENTIFIED], it's over at one, so if you should get here and the door is locked, I haven't forgot about you, I might have just got caught in traffic or something.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	That's Wednesday and if you have anything you need before then [PATIENT NAME], call me or have your mom call me, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if the doors or locked here, I could always rest in the car.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I should be back in time, just in case there's something unexpected that happens, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, there you are.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll take care of those refills, I'll mail, I'll fax those back to them, okay, they're mail order prescriptions?
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, they contacted you?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they faxed me with the, both for the Thioridazine and the Lexapro, they wanted refills so I want to just check before I fax them back to make sure—
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Everything was going okay, all right.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, good seeing you [NAME OTHER], [PATIENT NAME]—
<b>CG:</b>	Good to see you.
<b>DR:</b>	Take care of yourself, okay.  Are you going to go out and get [NAME OTHER] or it doesn't matter to me.
<b>CG:</b>	We'll leave [NAME OTHER] here.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, see you later.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>CG:</b>	I wouldn't do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, bye, take it easy.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good time.  All right.
