COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:00.6) number nine. I imagine (inaudible at 0:00:06.9)
PATIENT: (Chuckle)
COUNSELOR: Pretty -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:09.6) you're ready to -
PATIENT: Yeah. Kids are always starting to do (inaudible at 0:00:16.5) going to be tornado and it be a tornado. Go home. (Chuckle) I don't care. (inaudible at 0:00:26.2)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:00:26.4) tornado?
PATIENT: No. We had a tornado warning or something - that someone heard something and the word spread and they said, "Oh, is there going to be a tornado?"
COUNSELOR: Giving (inaudible at 0:00:35.7) it's important.
PATIENT: Uh-hm. Right. Once I ran and saw we can't go home in the rain. Luckily it died down (Laughter) just in time for them to leave the building. (Laughter). Oh wow. How have you been? (Chuckles) 0:00:58.8
COUNSELOR: Pretty good.
PATIENT: (Chuckles) that's good. I've been fine. It's still kind of awkward for me to get started I don't know why. It shouldn't be at this point.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:14.6) feel kind of like each time (inaudible at 0:01:16.5) ready to hear (inaudible at 0:01:17.3) awkward.
PATIENT: Yeah right. It really does. I don't know why it should. It really shouldn't (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:24.9)
PATIENT: Yeah that's - I think it's, there again, afraid to take the initiative, afraid to speak up and (Crosstalk) Yeah, just to get started.
COUNSELOR: Just get started.
PATIENT: Yeah right. I shouldn't be like �wow!' I don't think I should be at this point, but anyway. Oh, it was a nice weekend.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:55.0) but still.
PATIENT: Well no. (inaudible at 0:01:58.3) I admit there is nothing going on (inaudible at 0:02:02.2). (Chuckles). I (inaudible at 0:02:08.3) we went, oh, we went (inaudible at 0:02:09.1) real good idea he was a friend of Sara's and he was a Baptist minister.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But he's Jewish (Chuckles) but he was really a character for leaving the ministry (Chuckles). It was kind of interesting (inaudible at 0:02:30.1) and then Saturday night then (inaudible at 0:02:34.8) Tanya and I went to the show and Tanya came back up to the apartment which is nice (Chuckles). 0:02:40.5
COUNSELOR: Huh-huh.
PATIENT: Well we made out and all that stuff. It was nice (Chuckles). One thing that is kind of concerning well she says we're making love and all this stuff and she says something like, "Don't you want to?" And I said, "Yes I want to" and she says, "Well why not?" and I said something like "I'll still have to overcome my fear that something like that and she says, "Oh! Well what are you worried about?" I said, "I don't know, I just don't know." and she was, "What's (inaudible at 0:03:22.1) and I said, "Oh sometimes if I start thinking, if I start worrying about heading (ph) the erection it go and I don't have an erection and all the stuff and she seemed to be very sympathetic about the whole thing (Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:03:35.2)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: You were able to say (inaudible at 0:03:38.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I was - which is kind of nice she just said, "You worry too much." (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So you know.
COUNSELOR: She's right there.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. She was. I said, "Yes. You're right." I said, "You're right." So we're talking about it and she said (inaudible at 0:03:57.2) and she says, "You really want to?" And I said, "Yes." I say I think about her all the time and all that stuff and I say I said that, "Just I don't know if it's going to take me more time or whatever because I don't know what it is."
COUNSELOR: Alright.
PATIENT: And she says she really didn't have much to say about it and but at any rate she knows. (Chuckles).
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I called her. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at0:04:29.0) kind of in a way.
PATIENT: Oh, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Stable.
PATIENT: It really was. It was really kind of nice. It was really nice. I did a dance of taking her blouse off (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: What choice - I'm progressively getting better (Chuckles) at any rate (Chuckles). But I enjoyed it much more, in fact, I wasn't - I didn't - I wasn't worried about having an erection as much as I was before. Like it was getting to be easier and easier like -
COUNSELOR: Easier and easier.
PATIENT: Just too even start making love it's not an awkward feeling.
COUNSELOR: Right. Kind of feels -
PATIENT: Yeah. Like it's natural. It's kind of - everything is kind of (Crosstalk) -
COUNSELOR: Less and less of kind of a psychological struggle. 0:05:17.8
PATIENT: Really. It's - and then it gets better.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:22.5) really kind of (Chuckles) to see that happening.
PATIENT: Yeah. It gets better and instead of like from - it really gets better as you go on (Chuckles). But it was not - it was kind of nice. It really was. And then I said something like, "I love you." and she said, "It's the first time you ever said that." and I thought, �Wow!' (Chuckles). It was too.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:48.9) nice too.
PATIENT: Yeah it was. It really was. It was nice to say it and I never realized that I never said it.
COUNSELOR: I guess I hear you saying like that she does want to sleep with you -
PATIENT: Oh. Yeah. She does.
COUNSELOR: When you're ready for it?
PATIENT: Uh hmm. Alright.
COUNSELOR: I think you're there.
PATIENT: Right. So I just I keep on telling myself "Well you just can't" — I just - I keep on saying to myself, "Why don't I?" and then I say to myself, "Well I really want to. Well why don't I?" Well then I kind of rationalize or something kind of expect everything at once and all this stuff and you have to take things as they come and all this stuff. But still - 0:06:40.7
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like (inaudible at 0:06:41.6) you stood up to the vegetable (ph), "Why don't I? "
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Why don't I? Well I really want to -
COUNSELOR: Then it's like you really do want to but it's kind of like saying, "Well a little bit of time doesn't quite make it all seem okay.
PATIENT: No it doesn't. No.
COUNSELOR: Feels like a rational -
PATIENT: Yeah. Right .
COUNSELOR: And you know you're kind of left wondering well why the hell - what's stopping me?
PATIENT: Yeah that's it (Crosstalk) yeah, right. That's it (Chuckles) what's stopping me if I really want to? That's (Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: You really want this something - just think of -
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Right.
COUNSELOR: I guess it's - what is it some kind of (inaudible at 0:07:20.8) or -
PATIENT: I don't know what it is. I really do not know what it is. You know something like - I really don't know what it is. I - maybe something that is (inaudible at 0:07:32.1) (Chuckles) I keep on saying to myself, "Well of course I'd never really made love to woman before as much as I made love to Tanya now." and I (inaudible at 0:07:47.4) well I've done that - why should I be afraid of this and I - it's really weird. I don't know why. I really don't know why. (inaudible at 0:08:01.1)
COUNSELOR: Is it kind of like the more I — what's holding you back (inaudible at 0:08:07.7) if you say (inaudible at 0:08:08.8) afraid or anxious about what will happen or -
PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe .
COUNSELOR: Scared that you won't be able to do -
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know if it's all there or not. I said to myself, "Well, if she hadn't said anything I might have." (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like -
COUNSELOR: Kind of feel pressed or something?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right (inaudible at 0:08:38.1)
COUNSELOR: Pressured.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. If she hadn't said anything like �why don't you?' and then maybe I wouldn't have even thought about it I would have just kept on.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like when she said, "Why don't you?"
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. 0:08:49.1
COUNSELOR: She kind of raised the whole thing.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right .
COUNSELOR: Or �why don't I?'
PATIENT: Yeah. Right (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: And that's (inaudible at 0:08:53.5)
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Made you feel pressure like here she was really wanting to -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Kind of made it kind of seemed tawdry because it couldn't just - it didn't feel like it would just happen on its own.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: She was -
PATIENT: Right. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Demanding that you - 0:09:08.4
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And like it feels like the heart thinks (ph) you anyway but to feel that demand -
PATIENT: That demand. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: The heart (ph).
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Right. (inaudible at 0:09:22.7) she had mentioned about this guy (inaudible at 0:09:48.8) and she said that she was supposed to - this summer, I guess (inaudible at 0:09:55.0) he wanted her to meet him in Dallas and she was going to and then she changed her mind and she said that's one of the reasons why she's going to stay and so she won't go to Dallas. I didn't actually really give (ph). And why do you have to go to Spain and not go to Dallas?
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:10:21.1)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: Did you ask her to explain that?
PATIENT: No I never really did. I never - I didn't think about that at that time but later on.
COUNSELOR: I understand
PATIENT: You know if - just didn't seem to make that much sense; why are you going to Spain not to go to Dallas? Well she probably just really wants to go to Spain but (Chuckles). Which is really kind of weird and I did tell her I said, "Well when you go I'll miss you." and all that and she says, "Well I'm not really sure if I'm going to go or not yet." At any rate, but she does - she really seems genuinely excited about (inaudible at 0:10:54.5) so maybe she just wants to go to Spain. She says, "Well she's not going to go to Dallas."
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like she's - if she did go to Spain, it's not because she's trying to get away from you.
PATIENT: Yeah. Maybe that's — yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:11:09.2) something with real positive thinking.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. That's true. And she would - she was talking about everything else which we had never discussed before. And she said that how he was and what type of a person that he was and very sure and very cocky of himself and (inaudible at 0:11:32.3) everything and all that stuff.
COUNSELOR: How'd that make you feel?
PATIENT: Well I - and then she says, "Well he's a lot like you in many ways." (Chuckles) and then, "Oh yeah?" She says, "Yeah. He really is like (inaudible at 0:11:47.5)." But it didn't - knowing, like I said, knowing that he's a 1,000 miles away.
COUNSELOR: Yeah kind of like she was - be saying all those things (inaudible at 0:11:59.5) to ensure -
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I don't even know the man.
COUNSELOR: Something - people really present you might feel kind of threatened by that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Threatened him, but the fact is he -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Away and she's (inaudible at 0:12:13.6)
PATIENT: Yeah. And she says - well she said that when she was down there and her sister was there and he wasn't really the same around her sister and she says well after her sister left and she stayed that extra day that's when he was kind of like himself. But she said - she just - she really didn't - she really - she said she wasn't - she's in love with him too. But she was very honest about it and she does. She said her sister, when her sister was down there, I think he just felt very uncomfortable around her and all that stuff and she says he's kind of black but he's not. She has a feeling that he doesn't want to be black and he says, like, when she looks at him he says you're looking at a (inaudible at 0:13:23.6) man and she, and he's, she says he has all white friends and stuff like that. He has a feeling that she feels sorry he doesn't really want to be black or doesn't like to be black.
COUNSELOR: How did the -
PATIENT: I was kind of happy she told me. It's kind of nice.
COUNSELOR: You could understand how she'd want to tell you?
PATIENT: Yeah. Well I just I - something we had never really talked about it. She said, "You never really brought it up." or something like this.
COUNSELOR: Kind of what the deal? Well once she said the fact that she said -
PATIENT: Said it. Yeah. Right. Like she really came out and said how she felt about him and at least you know what you're up against if nothing else.
COUNSELOR: I guess there's more than a [traffic accident] (ph), it was just kind of a feeling of sharing this stuff?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Really.
COUNSELOR: Sharing your feelings about sex with her.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: That she felt anxious about it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And her sharing these things with you. 0:14:35.0
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: Kind of sounds like they're really kind of poor (ph) development.
PATIENT: Yeah it was right uh-huh. We sat and talked until about 5:00. It was nice. It really was. (inaudible at 0:14:50.9). I saw Jen again this weekend. Remember that girl that - who I've been in and had that experience in bed before? Her name was Jen.
COUNSELOR: The one (Crosstalk) with you?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Her name was Jen and her father had died and so we had gone up to the wake and I haven't seen her in, God, since the Christmas holidays we hadn't seen each other. Tanya really dislikes her and I don't know why. I think to myself, "Well, I like Jen. I think she's really a nice person." I'd never go back to bed with her or anything but I really genuinely enjoyed being with her. She's a lot of fun. She's - you can really sit down and have a really nice conversation with her. And she has a thing, and it's interesting, but she knows she's the type of a woman that knows how to deal with men and she knows when to say something and when not to say something and stuff like that. She really genuinely knows; I believe this. And they have a feeling that Jen was a slut, Jen will sleep with anybody and all this stuff and meeting Tanya, and Jean has this feeling, and afterward when we were driving back and I said to Sheila I said oh something about, "Oh hon, what did you think about seeing Jen again?" and she said, "Well" and I said, "Well, would you consider going out and seeing her again?" and she was, "No, I wouldn't." She wouldn't go out and I said, "I would" and she said, "Well go right ahead" (Chuckles). But it was a very sarcastic thing, I think, the way she said it (inaudible at 0:16:54.1).
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:54.3)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. (Chuckles) That's the whole thing. I do. I intend to call Jen and keep in contact with her. I mean I'm not just to drop it right there. I really - I enjoyed talking to her. But I'm sure Tanya's thinking, �After what she pulled with you, how could you possibly?' (Chuckle) and I think, "Well I don't know but I just like the person." I think she's really nice - really nice being there. (inaudible at 0:17:29.8) I said, "Well God damn why would go to her father's wake if you didn't intend on seeing her again?" You didn't come to see her father; he's dead. (Chuckles). The only reason you would come is because you felt something toward her and you would want to see her and express your sorrow to her at least make her feel better about it. Give her company or something else I thought to myself, �Why would you go?' and I didn't ask her (Chuckles) and I should have. I don't know why I didn't ask her but I didn't ask her. I knew her reaction would have been instantaneously like; she'd blowed up right there. (Chuckles). There have been half (inaudible at 0:18:11.5) I should have - it really crossed my mind that, "What the hell is your problem? Why would you go?"
COUNSELOR: Her attitude really bothered you (inaudible at0:18:26.9)
PATIENT: It did.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:18:27.8) it was wrong.
PATIENT: Yeah it was really wrong. It didn't feel anything towards Jen because -
COUNSELOR: Kind of like (inaudible at 0:18:33.0)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Was something critical goes bad.
PATIENT: Yeah. There was - there really was.
COUNSELOR: I don't know why she would.
PATIENT: It's not like her - she's doesn't feel anything as far as anybody or anything (inaudible at 0:18:46.5) well go to hell she wouldn't go with (inaudible at 0:18:48.3); but it's really not like her. I thought, well she - I knew she didn't like Jen but I thought Jen is still her friend. She's not even in the half (ph) you know.' She doesn't want to see her again.
COUNSELOR: You know sometimes people (inaudible at 0:19:06.6) family (inaudible at 0:19:08.4) extend themselves (inaudible at 0:19:14.3) exceptional (inaudible at 0:19:17.1)
PATIENT: Yeah, but not for Tanya. Well I guess she would (Crosstalk) of course I'm not real social. Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: Her father died.
PATIENT: Yeah. That's true. Maybe she felt that Jen probably would do it for her in her situation but (inaudible at 0:19:35.1) that's true. I don't know. It really bugged me think that she'd go. She doesn't even want to see her again (Chuckles). I'll have to ask Jean the same question when I see her again. She went too - she was there. I'll have to ask her the same question it would be interesting to see her reaction. On the way by my folks house afterwards and they - my mother had a shower for my cousin and it was everything - everybody was practically had gone home and we stopped by. But my cousin was there; one of my cousins whose really kind of an ass she really is but - and her husband whose really kind of an ass too but - and her husband has - he really - Tanya said — she was like he's got - he seems to be mentally deficient and he does but - and Tanya couldn't control herself and -
COUNSELOR: And she couldn't control?
PATIENT: No! You know like -
COUNSELOR: She was really (inaudible at 0:21:22.1)
PATIENT: Yeah she was kind of laughing and -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:21:26.7)
PATIENT: But he said something; well of course I know him — I don't know him but I've been around him before and I know what he's like and I've never experienced it first time maybe. I don't know. But she was just (Chuckle) she — a couple of cracks that she came out with were really uncalled for and she said she was sorry about it but she said it like — she said it was really funny but I thought to myself -
COUNSELOR: She just couldn't control herself.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I said, "Didn't - it is my cousin and he just -
COUNSELOR: Sometimes kind of like her acting out just really kind of -
PATIENT: Yeah. It really -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:04.2) really
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:05.4) like it's too much for you.
PATIENT: Right. It really is. I mean, I'm not going to go around and laugh at her cousin or something if they're a little weird. I'm not going to say anything and just for the fact that you're in someone else's home and you don't know who they are or you've never met them before. But it was really - it was kind of - I really didn't like it at all.
COUNSELOR: Kind of pissed you.
PATIENT: Yeah. It really did (Crosstalk) and I don't like the law but uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:22:38.9)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. But you have to - well when we sat down and they had left, my cousins, I thought - and my - with just my parents and I and Tanya who were there. And she was very polite and, of course, she would never offend my parents (inaudible at 0:23:04.0)
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: (inaudible at 0:23:05.5) of course you know she knows my parents; she likes them. So (inaudible at 0:23:12.0) and then I'd said my parents and I we had planned to go to California and all that stuff this summer and I was talking to - I called my cousin while I was there and she said she had this [cute thingy] (ph) we might have this six-bedroom place and on the beach and I said, "Tanya why don't you come out (inaudible at 0:23:35.5) ?" and she says, " Well (inaudible at 0:23:37.8)" We were going to leave on the 14th and she gets back on the back of the 16th or 17th." Something like that — August. Yeah. But she would - I really like her to come -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:23:48.7) want her there?
PATIENT: Yeah. I would like her to come. I don't know if she will or not. At least I extended the invitation (inaudible at 0:23:57.7). At least she knows now that I would want her to come if nothing else.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like saying a whole lot more things that you're feeling.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: One thing -
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: Then saying that you'd like her to come to (inaudible at 0:24:10.5) there -
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:24:11.1)
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:24:11.0) telling you or sharing with your feelings about -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Feeling anxious about sleeping with her-
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: Like your saying, "What's your feeling on this —"
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. (Chuckles). I was going to, of course, I wouldn't say anything to her about her when she pisses me off about - when her attitudes -
COUNSELOR: You don't say anything?
PATIENT: Yeah. I don't say anything then, no, I feel like I should.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It's like you feel like you should feel to say, "You know what? It kind of bothered me."
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: Because if you don't those kind of things accumulate.
PATIENT: That's true too. (inaudible at 0:24:56.8). Everything's going so well I should keep my mouth shut. Why start a hassle now? But I really thought that I should especially about Jen.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:25:13.0)
PATIENT: Yeah. Especially about Jen.
COUNSELOR: Is that really did piss you?
PATIENT: Yeah. That really did irk me. But every time that I know of the last time we talked about her it ended up in a big fight.
COUNSELOR: You just really want to avoid a (inaudible at 0:25:33.1)
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:25:33.6) pissed off -
PATIENT: Yeah . Right, right about what is your attitude towards her. Of course, at that time, when we had discussed it before she thought Jen was more of a - like she was jealous of Jen. But now I don't know why she would be. She knows that I love her and everything and I told her everything now but- I don't know why she would be now but - and the discussion the topic of marriage is coming up again.
COUNSELOR: How? 0:26:20.0
PATIENT: Oh, she wants to get married like now. (Chuckles)
COUNSELOR: To you?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like now.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I said, "No, I'm sorry I'm just not ready." and she says, "Well why not?" And I said, "Well I don't feel that I'm really ready. It really frightens me if you want to know the truth" Well it frightens everybody. Anybody who's ever even thought about it — it's a very frightening thing and she really kind of understood how I felt but she feels kind of the same way. When you really think about it and then she says something about well I said, "When you think about living with this person for the rest of your life." Well she goes, "Well you know for the rest of your life may be tomorrow who knows." And I said, "Well maybe but chances are it's probably longer than you've already lived so I'm taking it there."
COUNSELOR: (Crosstalk) she wants to get married right now?
PATIENT: Um, no. I didn't ask her.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:27:25.4) quiet
PATIENT: (Chuckles). Really. I don't know. Because it's true. I could see why she would want to get married. I guess I just presumed that all women want to get married.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:27:51.6)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Maybe I never really - it never really entered my mind, well, why do you want to get married?
COUNSELOR: It just seemed kind of natural that she would.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It just -
COUNSELOR: It should be (inaudible at 0:28:03.1)
PATIENT: (Chuckles) Yeah. Right. That they just want to get married. (Chuckle)
COUNSELOR: It's a good question.
PATIENT: Really. And when I saw Jen and it was really - I really wanted to say - tell Jen that I was involved with Tanya and all this stuff and she says to me, and Tanya and Sara were sitting there so she couldn't talk, (Chuckles). And she said something, "Why didn't you call?" "Gee Jen I don't know." And it was an awkward situation, her father's dead, and why didn't I call? And so, "Gee Jen, I really don't know." She says, "Did you get tied up? And I said, "Yeah Jen, I got tied up." and she goes, "Really tied up, huh?" and I said, "Yeah Jen I did." And this is the type of a person that Jen is; she knows.
COUNSELOR: She knows what's happening.
PATIENT: She knows what's happening. She's very observant and she knows what's happening and she kind of looked at me with this like a, I don't know if she was really happy about the whole thing, and she says, "Well that's nice."
COUNSELOR: Like she understood (Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. She really did and that's the type of person she is.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:25.8)
PATIENT: She's really perceptive and a very understanding person and I (inaudible at 0:29:32.7) "Okay Jen, lets step out I want to talk to you." But then (Chuckle) and that would have been it right then and there.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:40.5) would've liked to have talked to her?
PATIENT: Oh I really would have liked to have talked to her.
COUNSELOR: With Sara and Tanya there -
PATIENT: Yeah, just don't say anything around -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:29:48.1) (Crosstalk) hands tied.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. I think right away �there she goes again' as far as Jen is concerned; again off with some man that's the first thing they think of, you know, slut. (Chuckle). I didn't - I know Jen has slept with men and I just that's her business.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:30:14.3) it's not like you value -
PATIENT: No. I'm not going to say; "Well so this is the way she is" I'm not going to say anything. She is really is observant.
COUNSELOR: And you kind of liked (inaudible at 0:30:38.2) really liked before that (inaudible at 0:30:40.9)
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: The way feels kind of (inaudible at 0:30:44.0) understood me - (Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Right. Really. She could - she's the type of person you could really talk to. Sit down and talk to and she'd really understand she really would no matter what. And she kind of really gets that feeling when you're with her.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like I said maybe this is the only way she reacts towards men; she turns women off. I don't know. And I thought this weekend, also, about as far as the question of marriage is concerned I thought if I marry Tanya I have to tell her about my homosexual activities and all that stuff and the more I get involved in everything the less I want to tell her I -
COUNSELOR: Because it doesn't seem important to tell her I guess?
PATIENT: Yeah. Really. It doesn't but then I think it would be only right for me to tell her.
COUNSELOR: Kind of feel some kind of moral obligation?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right to tell her but then I think how would I tell her? Walking up the aisle are you going to say, (Chuckles) "Well guess what, you know."
COUNSELOR: Just like you can't see yourself telling her?
PATIENT: No. I can't. I really can't. No.
COUNSELOR: And it's like you can't see yourself doing it but yet you wished you didn't feel this kind of moral thing that you had to. You felt like (inaudible at 0:32:13.4)
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Yeah. Maybe I've been reading too many Ann Landers or something (Chuckle) I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Say it all.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. You have to say it all. Everything is based on trust and you don't keep anything from your wife or your husband or whoever. You should just say it all. I don't know if - (Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: It's only (inaudible at 0:32:30.8) all of its important for you to say it all.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Do you see what I mean?
PATIENT: Uh-huh. 0:32:39.3
COUNSELOR: It's not important for her because she doesn't know if she heard it all or not.
PATIENT: That's true too. Yeah.
COUNSELOR: So it's really only kind of the way you psychologically feel.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: With it (inaudible at 0:32:51.7) Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah. Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: And it kind of sounds like you kind of feel like you should.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: If she did (inaudible at 0:33:01.0)
PATIENT: Yeah. One way I think I should and another way I think I shouldn't. So if she does know or what she knows just leave it at that and say okay just forget it and then in another way I just think well I really should. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Why do you feel like you don't want to?
PATIENT: Because I'm - it's something that I am ashamed of and -
COUNSELOR: And she'll kind of think bad of you?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:33:35.6) nice you don't want to throw it -
PATIENT: Throw it out. Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:33:39.8) missed it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. I don't know if anything like marriage being such an important step that everything is - you're supposed to know everything about everybody and everything about their past and all this stuff. I don't know. If somebody were to tell me, "Yes, you should" I probably would.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh. If you really feel that much inside then you should.
PATIENT: Yeah. Probably.
COUNSELOR: A little bit more (Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Yes, you should tell her, yeah, and I probably would but -
COUNSELOR: But you don't want to?
PATIENT: No I don't. I'm afraid to.
COUNSELOR: That's - what is - you don't want to because you're frightened a little (inaudible at 0:34:36.4)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. I'm and I'm afraid what her reaction might be and all those stuff.
COUNSELOR: She might (inaudible at 0:34:41.2) horrible reaction (inaudible at 0:34:43.2)
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
COUNSELOR: This is the end.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. And it's like even when a subject is brought up I just kind of go like, �Oh God!' and maybe - I don't know if she notices my reaction or - we were sitting, the other night in a restaurant, and a couple booths over something like that you know there's three guys and one guy she says, "He really did look like (inaudible at 0:35:06.2) there's three gay birds" and all this stuff and I just felt like -
COUNSELOR: Horror.
PATIENT: Yeah. I just felt like �oh. So what' I just probably felt like telling her �so what?'
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like a derogatory (inaudible at 0:35:23.7) kind of like -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That could be directed towards you (inaudible at 0:35:26.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Oh, and there's another guy and she goes and he stood up and she goes, "Well you couldn't tell with about him but it wouldn't take long" or something like this. I thought �Oh wow!' (Chuckle). Really.
COUNSELOR: And like she kind of says those kinds of derogatory things about homosexuals.
PATIENT: That's why I feel if she knew.
COUNSELOR: If she knew she'd -
PATIENT: If she knew that I'd -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:35:52.8)
PATIENT: Yeah. If — no - if she knew that if she had any kind of inkling that I had had some homosexual activity, why would she say something like that if she knew that it was going to hit me?
COUNSELOR: Yeah. Right. And she (inaudible at 0:36:07.1) then she wouldn't. Right and that kind of makes it - you feel like she doesn't (inaudible at 0:36:12.7)
PATIENT: She doesn't know she doesn't even have any idea because if she did I don't think she'd say anything about them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. It makes a lot of sense.
PATIENT: Really.
COUNSELOR: Unless she's incredibly Catholic.
PATIENT: That's true too (Chuckle). I don't know.
COUNSELOR: But there are just some things that you do impact (inaudible at 0:36:30.8)
PATIENT: Right. Alright then I thought to myself if she does know she's pointing out the fact that would you look at them how queer they are.
COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 0:36:47.6)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. (Chuckle). I thought about it and, no, I don't think she'd say that. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: I mean, is it kind of very roundabout way of saying?
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Saying that �look at them you don't want to be like them' or something like that. But I think she's really -
COUNSELOR: Are there things you (inaudible at 0:37:13.2) complications (inaudible at 0:37:14.6)
PATIENT: That's right. (Chuckle)
COUNSELOR: Would she know and if she has no inkling and she says these things my gosh you realize - really try to (inaudible at 0:37:23.5) think of you telling her she might what the hell (inaudible at 0:37:26.9) you could have a horrible comment -
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Like here you see kind of like things just look different. There's a good prospect of telling her that you like being with her and real possibility of something it's just like saying something and you could risk all that.
PATIENT: I guess that's another reason why I just couldn't tell her (inaudible at 0:37:52.4) I don't know, but then I think to myself well what if she saw somebody who I at one time, some guy, who I one time had been in bed with or something like this (Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: In your wildest dreams (inaudible at 0:38:13.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right .
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:14.1) her finding out.
PATIENT: Yeah. Right of her finding out from (Crosstalk) oh it is; they're very slim. Right.
COUNSELOR: Again, it's kind of really like I'm frightened (inaudible at 0:38:21.7)
PATIENT: Yeah. Uh-huh. Really.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:38:24.1) just (inaudible at 0:38:25.4)
PATIENT: That's the truth and the truth. On Sunday morning I walked over to mass. it was really, I don't know why I went or anything. It was alright and then when it came time when everyone was going up and receiving communion and stuff like that I really I thought to myself I could really confess now and what I did and really be going in and saying the whole situation. And then I'm just I really could - I go back. It's really a good feeling like I had a choice now. Nothing that I could be afraid of because I was doing something about it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You're doing something that you kind of felt like you didn't have to stay away from the church (inaudible at 0:39:24.0)
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:39:25.9) what you would have done.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. Right.
COUNSELOR: You weren't an outcast.
PATIENT: Uh-huh. I really thought about it too and I said, "Well, hell, I can go and confess it now" and no bones about it because I'm never going to do it again so it really would be -
COUNSELOR: Over and done with.
PATIENT: Over and done with. I really - it wouldn't be like you're going to go and you're going to say it and you're going to go back and do the same thing again. So it was kind of a nice feeling to know that (Chuckle) I at least realized at that point.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:00.3)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. It wasn't all that. Well it was all that; it wasn't all that terrific.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:16.9) planning that big strong.
PATIENT: (Laughter) it was really not that terrific. It does make some kind of people (inaudible at 0:40:29.4). (Chuckle) (inaudible at 0:40:35.3) the one thing you listen for to go - well the most important thing going, for me, is listening to the sermon; what the man has to say. (inaudible at 0:40:47.5) show (inaudible at 0:40:48.5) to listen to what he has to say is kind of nice. The one priest he was spouting something off he just said so much of the stuff and so little that it was unbelievable. (Chuckle) and oh, God! It was so idealistic and all the world is new and oh, Christ! (Chuckle) It was really unbelievable. I felt like saying, "Oh, buddy where have you been?" (Chuckle) I mean he was young and ordained three years and I thought oh, God! Expounding on how beautiful everything was and -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:41:31.9)
PATIENT: Yeah. Right. Just look around you and this - but he said how, oh, the living in the [naked war] (ph) and all this stuff and blah, blah, blah but still -
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:41:47.8)
PATIENT: Right. I said, "Oh Christ!" It was just unbelievable, unreal (inaudible at 0:41:56.9) and I thought you really can't be that na�ve you really have to you have to get to know the past too (Chuckle).
COUNSELOR: About Christ.
PATIENT: Or maybe he didn't. I don't know. Me being very (inaudible at 0:42:14.1) philosophical (Chuckle) how all these kept on referring to the, how did he put it, was one of the five - the omega the land slider (ph) and the alpha and the omega (inaudible at 0:42:35.4) something about the last (inaudible at 0:42:37.6) but he was at his alpha. (Chuckle) so, wow! I just don't realize how they can come out and say something like this.
COUNSELOR: Pretty (inaudible at 0:42:58.9)
PATIENT: Yeah. It was a lot of gold shifting. it really was.
COUNSELOR: It's not like they were (Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Well I liked this with this Baptist minister, the other day who I met, and he really seemed like — and it was sad that he was quitting. He's a very funny person, funny about how - he got up and, I don't know, if he meant it to be derogatory but he did a sermon as if he were a homosexual. Like and this is the type of thing - at least he'd have an audience (Chuckle) would be captive and going up and following - he was up in the hierarchy (ph) he pretended that he fell asleep at the pulpit. Something like this and then you can really get the peoples reaction. The least they'd be there and he offered them something.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:47.3) malleable or
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:49.1)
PATIENT: Right. He'd have to go off course. He does want to go into acting, which is kind of sad. Going be up on stage every Sunday morning and people would really listen to him.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:44:06.5) he be good at it.
PATIENT: He would. He really would be good at it and it's sad that he's not doing like he - Sara said that he really freaked the pastor out. He went to the Catholic (ph) church and he went up and received communion and he looks so really Jewish (Laughter) and he got up to the communion rail and refused to be near the baby on its back and he just really psyched this man out - and this was this was a type of a person that they need someone whose really has something to offer.
COUNSELOR: Seems like kind of alive.
PATIENT: Yeah. He really is. He's very alive person, in fact, I was mentioned to Sara that I'd like to, some Sunday, I would like to go out and listen to one of his sermons and see what they're like before he quits. Of course they stuck him in he's in the (inaudible at 0:44:58.9) area too he's got like 50 parishioners and (Chuckle)
COUNSELOR: Really small.
PATIENT: Yeah. At one time it was a really a large parish and then the neighborhood changed and no one comes to the church anymore. So and it's really sad that they would stick him in a place like this where he's reaching no one and he's - that's why one of the reasons, I believe, he's leaving is because there's nothing to do. Well there is, I know, (inaudible at 0:45:30.5) what do you mean there's nothing to do? There's so much to do, but I guess in his line of work, I don't know, what there is to do (inaudible at 0:45:38.8) Sara said she was with him the other day and he stopped on the highway to help this girl change her tire from the save one soul (ph) (Laughter). He didn't even know how to change a tire (Laughter) and he has no idea that some guy on a motorcycle stopped and he let him change the tire and he took the girls red jacket and waving down (Laughter) (inaudible at 0:46:02.7).
COUNSELOR: Our times about up.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Same time Wednesday?
PATIENT: Yeah.
