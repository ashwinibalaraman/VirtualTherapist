BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> You're not a bad person.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, it -
<b>DR:</b> Ever.  Are you?
<b>PT:</b> I think.
<b>DR:</b> Bad?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, bad.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you're not a criminal, or -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Not stealing, are you?
<b>CG:</b> No, she threatens to hurt people, though.
<b>DR:</b> But she doesn't.
<b>CG:</b> She doesn't.
<b>PT:</b> That's when she, but that's back to her mood swings.
<b>CG:</b> It is.  Anybody that does one thing, especially, because, I mean she just, she comes right out.  She's going to kill them.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  That's what she might say, but she'd never do it.
<b>CG:</b> No.  I hope she wouldn't.  But she says it.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> She says it entirely too much.
<b>DR:</b> You what?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> You're saying something, I don't [INAUDIBLE].  She's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, tell me what your mood swings are like, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> I don't know what.
<b>CG:</b> Why don't we answer the questions, I can answer them, then let -
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>CG:</b> Let her talk to you about herself.  And, um, I was going to tell you about that couch, remember when [NAME OTHER] called.  I called, her mother's called, in the, before her appointments and hearing things, you know, that she would do and had done.  Then she would go and tell him the opposite, you know, that we were lying on her.  And he believed her.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what kind of problem are we having most of the day to day with, uh, [PATIENT NAME] right now?
<b>CG:</b> I would say mostly her mood swings, her, her nerves.  Her, um, anxiety attacks.  Um, she just can't deal with life.  You know, life has situations.
<b>PT:</b> I can't deal with losing my granddaddy, period.
<b>DR:</b> And you're, pretty angry about that?
<b>CG:</b> She, um -
<b>PT:</b> What, that I was not living at home that night at the time.  I was living with my daddy's home then.
<b>DR:</b> So you're feeling guilty.
<b>CG:</b> Just because she wasn't there.  And I'm glad she wasn't.  Because if she had been, she would have been at the hospital with us when it happened.  And that would have been even worse.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, what do you think would have been different if you were there?
<b>PT:</b> That's the part I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You somehow think -
<b>PT:</b> That's what I keep asking myself.
<b>DR:</b> You somehow think things might have been, ended up different?
<b>PT:</b> And then I also hold it against my family because nobody let me know until the next day.
<b>CG:</b> It happened at two something in the morning.  And we didn't get home until almost daylight.  And, um, I wouldn't go out there and wake her up and tell her that.  We just waited for her, you know, her grandmother, other grandmother [INAUDIBLE].  All I wanted, she didn't even, she did wouldn't even talk to you [INAUDIBLE].  She knew something was wrong, and when she didn't see him there, she knew.  She wouldn't talk to any of us.  It's in the house and straight up [INAUDIBLE], and gone.  She didn't, didn't stay at the house during the time before the funeral.  She would, she refused to ride in the family car to the funeral.  She, uh, I guess she just felt like if she didn't do all that it would go away, I don't know.  I mean, I'm not -
<b>DR:</b> All right.  But she's angry.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah, she was.
<b>DR:</b> Angry at the family, and -
<b>CG:</b> Well, I, you know, I was angry, too.  I mean, I, I treated the emergency room doctor really badly.  And, um, you know, I, I sent him a card later and apologized.  But you do things like that when -
<b>DR:</b> Of course.
<b>CG:</b> When you're traumatized.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're still doing it.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You really hang on to a grudge, don't you?  What do you think would have been different had you been there?
<b>PT:</b> That's what I keep asking myself.  What could I have done?
<b>DR:</b> To alter the outcome so that he would be alive?
<b>PT:</b> Either way.
<b>DR:</b> What do you, does that mean.  Either way?  What could you have possibly have done?
<b>PT:</b> Being there before he took his last breath.  Because that's what he would have wanted.  I was hard-hit.
<b>DR:</b> What does that mean?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't want to stay at home.
<b>DR:</b> Do you really think he would have wanted you there?  I've changed -
<b>CG:</b> I don't think he would have wanted her there at that time.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> I tell you, [INAUDIBLE] too much.  He would not have wanted her there with what happened then.
<b>DR:</b> Put yourself in his position, would you want someone that, you were dying like that, would you want someone there that loved you and that you loved?  Would you want them to see that, and that be the last memory?  No.  What makes you think he would want that for you?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  Just because we were so close.
<b>DR:</b> And that was good.  I knew you were close.  But when you're taking you last breath, it'd different.
<b>CG:</b> When you were very close.  [INAUDIBLE].  We did everything together.
<b>DR:</b> You know, if you've, if you've been around pain.
<b>PT:</b> I even slept in bed with my granddaddy until I turned [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> That was then, though.  He wasn't dying then.  People often die in the middle of the night when there's nobody around.  They often will die after everybody leaves.  I think there's a reason for that.  It's not something that you want your loved ones to remember.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> I've tried to talk to her, but I didn't, my, um, when, um, my son died, [INAUDIBLE].  Oh, he died at work.  But it was in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I went to [DEIDENTIFIED] because his wife had called and said they had taken him to the hospital.  And then when I got there and they wanted to know if I wanted to see him, and I did.  But I wish that I hadn't.  And, um, because that's not the way I wanted to remember him.  That memory is stuck in my mind forever.
<b>DR:</b> That's sad.
<b>CG:</b> It will be there until the day I die.
<b>DR:</b> It's burned in there, isn't it?
<b>CG:</b> Yes.  It will not go away.  And, uh, the night that my husband, morning that my husband died and they wanted to know if I wanted to go back there, and I said no.  I wanted to remember him the way he was the last time I saw him.  When they took him down for an x-ray.  I didn't want to go back in there and look at him like that.  And that's something, it's what she don't understand.  There's some pictures that are etched in your memory that you wish you could wash them out like you'd wash everything else.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> And the picture of my son after he was dead, I do not want to remember, and I cannot forget.
<b>DR:</b> Does that make any sense to you?  I truly don't think he would have wanted you there.
<b>PT:</b> Probably.
<b>DR:</b> Not if, not if he loved you.
<b>CG:</b> And he did.
<b>DR:</b> And that would be -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What you're, what she's describing is a pleasant event, seeing her son?  No.  It's a traumatic event.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That even though it's her son, she would like that memory to be gone.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Why would we wish that on you?
<b>PT:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE].  No.  [CRYING].  But you don't know.
<b>DR:</b> That's your guilt feelings.  They're not unusual.  And you not went to the emergency room, you'd feel bad at not having gone.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just because that's the thing to do.
<b>CG:</b> As far as getting over losing someone, you never get over it.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> It gets easier as time goes by.
<b>PT:</b> It's the way you do it.
<b>CG:</b> But you never get over it.  But here, for her, like she just said it.  It's not getting easier for her.
<b>PT:</b> It's getting harder.
<b>CG:</b> And, uh, you know, I didn't think I would get over my son dying.  I wanted to die.
<b>PT:</b> Hum.
<b>CG:</b> I did not want to go on living without him.
<b>PT:</b> And that's why I don't want any counseling.  I remember I went to him so many times and told him I wanted to die, and I wanted to kill myself.  And right here on my arm where I done cut myself, and he still wouldn't do nothing for me, the doctor.
<b>DR:</b> What do you want done for you, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> He wasn't doing anything.
<b>DR:</b> What do you want?  Do you know what you want?
<b>PT:</b> He would talk to me and say, and didn't even tell my grandma all I wanted was attention.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> I wasn't going to do it, or some stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what is it that you need?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I need help dealing with this.
<b>CG:</b> He didn't, he, actually he never would talk to me.  I mean, you know, after their sessions.  Uh, I didn't say he didn't tell me everything she said, because I know how that is.  They, any of them.  But, um -
<b>DR:</b> But the talking is, that he had an idea that you needed to be talking to other people, too.  It's the same thing.  It's expressing your feelings in an appropriate manner.
<b>PT:</b> Well, why, when you got somebody that you know is not listening to you, you're not going to open up to them.
<b>DR:</b> Well, who do you talk to now?
<b>PT:</b> Nobody.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Because I feel like he didn't listen to me, so who else is going to listen?
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Doesn't she listen?
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.  Yeah, I would, but she won't talk to me.
<b>DR:</b> Isn't she -
<b>PT:</b> But I don't open up to her.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I just don't open up to her.
<b>CG:</b> She would tell more to my son [INAUDIBLE] than she would to me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's two people I hear that you can talk to.  Who else?
<b>PT:</b> My momma.  I open up to her sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> You've got three people.
<b>CG:</b> Like her mom is in worse shape than she is.
<b>PT:</b> But I feel like, if I keep on going like this, I'll be in the same shape that she's in.
<b>DR:</b> If you continue to keep all these feelings in and don't talk about them, you mean?
<b>CG:</b> Yes, it does hurt.  My son that died was her mother's father.  And she's never gotten over it.
<b>DR:</b> You know, I don't think she does this for attention, but I do think that, [PATIENT NAME], you hang on to this, these feelings for a reason.  And if, it's not going to be, is she talk about things that upset and bother you, because the more you talk about it, the better you're going to feel.  That's what your grandmother's telling you.  She's telling you that it's very hard when you lose someone.  But the more you talk about it, you feel bad after it at first, I agree.  You feel bad anyway.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  And I'm usually over to the graveyard every day, and then I quit going after coming to see you last time.  And you told me not to go back.  And now I feel like -
<b>DR:</b> Feel like you should go?  You feel like what?
<b>PT:</b> I just feel like I have abandoned him, I should go over there every day.
<b>DR:</b> But you, yourself, said he's not there.
<b>CG:</b> We should go back to the, uh, morning she came in the house after he had passed away.  When she didn't speak to anybody and didn't say a word.
<b>PT:</b> I did.  I went in the kitchen and talked to [NAME OTHER], and he's the one that told me.
<b>CG:</b> She didn't cry.  And crying is a part of grieving.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I didn't start crying until, until it hit me.  And I was the one who went and made his funeral arrangements.
<b>DR:</b> You cry much now?
<b>PT:</b> Every day, every night.
<b>DR:</b> Do you write down much in your feelings journal?
<b>CG:</b> And she's got a journal, too.
<b>DR:</b> So the first step is getting the stuff out of your head and seeing what we've got, isn't it?  And the more you talk to people in your family that love you, the better.  Get your journal out and do some writing.  That's what I was getting, here.  A journal will help you.  Write some things that would help me to be able to help you.  Medicine can play a role, [PATIENT NAME].  I don't have a medicine that's going to fix you, though.  I don't have a medicine that's going to bring anybody back from the dead.  I don't have any medicine that can reverse what's happened in the past.  Medicine can only help some symptoms, that can get rid of those.  And maybe then you can do the stuff you have to do, which is get this stuff out of your head and figure out how you're going to deal with it.
<b>CG:</b> We have to get her on the right track, because I'm [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>CG:</b> I'm not going to live forever.
<b>DR:</b> But she's the one that has to do this.  We can help you and support you, but you've got to make -
<b>CG:</b> That's right.  Until she gets -
<b>DR:</b> Some stride.
<b>CG:</b> Where she can handle stuff like this, what's she going to do if something happens to me?
<b>DR:</b> That's her fear.  I mean that's her biggest fear.  It's not what's happened in the past so much as it is what may happen in the future.
<b>PT:</b> There is no telling what I would probably do.
<b>CG:</b> She's going to not know.  She cannot even answer this to get her driver's permit.
<b>PT:</b> Well, because my nerves have been so shot.  I'm steady shaking all over.  My insides are constantly in a knot, I can't do anything.
<b>CG:</b> And we, uh, my, my, she studied the book but she hasn't got it -
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] -
<b>CG:</b> Someone sit down with her.
<b>PT:</b> And I got everything right.  Every question he asked me.
<b>CG:</b> And did, you know, give her like a 30-minute crash course before she went over there and she still failed it for the third time.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we, um, I mean, here for the mood problems.  And there are sometime we certainly need to look at addressing that.  It's not just your anxiety.
<b>CG:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE] take what I need.  Uh -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  Using [INAUDIBLE] next year.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Maybe that's a good thing.
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What other, um, I know she's been on a number of different medicines over the years.  What other, uh, has she been okay Depakote?
<b>CG:</b> Um, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Lithium?
<b>CG:</b> No, that no.
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal?  She's been on Zoloft at one time.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And, um, you've been on Prozac and Paxil.  I think any of those kind of drugs?
<b>CG:</b> I don't think so.  I don't to take a chance on putting her on nothing that would make, some of those antidepressants I know, can cause suicidal feelings.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have any of those?
<b>CG:</b> I don't want to take a chance.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have suicidal thoughts now?
<b>PT:</b> But I used to.
<b>DR:</b> Well.  Yeah, I know we dealt with -
<b>CG:</b> I just thought she said that one, when she takes the Klonopin it helps her right then.
<b>PT:</b> But then they wear off.
<b>DR:</b> They will in six hours, thereabout.  They only last -
<b>PT:</b> Well, they weren't, they -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] for her.
<b>DR:</b> Again, you said originally wanted Klonopin, you said you took them before and they helped, right?  But they're not now?  So we need to find, or stop those, try something different.  Xanax helps other people that Klonopin doesn't help.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm willing to try anything to, I mean, I, I can be sitting in -
<b>DR:</b> Or Ativan.  Have you taken that?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  I can't take Ativan.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> Because it makes me sick.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, you've not taken -
<b>PT:</b> They gave it to me at the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Have you taken Xanax?
<b>PT:</b> One night.
<b>DR:</b> Or [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they gave me a Xanax at the hospital after they gave me the Ativan and it made me sick.  She made them leave me lay there for an hour, and then they gave me a Xanax and then they made me sit there 30 minutes to make it wouldn't make me sick, and then I left.
<b>DR:</b> So Xanax -
<b>PT:</b> And I did feel better.
<b>DR:</b> What Neurontin?  Have you ever taken that?  Or gabapentin?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what we'll, what we'll probably want to do with this is give her something to help her even her mood.  That would be like a Neurontin that helps, a script for anxiety and you take it a few times a day.  And then you take the Xanax as needed in addition to that.
<b>CG:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because I'm actually -
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Two medicines.  One as needed, one regularly.  What I want to be careful of, too, is not giving her medicines that will increase your appetite.  So many of these medicines -
<b>CG:</b> She don't have no appetite.
<b>PT:</b> I don't eat.  Wait, I eat this morning because I was hungry this morning.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because I didn't eat all day yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I, I didn't want, I ate this morning, but I won't eat the rest of the day.
<b>CG:</b> And sometimes she won't eat -
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I won't eat all day.
<b>CG:</b> Until late at night, and then she's getting hungry.  This is not good.
<b>DR:</b> Got the same boyfriend?
<b>CG:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You had a boyfriend last time I saw you.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> Have you got the same boyfriend?  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Where'd he go?  Did you break it off?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not seeing anybody right now.  I've got to, I've got to worry about me first.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  What are you going to do this summer?  You guys getting away, or?
<b>PT:</b> Hopefully, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> We're trying to get [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] calls me for the AM/PM in the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> A lot of -
<b>PT:</b> Going to work.
<b>DR:</b> Where?
<b>PT:</b> A convenience store.
<b>CG:</b> Again, we'll discuss that [INAUDIBLE].  You want to talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME] about anything else today?
