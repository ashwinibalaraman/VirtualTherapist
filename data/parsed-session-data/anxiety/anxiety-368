I had spent three sleepless nights. The third night was the
worst. I lay awake, fearful and tense. I was suspended in
never-never land where eyelids seemed propped open. I
would never live through another night of this.


Flashlights shone in my face. My pulse was taken from
time to time. I felt myself really in a madhouse. The sickness
which had claimed only a portion of my personality was
now claiming all of it, I was quite sure. Toward morning a
nurse came to sit on my bed.


"Tm dying," I told her. "Will you notify my husband?"


"Dr. Schoen will be in to talk to you later."


"Do you know that I used to look like you?" I said,

When Dr. Schoen left I felt somewhat better. When the
breakfast bell rang I managed to put on my clothing, and
went into breakfast with the other patients.


A few days later I was to be sent downstairs with the socalled
"incurables," for I had been unable to maintain my
place in the third-floor ward.
