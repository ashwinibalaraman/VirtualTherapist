<font size="4"><b>Chapter 3: Psychophysiological Foundations of the Mind-Body Therapies</b></font>
[p. <i>43</i>]

<b>Abstract:</b> The health care provider in a primary care setting frequently encounters patients with
comorbid emotional and physical problems. The presence of chronic stress, mood or anxiety
disorders, and personality characteristics complicates diagnosis and interferes with management and
compliance. Models have been proposed to explain the mediation of the effects of stress via the
nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Intervention by primary care providers can be office based
or by referral and may vary from short-term to complex, ongoing therapy. Effects of mind-body
therapies are based on solid psychophysiological data and are well suited to the problems seen in
patients in primary care practice.

<b>Comorbidity of Emotional and Physical Illness</b>

Mental and emotional illnesses are very common
in the primary care sector and affect
every aspect of physical illnesses. The presence
of mood and anxiety disorders as well
as subclinical anxiety and depression prevent
patients from reaching optimal quality of life
(Spitzer et al., 1995). Chronic pain is also a
frequent complaint of people seeking services
in primary care. The transformation of an
acute, time-limited, curable illness into a
chronic problem depends more on psychosocial
factors than it does on physical variables.
Frequency, severity, and chronicity of illness
influence patients' needs for services and the
time spent in managing them when they are
ill (Sullivan, Turner, &amp; Romano, 1991).


Patients suffering with mood or anxiety
disorders and functional impairments are
more likely to be considered difficult by primary
care physicians than are patients with
the same degree of severity of physical illness
but no emotional problems (Hahn et al.,
1996). Difficult relationships in the primary
care setting lead to unmet expectations and
affect utilization of services (Kroenke,
Jackson, &amp; Chamberlin, 1997). For example,
the number of physical problems reported on
the PRIME-MD questionnaire was correlated
with the number of phone calls to the
office and the perceived difficulty of the
encounter from the physician's perspective
(Wahl, McGrady, Lynch, &amp; Nagel, 2000).
Patients who demonstrated a tendency to
somatize psychological distress had higher
negative affect, were more focused on

[p. <i>44</i>]

The diagnosis of chronic illness, even
when the prognosis is good, is associated
with an emotional reaction. During acuity or
when complications from a chronic illness
develop, the patient grieves about actual or
perceived loss of physical abilities and faces
increased difficulty in maintaining his or her
usual roles. The patient's emotional response
to illness affects family members and interpersonal
relationships (Brenner, 1997). Yet
too often the physician focuses predominantly
on treating the physical aspects of the
illness to the detriment of assessing and managing
the emotional accompaniments.


Despite the high prevalence of emotional
disorders in patients seeking primary care
services, symptoms of anxiety or depression
are often not reported, and when verbalized,
not recognized or adequately treated. On the
other hand, the presence of medically unexplained
symptoms or hypochondriasis increases
the rate of recognition of emotional
illness by physicians (Kirmayer, Robbins,
Dworkind, &amp; Yaffe, 1993). Histories of
traumatic life events are not uncommon in
primary care patients but are often poorly
assessed. In a recent study, the 10 percent of
primary care patients who had experienced
traumatic events during the past year were
more likely to have psychiatric disorders and
also used more medical services than patients
without these experiences (Holman, Silver, &amp;
Waitzkin, 2000).


What are the factors that influence the
inadequate reporting and identification of
emotional illness in primary care? For a
chronic-pain patient, disclosure is affected by
perceived stigma, the effect of pain on memory,
and the physician's ability to elicit the
information. Pain interferes with the ability to
focus and learn, so instructions may not be
remembered or understood (Kuhajda, Thorn,
&amp; Klinger, 1998). The patient's willingness to
exhibit illness behavior resulting from pain as
well as emotional distress is affected by his or
her prediction of the physician's reaction to
this display.


Primary care practitioners are accustomed
to observing the behaviors that accompany
physical illness, such as the person with back
pain moving more slowly and stiffly.
Similarly, the appearance and actions of a
person with depression or anxiety can provide
clues to a diagnosis (Lewis &amp; Lubkin,
1998). Behavioral indicators of morbidity
resulting from disturbances of mood, such as
days of work missed, less frequent church
attendance, and fewer social events attended,
also provide important indicators of emotional
distress.


To illustrate further, emotional and social
factors are very important in the management
of obese persons, who are criticized by society,
their peers, and health care providers. An
obese patient's disclosure of depressive symptoms
may be thwarted by the provider's
exclusive focus on the obesity. Subsequently,
poor compliance is attributed solely to
unwillingness to change, whereas depression
is actually preventing such healthy behaviors.
Certainly, the obese person with depression is
unlikely to fulfill behavior requirements for
weight loss (Clark, Niaura, King, &amp; Para,
1996). On the other hand, the person who
loses weight successfully usually demonstrates
a decrease in depressive symptoms
and improvement in self-esteem (Devlin,
Yanovski, &amp; Wilson, 2000).

<b>The Role of Emotional Stress in the Development and Maintenance of Physical Disorders</b>
[p. <i>45</i>]

Stress increases the intensity of physical
symptoms and lowers the threshold for
seeking medical help. Repeated stress makes
people more likely to conclude that ill-defined
or vague bodily sensations are due to physical
disease. Interpretation of symptoms such
as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or mild gastrointestinal
disruptions as "sickness" facilitates
the identification of oneself as "sick."
The sick role with its attendant behaviors is
more easily accepted over time (Barsky &amp;
Borus, 1999). Individuals appraise potentially
stress-inducing situations and assess
their ability to manage or control the stress.
If demand exceeds perceived capability, the
stress response ensues (Lazarus &amp; Folkman,
1984). Successful adaptation means that
each Stressor is countered in a timely manner
and without long-term damage.


Individuals are equipped with complex,
overlapping, yet distinct behavioral and physiological
stress response systems. As Dantzer
(1991) summarizes, a pathogen, a predator,
and a poison have nothing in common except
that they disrupt normal psychophysiological
functioning, so the responses to those three
Stressors will involve different systems. In contrast,
Barsky and Borus (1999) maintain that
persons with functional somatic syndromes
(which may result from chronic stress) share
many symptoms, such as unexplained physical
distress, fatigue, sleeplessness, and elevated
rates of psychiatric disorders.


The ability to respond and to achieve stability
through change is referred to as allostasis.
Instead of the narrow normal range limits
of homeostatic systems, allostatic systems
function under more varied conditions, allowing
individuals to cope and readjust without
long-term harm. Load on the system results
from chronic overactivity or underactivity of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that
normally protects the body from the effects of
stressful events. Individual differences in
response are due to genetic predisposition,
past experience, and the person's perception
of the event (McEwen, 1998). Cacioppo et al.
(2000) studied the physiological and psychological
characteristics of persons who care for
their spouses with dementia to elucidate the
effects of high allostatic load on function.
(<i>Allostatic load</i> here means the total burden
on the individual for adaptation and coping.)
Higher levels of baseline sympathetic tone and
plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone, as
well as more depressive symptoms and poorer
immune function, were observed.


The physiological effects of stress are mediated
by the central, autonomic, endocrine, and
immune systems. Hyperactivity of the sympathoadrenal
system is associated with increased
heart rate and blood pressure, decreased heart
rate variability, and impaired digestion. Stress
also predisposes susceptible individuals to
obesity. When the body's fight-or-flight
response is triggered, hunger and appetite
for carbohydrates ensues because the hypothalamus
anticipates an expenditure of calories
following the stress stimulus. Ingestion of
carbohydrates triggers the release of serotonin,
which is associated with decreased
negative affect. Overeating in stressful circumstances
is reinforced by positive sensations
such as fullness and a more positive mood
(Goodnick, Henry, &amp; Buki, 1995).


Common central nervous system pathways
mediate stress-induced disruptions of
behavioral and emotional homeostasis. The
cells of the nervous, endocrine, and immune
systems communicate via neurotransmitters
and neuropeptides (nervous), hormones
(endocrine), and cytokines (immune).
Communication is bidirectional between the
nervous and immune systems. Sympathetic
fibers innervate both primary and secondary

[p. <i>46</i>]

One of the by-products of negative mood is
observed in the ability of the immune system
to respond to stress (Kemeny &amp; Miller, 1999).
The immune system is capable of a relatively
rapid response, but most effects take hours or
days. Depending on the individual's perception
of the severity of the threat and past success
at coping with the same Stressor, the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the
sympathetic nervous system will be activated
to a lesser or greater degree, with resulting
immunological sequelae (Maier, Watkins, &amp;
Fleshner, 1994). For example, the person who
undergoes chronic stress shows inhibition of
the delayed hypersensitivity response. One of
the many consequences of this is an increased
sensitivity to the common cold. In contrast,
more frequent social contacts lessen the
impact of the stress response on the immune
system and decrease the frequency of colds in
an otherwise healthy population (Cohen,
Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, &amp; Gwaltney, 1997).


Interrelationships among the immune and
cardiovascular systems under stressful conditions
are common (Cacioppo, 1994; Skinner,
1991). Normal levels of cortisol can raise
blood pressure, and stress-induced higher
levels of cortisol can produce sustained elevations
of blood pressure (Walker, Unützer,
&amp; Katon, 1998). Adrenergic receptors are
sensitized by cortisol so that low levels of
catecholamines can produce a hyperarousal
response (Nelesen &amp; Dimsdale, 1994).
Constantly reliving a traumatic event is
similar to the effects of such an event being
prolonged and represents a chronic stress to
the nervous, cardiovascular, and immune
systems. Besides the resulting increased blood
pressure and heart rate, the fibrinogen system
is more reactive during stress, and this
reactivity is associated with increased risk of
myocardial infarction.


Low blood pressure that occurs during
stressful situations is as maladaptive a
response as continued high blood pressure
after the stress is removed. In susceptible individuals,
emotional distress initially produces a
strong sympathetic response followed by
paradoxical withdrawal of adrenergic activity.
Blood pressure decreases abruptly, and
the person faints. Patients with autonomic
dysfunction usually present with complaints
of fatigue, dizziness, and negative mood, similar
to many other illnesses. In fact, there is a
high degree of comorbidity between syncope
and depression. Therefore, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors are frequent choices for
treatment of these patients (Kosinski &amp;
Grubb, 1994). In the animal world, hyporesponsiveness
in the face of stress is sometimes
the best adaptive choice. Bradycardia in the
hog-nosed snake that feigns death and in the
iguana immobilized by fear permits these animals
to be protected from predators. In mammals,
reflex bradycardia reduces oxygen
resources and metabolic output; the traditional
fight-or-flight response is reduced in
favor of the freeze response (Porges, 1995).
Nonetheless, syncope as an adaptive response
to stress in humans is difficult to understand.


Psychiatric disorders are commonly associated
with cortisol dysregulation. In particular,
failure of inhibition of the normal feedback
system for cortisol is a hallmark of depressive
disorders. On the contrary, patients with posttraumatic
stress disorder have reduced cortisol
levels, perhaps due to neuroanatomical
changes resulting from extreme psychological
stress (Yehuda et al., 1990). Cortisol inhibits
serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine,
neurotransmittors that normally maintain

<b>Mind-Body Models Applicable to Primary Care</b>

The diagnosis and management of emotional
disorders in primary care must be improved.
Physicians and other primary care practitioners
can increase their efficiency of handling
stress-related emotional disorders through
training, education, and on-site consultation
with behavioral health consultants. Several
interventions to improve physician awareness
of mood and anxiety disorders have been
tested in a primary care setting. These include
providing screening tools to identify depression
and anxiety, giving feedback of symptom
scores, and videotaping encounters between
depressed patients and physicians and providing
feedback. The use of more intensive training
for providers than a single continuing
medical education (CME) lecture format has
been supported (Kroenke, Taylor-Vaisey,
Dietrich, &amp; Oxman, 2000). In addition,
patients who are currently well but want to
decrease their risk and request methods to do
so must be taken seriously. Often patients
who ask for risk-reduction interventions are
dismissed with vague recommendations to
"exercise and watch what you eat."


<b><i>Wellness Checkups</i></b>


Box 3.1 presents the format for an assessment
of well patients that can help physicians
identify potential or developing problems.
Short questionnaires such as the PRIME-MD
and the Life Events Scale (LES) can be used
while patients wait to be seen for wellness
checkups. The LES in particular tells the
physician what major events the patient has
experienced in the past year: this information
facilitates the encounter (Miller &amp; Rahe,
1997). With these simple tools, the physician
is prepared to ask the appropriate questions
during the visit and can allot time to relevant

<b><i>Visits for Chronic Illness</i></b>


Box 3.2 provides the format for a more
detailed investigation of emotional factors
that may be increasing the severity of the illness
or impeding compliance in a patient
with chronic illness. Again, short questionnaires
may be used to inform the physician
about changes in activities. Any indication of
incipient mood or anxiety disorders can be
investigated with self-report paper-and-pencil
inventories and followed up with longer
assessment tools or referral if necessary.


Illness conviction (the person's belief that
there is something wrong and what is wrong
must be fixed by medical intervention) must
be considered and acknowledged in a person
with persistent illness. The person's explanatory
model of illness, including the treatments
that they think will be beneficial, should be
elicited (Sullivan et al., 1991). When a person
is chronically ill, prior roles must be modified
to accommodate the disability resulting from
the illness. Persons' views of themselves--as
handicapped or disabled and their personality
characteristics--will influence their
behaviors and how they interact with their
physicians. So, although behaviors of individuals
with mental and emotional illnesses
may be subtle, health care providers must be
able to assess them.


<b><i>Models for Mind-Body Therapies</i></b>


Once emotional issues are identified, several
models can facilitate the physician's
understanding of the appropriate mind-body
therapies. The high risk model of threat perception,
developed by Wickramasekera
(1995), was discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
Cohen and Rodriguez (1995) proposed a
model in which negative affect and affective
disorders are linked to physical disorders and
illness behavior through biological, behavioral,
cognitive, and social pathways.
Repeated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis can directly initiate

[p. <i>49</i>]

Allostatic load can be lessened if patients
modify their behavior by eating a healthy
diet and reducing tobacco and alcohol use.
The patient who is encouraged to extend
social networks and reduce inactivity, perhaps
in a social context, benefits by
improved ability to manage stress (McEwen,
1998). Current support systems should be
assessed and extended if found lacking.


A stress model designed for both prevention
and intervention in primary care has
been proposed. The person's appraisal of the
potential threat due to a stressful situation
and the success of stress-mitigating behaviors
are superimposed on a genetic and cultural
backdrop (Boone &amp; Christensen, 1997).
Some individuals use health-enhancing
behaviors such as exercise or relaxation to
decrease the impact of stress, while others rely
on health degrading activities, such as smoking
and alcohol use. The primary care
provider needs to elicit information from
patients about their perception of stressful
situations and their use of stress-mitigating
behaviors. Predisposition to cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric
illnesses due to family history, personality, or
environmental factors is important. Type D
personality (high negative affect and social
inhibition) increases risk for cardiac events.
The convergence of multiple risk factors
(Type D personality, younger age, and
decreased left ventricular ejection fraction)
predicts poorer treatment response in patients
with coronary heart disease (Denollet, Vaes, &amp;
Brutsaert, 2000). To illustrate further, stressful
life events are associated with the onset of
major depressive disorders. Approximately
one third of the association is noncausal,
because individuals predisposed to depressive
disorders self-select themselves into high-risk
environments (Kendler, Karkowski, &amp;
Prescott, 1999). General questions about
socioeconomic status, living conditions,
health habits, and leisure activities can yield
important data on the patient's risk for illness
and attitude toward self-care.


The physician may find an analysis of predisposing,
precipitating, and perpetuating
factors in regard to physical and emotional
illness helpful. Patients may be at risk for
stress-related illness because of genetic factors,
history of abuse, low social support, or
chronic stress. Precipitating factors such as
the breakup of a marriage are the initiating
events associated with the onset of illness.
Finally, certain aspects of the patient's life
maintain or exacerbate the illness. For example,
weight gain resulting from inactivity,
boredom, and social isolation increases the
probability of obesity. The overweight
patient or the person steadily gaining a few
pounds a year creates fertile territory for subsequent
diabetes, hypertension, and depressive
illness (Walker et al., 1998). Recognizing
the predisposing and precipitating factors for
onset of illness prior to a well or illness visit
increases the probability of a mutually satisfying,
efficient encounter and successful
intervention if needed.


The physician dealing with a patient with
chronic illness is well advised to consider the
persistent impact of psychological and emotional
factors on the patient's day-to-day disease
management, particularly in crisis. The
physician should recognize that the person's

[p. <i>50</i>]

<b><i>Spiritual Factors</i></b>


Some individuals use prayer and meditation
to help them deal with stressful situations.
Research has shown that frequency of
church attendance was positively related to
physical health and negatively related to
depression. Watching religious television
shows did not confer the same benefits
(Harmon &amp; Myers, 1999). To some people,
prayer and church attendance are important
aspects of life, so a physician's general questioning
about how a patient is coping with illness
should include spiritual factors. Recent
research supports a relationship between religious
involvement and lower mortality
(McCullough, Hoyt, Larson, Koenig, &amp;
Thoresen, 2000).


<b><i>Motivation for Change</i></b>


Motivation for change varies among
individuals and is affected by a person's
perception of the severity of the illness and
his or her capability for self-care. The physician
should estimate the patient's readiness
for change and explain the stages involved in
making a permanent change in behavior. A
patient's current level of stress can predict a
relapse to former maladaptive behaviors; for
example, a patient may overeat during forced
overtime at work or turn to alcohol after
long periods of abstinence when faced with a
personal crisis (Prochaska, Norcross, &amp;
Diclemente, 1994). A person who becomes
sleep deprived during stressful times should
be informed that regular and sufficient sleep
maintains, in part, glucose balance and normal
growth hormone regulation. It follows,
therefore, that families of low socioeconomic
status who are awakened by noise at night
have a higher allostatic load and are thereby
at greater risk for diabetes, hypertension, and
obesity (Van Cauter &amp; Spiegel, 1999).


<b><i>Treating Stress and Mood Disorders</i></b>


Treatment of stress-related illness and
mood disorders has been shown to improve
physical health, add to quality of life, and
decrease demand for services. Two behavioral
medicine interventions decreased
reported distress and service use in comparison
to an information session about stress
and health. The intervention group was given
actual practice in relaxation, education
about mind-body relationships, and cognitive
behavioral therapy (Hellman, Budd,
Borysenko, McClelland, &amp; Benson, 1990).
In patients with cardiovascular disease,
results of treatment of depression on morbidity
and mortality are variable, but quality
of life improves as depressive symptoms are
resolved. Further, depressed patients are at
increased risk for death after myocardial
infarction and are less likely to adhere to
medical treatment recommendations
(Musselman, Evans, &amp; Nemeroft, 1998).
Treatment of depressive illness has been

[p. <i>51</i>]

<b><i>Managing Functional Syndromes</i></b>


Barsky and Borus (1999) recommend a
mult¡step process for management of
patients with functional syndromes. Vague,
poorly defined symptoms should be evaluated,
though not with exhaustive testing.
Assessment of major depressive disorder and
panic disorder is important. The patient
should be engaged in a collaborative effort to
improve quality of life. Education about the
role of psychosocial factors in disease and
cautious reassurance about the absence of
life-threatening disease can be made part of
each office visit. The physician should be
aware of community resources for cognitive
behavioral therapists, psychophysiological
therapists, support groups, and appropriate
complementary services. By demonstrating
their knowledge about the appropriate uses
of yoga, meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback
for well and ill people, physicians place
value on these therapies. Patients are thereby
encouraged to invest the time and money
needed to learn the techniques (Barnes,
Treiber, Turner, Davis, &amp; Strong, 1999).


<b><i>Brief Interventions</i></b>


The potential benefits of short-term or
brief interventions should not be ignored. A
four-session self-care intervention for patients
with back pain changed attitudes about use of
services (Saunders, Von Kroff, Pruitt, &amp;
Moore, 1999). Physician recommendations
to patients that they should stop smoking,
and reduce substance abuse can be as effective
as more costly therapist-intensive approaches
(Heather, 1995). Patients who have problems
with alcohol were shown to benefit from a
few minutes of advice followed by booster
phone calls (Pinto, Goldstein, &amp; Marcus,
1998). Calfas, Salis, Oldenburg, and French
(1997) showed that primary care physicians
who talk with patients about increasing physical
activity were effective in improving
awareness of the necessity for exercise. These
patients also increased activity compared
to those who had no such discussion. Some
minimal therapist interventions for chronic
headache that comprise 3 to 5 sessions
instead of the usual 10 to 12 have similar success
rates (Rowan &amp; Andrasik, 1996).
Positive outcomes of less pain, better sleep,
and lower severity of depression and anxiety
resulted from a short-term, mind-body wellness
intervention. Participants with depression,
sleep disturbances, and pain were
provided with relaxation training, cognitive
restructuring, and learned simple behaviors.
Both the home study course and classroom
instruction were better than the no-intervention
control (Rybarczyk, DeMarco, DeLaCruz, &amp;
Lapidos, 1999).


<b><i>Therapist-Intensive Interventions</i></b>


Review and meta-analysis of studies dealing
with psychological or stress management
interventions in people who have chronic
stressors demonstrated improvements in
immune function. These effects included
increased natural killer cell cytotoxicity and
lymphocyte proliferation in response to an
antigen (Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001). Turner,
Linden, van der Wal, and Schamberg (1995)
compared a treatment program that combined
stress management and exercise with a program
of exercise alone in patients with heart
disease. Blood pressure reactivity to psychological
challenge, which is an important risk
factor for cardiovascular disease, was reduced
after the combined treatment. A recent
Canadian consensus report summarizes the

<b>Summary</b>

This chapter has provided several strategies
for eliciting information from patients in
whom emotional factors or mood disorders
are influencing physical illness. Once the
impact of psychological factors is known, the
physician has multiple resources available,
ranging from brief in-office recommendations
to short-term behavioral interventions
to long-term psychological and complementary
therapies.
