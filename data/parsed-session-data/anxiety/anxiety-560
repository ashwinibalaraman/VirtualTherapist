<b>DR:</b> Okay, so this is your mood log, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see so for April.  Oh, the end of March and when did we meet last?
<b>PT:</b> Remember you -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah middle of March.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right so you kept it since then, boy -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> That's very good.  All right so there's almost no marks unstable is, is there?
<b>PT:</b> I have not been -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah you had one good day.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> The [DATE] was like a good day.
<b>PT:</b> It's I, it's been bad.  I've been like -
<b>DR:</b> So you, you were saying to me that within the same day within a day or two -
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You're up or down.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  Very up or down.
<b>DR:</b> So that you've had -
<b>PT:</b> I think it's lack of sleep.
<b>DR:</b> In March you had several days you had mild mania.  You're more energized.  But in April you felt you where had great difficulty according to this chart because you were too charged up?  You were like thoughts moving very quickly.
<b>PT:</b> Worried about everything.
<b>DR:</b> Worry about everything.  Is it just anxiety?  I mean, when, when you say mania is it, is your mood elevated.  Like you feel like -
<b>PT:</b> Like cleaning the house.
<b>DR:</b> Cleaning the house.
<b>PT:</b> At 3:00 in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> At 2:00 in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right and -
<b>PT:</b> And I also need to that letter for Social Security do you remember?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I don't.  But you could remind me -
<b>PT:</b> After.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll, we'll do that at the end.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So the hours slept average to be about like -
<b>PT:</b> To, horrible.
<b>DR:</b> Five or six.
<b>PT:</b> I'm up every hour.
<b>DR:</b> I see.  Worrying about everything, you're watching your brother's cat for four months.
<b>PT:</b> Now he's gone and I'm very sad.
<b>DR:</b> Really.
<b>PT:</b> That sounds crazy.
<b>DR:</b> So, it looks like your moods only last hours to at most a day right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That changes again?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, well this is, this is very, hon, honestly this is quite helpful don't you think?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Because if you told -
<b>PT:</b> I thought it was.
<b>DR:</b> Me it wouldn't have as much detail.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You told me -
<b>PT:</b> Well I did it every night before I went to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Four in the morning when I got up.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's very good.
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so know let's figure out what we're doing.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So we met about six weeks ago.
<b>PT:</b> But I saw you three weeks ago, remember?
<b>DR:</b> Met on the phone -
<b>PT:</b> Real quick.
<b>DR:</b> What did we do then?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, I gave you the Ambien -
<b>PT:</b> Ambience.
<b>DR:</b> That's right, I, I did write it down actually.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So I gave you two week supply of Ambien?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And what happened with that?
<b>PT:</b> They really don't work, honestly I have -
<b>DR:</b> Nothing.
<b>PT:</b> I haven't slept.
<b>DR:</b> I think that what we have to do is treat the underlying problems.  That's the problem, all right so you know where going to go back to what I said before, uh, I've never, usually when I see you.  You, you either seem pretty good or you seem a little down.  I've never seen you at any extreme and I've said that to you before.  You, you present better than -
<b>PT:</b> I feel -
<b>DR:</b> Than this chart shows, right?
<b>PT:</b> That's really how I feel.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean do you think that you try and put your best foot forward?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but it doesn't serve you well because -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You know?
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Then people think "oh, your not, oh you're not doing that bad."
<b>PT:</b> Right, well um, I go to m, when I go to my doctors it seems like I lose it, [LAUGHING], get very upset.
<b>DR:</b> Your med, your medical doctor?
<b>PT:</b> Medical doctors, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I'm just getting worse and no one has any answer.
<b>DR:</b> All right, but here's what's going on.  We, we did that because we wondered whether you had bipolar depression, meaning, you know, not always depressed but periods of depression just as bad and then periods of elevated or irritable mood and it seems like you do.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly; because that's -
<b>DR:</b> And then you know, last time you said you know, you did say "insomnia, staying up late cleaning and organizing, and so forth and so on."  Um, we gave you Seroquel -
<b>PT:</b> No we did, I didn't, I can't take the Seroquel anymore they give me restless leg syndrome.
<b>DR:</b> You get, you get too hung over.
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> So we have to give you something else.
<b>PT:</b> To sleep?
<b>DR:</b> To sleep.
<b>PT:</b> I think that's where my underlying problem -
<b>DR:</b> No, that's not -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> I, I don't think so.  I think that you, do you ever, uh, did I give you a handout on bipolar disorder?  I mean the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder are periods of -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Maybe it's just me.
<b>PT:</b> Could be.
<b>DR:</b> Menopause.
<b>PT:</b> Could be.
<b>DR:</b> Um, we uh, the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder are periods of depressed mood, fatigue, withdrawal, misery, alternating with periods of heightened energy, some times heightened confidence, uh not sleeping, uh, often, it's interesting only like a sexist thing.  But often times uh, female patients say, cleaning.  Isn't that funny?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Cleaning.
<b>PT:</b> What do males say?  Fidget?
<b>DR:</b> The males don't say anything but probably they're probably on the prowl you know.  I mean uh, get in fights with people.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, right.
<b>DR:</b> Women often say staying up all night cleaning, organizing, rearranging the furniture, this kind of stuff.
<b>PT:</b> The stuff in the uh -
<b>DR:</b> So this is a very useful handout in terms of -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Describing the symptoms.  Um, I think you really have bipolar two disorder, which are mild elevations and rapid just between, you know, elevated and depressed.  The depression is just as bad but the elevations are briefer and milder.  So I think you have that.  Now, we tried Seroquel, did we try anything else for you, didn't we try Lamictal at one point?
<b>PT:</b> The what?
<b>DR:</b> Did we not try that?
<b>PT:</b> What is it called?
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal?
<b>PT:</b> No.  What is it?
<b>DR:</b> Oh, well that's what you should be on.
<b>PT:</b> What is it?
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal, I mean when people have mood swings like this.  To have them on an antidepressant is really the wrong thing.  The Prozac does lift your mood but it also promotes the up and down that you see on the chart.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Up down, up down, up down -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And what really is better is a medicine that uh, prevents ideally highs and lows.
<b>PT:</b> Mood stabilizer?
<b>DR:</b> A mood stabilizer and there are a number of medicines the nicest one, the nicest one is called Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b> What's the side effects?
<b>DR:</b> That's why it's the nicest one.  It really has little or no side effects -
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't make you tired, it doesn't cause weight gain.
<b>PT:</b> Good, good.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, it's really pretty nice.  So, that's what I'd put you on -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The wrinkle is -
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> It takes weeks and weeks before it really works well.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, but -
<b>DR:</b> So we have to give you something for sleep probably in the meantime.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, we tried Ambien CR -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah that was a long time ago though.  I, I'm, I can't, I don't get it how could I not sleep?
<b>DR:</b> Because you're too charged up to sleep.
<b>PT:</b> Do I -
<b>DR:</b> I mean the Prozac is probably driving that.  But if -
<b>PT:</b> Twenty mg in the morning?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but if we stop the Prozac -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You might feel a little more depressed.  What we might want to do is a compromise is just lower the Prozac.
<b>PT:</b> It's only 20 now?
<b>DR:</b> I know but we can go -
<b>PT:</b> But to 10.
<b>DR:</b> Down to 10.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You told me that 30 you were too elevated.
<b>PT:</b> It was too elevated.  Do you have a tissue?
<b>DR:</b> No, so what?  And, and I'm taping this and I still said, "No."  Isn't that unbelievable?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> What?  All right let me, you know what, I'm sorry I ran out, let me just -
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> I stole them for somebody else.  All right, so -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] allergies.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it -
<b>PT:</b> I happened to notice all the pollen on the cars this year?
<b>DR:</b> Yes, well it always happens -
<b>PT:</b> No more than this, I think.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I think, I have a black car.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe because it was uh, uh fairly mild winter but a lot of people are complaining right now so everything is popping out.  Um, so you're taking the Klonopin three times?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And you're taking the Prozac once in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And the Ambien did nothing?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I was taking two of them.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yo, really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And two did nothing?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Then it's a tough problem.  I don't know if we're going to, Seroquel we gave you what else could we give you?
<b>PT:</b> The Seroquel would make me sleep but I would get that, that -
<b>DR:</b> Two -
<b>PT:</b> Um, restless leg syndrome -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> That it, uh want to jump out of a window.
<b>DR:</b> Right, well often the other things that I would give you for sleep um, you know might be -
<b>PT:</b> What about Valium?  Or is that just too much?
<b>DR:</b> No, Valium is in the same family as Klonopin.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So if Klonopin is not working then you know -
<b>PT:</b> Well Klonopin definitely keeps my anxiety a little bit better -
<b>DR:</b> But what if we, what if we at least made the Klonopin in stead of three times a day maybe one in the morning, two in the evening then?
<b>PT:</b> No, we've done that.
<b>DR:</b> We've done that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  What if we just up the Klonopin?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That's a Band Aid, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Got you.
<b>DR:</b> The underlying problem I think is this, this, the mood swings.  The Klonopin is just treating a little bit of the anxiety.  The Prozac is probably making the mood swings worse and the Ambien or whatever is just again, just trying to deal with the insomnia so -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I would honestly tell you, it would make sense to lower the Prozac, which we could either give you a 10 or we could actually give you the, Prozac is unusual.  Unusual because most things you should never skip a day and take everyday.  Prozac you could, actually could skip every other day and it'll average out, 20, 0, 20, 0, 20, 0 until about 10 a day.
<b>PT:</b> I could do that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you have a lot of 20s left?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right so, uh, tomorrow is [DATE], you took it today already, right the [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So, you know maybe let we could say even number days take it.  Take it the second, the fourth, the sixth and you know you have your mood.  We'll give you another mood log and you can keep it track that way.
<b>PT:</b> See how it works, right.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> How am I going to sleep at night?
<b>DR:</b> Well, you took 2, 10 mg Ambien did nothing?  I mean lowering the Prozac will help.  The Lamictal in time will help.  It will gradually help, um, what else to give you for sleep.  What else have you tried?
<b>PT:</b> We did the trazodone; it felt like my throat was closing.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't like that?
<b>PT:</b> Strangest, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Ambien, we tried Ambien CR, I mean I could, on a short term basis I could give you something that might be a little weight gaining?  But you don't want to do that.
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um, I've lost 25 pounds; I'm not going to do anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> That's the problem, there's a couple of things that -
<b>PT:</b> Like what, what were you going to suggest?  No I can't do that then I'll really be depressed.
<b>DR:</b> Doxepin, Zyprexa things that are very, you know even -
<b>PT:</b> I tried that Zyprexa.
<b>DR:</b> Or within a couple of weeks you might gain a little weight, you might, you know.  You tried which one?
<b>PT:</b> Xepor, say that again?
<b>DR:</b> Zyprexa?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> The other one?
<b>DR:</b> Doxepin?
<b>PT:</b> No, I guess it wasn't -
<b>DR:</b> So those are very uh, I could give you Restoril for like -
<b>PT:</b> That's -
<b>DR:</b> Short term.
<b>PT:</b> That's what the doctor suggested at the hospital.  Restoril -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Short term.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Just so I could get some sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  All right so why don't we do that in the short term.
<b>PT:</b> That's fine.
<b>DR:</b> Meaning like a month, no longer?
<b>PT:</b> Fine and I come back and then see how my moods different.
<b>DR:</b> All right so let's, that's good.  That's a plan, all right and then we'll go over the Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, that's a morning drug?
<b>DR:</b> That's most people take it in the morning.  If you found it made you a little drowsy you can move it to evening.  But typically people take it in the mornings.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, uh, I usually shut this off because now I'm just writing and blah, blah, blah, so let's see.
<b>PT:</b> Got it.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, so here's the Lamictal starter pack and there's a specific reason that they do this.  I'm telling you that this is a very desirable medicine to go on.  Hopefully it will suit you nicely.  But, it has one but.  It doesn't cause weight gain, doesn't cause tiredness, doesn't usually cause stomach upset, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The one thing that if is associated with a little bit is a rash.  Now any medicine can cause an allergic reaction.  Prozac can cause an allergic rash you know anything can -
<b>PT:</b> I'm not a rash kind of person.
<b>DR:</b> Good, okay.
<b>PT:</b> Where would the rash be, [LAUGHING]?
<b>DR:</b> Um, well -
<b>PT:</b> Somewhere, red?
<b>DR:</b> If you got, if you got a couple of bumps.  You know if you have a little bit of an allergic rash you should stop it and -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let me know -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Immediately.  The rash of concern you would never miss.  It will be widespread or painful, or involve your eyes, nose, or mouth.  If you get anything that starts emerging as a serious rash, you have to get to an emergency room.  Then it's a medical emergency.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's rare -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's less than 1 out of 1000 but it's important that you know.  No it's important that you know -
<b>PT:</b> No that's fine.
<b>DR:</b> If you get anything like that you got to get evaluated quickly right away.
<b>PT:</b> Red eyes?  You mean red eyes?
<b>DR:</b> No, just uh, rash on your skin or eyes, nose, mouth -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That's really bad.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, it, even if you get like a little bit of a typical like you know, uh, any kind of rash then hold off and let me know right away.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So, to prevent that they start really slowly, this is why it doesn't work for weeks and weeks -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because for the first 2 weeks you only take 25 mg a day.  So, one pill a day.  If you miss it, don't double up, you know, if you take, looks like you're good with this but you know for some reason you don't take it on day three, just go -
<b>PT:</b> Continue?
<b>DR:</b> To the next, yeah -
<b>PT:</b> Got you.
<b>DR:</b> Go, take the day three on day four just don't double up.  So, 1 for 2 weeks then you take 2 of them for 2 weeks and then you're up that's 50 mg, 25 for 2 weeks, 50 for 2 weeks, now you're up to 100.
<b>PT:</b> Wow.
<b>DR:</b> Now the typical dosage, the range is 50 to 200 but the typical dosage that people end on is you know, plus or minus 150, 150, 200.  So we usually march right up to 150 or 200.  But, we ought to meet within four weeks so we see what's going on.  Plus I'm only going to give you the Restoril for four weeks.  You know, it's very habit forming.  I don't really want you to get too, big in that.  So, um so I'll give you a kit that will look just like this -
<b>PT:</b> They will.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Got you.
<b>DR:</b> The pharmacy will give you exact same -
<b>PT:</b> Can I see that?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  That's that it'll have all that info on it.  All right so we'll give you that, we'll give you the Restoril, and we'll keep, oh and, and we're going to lower the Prozac.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Well -
<b>PT:</b> And well I'm going to skip it every other day?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I can write for 10s, but if you want -
<b>PT:</b> Whatever you want to do.
<b>DR:</b> If, if you have, if you have a bunch of, you have a bunch 20s left.
<b>PT:</b> I do have a bunch of 20s I mine as well get rid of them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, then that would be, uh, uh fine with me to do that, and clonazepam you need a refill probably, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> And then the letter to Social Security.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, okay.
