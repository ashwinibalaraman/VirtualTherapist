BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Go ahead and, uh, uh, uh, tell the kind of things that you are experiencing, what all is going on with you.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, mentally drained, physically drained.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Try to go to sleep at night and I feel so bad—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I just don't want to wake up.  Sometimes wishing I'd just die in my sleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, just I feel worthless because I cannot function.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and I get down and depressed over that, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Being [AGE], you know, I'm not supposed to be like this.  I'm supposed to be able to, you know, take care of my wife and take care of my kids.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And do things that somebody my age typically would do rather than stay in bed.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, uh, now, when you think about all of that, and, uh, reflecting on your life, uh, tell me how does that, uh, make you feel?
<b>PT:</b>	Just worthless.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And, uh, uh, when, uh, that thought goes through mind, are you able to concentrate?  Are you able to, uh, pay attention to what it going on?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm so physically and mentally drained—
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.
<b>PT:</b>	That I forget a lot of things.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And, uh, uh, at that, you know, is it just forgetting or difficulty concentrating also?
<b>PT:</b>	Concentrating as well.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, okay.  And, uh, uh, the type of, uh, medications that have helped you to handle that, uh, hello?  Yeah.  Mm.  Call me back.  Go ahead.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well you gave me the oxycontins—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Seemed to work—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	A little bit better than methadone did.  Methadone pretty much did nothing for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I have, I did experiment a little bit with what you gave me trying to, you know, change the dosage just slightly to see what helped and what didn't.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, you know, I've seemed to found a little bit of a balance.
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, but ran out of medications because of my little experiment.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, and then antidepressants, I've gone the gamut with, uh, Prozac—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And Zoloft.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm not sure that it is that you got me on now.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Trileptal.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I forgot, oxy thing, there's another one you gave me last time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, can't remember the name of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.  And, uh, uh, now, the, you had, uh, when you were younger, uh, what kind of things they diagnose you with?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, I was just hyper.
<b>DR:</b>	Hyper?
<b>PT:</b>	Little bit hyper.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, uh, uh, at that time, they called—
<b>PT:</b>	Slow, slow learning, but, you know, they finally found a way that I was able to—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Adapt to that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  At that time, they give you a diagnosis of ADHD, I suppose?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	No?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  At any time did they give you a diagnosis of, said that with your hyperness and, uh, you never [INAUDIBLE] to—
<b>PT:</b>	No, just I, I, I took all that energy and used it in sports—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And stuff like that.  So, it seemed like, you know, I had an outlet for it.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  At any time, anyone, uh, discussed, uh, with you possibility of adult ADHD?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, all right.  And, uh, if somebody were to, uh, you know, suggest that, how would that make you feel?
<b>PT:</b>	Anything that would make me feel the way I used to, would be able to do the things I used to.  Maybe not to the same degree, but to be able to take an active—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Interest—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And just be part of the things I used to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't expect to be the way I was, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, you know, the, the situation here is, of course, uh, a combination of, uh, many things.  Uh, and, uh, then, uh, uh, you have diabetes and the pain associated with that, uh, adds a lot to the anxiety, the concentration, and, uh, uh, that, the so called hyperness that you used to have as a child that you, you know, used to, uh, take it, uh, uh, use it for sports and other activities.  Uh, now, uh, uh, you know, it's not, uh, you're not able to use it.  That would be—
<b>PT:</b>	Been out of bed for an hour or two hours and I'm physically drained.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, uh, uh, so, uh, you know, lot of, internal hyperness, emotional hyperness and, uh, the pain together—
<b>PT:</b>	And then not being able to do that makes me depressive.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And—
<b>PT:</b>	Extremely.  That's why I said I want, you know, I feel like I just want to roll over and die.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE], uh, because when people suffer, you know, through that, uh, uh, uh, basically chronically for many years, uh, all of a sudden they lose a faith in themselves, because, uh, uh, you know, the, the question is that, uh, you have, uh, mind asks you constantly is why do I have to suffer through, you know, suffer this much?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, exactly what I say.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and, uh, so, uh, you know, it's, uh, uh, you, uh, tend to give up because, you know, when a same question is asked, uh, uh, all the time, uh, we become sort of resistant to that, uh, you know, question.  It doesn't have any meaning behind that.
<b>PT:</b>	I try to play music for four hour a week, DJ.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I've done that for twenty years.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I just literally had to tell the lady that I did it for that I cannot do it and I broke down.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And, uh, you know, sometimes, uh, what it is, the music that you play may bring some, uh, bring out some of the inner emotions, because that, uh, certain, uh, tunes, uh, have, uh, a meaning behind them and, uh, if, uh, that particular tune has, uh, uh, some meaning, uh, you know, and, uh, your emotions get stirred up, uh, you're not going to—
<b>PT:</b>	Literally—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I said I cannot do it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I said mentally and physically I feel so bad—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I had to walk away.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What we will do is, uh, let's see whether we can, uh, uh, approach it, uh, uh, you know, maybe, uh, uh, try some, uh, uh, you know, ingenious way and see whether, uh, uh, adding something that, uh, uh, helps with your concentration, your motivation, uh, may make things a little better.  Okay?  And, uh, uh, uh, are you allergic to anything that you know of?
<b>PT:</b>	Sulfas.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, so.  Uh, uh, let's see what we can do, okay?  And, now, you mentioned about, uh, uh, you know, uh, wanting to die and all that.  On a scale of one to five, uh, where is your anxiety?
<b>PT:</b>	A four.
<b>DR:</b>	Four.
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes five.
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.  Uh, how about, uh, uh, interest in, uh, you know, one a scale of one to five, uh, interest in, uh, sex?
<b>PT:</b>	It's about a zero.
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I want to—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But the medications I'm on, he's not functioning very well right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So, uh, that's a medication effect.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's another depressive thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And also, you know, your diabetes.  Diabetes is, uh, uh, uh, the leading cause of, uh, sexual dysfunction and, uh, uh, that, uh, uh, medications, uh, add to that.  Uh, because most of the medications, uh, that you take, lower your blood pressure; therefore, it takes a little more time to even, uh, when you have interest, to go to the next, uh, uh, phase, which is called the excitement stage.  And, uh, so let's see what we can do.
<b>PT:</b>	I've had sex twice in the last six months.
<b>DR:</b>	Mm.
<b>PT:</b>	He's functioned maybe twice in the last six months.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, I guess, uh, at least that means there is still, uh, uh, some, uh, uh, you know, action left.  Only now that we have to do is, uh, take care of some of your, uh, you know, depression and anxiety and the ADHD kind of symptoms.  Okay?  So let's see what we can do.  Anything else you want to, uh, tell me?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Thank you for the, uh, everything.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Eighteen.
<b>DR:</b>	Eighteen.  When did you turn eighteen?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, [DATE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  How does it feel like, uh, to be a teenager?  Mm?
<b>PT:</b>	Same as, uh—
<b>CG:</b>	You mean adult?
<b>PT:</b>	A long, long time ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, okay.  Now, uh, one of the things is, uh, you have, uh, uh, been having a condition, uh, that was diagnosed, uh, uh, quite some time ago.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Is that right?  Do you know what the condition is?
<b>PT:</b>	Diabetes.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, and that is the medical condition.  And what's the, the psychiatric condition.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Bipolar disorder.  Is that right?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  And, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, uh, describe, uh, you know, your moods, uh, uh, you know, on a day to day basis.  Are you a moody person?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And, uh, do you recognize, uh, uh, the moodiness?  When it is, when is it, uh, more obvious to you?
<b>PT:</b>	All the time.
<b>DR:</b>	All the time.  And, of course, when your blood sugar fluctuates, uh, it gets worse.  Isn't that right?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, okay.  And, uh, now, um, during that time, have you, do you get emotional or, uh, giggly or, uh, uh, antsy, hm?  What happens?
