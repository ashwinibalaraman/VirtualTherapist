<b>AN EMOTIONAL WORLD</b>


Our emotions shape the events in our lives. We typically seek out those
things, people or activities we enjoy, that bring us happiness, and we
avoid or minimize those that bring us discomfort or pain. Strong feelings
or passions can extend not only to our relationships with others but to our
moral, religious, professional and political convictions. Delight and disgust,
pride and shame, joy and sadness, love and loathing all form part of
the tapestry of human existence.


Ask someone to recall a particularly memorable film or play or sporting
event and the chances are they won't relate the facts; they'll tell you
about the elements which touched them emotionally. They'll emphasize
the really sad parts, maybe (I was choking back the tears) or the really
uplifting bit (I nearly cried) or, in the case of the sporting event, perhaps
the disappointment which turned to hope and then to joy (I was on the
edge of my seat; I could hardly bear to look; I was speechless by the
end). They may relate their behaviours, but they link them firmly to their
feelings. People who sell things understand the power of our emotions and
how they can influence our behaviour. Watch practically any television
advertisement and note how little of it seeks just to convey factual information.
Something which holds out the promise of popularity, enhanced

[p. <i>84</i>]

This doesn't mean that contentment is necessarily people's only goal.
Some go to horror movies, seek out the most scary rides in theme parks
or pay to bungee-jump in the anticipation of fear and the physiological
effects which accompany that emotion. Whether or not we like it, some
people gain pleasure from fighting and hurting others, enjoy the frisson
which accompanies revenge, take satisfaction in their victory and
another's defeat. For some these satisfactions are channelled vicariously
(through television soap operas or through watching football, for example)
or adopt simulated forms (violent computer games provide an example, as
do some physical sports and activities such as paintballing). Others may
act them out more directly; they may become branded antisocial, but
perhaps they gain admiration and prestige, at least from some. In short, we
live in a world that is full of emotions, some which we approve of and
some we'd prefer not to acknowledge. Everyone has them.


<b>EBD AND EDUCATION</b>


With this in mind, we can now look at what has been done for young
people seen to experience difficulties with their emotions. In UK educational
circles, the term maladjusted was in vogue until it became supplanted
by the phrase emotional and behavioural difficulties in the last
quarter of the twentieth century. Laslett (1977) coined the phrase in his
classic text for teachers and around the same time the government-convened
Warnock Committee (DES, 1978) acknowledged, albeit reluctantly,
that the word maladjusted might stigmatize a child. The epithet
maladjusted, of course, suggested that a young person was insufficiently
adapted to the demands placed on him or her in particular situations.
Emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) on the other hand, covered
two areas: the inner world of the child (his or her emotions) and the
outer world of behaviour. The second of these might reasonably be
expected to present more problems for the school and for those teaching
the child. In spite of the Warnock Committee's warning that labelling of
any kind should be avoided, and in the face of an increasingly radical
challenge to discriminatory terminology, EBD became the descriptor of
choice. It remains with us today, even if the term social has been bolted
on along the way.


But not much else changed. Laslett (1977) in fact used the term EBD
interchangeably with maladjusted, as did Warnock (DES, 1978). It

<b>EMOTIONS AND SCHOOLING</b>


At the end of the 1980s, the government at the time commissioned a major
report on pupil behaviour, stimulated in part by teacher unions' concerns
and by the widespread popular concern with school bullying. The Elton
Committee (DES, 1989) itself commissioned research from Sheffield
University. There was plenty of opportunity for the researchers to engage
with teachers' emotions and the affective (emotional) states of some of
their more disturbing pupils. Unfortunately they touched only on the
apparently observable: on behaviours which teachers found difficult to
deal with, on the sanctions they used and the kinds of problems (interrupting
lessons, verbally abusing other children so on) they encountered
during their working week. Although we can reasonably assume that emotions
of many kinds (probably those of teachers and the politicians' emotions
disturbed by their unions) led to the commissioning of this report, it
focused solely on the B, not the E, of EBD. Its only contribution to the
emotional lexicon can be found in its reference to the anxiety and paranoia
(1989: 151) engendered by the formal assessment process, although
in doing this it also acknowledged that emotional problems can themselves
constitute a special educational need.

[p. <i>86</i>]

The first Code of Practice on assessing children's special educational
needs, published a few years later (DfE, 1994), embraced EBD as a learning
difficulty. The relevant sections dwelt mainly on behaviour, although
there was mention of four felt states or emotions: depression, fears, frustration
and anger. The Code was intended to be followed by all those in
education, although in fact it was given little priority by anyone other than
educational psychologists, specialist education officers and schools' special
educational need co-ordinators or SENCOs (Bowers et al., 1998). In
many secondary schools, SENCOs paid little attention to matters classed
as EBD, leaving these to the pastoral and disciplinary systems to deal
with. The current Code of Practice (DfES, 2001) is considerably less
forthcoming about emotions. Basing its categories of special educational
need on those defined earlier by the English (not the British) government's
Teacher Training Agency, this Code talks of development rather
than difficulties, adding social to emotional and behavioural (DfES,
2001: 7.60). The best we learn is that a child with what is now termed
SEBD may require help or counselling, flexible teaching arrangements,
help with emotional maturity and a few other anodyne provisions.
It does nothing to enhance our knowledge of young people's
emotional states and how they may influence their learning and behaviour
at school.


Yet a visit to a government-inspired report from another era reveals far
greater awareness of the importance of emotions than that demonstrated
by the Code of Practice. Almost 50 years ago the Underwood Committee
(MoE, 1955) presented a report on <i>Maladjusted Children</i>, which engaged
far more fully with the emotional outcomes of relationships. It talked of
a state of friction ... in which each side becomes resentful, suspicious or
cold (1955: 93). It warned of the vicious cycle (1955: 94) in which
anxiety can lead to aggression, then to guilt and so to greater anxiety. The
impact of insecurity and unhappiness on children's personal relationships
was noted in this report, as was some children's apparent inability to
respond to love and reassurance. Such topics as dread and the outcomes
of inappropriately handled jealousy fell easily within the report's discourse.
Unlike today's Code of Practice, the Underwood Report did not
shy away from considering the link between emotions and behaviour or
from accepting that presenting conditions such as anxiety or aggression
may have differing emotional sources. Although the report was written
long before emotional intelligence (for example, Mayer and Salovey,
1993; Goleman, 1995) became an accepted part of everyday parlance, its
recommendations on the qualities which teachers and others working with
maladjusted children should possess suggest that its authors may well
have had that characteristic in mind.

[p. <i>87</i>]

It seems, then, that emotions have been given a back seat where
formally identified special educational needs are concerned. This doesn't
mean that the words emotional and emotionally, linked to difficulties,
problems, disturbance and disturbed, aren't still widely found. They
are; but they tend to be non-specific. It's perhaps a bit like saying that a car
has an engine problem or a house has a structural difficulty. It's doubtful
whether the terms would be much good even to a motorist or a householder.
They might cause a bit of worry, but they don't suggest what could
be or ought to be done. When they come from a mechanic or a builder we
could be forgiven for questioning their competence.


<b>EMOTIONAL AWARENESS</b>


While the Code of Practice on SEN (DfES, 2001) is thin on emotions,
what has happened in individual schools has often been of richer quality.
Over the past few years many schools have paid increasing attention to
children's capacity to understand and express their feelings. Goleman
(1995) put forward the notion that there is such a thing as emotional intelligence
which is independent of conventional definitions of intellect. At
around the same time we saw the development of educational programmes
intended to develop emotional competence in children. The Promoting
Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum (Greenberg et al.,
1995), for example, set out to improve at risk children's range of vocabulary
and fluency in discussing emotional experience. It established
agreed rules for when and how particular emotions might be displayed.
Understanding of emotions and management of certain emotions were
also emphasized. PATHS has now been adopted in many schools in the
United Kingdom; in some it is used with all students rather than with
those considered emotionally vulnerable.


A range of primers has recently appeared, aimed at increasing students' or
adults' emotional intelligence (for example, Brearley, 2001) or emotional
literacy (Sharp, 2001). Despite their titles, emotions themselves seem to
receive less prominence in these than they do in PATHS. Brearley (2001),
for example, focuses on what appear to be dispositions (ambition, self-awareness,
optimism, empathy, integrity), although these are described as
emotional states. A similar focus is provided by Sharp (2001), with
self-awareness, resilience, motivation, interpersonal skills, influence and
decisiveness given prominence. True emotions (happy, sad, mad and so on)
are of course mentioned, and there is little doubt that texts such as these
promote emotional awareness. Anyone acquainted with counsellor training,
management training or sales training will find a lot that is familiar in

[p. <i>88</i>]

So there are positive moves in many of our schools and classrooms.
What, though, of the children whose emotional problems are sufficiently
extreme for them to come to the attention of their local education authorities?
When they are labelled EBD or SEBD, what actual feeling states are
identified as causing difficulties? Given the title of this chapter, I propose
to concentrate on emotions themselves rather than the personal characteristics
which may promote or limit those emotions.


<b>WHAT'S THE E IN EBD?</b>


I have just finished looking at the statements of 16 children (14 boys, 2
girls) which had been recently issued in three English local authorities.
For those outside England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a statement is a
legal document which indicates educational needs and sets out special
arrangements to be made to meet those needs. It has similar force to the
IEP (Individual Education Plan) in the United States. A statement is the
product of a multiprofessional assessment involving, at the very least,
detailed assessments and reports by teachers and an educational psychologist.
The common feature of all 16 children was that their statements
clearly related to EBDs.


So if these children were legally defined as having emotional as well as
behavioural difficulties, we might reasonably expect to find the nature of
those emotions and why they caused difficulties spelled out in Parts 2 and 3
of their statements (these are the sections dealing with special educational
needs and the provision to be made to meet them). Certainly I found plenty
of description of behaviour; terms such as restless, distractible, aggressive,
verbally threatening, destructive, self harming, temper outbursts,
impulsive, unmanageable and abusive provide some examples.
Motivational attributions such as antisocial, defiant, demanding and disaffected
also cropped up in some of the statements, as did the diagnostic
categories ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: five cases)
and ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder: one case). Low self-esteem
and low self confidence also cropped up in 10 of these statements; we can
reasonably discount these as emotions, however, even though they may be
states of mind which give rise to emotions. Self-esteem is, as Apter (1997)
points out, notoriously hard to assess with any accuracy; it is made up from
a set of beliefs and expectations experienced by the child, and will
inevitably be linked to his or her felt states (emotions). Low self-esteem
is essentially a disposition and so unlikely to be of much help in either

[p. <i>89</i>]

If we remove descriptions of behaviours, attributions of motives and
dispositional descriptions, we can concentrate on these students' emotions 
the E of the EBD which their local education authorities saw as
sufficiently important to warrant both multidisciplinary assessment and
specialist provision. Yet of the 16 statements, only nine could be found to
say anything at all about emotions. Two mentioned anxiety, while
another talked of frequent mood swings. The latter, of course, isn't an
emotion but it is suggestive of labile emotional states, so I counted it. Just
one emotion was common to all the nine EBD statements which had any
E in them: unsurprisingly perhaps, it was <i>anger</i>. Such phrases as angry
and frustrated, angry outbursts and needs help with managing anger
cropped up in all nine. Anger went with anxiety, with defiance, destruction
and aggression. Although it was only mentioned in just over half the statements,
it was implied in most of the others. Somehow it was the unifying
emotion in these EBD statements.


This was a small sample and may be unrepresentative of all children with
statements for EBD. Yet when I discuss emotions with those (teachers as
well as education officers, advisers and psychologists) who work with
young people seen to have social, emotional and behavioural difficulties,
most of them suggest anger as the emotion most likely to be connected to
those difficulties. This doesn't come as a surprise. Anger in others is likely
not only to be hard to deal with; in schools it usually has to be dealt with in
a very public way. It is an emotional state that both boys and girls recognize
and can label equally effectively when they are as young as four (Hughes
and Dunn, 2002), whereas awareness of another basic negative emotion 
sadness  develops rather later. Displays of anger, as Hughes and Dunn
(2002) point out, are not only more dramatic than those of other emotions,
they are also likely to be encountered more frequently. Manifestations of
anger are also potentially threatening to the beholder. They can easily evoke
fear and anxiety. The Greek philosopher Aristotle saw anger both as a boiling
of the blood and an appetite for returning pain for pain (Barnes, 1984:
403); to be on the receiving end of anger can be an uncomfortable experience
for school staff, children and parents. So it seems reasonable that anger
should get top billing in EBD statements.


It seems reasonable, but in fact it's superficial. It is unworthy of the
expensive, time-consuming and supposedly professional multidisciplinary
assessments that have led to the formulation of the statements. We all know
about anger because we have experienced it lots of times in our lives. It's
easy to recognize and difficult to deal with. It is intuitively easy to assume
that if there was less of it, then life would be easier for teachers and pupils

[p. <i>90</i>]

<b>DISTURBANCE OR DIFFICULTY?</b>


The problem with EBDs is that they present a problem for schools. Ask
any teacher who the EBD children are (or the ones they find challenging,
they're often the same) and they will be able to tell you. Ask them to define
their emotional difficulties, though, and they may not find it so easy.
Whether we choose the word difficulties or opt for disturbance to provide
the D in EBD, it is worth briefly considering what constitutes a difficulty
or a disturbance where emotions are concerned. These days it is
generally accepted by psychologists and philosophers alike (for example,
Lazarus, 1999; Neu, 2000) that emotions and thoughts are inextricably
intertwined. What we think about a situation (that is, how we perceive it)
will affect how we feel  and how we feel will strongly affect our thoughts.
There's nothing essentially disturbed about a felt state (emotion); it simply
flows from thoughts about people, problems and situations.


So where there are emotional disturbances (or difficulties), these will go
hand-in-hand with disturbed (or difficulty-inducing) thinking. Some things
just don't seem the same to the young person with EBD as they do to most
other children of similar age. They're experienced <i>more intensely</i> (or sometimes
considerably less intensely) or simply <i>differently</i>. What most people
see as faintly frustrating becomes deeply annoying. What most see as humorous
becomes insulting. What most see as being a bit of a challenge becomes
terrifyingly strange. These elements of cognitive intensity and cognitive
difference lead children with EBD to demonstrate three things: <i>extremes of
emotion</i> which seem somehow unusual or unreasonable; <i>abnormal displays
of emotion</i> which run counter to those that we might expect in most similarly-aged
young people; and sometimes an <i>apparent absence</i> of certain emotions
which we see as normal (for example, compassion).


Although I haven't met any of the young people whose statements I
referred to earlier, I suspect that their emotions alone didn't bring them
to the attention of their local education authorities (LEAs). It was their

[p. <i>91</i>]

<b>A MASKING EMOTION</b>


Starting with 135 separately named emotions, Shaver et al.'s (2001)
research with young people ended up with just six core components (or
prototypes) of emotion. These six  love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness
and fear  are not far removed from Ekman and Friesen's (1975; 1976)
earlier characterization of the emotion states which are recognizable from
facial expressions. However, Shaveret al.'s analysis, based on the complexity
of our language and its associated meanings, goes further. Within
each one of the core emotions we can find a wide range of contributory
emotions. Sadness, for example, has 36, while joy contains 33. Shaver et al's
(2001) results indicate that within anger alone up to 30 different emotion
states are traceable. To name just a few, we can locate such feelings as
irritation, frustration, bitterness, vengefulness, contempt and revulsion
within the over-arching prototype of anger. Since I've highlighted anger
as the critical emotion in the (admittedly small) sample of children's statements
I examined, I will focus on this in the ensuing sections.


So what does it mean when anger is seen as the predominant emotion with
which a student has difficulty or which is somehow disturbed? Not very
much when there are so many different emotions which can underpin or sustain
it. Indeed, evidence from other research suggests that we can expand on
the already long list that Shaver and his co-workers have compiled, certainly
where the behaviour and discipline of young people are concerned. For
example, Rutter et al. (1998) have pointed to the strong and consistent association
between childhood antisocial behaviour of all kinds and depression
and anxiety. Yet depression features under the general heading of sadness
in Shaver et al.'s (2001) six prototypes, while they put anxiety firmly under

[p. <i>92</i>]

You may still find yourself wondering why I'm delving this deep.
Surely an angry child is an angry child, whatever the emotional archaeology
associated with that anger? And generally speaking, displays of anger
in school or anywhere else aren't desirable. It's not hard for them to prove
intolerable. Anger can beget violence. Exclusion from school often flows
from incidents associated with anger. That's why we have anger management
programmes (for example, Faupel et al., 1998) to help students to
regulate it. That's why we have programmes aimed at increasing emotional
intelligence (for example, Brearley, 2001). That's why counsellors
are now employed in some schools and they will often work with children
who are seen to have problems with their anger. Forget the rest of it  it's
the anger and the behaviours that go with it that creates problems for most
schools and for society as a whole.


That may be so. But we need also to remember the status of a statement
which relates to emotional difficulties. It indicates that the young
person's affective state (not just his or her behaviour) is sufficiently problematic
and intractable to interfere with his or her learning to the extent
that special arrangements are necessary. Those arrangements (sometimes
specialist provision or separate schooling, often the allocation of an additional
person in class or at break times) are sufficiently resource-intensive
to merit a statement. Multi-professional assessment and deliberation have
gone into the decision-making process. Reports have been written not
only by those in the school, but always by trained psychologists and often
by social workers and medical professionals. The process can take six
months or more. The purpose of a statement is to outline the young
person's needs in some detail and set out what should be done, on the
basis of those individual requirements, to meet them. Given all this, to end
up so often with just one predominant emotion seems a bit thin when the
sources of anger can be so different and when the emotions which support
and sustain outward displays of temper or anger can be so varied.


<b>THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS</b>


I have already mentioned that it is now generally recognized that thoughts and
feelings go hand-in-hand. In simple terms, most therapeutic interventions

[p. <i>93</i>]

What happens in early life when we contact others' emotions will affect
our own ability to integrate those emotions into our own thinking. That
very difficulty in thinking about emotions will make it hard to develop a
full and appropriate range of feelings.


<b>TOWARDS A TYPOLOGY OF ANGER</b>


Just asking a young person why they seem constantly bad-tempered,
short-fused and easy to rouse to anger will probably not reveal the thinking
that underlies their presenting emotional state. This may appear self-evident,
but very few reports I read seem to explore the thinking and
feeling states that could contribute to the emotional difficulties observed
(or inferred to be present) in the student. It isn't always easy to do, yet
because it is not easy doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted. By now it
will be apparent that anger alone does not offer a good descriptor of the
emotions which it may conceal. I will turn to these shortly. But let's
assume that we accept the description of anger as the sole emotion. Even
then, we need to ask just what type of anger we are encountering.


Anger can take many forms. We are obviously familiar with rage,
abuse, violence and so on: anyone demonstrating these seems pretty obviously
angry. But what about the sullen, uncommunicative individual?
What about the person who seems strained and icily polite when dealing
with you? What about the individual who appears co-operative and compliant
but then turns out not to have done what they were expected to do?
When someone lets you down for no apparent reason, and perhaps does
so on more than one occasion, is that just forgetfulness or is it maybe a
demonstration of concealed anger? Lazarus (1999) helps us here by discriminating
between five types of anger. While all are classifiable under
one emotional heading, they take different forms. It isn't difficult to see,
either, that different thought patterns are likely to accompany them. For
brevity, they are set out in Table 6.1.

[p. <i>95</i>]

If these different kinds of anger aren't enough, we need to bear in mind
also the range of emotions which can engender anger. It is too simple to
assume that anger arises just because someone is angry. The emotional
difficulties of many children who show anger and the aggression that goes
with it are likely to have other deeper emotions underlying them. Space
doesn't allow much elaboration, but we will look at just a few of these.
Any attempt to manage that anger (or effectively to reduce the behaviours
which go with feelings of anger) will just scratch the surface without
an appreciation of what lies beneath. We will all have experienced the
emotions set out below. Remember, though, that what are related here will
be experienced with a level of intensity and duration which will interfere
with the ability to learn. In an educational context, these are the essential
conditions of the E in EBD or (since DfES, 2001) SEBD.


<b>Jealousy</b>


When someone is threatened by the loss of an important relationship with
another person, jealousy ensues. If that loss has been experienced on previous
occasions, perhaps painfully, then jealousy will be even more
deeply felt. Insecurity and fear lie at the root of jealousy  and jealousy
is a prime source of anger. Righteous anger, inhibited anger and hostility
can all arise from jealousy. Although we often associate jealousy with
romantic relationships, it can be found wherever the esteem of others is
concerned. Neu (2000) sees the seeds of jealousy lying in a universal
desire to be desired (2000: 48) or need for affection and to be loved.


Incidents of bullying, particularly where they involve the social exclusion
of a child, may have at their roots anger motivated by jealousy. Name-calling,
sullying the reputation of the target child, getting that child into trouble and
so on can often be driven by fear that the child in question will take something
special away from already valued relationships. More than many
children realize, at a conscious level, their relationships with others confirm
who they are: whether they are interesting, clever, witty, cool, good at
games or whatever. A threat to those relationships is a threat to that confirmation.
Jealousy and its associated emotion of fear  fear that something is
about to be taken away that may not be recoverable  can often be found
within aggression directed at members of a social group. In its extreme, jealous
anger can be a very powerful force indeed. The sense of hurt which
often accompanies it can lead both to angry feelings and sadness.


<b>Depression/sadness</b>


There is no shortage of literature reporting hostility and anger displayed
by depressed adults and depressed children (Berkowitz, 2001). Typically,

[p. <i>96</i>]

Berkowitz (2001), however, has suggested that many sad experiences,
particularly those involving loss and the emotion of grief associated with
that loss, lead to outward displays of anger and so to aggressive behaviour.
He raises the reasonable argument that feeling very sad will make
people angry, thereby making them quite likely to look for someone outside
of themselves to blame and to project their aggression onto. From this
perspective a child who is somehow on a hair trigger for anger, whose
unpredictability makes it likely that she or he will have outbursts of
temper for no apparent reason, could well be a depressed child.


<b>Shame and guilt</b>


It is easy to think of these emotions as quite distinct from anger. Somehow
they seem private and inward-directed emotions. Yet shame has been
found to be closely linked to aggression in research by Tangney et al.
(2001). Conventional wisdom has it that frustration of a desired goal (that
is, not getting what you want) leads to aggression. However, Tangney and
her co-workers reframed this. The problem, they suggested, lay not in the
frustration itself but in the witnessing of that frustration. Shame, they suggested,
can easily foster anger and so lead to aggression. Their research
with older adolescents indicated that a <i>proneness to shame</i> was consistently
correlated with measures of anger arousal, resentment, irritability
and a tendency to blame others for negative events.


To be ashamed we need to be aware that others know of our shortcomings.
Guilt, on the other hand, is a more private affair. Tangney et al.
(2001) found that what they termed a <i>proneness to shame-free guilt</i> was
unassociated with anger. Put quite simply, it seems that shame can very
easily lead to anger, while guilt appears to be an inward-turning emotion.
Guilty people often try to make things right with those they have
wronged; humiliated people don't.


It is not hard to see how a student failing in school, or who fails to succeed
socially, can develop a sense of shame which becomes continually
reinforced by further frustrating (and therefore humiliating) experiences.
We can expect anger to result. It would be easy to see that anger stemming
from failure and in a way it does. But two conditions attach to any failure:

[p. <i>97</i>]

<b>Envy</b>


The philosopher Jerome Neu (2000) has distinguished two kinds of envy. The
first is <i>malicious envy</i> (wanting to lower the other) and the second <i>admiring
envy</i>, where the individual wants in some way to become like another person.
Both can lead to anger.


At the centre of envy is invidious comparison. An envious person sees
someone else as better off than they should be or they deserve to be. Envy can
attach to qualities (good looks, popularity and so on) or to possessions or
accomplishments. In school, openly expressed envy can lead to the destruction
of property (clothes, books and so on) and to many of the facets of bullying
with which we are familiar. However, there are potentially longer-term consequences.
Envy, perhaps like other negative emotions, can easily be
repressed (Smith, 1991). It becomes what he terms an unsanctioned emotion
(1991: 92). Repressed feelings of envy now lead to a more pervasive
condition: what Nietsche (1887/1967) has termed <i>ressentiment</i>. The essence
of <i>ressentiment</i> is that it seeks out an external hostile world. It's not fair is
the key cognition that underpins it: what is envied cannot be attained and so
the world is an unfriendly place. The philosopher Scheler (1915/1961), too,
has addressed <i>ressentiment</i> as a condition resulting from repressed envy. He
sees general negativity, accompanied by violent and apparently unsystematic
rejection of people and situations, stemming from that condition.


If we look at Table 6.1, it is quite easy to locate the anger which may
be shown by a student whose envy has been generalized into <i>ressentiment</i>.
Inhibited anger and hostility seem good candidates. The shape of such
anger may not always be obvious. Gossiping, denigrating, plotting, non-co-operation
and so on all have their place in defining ill-will. We need,
though, to remember that <i>ressentiment</i> and the anger accompanying it can,
at times, bypass outward hostility (Smith, 1991). In that case resignation
and apathy may actually mask the anger which accompanies envy.


<b>EMOTIONAL PRECISION?</b>


So if there are different kinds of anger and if many apparently angry
episodes owe their existence to other emotional states, does that invalidate
the notion of anger? No; it is an extremely common emotional prototype.
But if we are to conclude that a student's special educational needs are

[p. <i>98</i>]

Some 40 years ago, Gordon Allport drew attention to the common
Latin root (<i>motum</i>) of two words: motive and emotion. Emotions,
observed Allport (1963), move us, just like motives. Violent emotions, he
suggested, are disruptive and seem not to have any adaptive purpose. For
him, emotion was best defined as a stirred up condition of the organism
(1963: 198) and then left alone in his treatise on personality. Yet in his
language we can find echoes of what many students will tell us: He's stirring
me up or I was stirred up are phrases which indicate a commonsense
understanding of what Allport viewed as a signal that things are not
going right with us (1963: 198).


Stirred up emotions are mixed emotions. We seldom just experience one
emotion, even if we think we do. A sense of hurt can be accompanied by
fondness for the person causing that hurt; a sense of fear or insecurity can
easily accompany exhilaration or joy. Mixed emotions are an inevitable part
of life; those who are unable to understand (or integrate) them are said to
experience splitting (Cole et al., 1994), and splitting in adults is seen as an
indicator of personality disorder. Yet difficulty in integrating emotions, in
achieving balance and understanding shades of feelings, is precisely what
many young people labelled EBD experience.


The ability to think and talk about emotion is an important dimension
of self-regulation. Labelling, describing, conceptualizing and understanding
one's feelings is a goal of many therapies. It is therefore disappointing
to find such a one-paced approach to the emotional difficulties of the
young people whose statements I saw. It does not do justice either to them
or to the assessment process that preceded the legal definition of their
special educational needs.


<b>EMOTION RESTRUCTURING</b>


I remarked earlier that restricted ability to think about emotions will make
it difficult to develop a full range of emotional experiences as the young
person grows older. Learning to think and talk about emotional reactions
is a goal of many therapies; the rise in attempts to develop emotional
literacy in both students and teachers can therefore only be welcomed.
Emotions don't usually come singly, though. Greenberg et al. (1995)
recognized this in their work with younger students, placing an emphasis
on the understanding of simultaneous emotions. At a simple level, we can
be sad that we're deprived of something (for example, permission to go

[p. <i>99</i>]

For a child to be formally labelled EBD or SEBD, he or she will
be seen to present considerable challenges at school. Abuse and neglect,
particularly in early childhood, are associated with a cocktail of problems
which include poor cognitive performance, low school attainment
and delinquency (Perez and Widom, 1994). Risk factors which accumulate
and overwhelm a child's capacity for coping, whether long-term
(living in a violent home, violent community, protracted bullying and so
on) or relatively immediate (exposure to a sudden traumatic event such
as fire, homelessness and so forth) are known to cause energy needed for
present conscious activities to be diverted to the replay of past extreme
emotions (Melzak, 1997). Teasing out the emotional pathways which
lead to a child's current simple anger or sadness (the prototypical
emotions of EBD) will not necessarily be an easy activity. But the alternative,
to ignore them or to define them in a simple or even banal way,
dodges the complex motivating forces that generate the behaviours
which are found difficult to handle.


The E in EBD continues to be given little attention within our education
system. Dispositional factors (self-esteem, social competence and so
on) are sometimes seen as providing sufficient focus. There is a case to be
made for working to enhance them; they are not, however, emotions.
Emotions themselves can be worrying things; when others display them
they can easily evoke strong emotions in us, and vice-versa. History has
seen repeated attempts to reduce or eliminate young people's experience
of particular emotions, with anger and fear high on the agenda at most
times (Stearns, 1993). There isn't much evidence for their success. It's
understandable, or course: seemingly unregulated emotions have always
been scary and maybe not mentioning them is preferable to getting too
involved with them. That is why it is often easier to use labels such as
aggressive or antisocial, or to ascribe to children such characteristics
as low self-esteem or poor emotional intelligence.


But as I said at the start of this chapter, emotions are what drive us.
They colour our lives, they fascinate us. The continuing popularity of television
soap dramas bears witness to this. Watch any one for a couple of
episodes and you'll find a whole source of emotional literacy material:
love, jealousy, fear, pride, envy, rage, vengefulness, trepidation, guilt,
remorse, sorrow, greed and a whole host of others occupy our screens.
Most importantly, the characters there have to cope with other people's
displays of emotion; they also have to try (with varying success) to integrate
their own mixed emotions in response to varying events. Plans and

At a simple level, discourse on a child/young person's emotional difficulties
and what might be done about these should engage with at least
the following:


 the prototypical emotion(s) shown (that is, how the child/young
person seems a lot of the time or at times which cause concern);


 the ways in which those emotions are dysfunctional for the child/
young person and others in school;


 from case history, the life events which may lie behind those dysfunctional
emotions;


 how the child/young person currently regulates his or her emotions
(that is, the things that are seen as extreme or inappropriate);


 what difficulties there may be for the child/young person in integrating
mixed emotions;


 what emotions are seldom or never apparent;


 what language is needed to assist the child/young person in emotional
understanding and integration; and


 how the child/young person can be moved closer to accessing a full
range of emotions.


Many children we call EBD seem stuck with one emotional state
which they replay vigorously and often. It isn't enough simply to cite the
emotion that presents itself, however. We need to undertake the difficult
task of understanding the complexity of an apparently simple emotional
state. Otherwise we might as well drop the E altogether in the typologies
used by government, LEAs and schools.
