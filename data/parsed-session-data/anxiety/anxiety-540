WHEN I WAS FIRST AWARE THAT I HAD BEEN LAID
low by the disease, I felt a need, among other things,
to register a strong protest against the word "depression."
Depression, most people know, used to be
termed "melancholia," a word which appears in English

As one who has suffered from the malady in extremis
yet returned to tell the tale, I would lobby for
a truly arresting designation. "Brainstorm," for instance,
has unfortunately been preempted to describe,

The depression that engulfed me was not of the
manic type--the one accompanied by euphoric
highs--which would have most probably presented itself
earlier in my life. I was sixty when the illness
struck for the first time, in the "unipolar" form, which
leads straight down. I shall never learn what "caused"
my depression, as no one will ever learn about their
own. To be able to do so will likely forever prove to be
an impossibility, so complex are the intermingled factors
of abnormal chemistry, behavior and genetics.
Plainly, multiple components are involved--perhaps
three or four, most probably more, in fathomless permutations.

The inevitable question "Why did he [or she] do
it?" usually leads to odd speculations, for the most part
fallacies themselves. Reasons were quickly advanced
for Abbie Hoffman's death: his reaction to an auto
accident he had suffered, the failure of his most recent
book, his mother's serious illness. With Randall Jarrell
it was a declining career cruelly epitomized by a
vicious book review and his consequent anguish. Primo
Levi, it was rumored, had been burdened by caring for
his paralytic mother, which was more onerous to his
spirit than even his experience at Auschwitz. Any one
of these factors may have lodged like a thorn in the
sides of the three men, and been a torment. Such
aggravations may be crucial and cannot be ignored.
But most people quietly endure the equivalent of injuries,
declining careers, nasty book reviews, family
illnesses. A vast majority of the survivors of Auschwitz
have borne up fairly well. Bloody and bowed by the
outrages of life, most human beings still stagger on
down the road, unscathed by real depression. To discover
why some people plunge into the downward spiral

The storm which swept me into a hospital in December
began as a cloud no bigger than a wine goblet
the previous June. And the cloud--the manifest
crisis--involved alcohol, a substance I had been abusing
for forty years. Like a great many American writers,
whose sometimes lethal addiction to alcohol has
become so legendary as to provide in itself a stream of
studies and books, I used alcohol as the magical conduit
to fantasy and euphoria, and to the enhancement
of the imagination. There is no need to either rue or
apologize for my use of this soothing, often sublime
agent, which had contributed greatly to my writing;
although I never set down a line while under its influence,
I did use it--often in conjunction with
music--as a means to let my mind conceive visions
that the unaltered, sober brain has no access to. Alcohol
was an invaluable senior partner of my intellect,
besides being a friend whose ministrations I sought
daily--sought also, I now see, as a means to calm the
anxiety and incipient dread that I had hidden away for
so long somewhere in the dungeons of my spirit.


The trouble was, at the beginning of this particular

Neither by will nor by choice had I became an abstainer;
the situation was puzzling to me, but it was
also traumatic, and I date the onset of my depressive
mood from the beginning of this deprivation. Logically,
one would be overjoyed that the body had so
summarily dismissed a substance that was undermining
its health; it was as if my system had generated a
form of Antabuse, which should have allowed me to
happily go my way, satisfied that a trick of nature had

It was not really alarming at first, since the change
was subtle, but I did notice that my surroundings took
on a different tone at certain times: the shadows of
nightfall seemed more somber, my mornings were less
buoyant, walks in the woods became less zestful, and
there was a moment during my working hours in the
late afternoon when a kind of panic and anxiety overtook
me, just for a few minutes, accompanied by a visceral
queasiness--such a seizure was at least slightly alarming,
after all. As I set down these recollections, I realize
that it should have been plain to me that I was already
in the grip of the beginning of a mood disorder, but I
was ignorant of such a condition at that time.


When I reflected on this curious alteration of my consciousness --
and I was baffled enough from time to time
to do so--I assumed that it all had to do somehow with
my enforced withdrawal from alcohol. And, of course,

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353302-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was on Martha's Vineyard, where I've spent a good
part of each year since the 1960s, during that exceptionally
beautiful summer. But I had begun to respond
indifferently to the island's pleasures. I felt a kind of
numbness, an enervation, but more particularly an odd
fragility--as if my body had actually become frail,
hypersensitive and somehow disjointed and clumsy,
lacking normal coordination. And soon I was in the
throes of a pervasive hypochondria. Nothing felt quite
right with my corporeal self; there were twitches and
pains, sometimes intermittent, often seemingly constant,

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353302-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my case, the overall effect was immensely disturbing,
augmenting the anxiety that was by now
never quite absent from my waking hours and fueling
still another strange behavior pattern--a fidgety restlessness
that kept me on the move, somewhat to the
perplexity of my family and friends. Once, in late
summer, on an airplane trip to New York, I made the
reckless mistake of downing a scotch and soda--my
first alcohol in months--which promptly sent me into
a tailspin, causing me such a horrified sense of disease

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353302-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By now I had moved back to my house in Connecticut.
It was October, and one of the unforgettable
features of this stage of my disorder was the way in
which my own farmhouse, my beloved home for thirty
years, took on for me at that point when my spirits
regularly sank to their nadir an almost palpable quality
of ominousness. The fading evening light--akin to
that famous "slant of light" of Emily Dickinson's,
which spoke to her of death, of chill extinction--had
none of its familiar autumnal loveliness, but ensnared
me in a suffocating gloom. I wondered how this
friendly place, teeming with such memories of (again
in her words) "Lads and Girls," of "laughter and ability
and Sighing, / And Frocks and Curls," could almost
perceptibly seem so hostile and forbidding.
Physically, I was not alone. As always Rose was present
and listened with unflagging patience to my complaints.

There were also dreadful, pouncing seizures of anxiety.
One bright day on a walk through the woods
with my dog I heard a flock of Canada geese honking
high above trees ablaze with foliage; ordinarily a sight
and sound that would have exhilarated me, the flight
of birds caused me to stop, riveted with fear, and I
stood stranded there, helpless, shivering, aware for the
first time that I had been stricken by no mere pangs of
withdrawal but by a serious illness whose name and
actuality I was able finally to acknowledge. Going
home, I couldn't rid my mind of the line of Baudelaire's,
dredged up from the distant past, that for several
days had been skittering around at the edge of my
consciousness: "I have felt the wind of the wing of
madness."


Our perhaps understandable modern need to dull
the sawtooth edges of so many of the afflictions we are
heir to has led us to banish the harsh old-fashioned
words: madhouse, asylum, insanity, melancholia, lunatic,
madness. But never let it be doubted that depression,

That fall, as the disorder gradually took full possession
of my system, I began to conceive that my mind

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353302-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is a well-known checklist of some of these
functions and their failures. Mine conked out fairly
close to schedule, many of them following the pattern
of depressive seizures. I particularly remember the lamentable
near disappearance of my voice. It underwent
a strange transformation, becoming at times quite
faint, wheezy and spasmodic--a friend observed later
that it was the voice of a ninety-year-old. The libido
also made an early exit, as it does in most major
illnesses--it is the superfluous need of a body in beleaguered
emergency. Many people lose all appetite;
mine was relatively normal, but I found myself eating
only for subsistence: food, like everything else within
the scope of sensation, was utterly without savor. Most
distressing of all the instinctual disruptions was that of
sleep, along with a complete absence of dreams.


Exhaustion combined with sleeplessness is a rare
torture. The two or three hours of sleep I was able to
get at night were always at the behest of the Halcion --
a matter which deserves particular notice. For some

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353302-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At any rate, my few hours of sleep were usually
terminated at three or four in the morning, when I
stared up into yawning darkness, wondering and
writhing at the devastation taking place in my mind,
and awaiting the dawn, which usually permitted me a
feverish, dreamless nap. I'm fairly certain that it was

What I had begun to discover is that, mysteriously
and in ways that are totally remote from normal experience,
the gray drizzle of horror induced by depression
takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not
an immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken
limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair,
owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by
the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical
discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated
room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron,
because there is no escape from this smothering confinement,
it is entirely natural that the victim begins
to think ceaselessly of oblivion.
