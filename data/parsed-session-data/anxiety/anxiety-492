I first learned about Ayelet when she was 15 years old. Her parents
came to my private clinic to consult with me, telling me that they had
a daughter with ‘some not-too-serious problems, a kind of eating
disorder’, who was an out-patient in a nearby hospital (her first). At
that hospital, she was being treated with medications and group
therapy. They wanted me to accept their daughter for treatment, in
order to expedite her discharge, but I refused. My refusal was based
first on the fact that I was under the strong influence of the need to
hospitalize another anorexic girl I was treating. It was a very
traumatic experience for me. I had lost many nights' sleep recently,
worrying about her, doubting whether there was anything I could do
to avoid hospitalization, fearing how she would make it. Second, I
thought it was inappropriate to interfere with the staff working at
that hospital. Third, I was not really sure that I was being told the
whole truth about Ayelet's condition, so I did not want to get
involved.


Ayelet and her parents came to me again four years later. They
reported that Ayelet had been hospitalized for most of the intervening
time in four different hospitals, one of which had been a
placement by court order from the district psychiatric court of law At
the time of this meeting with me, Ayelet had been out of the hospital
for three months and claimed to be fine. However, she had many
problems and urgently needed therapy. The psychiatrist who was
treating her at that time was dying, and Ayelet was in a state of crisis
from the fear of his impending death. Together, we counted
twenty-four different medications she had received over the last six
years (three years at home and three hospitalized) and ten different

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet, even before receiving the medical and psychiatric evaluations
about her condition, my inclination was to refuse accepting her for
treatment. I felt uncertain as to whether I could help where so many
good therapists before me could not. However, I saw Ayelet in my
clinic that day in 1994, sitting in the corner as if she were trying to
make herself invisible. She was a beautiful, fragile, almost
20-year-old girl, who was nearly smiling and looked almost unreal.
The only thing about her that showed vitality and life were her eyes.
Big, shining eyes looking at me miserably. On the spot, I felt myself
fall in love with this girl. She seemed to me to be brimming with a
special inner and outer beauty and grace, despite her afflictions. Now,
almost seven years later, she has become much more than a client to
me. I care for her dearly. I think I have learned more from her than she
has learned from me. We have traveled down a long path together and
even now, when she is married, we have finished writing this book,
and she is the mother of two beautiful children (a son aged two and a
six-month-old daughter), we keep meeting once every two or three
months, just to maintain contact.


I treated Ayelet for about four years. I started with joint sessions for
her and her parents together in the period after her discharge from the
hospital; I counseled her parents; we continued with family therapy; I
turned to individual therapy with her; and then I held counseling
sessions with Ayelet and her young husband. I think it is worth telling
Ayelet's story because it incorporates all kinds of intervention settings
(parent supervision, family therapy, individual therapy, and couple
counseling) and a wide variety of techniques (verbal therapy, storytelling,
imagery, metaphors, exposure, and more). Her story is one of
my hesitation and confusion as a therapist, as well as my optimism,

From my earliest encounter with this family, I estimated that an intake
interview on their complex family history would necessitate at least
several hours. Due to the urgent need to treat Ayelet, I started by collecting
only the basic information and then, throughout our work
together, I continued gathering details. Even now, during the process
of writing this book, after treating Ayelet for several years, I learned
some new particulars about her past. For the sake of clarity here, I will
present the family history and Ayelet's background as one concise
story.


Ayelet is the middle child in a family of three daughters. Her older
sister is two and a half years older than Ayelet. This sister was always
described by Ayelet as the ideal of success and strength, as someone
who knew what she wanted and how to achieve it. This sister played a
major role in Ayelet's feelings of competitiveness and worthlessness
as a child. At the onset of therapy, this sister was living with a
boyfriend and studying at the university, and Ayelet was not on
speaking terms with her. Later on during therapy, that sister returned
home and, sometime afterwards, got married. Ayelet and her older
sister gave birth to children at the same time, and, as we terminated
treatment, Ayelet had started developing a nice relationship with her.


The other sister, 11 years younger than Ayelet, was born after the
mother had many miscarriages, and this daughter was very
pampered. During the years when Ayelet was in and out of hospitals,
her young sister did not figure prominently in her life, although the
parents reported that Ayelet talked often at the time of her love and
concern for her younger sister. As we started therapy, Ayelet frequently
felt disturbed about her then eight-year-old sister, worrying

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The mother, 50 years old at the time of their referral, was born in
Israel. Her parents are Holocaust survivors from Hungary. Her father
(Ayelet's grandfather) spent the war at a work camp near Budapest,
gathering the dead people. He met Ayelet's grandmother in Hungary
after the war, before immigrating to Israel. The couple spent some
time together in Cyprus after their boat was denied entry to Israel,
and eventually they managed to immigrate to Israel where they and
their children and grandchildren (including Ayelet and her family)
live until this day. The family history is still not clear, since it is
something they do not wish to talk about, and do not voluntarily
share with their children and grandchildren. Ayelet is very close to
her grandparents. She respects them greatly and often shares with
them things she wouldn't share with her own parents.


I still have very limited information even about the parents themselves.
Although they are very nice, cooperative people, they do not
talk about themselves. They were each raised in an atmosphere of not
sharing emotions or problems with other people, and, even with me,
they would not share information unless I asked or even demanded to
know details.


Ayelet's mother was a preschool/kindergarten teacher for many
years, until around the time we started therapy, when she decided to
continue her studies toward a bachelor's degree. She began working
in an elementary school, and now serves as the school principal,
where she is very successful. She is a good-looking woman who is
highly intelligent and very easy to relate to. She is also a very
dominant figure in the family. In her relationship with Ayelet, she is
very sensitive but at the same time very ambivalent, and often sends
double messages. She suffers from many anxieties; however, they do
not appear pathological but rather as over-anxious and over-protective
behaviors, worries, and fears, relating to the things and people

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ayelet's father is a very gentle, quiet man who listens carefully but
almost never expresses his opinions. He was a good-looking man at
53 years of age at the time of their referral. He was born in Romania.
During Nazi rule, his father was imprisoned, and he was raised by his
mother and her sister. He came to Israel at the age of 15 with a group
of teenage immigrants. He served in the military for many years and
then continued his higher education. He works as an engineer.


<b>Ayelet's History</b>


Ayelet was born prematurely in the seventh month of pregnancy,
during the Yom Kippur War. After a difficult breech labor (just as her
mother and her son were born), Ayelet had no spontaneous respiration
at birth and required resuscitation. She weighed 4 pounds 3
ounces at birth and spent her first month of life in an incubator. Later,
her psychomotoric development was slow. She started walking at one
year and seven months old, but started talking on time at around one
year old. From birth, she had problems with her digestion. She cried
and vomited frequently, and she stopped breathing for short times.
The parents reported it was not easy to raise her, and they were very
tense about her response to anything new. At the age of three, the
vomiting and fainting disappeared. She began to love eating, especially
junk food, but she was not overweight.


When Ayelet was less than two years old, she was enrolled in the
preschool where her mother taught. The mother reported that, as a
child, Ayelet always envied the other children for getting her
mother's attention, and she used to ask her mother if she loved her
more than she loved the other kids who were there. At that time,
Ayelet could not stand to be separated from her mother.


In the other years of preschool, Ayelet became accustomed to
being among children, but was always very quiet, had only one or
two friends, and was mostly occupied with drawing or playing alone.
The parents do not remember any specific problems from those years.

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The parents described her as someone who was always very
dependent and constantly in need of physical touch. She wanted her
mother to hold her hand or hug her; she always needed proof of
being loved.


<i>Development of the Illness</i>


The history of Ayelet's illness began with her dieting at the age of 14,
which began from an initial weight of 123 pounds and would drop to
a weight of 93 pounds at the worst time. After Ayelet's first 22 pound
loss and cessation of menstruation, the school counselor raised her
concerns in a talk with Ayelet's parents. I tried to understand how and
why Ayelet's parents refused to cooperate with the school counselor
and did not agree to take Ayelet to therapy then. When I asked them
about this, they answered that Ayelet had always been concerned
with her eating, and that they thought the counselor at school was
too anxious. They did not believe Ayelet was anorexic, and for a long
time Ayelet actually deceived them. Some of their sorrow related to
the fact that they were not aware of her serious condition earlier. The
couple related how they often argued whether she was really sick or
just pretending to be. Only while listening to them could I understand
how difficult it was for these parents to accept the fact that their
beautiful, smart daughter was ill. In addition, after getting to know
Ayelet better later, I learned how manipulative she could be, how convincing
she could sound, and how good she could be in deceiving
others. Therefore, it took time before the parents realized that she was

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The ensuing treatment history included a long list of hospitals and
treatments that were ineffective in generating a behavioral stabilization
of her weight and testified to a gradual systematic deterioration
in her emotional, behavioral, and social functioning. Ayelet started
treatment in group therapy and, at the same time, her parents
attended a parents group in the psychiatric unit of a general hospital.
The parents' talked about how difficult it was for them to be part of
this parents' group. They could not identify with the other parents
and did not feel it helped them at all. As Ayelet left her group and
started individual therapy at the same hospital, the parents described
their feelings as moving from anger to empathy, from hope to helplessness.
They admitted that, when they understood that Ayelet was
not improving, they thought it might be because of the setting. They
feared that Ayelet, a sensitive girl, would only learn to imitate other
psychiatric patients and become sicker.


Her parents sent her to a third type of therapy, to a private psychologist
who applied a very strict eating regimen. They hoped that there,
with a more pleasant atmosphere on the one hand, and a very strict
eating program on the other hand, she might recover. Indeed, Ayelet
gained 18 pounds, and her parents agreed to stop therapy. For a
while, they were sure Ayelet had recovered. They were especially
fooled by the fact that she continued being a good student. They
thought that getting good grades was a sign that she was healthy.
When Ayelet started losing weight again, they thought it was because
she was studying hard for her matriculation examinations. But then,
at the age of 17, Ayelet took an overdose of medications, and they had
to hospitalize her. Even then, they could not accept the fact that she
had tried to commit suicide and insisted it was an accident; and they
insisted on her being hospitalized in a general rather than a psychiatric
hospital, where she stayed for two months.


I believe Ayelet's parents denied her illness in part out of shame
and fear of stigma, and in part due to their feelings of guilt or

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ayelet's parents described the short time that Ayelet stayed at
home as a very stressful period. They admitted that they had no idea
how to handle her. They argued severely about what would be the
right way to go about dealing with her. They also feared that she
might influence her younger sister. They shifted between the wish to
have her with them and to take care of her, and the wish to have her
taken away so that they could try to return to a normal life. They
could never rest when she was around, always fearing she would
harm herself and never sure how to treat her. Shortly afterwards,
Ayelet was hospitalized again in another psychiatric hospital, this
time in the adolescence department, where she spent eight months
and was in isolation twice.


Ayelet began therapy with me after leaving the last hospital. Since
that time, she had no further hospitalizations, nor did she use psychiatric
medications of any kind. At first, she still used laxatives and
medications to induce vomiting, but soon she ceased these as well.

<font size="4"><b>3: Collecting an Inventory of Ayelet's Problems and Establishing an Initial Treatment Contract</b></font>
[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ayelet's case seemed so complex that I did not know where and how
to begin. The list of well-known therapists who had treated her in the
past did not help me feel good about my ability to help her, nor did
the long list of hospitalizations and medications. However, from the
start, some intuitive feeling led me to sense that although Ayelet was
confused and seemed to reject therapy, she was also very naive and
was hoping to be helped and be able to trust someone. It was also
obvious that she was sick and tired of treatment and therapy.
Therefore, I thought I should first mobilize her interest and collaboration.
I also understood that she was a seasoned expert in techniques
and treatments, and she knew what therapists expected her to say. I
did not want to become just another name on that long list from her
past.


I knew also about the past attempts to change the way Ayelet
thought of herself, to persuade her to gain weight, and to induce her
to start believing that she was thin. These were some things I did not
want to repeat.


What was clear to me was that, in some way during that first
session, she made me believe in her positive resources. Early on, I was
impressed by her capacities, her creativity, her somewhat innocent
view of the world, her wish to be good, and her desire to change.
Although Ayelet seemed to be a difficult, stubborn, and rigid client,
who survived ten therapists and hadn't been changed dramatically, I

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In that first session with Ayelet and her parents, I laid out my
approach, telling her, ‘Listen, I am not going to change you or your
problems. I believe you are strong enough to do this by yourself.
What I <i>am</i> going to do is to propose to you that, together, we will try
to find out what you wish, what you need, and how you want it. Then,
together, we will try to help you fulfill what you wish for yourself
Ayelet trapped me immediately, asking, ‘And what if you find out that
what I really want is to die? Will you help me then?’ Her parents
started shouting, but I asked them not to interfere, and I replied, ‘I
don't believe that is what you genuinely want, because you've
survived so much agony that if you really wanted to die, you could
have done so long ago. Instead, I believe you are strong and fighting
to live your life your own way, and that is very understandable.’ Ayelet
smiled and moved her head. I thought that it was a good starting
point and we could progress to make a preliminary contract.


Ayelet's inventory of problematic areas, pain, and suffering was so
lengthy that I could not find a way to unravel all of the information in
order to decide on a treatment plan. As I had no idea where I wanted
to start her therapy, and I knew there were a multitude of problems, I
decided I must introduce some order by selecting how to begin and
how to end. I view therapy as a planned, designed process, and I
believe that due attention should be paid by therapists to the construction
of the intervention process (Ronen 1997a).


Using Gambrill's 12 steps of intervention as guidelines (Gambrill,
Thomas and Carter 1971; see the detailed description in Part V of
this book), I began to design how I would conduct Ayelet's therapeutic
process. The first step in that procedure comprises making an
inventory of problem areas, based on the rationale that such an
inventory will help draw up a profile of the client's difficulties.

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I told Ayelet: ‘I don't need to tell you that you have enough
problems for ten therapists. In order for me to find my way through, I
need some help. So let's draw a map of the difficulties you face in all
the areas of your life and try to assess what's going on.’ It took us the
whole session, but together, we compiled the following description:


1. Personal problems


(a) Eating disorders


Ayelet is afraid of gaining weight, vomits after she has
eaten, uses too many laxative medications, withholds
bowel movements, and cannot eat in her family's
presence.


(b) Fears, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)


Ayelet cannot walk in the street, is afraid to go out
alone, and cannot ride a bus. She demonstrates
obsessive-compulsive disorder, manifested mainly as a
counting compulsion but also as obsessive thoughts,
believing that she is harming everyone who is in close
contact with her. (As an example, she told me about her
grandmother who died, and about the psychiatrist with
whom she was very close and who was dying from a
brain tumor.)


(c) Self-acceptance and self-evaluation


Relating to her emotions, Ayelet feels hopeless and
helpless, bored, and lonely. She thinks she is worthless
and describes overwhelming feelings of anxiety, fear,
depression, and sorrow.


2. Vocational problems


As Ayelet has not attended school regularly for several years,
she has lost confidence in her ability to learn a profession. She
wants to study but is afraid of doing so and feels incompetent.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

3. Social problems


Ayelet has been away from home for many years and has not
participated in social activities or maintained social contacts
throughout most of her adolescence. Most of her friends are
girls from the hospital. She is ashamed to try and communicate
with her old friends, fearing what they might think of her, and
feeling that she does not know how to start connecting with
others. Ayelet is afraid of meeting new people, and she avoids
social contact.


4. Family problems


Much blame, suspicion, anger, and guilt feelings of all the
family members toward one another are evident. Her parents
are not sure how to handle Ayelet, shifting from being afraid
to harm her and treating her as if she were made of glass, to
blaming her for ruining their lives.


This was only a preliminary list, and we could have added much more,
but Ayelet was frightened by its length, so I decided to stop at that
time.


<b>A Preliminary Treatment Contract</b>


I next continued with Gambrill et al.'s (1971) second step of intervention
-- problem selection and contract (see the detailed process in Part
V of this book). I suggested we start from the ‘easiest thing’ first: the
family relations and roles. My impression was that, although there
were many mixed feelings in the family, they really cared for each
other and could support each other. Also, I thought Ayelet would
need a great deal of help and a reliable support system to contribute to
her coping outside the hospital. I also realized that the parents were
very confused, felt frustrated, and were not sure how to treat Ayelet.
Therefore, I shared my impression with them, proposing that we
begin treatment in two settings: parental supervision and family
therapy. I recommended incorporating individual therapy with

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There were, however, some preliminary guidelines I knew I had to
have. I knew that in order to treat Ayelet confidently, I must be
convinced that she was not in danger of losing more weight or risking
her life. I therefore demanded two conditions for treating her: regular
check-ups by a physician and examination by a psychiatrist per need.
Ayelet promised in our treatment contract to meet the family
physician for monthly check-ups. This would ensure that her weight
was appropriate and that she was functioning well physically. I also
insisted on her agreeing to undergo examination by a colleague of
mine -- a child psychiatrist whom I trusted -- whenever I felt the need
for consultation. During the first six months, I turned to him twice.
The first time she was completely confused and seemed to be
psychotic, and he thought this was due to changes in electrolyte homeostasis
in her brain as a result of her previous starvation. The
second time he took her off all medications, thinking she could
function well without them. We never consulted him again after that
second visit, and as I mentioned above, Ayelet never used medications
again.


We decided that we would not talk about her eating habits as a
focus of therapy, but that at the end of each session she would briefly
report what was happening during the week in that domain and
whether there was any change in her eating disorders.

<font size="4"><b>4: Rationale for the Decision to Treat Ayelet Using Multi-Targeted Cognitive-Constructivist Therapy</b></font>
[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decided to design a cognitive-behavioral intervention. The treatment
was directed at three main issues:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Ayelet's anxiety-related disorders (obsessions, compulsions,
anxiety, and fears), which had developed during the
hospitalizations.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Her skill deficits (lack of a vocation, lack of social
relationships, and conflict in family relationships), which had
increased in part as a result of her hospitalizations.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Her misconceptions relating to herself and the world, which
had always been a part of her, and were chiefly responsible for
the development of the anorexia.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
I thought cognitive-constructivist therapy should be the treatment of
choice. I conceived cognitive-constructivist therapy as the umbrella
approach that would facilitate the application of different techniques
for Ayelet's different problem areas. I planned to incorporate a family
intervention to improve her familial relationships and resolve family
conflicts (Foster and Robin 1988); exposure techniques to eliminate
the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Marks 1969, 1978,
1987; Salkovskis 1996); exposure and skill acquisition to reduce
fears and anxieties (Rachman 1997; Ronen 1996; Thyer 1991);
social skills training to help her in vocational and social situations
(Hops and Greenwood 1988; Thyer 1991); self-control intervention

This multiple-treatment design that encompassed crucial life skills
and targeted the client as well as her environment aimed to empower
Ayelet (Mahoney 1991, 1993) by imparting to her the range of skills
she needed to help herself (Ronen 1995, 1997b). I expected that
cognitive-constructive therapy as the treatment of choice would
enable me to help Ayelet help herself, rather than making her feel
helpless, weak, and dependent on the therapist. Early on, I identified
my major objective in treating her in terms of attempting to try and
show Ayelet that she was strong, that she could make decisions about
her life, and that it was up to her to make something out of ‘all the
mess’ she had experienced. I believed that by working with her, mobilizing
her strengths and resources, and utilizing her creative way of
thinking, we could reach the goals of helping her find the ‘real Ayelet’
-- a beautiful, sensitive, intelligent, strong girl.

<font size="4"><b>5: Specifying Target Behaviors and Measuring Baseline Functioning</b></font>
[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fourth step in the intervention process comprises specification of
target behaviors related to the specific selected problem areas
(Gambrill <i>et al</i>. 1971). In this step, details are specified about each
selected behavior problem, in order to demonstrate what maintains
and reinforces the behavior. The following, fifth step consists of determining
the baseline level of the targeted behaviors. Kazdin (1982)
emphasized the importance of baseline information for validating the
data collection, and for ascertaining in depth all the antecedents,
maintenance, and outcomes relating to the behavior. In our intake
session, I asked Ayelet to observe herself over the next two weeks
with regard to each of the major problems that we had identified and
to rate the intensity and frequency of each. I thought these records
would provide baseline data and would enable decision making as to
where and how to begin therapy. Her parents were also asked to chart
Ayelet's different disorders for the same two-week period. They were
asked to note whether the problem appeared or not, and to rate its
frequency. Ayelet also rated the problems on relevant self-rated
comfort scales of 0 to 10.


For the purpose of these baseline records, we divided her problems
into several topics: eating disorders; family interactions; OCD;
anxiety and fear; vocational study or work; social interaction; and,
finally, feeling good about herself.

<i>Eating disorders</i>


The first issue -- Ayelet's eating disorders -- was viewed similarly by all
three respondents (Ayelet and her mother and father). They all
reported that during the previous two weeks, Ayelet refused to sit
down and eat with the family. Ayelet reported that she still vomited
when she ate (at least once a day), used too many laxative medications
(daily), and withheld bowel movements. The only time she was
willing to join the family for a meal was on Friday nights, when her
grandparents came over for dinner.


<i>Family problems</i>


Ayelet was asked to rate the family atmosphere on a self-rating scale
ranging from 0 (coldness, indifference, no physical touch) to 10
(happiness, love, affection, physical touch like hugging and kissing).
Ayelet reported that between five and six times each week there had
been occasions of shouting and snapping at each other, as well as
noted feelings of suspiciousness, frustration, helplessness, and
distrust. The parents agreed with her report. The father said he had
not spoken with Ayelet beyond ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’. The mother
recounted talks related to functional needs. Ayelet reported: ‘No
honest talk with them.’ No one reported any physical touch, and the
atmosphere did not surpass a rating of ‘3’.


<i>OCD, fear, and anxiety</i>


Ayelet's anxiety prevented her from functioning normally. Ayelet
reported she was anxious for most of the day, rating her anxiety
between 1-3 on a scale of 0 (very anxious) to 10 (very calm). Her obsessions
were focused mainly on the fear of a death among her loved
ones. Her compulsions revolved around constant counting, especially
when she saw by chance something written on death or dying in the
newspaper, or when she accidentally thought of something bad that
could happen to her relatives.


Ayelet's anxieties and fears severely restricted her behavior. She
was afraid to leave home. Her parents reported that she did so only to

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Vocational problems</i>


Ayelet wanted to study but was afraid to do so and felt incompetent.
For her baseline records, Ayelet was asked to write down whether she
did anything relating to a future occupation, such as looking at the
classifieds in the newspaper, making telephone calls to inquire into
such advertisements, going to her school to ask for her graduation
records, taking an examination for acceptance to a course of study,
etc. However, during those two weeks she had done nothing but sit at
home. She was not even ready to think about studying, and this unreadiness
only raised her anxiety.


<i>Social contacts</i>


The only youngsters with whom Ayelet had any relations during the
previous four years were friends from the various hospitals. During
the baseline period, she had no social contacts. She never called a
peer, never received a telephone call, and never left home to go to a
party, a movie, or a friend's house.


<i>Self-evaluation and self-acceptance</i>


Ayelet felt hopeless and helpless, bored, and lonely. She thought she
was worthless and could not stand herself. These feelings appeared in
her charts daily. The most severe emotion charted down was her
feeling of emptiness and the thought that there was nothing good
waiting for her in the future and, therefore, that there was no hope in
life. Still, she did not present any thought of suicide or wish to die.


The analyses of the baseline data enabled our continuation into the
sixth step of intervention: the identification of problem-controlling

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Steps 7, 8, and 9, relating to the beginning of intervention,
consisted of: assessment of resources one has in the environment and
within oneself; specification of behavioral objectives for intervention;
and formulation of the treatment plan (Gambrill <i>et al</i>. 1971) (see the
detailed description in Part V). Our treatment plan (step 9) included
the kind of disorders we would address, the sequence of treatment,
the way therapy would be conducted, and its structure in terms of her
agreement to meet her family physician for monthly check-ups and to
visit a child psychiatrist per need. Throughout the intervention
process, we continuously monitored outcomes to furnish feedback on
effectiveness and to enhance Ayelet's motivation (step 11) and took
steps to maintain the changes achieved (step 12).


As we had decided, we began with family intervention.

<font size="4"><b>6: Family Intervention</b></font>
[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The family meetings were conducted in ten family sessions held twice
weekly with Ayelet and her parents. Although she had two sisters,
Ayelet and her parents did not want them to be involved and rejected
my attempt to invite them to join us, emphasizing that ‘they are not
part of this’.


Foster and Robin's (1988) proposal that negative emotions are
both a product and a component of a maladaptive interaction style
corresponded aptly to Ayelet's family. The family intervention,
therefore, aimed at helping the family members deal with those
negative emotions, learn to express their feelings, and change their
communication styles.


I used Foster and Robin's (1988) methods of working with
families. In one method, the family members were asked to present a
problem and then to look for regularly recurring sequences of family
interaction that adequately depict the presenting problem within the
overall context of the way in which their family operates. These three
family members tended to blame each other for their distress and to
feel a great deal of fear of and anger toward one another. In these
sessions, they learned to express feelings, to practice talking directly
to one another, and to look directly into each other's eyes. Later, they
were assigned to do things together as a family, such as going to
movies and on walks, without mentioning or talking about ‘the
problem’, referring to Ayelet's sickness and hospitalization. They also
practiced demonstrating physical affection (touching each other's
arms, holding hands, hugging).


A second method consisted of working on a meaningful answer to
the question: ‘What is each member of the family getting out of the

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At first, it was difficult for all three family members to talk about
their feelings. Ayelet especially blamed her parents for putting her in
the hospital. She shared with them the fears she felt then and yelled at
them for abandoning her there to be alone and lonely. Her parents
wept while talking about how helpless they had felt, how they had
been afraid they would lose her, and how they had been ready to do
anything in order to keep her alive. They revealed to her and to each
other how they blamed themselves for the development of her
problem, and they described how they had been constantly oscillating
from distress and despair to hope, and back again.


In these sessions, Ayelet would direct herself to me, referring to her
parents in the third person (e.g. ‘He just left me there...’). She would
say to me, ‘I'll leave the room, and I want you to ask them what they
really feel about me. They won't say if I'm here.’ Nevertheless, as I
modeled sharing difficult feelings, they began to do so. I asked Ayelet
to sit in front of her parents, look directly in their eyes, and tell them
directly what she felt. During the first two family sessions, she left the
room in the middle, telling her parents she would wait for them
outside. In the third session, she said she was ready to talk with her
mother but not with her father. I saw Ayelet had an enormous amount
of complaints but was afraid to talk about them. She accepted my suggestion
that she stand up and say everything she had to say against
her parents, all at once, and get it over with.


We had a very difficult fifth session when each of them turned to
the other, spurting out what made him or her the most angry. There
were tears, anger, and shouting.


In the sixth session, I asked all of them to write letters to each
other, telling one another about their wishes and fantasies. At first,
Ayelet wrote to her father: ‘I wish you yourself would stay in a mental
hospital for one month.’ But, as we progressed that day she could

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was at that stage of the treatment that I began suggesting that
they start doing things together as a family. They were instructed to
go to movies and on walks, without mentioning or talking about ‘the
problem’. Gradually, the family seemed to be beginning to function
as a family again. Ayelet never stopped criticizing her parents for their
previous behavior, but at the same time she could admit how difficult
she was to relate to, and that she would not have known what to do if
she had been in their place. She could also say that it was not their
fault that she was anorexic, and that she could accept and agree with
their need to hospitalize her, although it was a very traumatic experience
for her.


As they progressed, they were able to talk about their feelings not
only in my presence but also at home. After the first ten meetings,
Ayelet began individual therapy, and we continued meeting as a
family once every six to eight weeks to deal with issues that arose.

<font size="4"><b>7: Parent Counseling</b></font>
[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Throughout the first year of treating Ayelet, I met with her parents
once every three to four weeks for a consultation and supervision
session. I started counseling them as we finished the family therapy
and I started seeing Ayelet individually. We discussed how to deal
with her various behaviors, how to respond to her eating habits, to
what extent she could be asked by them to take on responsibilities in
the house, and how to increase her independence. The parents were
very confused, wanted help, and did their best to follow my suggestions.
They tried to help her feel welcome at home and return to
‘normal family life’. Often, they would call me to consult on how to
deal with specific incidents, especially when something in her
behavior frightened them. However, though Ayelet did not eat
normally yet, she did not wish to die. Gradually, they realized her life
was no longer in jeopardy, and they started trusting her, interfering
less in her life, and allowing her more independence.


During the parents' sessions, we looked at the family relations.
According to her parents, Ayelet was angry with them both, but she
felt it much easier to accept her father's way of behaving than her
mother's. She was very close to her mother, and she viewed her
mother's ‘abandoning her at the hospital’ as a betrayal. Ayelet could
not talk with her mother about this, but the mother sensed it, and
found it difficult to talk in the sessions about what it had been like for
her to hospitalize her daughter. The parents reported that Ayelet was
also angry because her ‘sickness’ was a secret kept from people, and
she felt her parents were ashamed of her.


The mother's intellectualization and emphasis on a cognitive
pattern of thinking and behaving were striking to me, and were completely

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The assignment included interviewing her daughter, reading
about the disorder, and sharing her own feelings. These helped her
accept the problem of anorexia as one which was shared by other
people. Instead of blaming herself, the mother found a sense of
achievement and joy in the fact that they had overcome the disorder
and made it out of the hospital with a healthy, living daughter. The
mother was required to interview Ayelet for many hours, in an
attempt to learn from Ayelet's point of view what her experiences and
feelings had been. Both of them cried and opened up, enabling a shift
from communicating on an intellectual level to an emotional one.
Trying to understand themselves and the problem better, they
became ready to accept and forgive one another, in a wish to develop
a new relationship. When they finished, they gave me a copy of the
assignment.


The father, also, learned to express his love for Ayelet (by holding
her hand, smiling at her, not criticizing her). As he followed my instructions
not to talk about her problems but rather to find other
common areas to talk and share feelings about, their relationship
improved remarkably.

<font size="4"><b>8: Beginning Individual Therapy with Ayelet</b></font>
[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About nine weeks after the family came to me, following the initial
family treatment and separate parent counseling, I started treating
Ayelet individually. I obtained Ayelet's agreement to meet with me for
weekly individual sessions. I also made myself available to her by
telephone between sessions. As we initiated this stage of therapy,
Ayelet was very suspicious and cynical, did not trust me, and often
gave me the feeling she was not there at all. She was talking, and on
the surface everything sounded fine, but I did not feel any emotion, as
if her mouth and head were detached from her pain and her feelings.


As our relationship developed after about six more weeks, I felt we
were becoming closer. Then, Ayelet stopped coming to sessions. After
three weeks, I contacted her and she came into the clinic. It emerged
that Ayelet had disappeared because of her obsessive thoughts. She
was living under the impression that she had the magic power of
harming and hurting people she cared about. She gave me as proof
what she had done to her own family, her grandmother, and her
previous therapist who had recently died. I realized that she was
terrified of harming me too, because I had now become someone
important to her.


With this understanding, I tried to persuade Ayelet that my magic
powers were stronger than hers. I explained that while she was
helpless and surrendered to her thoughts and could not control them,
I, on the other hand, had the power of controlling my thoughts and
having them obey me. She replied that she was crazy, and that she had
been told this in the hospital. She cited as evidence her tendency to

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I taught her about the way all of us talk to ourselves all the time.
This self-talk directly arouses emotions and behaviors. When
someone says ‘I can't help it, I'm afraid. This will never work’, then
stress and anxious feelings will arise. However, we can learn to use
self-talk in a positive way, to improve our coping, and to change our
automatic negative self-talk. For example, one can tell oneself instead:
‘I know this is difficult, but I hope that if I try I might be able to do it.
Maybe I'll be a little afraid, but, if I don't run away, the fear will
lessen.’ Such self-talk might help stop unwanted thoughts and start a
better, more helpful way of thinking. We practiced the method of
changing automatic thoughts to mediated ones, and Ayelet had to
practice at home as well, looking for at least one example of a thought
she could try to change each day. She thought it was artificial. Still, I
asked her to try do so, and gradually it became more natural for her.


I believe that one of the most important steps toward change
relates to the therapeutic relationship. As a cognitive-constructivist
therapist, I do not consider the therapeutic relationship to be the most
important feature in the change process. Nevertheless, I am
convinced, as Safran and Segal (1990) stated, that interpersonal relationships
formulate the crucial basis upon which we design and
conduct the treatment. Trust, empathy, and beliefs constitute the
foundation for facilitating motivation, increasing compliance, and
enabling a good collaboration between client and therapist (Kanfer
and Schefft 1988; Mahoney 1991; Rosenbaum and Ronen 1998). At
this stage in Ayelet's treatment, I could assert that we were successfully
developing a good therapeutic relationship and were engaging
our mutual strengths in the change process.

<font size="4"><b>9: The First Problem Area: Treating Her Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</b></font>
[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As mentioned above, we started individual therapy in the ninth week
of intervention (after one intake session, two baseline weeks, and five
weeks of family therapy). The initial problem selected for treatment
was Ayelet's OCD. Until we started treating it, no change had
occurred in the pattern of the OCD. Shafran (1998) reported that
OCD among children and adolescents relates mainly to the fear of
death and danger to the close family. Likewise, Ayelet's anxious
thoughts generally involved a fear of her beloved ones’ dying. Her
compulsions were mainly characterized by counting. Ayelet would
count in groups of three, back and forth, in order to change the
meaning of her bad or obsessive thoughts. The number of times she
had to count depended on how strong the obsession was and to
whom it was related. Also, she avoided looking at newspaper obituaries
or at the traditional death announcements posted near houses in
mourning, because she tended to ‘see’ the names of the people she
loved inside the black frames.


As suggested by Salkovskis (1996) and Rachman (1997),
treatment of OCD is usually based on behavioral components, with
no emphasis on cognitive components. I decided to treat her OCD
using Marks' (1969, 1978, 1987) method of exposure. The
treatment included three stages. The first target was to avoid talking
about her obsessive thoughts of harming her family or that they

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second stage consisted of making an audio tape of Ayelet's
thoughts. Marks explained that, while talking to others, an obsessive
person believes his or her thoughts seem to be very logical. However,
listening to a tape creates the effect of someone else talking, and soon
the thoughts become boring and annoying. When the client feels
bored and tired of the thoughts, he or she is ready to stop the
automatic thinking and begin more palatable mediated thinking.
This procedure proved very difficult for Ayelet; she felt stupid both
making the cassette and listening to it at home. At first she complained
that the recording showed exactly what she felt. These were
her true thoughts; therefore, it would not be a helpful method for her.
Then, she called me and said she could not stand listening to it any
longer, and she hated me for making her do it. I only released her
from listening to this first tape after she initiated and recorded a new
one:‘I prepared a better cassette -- one where I tell nicer things about
myself


The third stage comprised two components: avoiding the compulsive
behaviors while intentionally arousing the obsessive thoughts.
As a first step, she was forbidden to count. Cleverly, she initially
managed this by simply avoiding meeting people she cared about.
She stayed in her room, avoided her parents, wouldn't come to our
sessions, etc. When I realized her strategy, I spoke to her by phone
and asked her to purposely meet everyone she was afraid of harming
as often as she could each day -- but to avoid the counting. I brought
to our next session as many obituaries as I could find, forcing her to

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ayelet used to say she thought she was crazy because she heard
voices telling her to count. I reframed this into: ‘You're afraid of
hurting people, so you think of ways to prevent the possibility of
harm.’ She liked the reframing of ‘hearing strange voices’ to her
‘internal thoughts that each of us have’, and she talked a great deal
about how she used to fear being schizophrenic. I asked Ayelet to
chart the urge to count daily and to rate how difficult it was for her to
avoid it.


As in so many other arenas of her life, when Ayelet decided to
overcome her OCD, she always did more than I asked, trying to be
perfect. In the past, she had been such a ‘perfect’ anorexic that no one
could treat her or help her change her eating habits. Now, she was
taking on more assignments than necessary; for example, when asked
as homework to look at mourning announcements three times a day,
she would look at them five times.


Ayelet's compulsive counting behavior had disappeared very
quickly (within one month), but she was still complaining of
obsessive thoughts. She asked for techniques to avoid thinking or else
to change her thoughts, but I judged it would be better for her to try
to concentrate on those thoughts, to face them until they stopped
causing anxiety reactions. I taught her methods to sit down and concentrate
on thinking about death and harm. Slowly, gradually, over
the next three weeks, these thoughts decreased significantly. About
three weeks later, as she practiced ways to overcome her anxiety, she
reported that she did not see herself as having OCD any longer.

<font size="4"><b>10: Treating Her Anxieties and Fears</b></font>
[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Together with her OCD, Ayelet exhibited a range of anxiety
reactions, mainly related to meeting other people. Part of her anxiety
could be explained by the long, three-year period of hospitalization
and by her withdrawal from social activity for the three years prior to
that, at home. She had, in fact, not been involved in normal social
activity at all during her adolescent years and exhibited a social skills
deficit. Most of the youngsters in the hospital had been younger than
Ayelet, came from a different social class, and were not as intelligent.
Even at her worst time, when she was on high doses of medication,
Ayelet was the best student in the hospital school. The staff complained
that she was not friendly and would not take part in social activities;
however, I believe that they could not understand how
different Ayelet was from the other adolescents there. She did not
speak their language, she did not enjoy their jokes and stories, and
she was occupied by different kinds of thoughts.


Although the OCD had decreased, no change was apparent in the
other anxiety disorders. Ayelet was afraid of walking in the street
because she feared people would see she was different. She would not
take public transportation or start talking with anyone in the street
(even people she knew). She always thought people were looking at
her and laughing at her. I personally thought Ayelet looked
wonderful -- tall, pretty, with long hair, very bright and talented. At
first, I used to remark ‘How wonderful you look’ when she arrived for
sessions, but, realizing that this was not a compliment for her, I
stopped commenting on her appearance.


At 12 weeks of intervention, we started working on eliminating
her fear and anxiety. Although anxieties and fears are commonly

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The behavioral exposure treatment included (Marks 1987):
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. rational explanations concerning the need for her to be
exposed to the threatening stimuli and to stop her avoidant
behavior (i.e. leaving the house, going out, meeting people,
riding public transportation)

<tr><td>
<p>
2. pinpointing her exposure targets

To this end, I asked her to start taking walks outside, and I
asked her parents to drop her off several blocks from my clinic
and have her walk to me alone.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Ayelet was also given daily exposure tasks such as taking her dog for a
walk in ever-increasing distances from her home (first five minutes,
then ten, and so on) and in increasingly public, crowded, and noisy directions
(from small neighborhood streets to larger roads and then
busy thoroughfares). Eventually, she was asked to gradually get used
to the bus, until she was able to take it all the way from home to the

The cognitive component included understanding the link
between her fearful thoughts and her increase in anxiety, and trying
to change the thoughts and to use self-coping methods, cognitive restructuring,
and self-control exercises aims at helping her confront
her difficulties and overcoming them (Ronen 1996).


One anxiety-provoking reaction that was difficult to treat was her
dreams. Ayelet would sleep fully clothed, fearing that she would be
taken to the hospital in the middle of the night. Only after a year in
individual therapy, when she was able to follow my recommendation
that she return to the hospital and meet with her therapist there, did
she overcome her nighttime anxiety. After proving to them that she
was alive and healthy, Ayelet no longer had that nightmare, and she
started sleeping in pajamas. However, these incidents occurred much
later, when she already had a boyfriend who took her to all four
hospitals where she had been, in an effort to help her recover from
that trauma.


Treatment of anxiety lasted six weeks, in sessions held twice
weekly. This stage of treatment was terminated when Ayelet started
taking driving lessons (in the 18th week of treatment). After three
months of lessons, she received her driver's license.


We were ready to start working on problems relating to vocational
and social skills and the environment.

It had seemed as if Ayelet needed to overcome her OCD and anxiety
reactions as a preliminary step toward starting to learn a profession.
When these goals were accomplished, I began to hope she would be
able to start planning her life and filling it with contents that would
satisfy her.


At the 19th week of therapy, Ayelet no longer suffered from the
OCD or her fear of going out, but she still had the hospital-related
nightmare. At this time, we started working on her vocational future,
which she had not addressed in any way. Ayelet was afraid that people
would discover she was ‘too stupid’ and incapable of learning. She
refused to try to do something ‘smart’. Also, she feared communicating
with people. Vocational problems may be the outcome of skill
deficits and of anxiety (Hops and Greenwood 1988). Ayelet's
treatment, therefore, focused on both these components. We started
looking at newspapers for classified advertisements about work or
study. She was instructed to make supported, guided telephone calls
to find out details, and to go to her high school to ask for transcripts
of her grades. I asked Ayelet to go interview for jobs in which she had
no interest-just to practice how to talk and present herself. Then, she
agreed to register for a ten-month course as a medical secretary. She
was over-qualified for the course, but it provided good practice in
riding public transportation, being with people, and taking tests. As I
expected, she was the best student in her class and completed the
course with honors. However, she still did not believe in herself and
found it very difficult when she had to start working as a medical
secretary. She feared criticism, failure, and not doing her job perfectly.

Next, Ayelet enrolled in a one-year reflexology course. She would
not let anyone else touch her to practice the exercises on her, but
always volunteered to practice on others. She enjoyed the course and
she finished first in her class.


Following these two courses (two years after starting therapy),
Ayelet enrolled in special education studies in college, which was the
field she had secretly dreamed of pursuing. The first year of her
studies was very difficult; she often threatened to leave and feared
failing. Being very honest, frank, and naive, Ayelet, in a dynamic
group session for students, talked about her past. The faculty were
alarmed, and her adviser recommended that she leave school. Upon
Ayelet's request, I contacted the adviser to inquire why, and she tried
to persuade me that it would be too dangerous for Ayelet to continue
studying: ‘She might break down and be hospitalized again.’ I felt her
instructors were terrified of her. It came to a point where I had to sign
a contract where I took all responsibility for her condition and
offered to be involved in every aspect of her studies. I urged her instructors
to treat her the same way they treated all the other students
and not to hesitate in giving her feedback and criticism. During that
year, I worked with Ayelet very closely on issues that arose relating to
her studies, and I frequently conversed with her academic supervisor.
As previously, Ayelet was continually the best student in her special
education studies. At the time of this writing, she is working as a
teacher, after receiving her bachelor's degree and her teaching permit
in special education with high honors. Still, things are not easy for
her. She was offered a job, began working as a teacher in a special
education school, and received very good feedback from parents and
students. However, soon after, the school heard about her past, and
they fired her with no justification. Ayelet came to consult with me as
to whether or not she should complain and sue them, but together we
decided it would not be in her best interests psychologically to
become involved then in legal battles in the courts. I was sure she
could find another job where she would be much more appreciated.
Soon enough, Ayelet did find employment, and now she teaches in a

Social relationships are a very central component in the ability of
youngsters to adjust and adapt to a healthy life style. A lack of social
skills and social competencies is considered to be a main reason for
the development and maintenance of childhood disorders (Hops and
Greenwood 1988). During the last decade, there has been an increase
of interest in peer relationships among therapists. Also, there is a
growing awareness among therapists and researchers of social relationships'
influence on healthy adjustment. These recent trends have
resulted in concentrated efforts to develop social skills training
programs to help children overcome difficulties (Hops and
Greenwood 1988).


Ayelet's social competence had improved even prior to direct intervention,
during our work toward fear reduction, exposure tasks,
and vocational integration. We started working directly on her social
skills (Hops and Greenwood 1988; Thyer 1991) in the 24th week of
treatment. At that time, Ayelet began studying in the medical
secretary course and meeting people through her classes. With my
support, Ayelet started improving her social relationships by making
phone calls to schoolmates. She continued by going out to the city
center and saying hello to old friends she happened to meet on the
street. Gradually, she even dared inviting an old friend to come visit
her.


In one of her visits to a local shopping center, she met a male friend
who lived not far from her, and they started dating. Ayelet was very
shy at first, and hesitated whether she should meet him. Several
things helped her continue meeting him at that first stage. First, this
coincided with the time we worked on social skills, and dating him

<font size="4"><b>13: Starting the Journey Toward Self-Acceptance</b></font>
[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Forty-two weeks after the beginning of intervention, we started
working toward self-acceptance. Ayelet suffered from insecurity, a
lack of self-confidence, and overly critical self-evaluation. However,
her tremendous motivation had caused her to begin the process of
changing these even before we targeted them directly. As a consequence
of her success in overcoming her various anxiety and social
disorders, she had slowly been able to feel confident enough to go out
and meet friends. She had started showing her grades off with pride.
She had even started to put on some make-up for the first time. Still,
she found it hard to accept, love, and live with herself. So we started
working on her perceptions of the self and the world.


Ayelet's daily language was full of metaphors. She used to say that
she was full of garbage and that there was an urgent need to clean this
up in order for her to be able to live a normal life. These
client-generated metaphors, to use Kopp's (1995) term, introduced
by Ayelet routinely as a part of her regular life, served as mirrors reflecting
her inner images of self, life, and others. Like Alice in Wonderland,
as Kopp proposed, Ayelet could go through the looking
glass and journey beyond the mirror's image, entering the domain of
creative imagination. Mahoney (1991, 1995) suggested that images
could become a key to unlocking new possibilities for self-created
change. Slowly, each week, using metaphor sessions, I was able to
enter Ayelet's world. I helped her enter the metaphor of cleaning up
the garbage, and while imagining herself as a cleaning lady, we
looked at all the things we were able to throw away, such as her OCD,

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt that the chances of future success would be greater if we took
the time to evaluate and assess Ayelet's success over the past year. I felt
that helping her to evaluate and appreciate what she had already
achieved would increase her motivation and ability to work toward
those things she had not yet been able to overcome. In that year,
Ayelet's behavior and functioning had changed and improved significantly.
She had established friendships and good relationships with
her family and had experienced success in school. During that time,
she also had ceased vomiting or using laxatives to induce diarrhea.
Although she was thin, her weight had remained stable.


After taking time out (several sessions) to review her successes, we
started once again to work on those things she was not yet effectively
changing. For example, Ayelet continued to find it difficult to eat
normally. She would not sit down to the table, and would eat only
when no one saw, and only in little bites. She still suffered regularly
from stomach aches and used medication to empty herself.


Most of Ayelet's previous therapists had tried to help her change
her self-image. Her cognitive therapists had emphasized changing
Ayelet's automatic thought of ‘How fat I am’ into a mediated thought
of ‘I'm thinner than I need to be’. Her dynamically oriented therapists
had translated her eating disorders or body image into symbols of the
relationship with her parents. All of these trends had increased her
rejection and resistance to change. Ayelet had continued wishing to
be thinner than she was, and she still avoided eating unless she felt she
was absolutely starving or was being forced to eat by others.


Ayelet's attitude toward herself had not sufficiently changed
during the first year of therapy. I felt the need to try something
different from what she and her previous therapists had been doing.
At first we tried to pinpoint how Ayelet perceived herself by making
an ‘evaluation circle’, an evaluation method used by Wozner (1985). I
told her: ‘Each of us has many circles of people we know. In each
circle, people know us in a different way. The closer they are to us, the

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We continued with our evaluation circle; I asked her, ‘Now,
imagine you're being watched by people from your neighborhood.
They're not your friends, but they know who you are. What would
they say?’ Ayelet answered, ‘They might add that I'm polite, I greet
them nicely. Maybe a bit strange because I always have my head
down. But I've changed a lot lately since the time when I lost all that
weight and I was hospitalized.’


The next circle consisted of distant or extended family members
such as cousins, aunts, and uncles: ‘What would they say?’ Ayelet
smiled and replied, ‘Well, they're prejudiced. They think I'm a clever,
pretty, wonderful girl who just needs to get rid of some craziness that
came over my mind.’ I asked her to think what contribution her
friends would make to this evaluation, and she answered, ‘Too
sensitive, very emotional, nice to everyone but herself.’


I then asked Ayelet what she thought of herself, what she would
add. She smiled and said very softly, ‘I know everyone thinks I am
good looking, maybe even beautiful. I already told you that I believe
them, maybe they see me correctly and I am beautiful. But I don't feel
pretty. I can't help myself from feeling that I'm too fat, and too ugly. I
know that's not right, but I still think like that.’ Ayelet was also now
able to say, ‘I know people think I'm smart and pretty, but I feel
insecure. I know they're probably right and I'm wrong, but I don't

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We used acceptance methods (Mahoney 1995; Rosenbaum 1999)
in order for her to learn to accept and live with herself (Ronen
1997b). As I mentioned before, this tendency of feeling better with
herself started even before we treated it. However, in therapy we
focused on facilitating a better acceptance of herself, and on
changing her passive acceptance into an active ability to love and appreciate
herself.


Ayelet repeatedly stated that she had ‘some bad things’ deep inside
her and that she would never recover if we did not deal with them.
She often talked about ‘the big black hole of nothing’, ‘falling down
into the nothing’, and ‘a big emptiness inside’. At this stage in the
treatment, I asked her to lead me into her big hole. I wanted to learn,
together with her, how this 'hole of nothingness and emptiness'
looked. I assured her that I could throw her a rope ladder into the hole
and help her climb out. This trip was not easy. It involved tears,
sobbing, and sorrow. Ayelet thought the ‘real issue’ to be treated
related to her dark hole. I thought that the real issue was the way she
did not like herself, and could not accept the way she looked or
behaved. I believed that by finding significance to her life, and filling
the big hole with self-evaluation and self-love, she would stop feeling
empty. I suggested that Ayelet replace the metaphors of emptiness and
hole of nothing with the metaphor of gaps. She accepted this idea,
demonstrating progress. We defined our next target as helping her
accept herself similarly to the way in which others related to her.


In trying to pinpoint what about herself she had difficulty
accepting, we realized the issues were related to her appearance, her
thoughts, and her emotions. I worked with her toward acceptance of
her thoughts and emotions as her one and only irreversible truth, but
one with which she had to learn how to live. For example, when she

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This response on my part was very unfamiliar to her. However, this
approach constitutes what I believe it means to accept the other's
person meaning making and to work toward a true understanding of
the client's beliefs. Throughout all of her previous treatment experiences,
she had been guided toward changing how she viewed herself,
and suddenly I did not argue with her, nor did I try to show her the
distortions in her thoughts. I accepted what she said, and she did not
know how to react. She was silent for a long time, and then she said,
‘Well, I always thought that I had to fight in order to be perfect, and
that I don't deserve to live if I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect,
but what you say is that I can still live! I never thought of it like that.’
As a next step in enhancing Ayelet's self-acceptance, I introduced my
adaptation of the continuum method used by Christine Padesky and
Kathleen Mooney, in their Center for Cognitive Therapy in California.
The aim of working on such a continuum is twofold. First, it helps
clients attain a more realistic perception of their problems. Second, it
improves clients' self-evaluation by teaching them how to rate themselves
in relation to: others (e.g. peers); a different time in life (e.g. last
month); wishes (e.g. the ideal situation or desired behavior); or a
different component in functioning (e.g. extent of tics in English
versus math class versus recess) (Ronen 1997b). These comparative
ratings help the client move from a basic holistic view of ‘all or
nothing’ (which causes one's self-perception as ‘a nothing, a failure’)
to be changed into a view of oneself as lying somewhere in a good
position along a continuum of other people or situations.


For Ayelet, I prepared several continua. First, I asked her to rate
each of her friends and her family members in relation to ‘how good

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Next, I asked Ayelet to put herself on the continuum in relation to
others, and at first she refused. After a while, she put herself on 7 and
laughed. ‘Well, maybe I'm even an 8. I don't know’ Ayelet had
already stopped looking at herself as an ugly fat girl, but she found it
hard to admit that she had better thoughts of herself. I asked her to
rate herself on that continuum in relation to her appearance three
years ago, in relation to her desired appearance, and in relation to the
way she believed she really could look in the future. When we summarized
these scales, Ayelet admitted that she was in a ‘good position
in the middle or maybe a little higher’. As a homework assignment,
she was asked to rate her appearance every day as she felt and thought
of herself in relation to: (a) the day before, (b) her friends, and (c) her
family.


She practiced this method for more than a month, bringing me
each continuum at the start of our weekly sessions. We examined and
re-examined the questions: ‘How do you feel about yourself today in
relation to how you used to think and feel about yourself? What
other changes would you like to achieve in your feeling? How do you
think you can contribute to this change?’


The change in Ayelet's self-evaluation was evident from the
changes that evolved in her appearance. When I first met her, she
would wear long oversized black sweaters and would tie her hair back
very carefully. She continued wearing black; however, her clothes
became tighter fitting and shorter, and she began to use colorful accessories
such as red ribbons or multicolored vests. She started letting
her hair down loose and became more and more beautiful. (A year

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the two-year mark of therapy, Ayelet continued to refuse to look
at herself in the mirror or to perform any exercise I suggested relating
to a mirror. However, I thought she must get acquainted with her real
body. I decided to use Mahoney's (1991) method of mirror working.
She agreed to use a very small hand mirror. We began with her
looking only at the toes on her left foot. She laughed while doing
this, hesitating a little, but, as usual, she tried to do her best. In that
session she became able to move the mirror and look over her whole
leg. Over the next four weeks, she was asked as homework to look at
one additional body part each day and then to demonstrate this to me
during the sessions. As she progressed and she was able to look at her
body, she could admit she was not that bad looking. However, she
was too frightened when it came time for her to look at her face in the
mirror. Exploiting her creativity, in the next session I made her
prepare masks, color them, and look at herself through the masks. It
was a very fun session because she made masks of witches and
laughed when she looked at herself. She kept changing masks, from
that of a man to that of a woman. Finally she said, ‘Well, I wouldn't
like to be a man. I want to be a woman. Do you think I will ever be
able to have a normal life, have sex and children?’


It was the first time Ayelet had mentioned sex, which had been a
taboo subject before. She then began talking about her fears that she
would be unable to have children because of her previous medical
problems. I realized she could now conceive of herself as a sexual
woman, and she was beginning to accept her urges and needs. She
was already dating her boyfriend, so being concerned about her
sexuality was not any longer generalized anxiety but a specific fear
whether or not she could build normal healthy relationships with
him. At first, she was very much ashamed of her past history She
expected her boyfriend's family to reject her and get against their
relationship. He urged her not to share her past history with people
(especially his family) before they learned to know her closely. He

The experience with her boyfriend and his family was very
important for Ayelet. She learned that she could control her life
without being haunted by her past. But this is not something that
came immediately or naturally. We had to work and deal with it. Only
after a long time as a couple did Ayelet learn that love and trust can be
a wonderful change agent, and that she had nothing to be ashamed of
or needs to conceal.

<font size="4"><b>14: Incorporating Ayelet's Creativity, Imagination and Talent</b></font>
[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ayelet demonstrated a great creative urge: She wrote poetry and
stories, kept lists, painted, and shared her daydreams and nighttime
dreams. Around this time, as we worked on her self-acceptance, I
decided to tap her creative imagination as a technique for change
(Ronen, in press). Lazarus (1984) compared the brain to an extremely
intricate and dynamic computer that stores voices, pictures, and
images. Each event is transferred into images and thoughts that
influence our actions. The brain collects many creative solutions if we
are inventive and allow images to arise. Ayelet showed an aptitude for
using her creative skills, implying that she had the courage to take
risks. I could challenge her during every session to imagine herself
coping, progressing, and entering a new world of excitement and experiences
(Ronen, in press).


In view of Ayelet's difficulties talking about sensitive issues and
the fact that she drew and painted regularly, I asked her to let me into
her world through her art. After several sessions of artwork, she
arrived one day with a big portfolio of all her pictures from the period
of her hospitalizations (see Part I of the book). She put the portfolio
down in front of me, saying, ‘This is my world of emptiness and
nothing. Take it. I don't want it anymore.’ All of the drawings were on
old parchment-like paper, in black ink. All of them showed human
figures, but there were no signs of sexuality. The figures looked like
trees, and most seemed -- from their long hair -- to be of women,
always in a gesture of prayer, crying or asking for help.

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During that part of treatment, we used many metaphors. Ayelet
used to talk about the black hole she was in and about the emptiness
she was sensing. I used to ask her to imagine she was in that hole. I
wanted her to try describing what it was like to be there. Then,
gradually, I asked her to try bringing me inside that hole. Together,
we would find ways out of there, find ways to brighten the hole, and
discover things with which to fill the emptiness.


I used positive creative imagination to help create a good picture of
the future (Ronen, in press). At first, this future had to be ‘in 500
years’ time’ because Ayelet did not believe it was possible. Later, as she
became able to imagine some of the good things that could happen
500 years on, we could start making them come true earlier.


I believe that trying to speak in her language -- of metaphors,
imagery, poetry, drawing, and art -- was the main tool that helped me
bridge the gap between Ayelet and myself, and between her sickness
and health.

When Ayelet started dating and fell in love, she shared her relationship
with her boyfriend with me. As the relationship became serious,
she insisted on me seeing her together with her boyfriend. First, she
wanted him to know exactly who she was, with no secrets or
surprises. Second, she wanted him to know all the possible risks to
their future together. Third, she wanted my help in learning to live
together, starting to have sex, and overcoming some of her inhibitions
and intimacy difficulties. Finally, Ayelet emphasized the fact
that since they were serious about each other, she and her boyfriend
needed to receive guidance.


Ayelet's boyfriend was the best thing that could ever have
happened to her. He adored her yet never gave up his wish for her to
change. He asked my advice on ways to help her. He made her change
the way she dressed, daring her to put on more attractive clothes. He
made her join him in social activities and dance together. He did not
fear her rejection of sex and consulted me about how to overcome it.


It is important for me to add that the relationship between Ayelet
and her boyfriend did not develop as a fairy tale. It was not as if they
felt in love and everything was immediately perfect. However, there
was enough basic love and trust to ensure that they would be able to
solve these conflicts, and find a way to live together. For example,
trying to overcome their sex problems, they worked together on assignments
such as standing naked in front of the mirror, looking at
themselves while hugging and kissing. He could help her where I
could not, and with lots of love and care, he helped her to have sex
and enjoy it.

At the time of this writing they are married and living happily
together. They are a very loving couple. He works in the military, and
she teaches her special education class. Together, they are raising their
two young children. After they married, they used to come to me once
in a while, mainly for consultation. She is very dependent on him, and
eats almost normally in his presence. I still do not trust her eating
habits when she is alone. As of now, she eats well for her husband's
sake, but I also think that her eating and health habits have changed
during pregnancy and will improve still further as a natural result of
her desire to be a good mother.


I believe that motherhood is very good for Ayelet. She is a good
mother and wife. The pregnancy has made her more calm, relaxed,
and accepting. She found it to be a corrective experience, assuaging
her concerns about her own femininity and fertility. As far as her
maternal capabilities, Ayelet's experiences have taught her to be very
sensitive and considerate of others and have given her tools to cope
and overcome serious hurdles. Both these aspects should serve her
well as a new mother.

Ayelet was in therapy for four years. Over the years of treatment,
Ayelet evidenced remarkable changes in all areas of her life. In
keeping with the multiple-treatment design, each of her problem
areas other than eating disorders and self-acceptance (family, OCD,
anxiety and fears, vocational, social skills) did not improve until we
started treating it. Then, each improved greatly soon after we started
working toward change. Post-treatment self-evaluation revealed significant
improvement in comparison to baseline assessment.


Working on familial change improved the quality of relationships
between Ayelet and each of her parents, with an increased ability for
emotional expression and physical touch. This first area of change
was a lasting one that continued improving over the years of
treatment. Ayelet was very motivated for change and did her best to
comply with therapy, as manifested in the change she evidenced in
her OCD, anxieties, and fears. Major progress was also evident in
Ayelet's vocational involvement. At first, she was not able to discuss it,
make phone calls, or look at the classifieds. Yet, within weeks, she was
able to enroll in a course of study. She graduated the four-year
bachelor program in special education (with honors), obtained her
teaching license, and began working as a teacher in a special
education class, which she continues to do to this day.


Ayelet started acquiring social skills while we worked toward fear
reduction and exposure tasks, but she felt more secure and ready to
communicate with friends later on, as we practiced social skills. An
impressive area of change was Ayelet's self-acceptance and self-evaluation,
which underwent changes even prior to direct treatment. As we
started working on these directly she became able to compliment

As I mentioned above, we never worked directly on Ayelet's eating
habits, but these demonstrated improvement while her other
problems were in focus. Gradually, as she felt better adjusted in her
family, less anxious, more successful vocationally and socially, and
more accepting of herself physically and emotionally, Ayelet stopped
using laxative medications, stopped vomiting, and started having
regular bowel movements. Today, six years later at age 27, she still
worries about gaining weight and carefully watches everything she
eats. She says that the anorexic thoughts are always on her mind, and
she doesn't believe she can get rid of them. However, now she is also
certain that she does not want to lose weight or endanger her life. She
eats because she has reasons to live a healthy life -- a husband,
children, work, and family.


I do not know how to end this story. There is no end. It is the story
of a struggle that continues every day. But each time there is more
hope, and more smiles. I believe that love, trust, and hope are really
the most important features in helping Ayelet live with herself and
progress.
