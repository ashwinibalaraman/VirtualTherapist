"And you think <i>Lear</i> had problems? You're like King <i>Fear</i>."


That's a nickname, spontaneously given to me ages ago by a substitute
shrink. I'd been referred to him by my regular shrink while
she was vacationing as far away as she could get from clients—somewhere
near the equator. When this idiotic, stand-in quack ad-libbed
that nonsense during <i>my</i> session, I bolted, slammed down a hundred-dollar
bill and screamed, "Sticks and stones will break my bones but
words will never hurt me." King Fear has left the building, the doctor
probably thought to himself as he happily contemplated telling his
shrink pals at a dinner party later that night the tale of how he
taunted me into better health.


In my gut I hoped this doctor was trying to make a joke to the
self-effacing <i>comedian</i> in his room. But, considering he knew that
I'd had a huge anxiety attack the day before, his comment felt
inappropriate. But to give credit where credit is due, I must
shamefully admit that, joking or not, he was right on the money.
More amazingly he only had to listen to me moan for about three

Only one day before the "Fear" session I was an immobilized
wreck who couldn't get out of bed for the better part of twenty-four
hours, except to take a dump. And when I did get out of bed to move
my bowels, I had forgotten that I had loaded up on stomach remedies
the night before so that my <i>stool</i> (pardon me) was a really strange
color, and true to form, with an anxiety attack drawing near, I
instantly concluded that I had contracted some terrible stool-coloring
disease and would die in a matter of moments. What a <i>shitty</i> way to
live. I was like a one-man, anxious talk-radio station... K-FEAR.
"ALL FEAR, ALL THE TIME."


I lived through my imagined fecal cancer-warning catastrophe
but still fell into one of my <i>depression stupors</i>. Do you know the kind?
For me, it begins immediately the moment I first open my eyes in
the morning and begin to list all the negative stuff waiting for me.
Without much effort I can even do it alphabetically. The list of
potential problems both real and imagined can render me frozen
with negative coming attractions. If I already have a rash and it
didn't go away overnight I immediately leap to skin cancer. If it does
go away I wonder whether it will come back or whether it migrated
to somewhere else on my body that I can't readily spot. I worry that
my girlfriend will hear lies spread about me or truths from angry ex-girlfriends
and hold it against me. I torture myself with not having
made funeral arrangements for myself, forcing a loved one to scamper
around and get a quickie funeral home for me. I can actually
visualize my body lying there with my soul hovering around aimlessly,
having left hours before with no place to go. These are just the
tip of the iceberg, and occur usually well before I have my first diet
Coke in the morning, and when I finish the diet Coke I immediately
realize that all the chemicals I just drank will contribute to yet
another early demise.


I start feeling like every fighter must have felt being pummeled in
the clinches by Marvelous Marvin Hagler. In my case, on mornings

After I quit drinking, for a long time I was shocked by the day-to-day
anguish of just getting through life without booze. Not drinking
was just the beginning of my dealing with my problem and wasn't
close to the cure. Even when the craving was over and some spirituality
materialized in me, I still had to be alone with myself; and
oftentimes that has been an almost impossible task. It's especially
nerve-racking when I have to keep myself company all day. I'm my
own worst neighbor. I hear myself say to myself, "Keep it down, asshole,"
to that negative voice, but I continue to ridicule myself.


Adding insult to insanity, I found it hard to truly understand how
practicing <i>acceptance</i> would help me evolve into a happier person.
This whole <i>acceptance</i> thing was just a word until it slowly became a
way of life for me after I sobered up. Simply, when alcoholism ruled,
nothing much mattered, including what others wanted or even who
they were because I wanted to drink more than anything else. When
the disease was in high gear, it exercised so much control over me
that my self-centeredness blossomed from perhaps a healthy narcissism
to a sloppy, self-absorbed monstrousness. I learned then that
one of the things I had to give up was my ego, which in turn made it
easier to surrender to my drinking, and then made it easier to accept
others for who they were rather than as obstacles to the satisfaction
of my own needs. When it worked I loved it; when it backfired, I lost
confidence in the whole <i>acceptance</i> idea. It has taken me a considerable
amount of time, <i>almost a lifetime</i>, to accept others without being
so self-involved as to think that their actions only really revolve
around the effect they have on me. I soon not only had a bigger picture
of life and the universe, but of all the people, particularly those
close to me: of how they were just other people who for better or for
worse had their own agenda and goals. So long as I didn't let the fact
that they had perspectives different from my own bother me, nor let
their journey interfere with my newfound serenity, I soon found
that my self-centered thinking was quieting, and acceptance of others,
which was a natural segue, just happened magically by itself.

And on that particular morning before my emergency session
with the interim headshrinker, like many another morning, I woke
up feeling so overwhelmed with anxiety, so unable to simply let life
take care of itself, I could only sweat it out. So I just lay motionless. I
stayed in bed, <i>worrying in place</i>.


Within an hour, I heard answering-machine messages from several
business associates who seemed to be forming a <i>vast, antihappiness
conspiracy</i> to make sure that I felt my life was totally crumbling
around me. My mind zipped into high gear and before I knew it my
depression and anxiety started to gather steam and project themselves
far into the darkened future, and I didn't think I had a chance
of turning any of it around. I felt much more comfortable just staying
in bed at my newly christened <i>Misery Motel</i>.


In passing, I will say, it wouldn't have been the worst thing if we
Jews had had someone in biblical times die for our anxieties. I
mean—and don't get me wrong—God is plenty, but a nice little Sol
or Myron savior would have been cool. He could've taken <i>the big
panic attack in the sky</i> for the rest of us, so we wouldn't have to start so
many mornings feeling like we have this boulder on our chests with
graffiti on it, spray-painted by a sociopath, listing all the people and
things that we think are standing between us and peace of mind.


I know now that I was the one standing in my way. I didn't know
it on <i>that</i> morning or countless others, but I do now. In the past, I felt
I had to address every single fear and resentment instantly, or risk
feeling like a phony. Now I take great pride in doing nothing a lot of
the time. I learned that when I do nothing, often the creeps go away
at their own pace to a safe distance from me.


It's a new way of living for me, to feel like life is not passing me
by just because I am standing still. I never used to live as I do now
because I thought that the bogeyman would catch me and declare
me an impostor. So I lived in a constant state of anxious alert, ready
to attack anyone who dared call me on my insecurities, or judged

It used to be that when anything in my life, even something
good, was making me miserably anxious, dawn seemed more like
the continuation of a jail sentence than the start of a promising new
day. I would open up one eye and peer around, hoping that my
other eye might see things with a better frame of mind. But it didn't
work that way. Instead, I would start concocting my own inedible
<i>complaint casserole</i> ("mm mm good") for my already taxed mind to
torture itself with, gourmet-style. Within moments I had so much ill
will toward so many people, places, and things, that there seemed
no point in getting up in a universe that contained them.


I felt like I must have continually cut the class that taught about
<i>tools</i> that could have helped me deal with my anger and frustration,
by simply taking an action, trusting it, and moving on. It was almost
as if having integrity wasn't enough. Something was missing. There
must have been such a big hole in my confidence that I continually
needed some sort of validation from anywhere, a burning bush, <i>anything</i>,
to make it feel like I knew what I was doing. Instead, I either
swallowed how I really felt or just let it simmer, sometimes for years
at a time, only to see it resurface light-years later, generally in
response to the wrong person—in response to something else altogether!


Now when I get overwhelmed with free-floating anxiety, I hardly
do anything at all. I try to stay still and listen to my heartbeat. I did
this very thing yesterday, when the morning started out in piss-poor
fashion and made me wonder what the point was to staying sober if
I was going to be so stressed and miserable. I had again lost sight of
the fact that life <i>can</i> be miserable, and that more often than not, people
like me <i>create our own misery</i>. As I lay in bed, listening to a new set
of wackos on my answering machine, I did not elect to go back to
sleep. I didn't lose my sobriety. I didn't even do anything that could
be labeled as foolish or unprincipled. I swear. I could only hear my

This time, I made a list of all the things and people pushing me to
feel so hopeless and helpless I could not leave my bed, and calmly figured
out what I could do about each, <i>if anything</i>. Some things I could
do made sense and others were insane. So one by one I made a decision,
took an action or decided not to take an action, and let it go. I let
it go. I let it go. I let it go. I let it go. I let it go. I have to repeat and
repeat that, because I have spent most of my life hanging on crazily to
resentments and other bad feelings; then ultimately I let go of my own
self-esteem. This time I called the villains one by one and told them
the truth and my anxiety seemed to melt away. The truth may not
always set you free but it sure as hell scares the shit out of liars and
scoundrels. Try it sometime. When some unscrupulous person is obviously
fucking with your head, just stand tall, tell them how you feel,
and watch what happens. Sometimes nothing happens and that's fine,
because it usually means only that the big "bad guys" might put up a
little stink (the <i>skunks)</i> before scurrying off in search of easier prey.


That's what I did the other day. Quite a step for <i>this</i> lunatic! It was
so fucking easy I could hardly believe my own self-esteem. I just
went down a laundry list of assholes, told them how I honestly felt,
and they started to shrink, like obedient, trained hemorrhoids. My
problems shrunk too, and my hope started to grow again as they fled
like cowards!


Okay, maybe I never left the house but I didn't lose my mind
either. I know the outcome was right because it feels pure. I spoke

I had an <i>out-of-calamity experience!</i>


I had one full day and didn't do a goddamn thing. It was near
midnight when I got off the phone and finished doing "nothing." I
was really exhausted. Luckily I was still in my pajamas. So I just
closed my eyes and slept like a baby.


<i>King Fear</i> has left the building.


Unfortunately, he knows where I live.
