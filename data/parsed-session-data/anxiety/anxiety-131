<font size="4"><b>23: The Gap Between Research and Practice: Achieving 

Effective In-Service Training for Teachers Working with EBD Students</b></font>

<b>EGIDE ROYER</b>


Pre-service and in-service training of teachers and other school staff is not
a new topic and has long been an important preoccupation for schools as
well as for university Schools of Education. We nevertheless deem it
necessary to address the specific problems related to the poor quality of
today's teacher training with regard to the educational needs of emotionally
and behaviourally disordered (EBD) students. This issue is extremely
important, particularly in terms of the academic achievement and social
adaptation of EBD students and its relevance to the quality of intervention
research conducted in the school setting.


Over the last 15 years, I have taught many courses on this very subject
at the School of Education at Universit Laval, Qubec, and have also
given numerous in-service training seminars and presentations on school
intervention with EBD students in Belgium, England, France, Canada,
Thailand and Brazil. One conclusion from these activities is obvious:
when attending an in-service training session, our teachers are most often
receiving pre-service training they had not received while at university.
Most of the school staff attending these sessions or listening to the presentations
at other times are often learning something totally new. Clearly,
the basic training in how to teach behaviourally disordered students has
not been part of their initial training. This situation may be best summarized

[p. <i>374</i>]

Our field is seriously deficient in terms of pre-service and in-service
teacher training in educating EBD students. To say the least, the relationship
between research and practice is also difficult. The present chapter
therefore seeks to address the following questions:


 What is our knowledge base concerning the most effective practices
used in educating EBD students and how visible is it in the classroom?


 How significant is the gap between research and practice in this aspect
of education?


 How can we best describe excellence in pre- and in-service training in
teaching EBD students?


<b>A SAMPLE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE OF
THE BEST EDUCATION PRACTICES WITH
EBD STUDENTS AND ITS VISIBILITY
IN THE CLASSROOM</b>


Our current knowledge base on the education of EBD students reflects
many important developments of the last 25 years. To assess the quality
of pre- and in-service training in teaching EBD students, we may use a sample
of this knowledge as a reference or standard which will serve as a basis
for comparison and help us to determine what must be considered in the
professional development of our teachers. For each element, an observation
is made to evaluate the integration of this specific knowledge in the professional
practice of teachers who work each day with EBD students.


<b>Knowledge 1: When teaching an EBD student,
the school must address the child as a whole</b>


We know that in order to be effective, educators of EBD students must
consider an holistic school approach that uses a strong inter-agency component
based on collaboration. This requires expanding the intervention to
include each setting in which the child evolves (particularly home and
school), within the notion that education is necessary, yet not sufficient in
effectively helping these children. The mission and structure of the school
therefore provides the ideal setting for the integration of health care and
education into comprehensive, community-based, wrap-around services
for these students.

[p. <i>375</i>]

<b><i>Observation</i></b>


There remains a very strong tendency to target the EBD student or his
family as being the problem. The school is not perceived as a base for the
integration of the many inter-agency services required by the child and his
family (Cheney and Barringer, 1995). Too often we see multiple agencies
offering services to EBD children, their family and their school, with no
effective dialogue. The school philosophy is thus often limited to one of
cure the child and his family, then we will be able to teach him.


<b>Knowledge 2: Many EBD students break
rules to enhance their reputation</b>


Lacking academic success, some students seek to compensate by adopting a
non-conforming behaviour. To achieve this, they use the school's behaviour
management strategies to ensure that their non-conforming activities are all
very public and visibly displayed. They also see to it that how teachers
respond is also highly visible to peers. Punishment and admiration from peers
is then equated with success. Therefore, a school's intervention strategies
actually may assist some children in achieving the goal of establishing a nonconformist
reputation.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


What we are seeing is the overly-visible response to individual inadequate
behaviours. The management methods currently used by teachers actually
reinforce this non-conformist reputation (Houghton and Carroll, 1996).
Teachers and other school staff do not realize that their interventions are,
in fact, helping to sustain the behaviour problems of some EBD students.


<b>Knowledge 3: Academic achievement is an
important intervention goal with EBD students</b>


We know that it is imperative that these students develop academic skills that
will enable them to do well academically, as a definite connection exists
between school achievement and behaviour disorders (Ruhl and Berlinghoff,
1992). Academic and behavioural interventions must therefore be synchronized.
Attempting to encourage a child's self-esteem in school while he is
failing academically is increasingly considered to be a doomed effort.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


Many teachers, principals and professionals continue to believe that we
must fix the behaviour of students before being able to teach them. Many
still view the two processes  academic achievement and social behaviour
in school  as two independent realities (Levy and Vaughn, 2002).

[p. <i>376</i>]

<b>Knowledge 4: When teaching EBD students, some
interventions are more effective than others</b>


Using punishment as the sole method of intervention to make education
happen simply does not work. It ignites the cycle of coercion and increases the
probability of problem behaviours. The first line of intervention in schools
should not be repression, but an overall improvement of the environment and
disciplinary practices. Skiba and Peterson (2000), among others, recommend
conflict resolution/social instruction, classroom strategies for disruptive
behaviours, parent involvement, school-wide discipline and behavioural
planning, functional assessment and individual education plans. For teachers,
the following elements are critical when educating students with EBD:


 structure and routine;


 positive teacher-student interaction with sufficient encouragement and
systematic response to inappropriate behaviour; and


 organized teaching that solicits a high level of academic commitment
and student response.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


These interventions are not often observed, even in the specialized EBD
classroom (Wehby et al., 1998). Preferred interventions most often remain
based on a philosophy of control and the use of punishment to suppress
problem behaviour (Royer, 1995).


<b>Knowledge 5: Students affect their teacher's behaviour</b>


We know that child behaviour influences the way in which adults interact
with them (Patterson, 1982). For example, teachers' efforts to work with
EBD students are often received negatively and contribute to teacher
antipathy: the teacher gives a lesson, the student responds aggressively,
and the teacher reacts by teaching him less often. This avoidance behaviour
by the teacher results in an unpleasant classroom environment, which
explains why they teach less and less to EBD students.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


Most teachers do not recognize the significant impact caused by the student's
behaviour. Despite the fact that this transactional aspect of dealing
with EBD students is extremely important in developing effective classroom
intervention, it is not part of the usual assessment of EBD students
made by teachers, principals and other school employees (Wehby et al.,
1998).

[p. <i>377</i>]

<b>Knowledge 6: Setting limits and having
positive expectations are essential when
teaching EBD students</b>


We have long known some basic truths about successful teaching practices
with EBD students. As stated by Visser (2002), the field of educating EBD
students has pointed out some eternal truths or core factors which must
be present in any intervention with children with EBD needs, such as maintaining
consistent and coherent communication, setting boundaries and
providing challenges, which appear to have been effective with EBD
students for as long as one can remember.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


There is often the incoherent application of rules and a lack of consensus
in the expectations educators have with regard to the behaviour and
achievement of EBD students. Few seem to realize that a predictable
school environment and consistent adult supervision not only contribute
to diffuse anxiety, but also to help these students develop self-control and
a greater understanding of their emotions and behaviour.


<b>Knowledge 7: Assessment is a direct
component of intervention</b>


We know that diagnostic categories, be they educational or psychiatric in
nature, are poor predictors of intervention responsiveness (Strain, 2001;
Tremblay and Royer, 1992). Recent developments in functional analysis
support the importance of tailored interventions for EBD students. The
ability to determine the functions of behaviour and to teach replacement
behaviour are essential elements of a successful intervention.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


Teachers and principals continue looking for the one size fits all solution,
which will somehow solve the complex and long-lasting problems of
EBD children, regardless of the nature and function of their behaviour
(Royer, 2001).


<b>Knowledge 8: The practitioner must have a
plan, a representation, and a reference to
be able to work with EBD students</b>


We know that to be effective, teachers require a model to explain, to predict,
and to provide a better understanding of what is happening in their

[p. <i>378</i>]

<b><i>Observation</i></b>


We note a definite lack of paradigms or intervention models in the practice
of most teachers, school directors and even professionals, when
educating EBD students. What is observed is often completely improvisational,
based more on personal beliefs than on research-based models
(Vaughn et al., 1998).


<b>Knowledge 9: A staff value system
is a crucial element in successfully
educating EBD students</b>


As stated by Cole et al.,  Good practice in relation to EBD pupils will not
happen without the existence of strong and appropriate staff value systems
which shape the ethos of a school (1999: 13). Good schools thus appear
to be a great place to learn. Their philosophy is to support the positive
development of their students and staff. They promote positive and high-quality,
differentiated teaching by enhancing staff skills and problem-solving
abilities. Their behaviour policy is to help students not only learn,
but also to maintain positive social behaviours.


<b><i>Observation</i></b>


Many schools continue to reinforce a curriculum of control (Osher et al.,
1994), where everything is fine when behaviour problems are suppressed,
not visible.


<b>Knowledge 10: Individualized intervention
is necessary to make education happen
for EBD students</b>


Following a careful functional analysis, a multi-modal, multi-environmental
intervention must be planned and tailored to the needs of the EBD
student. Each case must be considered on an individual basis and with a
carefully designed intervention. This consumes both time and energy, but

[p. <i>379</i>]

<b><i>Observation</i></b>


One of the favoured methods in education continues to be the grouping
together of students with the same problem in the same class with some
kind of omnibus intervention or treatment. As we all know, a special
class does not an individualized intervention make. For instance, I have
witnessed the proposed creation of a special EBD class for adolescents
expelled from regular school for having sold drugs. The primary criterion
to be part of this special education placement was to be in the
business!


The preceding are examples of what may be assumed to be folk-knowledge,
but strongly supported and well documented by researchers in
the field. Yet as a body of knowledge it does not really appear to be part
of the professional expertise of teachers working with EBD students. So
what explains this discrepancy between research and practice?


<b>THE GAP BETWEEN</b>


<b>RESEARCH AND PRACTICE</b>


There are admitedly very few scientific endeavours that compare to the
use by educators of the knowledge base developed by the researchers in
the field of behaviour problems in school (Schiller, 1995). As stated by
Greenwood (2001), compared to science, education is not impressively
effective. Empirical evidence does not support decision making. Practice
is often based on a popular way of doing things and is not in the main
scientifically tested for its contribution to students' learning or achievement.
Government policies themselves are a mixture of ideology and politics
occasionally supported by research.


The lack of knowledge and skills of our teachers in their interactions with
EBD students is problematic, to say the least. More often than not, teachers
have no crisis intervention plan or procedure to rely on when things start to
go wrong, which tends for many reasons to make even special EBD classes
unsafe. In this context, many researchers question the ability of regular
teachers to deal with EBD students in inclusive classroom settings (Cheney
and Barringer, 1995). What is apparent, however, is that even the most
effective behavioural strategies are not well implemented in mainstream
education (Skiba et al., 1997; Wehby et al., 1998).

[p. <i>380</i>]

Many teachers continue to choose less effective methods of managing
behaviour because the impact of introducing research-supported interventions
is not immediately visible to them. Very often, changing their
practice  as proposed by research  is not in itself rewarding and can
even be viewed to be threatening. Another significant impediment is time.
Teachers are reluctant to implement practices that take too much time,
regardless of the promising results (Vaughn et al., 1998). Some issues may
be related to a cost-benefit ratio for certain teachers. If the cost of change
is high and the benefits low or only positive to one student (the EBD
student), teachers may be unwilling to change how they deal with problem
behaviours in their classroom in general (Malouf and Schiller, 1995).


We must bear in mind that teachers and schools are rarely, if ever, sued
for failure to apply the most effective instructional intervention or to
change a practice that is not working or is found to be detrimental to a student's
learning. The common explanation for a student's failure to learn
is based largely on characteristics such as poverty, disability, ethnicity/
language and family, and rarely on the use of ineffective or inappropriate
practices (Carnine, 1995).


Considering the quality of our knowledge base on the preferred teaching
practices with EBD students and the significant problems these students face
during and after their school years, <i>not</i> using the best practices available to
help them succeed in school truly represents an ethical problem. The situation
also has an impact on the quality of research undertaken in the school
setting. When researchers present a new intervention programme for the purpose
of evaluation, an assumption is made that teachers already possess the
core of basic skills required to implement and test this programme. As an
analogy, when testing with a new drug in pharmacology to assess its potential
to cure a specific illness, medical researchers assume that the doctors applying
the research protocol are able successfully to give a patient an intravenous
injection or check their blood pressure. In short, medical researchers trust that
the practitioner participating in a study is able to administer the treatment with
integrity by referring to a background of basic medical skills. We cannot be
so sure when implementing and evaluating a new education programme to
help EBD students succeed academically. This is another reason why we must
bridge the gap between knowledge and practice (Carnine, 1997).


One cannot reflect on the problematic relationship between research and
practice without directly considering the teachers' pre-service and inservice
training on how to work specifically with EBD students. As stated by Sugai
et al. (1997), the initial training given to teachers fails to prepare them adequately
to educate these students. In this regard, if we are to deal effectively
with the quality of education offered to EBD students, the fundamental
issue of adequate pre- and in-service teacher training must be examined.

[p. <i>381</i>]

<b>PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING</b>


<b>FOR TEACHERS OF EBD STUDENTS:</b>


<b>PROMOTING EXCELLENCE</b>


Many would now acknowledge that Schools of Education must revise their
pre-service, curriculum (for specific knowledge and abilities, see Bullock
et al., 1994) in order better to train new teachers on how to educate EBD
students and alleviate conflict. It is imperative that we introduce courses
and training seminars that are coherent with the latest knowledge of our
field and are precisely designed to address practical teaching problems in
today's classroom. What are the characteristics of an effective pre-service
training programme pertaining to the education of EBD students?


Pre-service training must support the development and use of proactive
rather than reactive intervention in dealing with EBD students. It must be
clear to every teacher that two levels of intervention  universal and
specific  must exist within the school. Universal interventions are offered
to each student by means of school rules, classroom rules and social skills
teaching. Specific interventions are tailored, individualized interventions
for EBD students, consisting of consultations, individual educational
plans, self-control and aggression management training and so on. As proposed
by Walker (2000), this pre-service training should focus on solving
problems and developing intervention strategies that will truly work in the
school setting. Therefore, following the initial training received in their
teacher-preparation programme, new teachers should:


 be actively involved in the needs assessment of their students and not
rely solely on the diagnosis of someone who is not a teaching specialist
(Cooper, 1996);


 possess the necessary knowledge base with which to address the different
manifestations of behaviour disorders before they are encountered,
rather than be unprepared and face these specific needs as they
are occur in their classroom;


 have a practical understanding of which services can be applied in the
regular classroom and which should be reserved for specialized settings;


 focus on reinforcing learning and academic achievement in EBD
students instead of targeting their problem behaviours (Levy and
Vaughn, 2002; Ruhl and Berlinghoff, 1992);


 be responsible for the curriculum and teaching components of the
individual education plan (IEP) developed for these students and not
merely the executor of decisions taken by other professionals;


 be conscious of the importance of remaining in tune with the development
of the EBD student, continue to strive for the development of

[p. <i>382</i>]

 be able to read a recent research paper related to innovative
approaches in the field;


 be able to use a model or a paradigm to explain, predict and offer suggestions
to help EBD students;


 always focus on the reinforcement of positive behaviour;


 be aware that maintenance and generalization must be planned and not
left to chance;


 prefer the teaching of replacement behaviour over the use of punishment;


 possess a clear model of reference to deal with crisis intervention, and
in particular with the cycle of coercion that is so prevalent when dealing
with aggressive students;


 know how to organize the classroom environment by establishing clearly
defined rules, with foreseeable consequences when these rules are not
adhered to;


 have developed the necessary skills to establish a confident and trusting
relationship with parents; and


 focus on approaches that enhance the strengths that each child brings
to the classroom (Bullock, 1999).


In-service training must enable teachers to enhance these baseline capabilities
in order that they might integrate new knowledge and skills supported
by research and demonstrably effective practices (Royer, 2001).
This training must become part of the school staffs mission and be an
ongoing career project. We know now that isolated training sessions may
be inspiring or increase awareness, yet these limited, occasional workshops
rarely alter classroom practices. In-service training must therefore be
encouraged by the school administration and will have a better chance of
producing change if some kind of entrapment effect takes place. Should
this up-graded training lead to a more productive classroom environment
as a whole for EBD students  and no doubt decrease the stress felt by
teachers  then these new approaches will be better welcomed as part of
the preferred intervention practices of these teachers. In so doing, direct
consultation and supervision of teachers should become one of the best
ways to train in-service practitioners in the use of behavioural intervention
(Nelson and Rutherford, 1987; Veillet and Royer, 2001).


Pre- and in-service training related to EBD students must, in themselves,
be research-based (Gable et al., 1992). It is therefore imperative
that we continue to support further research in this area itself. Longitudinal
studies on how newly-certified teachers begin in the profession, adjust,
