BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: You never know. But a little bit of dilation might mean that it's zooming (ph).
CLIENT: I know. They were hurting (ph). They were like "Well, it doesn't really mean..." You can't like walk around with -
THERAPIST: It can mean - right. It can mean walk and it can mean something.
CLIENT: Yeah. But I was so surprised.
THERAPIST: It feels meaningful, doesn't it?
CLIENT: I know, yeah. I was like "That's pretty good. We're at two centimeters there so..."
THERAPIST: And how do you feel?
CLIENT: I've been feeling really good, still, which has been awesome. I feel like now it's definitely starting to hit us that it really could be any time, which is really exciting but -
THERAPIST: Because you're at 30 - are you 38 weeks now?
CLIENT: Thirty-eight weeks now, as of yesterday, yeah. So I feel like - every morning how we wake up and how like -
THERAPIST: So definitely within the next four weeks.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because they probably won't let you go more than 41 or 42 weeks.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. And I think our OB really likes to do just 41. She doesn't like you to go too much past that, so yeah, that's pretty crazy, I think.
THERAPIST: So definitely within three weeks you'll have a child.
CLIENT: I know (chuckling). So yeah, we're just getting so excited. But it's also that funny feeling of - I feel like with this past weekend I tried to, like, pack too much into the weekend. Like I also -
THERAPIST: You've got to do stuff before you - before you have the baby? [00:01:10]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I almost wished that I hadn't made it such a busy weekend for us, you know, because then it was almost this feeling of, like, "Well, what if this is our last weekend together?" You know, and that we've like crammed... And it was a fun weekend, like we had my parents come down for dinner to celebrate my sister's birthday. So it was fun stuff, and then we were just running lots of errands, but then there was a little piece of me that I was thinking - I also want to make sure, like, Todd and I have some time together and just have like one boring, lazy day.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I feel like we haven't been very good about doing that, you know, just because he's been so busy trying to tie things up with work. And I feel like, with me, this is kind of like the last week I think I'll have, because next week is spring break, and so we're due like that Sunday of spring break, so I kind of doubt - I mean I might be back but... [00:02:03]
THERAPIST: (Chuckling) It's very likely that you won't be (chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah. Especially because most of my classes are at the end of the week.
THERAPIST: End of the week, right.
CLIENT: So it's weird to think like this could be my last week really of the semester. Like I'm thinking maybe I'll go back the last week of the semester, just to kind of show my face, like not having done the work.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Or anything.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, uh-huh.
CLIENT: So it is kind of like I think there's stuff that we -
THERAPIST: But even if you have to see people you're going - you know, this is certainly the last time of reading and assignments.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And making deadlines.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it's a funny - like I feel like I want to be good and not push myself too hard right now.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And like understand that I am growing a person here. I'm nine months' pregnant. Like I don't want to make myself a crazy person.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But then like this tension of like also wanting to just make sure things are wrapped up and done. And I don't really think I'll - I don't think I'll ever really have that feeling of being, like, "Oh, I'm ready now for the baby to come."
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like everything's crossed off my list. [00:03:00]
THERAPIST: Because what do you - people ask that question, like "Are you ready?" What do you really need to be "ready"? What does "ready" mean?
CLIENT: Right. And that we've been just kind of saying that this -
THERAPIST: So you have a place for the baby to sleep.
CLIENT: Um-hmm. We do, yup. Got a little bassinet in our room now that's been actually in my stepdad's family; been passed through the family for more than, like, a hundred years, which is really cool.
THERAPIST: Oh, wow, that's nice.
CLIENT: Yeah, so we've got that. So yeah, all of the essentials.
THERAPIST: So what else would "ready" mean?
CLIENT: I think it is just like school stuff that's on my mind in terms of - because I think Todd and I have been good about knowing that we've tried to, like, prepare ourselves for feeling unprepared, and that's okay.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And because we're both such planners and that's not like us.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. This is a really hard thing to predict.
CLIENT: Right. And I think we've been, like, all along, really trying to, like, support each other in knowing that this is all going to be totally new and we can't really anticipate it, so we just have to be good about going with it.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And I do feel like that's obviously a challenge for me, like about the same funny feeling. [00:04:02]
THERAPIST: (Chuckling).
CLIENT: But I'm feeling -
THERAPIST: Feeling weird (ph) now.
CLIENT: Right. And that we're kind of in it as a team is nice, too.
THERAPIST: And this is not something that you need to get right the first time.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Parenting, and like figuring out how you guys are going to co-parent is an ongoing process.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, you can go out and get a different brand of diapers if your baby doesn't, you know...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: If the first kind you buy doesn't work.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: If you struggle to nurse, you can go out and buy bottles.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: If, you know... Or you can meet with a lactation consultant. These are not things that you have to get perfect the day you bring the baby home.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: These are all sorts of things that you can figure out as you go along. You're going to get lots of chances.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: To, you know, feed and burp and try to get to sleep and talk to friends and your colleagues.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And, you know, those are all things you can still do.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you may not figure out the perfect balance right away.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: But over the course of time you'll figure out what works for you.
CLIENT: Right. And we are so lucky that we have such a good support network, too. And even my friends from school just threw us a little baby shower, because there's two other girls and my coworker who are pregnant now, too, so they did like a little triple baby shower yesterday. [00:05:16]
THERAPIST: Oh, that's so nice.
CLIENT: So even like on the school end, you know -
THERAPIST: You're having lots of support.
CLIENT: It's really nice, yeah. So that feels good. Like I know that it will be, like - it's fun that Todd and I can figure it out, the two of us, but that we have like this huge circle around us.
THERAPIST: You have lots of people who you can ask questions and commiserate with.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I do feel like now it's like I'm trying to be good about the fact that - that I can be - I'm prepared for it and we can figure it out. But there are like certain things at school that I'm just like wanting to make sure are kind of wrapped up. Especially as like with the responsibility of being a teacher and things like that have been - because I'm the teacher, and I'm pretty much the only person who was the teacher last year as well; like the rest are all new. So people kind of look to me for like the leadership. And so I have been - I pretty much have everything all set for them. Like I've handed things off and delegated and got things done, so for when I'm gone, but that's - like there are little things there that are still loose ends and...
THERAPIST: Are there - what feels left open to you? [00:06:24]
CLIENT: I think because Ryan, the principal, he's trying to figure out if he's going to hire another teacher to kind of work full time for me.
THERAPIST: Yeah.<br />
CLIENT: And he hasn't figured that out. And the students have all their - their first project is due today. And so in my mind, you know, months ago, I was like, "Oh, I can totally have all those grades in before the baby comes and at least that's like one less thing - that that would be done and then the new teacher could kind of take over." But now I'm thinking "I could have this baby any time. You know, I might not have all of those grades (ph) in."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I think it will be comforting to me to know like that he's decided what's happening. [00:07:03]
THERAPIST: Right (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Because then I can just say -
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk) grade a project in between your practice (ph)?
CLIENT: Right. I graded two and carried (ph) the other 14 that I didn't get to and they're the worst (ph), you know.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like because I do feel like, I don't know. Like already that's only six weeks into the semester, but I feel like with the students in our class, like I want to be -
THERAPIST: You want to feel - yeah, bonded to move (ph) it?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, which I was telling myself, I'm like, "Don't let yourself get like that this year."
THERAPIST: (Chuckling). But you did (inaudible at 00:07:28) teacher at heart.
CLIENT: I do. Like I feel - yeah. And responsible to them and just wanting to make sure that they're feeling supported and not like kind of deserted by their teacher. Because we kind of have them in six different groups, so each teacher has a little group of 16 or 17 students, so that (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: They know your face and they know who you are and -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it won't be you.
CLIENT: Right. But they also know that I'm having a baby.
THERAPIST: Right. So it's you don't just disappear for no reason.
CLIENT: No surprise, yeah. But I do think that that will make me feel better, like, to know -
THERAPIST: To know who is your replacement and...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then I have been trying to think, like, what you mean (inaudible at 00:08:08). Well, what's the worst that can happen? And so they might get their projects back graded late or something, because the next teacher would take... You know, it's nothing like the life or death thing for them either. [00:08:19]
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: But it is like just little things that I've been trying to feel like I want all of that, like, wrapped up.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. You don't mind (ph). Well, I wonder if part of it is hard because there's so much uncertainty with the baby that you can't have answers for.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you're working hard to be okay with that, kind of?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, not knowing that having other things that you don't really know either.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's like you've reached your limit of being okay with -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, being (ph) thoughts (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I feel like that my other classes it's better, like, because it's more just for me, whereas with a teacher, being a teacher, there's other people depending on me.
THERAPIST: You feel responsible to other people.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it's also nice because the actual research project that I'm doing that's also a year-long - where I'm working with a teacher, that like, of course, it's just like how research happens. It's getting, like - we're not on our timeline and pushed back. And our professor is so good about saying, "This is exactly what - how research works. Like all of your proposals are totally different now and that's good."
But there are like certain things with the project, too, that there's only a couple of, like, time-sensitive things, and the rest, it's nice. Like we can do in May and June if I wanted to, to kind of finish that up especially, because her school year will probably go in the end of June, so that gives us a nice chunk of time. Whereas if I were - you know, if I weren't having a baby, my final project would be due at the beginning of May. [00:09:44]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I kind of bought myself some time, which is good. But there are like a couple of things; like I'm meeting with her this afternoon.
THERAPIST: So that you're expecting to kind of get back to before...
CLIENT: Yeah. So there's a couple of things there that I just want to make... Because again, like I feel like she's kind of waiting on me, too, whereas my other classes that are just me it's nice that it can be my own thing and I'll take care of it. [00:10:02]
THERAPIST: You can see there's a pattern; it's definitely hard work.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know.
THERAPIST: And there's somebody else that you feel like you're affecting.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or not that you feel like you are, affecting these other people.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I feel like - but it's been nice because I think Todd has really similar feelings right now, that he's teaching two classes actually, and, you know, starting this new program, and people are depending on him. So it's been nice to - it's nice to know that it's not just me trying to figure this out but...
THERAPIST: That you're not crazy.
CLIENT: Yes, in that way.
THERAPIST: You're not crazy if he likes to be having it all.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So that's been helpful, too.
THERAPIST: How intense do you feel like the anxiety is about those things that you don't - those kinds of - the sense?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like what are we talking about on this tense scale?
CLIENT: It actually has been - it's been okay. Like I feel like even sleeping and stuff has been okay. Like there have been a couple of nights that haven't been so great, but I think it's - it wasn't really even having to do with school. Like there was one night for my baby shower. I still have all these thank you notes to write, and of course I wanted to like hand-make the thank you notes. I made them all, but I still want to write them and that's another thing. I was like I really just want to get those out before the baby comes and I... Todd had gone to bed and I stayed up and I was like, "I'll just write, like, five of them and then go to bed," and that was like a terrible thing to do. [00:11:18]
THERAPIST: (Chuckling)
CLIENT: I think it'd just gotten - like it wasn't - I know now not to do school stuff that late at night. [00:11:24]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Because that gets me, like, thinking about school before I go to bed. But I was thinking that would be okay.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But I think it was just like psyching me up for, like, all of these other non-school things that I wanted to have done and so that -
THERAPIST: How it's going to conduct (ph) this, and expectation.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so that was a hard night sleeping, but it had been like the first night that I'd had, besides like the usual tossing and turning and (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: It's hard to get out (ph) to a position at this point (chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah. So that was one night that was a little hard to go to sleep. And then I had another - because that happened, I feel like it was on my mind.
THERAPIST: Yup.
CLIENT: That I had another night. But it wasn't too bad.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. It was talking one or two nights.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: In the span of a couple of weeks.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: In the ninth month of pregnancy.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, which isn't so bad (chuckling).
THERAPIST: So not - so comparatively...
CLIENT: Yeah. It definitely could be worse I think. [00:12:11]
THERAPIST: Oh, sure. It could be way worse.
CLIENT: And it wasn't school stuff either, which I was thinking was kind of funny. You know, like now -
THERAPIST: Funny - I think hopeful, too?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because, you know, these are things that aren't going to be consistent problems.
CLIENT: Um-hmm.
THERAPIST: Like very specific trigger. You know, feeling like, you know, you have this list of thank you's to do.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sparked additional thoughts of things you wanted to get done.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And I think, you know, those are very situation-specific to where you are right now.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it's not a fear that, you know, three months from now, that same type of thing is going to be keeping you up.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You'll be in a different place and...
CLIENT: Yeah. And it's been - it's like I feel like -
THERAPIST: You did okay the next day?
CLIENT: Yes, right, and that's been nice, too, knowing that even if I am feeling tired, like, I can get through the day.
THERAPIST: You can do what you have to do.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And then I was thinking, too, that it was kind of funny that right after we had met two weeks ago, there was something, like some silly worry or something that was on my mind, that didn't, like, affect me sleeping or anything. But it was something that was on my mind and I remember thinking, "I bet I'll forget within the two weeks what it was, because I knew it was one of those things that I just wanted to, like, have a day and I didn't let it go. And I was thinking about it last night, and this morning, too, and I still can't quite remember what it was.
THERAPIST: Can't remember what that thing -
CLIENT: But I think that's like a better sign, too, that it's almost like I know - [00:13:35]
THERAPIST: Yeah. You can let go of these things.
CLIENT: Yeah. And sometimes I know I'll need, like, to sleep and have, like, the next day and it's gone, but that made me feel a little bit better. Because I don't want to think about it too hard because I probably will remember what it was but...
THERAPIST: And it's not like you need to - you know, you don't need to for me.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you also don't need to for you, because that's part of that being - I think part of our goal has been how can you be - feel more self-reliant and kind of trust yourself more.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That you can handle these things. [00:14:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Without needing to check in with Todd or check in with me or your mom.
CLIENT: Yeah, um-hmm.
THERAPIST: And the fact that, yeah, this came up, and you already sort of knew, like, "Ah, that's not going to stick around."
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: And you let go of it on your own.
CLIENT: Right. So that was a good thing, too, I think.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Add it into sort of the mental checklist.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Of things that you can totally cope with.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I think that in - it's so funny to think even now, like, I was thinking it in our next - if we schedule two out, like two weeks out, I'll probably have my baby (chuckling)...
THERAPIST: That might not be the best time to schedule that (chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. So it is. It's like such a funny mixture of, like, being so excited, but there are those like - I think it was this weekend really that it was almost like wanting to make sure that Todd and I had this, like, last time together. And my mom was kind of laughing, because I told her - I was like, "I do feel like we're a little too busy, like I wish we could slow down a little bit." And she was like, "Well, you should try to do that, but it doesn't mean once the baby's born that you're not going to have - "
THERAPIST: Right. You don't have to have your last day now. You can - [00:15:12]
CLIENT: - time to ever again." Yeah.
THERAPIST: There will be a time when you do have, you know, a weekend away.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or time to yourself. The baby will sleep.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You can't get everything in before the baby comes.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you don't have to.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yes, life will change, but life will also go on.
CLIENT: Right. And I think that's good to hear, because I do think, right now, it's like all these, like, "Oh, we should go here, like our favorite restaurant, one last time," you know, but - that we need to, like, get that out of our heads.
THERAPIST: And you can go to restaurants.
CLIENT: Right. Bring the baby, right? Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm. Yeah, they're actually very portable at the beginning.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: And I think, you know, once you get over your - kind of the initial apprehension of, you know, what do you do with this little thing -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - there actually is a nice grace period at the beginning where, you know, they can sleep anywhere.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can take them in their carrier and you can still, you know... [00:16:03]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, they'll fall asleep in the middle of the restaurant. They don't care.
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). We might be, too (chuckling).
THERAPIST: So, you know, there will still be time to do some of those things.
CLIENT: Yeah. So I think that's good to remember, too. Like I do want us to slow down. Like I said, if we get this weekend -
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk).
CLIENT: - I was like we are not making any plan. Like I want to have just a day where we can be lazy and be in our pajamas all day if we want and just hang out and watch movies or whatever we want to do.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: But I was also - I don't want to count on that either, because you never know what will happen (chuckling).
THERAPIST: You may be hanging out and watching movies as a threesome.
CLIENT: Exactly (chuckling). But I do think that that will be good, because I think we both are kind of... I know with Todd, too, that he's feeling - he's doing okay, but I know that he's feeling just like that pressure to get stuff wrapped up at work.
THERAPIST: So it might be nice, you know, to try to carve that out.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And if you're home and without a baby, then you do it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And if you're home with a baby, you can make as much of it as possible.
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling), right. [00:17:06]
THERAPIST: I'm sure you'll spend lots of days in your pajamas (laughing).
CLIENT: Yeah, I will, I know, that's true. That's not something that will end.
THERAPIST: That's not going to end. You may have much more of that.
CLIENT: I know, yeah (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you plan what you can and you just know that at this point you don't have quite as much control as you did before.
CLIENT: Right, yeah, which is good for me because I like to be in control.
THERAPIST: Um-hmm.
CLIENT: And this is a very good -
THERAPIST: It's going to be an excellent opportunity to practice that.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: So what should we do about scheduling? Do you want to put one on for two weeks? Do you just want to schedule for like a month out? Then you'll probably have the baby by that (crosstalk).
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, that's probably a good idea to do a month out.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because I was thinking if we did two weeks then I would like -
THERAPIST: We're probably going to do -
CLIENT: I want to make sure that - yeah, I would want to make sure that I give you enough notice that I need to cancel or whatever.
THERAPIST: You have been waiting for that responsibility, remember?
CLIENT: Okay (chuckling), yeah. But I think probably a month.
THERAPIST: (Crosstalk). Let's schedule about (ph) -
CLIENT: (Crosstalk).
THERAPIST: And if it turns out that you have the baby next week and you want to come in, just call me.
CLIENT: Good, okay. That sounds good.
THERAPIST: You know, I can always - we can find a space if you don't have it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I know we still want relaxation (inaudible at 00:18:12) schedule it before that, because it seems to, like, undo (ph) the relaxation. [00:18:13]
CLIENT: Yeah. And actually, whatever works for your schedule will work for mine.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Because that will be a nice feeling of -
THERAPIST: I guess you'll have a lot of freedom.
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling).
THERAPIST: I don't - oh, so if we do a month out, we're looking at probably April 2nd.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And I'm actually going to be doing - it's Brown's busy season, so I'm going to be going in there a few hours a week.
CLIENT: Oh, really?
THERAPIST: To help them out. Yeah, they get very busy at the end of semester.
CLIENT: Is that - yeah. I was going to say, when is - because the end of the semester is coming up once UI (ph)...
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah. March - end of March and April are very busy at Health Services. So I'm going to be there from 9 to 12 on Mondays, but I could meet with you - and I'm going to come back to my office, but we could plan sometime on Monday afternoon if you want to stick to Mondays.
CLIENT: Okay. [00:19:06]
THERAPIST: Or Tuesday afternoon; looks like I have some flexibility.
CLIENT: It really doesn't make a difference to me.
THERAPIST: That's right -
CLIENT: So if there's anything that's easier for you...
THERAPIST: Okay, so let's do - how about Monday at 2:30? So we're looking at April 2nd.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And do you want to schedule? You have that one hour session?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Do you want to schedule that, since you'll probably have a lot to think about?
CLIENT: Yeah. I think that's a good idea. That would be perfect timing to use that. So, what? Two o'clock? Is that what you said?
THERAPIST: Two-thirty.
CLIENT: Two-thirty.
THERAPIST: Just make a note to myself. Make that your Blue Cross special (ph).
CLIENT: Great (ph).
THERAPIST: And then I will try to keep you posted about the group. I still don't have -
CLIENT: Right. I was going to ask about that, too.
THERAPIST: I still don't have the group of women at the same spot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because it doesn't - it's nice to have a little bit of age mix in kids, but too big of an age mix and then it - completely different set of issues. [00:20:07]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: So I'll keep you posted and hopefully we'll gather a group with, you know, newborns, or at least people in their first year of infancy.
CLIENT: Perfect.
THERAPIST: And keep you posted.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You may talk to your pregnant friends.
CLIENT: I know (chuckling). I will, definitely (chuckling).
THERAPIST: So is there anything else you want to address before we do some deep breathing and relaxation or...
CLIENT: I think that was everything, yeah (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Well, get as comfortable as you can.
CLIENT: Should probably (inaudible at 00:20:34).
(Pause [00:20:35] to 00:20:48)
THERAPIST: Let yourself close your eyes and settle into a pace of breathing that feels comfortable to you.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Shifting however you need to to be comfortable. [00:21:02]
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And allowing your breath to extend slowly, like within your inhales and exhales.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And just start - just let yourself take a mental scan of your body, noticing anything that feels tight or uncomfortable. Think about breathing into that spot.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Exhaling, letting go of any tension.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And in your next breath, then you're going to turn your attention to your head, squeezing your eyes tightly shut as you inhale, noticing where that brings tension to your face, and letting it go as you exhale, letting your eyes remain gently closed and having the tension drain away from your head and your face. [00:22:01]
(Pause)
THERAPIST: On your next inhale, think about squeezing your teeth tightly shut, clenching your jaw; exhaling and releasing your jaw, letting your teeth fall gently apart, noticing how that feels different.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And when you're ready to inhale, drop your chin towards your chest, noticing what that feels like on your neck and your throat. And then letting your head float back up to a neutral position as you exhale, letting the tension drain away from your neck and your shoulders.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Inhaling and shrugging your shoulders up toward your ears, noticing what that feels like in your neck, your shoulders, and your back. And when you're ready to exhale, drop them all the way down, letting the tension drain out of your arms. [00:23:06]
(Pause)
CLIENT: Inhaling and bending your arms, and your hands come toward your shoulders, and noticing a tension in your biceps. When you're ready to exhale, let your hands fall all the way to your lap or your chair, tension draining out of your upper arms.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: In your next inhale, you're going to make a tight fist, noticing tension in your hands, forearms, fingers, and wrists. And when you're ready to exhale, release that, relaxing your hands.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And then your next inhaling is going to turn your attention to your abdomen; just notice what it feels like. And now you exhale and think about relaxing your stomach, and you're bringing the sensation of warmth to your abdomen. [00:24:10]
(Pause)
THERAPIST: In the next breath in, you're going to think about squeezing your knees tightly shut, noticing where that brings tension to your inner thigh and to your legs. As you exhale, think about relaxing that and letting your legs release.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: On the next breath in, you're going to think about pulling your toes up toward the tops of your shoes or up off the top of the floor.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: And as you exhale, relax that, letting your feet fall gently back to the floor.
(Pause)
On your next inhale, you reverse that, pressing your toes down to the floor and lifting your heels up, noticing where that brings tension to your feet and calves. And when you're ready to exhale, let your feet fall back to the floor, relaxing your legs. [00:25:06]
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Continuing to breathe at a relaxed pace. Just take another mental scan of your body and notice anything that feels uncomfortable or tight. Think about taking a deep breath in and relaxing that spot, exhaling and relaxing further.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Continuing to take comfortable breaths, and also scan your mind and notice what thoughts have entered into your head. Notice them without judgment and let them go, letting yourself let go of any worried thoughts. Important things can come back to you.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Let yourself take a moment to visualize something positive, calming. Any image or memory that feels good to you, just take a moment to think about that. Hold onto the good feelings and let yourself come back to the room at your own pace.
(Pause)
THERAPIST: Nice work.
CLIENT: I think that that will be really helpful. I keep saying that, but I really do think that.
THERAPIST: I totally agree with you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Use it however. However you need to, however often you need to.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, even kind of coaching Todd through it so he can coach you back.
CLIENT: Yeah, um-hmm.
THERAPIST: You know, when the time comes, because, you know, it's exactly what most of the labor and birthing practices are based some form on.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So if you can get yourself to relaxed and if you can get your mind focused on something positive, it will help your body through the process.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And just make it more enjoyable.
CLIENT: Right. So it's nice to know I've got a little strategy (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: Yeah. You've had a lot of practice.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you know you've taken your classes so...
CLIENT: That's right, yeah (chuckling). [00:27:11]
THERAPIST: And people will be there to help you through the process.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, [they'll be in the use] (ph), you know, having birthed their baby somehow.
CLIENT: Right (chuckling). That's right. That's a good way to think about it (chuckling).
THERAPIST: So I wish you the best of luck.
CLIENT: Thank you.
THERAPIST: Enjoy every moment you can.
CLIENT: Yes. Yeah, we will.
THERAPIST: And don't hesitate to call if you want something, spur of the moment, rescheduled.
CLIENT: Okay, good. [00:27:34]
