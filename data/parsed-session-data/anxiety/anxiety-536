Manhattan Transfer


Driving across the George Washington Bridge into New
Jersey—the wrong side of the river again—feels like a visit to
the dentist. Mom and Dad greet you as if you've just returned
from another galaxy. Our son, the college graduate. Back home
to recuperate from four years of intensive orbiting and scientific
research. Within an hour, you realize you are living in a mental
hospital. Only here, the walls are wallpapered. Frightening floral
pattern from another decade. All of it presses down on you. The
<i>National Geographic</i> map over your bed. The globe on your desk.
The stamp album. The <i>Penthouse</i> magazines in the exact same
place you left them in the closet. Not much goes on in the suburbs
when you have no schedule and you've just graduated from college.
The next day, you make sunny-side-up eggs and toast at
noon, read the obituaries in the <i>Times</i> (a disproportionate number
of German architects and Hollywood makeup artists from the
1930s), maybe watch some television, and wait until the mailman
comes. You get the feeling that your parents wouldn't mind if you
stayed home for another twenty-two years. You don't do too
much else during your monthlong hiatus except for watching Letterman
with your door closed and sleeping late. Each morning
you're awakened by phone calls from your parents' friends, congratulating
you on your graduation and in the next breath asking
you what you're going to do next. Easy answer. Find an apartment
in the city.

The funny thing is that I have it all planned out. My life, that is. I
am moving to New York to live off my inheritance and make independent
films. Actually, it's only about $25,000 my grandfather
left me when he died my sophomore year in college. But in June
of 1984 it seems like a huge amount of money to me, and somehow
I can't imagine it will ever run out. And since it will never run
out and nobody is telling me how to spend it, the first order of
business, of course, is to buy some cocaine.


In keeping with my "cash shall always flow like water" credo,
I start apartment hunting on the Upper West Side. I don't worry
about finding a job first. It seems like the right neighborhood for a
future yuppie. I don't put much effort into seeing what's out
there. After looking at four apartments within a five-block radius
with one broker, I take the most dramatic, a large studio at 84th
and Broadway. Let there be no pretense of poverty—it's a $1,200-a-month
luxury rental, a great space with high ceilings, brick
walls, and shiny hardwood floors on which I can do my <i>Risky
Business</i> routine in my briefs if I am so moved. And I think I am.
The building is in a gentrified neighborhood—Columbus Avenue
is already a suburban mall choked by bars and restaurants. It
doesn't have much of a view—it overlooks a Sony movieplex next
door—but at least I can fantasize about a movie of mine opening
there one day. It's only four blocks from the notorious Zabar's and
H&H; Bagels, and across the street from Charivari, where I quickly
drop $1,000 on a few pair of pants and a couple of shirts before I
even move in, unconcerned that this represents 4 percent of my
inheritance. There is so much available to me twenty-four hours a
day in my new little neighborhood—and I haven't even ventured
below 79th Street or above 86th Street yet. I'm living on my own
for the first time, and my parents are keeping their distance;
they're not asking too many questions.


I always knew that I would live in New York. After four years
at Wesleyan, I was whirling—an adrenaline junkie, used to sleepless
nights, drug and alcohol binges, and wandering around campus
looking for fun. There was no doubt in my grandiose thinking
that this surge of energy would sweep me here, where I'd choose

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second order of business is to create the ultimate bachelor
pad, due to my need to perpetuate the myth that I am a rich
kid and exude a sense of success. I like the idea of spending this
chunk of money I have, and I take the project quite seriously, consulting
a few magazines and a friend's mother who is a decorator.
I envision a "modern country farmhouse on Broadway," replete
with pine furniture and such uncountryish details as a sectional
couch, a glass-and-metal table, a platform bed, halogen lighting,
and the most up-to-the-minute stereo, TV, and VCR—a place
where a gentleman farmer will be just as comfortable as an investment
banker. I go straight to the seventh floor of Bloomingdale's
and within an hour and a half choose a few pieces from one room
and mix them with a few from another room, making the salesman
very happy. I also pick up a few electronic toys—television,
VCR, stereo, answering machine—and pay for everything with
cash. Later in the afternoon I buy a set of Stendig chairs and
a halogen lamp from George Kovacs, then make a brief stop
at the Whitney Museum to pick up a Fairfield Porter mountain-landscape
poster. Now all the apartment needs is a wine rack, a
case of wine from the liquor store across the street, and some final
decorating touches—a couple of baskets and a few pieces of tumbleweed.
Maybe I can find tumbleweed downtown or just have a
friend pick up some when he passes through Santa Fe.


Determined that the apartment be painted precisely the perfect
color, I become involved in an obsessive search for an earth-tone
paint I've seen in a magazine layout. I remember that it is
called something like Country Paté. Or is it Country Plate? I go
crazy trying to track it down. I have visions of having to smear
the walls with pate from Zabar's to get a sense of what country
pate will look like. Finally I find something close enough, called
Mushroom Mountain. I decide not to attempt the job myself
and hire Calvin, a professional painter and, I learn later, a professional

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first night in Manhattan. I can't stay in the apartment because
the paint fumes are so bad. My friend Lindley Boegehold,
whom I met during a summer job at Macmillan Publishing a few
years earlier, and who is a few years older and wiser, takes me out
to Teachers Too, a neighborhood restaurant, for my Upper West
Side indoctrination. I have the Thai chicken with peanut sauce.
We talk about my plans for my film, which I imagine as a comedy
set in the suburbs. I tell her I think I'll ride the trend in filmmaking
and raise the money independently and make a teenage movie.
She is encouraging and believes that I can pull it off. After dinner I
walk Lindley home and go back to my apartment. When I walk in
and turn on the lights, it feels like a hotel. And it still reeks of paint
fumes. There is no blinking red light on my new answering machine.
Not a good sign for such a popular guy like me. It feels like
the world is crashing down on me because I have no messages.
Fuck it. It's only 10:30 P.M., SO I decide to take a walk down Broadway
and see what's going on. It's a Sunday, so it's pretty quiet on

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I take the subway four stops and surface at Times Square. It's
like a fucking desert. Just with a few thousand more people, and
without cactus and sand. The digital thermometer flashes 94
in bright red, but it feels like someone has turned the heat up to
118 degrees. The streets are swarming with pastel-clad tourists
from Warrendale, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio, wearing
baseball caps, eating hot dogs, drinking canned Nestea Iced Tea,
and smiling up at all of the neon. Everyone is soaking wet. Flashbulbs
bounce off the sweaty, pale faces of fat couples and their
chubby progeny, pretzels shoved in their mouths like pacifiers. I
could be at a county fair in Kentucky. The number of people on
the sidewalks overwhelms me; I feel terribly turned-on and lonely.
No messages on the machine, not even a call from Allison. And
where were my parents tonight?


In Times Square, beneath the veneer of neon lights, billboards,
and theater marquees, is an entire supermarket of sex—
porno theaters, live-sex shows, massage parlors, adult video and
magazine stores, any kind of sex that money can buy. I've spent
my share of time here, and it always feels like I'm on another
planet. Planet Fuck. My model apartment is light-years away.
I check out the row of porno shops on 42nd Street. I thumb
through some magazines—old issues of <i>Penthouse</i> and <i>Oui</i>, shrink-wrapped
packages with three or four hard-core fuck magazines
in them for $7.99. Frustrating when they're wrapped up. You
never know what you're going to get. It's usually raunchy and
kinky stuff. Women putting their triple-D tits in their mouths.
Scrawny men spanking fat women wearing leather. Not a turn-on
to me, but apparently to someone jerking off out there. The soft-core
magazines are more my speed. Guys fucking gorgeous
models from behind. All kinds of videos. Straight. Gay. Bi. Gang
bang. Oriental. Amateur. Maybe I should raise money to make

I'm not looking for a whore tonight. But I also feel scared
about sleeping alone in my apartment. And maybe I'll die from
the paint fumes. I'll be the first to die in my graduating class. But

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Smash


Summer in Manhattan. It feels like I am waiting for the next semester
at Wesleyan to start again. I explore Columbus Avenue,
Amsterdam Avenue, and Broadway and make it my business to
get to know my bank manager and all of the tellers, the dry
cleaner, the owner of the liquor store, the owner of the hardware
store (he actually knows me well from my spree—all of the loot
still unused), the owner of the stationery store, and the guy at the
newsstand. I want to be the mayor of my little five-block neighborhood
as I had been at the campus of Wesleyan. But this is
going to be a tough feat, just from a numbers point of view. I
waste hours wandering the streets, talking to neighbors, and walking
in the park. I often forget that I have come to New York with
the intention of starting an independent film company, which I
have decided to call Smash, suggesting not only a huge hit but also
a sense of being "out of control." It also has a kind of hip British

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I arrive at the Park Avenue apartment at exactly 7:30 P.M.,
dressed in pleated khakis and a navy blue polo shirt, carrying a
handsome black Porsche briefcase my parents bought me in Italy.
I am here to meet the parents of a college friend to discuss the possibility
of their investing in my film project. The doorman announces
that I have arrived, and the elevator man brings me up to
their apartment. I am greeted warmly with hugs and kisses by Mr.
and Mrs. Lehman, whom I haven't seen since graduation day at
Wesleyan. "You both look healthy and tan," I tell them. They've
just returned from Spain. Their son, my friend Todd, is off in Europe
on vacation. Their apartment is exquisitely decorated with
lots of floral patterns: floral everything. In fact, since I walked in,
the Lehmans are becoming floral themselves. I take a seat on the
floral couch and pull out a video of my thesis film, an investor's
packet, and a press kit, with the name Smash Films emblazoned
on it. Mr. and Mrs. Lehman are sitting opposite me on the other

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I go through the motions of working on the project every
day—doing related chores and errands, making telephone calls,
following up with prospective investors. Somehow I think the
money will magically materialize, so I pretend that I'm working
twelve- to fourteen-hour days circulating dupes of my college
video and the synopsis and prospectus, working with my lawyer
and a prospective producer, and hoping to find my angel. Though
I'm on the verge of financial disaster, with almost no money in my

Slave to Fashion


My lucky way out comes in September 1984, when I think about
going back to work at Giorgio Armani, where I had a temporary
job recently over school break. They are rushing to open their first
United States boutique and they desperately need help. They hire
me to start the day after I call them. Good timing. I need the
money, and I can work on my film project at the same time. In the
back of my mind I'm just putting the film on the back burner, confident
that eventually I will make it and pay back my investors. But
I'm curious as to where my next experience might take me. The
next day I begin working in the public relations and marketing department,
on a staff of only six or seven. My experience at Armani
proves to be a crash course in ridding myself of any leftover
naïveté.


The film <i>American Gigolo</i> has provided Armani with tremendous
exposure in the United States, since Richard Gere wore
exclusively Armani in his starring role. Suddenly, Armani is synonymous
with "minimalist chic," and everybody wants to wear
him. The large specialty and department stores are buying up his
clothing, plans for freestanding boutiques are in the works, and

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With the flagship store on Madison Avenue still under construction,
the opening has been delayed several months, so there
is plenty of pressure to speed things up and open in time for
Christmas. There is a tremendous amount of tension between the
boss and her underlings. The Armani empire is run out of Milan,
but the United States fiefdom is directed by a dynamic woman
named Martina Bartolini, who comes just about up to my waist
and barks orders in Italian (to those who speak it and those who
don't) or in her bastardized English. Intent on creating a huge
splash for Armani in the United States, she supervises an army of
construction workers, lighting experts, display and visual artists,
and floral designers working around the clock to ensure that her
austere boutique at 815 Madison will be the jewel in the crown.
She runs Armani like a mini-Mussolini, and many around her find
her laughable.


I serve as her gofer, secretary, assistant, and jester, trying to
lighten the mood of an extremely tense group of people who take
fashion a bit too seriously, as if it is a science and we are an emergency
medical unit, rescuing the world from bad taste. I work
ridiculously long hours, sometimes up to sixteen a day. Whatever
Martina demands, I do, from writing press releases about the next
season's line, working with media people consigning clothing for
fashion shoots, and assisting in publicity to picking up meals from
hot spots like Mezzaluna or espresso from Gardenia. For the first
time, I get an up-close look at a slick world I had only seen in the
movies and magazines. I remember one shoot we do for <i>Amica</i>, an
Italian magazine, featuring Matt Dillon in a bathtub surrounded
by beautiful underage female models.


From my first day at Armani, I start consigning clothing to
Myself—suits, jackets, sweaters, leather jackets, anything lying
around the office that I consider to be a sample and that looks
great on me. I'm thrilled each time I leave the office at the end of
the night with new clothes, and I become addicted to acquiring

<i>October 3, 1984</i>.


I'm on the crosstown bus headed to work, frantic that I'll be late.
The day begins at 8:00 A.M. and I make it with just enough time to
pick up some coffee and settle at my desk, which is stacked high
with fashion magazines and covered with yellow lined legal paper
on which Martina has illegibly scrawled memos and letters to be
typed, unalphabetized files, and pink message slips from yesterday,
which was technically only seven hours ago. My coworkers arrive
in the office, dressed magnificently but looking tired and drained
from working into the early hours. Martina is in her office with
the door closed, but you can hear muffled Italian seeping out
through the walls. Ellen, the receptionist, who is the only employee
dressed in a wrinkled navy blue skirt with an unpressed
white blouse sticking out, sits out in front of the elevators typing,
organizing files, and shuffling papers. The understated waiting
room, in which the only decoration is a white orchid on a single
black table, fits the Armani mantra: minimal, minimal, minimal.
Inside the office, Rafael, a public relations assistant, argues on the
phone in Italian; his hair is perfectly in place, and he is dressed
impeccably in his navy blue blazer and gray flannel pants. Olivia,
the accountant, is busy with her calculator, her head buried in
a pile of checkbooks and ledgers. Tina, the office manager, is running
around from floor to floor, trying to keep everything under
control, nervous that we're not going to meet our deadline. And
Clare, the office public relations consultant/stylist/gossip, walks
in at around 10:30 A.M., because she's been out at a party until
4:00 A.M. She entertains us with the names and details of the
celebrities she was with. "Quasi celebrities," I say. I start typing
Martina's memos when Tina asks me to help her organize the
back storage area because I'm tall enough to reach the top shelves.
Martina comes out of her office with a snarl on her face and asks
if I can type two letters and have them messengered as quickly as
possible. I crank them out right away, she signs them, and I call a

The Pill


I'm visiting Allison at Yale, the fall after my graduation, and we
come back to her dorm room slightly drunk after dinner one evening.
There's a message from her mother on the answering machine
about some unpaid bill. Slight intrusion. I take off my pants
and T-shirt and lie down in bed and watch as she strips in front of

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My relationship with Allison becomes more serious, and we
start spending more time together. She is finishing her final year at
Yale and she spends the weekends with me in Manhattan. There
are so many notations in my datebook about our incredible sex
("great night of sex," "up all night," "hot sex"). It seems like the
perfect relationship, but it clearly isn't. I don't know how to communicate
with her. I take on a very controlling role in the relationship,
minding her day-to-day activities and taking care of her
errands and appointments. I try to make her life as simple as possible,
and she becomes accustomed to my omnipresence. When
we first started sleeping together, she used a diaphragm, and I
would do the prep work. I thought it was fun, real teamwork. But
she tired of this nightly ritual, and her doctor recommended that
she go on the pill. Now each night I remind her to take her pill,
and if she's too lazy, I pop one of the little peach tablets out of the
case and give it to her with water. I also keep track of her menstrual
cycle in my date book, so we know when to expect her next
period. When it's late, we are thrown into a panic. We're not talking
to each other; she's crying and telling me that this time she's
sure she's pregnant. Each time I assure her that she isn't and show
her the calculations. I suggest that we go out to dinner. It'll happen
by tomorrow morning. She's only two days late. We go out to
Nishi for sushi. She comes home and gets her period. It's the

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Years earlier, the loss of Allison's virginity to someone else left
me crushed. She was dating a guy a year younger, and I was constantly
jealous. One day she called me, sounding scared and on the
verge of tears. "Andy, what am I going to do?" she asked. "I think
I might be pregnant." I assured her, for some reason, that she
probably wasn't pregnant but that I would make an appointment
for her to see my mother's gynecologist, Dr. Strauss, a man in his
early seventies. It was to be our secret. "Please, don't even tell
your mother," she pleaded. "Have you told Tim?" I asked. "Not
yet," she said. The appointed day came, and we drove in my red
Kharmann Ghia to Dr. Strauss's office, which was located in his
house in a very nice neighborhood in Englewood, New Jersey. I
waited in the car listening to the radio for about forty-five minutes
wondering what was going on inside. She walked down the steps
and toward the car, got in, and looked like she was about to cry.
"So, what happened?" I asked. "He examined me and took some
blood and urine and I'll know in a day or so," she said. She reached
over and gave me a big hug. "Thanks. Thanks a lot for this," she
said. The next day she called and told me she wasn't pregnant. I
was relieved, but I really didn't want to talk to her. I was still angry
that she had lost her virginity.


The Pimp


Several weeks after I start working at Armani, some of the Milan-based
executives come to New York to check on the progress of
the U.S. empire. They are busy in daily meetings with Martina, in
photo sessions, and with the press, and I am at their beck and call.
I order cars and limousines for them, fetch their lunch, make
reservations, and pick up tickets for Broadway shows. They are
staying at the Carlyle Hotel, and some of them want videos of foreign
films—Jacques Tati, Luis Buñuel, Jean Renoir, Fritz Lang, and
Jean Cocteau—as well as gay porn. I am sent in search of the

Soon I become friendly with these working boys. Most of our
contact is on the phone, but sometimes we'll meet for a drink just
to talk. Jason is a twenty-three-year-old med student at NYU,
strong-looking and healthy, with blond hair, bright blue eyes, and
a great smile. Once as we're standing outside the Oak Bar at the
Plaza Hotel a middle-aged man dressed in a beautifully tailored
suit approaches us and asks if we'd like to join him for drinks in
the bar. Jason nods at me. "Sure, we'd love to," he says, and we follow
the man into the smoky bar. We find a table, and he introduces
himself as Henry Alton. He shakes Jason's hand and then
mine. "Andy," I say. When the waiter comes, Henry orders three
shots of Jack Daniel's for the group. He leans back and takes a
deep breath. "So, boys, tell me a little about your lives in New
York, won't you?" Jason tells him he's a medical student, and I tell
him I work for a well-known fashion house. He seems equally impressed
by both, which I find amusing. The waiter returns with
our shots, and at the count of three we down the awful-tasting
whiskey. "It's good medicine," says Henry. "I'll get us another."
He signals the waiter. "Now tell us a little about yourself," Jason
says. "I'm just a real estate investor from St. Louis and I get to
New York as often as I can to enjoy the finer things: the museums,
the theaters, the restaurants, the shopping, and the men." "Yeah,
there's some good shopping here," Jason says. I try to hold back
my laughter. We all drink our second shot of whiskey. "Boys,
would you be interested in coming back to my hotel room at the
Waldorf for a little romp?" he asks. "The both of us?" I ask. He
nods. "$350 for two hours, plus a tip," he says. "I think that's a bit
low. How about $500?" asks Jason. Henry excuses himself to go to
the bathroom. We order another round of drinks and are really
getting drunk. It seems like the bar is closing, and Henry hasn't
come back yet. "I have a strong feeling that Henry isn't coming
back," says Jason; "I don't think he liked that we turned down his

On the Couch


Around the beginning of December, a strange combination of extreme
anxiety and depression takes over me. My moods are unpredictable
from day to day. Sometimes I feel fantastic for weeks,
then I take a dive. Allison urges me to get professional help, and I
start seeing Dr. Myron Levitt, a psychiatrist on the Upper East
Side. He has paternal qualities that I like—he's gentle and caring—
but he speaks in a monotone that practically hypnotizes me. I am
under extreme stress, because of the failure of the film project and
my financial situation. I have tremendous amounts of energy,
which I don't know how to channel or control. I create compulsive
lists of errands, possible job leads, people to call, things to buy, and
doctor's appointments. I get nothing done. There is too much
swirling around in my head—I can't contain it all in my brain.


<i>December 16, 1984. 8:45 A.M. Upper East Side</i>.


As usual, I'm early for my 9:00 A.M. appointment with Dr. Levitt,
so I stop to pick up a bagel and chocolate milk at the corner deli.
I'm sitting in his waiting room staring at a horrifying piece of art
hanging on the wall—a black-and-white abstract image that looks
like an anorexic's severed arms, folded. The print is slipping down
into the mat. I want to mention it to him, but I keep it to myself.
The waiting room is furnished with "contemporary" pieces from
the seventies: a brown knotty couch, a chrome arched lamp, glass-and-chrome
end tables, and two wooden chairs with cushions.
Nothing matches. I'm not comfortable here. It isn't clean enough
for me. I have to work out my issues in a clean environment. I
don't understand what's causing how I feel every day I wake up,
whether it's anxiety or depression, and I feel like they need to operate
on me. I don't want to open myself up and get infected by
his psychoanalysis in this shabby office and die on his fake Oriental
rug. I'd prefer to be lying naked, covered by just a sheet, on a

Triple-XXX Live Acts


The third week in December, Brent Cummings is appearing at the
Follies, and he wants me to come see him there. I stand at the top
of the steps leading down to the entrance and, as usual when I'm
at a porn show, I look around nervously before I descend. I take
one step down. It's like I'm putting my foot into an icy-cold swimming
pool. It's too late to stop—anybody might be watching. Like
friends of my parents or an old high school English teacher going
to see a Broadway show. The walls going down the steps are covered
with photographs of bare-chested boys and men, and I wonder
if they're the same guys inside getting ready to go onstage.
Sitting in the ticket booth is a man I can barely make out but who
looks like Mr. Wizard from my chemistry set. Superimposed on
the glass over his forehead is a sign that reads ADMISSION $6.1 smile
and give him my most masculine "Hey."


"You here for an audition?" he asks. "Yeah," I respond without
the slightest hesitation.


He signals me to walk through the turnstile. I am in a dark
vestibule.


"What's your name?" he asks.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Eric. Eric Colter," I say. Not a bit of thought. Where did that
name come from? He shakes my hand and I smile. His name is
Jerry. My name is Eric. Inside the dark theater I can see about fifteen
men bathed in light from the screen on which two skinny
young blond kids are in a sixty-nine position. There's no way either
could be older than sixteen. This is not a turn-on for me. I'm
a little nervous now, a bit afraid. Something about this place repulses
me. It's musty and smoky and not very clean. Jerry asks
me if I've danced before, and I tell him that I have, just not in
New York. San Francisco. And Montreal. He calls over a well-built
young guy and introduces him to me as Justin. Justin is an all-American
hunk. Tall, broad-shouldered, dark complexion, bright
green eyes, not quite good-looking enough to be a model, and
he's just wearing a towel wrapped around his waist.


"My real name is Joe, but they like Justin better. It sounds
more porn-star-like," he says. This leads me to believe Jerry's
name might not be Jerry either. But what does Jerry have to hide?
Justin is posing in front of a mirror. It's funny I chose a first and
last name. Almost as if I intend to have a serious career in porn.
Justin tells me he's from West Virginia. He leads me back to the
locker room, a dingy gray-painted space with exposed wires, bad
overhead lighting, and a few benches. He sits down on a bench, his
abs not moving an inch.


"Have you ever done this before?" he asks.


"Does it look like I haven't?" I say. I take off my sweater. I'm
just wearing a T-shirt underneath. Justin kind of looks me over.


"There are six shows each day. The lineup switches every
Monday. It's a much better place to work than the Gaiety. The
clientele is more upscale and has a lot more cash to burn." He
starts oiling up his chest and arms. "Better tips and better private
shows," he explains.


I'm not sure what Justin's talking about. He tells me it's really
easy. "They announce your name, put on some music, you walk
onstage fully dressed and then strip down to your underwear or
jock, dance around the audience a little, and then come offstage
and get a hard-on." He makes it sound like such a normal thing to

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Sounds easy enough. $10 a show plus tips and privates," I
say. "And you can really get up to $50 for a private on the premises?"
I ask.


"Yeah, a jerk-off thing. There's a narrow hallway in the back
for that. Or you can do something outside for whatever you can
negotiate," he tells me.


"I like to negotiate."


Justin tells me there's a star of the show, a guy named Brent
Cummings, who has just appeared in a new porn film. I pretend I
don't know him.


"And he's bi, too. Are you bi?" he asks.


"I guess so," I say.


"Well, are you into pussy?"


"Yeah, totally. I've got a girlfriend uptown," I tell him.


"You should bring her down here one night. Maybe we could
all bang her." He throws his head back and laughs.


The show starts at 8:30 P.M. and the rest of the guys are coming
into the locker room, most of them eating their dinner. Something
is making me nauseous. Maybe it's the sight of those two
skanky teenagers outside on the screen combined with the smell
of fried chicken in the locker room. Those boys could never dance
at a place like this—they'd be heckled and booed. In walks the star
of the show, Brent Cummings. He's a strapping Adonis with a
handshake like none I've ever felt. (The only person I've met with
a handshake that even comes close is Bill Clinton, as I discovered
years later when I met him at a fund-raiser.)


"So, you came down to see me? Gonna audition tonight?"
Brent asks me. He speaks in a dull monotone voice like Dr. Levitt
and seems bored with having to perform tonight. Jerry pops his
head in and tells me I go on last, which gives me a chance to watch

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Brent takes the stage, and the audience cheers. The theater is
filled with his fans. They've all seen his movies: the one where he
fucks a cheerleader on a bench press and the one where three guys
on a diving board take turns sucking his cock. He struts his stuff
awkwardly, with a kind of Vegas-style stride, taking off his shirt
first and then stepping out of his jeans to reveal a pair of white
briefs. He turns his back to the audience, spreads his legs, and pulls
his briefs down a bit in the back, revealing a tan line. Then he turns
around and shows a little bit of blond pubic hair. He really doesn't
dance, he just touches himself and tugs at himself a little. But it
doesn't matter. He grabs his cock and makes a mock grimace, to
the audience's delight. I can do that. He comes backstage and gets
undressed, his cock already hard. He oils up his chest and his
thighs and asks me to do his back, butt, and legs. He strides back
onstage and the audience claps and whistles. He stands with his
back to them, then turns around, covering his cock with his hands.
From where I'm standing, I see the red spotlights bounce off his
chest. He walks into the audience and pulls his hands away, and
guys from both sides of the aisle start grabbing for his cock and his
ass as he moves from shadow to shadow to collect tips, all the time
stroking his big dick. This is going to be a hard act to follow.


The announcer introduces the final act: Eric Colter. I have no
connection to the name. I do kind of a silly jog out onto the stage.
The lights are practically blinding me, and I can't see the crowd.
I'm wondering how many people in the audience recognize me. I
dance to the music—Madonna's "Like a Virgin"—the best I can. I

Private Dancer


The dichotomy of my smart yuppie lifestyle on the Upper West
Side and my career stripping and getting jerked off in a seedy
Times Square theater is surreal at times. When I take the subway
downtown, I stand next to passengers dressed just like me wondering
where they're going and if they would believe me if I told
them where I was going. I think I can do anything and be anyone.
And being a stripper and hustler seems entirely logical. I have no
idea what is going to happen next in my life, but this feels right for
now.


The risk of hustling gets me high. Most of the situations I get
myself into demand very little of me sexually. I try to be careful,
to simply function as an exhibitionist. It is my role to arouse these
men, and I don't mind showing off my body. Most of them ask
me to undress and masturbate for them while they jerk off; others
just sit and stare. But soon I realize that I am really the voyeur—
watching what's going on between the customer and myself.
Sometimes my mood changes and I get so depressed by what I'm
doing that I feel like I'll get stuck doing this forever. Fortunately,
it's only a few nights a week and a couple of times a night. One
night I head to the Edison Hotel with a customer, a guy in his
midthirties in town from Miami, and he seems friendly. I'm in a
pretty good mood, and we're just talking about living in New York
versus living in Miami, the pros and the cons. He wants to enter
the hotel separately and have me meet him at his room. Fine. He
opens the door as if we've never met. "C'mon in," he says. Soon
he's naked and playing with himself while I'm taking my clothes
off for him. The eleven o'clock news is on, this nice guy from
Miami is jerking off in this crummy hotel room with bad overhead
lighting, and I'm undressing. I should have gone straight
home tonight and gone to bed.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few regular customers just want to take me out to dinner or
find out more about me, which feeds my narcissism. I never reveal
anything about myself, and the dinners tend to be quite routine
and boring—I end up doing more listening than talking. I am Dr.
Myron Levitt.


One night after the last show I meet a man at the theater who
seems to be what I term "a safe bet"—respectable, well-dressed, in
his midforties, and Ivy League-educated (so he later tells me).
He's a psychiatrist who lives on Fifth Avenue in the 70s. He asks
me out and tells me not to worry about money. We can go out for
a drink or to his apartment, my choice. As usual, I go for the bigger
option. We take a cab to his apartment, walk into his stark
lobby, past his doorman, who, I realize, is probably used to seeing
him bring home guests. His wife and kids are on vacation in
Nantucket. He proudly shows me around his apartment, which is
filled with spectacular Asian art pieces. I don't remember if I tell
him I'm in law school or an actor—I mix them up. I prefer the anonymity
and enjoy the game. I am nervously awaiting his plan for
me. And then he tells me that he is into what he calls breath control,
which involves playing with gas masks and plastic bags, the
Hefty lawn kind. He explains that he is fascinated by choking and
strangling fantasies. I am a bit naive, and scared to death. Are we
going to be playing out these fantasies? Dressed or undressed? I
must seem hesitant, because he tries to reassure me by telling me
that I don't have to take my clothes off. Is that supposed to calm
me? He leads me into the bedroom—there are photos of his wife
and children on the night tables. I hesitate and tell him that I don't
think I'm interested. But I do end up playing a little, because I'm
somewhat curious and he's promising me money. When he goes
into the closet and pulls out the gas mask—the World War II kind
that looks like a horse's head—I must look shocked. I take my
shirt off anyway and fold it neatly on the bed, then step out of
my jeans and throw them across a chair. He puts the mask over my
head, and I see myself standing—just in my briefs—in the mirror.
The sight horrifies me. He asks me to take off my briefs, and I
strip down. I find it frightening that the seemingly nice, healthy

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There are others. Plenty of them. A rather obese man in his
late forties approaches me after a show, introduces himself as
Scott Zohn, and asks for a private session with me. Standard. He
seems nice enough though not very attractive, and I tell him that
I have a room down the street at the Fulton Hotel. He tells me that
he wants me to come back to his office at <i>Time</i> magazine. He's a
theater critic there. I've read some of his reviews before, and he
strikes me as a little nervous after he discloses his identity. We take
the elevator to his floor, and he leads me through a maze of desks
and into his office, which overlooks the city. He leaves the door
slightly ajar and instructs me to pull my jeans down to my knees,
show off my ass, and then jerk off on his latest review. How I get
myself excited I don't remember, but I come on the magazine
pretty quickly while he plays with his cock. I am embarrassed and

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It didn't take much to get me onstage, and soon I feel as comfortable
as Brent getting the crowd aroused, walking into an audience
of horny and appreciative businessmen who applaud and
have cash to burn. Brent teaches me how to hustle a client, and
I am letting guys give me blow jobs and jerking them off for
$50. This becomes a routine activity for me, a business deal, like
fund-raising. I am making $500 a day (including hourlong private
sessions) and have built up a decent clientele—doctors, lawyers,
businessmen—most claiming to be heterosexual and liking me because
I am, too. There is quite a bit of confusion here. I am drinking
too much, taking amphetamines, and doing coke again. I love
the idea of being good during the day and bad at night. The incongruity
thrills me.


After the last show one Friday night, there are only a few guys
hanging around looking to hook up, but none of them turn out to
be serious customers. So a group of four dancers walks over to
Howard Johnson's in Times Square for something to eat. I always
get the same thing: a clam roll and a chocolate shake. I stare and
count the hundreds of people as they pass by the big picture-frame
window. When the check comes, Jason, the med student,
picks it up, turns it over, and says, "Who made the most money
today?" Everyone responds at the same time: "You did." So he
ends up paying the tab. We walk out onto Broadway. "I'm not
ready to call it a night, guys," says Jason. I'm not either. "Let's
head downtown," I say. Corey takes his vial of Dexedrine from his
jacket pocket and gives me a handful. He keeps promising me
he'll get me a hundred. "I need something to wash these down
with," I say. They just speed me up and make me feel on top of
things. Donovan, the kid from Alberta with the weird-looking
curved cock, is staying at a friend's apartment in the West Village,
and he invites us back there to party. We stop at a Korean deli and

My first homecoming at Wesleyan—returning to campus for
the first time since graduation, seeing old friends and friends who
are still there—provides another bizarre contrast. We go to all the
frat parties. Most of my friends are in law school, business school,
or graduate school, or have entered the business world. Dressed in
impeccable stolen Armani, I feed them all the bullshit line that I'm
making an independent film while I am really pimping and prostituting
and hanging out in dark porno theaters in Times Square.
Very impressive.


One night, a husband-and-wife team from Philadelphia meets
me at the Follies and escorts me back to the St. Regis Hotel. They
are friendly, in their midforties, and they offer me a drink when we
get upstairs to their deluxe suite. I have a glass of champagne with
them, and we share a joint. He asks me to undress, and I quickly
remove my clothes and lay them on the bed. She stands next to me
and starts playing with my hair while he pulls me toward the bathroom
door and ties my hands behind my back and explains that
this is how they like to play. I'm too scared to try and get dressed
and call this whole thing off and leave the room, and I'm too curious
to protest. After I'm tied securely to the inside of the bathroom
door with rope that she pulled out of a dresser drawer, they
both, fully clothed, begin fondling me and kissing me. After about
twenty minutes they tell me they'll be back soon, and they leave.
After about an hour goes by, I realize that this is a disaster, that
these people may never return and I may be in big trouble. I can't

Three's a Crowd


<i>May 17, 1985. Upper West Side</i>.


It's the last day of classes at Yale. Allison moves in tomorrow.
We've been looking forward for months to living together and
having all of our things in one place. I make lots of room for her
things, clear out space in the closets. She has no idea about my
other lives—and I'm almost glad that these identities will wither
away.


I tell myself the crazies will most likely go away, and I won't
stay out, or be allowed to stay out, until four or five in the morning,
roaming the streets and dabbling in all kinds of lascivious behavior.
Her presence will keep me under control. I'll be on her
schedule. Of course, real mania is marked by delusional thinking.


Less than a week after Allison moves in, we realize that there
is no way we can live together comfortably in a studio, no matter
the ceiling height. We both hate living in one room. We're on top
of each other. She's drying off after her shower in the "living
room" and I'm trying to squeeze by to make breakfast. Having another
person around all of the time without a break is driving me
crazy. I'm used to going out at night, picking up <i>The New York
Times</i>, and taking hourlong walks down Broadway to Columbus
Circle and back without telling anyone else where I'm going.


I don't like the way Allison has organized the closets. She
doesn't have a system. She doesn't think she needs one and

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I start looking at ads in <i>The New York Times</i> for one-bedroom
apartments on the Upper West Side. We'll have to increase our
rent by about $500 per month at a time when I have very little
money in the bank, but I won't let that minor detail get in my way.
But when it comes to an apartment, for some reason I place no
limit on what I will spend. I want Allison to have a nice place to
live. The first place we look at is in a renovated landmark building
at the Level Club on West 73rd Street, between Broadway and
West End Avenue. The apartment is a simple one-bedroom for
$1,650, which is extremely expensive, but I'm fully confident that
I'll be able to pay the rent. I'm also counting on Allison to pitch in.
I am sold on the marble lobby alone. I push for this apartment. I
know it's out of my league at the time, but go ahead and sign a
one-year lease, thinking that somehow I'll probably be able to buy
an apartment in the building within the year anyway. I imagine I'll
find some executive-level position soon and make a six-figure income
and my financial problems will be solved. I know it is a
choice that makes Allison nervous, but I do it anyhow. I like that it
makes me feel a little stressed and edgy. It's a risk. Signing the
lease creates the sense of danger and excitement that I thrive on.
So what if we're evicted.

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the meantime, with the very little money that we do have
saved, we spend a week relaxing on the beach at a resort off the
coast of Venezuela. After we return, we are visited by Brad, a
friend from college, and the three of us are sitting around our
apartment watching television. Brad and Allison have always been
a bit flirtatious with each other and are putting out some sexual
energy sitting on the couch next to each other. It's exciting watching
my friend and my girlfriend interacting like this, and I'm curious
about what's going to happen next. Brad has always told me
about his attraction to Allison, and she's told me about her interest
in him. Now I'm aware of a strong sexual energy between all
three of us. It's very quiet except for the television, which is reporting
a big hurricane in the Caribbean. Brad leans toward Allison.
"Is it okay?" he asks me. "Sure," I say. She reaches for him and
looks at me for my approval. I nod. Now here I am, the voyeur
boyfriend, and I'm watching in amazement as things unfold. But
after he leaves, Allison is quiet and doesn't want to talk much
about it. Somehow, I've crossed a boundary by allowing this to
happen. I don't think she ever has the same kind of trust in me
again. But we never speak about it.


To take my mind off things, a few days after we move into our
new place I start snooping around the building looking at apartments
and talking to the doormen, and soon I find out about an
apartment in the building that's for sale. Buying an apartment
would add an element of pressure to my life at this point that I
want to add. Not only would it provide me with a tremendous
challenge, it would increase the pressure to produce and create,
and trigger the anxiety and fear that keep me functioning at a frantic
pace, making my daily life exciting. More responsibilities and
obligations give me an incredible sense of purpose and satisfaction
and keep my ego high. So I go see a broker. Although in
fact I barely have enough to pay the rent, I think I can easily write
the owner a check for the entire amount. It's a one-bedroom,
719 square feet, for $195,000. Great southern exposure. Even before
I see it I tell the broker I'm almost certain that I'll take it. Get
me two. Break the wall down. Make one big apartment. I go see a

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My one-year anniversary of trying to produce an independent
film is coming up, and the fantasy is ending. Thank God. It's a big
flop. I haven't come up with the money. Not even close. And what
I have raised, I've spent on junk that I can't even account for. I
don't know if I'm depressed or relieved that I'm throwing in the
towel. I owe my investors a small fortune, about $50,000.


The Queen of Schmooze


My sister Nancy has a public relations firm that represents several
doctors. She is twenty-four years old, beautiful, smart, and driven.
And she has real chutzpah. She is the only person I know who can
walk into Yves Saint-Laurent on Madison Avenue in the middle of
the winter and ask if they have a pair of shorts in the stock room
that she can try on. She had worked for a small PR firm for a year,
quickly picking up the tricks of the trade and fine-tuning her
schmoozing skills. She was unhappy and unappreciated at the
agency, so one of her clients there, Dr. Stuart Berger, offered to set
her up in her own business, which she now runs from her apartment
on the East Side. She attacks the promotion of his book, <i>Dr.
Berger's Immune Power Diet</i>, with everything she has, booking him
for print interviews and on television and radio shows. Although
he is a diet doctor to the stars—singer Roberta Flack and ballerina
Leslie Browne were patients—Dr. Berger is a hulking six-foot-five,
365-pound man who sweats profusely, is known to ingest huge
amounts of cocaine and alcohol, and has a horrible Percodan

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have always maintained that Nancy has the most finely developed
schmoozing skills, no doubt one of the reasons for her
success in public relations. She gets a call from Dr. Robert Giller, a
well-known nutritionist and holistic practitioner with celebrity
friends like Halston, Bianca Jagger, and Liza Minnelli, who wants
to discuss the possibility of hiring her to promote his book, <i>Medical
Makeover</i>. She meets the young doctor, who is as well known
for his art collection as for his B12 shots, in his Park Avenue office.
In his meticulous study, he is sitting behind a contemporary desk,
wearing a white coat, waiting to hear her pitch. He doesn't appear
to have much time, but Nancy's not quite ready to begin. She engages
him in conversation about her success with Dr. Berger's first
book and retells the story of booking him on <i>Donahue</i>. Giller
seems impressed. She promises that she can deliver even more national
exposure than Berger received and that his book can become
a number-one best-seller in less than two months. "I know
the producers of two of the biggest shows, and they'll use you for
the full hour," she tells him. He just stares at her. "How do you
know you can do it?" he asks. "Trust me," she says. Then she outlines
a ten-city national book tour. "We'll hit all the best shows
with the highest ratings," she says. Giller is liking this PR woman.
"Is this going to stretch far into the summer?" he asks, beginning
to worry about all of this interfering with his summer plans in the
Hamptons. "That should be your biggest problem," she says. She
warns him that his office will be flooded with new patients, and
he seems to get nervous. "You'd better expect it, your phones will
be ringing off the hook," she tells him. "You're a young, good-looking
guy who's going to be great on television." She makes
him feel good and gives him hope for a best-seller that he didn't
have fifteen minutes ago. She tells him she wants to set him up

Brother-and-Sister Act


I'm spending the weekend in the Hamptons at Nancy's summer
share. Even though I'm the loser brother, for some reason I'm feeling
a little high anyway. This weekend is supposed to cheer me up,
give my pale complexion some color, help me to relax and give me
a chance to think about plans for the fall. Allison and I sit around
Nancy's pool one late afternoon drinking Amstel Lights and eating
guacamole and chips with her friends. Nancy starts talking
about the success of her business and brings up the issue of my
coming to work for her full-time. Embarrassing. She loves to bring
up the ridiculous. Is she serious? Sometimes I can't tell. I mean,
I can't imagine anything crazier than my sister and me working
together—we're siblings and we're much too competitive. And I
couldn't think of any job worse than working <i>for</i> my sister. Part-time
or freelance work would be fine—I need the income—but
taking a full-time job with her would be beneath me. I can't bear
the thought of her being my employer. I'd feel like a small child
again, and she would be the rebellious teenager. I could just start
my own PR business or launch another type of business or go
back to Armani if I was desperate. But after a few more Amstel
Lights, Nancy insists that we'll make a great brother-sister team
and it's such a great opportunity and what else am I going to do?
She has a point. She makes it sound great. She tells me she's already
got three clients on retainer and several interested in meeting
with her. She wants me to take care of all of the writing and
proposals, work my old contacts, and structure the business. And
it's a guaranteed weekly paycheck. It seems like she's acting genuinely.
And she's always tried to protect me.


We have a barbecue, and somehow before we go to bed we're
not only working together but we've become equal partners in a

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the early fall, Nancy and I are referred to our first
"celebrity" client—at least we think she is a celebrity—socialite
Cornelia Guest, the "Debutante of the Decade" and the daughter
of C. Z. and Winston Guest. Cornelia has developed quite a reputation
as the youngest of the Studio 54 gang. Her business manager
from the company that handles her trust fund calls us in,
ostensibly to promote her new humor book, <i>The Debutante's Guide
to Life</i>. But what we really do is keep her life calm and under control.
We involve her in some charity work and get her some good
press and try to keep her name out of the club scene. She lives
high up in Olympic Tower, overlooking Fifth Avenue and Central
Park, with her little West Highland terrier, Lyle, in a lavishly over-decorated
one-bedroom apartment. As you walk into the apartment,
an imposing square Warhol portrait of her stares out from
the wall. It is an impressive home for a twenty-three-year-old, and
Nancy and I simply pretend that we are just as successful and
wealthy. We dress and act the part, the way we have always been
taught by our parents. Nancy handles more of the day-to-day activities
of the "Cornelia account," which she both enjoys and
despises, while my relationship with Cornelia is more ironic. Neither
of us takes any of this too seriously. She has unbelievable
delivery and a fantastic, racy sense of humor. I ask her if she is interested
in working on a project for a group involved in ending
homelessness. "I'll do anything to end homelessness—anything,"
she says, Lyle curled up on her lap.


We continue to represent Dr. Berger, who drives around Manhattan
from gala events to pseudoglamorous openings in the
backseat of his navy blue Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce, snorting cocaine
and drinking vodka. By this time, Allison is working for him
as an assistant, so I am privy to all the inside stories about what is
really going on in the office, wild stories of throwing away blood

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002353303-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I approach an energetic producer I know at <i>ABC World News
Tonight</i> to pitch him a story idea on the dark side of Dr. Berger.
This is not your usual pitch. I believe Dr. Berger has taken advantage
of patients and also of my sister and me, financially. We are
furious at him, but don't turn away his checks. The producer has
heard some other gossip about Dr. Berger and thinks it's a great
story. At around the same time, Dr. Berger makes an arbitrary decision
to clean house, and he fires Nancy and me and several people
on his staff, including Allison and a few of our friends. I quickly
organize a group of ex-employees to go on camera and speak in
disguise about his quackery. Of course, Dr. Berger is shocked
when the piece airs, and it is the beginning of more investigations
into his practice.


Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Giller is determined to have a
number-one best-selling book and is willing to do whatever it
takes to reach that spot. Nancy and I mastermind a publicity tour
and handle it like a presidential political campaign. We are on the
phones constantly, trying to get through to our contacts at the
major national television shows. Once we finally make contact
with the producer, we have to make a pitch in thirty seconds. We
get only one shot. The pressure is enormous. We sell Dr. Giller's
book as the most modern approach to changing overall health
through diet, vitamins, exercise, and nutrition and link him to his
successful celebrity clients. In the first two months we book him
on <i>The Sally Jessy Raphael Show</i> and <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, turning
his book into a number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-seller. We talk
to producers and editors in the fifteen largest television markets in
the country, booking him on local shows, setting up radio and
print interviews. I become particularly passionate about this book
because I enjoy watching the sales grow weekly, in proportion to
the work we are doing. The high that I experience from turning
this commonsense book into a best-seller is phenomenal. Then
my behavior becomes obsessive—I don't want to see him fall from

High-Wire Act


At home Allison and I are like two little kids playing house. The
only things holding the relationship together are sex and spending
money. Our communication is increasingly limited. Many nights I
smoke a little pot before going to bed. One night I lie naked waiting
for her to join me, and when she walks into the bedroom her
entire body is glistening with oil. It's the most erotic sight. We're
making love and for a while everything is fine with us again. But
then, just as quickly as it started, it's all over.


Allison and I make another move in 1986—an incredibly
ridiculous one way above our heads, a $2,300 huge duplex on the
second and third floors of the same building, overlooking the
lobby. It has an enormous living room, one bedroom, two full
bathrooms, a loft/den, and gloriously high ceilings. We hire a decorator
and start working on it right away, even though Allison has
stopped working for Dr. Giller and is spending her days playing
housewife, taking care of our two cocker spaniels, and working
out.


Soon I find myself just as addicted to the gym as Allison is. At
the beginning of the new year, 1987,1 start an intense exercise and
diet regimen—cardiovascular workouts and lifting four times a
week with Sean, my trainer, an actor in his midthirties who has no
qualms about making me work hard, or about sharing the weekly
dilemmas of his private life. I have an incredible amount of energy
that isn't absorbed by work, and I've fallen for the "no pain, no
gain" motto. I make notes in my date book—no dairy, no meat, no
bread, no pasta, no sugar. I'm not eating much except for protein

It's January, and we're starting to have problems with our
landlord because the apartment is freezing cold. We walk around
bundled up in layers of clothes shivering, and our landlord does
nothing. I decide to withhold rent, and we become involved in a
bitter legal battle. Until he fixes the heat, I will not write another
rent check. Defiant, I ignore all warnings from the court. We are
finally evicted several months after we start withholding rent. This
puts an incredible amount of stress on our relationship. Allison
and I barely speak to each other, and she blames me for my poor
handling of the situation, believing that I was too aggressive. Allison
decides it's best that we move to separate apartments. We're
both forced to quickly sign separate leases and start packing boxes
of clothing and dividing up what we've accumulated together.
This is Allison's idea, and I am opposed to it from the beginning
because it's such a dramatic response, but I agree to continue the
relationship with these living arrangements. We find a new home
for our dogs with a family in Connecticut.


When we realize that the problems in the relationship are so
serious that they might bring it to an end, we start seeing a therapist
in New Jersey, Dr. Dworkin, whom we are referred to by Allison's
parents, who think we're both a little bit crazy at this point.
Our relationship has seemed headed toward marriage in the next
few years, as our friends are getting married, and eventually we'd
like to start a family, so we are extremely cautious in handling our
problems. Yet neither one of us is in any particular rush to get
married, and it's not even an issue that's discussed for a few years.
Our parents are perfectly comfortable with our living arrangements
and never question us about our plans. Allison seems somewhat
jealous of my work and of Nancy and feels I don't pay as
much attention to her as I used to, and she's angry that I am so
work-obsessed. Seeing Dr. Dworkin is extremely inconvenient,

At a dinner party at her apartment one night, my friend
Lucy Lehrer from Wesleyan and her boyfriend, Dan, introduce
Allison and me to her friends Lauren and Jonathan. Lauren works
as a personal assistant to film director Jonathan Demme, and
Jonathan, her boyfriend, works at <i>The New Yorker</i>. Allison and I are
quite taken with them. Jonathan has angular features, intense
green eyes, and light brown hair and looks like a character Norman
Rockwell might have painted. Lauren has dark hair and dark
eyes and looks like an Italian movie star. They met at college.
They are sitting next to each other on a loveseat; Jonathan is drinking
a beer and Lauren a glass of wine. When they stand up to say
hello, we see that Jonathan must be six-feet-four. It's a pretty small
apartment, and we're squeezed around a cocktail table. Jonathan
and I make eye contact in reference to the spatial problem, and I
realize that we share a similar sense of humor. Jonathan is fascinated
by what I do. He can't get over the fact that every plastic surgeon
has a PR agent. "Dentists, too," I tell him. That really makes
him laugh. Lucy serves the quiche, which she proudly tells us she
has made herself, and it looks delicious. We all start eating. "Lucy,
you used a goddamn graham-cracker pie crust," screams Lauren.
We all start laughing. It's a fun evening, and when we're leaving
we realize that we live on the same block as Lauren and
Jonathan. We make plans to get together with them soon.


The PR business often takes me to the West Coast, mostly to
Los Angeles. Driving on the freeway there, listening to the radio,
makes me feel carefree and euphoric. I'm staying at expensive hotels
racking up huge bills, paid for by the company, entertaining
prospective clients and just enjoying myself for the first time in a
long time. I've never felt better. The freedom of being on my own
leads me to believe that I need more independence when I return

I leave the company with only a handful of loyal clients, taking
as many as I can from my sister. The next day I start scrambling
for more, going back to old clients, scraping new ones from
any place I can find them, including the Yellow Pages. That night I
see Allison, who is glad that I've finally stopped working with my
sister and thinks that I've made a great decision to work independently.
She's extremely encouraging and tells me I'll have my business
off the ground in no time. It's exactly what I need to hear. A
few days later she surprises me with the news mat she's ready to

But after a little while I get a strange sense that Allison doesn't
know how much time and effort I'm going to have to put into my
new PR agency to maintain my old income. I'm concerned that
she'll resent the amount of time I devote to work. Already it's beginning
to feel like the undoing of a bad marriage.
