<i>Behavioral Cardiology
in Clinical Practice</i>
</b>


Heart disease continues to be the
number one killer of men and
women in the United States, where
myocardial infarctions (MIs) occur at a rate
of about 1.5 million per year. For about 30%
of these patients, death is sudden and the
first "symptom" they experience. Ischemic
heart disease or coronary heart disease (CHD)
is predicted to remain the leading cause of
death worldwide through 2020. Despite
these compelling statistics, the survival rate
from acute coronary events continues to
improve, and more than 1 million people
survive acute coronary events annually in the
United States. Thus, issues pertaining to
psychological functioning, behavioral risk,
and quality of life are increasingly relevant as
heart patients face more favorable prospects
for recovery and rehabilitation. Assessing
and treating these patients' health risk behaviors,
such as smoking, obesity, fatty diet, lack
of exercise, nonadherence to medical regimen,
social isolation, and emotional status
(e.g., depression, anger, anxiety) is essential
to secondary prevention efforts and is critical
for optimal recovery of function and general
health.


The modern evolution of behavioral cardiology
arguably began during the mid-1970s
with the work of Friedman and Rosenman
(1974) on "Type A behavior." Since that
time, behavioral scientists and clinicians in
collaboration with medical colleagues have
considerably expanded and refined our
understanding of the relationship among psychological,
emotional, psychophysiological,
and behavioral factors in the development,
maintenance, and exacerbation of CHD.
Given the increasing clinical role of behavioral
clinicians in managing heart patients,
this chapter provides (a) a brief review of
the etiology of heart disease, (b) a cognitive-behavioral
case conceptualization of CHD,
and (c) a pragmatic presentation of the clinical
issues for assessing and treating patients
with coronary artery disease.

<b>Psychophysiological and Biomedical Aspects of the CHD Patient</b>

<b>
<i>Atherosclerosis</i>
</b>


Atherosclerosis is defined as the buildup
of plaques (e.g., "blockages," "stenoses,"
"lesions," "occlusions") typically composed of
lipids, complex carbohydrates, and blood
products along artery walls. The development
of atherosclerosis is multidetermined and
progressive unless the condition is vigorously
treated. By the time a cohort reaches middle
age, half or more will have some amount of
atherosclerosis. However, some people reach
advanced ages of 80 years or more with little
or no clinically significant atherosclerosis.
Therefore, although a number of etiological
risk factors have been identified, our understanding
of the etiology remains incomplete.
However, most of the currently accepted risk
factors (aside from family history, sex, and
age) are modifiable by medication, changes in
lifestyle, or both.


When patients have lesions at one site
(e.g., coronary arteries), it is highly probable
that they will have lesions at other sites (e.g.,
carotid, femoral, or renal arteries). Blockages
that are large enough to threaten blood
supply, and thus to threaten oxygen flow to
critical areas (e.g., heart, brain, kidney, legs),
produce transient ischemia (i.e., reversible
oxygen supply/demand deficit) or permanent
damage secondary to infarction (i.e., tissue
death due to cessation of blood supply).
Large plaques (50% or greater blockage) are
associated with a higher risk of infarction.
Interestingly, although large plaques may
threaten adequate blood flow locally, chronic
deprivation of an adequate blood supply to
the heart can provoke the development of collateral
arteries around the occluded sites as a
remarkable biological compensatory strategy.
These collateral arteries then provide natural
bypasses in the event of infarction of the main
trunk. Also of note, although large blockages
are more likely to produce an infarct, the
much higher prevalence of "small" lesions
(less than 50% occlusion) means that most
MIs (absolute number) actually occur at sites
with low-level occlusion.


Atherosclerosis will follow a "stuttering"
course marked by periods of growth, stasis,
and (sometimes) regression. Plaques may be
fibrous and stable, or they may be unstable,
containing a pool of dead cells and lipids covered
by a thin membrane or cap and eccentric
in shape. When this cap ruptures, the contents
of the pool are thought to provoke thrombus
formation (i.e., clot), sometimes self-resolving
(but perhaps provoking angina) and sometimes
evolving into a full blockage of the
artery (MI). Fully 85% to 90% of infarctions
are believed to be caused by this sequence. The
cause of plaque instability is thought to be
chronic recurring inflammation, perhaps with
some causal contribution from genetic factors
and/or infection with <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i>
(Ridker, Hennekens, Buring, &amp; Rifai, 2000;
Ross, 1999).


Precisely what triggers a rupture remains a
matter of debate (Allen &amp; Scheidt, 1996),
although it has been hypothesized that elevated
emotional states may be one triggering mechanism
secondary to emotion-aggravated contractility
of the heart, blood pressure changes,
increased blood viscosity, vasoconstriction,
and/or localized vasospasm. Thrombogenesis
is certainly encouraged by various psychobiochemicophysical
events, including via stress
reactivity pathways. For example, elevated circulating
catecholamines and platelet aggregation
are associated with states of acute fear
or anger (Markovitz, 1998). Heart rates and
diastolic and systolic blood pressures rise,
sometimes precipitously, in response to even
mild transient and contrived stressors in the
laboratory (Goldberg et al., 1996; Ketterer,
Freedland, et al., 2000). Daily life stress is typically
more meaningful and chronic, provoking
more intense and prolonged emotional burden

[p. <i>281</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00291&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Note that even when accounting for all of
the factors in epidemiological studies, only
about half of cases of ischemic heart disease
can be explained (Farmer &amp; Gotto, 1997).
Although most infarctions are probably the
result of unstable plaque rupture, 2% to
10% of all infarctions in the human heart
occur in the absence of any atherosclerosis,
and another 5% to 10% occur in a part of
the coronary vascular tree without plaque.
Thus, acute thrombus formation can occur
independent of plaque rupture. It is now
believed that the occurrence of a MI requires
something beyond atherosclerosis.


Depending on location (which determines
the amount of heart muscle affected by cessation
of blood flow) and the presence of collateral
circulation and/or anatomical variants in
the coronary vascular tree, the size and significance
of an infarction can vary widely. MIs
considered large will generally decrease the
heart's pumping function (i.e., ejection fraction
[EF]). A normal EF (i.e., the proportion of
blood ejected from the left ventricle during
systole) will average about 66% in the heart of
a healthy adult but includes values above 50%.
Unless the patient engages in strenuous
physical activity, EFs above 40% may be undetectable
by the patient. EFs below 40% define
heart failure, and this generally affects routine
physical function (i.e., dyspnea, fatigue, and/or
dependent edema). With EFs below 20%, the
patient may be considered for a transplant.


<b>
<i>Angina</i>
</b>


Angina pectoris refers to transient chest
pain or discomfort resulting from ischemia of
heart muscle. The discomfort occurs secondary
to an oxygen supply/demand deficit.
Hence, strenuous physical activity that
increases the heart's workload is a common
trigger. Most commonly experienced as chest
"discomfort" (e.g., pain, pressure, fullness,
squeezing), angina sometimes manifests as
arm pain, jaw pain, lower back pain,
headache, nausea/vomiting/upset stomach,
cognitive confusion, dyspnea (i.e., shortness of
breath), dizziness, syncope/near syncope,
and/or weakness. Stable angina has well-delineated
triggers (typically physical exertion
and sometimes stress) and responds well to
nitrates. Unstable angina is far less predictable
and is often accompanied by severe and prolonged
pain. The presence of unstable angina
is clinically considered an acute coronary
event requiring emergent care because it may
be caused by plaque rupture.


Angina is generally presumed to result
from ischemia, but this "causal" relationship
is less than perfect (e.g., Krantz et al., 1994).
Importantly, the symptoms of angina are
shared by a wide range of other conditions,
including acute emotional states, psychiatric
disorders, and other medical conditions, making
differential diagnosis difficult at times
(Richter, 1992; Schwartz, Trask, &amp; Ketterer,
1999). Most episodes of ischemia captured
on Holter monitoring in both laboratory testing
and in vivo settings are not associated with
chest pain/pressure or other symptoms, typically
referred to as silent myocardial ischemia.
(A Holter monitor is a small portable device
that collects electrocardiogram [ECG] data on
a continuous basis during daily life.) Furthermore,
most episodes of chest pain are not
associated with ischemia as measured by surface
ECG ("atypical" or "noncardiac" chest
pain). In fact, recurrent emergency room visits
by cardiac patients for chest discomfort without
evidence of ischemia/infarction are quite
common.


Angina is strongly associated, with depression/
anxiety, and cognitive-behavioral treatment of
emotional distress has been found to reduce
episodes of angina and ischemia (Blumenthal
et al., 1997; Ketterer, Fitzgerald, et al., 2000;
Lewin, 1997). Pain intolerance secondary
to depression/anxiety, or ischemia/angina

[p. <i>282</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00292&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because angina is the major driving force
behind medical system use, treatment of emotional
distress may reduce this use (Black,
Allison, Williams, Rummans, &amp; Gau, 1998;
Davidson, 2000; Frasure-Smith &amp; Lesperance,
1998). Recently, Schwartz and colleagues
(1999) proposed a spectrum approach to chest
pain management (e.g., pain and palpitations)
that includes presentations consistent with
pain/anxiety, Syndrome X/nonischemic chest
pain, Prinzmetal's angina, and angina pectoris.
Because psychological and behavioral problems
are similar in angina and other forms of
chest discomfort regardless of the underlying
cause, disease management strategies should
be multidisciplinary. The rise of "chest pain"
clinics for nonemergent chest pain attests to
greater recognition of this overlapping and
complex problem.


<b>
<i>Arrhythmias</i>
</b>


The heart contracts and relaxes in a highly
orchestrated fashion or rhythm to efficiently
move blood from the venous compartment
(deoxygenated blood) to the arterial compartment
(oxygenated blood). This is a two-phase
process in which the heart fills during the
relaxation phase (diastole) and then the heart
forcefully empties during the contraction phase
(systole). This orchestration is electrochemical in
nature and is maintained by a specialized cluster
of cells collectively called the sinoatrial node or
natural pacemaker. Disruption of this sequencing
is referred to as an arrhythmia. Arrhythmias
can range from benign to malignant. Of
particular clinical significance are <i>sustained
ventricular tachycardia</i> and <i>ventricular
fibrillation</i>, the presumed causal culprits in
sudden cardiac death. Note that the ventricular
portion of the heart is the primary pumping
chamber for the brain and general body. There
are a number of factors (e.g., drugs, disease,
infarction, emotional distress) that can produce
abnormal rhythms, many of which can be serious
or even life threatening. In severe instances,
blood, flow may slow sufficiently to cause acute
brain failure (syncope). When the heart has been
thrown into inefficient sequencing of its contractions,
cardioversion (transthoracic electrical
shock) is used to achieve a normal sinus rhythm.


Patients at high risk for future life-threatening
arrhythmias will likely receive antiarrhythmic
medications that regulate heartbeat,
pacemakers, and (in severe cases) implantable
cardioverter defibrillators. This latter device,
like the pacemaker, is placed inside the body
and can function as an "onboard" crash cart
that greatly improves both sudden cardiac
death and all-cause mortality relative to
medication management alone (Gilkson &amp;
Friedman, 2001). However, there is growing
evidence that the device itself can produce
problems of behavioral or psychological maladjustment
in a significant subgroup of
patients (for an excellent review, see Sears,
Todaro, Lewis, Sotile, &amp; Conti, 1999).


Behavioral clinicians are particularly familiar
with the <i>sinus tachycardias</i> most characteristic
of panic attacks and other acute anxiety
and mood states. Importantly, clinicians must
be aware that patients can and do develop anxious
presentations from more dangerous heart
rhythms as well (Schwartz et al., 2002). Also,
there is considerable evidence that the subjective
symptom of palpitation correlates poorly
with underlying cardiac rhythm (Barsky, 2001;
Barsky, Cleary, Barnett, Christiansen, &amp;
Ruskin, 1994), as was described previously for
chest pain. Although it is generally acknowledged
that panic spectrum disorders can and
do masquerade as cardiac problems, the
reverse is also true. To illustrate the complexity
among anxiety, palpitations, and cardiac

<b>
<i>Hemodynamics</i>
</b>


This chapter has already alluded to the
notion that the heart can develop compensatory
strategies in the presence of heart
dysfunction/disease (e.g., development of
collateral arteries as a natural bypass).
Hemodynamics is the study of the forces
involved in the movement of blood through
the circulatory system. It is through the study
of these processes that one can understand the
physical and functional changes that occur in
the diseased heart as it attempts to maintain
homeostasis in the body. A simplified version
of the process is as follows. As the EF of the
heart declines in heart failure, or with infarct-related
heart muscle damage, the heart begins
to struggle to push blood out into the body,
creating a variety of physical changes in the
heart's structure over time. This process,
referred, to as <i>remodeling</i>, can be characterized
by heart enlargement, thickening of the heart
walls, and leaking heart valves that regurgitate
blood as the heart becomes more inefficient.
This inefficiency is manifest in wall motion
abnormalities. Wall motion abnormalities
can be visualized by blood pool radionuclide
imaging (technetium sestamibi) or on echocardiogram.
Localized perfusion defects can be
visualized by uptake of radioactively labeled
glucose (technetium pyrophosphate or thallium).
This type of diagnostic testing is thought
to reflect impairment of blood flow to an area
of heart muscle. This impairment can be
reversible when the patient is not being
stressed, or it is "fixed" (present when the
patient is both at rest and stressed), implying
permanent tissue death ("infarction").
Likewise, certain patterns on the ECG (<i>ST segment
depression</i>) reflect ischemia or infarction.
Table 15.1 presents some of the common
cardiac diagnostic and treatment procedures.


<b>
<i>Cognitive-Behavioral Case
Conceptualization of CHD</i>
</b>


Understanding the factors that contribute
to both acute and chronic aspects of CHD
would be incomplete without consideration of
the psychological, emotional, and behavioral
characteristics of the patient or the patient
population. The clinical study of these unique
risk factors and their modification is at the
very "heart" of behavioral cardiology. Given
what is currently supported by the evidentiary
literature, a general cognitive-behavioral conceptualization
of cardiovascular disease development
and rehabilitation can be constructed
on the following assumptions:
<table>

<p>
1. Many of the biological processes that underlie
cardiovascular disease develop over time
out of health risk behaviors and lifestyles.
These risk factors for CHD are relevant to
disease development, maintenance, and

and complicating conditions such as emphysema,
type 2 diabetes, pulmonary hypertension,
and heart failure.

2. Lifestyle and behavioral risks are generally

causes them to become habitualized as
a consequence of frequent and persistent
practice, thereby making them particularly
resistant to intervention. For example, a
pack-a-day smoker receives 70,000 infusions
of nicotine during the course of a
year; that is a number of "hits" unparalleled
by any other recreational drug.

<b>Assessment of the CHD Patient</b>

<b>
<i>Screening</i>
</b>


Identification and triaging of emotionally
distressed patients from cardiac settings often
requires the use of an objective, psychometrically
sound questionnaire to aid clinical staff
in recognizing distress. There are a number
of well-validated self-report measures for
assessing CHD patients, and most focus on
emotional status, functionality, and/or quality
of life. Table 15.2 lists some of the commonly
used, tools and the underlying
constructs they purport to measure. Any of
the psychometric instruments validated as
prospective predictors of cardiac outcomes
could be used, but they are clearly redundant
in terms of their predictive utility (Ketterer
et al., 2002). Because of brevity, nonstigmatizing
content, and ease of administration
and scoring (many CHD patients will
become frustrated with lengthy questionnaires
or test batteries), the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS). with a cutoff
of 13 or greater, is recommended (Herrman,
1997). The chapter authors suspect that

<b>
<i>Clinical Interviewing
(Functional Analysis)</i>
</b>


Evaluation should, as always, include a
thorough psychosocial history, mental status
exam, and review of cardiovascular risk
factors (Table 15.3 lists the domains to
consider in an initial evaluation). Importantly,
this evaluation should include identification
of barriers to change as well as cardiovascular
risk factors. Behavioral assessment models
have long been used in the functional analysis
of problem behaviors (Barrios, 1988), including
illness behavior (Schwartz, Gramling, &amp;
Mancini, 1994). Because the modifiable
risk factors for CHD are deeply embedded
in the psychology and behavior of the patient,
approaching the initial assessment of the
patient can be greatly facilitated by using a
functional-analytic framework. The Stimulus-Organismic-Response-Consequence
(SORC)
model (Goldfried &amp; Sprafkin, 1976) is one of
several common models and is used here for
illustration purposes.


<i>The Stimulus (patient triggers or hot buttons)</i>.
The <i>stimulus</i> portion of the SORC
model refers to the triggers or cues that
evoke health risk behavior. Stimulus control
variables relate to cardiovascular risk in a
number of ways. Overt behaviors such as
substance abuse (e.g., nicotine, alcohol,
cocaine), lack of exercise, and acute emotional
reactions can have a broad range of
environmental and cognitive triggers. For
example, it is not unusual for the mere presence
of a critical supervisor to trigger acute
autonomic arousal and concomitant emotional
distress (e.g., anxiety, anger, irritation,
worry), even when there is no current overt
conflict. Therefore, it is imperative to identify
the patient's triggers (or buttons), noting that
patients may vary greatly in their understanding
of or insight into the functional
relationships between triggers and emotional
or behavioral responses.


<i>Organismic Variables</i>. Organismic variables
are the dispositional characteristics of the patient
(e.g., genetic, physiological, temperamental,

[p. <i>286</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00296&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I024&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>The Response</i>. The response describes the
target risk behavior itself (e.g., eating a fatty
meal). The response can also be operationalized
as a nonbehavior (i.e., failure to act) such
as an inability or unwillingness to engage in
regular exercise. In addition, behavioral risk
includes not only overt acts or failures to
act but also covert behaviors such as certain
cognitions. Table 15.4 lists some of the common
maladaptive cognitions to assess in the
CHD patient.


<i>Consequences</i>. There are several factors that
affect the power of a consequence to shape
behavior. Many of the risk behaviors seen
in the CHD patient are highly overlearned,
habitualized, and/or otherwise resistant to
change. Understanding the ways in which these
behaviors are reinforced or maintained is critical
to the secondary prevention process. Timing
is particularly important in health risk behavior.
As a general rule, temporal proximity of
behavior and consequence will wield greater
influence over the behavior. As noted previously,
many risk behaviors provide immediate
gratification. In particular, it is important to
view the CHD patient's actions as maintained
by relief from negative affective states.


<b>
<i>Emotional Status</i>
</b>


There are several emotional domains that
have consistently proven themselves to have
robust relationships to cardiac outcome and/or
are relevant to individual work with the CHD
patient (for an excellent review, see Rozanski,
Blumenthal, &amp; Kaplan, 1999). Assessment of
depression/dysphoria, anger/hostility, stress,
anxiety, and alexithymia is essential in a thorough
evaluation of the CHD patient. It is
important to note that many patients may present
with subclinical levels of emotional distress
(relative to cutoffs for traditional psychiatric
patients), and these levels may still be clinically

[p. <i>287</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00297&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I025&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Obtaining two or three adjectives for affect,
and then obtaining concrete examples where
these imply chronic conflict, for each significant
other (e.g., parent, sibling, spouse/lover, child,
boss) facilitates efforts toward mapping the
patient's psychosocial stressors. This can also
provide some clues as to how the patient
construes and responds to others and as to the
success of these coping patterns. Of particular
importance are overlearned/automatized coping
responses (which are presumably learned early
in life and are often outside the patient's

[p. <i>288</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00298&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Depression</i>. There are now numerous published
reports linking depression and depressive
symptoms to adverse cardiac outcomes
(e.g., Booth-Kewley &amp; Friedman, 1987;
Carney, Freedland, Eisen, Rich, &amp; Jaffe,
1995; Cassem &amp; Hackett, 1973; Frasure-Smith,
Lesperance, &amp; Talajic, 1993). Based on
this evidence, depression should now be considered
an established independent risk factor
for CHD outcomes (Glassman &amp; Shapiro,
1998). Unfortunately, there are not yet any
randomized controlled trials of sufficient
methodological rigor to demonstrate a reduction
in CHD morbidity or mortality as a
result of treating depression either psychotherapeutically
or psychopharmacologically.
However, SADHART (Zoloft vs. placebo)
and ENRICHD (stress management plus a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]
vs. standard care) are ongoing clinical trials
targeting depression in CHD. What can be
said with some certainty is that CHD/depression
comorbidity does affect patient functionality,
compliance, and quality of life such that
assessment and aggressive treatment where
indicated is an essential part of comprehensive
care regardless of the impact on CHD-specific
morbidity and mortality.


<i>Anger</i>. The work of Friedman and
Rosenman (1974) on the Type A personality
identified a number of characteristics that
tended to cluster together and appeared to be
associated with cardiovascular prognosis.
Apart from ambition, "busyness," and
constant effort, these characteristics include
cynicism/mistrust, stubbornness/opinionated,
perfectionism/demanding, alexithymia, controlling/
overcontrolled, impatient, and worrier/
obsessional. Importantly, not one of these
characteristics can be argued as pathognomonic
of the syndrome, nor does any
appear to have a direct effect on the genesis or
exacerbation of CHD. Rather, these characteristics
are of importance because they tend
to foster a hostility complex or "AIAI" (<i><b>a</b></i>ggravation,
<b><i>i</i></b>rritation, <b><i>a</i></b>nger, and impatience).


Although the literature has been marred by
inconsistent operational definitions, psychometric
problems with self-report measures,
and a more complex relationship between the
AIAI construct and CHD than was originally
conceived, it nevertheless remains prudent to
assess the patient's ability to modulate anger.
AIAI has been proved to be a causal factor for
CHD in a randomly assigned, controlled clinical
trial of cognitive/behavioral stress management
that targeted AIAI and reduced
death/Ml rates by 37% relative to placebo
controls (Dusseldorp, van Elderen, Maes,
Meulman, &amp; Kraaij, 1999; Friedman et al.,
1986, 1987).


A related issue concerns <i>confrontation
avoidance</i>, where conflict with either family
members or coworkers often leads to "stewing"
(anger) or chronic anxiety. This has been
conceptualized as the "anger in/anger out"
issue. This can occur for a variety of reasons,
including the Type A who despises but will
not discuss conflicts with his or her boss and
the Type A's spouse who is afraid of expressing
his or her disagreement over even trivial

[p. <i>289</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00299&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Anxiety</i>. The data supporting a relationship
between anxiety and CHD is perhaps more
complex and less compelling than those supporting
depression. As stated previously, acute
anxiety might play an acute role in plaque ruptures,
arrhythmias, and blood pressure.
Anxiety has been implicated as a major risk
factor for CHD in multiple prospective risk
factor studies, particularly for death or sudden
death (Kamarck &amp; Jennings, 1991; Ketterer,
1999; Kubzansky, Kawachi, Weiss, &amp;
Sparrow, 1998). Unfortunately, no large-scale
randomized control trials exist, nor are any
under way, to examine treatment in this population
and cardiac outcomes. It should be
noted that acute digoxin toxicity (e.g., tremor,
loss of appetite, confusion) may mimic anxiety.


<i>Alexithymia</i>. Many CHD patients are
found to display some degree of alexithymia,
which refers to difficulty in identifying and/or
labeling emotional states in self and others.
Patients with this disorder will display a
poverty of vocabulary in reporting their feelings
and describing other people's personalities,
and they will typically not explore
psychosocial circumstances as possible causes
of their problems. They will present as emotionally
concrete (as opposed to metaphorical)
in talking about what appear to be emotionally
charged situations. When exploring their
psychosocial circumstances, it is necessary to
gently probe for concrete event/behavioral
details because these patients rarely volunteer
information spontaneously because they frequently
view it as irrelevant. Alexithymia can
make it difficult for many patients to benefit
from traditional psychological intervention,
although they are typically good at complying
with behavioral assignments.


<b>
<i>Substance Use</i>
</b>


Assessment of substance use, particularly
tobacco products, is particularly important in
any evaluation. Smoking is a powerful predictor
for many diseases, including CHD. If the
patient is an active or recent smoker, immediate
referral for Zyban or an SSRI and possible
nicotine replacement should be facilitated
(Edwards, Murphy, Downs, Ackerman, &amp;
Rosenthal, 1989; Ketterer, Pickering, Stoever,
&amp; Wansley, 1987; Murphy, Edwards, Downs,
Ackerman, &amp; Rosenthal, 1990). Smoking is
such a potent predictor of outcomes that hesitation
is not prudent unless the patient insists
on thinking it over. The patient should be
taught techniques to avoid smoking cues (e.g.,
bars, sitting around after meals) and to disrupt
smoking habits (e.g., smoke with the opposite
hand, change brands, smoke menthol), and
should, be taught relaxation procedures to help
control acute urges prior to setting a contracted
quit date (preferably during a psychosocially
quiescent period). Giving the
patient 24-hour-per-day access to the clinician
during the first month of cessation is a privilege
that will rarely be used or abused, and it seems
to assist some patients in managing their
impulses.


Although not a common problem in this
population, chemical dependency (e.g., cocaine,
alcohol) should, be ruled out. It is a futile exercise
to try to treat emotional distress in someone
whose central nervous system is under
assault by fluctuating levels of psychoactive
substances. Detoxification may be necessary
before further treatment can proceed. Note that
prolonged, alcohol abuse can result in cardiomyopathy.
Prevalence rates for cocaine
abuse in CHD do not exist, but it is clear that
chronic cocaine use, particularly when smoking
is the route of administration, can lead to early

[p. <i>290</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00300&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Sleep Apnea</i>
</b>


Sleep apnea is a periodic cessation of
breathing during sleep that is an underappreciated
comorbidity in CHD. Clinicians should
suspect sleep apnea when there are signs of
persistent nightly snoring, bed partner complaints
or descriptions of choking/gasping/
cessation of breathing, and/or chronic fatigue
("excessive daytime sleepiness"). Patients
may also manifest subtle signs of cognitive
dysfunction or mood symptoms. Suspected
apnea should result in referral for evaluation
to a sleep center. It is not clear whether treatment
of sleep apnea lowers the risk of
MI/death, but this seems likely to be the case
(Ketterer, Brymer, Rhoads, Kraft, &amp; Kenyon,
1994). Because many apneics develop a reactive
depression due to self-attributions regarding
their "laziness," treatment of sleep apnea
can improve mood (Dahlof, Ejnell, Hallstrom,
&amp; Hdner, 2000).


<b>
<i>Cognitive Dysfunction</i>
</b>


Of particular importance in this population,
particularly given advanced age, are consideration
of whether the patient displays any cognitive
impairment (often subtle and in the
absence of waxing/waning arousal and attention).
The use of a cognitive screening tool or
procedure (e.g., month, year, three items
immediate and delayed, counting backward) at
initial evaluation is important. Because of the
patient's vascular disease and/or arrhythmias
(particularly those patients who have atrial
fibrillation), the likelihood of mild-moderate,
early-stage, multi-infarct dementia (often
manifesting on magnetic resonance imaging/
computerized, tomography [MRI/CT] as
"periventricular leukomalacia" or "ischemic
white matter changes") is elevated. Although
the patient may still be highly functional, irritability/
frustration over subtle memory-related
problems may be an aggravating factor if he
or she externalizes causality. Ruling out alternative,
potentially arrestable causes (e.g., a
thyroid-stimulating hormone for thyroid problems,
a venereal disease research laboratory or
a rapid plasma regain test for neurosyphilis) is
important, but such causes are only rarely
found. Patients often fear a large cerebrovascular
accident more than they fear a heart attack.
Because prophylaxis of cerebrovascular accidents
is the same as the regimen followed for
MIs, patients can be reassured that all reasonable
steps are being taken, and their concern
can be used to further motivate "taking care of
themselves."


<b>
<i>The Importance of
Collateral Clinical Data</i>
</b>


Because of the high rate of denial/minimization/
alexithymia present in this patient
population, the clinician should be somewhat
skeptical about the patient's version of his or
her life and circumstances. Although it is
important to understand how the patient
attributes meaning to events, psychological
"holes" in narration (e.g., "Gee, I don't know
why she left me") should be seen as important
and indicative of a chronic coping problem.


Significant others should always be used as
collateral sources of information when evaluating
a patient or tracking response to treatment.
Sometimes, this can be accomplished by simply
asking the patient, "How does your wife
[husband] think you are doing?" Other times, it
is necessary to obtain independent contact with
the significant other because of the patient's
denial/alexithymia or other lack of insight.
Often, it is necessary to obtain this data out of

[p. <i>291</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00301&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As an adjunct to interviewing significant
others, the Spouse/Friend Ketterer Stress
Symptom Frequency Checklist (KSSFC)
(Ketterer et al., 1996, 1998, 2002) is recommended
for obtaining a significant other's
assessments of the patient's emotional status.
The KSSFC is unique in this feature of allowing
both patient self-ratings and ratings by significant
others. The spouse/friend KSSFC can
be administered by sending it home with minimal
written instructions and a stamped
addressed envelope to "someone who knows
you well." The patient and significant other
should be encouraged to not discuss the questionnaire
until after it has been mailed, back. If
the clinician is seeking direct input from a
spouse/significant other on the patient's routine
emotional functioning, it is critical that
the conversation occur without the patient
being present. It has been demonstrated that
spouse/friend-reported depression using the
KSSFC is a stronger correlate of coronary
artery disease severity (by angiography) than
is self-report and that denial of depression
(spouse/friend minus self-ratings) is an even
stronger correlate (Ketterer et al., 1996).
Furthermore, spouse/friend ratings (and not
self-ratings) of anxiety were the only predictor
of angina at 5-year follow-up, and it was
shown that denial of distress (particularly
AIAI) is a very strong predictor of mortality
(Ketterer et al., 1998). For this reason, the
chapter authors routinely send their male
patients home with a questionnaire about
themselves to be given to "someone who
knows you well" to complete and return
independently by mail <i>before</i> discussions with
the patients. Although not yet documented, it
will be interesting to see whether this relationship
holds true for female patient/male significant
other dyads.

<b>Treatment and Clinical Practice</b>

<b>
<i>Stress and Coping Framework</i>
</b>


Stress is a concept that most people, including
those with CHD, readily accept and for
which they have some intuitive understanding.
Framing any psychological or behavioral problems
within a diathesis stress model rather than
using more traditional or formal psychiatric
nomenclature (e.g., "crankiness" rather than
"anger," feeling "down" rather than feeling
"depressed," "worried." or "stressed" rather
than "anxious") will typically provoke the
least resistance and help to facilitate a therapeutic
alliance. Clinicians working within a
traditional psychiatric context and looking to
develop cardiac referrals will face resistance
from patients even before their first visits.
Ideally, treatment should be done as part of a
multidisciplinary cardiac team or consultation
service rather than removed in a separate psychiatric
setting to maximize destigmatization.
Table 15.5 summarizes some of the treatment
studies focusing on stress reduction.


Here the transactional model of Lazarus
and Folkman (1984) works nicely. In the most
general sense, coping efforts can be presented
to patients as taking one of two tacks: problem-focused
coping or emotion-focused coping.
For heuristic purposes, these two coping
efforts can be discussed as if they are separate,
independent coping methods, whereas in vivo
they most often interact in dynamic fashion
and over time the patient will need to integrate
them more effectively. Problem-focused coping,
or efforts aimed at defining the problem,

[p. <i>292</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00302&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I026&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Reliance on problem-focused coping strategies
often comes at the expense of good, constructive,
emotion-focused coping skills. Issues
such as poor self-pacing, inability to relax or
tolerate "downtime," and substance use are
indicative of poor emotion-focused coping.


It is usually useful to teach some form of
relaxation to new patients. Acute reductions in
heart rate and blood pressure, and the subjective
benefits (e.g., calming, reduced worry,
reduced chest pain, reduced headache, easier
sleep onset) that accompany these exercises,
provide an immediately perceived sense of control
over previously "uncontrollable" events
and so reinforce instructions regarding stress
and CHD. The chapter authors use such a procedure
prior to all group sessions because it
also seems to foster psychological mindedness,
permitting possible alteration of pathogenic
cognitive attributions. Helping patients to master
abbreviated relaxation methods, such as a

[p. <i>293</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00303&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The core goal of stress management in coronary
artery disease patients is to reduce the
frequency/intensity/duration (or "density") of
emotional distress (or "stress"). The clinician
should consider whether the patient's psychosocial
environment is unusually stressful
(i.e., triggers) and should, identify one chronic
stressor (or a few) and use ongoing life events
to alter habitual cognitions/behaviors ("coping").
An alcoholic spouse, a demanding or
abusive boss, and kids who are abusing drugs
and sponging off the patient all require a different
nexus of the intervention. For example,
the chapter authors have seen a half dozen
cases where getting an angry spouse on an
SSRI resolved a patient's chest pain.


Frequently recurring stressors that lead to
problematic emotions/behaviors should be
identified and reviewed at each session to see
whether the patient is attempting suggested
alternatives and whether the alternatives are
"working" (i.e., reducing the density of emotional
distress). By attacking the largest stressors
first, the patient is most likely to succeed
at having a big effect quickly. The only exception
to this strategy is when the patient is
too overwhelmed (fearful) of attempting an
alternative response or when response-specific
skills deficits are present and require time to
remediate. For example, the patient might not
know how to behave assertively and/or might
not be able to appropriately discriminate
between assertive and aggressive behaviors.
For such a patient, time must be spent reviewing
events and teaching and even role-playing
skills until the patient begins to perceive the
unavoidability of facing the "dragon" (usually
a boss, parent, child, or spouse) and has
attained adequate skills. If such attempts are
unsuccessful, consideration should be given
to involving the dragon in treatment.


The clinician should assess and begin to
challenge self/other perceptions ("I'm/He's
the kind of person who ..."). Many cardiac
patients, while readily labeling others, seem to
have lived unexamined lives. This means that
the uniqueness (and maladaptiveness) of one's
own personality often is not part of the way in
which the patient attributes meaning to events.
Once the clinician has a firm grasp on the
patient's habitual ways of thinking/responding,
it is critical to find a positive (or humorous) or
pragmatic way in which to frame this trait.
Thus, an obsessional person can be described
as "thorough" or "careful," or he or she can
be described as "picky." The former will generally
be received by the patient as a positive
trait (perhaps carried too far at times), whereas
the latter will evoke defensiveness. Once rapport
is established, teasing/humor can be a
powerful tool for getting the patient to cast
himself or herself in a new light and for diffusing
angry or resentful emotional responses.
The locus of the problem then is no longer
"out there" but at least partly "in here." Well-written
readings (generally full of stories/cases)
on topics such as Type A behavior (Friedman
&amp; Ulmer, 1984), assertiveness (Alberti &amp;
Emmons, 1975), panic attacks (Sheehan,
1983), and nurturant communication
(Gordon, 1970) can be helpful in getting the
patient to think about his or her life, beliefs,
and behavior. Without such rich biographical
examples, the patient tends to restrict his or her
perspective (e.g., "I'm right, dammit, and that
SOB is going to admit it") so as to win the
battle while losing the war. The clinician who
can bring a rich body of personal, historical, or
clinical vignettes to bear will teach the patient
more quickly than will the clinician who deals
only in abstractions (Friedman, 1979).


It is important to review weekly/monthly
stressful events with the patient to ascertain
frequency of stressors, the cognitive/behavioral
response of the patient, whether a suggested
alternative response was tried, and the success/
failure of the response as well as to encourage
alteration of future events. It is common for
patients to not recognize that a "new" event is
in fact the same as, or at least similar to, a

[p. <i>294</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00304&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Optimizing Self-Management:
Using a Family Practice Model</i>
</b>


The goal of the therapist is generally to make
himself or herself obsolete as soon as possible,
although the idea of a "cure" in any psychotherapeutic
relationship is untenable (Hoyt,
1995). The chapter authors find the family
practice model (Hoyt, 1995; Morrill, 1978)
attractive for the CHD patient. In this light, they
find it helpful to think of themselves as
"coaches" rather than as "doctors" or "therapists"
who serve as periodic resources for reality
testing and problem solving. Although the initial
stages of therapy may follow a more traditional
pathway, the course of treatment is best conceived
of as intermittent but longitudinal, with
the ultimate treatment goal of assisting the
patient in fitting disease self-management into
the unique circumstances of his or her own life.


Treatment episodes evolve into "tune-up" or
"booster" sessions that reinforce skills already
acquired or focus narrowly, in a problem-solving
manner, on current stressors with which the
patient is stuck. The therapy should also secondarily
serve to support and reinforce adherence
to secondary prevention efforts given that long-term
adherence rates in cardiac rehabilitation
are generally poor (Burke, Dunbar-Jacobs, &amp;
Hill, 1997). This is an often neglected aspect of
the coaching role. It is critical to recognize,
accept, and work within the patient's cognitive,
emotional, behavioral, intellectual, fiscal, and
life structure limitations so as to help him or her
reengineer a healthier lifestyle. One issue in particular
pertains to helping the patient to distinguish
between a lapse (i.e., momentary slip in
behavior) and a relapse (return to baseline level
of the problem behavior). It is not uncommon
for patients to have lapses, and these should be
normalized for the patient. The intent here is to
circumvent the patient from allowing lapses to
evolve into relapses (e.g., "Well, I already
smoked two cigarettes, so I might as well smoke
the whole pack").


<b>
<i>Psychopharmacology</i>
</b>


Behavioral clinicians are often less familiar
with the types of medications used in treating
cardiac diseases. Thus, Table 15.6 provides a
list of the classifications of the most common
medications along with a summary of the functions
associated with each medication type.
Importantly, patients can develop tolerance to
these drugs, rendering them less effective over
time with frequent use.


The advent of the newer antianxiety/
antidepressive agents (mostly serotonin and
noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors but also atypicals
such as Buspar and Wellbutrin) has revolutionized
psychopharmacotherapy in CHD
patients. Although these new agents are no
more effective at treating anxiety/depression
than are the older agents, the older agents
(tricyclic or heterocyclic antidepressants) have
anticholinergic properties (e.g., dry mouth,
blurry vision, orthostatic hypotension) that

[p. <i>295</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00305&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I027&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The use of SSRIs in the treatment of stress
among CHD patients requires thorough initial
instructions, careful monitoring of side effects,
comparatively low dosing, and consideration
of possible drug-drug complications. Doses
typically used in this population are at or
below the generally recognized therapeutic
range in psychiatric patients. Thus, 10 to 20
milligrams of Celexa or 25 to 50 milligrams of
Zoloft is adequate for perhaps 90% of this
population. Because the delay in onset is slow
and variable, the adage "start low, go slow" is
advisable. Many patients will stop the medication
if no change is observed during the first
few days unless the importance of at least a
1-month trial is emphasized repeatedly. With
some SSRIs (e.g., Paxil, Remeron), there often
is an immediate soporific effect, and these
should initially be tried at night. Otherwise, the
medications are taken in the morning to avoid
interfering with sleep and with food, to minimize
gastrointestinal distress (i.e., abdominal
cramping or diarrhea). Most of the improvements
will "sneak up" on patients over 10 days
to 6 weeks. Indeed, it is common for patients
to say "I don't feel any different" but for
family members and/or coworkers to notice a
change in the patients. Prepping patients about
the subtle effects of these medications can go a
long way toward circumventing unrealistic

[p. <i>296</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00306&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Common side effects within 24 to 48 hours
of starting therapy include diarrhea/ abdominal
cramping (about 10% of patients). Half of
those experiencing diarrhea/abdominal
cramping are only mildly affected, and it
should resolve within 10 days. The remainder
must be tried on other agents. Headache
occurs in about 3% of patients and generally
resolves within 10 days. In addition, intense
anxiety occurs in about 1% of patients. Over
several weeks, about one quarter of patients
develop loss of libido or erectile problems.
Alternative agents, or referral to a psychiatrist
for additional agents, should be considered.
Some weight gain (7 to 10 pounds) may occur.


The chapter authors have observed several
adverse effects of SSRIs that are unique to this
population. Some patients, usually with a
history of prior atrial fibrillation, may develop
<i>worsened</i> atrial fibrillation on SSRIs. The
authors believe that consultation with a psychiatrist
is necessary to select a safe and effective
agent (e.g., Buspar, Wellbutrin). Likewise,
because of the effect of some SSRIs on
cytochrome P450 metabolic pathways in the
liver, some drugs will be removed from the
bloodstream more slowly, thereby raising
bioavailability. Management can include
reduced dosing of the affected agent or use of
another SSRI that is less likely to have this
effect. Celexa and Zoloft are minimally likely
to interfere with other medications and so are
generally first-choice agents. Among the medications
potentially affected in cardiac patients
are digoxin and beta blockers. <i>Digoxin toxicity</i>
can result in confusion/cognitive impairment,
loss of appetite, and a resting tremor.
<i>Potentiation of beta blockers</i> by use of an
SSRI can result in lowered heart rate and
blood pressure. Clinically, patients will
complain of worsened fatigue or tiredness,
dizziness, or light-headedness. Because of the
effects on the liver, <i>hepatic strain</i> will sometimes
result from use of an SSRI. This is most
common in patients with prior liver injury
(e.g., history of alcohol abuse or hepatitis) or
in patients receiving other hepatically difficult
medications (e.g., lipid-lowering agents). In
severe enough cases, weakness, nausea, and
loss of appetite will indicate low-level hepatic
failure and should result in immediate cessation
of the drug until liver function tests can be
obtained. Some SSRIs may be less likely to
have this effect.


Many patients will resist referral to a psychiatrist
but will accept these agents from a
cardiologist or a primary care physician. If one
is attempting a first trial, working with the cardiologist/
primary care physician may be adequate.
But if special circumstances occur (e.g.,
nonresponse, intolerance of two agents, multiple
or problematic side effects such as sexual
dysfunction, need for larger doses, recent
history of substance abuse, propensity for somatization),
referral to a psychiatrist should
become a goal of psychological treatment.


Another option may be to use the herbal St.
John's wort, which is widely used in Europe
for the treatment of depression. Several dozen
randomized clinical trials on St. John's wort
have demonstrated an effectiveness equivalent
to that of TCAs (and therefore presumably
SSRIs) but with fewer side effects than TCAs
(Linde &amp; Mulrow, 1999), although other
reports have called these data into question.
Preparations by reputable manufacturers (e.g.,
Centrum, Quanterra) should be used because
smaller sources have not carefully standardized
source or dose given that these supplements are
not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Because St. John's wort is not
viewed as "artificial" or a "psychiatric medication,"
patients will sometimes try it (or even
insist on it) rather than the better understood

[p. <i>298</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00308&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The chapter authors have not yet found it
necessary to refer a patient for electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT). But if a patient presents
an otherwise intractable depression, special
considerations are necessary. Heart failure,
aneurysm, and arrythmias are considered
contraindications to ECT.

<b>Summary and Conclusions</b>

There is mounting evidence that psychological
and behavioral factors play an independent and
critical role in the development, maintenance,
and. exacerbation of CHD. The clinical behavioral
sciences, including health psychologists of
all stripes, have played a significant role in
moving this scientific literature forward. More
recent trends have allowed for practitioners to
play more central roles in clinical settings such
as Phase II cardiac rehabilitation and consultation
services targeting cardiology patients.
These trends are likely to continue, thereby
allowing greater and more varied practice
opportunities with this patient population.
This chapter has attempted to provide an experienced
and practical set of recommendations
for working clinically with the CHD patient.
There is a continued need for more practice-based
writing in this arena that combines evidence-based
literature with clinical experience.
In addition, novel methods of integration into
service delivery behavioral interventions must
be explored for all manner of secondary prevention
targets (Trask et al., 2002).

<b>Case Study</b>

The case of "Harriet R." is a useful one that illustrates many of the psychological
aspects of CHD. Harriet was a 46-year-old, white, married mother of three children
who was referred for stress management by her cardiologist after she had experienced
an MI 6 months earlier. No risk factors were detected other than her constant stress.


Harriet lived with constant tension over avoiding confronting her sometimes
outspoken and opinionated husband. One of the early examples of tension was
that her husband frequently "forgot" to do things he was supposed to do, and
Harriet was resentful that she had to remind her husband to do things and was
often criticized by him for her constant reminding (which he described as "nagging").
For example, she reported that she always had to remind him to take his
hymnal to choir practice. Not only did she feel angry over always having to remind
him, but she frequently experienced chest pain when thinking about these interactions.
Harriet's husband seemed quite concerned but was not able to empathize
with her. Rather, he too would get angry when she reminded him to do things.


Following suggestions from the therapist, Harriet agreed to "deliberately not
remind" her husband for a week. He "spontaneously" began remembering things
himself, and it became apparent to Harriet that her worry/resentment was totally
wasted energy. Not only did it seem that she did not need to remind her husband so
often, but the number of negative interactions that the couple experienced went down
and the frequency with which Harriet experienced angina was greatly reduced.


At this point, discussions with Harriet's therapist shifted her concerns to the belief
that her daughter might be gay and that her husband would ban the daughter from
the family if he found out. Like her experiences with "reminding her husband,"
whenever she began to worry about her daughter's sexual orientation, Harriet experienced
frequent angina. After reviewing why Harriet thought her daughter was gay,
the therapist agreed that it was likely and encouraged her to discuss this with her
daughter. Pointing out that Harriet had previously sold her husband short, the therapist
coached the patient on how to approach the topic with her husband. He
responded with surprise and disappointment, but after pondering the possibility for
a few days, he stated that he would still love her and want her in the family.


These experiences helped Harriet learn that much of her concern and worry were
generated by her own expectations and that her perceived negative outcomes were
not always as predictable as she had once believed. Over the course of treatment,
Harriet became better at recognizing the role of her beliefs and expectations in her
stress levels, and she was able to greatly reduce the frequency with which she became
angry at others. This resulted in remarkable reductions in the frequency and severity
of her angina. Harriet reported to her therapist that when she would begin to feel
any anger, she could quickly assess the potential "validity" of what was making her
angry, and most of the time the anger went away immediately when she realized that
the situation was not as negative as she had initially thought.
