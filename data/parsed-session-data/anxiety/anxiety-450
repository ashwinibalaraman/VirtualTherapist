BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so, I'm just going to write your name right above.
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, okay so you think, what did we do to you with the Xanax? Made you less anxious? 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah they still, I'm still having panic attacks every single morning I wake up. 
<b>DR:</b> Geez.
<b>PT:</b> Having a panic attack and then like last night, this is a good example. I worked out in the yard, everything was wonderful I was doing good, I got into the jacuzzi to calm down come in and had four in a row.
<b>DR:</b> What time?
<b>PT:</b> Nine thirty.
<b>DR:</b> At night?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and then first, seven o'clock in the morning every morning, I have another one.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, but not during the day and not in the middle of the night?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You're taking it twice a day?
<b>PT:</b> Three times a day, but you know I think-
<b>DR:</b> Wait, the Xanax?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm taking it once in the morning, and two at night. Just taking three pills, yeah, three pills.
<b>DR:</b> The extended release?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> What did I give you, half a milligram or one milligram?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I didn't bring it today. So I think it's making me not eat, you know I, I've lost ten pounds...
CG: She hasn't ate, since she can't eat anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but were you eating, when did I put you on this, last week? 
<b>PT:</b> No, months ago.
CG: You put [NAME OTHER] on... 
<b>DR:</b> No, no the...
CG: Xanax, before you came to the store.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No, not the, didn't I just give you different...?
<b>PT:</b> You gave me Lexapro.
CG: Lexapro the other day.
<b>DR:</b> I put you on the extended release Xanax...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah
<b>DR:</b> The XR?
CG: Yeah
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No?
CG: He's right. He put you on the extended release when we were here Thursday-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's yeah, that's what I thought.
CG: Which she was already on.
<b>DR:</b> No, on regular...
CG: Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right, but what, what dose was it?
CG: What is that .50? 
<b>PT:</b> What?
<b>DR:</b> Well, the, the...
CG: They way they do it, they, it's in a generic, it's like it says, the first...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, Alprazolam.
CG: Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right, um, all right.
CG: I think it's a .50 on it?
<b>DR:</b> Is that the XR, the ex-?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> The extended release?
CG: Extended release.
<b>DR:</b> And you take, and it says to take one in the morning, and two at night?
<b>PT:</b> Mm-hmm.
CG: Well, you said for her to take two at night if she woke up during the night. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
CG: She's to take another one and she could take one in the AM if...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
CG: The...
<b>DR:</b> So-
<b>PT:</b> You know on the bottle it says take one in the morning and two at night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so and that's what you're doing?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now, so you wake at seven in the morning with panic. And then you take it right, in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I take it in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> And the panic goes away?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes and it takes about an hour for it, I can calm myself down. I feel mornings are horrible for me. I mean they are just horrible. I mean, just all the time, I wake up, my first one I had though, was at seven in the morning. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm, but then you're okay during the day? More or less.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes, now today, yesterday and today I was okay because I was working on the yard and tired because I haven't eat...
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> In a month. But I sometimes when I'm at work I'll feel like I was out there, I almost start to feel real hot. You know like I was gonna have something going on, but it didn't go that far. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, all right, all right but before, let's see, all right, hold on one second. All right.
<b>PT:</b> I have something to ask you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You put me on the Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> Does that control obsessive thinking?
<b>DR:</b> Eventually. 
<b>PT:</b> Because I knew Prozac does, I didn't know- 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I dwell, I dwell on this, scared to death I'm having another one all the time. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but that's different because you have been having another one all the time and, and it's, it's, you're preoccupied with that or else there would be something wrong with you. 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I mean really wrong because... 
<b>PT:</b> I wouldn't worry about it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's like you, you do, you know you're, it has to be pretty um, unintelligent to not be petrified that you're gonna have another one because you do have other ones. Over and over and over-
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So, all right, any ways so basically like, they start again in the evening...
<b>PT:</b> Yes, and then at seven in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> What time in the evening?
<b>PT:</b> About 9:30.
<b>DR:</b> What time do you take, what time do you take the second one, the Xanax?
<b>PT:</b> Well I try to [INAUDIBLE] what I've been doing is taking one about eight o'clock and then at ten o'clock because I split them up because I'm making them last longer. 
<b>DR:</b> Wait, you break them?
<b>PT:</b> No, no I take one pill at eight and one at nine; I mean one at ten because I wanna make sure that they last me. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, oh, oh, oh so you take one at eight and you still get panic at nine thirty?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And do they make you tired?
<b>PT:</b> The panic attacks, oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no the, medicine?
<b>PT:</b> No, well no, no, it did at first but it doesn't any more. I mean, I'm exhausted. I can't eat, I've, I'm not hungry at all and [INAUDIBLE] it's making me not eat. I got to be able to eat.
<b>DR:</b> I know but I'm thinking it maybe, but it's more likely it's just the panic and the depression. 
CG: Alprazolam or something like that?
<b>DR:</b> Alprazolam, alprazolam. All right so she's hopefully she'll get it.  
CG: Z-O-L-A-M. [INAUDIBLE]. OK, look down at the bottom and it tells you like the milligrams. Just read off what it tells you.
<b>DR:</b>  Is that it?
CG: Point five. Yeah, that's it.
<b>DR:</b> Now, does it say XR?
CG: Does it say XR on it? The side of, it says what? ER. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's fine. That's the generic then okay. 
CG: Okay. Okay, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> So, it is point five. All right, we're getting those confirmations on the phone because I don't have your chart obviously. All right so anyway, so at eight PM zero point five milligrams and not stopping the nine thirty PM attacks. All right, so how much Lexapro you on?
CG: How much does she have?
<b>DR:</b> No, how many, what are you taking what kind of... 
CG: You started her out with a quarter of a tablet.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
CG: What was it, ten milligrams?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
CG: And take the quarter for two days and then go to a half for seven days.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
CG: Okay, so she's still on the half.
<b>DR:</b> And that's not making anything worse?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't think so. I mean I'm not crying you know, normally... 
<b>DR:</b> Mmm?
<b>PT:</b> I was crying all the time. 
<b>DR:</b> You're not crying at all?
<b>PT:</b> I got a little teary eyed coming up here, but not like I had then. 
<b>DR:</b> You're sad because you're coming to see me?
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm always glad to come see you.
<b>DR:</b> I know, I know.
<b>PT:</b> Sad because I can't eat, I can't get over these, I mean.
<b>DR:</b> Some things okay, somethings better, you're not crying okay, so keep, keep in mind something got better. 
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Most things didn't, but something did. Could you have worked out in the yard last week? Two weeks ago?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. I mean that...
<b>PT:</b> Well, sunshine helps, sunshine helps...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but still you could go out there and work without freaking out, I mean, somehow I don't I don't know, like when she was in [DEIDENTIFIED] was she in any condition to work, could she have worked outside do you think?
CG: No, well, to tell you the truth, she was too spaced out. 
<b>DR:</b> Oh, but your not feeling that spaced out on this stuff?
<b>PT:</b> No, I feel shaky.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't feel spaced out. 
CG: No, no she's not near as, not like she was.  And that probably has to do with that other medication she was on.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe yeah, it could be, oh no, wait, the, what were you on?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Ativan?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I've never been on anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> Regular Xanax?
CG: Yeah she was on regular Xanax but you were also on that uh, something the other doctor put you on. 
<b>DR:</b> Ativan, Lorazepam? 
CG: Oh it's-
<b>DR:</b> Klonopin? 
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] put me on, she had picked the Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah Klonopin, okay
<b>PT:</b> And she put me on-
<b>DR:</b> So this is not making you the same as spaced out?
<b>PT:</b> Right. No, it's, no it isn't. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and sometimes you're not having panic twenty four, or twelve hours a day when you're awake. You were before.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And some days you're not now.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I have them every day. 
<b>DR:</b> But not, not all
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Day long?
<b>PT:</b> Not all day long.
<b>DR:</b> You-
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna have them. 
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm
<b>PT:</b> Like I was sitting in there I felt like I was oh, excuse me here it comes. 
<b>DR:</b> But then it didn't.
<b>PT:</b> I always get real hot, my ears, face, everything.
<b>DR:</b> Both ears?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> At the same time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I don't have panic attacks, but I get one ear hot. 
<b>PT:</b> Do you?
<b>DR:</b> So, 
<b>PT:</b> Well, I, both ears-
<b>DR:</b> Not on, not on both sides. But before, like, one ear gets hot sometimes and bright red, and the other ear doesn't and eventually it, it's like, just feels like my head's burning off and um, but its, but its different like last week, if you felt like that, you would have had one, right? I mean did you, did you ever get the feeling like you're gonna have one and didn't last week?
<b>PT:</b> Um-
<b>DR:</b> Or each time you've felt like you-
<b>PT:</b> Some times I did, sometimes I have.
<b>DR:</b> Last week as well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I do.
CG: You, it seem better this week.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
CG: Since you came here Thursday?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I haven't gotten any better with my stomach.
CG: No, her stomach right now is-
<b>PT:</b> I burn now...
<b>DR:</b> You what?
<b>PT:</b> I burn, my whole chest burns, and I just I guess from... 
CG: She's not eating anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean you can't force yourself to eat like.
<b>PT:</b> Crackers, I eat a few crackers and just nothing appeases me I feel like I'm wanna throw up when I go to eat, well like my mom fixed a big breakfast Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> Mm-hmm.
<b>PT:</b> I couldn't, normally I would have dove into that, like crazy, but I didn't, I had...
<b>DR:</b> What'd she make?
<b>PT:</b> Um, 
CG: [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Oh God. I think as things settle down I mean were you eating two weeks ago?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So it's not worse
<b>PT:</b> I haven't ate, I haven't ate since...
CG: [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> I lost about ten pounds. Even when I was in [DEIDENTIFIED] right after you gave me that medicine, is when I stopped really eating a lot.
<b>DR:</b> When you first came to see me?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, when I, one I got the Xanax, it seemed like I really, of course I know it's also a lot of stress too, I mean-
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but were you having panic when you first came to see me or no?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So I gave you the Xanax after you started the panic. 
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So I'm wondering is it the medicine or is it the panic that's wearing you out I mean you know, can you take, have you ever taken like Tums or anything? 
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah I've been taking Tums... 
<b>DR:</b> Does it help?
<b>PT:</b> My doctor's office, I went to my doctor's office and they gave me prescription for like acid reflux, all that stuff.
<b>DR:</b> AcipHex or something?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, Pri-
<b>DR:</b> Prilosec?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Does that help?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you take it...
<b>PT:</b> I still, I still just burn. 
<b>DR:</b> But you take, how many times a day is this, you take it once?
<b>PT:</b> Once.
<b>DR:</b> You taking it every day?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How many days have you been taking it, more than a week, or you just started it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right.
<b>DR:</b> If it's still not better in a couple days ask your doctor maybe you can take more, a higher dose. Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, okay, so it's called, okay, Xanax, which is Alprazolam, ER, is that what they said, ER, it was-
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> ER, okay, right now you're doing twenty five milligrams in AM twenty five milligrams at eight PM and twenty five milligrams at ten PM. Let's try, now, what do you think if you woke up and you weren't having panic attacks you might not need more in the morning. You know?
<b>PT:</b> If I wasn't having them?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if you weren't having them, like if I gave you more at night that would keep working so you woke up without the panic you could just still take one in the morning. Okay, try um, taking lets see the eight PM one doesn't, isn't enough, either. All right so if we do with these pills one in the morning, two at eight, and one at ten. Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If still panic at seven AM, do one milligram at eight PM and one milligram at ten PM. Zero point five milligrams in AM. All right so lets try this, is what you're on now, and you're gonna try taking point five in the morning, one, which is two of the point five at eight PM, and point five at ten PM. If you're still having panic at seven AM, do one milligram, which is two of those at eight PM and one milligram at ten PM. And I have you know, the zero point five milligrams in the morning. When, do you have another appointment?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> All right...
<b>PT:</b> I had one on Friday. 
<b>DR:</b> Huh? Did you make one Friday?
<b>PT:</b> I had one Friday but they didn't, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, this Friday you have one? Oh, okay, let's see if it, still there. I mean because if we do this, that's perfect like, you'll have four days to play around with this, and then we can readjust it.
CG: Now the zero point five, what is that, is that is that one milligram you're talking-
<b>DR:</b> No, that's a zero point five milligrams. Here, zero point five milligrams is one...
CG: That's confusing me.
<b>DR:</b> One pill. One milligram equals...
CG: Two pills.
<b>DR:</b> Two pills, of zero point five milligrams each, that's why I'm trying to... 
CG: Oh okay
<b>DR:</b> Write this down, but in the meantime when we figure out what's working, we can go up to a higher dose pill. You know, it comes in two milligrams, three milligrams, but then you can't break them and I don't wanna give you like three milligrams and have you be unconscious, asleep, you know? But there's, there's' its distinctly some areas are distinctly better than they were when I saw you last. 
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
CG: I agree.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you're not crying and you're actually able to function a little bit some of the time doing things. You couldn't do that before. So, I mean that's a big change in a couple of days, four days, three days? So that, that's... 
<b>PT:</b> That's when you gave me that Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and we switched you to the Xanax XR, the or ER, whatever.
<b>PT:</b> How long does it last like I was to get one in the morning how long does that last?
<b>DR:</b> Well, that's what we're finding out. When, when this first came out, theoretically it was once a day, but you know, that's twenty four hours, but it really didn't in most people. It doesn't sound like, like this dose is lasting long enough so its possible if you take two of these pills or one whole milligram, it may last more than twelve hours enough so you don't wake up with panic in the morning and you can take the one pill in the morning, and then that, that, the one pill in the morning, lasts you know, usually throughout the day but the, but for some reason, you get panic at night. So, I don't know why, but that's why we've, we're gonna play around with this, I'm gonna make a Xerox of this and we'll get checked on that, now what else are you on?
<b>PT:</b> Well, that crap from what, the other psychiatrist, Lama...
<b>DR:</b> Lamictal right?
<b>PT:</b> Lamictal
<b>DR:</b> You're on Lamictal still.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, Lamictal um, 
<b>DR:</b> They took you off. 
<b>PT:</b> You cut me off.
<b>DR:</b> Some other-
<b>PT:</b> The Klonopin.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah but the other mood, are you still on Lithium?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Two, two pills at night.
<b>DR:</b> Instead of three?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah correct.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, all right, this is really, feel like I'm you know, blind folded when I don't have your chart. So, hopefully it'll, it'll show up tomorrow or something. It may just be in the, Thursday, you know, I wonder, it may be just that they haven't filed it yet from last week. Okay, does that sound okay?
<b>PT:</b> Well, if it works.
<b>DR:</b> Well, its working, somethings working at least a little bit, you have to agree that... 
<b>PT:</b> What causes a panic attack?
<b>DR:</b> I don't know, I mean it's just its just extreme anxiety, it's one of these things that, that you may, it may be biologically based, you inherit it the tendency to, to develop these um, and something that we don't know about maybe triggers them. If some body else has the same exact thing happen to them, they might not get this, they don't have that intensity they have inherited that. But it runs, you know it runs together with anxiety sometimes its just obsessive compulsive stuff, um, so but its not clear exactly what you know what causes it.
<b>PT:</b> Like I'm even stressed out about them going home
CG: Don't cry.
<b>PT:</b> About them going home.
<b>DR:</b> When are they going home?
<b>PT:</b> A couple months.
<b>DR:</b> Huh?
CG: We don't know, we're gonna wait 'til she gets straightened out but my husband does have to go to a...
<b>DR:</b> What a doctor or-?
CG: Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Something.
CG: Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
CG: And you're a doctor. So if...
<b>DR:</b> Oh okay.
CG: If he has to then he can fly [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b> It's stupid, I mean. 
<b>DR:</b> Why, why is it stupid?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> You ever feel-
<b>PT:</b> I'm [AGE] years old.  
<b>DR:</b> But, I know and you have grand children.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I have grand kids. 
<b>DR:</b> But have you ever felt this bad in your life? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay so, why does it surprise you that you want your parents around? They're helping you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, what, you know, I mean why wouldn't you get upset if you know, that they were talking about having to go home at some point. 
<b>PT:</b> See they've always, they've lived with me for a while and they bought a house in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Mm-mm.
<b>PT:</b> So, it's just weird. I don't like it. 
CG: [INAUDIBLE] or something.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, it could have been. It could have been.
<b>DR:</b> I don't believe you're blaming your parents-
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, put the blame on some body.
<b>DR:</b> My mother told me when I when I turned thirty that I couldn't blame her anymore. I said I don't care, I'm still blaming you.
<b>PT:</b> That's great.
<b>DR:</b> All right, well let's, let's go check and we'll see how you're um, we'll see how this works out.
<b>PT:</b> What, what about uh, sleeping pills? Should I not do that if I'm taking that?
<b>DR:</b> Are you having trouble sleeping with this stuff?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I just not really but it's sometimes I do.
<b>DR:</b> Well, we're gonna be increasing the night dose of this, so that should keep you nice and... 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Asleep. Okay.
