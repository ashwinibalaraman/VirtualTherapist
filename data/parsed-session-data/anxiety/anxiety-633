<font size="4"><b>Nina</b></font>

Daydreams can come true. About five years before the magic actually
happened, I was sitting in a New York theater with my girlfriend
and another couple watching Robert Altman's <i>The Long Goodbye</i>. As
much I dug the director's style and thought the film was cool as shit,
the thing I remembered most about it after the house lights came
back up was one of its stars, Baroness Nina van Pallandt, the most
stunning, sensual, earthy-looking woman that I had ever seen.


The only thing I knew of this actress was her rashly unwarranted
guilt by association with Clifford Irving, the would-be biographer of
the then notoriously secluded Howard Hughes, which led to her
appearing on the cover of <i>Life</i> magazine in 1972. She'd been in Ibiza,
where she usually spent her summers, and happened to meet a
writer claiming to be writing a book about the most infamous
recluse of the twentieth century. At the time, both Nina and Irving
were no longer married, and they dated a few times. That's all it was.
Then Irving, this unprincipled, self-centered imposter, ruthlessly
dropped a bomb that left her emotionally distraught, while he got
fifteen minutes of ultra fame. This so-called writer claimed that Nina
had actually accompanied him to an interview in Vegas with
Hughes—which of course never took place—and then asked her to
falsely validate this lie to the press.


Nina's virtuous character would never allow her to be part of a
scam—certainly not one to authenticate an unprincipled author. Yet
a journalistic circus ensued and Nina was forced to testify in court
against her media-created and alleged "boyfriend." Her beauty and
honesty were somehow twisted by the press, so she was not only

It was a dreadful nightmare for her. For a while, this stupid ruse
made Irving some sort of momentary big shot, a <i>folk hero</i> of sorts,
while the principled Baroness van Pallandt was labeled a <i>scumbagette</i>.
The only true thing about the whole affair was that Nina was used
and manipulated and ultimately crucified, as the press sided with the
bullshit artist and got their rocks off at the expense of her decency
and exquisite nature. Nina retreated to Europe for almost a year to
care for her children while being persecuted by the tabloids.


But of course, back in that New York theater, I was still very
much in New York and very much in my head. While watching the
film, my mind wandered incessantly to the question of how I'd ever
act around a woman who looked like Nina if the inconceivable
opportunity arose.


That fantasy aside, I mean, there I was, fresh out of college, trying
to get over my father's death, figure a way out from under my newfound
poverty, up to my ass in couples' therapy with my college
sweetheart who had moved to New Jersey to leach, and in a daze
from having just started doing stand-up. I was frightened as a motherfucker
about my show business career obsession, and that I might
be exactly what a family member had called me ... "a dreamer."
Nevertheless—maybe even <i>because</i> I was so lost and unsure of
myself—I couldn't get that cool, beautiful, self-assured Danish
actress out of my head for many hours after the movie ended.


Five years later, after I had moved to Los Angeles, the ultimate
shocker happened—Nina and I not only met but fell madly in love. I
experienced almost four years of bliss with a woman who was so
loving, beautiful, and supportive that I finally felt—at least for a

We met at the Improv where I was performing, working on material
for an upcoming shot with Carson on <i>The Tonight Show</i>. I'd had a
great set, and afterwards came out from behind stage to hang at the
bar with everyone, have a few cocktails, and see what life had in
store for me, especially on the female side of things. I hadn't even
started to get a buzz on before there was a great commotion. I looked
around and, though the joint was hopping, I could see that many of
my pals all seemed to be frozen, mouths agape, inordinately amazed.
Within seconds my mouth dropped too. Holy shit! There she was!
She appeared a little too classy and out of place standing there as her
acting agent held court near the entrance to the club. I knew the
agent but, more importantly, I knew that Nina had just seen my
show. I was bursting with uncharacteristic self-reliance. I immediately
flashed back to that night in the cinema when I'd watched this
same woman on the silver screen, and became determined to make
an effort to try to meet her. I didn't even stop to think whether or
not she was already with someone; I was too dazzled by the prospect
of kismet. Downing my drink, I found myself in sort of a huddle
with my pals that gave the appearance of a circle-jerk more than
anything else. When I announced my bold plan to ask her out I was
ridiculed almost as much as the Hunchback of Notre Dame. But,
though my posture was already as bad, a libidinous little angel was
sitting on my shoulder. Somehow fueled by all the mocking, I made
my way to the baroness.


Immediately I was introduced by her agent, our eyes locked, my
heart pounded, my penis was frantic and my tongue tied. My
guardian angel was working overtime, and the agent, fortuitously,
began to work the room, leaving the two of us alone. I glanced over
just for a second to see my friends' astonished expressions, and then
Nina broke the ice.


"I laughed so much. You're very funny. Even when I didn't get it,
it was funny."


"<i>I</i> don't even get it," I probably shot back, or something to that

"Listen, Nina. Can I call you Nina?"


"I think so."


"Look ... uh ... listen ... uh ... look ... a long time ago ..."


Oh my God. I wasn't going to bury myself with the movie theater
story was I? It seemed I was but thank God I saw her agent finish her
rap and begin to head our way. I panicked into a stupidity of legendary
proportions that turned into a most productive pickup line.


"I'd love to be able to see you away from this place."


"Uh-huh."


"Oh ... and ... well, if it is cool with you, I'll give you my number
and you can call me if you're free and I'll ... treat you to a tuna
fish sandwich anywhere in town."


I was looking down when I finished the sentence and hated
myself through and through until I heard Nina's laugh.


"Sure."


I wasn't certain she'd said that, yet quickly gave her the number
to my hole-in-the-wall flat, and much to my surprise, she gave me
hers. Moments later she left and I was feeling too high even to boast.
I'd been in a zone that night on stage, and I felt as if my luck was
going to change.


For our first night together, we chose to meet midway between
her apartment and mine, in the parking lot of some store in Beverly
Hills that we knew would be closed. I got there a little late and there
she was, in a T-shirt and jeans, looking like a very tall mermaid, and,
like myself, very happy. We decided to follow each other to the
beach in Santa Monica where we walked for a few hours. We
laughed almost constantly, and I was really afraid to do anything

A few things ultimately got in the way of this dream come true
and kept it from actually becoming an enduring affair. I was almost
fourteen years younger than her; she was long divorced with children;
and somehow I never, down deep, felt capable of raising her
three young kids if we married because I felt like such a baby myself.
I had almost no money. Her marriage and eventual divorce from a
baron of course made her a <i>baroness</i>, while I, self-effacing jokester
that I am, quickly assumed the title of her <i>nothingness</i>. And I basically
came to the conclusion that however much I loved her I would feel
hamstrung in pursuing my career by additional responsibilities like a
looming marriage and sudden stepfatherhood, and I felt that I had to
bail as early and as cleanly as possible to give her a chance to find
someone with all his marbles in place, someone who might offer her
and her children a more stable future. I know it sounds like such a
cop-out, saying I left the relationship to ultimately free her up to
meet the right man, but I knew in my heart of hearts, back then,
that I really was incapable of settling into a drama-free, nurturing
instant family. I had this constant, massive urge to first establish
myself as a successful comedian, feeling that only <i>that</i> would define
me as a man, and that until that time I had no right getting in the
way of another person's journey. Although I was building a great
reputation as a comedian, I had no money to show for it and no real
monetary crystal ball to know whether I ever would. Who does? No
one. Yet I ultimately felt that I should struggle alone and not be
loved while I was agonizing over my future. This, of course, was the

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ours was about as glorious and cool and unconditional a relationship
as I could ever have dreamed of. Here was this loving, intelligent,
charitable, worldly, glamorous creature: a cover girl and cover
woman for most of her life, a famous singer for decades worldwide
(both solo and with her now deceased ex-husband), and, mainly
due to Robert Altman's consistent belief in her, also a budding film
star. Yet, perplexingly enough, she was head over heels in love with
me, a loving yet off-the-wall, frazzled twenty-nine-year-old relatively
unknown comedian (albeit with a growing, neurotic cult following)
living in a hellhole studio apartment next to a very
well-known "whorehouse motel." Go figure. She totally accepted
me, and that was somehow totally unacceptable to me and my sense
of self.


So I eventually chose to leave the relationship. But until that
time it seemed beautifully surreal. Too beautiful for me. Nina's daily
love, acceptance, and compassion cultivated the fantasy into a reality
that I ultimately couldn't feel worthy of. Our breakup was maybe
the most torturous loss I've ever had—if only because I intentionally
gave up something that was solid and good.


Nina and I did not remain real close. Our split was so painful,
almost as if two lovebirds foolishly flew away from each other, that
it was just too hard to keep any real friendship meaningful. We've
stayed in touch occasionally through the years, and I have of late
communicated with her grown children, many of whom now have
broods of their own—and finally have started some sort of a loving
communication, if only by fax, after almost a decade of silence during
which I kept away from them thinking that I would be intruding
on Nina's apparent desire for sanctuary from me. I know that it was
me who left, regardless of how I rationalized my reasons at the time
and no matter that I felt my decision was probably in Nina's best
interests—especially given that, when we parted, I was already on

One night several years ago I heard from a mutual friend that she
was in town, and yet she didn't call me except after apparently
catching my first real dramatic feature role in the movie <i>Drunks</i>. The
phone rang, but I had the answering machine on and by the time I
recognized her voice and practically dove for the receiver, she'd
already left her message and hung up. The message was: "You finally
got your role." I felt so sad that we couldn't have a discussion, since
it was clear by her not leaving her L.A. phone number that it wasn't
meant to be, and yet I quietly felt her love again. I just knew, or at
least I wanted to think, that she had the need to reach out and
express her satisfaction at the pride I must have felt in finally scoring
in a film so far afield from my stand-up persona. I was beyond grateful
that I could still feel her love for me.


The greatest thing for me in loving Nina, aside from the joy we
brought to each other, was that I actually found out at a fairly young
age that a man emotionally warped and scared of surrendering to
intimacy with a woman could change. And even though I ultimately
ran from it, I intuitively knew that it could happen again.
