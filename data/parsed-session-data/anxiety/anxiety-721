MY DEAR FRIEND,


I AM quite at a loss to relate in the order of
their occurrence, the truly frightful sufferings to
which I was subjected; nor is it either possible or
desirable I should recite the half of them. In the
course of the first year to which I have adverted, I
was disposed incessantly to talk of my feelings, and
to weary the members of my family by reiterated
complaints. I had habitually no religious feelings,
but such as were made up of the keenest anguish, on
account of the loss of all those pleasures which I had
formerly enjoyed, in exercises of public and private
devotion, and of the utter despair in which I was
involved, of obtaining the future blessedness which
is promised to all the feithful disciples of our Lord
Jesus Christ Sometimes, however, during that
period, an unusual excitement to pray would so prevail
over me, as to induce me to desire all who might
happen to be in the room where I was, in whatever
they might be engaged, to kneel while I addressed
supplications to Heaven, with an earnestness almost
frantic, for some alleviation of my intolerable anguish.
After about the period of which I write,

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212897-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I now shut myself as much as possible from the
observation of any but my own family, and for two
or three years never passed the threshold of the
street-door. I abandoned all public and social devotion,
as I could not bear it; and thought it vain
and useless for my condition, which I felt assured
was that of a lost and reprobate wretch. Not unfrequently
when called to dinner, I rushed out of
the house into the garden, because I could not dare
to implore a blessing, or express any thankfulness to
God, who had, as I believed, entirely and finally
deserted me, and had become my Almighty enemy.
Books of every description I ordered to be removed
out of my notice, and insisted on the whole of my
library being sold, at whatever loss might be incurred,
and that was considerable, as I had paid
exorbitant prices, on account of the closing of the
continent during the French war, for a large number
of them, and which were extremely depreciated by
the return of peace, which opened a free intercourse
with all parts of the world.


My reason for this procedure was, that books of
every kind, especially religious ones, and the Bible
in the greatest degree, were associated with remembrances
that I would gladly have banished for ever
from my mind. I earnestly wished I had never
learned to read or write, while at the same time I

My irritability of temper was so great, that I fully
expected, in some fit of passion, I should murder
some of the inmates of my house; and this notion
became so strong, that for about two years it was

The agitation and restlessness that affected me
were so great, that I was unable to sit down, as the
moment in which I attempted to do so brought an
increase of misery; and I was thus kept pacing up
and down my parlour from the time of getting
up until going to bed. I was so intensely wearied
by this incessant going to and fro, as frequently
to scream with anguish. In consequence of this

Through this weary, toilsome, and excruciating
period, my nights were often almost if not quite
sleepless. When endeavouring to compose myself
to rest, I was often roused to vigilance by convulsive
startings, which no sooner ceased, than the most
hideous appearances of monstrous face and shape
would pass before me, to free myself from which,
I was constrained to keep my eyes open, that the

Early in the commencement of the four years to
which I am directing attention, a suggestion was
made to me by some friend to try some game, as
chess, bagatelle, drafts, &amp;c.; At first, I rejected the
proposal with scorn; but on afterwards conceiving
a hope that, perhaps, somewhat of this kind would
enable me to sit so much as to avoid the extreme
weariness of being always on my feet, I made trial
of chess, which succeeded so far as to keep me on a
chair. Having made this discovery, I called regularly
for the chess-board as soon as I came down
stairs in the morning, and insisted that my wife or
niece (who lived with us) should play the whole day,
until it was time to retire for sleep. In this manner
I played thousands of games, sometimes varying the
employment by backgammon, &amp;c.; Some inconsiderable
degree of alleviation was thus obtained
during the day. As, however, my companions were
compelled at bedtime to withdraw, I was then left
alone for hours, as I exceedingly dreaded to go to
bed, on account of the sleeplessness and other innumerable
disquietudes which I almost invariably had
to encounter. I therefore paced up and down the
room until midnight, or later. These solitary hours
were the most afflicted I was doomed to suffer.
Sometimes I was so alarmed lest the anger of God
should suddenly fell upon me, and seal my doom,
that my limbs trembled with the agitation of my
thoughts.

It would not be difficult to enlarge this relation of
misery; but enough has been said to weary me in
the recital, and more than enough, I fear, to weary
the reader of these dreary pages; I shall, therefore,
after observing that these midnight hours were
rendered, in some degree, more easy by my finding
out that I could play backgammon without a partner,
as the game very much depends on the dice, terminate
the harrowing detail.


I must, however, remark, that every hope of
recovery was long banished from me, and I believe
from my friends: this utter prostration of hope
aggravated, as much as aggravation was possible, the
misery of my condition. Yet recovery at length,
though long despaired of, came, and through the
great mercy of God, I was rescued from “the
horrible pit, and the miry clay,” into which I had
seemed to be rapidly sinking. The manner of my
recovery I shall describe in the next letter.


I am, &amp;c.; &amp;c.;
