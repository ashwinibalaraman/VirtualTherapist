The time is very early morning. If I manage to get away
with these associations at this outrageous hour without someone
calling the management and telling them I'm disturbing their
sleep, thus quelling my attempts to pour my paranoia into typewriter
print and thus discharge it from the regions of my mind,
it will be a miracle. But I can try at least, and don't be surprised
if a phone call suddenly interrupts my progress in midstream.


If this manuscript is successful, I won't receive any of the
credit. My paranoia has already assured me of this. I will be
quietly put in the background. These notes may someday be
published but somebody else will get the credit of having written
them. At least so my paranoia believes. They will strike
out these opening remarks and substitute another author's name
for the completed series of associations. Since this is the case, I
will not even bother to tell my readers, which now number
one—namely a psychiatrist I see five times a week—who I am.
They will see another name, in all probability, eventually
inserted where mine ought to be, and he will get the credit
which he does not deserve. So, since this ms. will one day have
a fictitious name given it by some plagiarist, there is no necessity
to put a name of my own to the script. You will probably think
this is all part of my paranoia, which is what I plan to write
about, and you will be correct. But paranoia sometimes materializes
into something more than paranoia—namely, factual injustice.
Cross off the f and you have actual injustice, a better name
for the eventuality.


As I write now I have the strangest feeling of <i>déjà vu</i>. I have

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The reason I talk about such morbid things (they are all
down in black and white for you, my reader, readers, or nonexistent
public, to read if you wish to buy a copy of <i>Crime and
Punishment;</i> all the bookstores sell the book) is that it all ties in
with my paranoia. The spiders and the gun especially. The guilt
part too, a little bit.

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tonight I tried to go to sleep but I kept fantasying about
hideous spiders, huge ones—big enough to eat a human being.
I kept trying to get them out of my room by projecting them
into someone else's room. But they kept coming back to my
room. I prayed to the Virgin Mary for help and she finally
reduced them to normal size, and they scampered away, happily.
I hope they stay away, and stay their normal size, but they
might come back. Then the fight starts again. Fighting paranoic
fantasies is a full-time job. It occupies all my time. Right now
there's a huge spider over my head, waiting to devour me. I
try to imagine flame throwers burning it up. But it doesn't work.
Now I imagine that it is disappearing. But it comes right back.
Christ had a golden halo, but I guess all I'll ever have for a halo
is a black spider, which thought I do not relish. I wish someone
would help me, but no one will. These spider fantasies remind
me of the delerium tremens of alcoholics, and that is what I
cannot understand. If they are from alcohol, they are a very
delayed reaction since I have not touched a drop of alcohol in
over a month now.


So what can you do? Admit that the human being is the
world's number one masochist. That's all human beings are,
actually—masochista. All this talk of atom bombs and an industrialized
scientific society is so much nonsense. Man is a masochist.
He may repress his masochism; he may sublimate it; he may
even form a reaction formation around his masochism and tell
himself he's a sadist. But he isn't. He's a masochist. Why? Guilt
We all feel guilty before God and our fellow man; therefore
the masochism. To assuage the guilt. But the guilt is endless; it
goes on and on. And so the masochism goes on and on. Sadism
is nothing more than inverted masochism, like a woman pretending
she's a man or a man pretending he's a woman. It doesn't
work. God is the sadist, God and his angels. Man is a masochist,
man and woman. Why fight the obvious? It doesn't help to pin
God to a cross and say we've killed him. It doesn't help to pour
the power of God into the man-Christ and then destroy the
man-Christ and believe we've destroyed God. This is so much
wishful thinking and no more. It is not the reality. The reality

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But to get back to the spiders and the guns. The heavens
opened up and dropped angels on Jesus: But hell opens up over
my head and drops only vicious spiders. And the guns are pointing
in all the windows at me also. In my imagination, that is.
But imagination is a strange thing, and sometimes becomes as
real to the fearful person as reality itself.


For there is really nothing to be afraid of. God is a sadist
when we distrust him and torments us. But if we love him
enough he will lay his sadism aside and bring us peace and
comfort. We can rest assured of this. God loves a repentant
sinner, at least so they tell us; and who are we to deny scripture?
The Virgin Mary is always there, to comfort us and intercede
for us. So what have we to fear?


Only ourselves and the brutal power of our unconscious
masochism. This is all we have to fear. This and nothing else.
There is power in this unconscious masochism, power that can
destroy us more effectively than any external reality. But here
is the secret—to harness this unconscious power as the hydroelectric
dam harnesses the power of water. Keep the flood waters
in check as the efficient dam does and we are safe. We have
control of a tremendous source of power. But if we build faulty

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sadism is not the answer. Control is the answer. Sadism is
like the boomerang. It comes back and hits the man who projected
it onto his environment.


So here I sit. Me and my hostile spiders. And a few statues
of the Virgin Mary to pray for my cure. And my cigarettes.
I wonder if these paranoid fantasies might not be related to the
cigarettes I smoke. If alcohol can cause d.t.'s and hallucinations,
maybe cigarettes can too, or something similar. If I could stop
smoking I might be safe. It might all clear up. One of these
days I will. People in Hollywood are dying like flies now from
cigarette cancer. I just read about Van Johnson's case of leg
cancer yesterday. He's about tenth on this year's list.


My forehead is covered in sweat. That's what the paranoia
does, makes me sweat.


Maybe I fear spiders because I'm of a thin spidery physique
myself. Which amounts to saying maybe I fear myself. Which
agrees with my statement above that it is our own unconscious
we must conquer, not our environment. The unconscious is to
the conscious ego what the primeval forest was to the primitive
man, full of wild animals and thunderstorms and raging cataracts.
Primitive man conquered nature, to a certain extent at
least, and made nature subserve him, to a certain degree. So must
modern man conquer his own unconscious masochism; or if he
cannot conquer it he must control it; or if he cannot control it
he must sublimate it. Otherwise he is lost, as species of extinct
animals were lost in their fight for survival.


But to get back to Dostoevsky, I want to mention that he
was an epileptic and I want to talk a little about epilepsy. Epileptics
are generally people who have undergone a traumatic
experience of one kind or another. Dostoevsky was about to be
shot by a firing squad because they had discovered some of his
papers which included revolutionary sympathies. But the Tzar
spared him. Just in time. He was up against the wall with his
comrades. Blindfolded. Waiting for the final bullet. When the

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What I want to write about now though is not so much
Dostoevsky's epilepsy as the similarity between epilepsy and
electro-convulsive shock. Electro-convulsive shock therapy was
instituted as a form of treatment in cases of mental disorder
when it was discovered that epileptics did not suffer from the
psychosis that plagued others. So they tried to simulate an epileptic
fit in psychotics by means of e.s.t., in order to cure their
psychosis. On the theory that they would then behave as epileptics
did, and be freed from their disorder.


So that an epileptic fit is similar in many respects to the convulsive
trauma that a patient undergoing electro-shock therapy
experiences. Now we know that electricity exists in the nervous
system, in the brain. It is almost as if in an epileptic fit the
person gives himself a shock treatment. His system concentrates
the electricity present in his nervous system in a particular spot
and an epileptic fit results, or an electro-convulsive fit if you
wish. The motive-power is generated by the individual's own
unconscious masochism. Even as a person who has no possibility
for sexual intercourse discharges his sexual frustrations by autoeroticism,
the epileptic discharges his psychotic anxiety by a
self-induced shock treatment. But his unconscious plays the role
the hand of masturbator plays in the sexual release, not his consciousness.
So it might be more apt to compare the epileptic fit
with a wet dream, where the unconscious analogy holds.


Maybe no one will read any of this. Maybe my psychiatrist,
to whom I plan to give it, will consider it so much nonsense
and throw it away. Or perhaps even as I write a machine is
recording my every word from a room down the hallway. Both
possibilities exist—that no one will read this, and that everyone

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The paranoia is still here. It hasn't gone out of me and onto
the paper in front of me as I type as I hoped it would.


Castration anxiety. This is always a possibility. Perhaps that's
all paranoia is on an unconscious level. Castration anxiety. For
example, if I love the Virgin Mary with all my heart and soul,
as I do, I am in danger. Why? Because she rightly belongs in
matrimony only to the Holy Spirit. So who do I fear? The
Holy Spirit, obviously. I desire to possess the Virgin Mary, my
symbolical mother figure, for myself. But she is my mother
figure and therefore cannot be my wife figure. She is the wife
figure of the Holy Spirit who is my father figure. I must relinquish
her or be castrated by the Holy Spirit. That is, destroyed.
By spiders and guns and my own unconscious masochism. These
are the three weapons of the Holy Spirit and they are too
powerful for me to cope with.


Megalomania isn't the way out because megalomania is the
reverse side of the same coin. On one side of the coin we have
paranoia, on the other megalomania. The whole coin is no good
and must be discarded. If you keep the coin you will see the
side of megalomania one day and be joyful, but the next day
you will see the side of paranoia and be scared back into your
hole. One leads to the other and then back again, and so on and
so on; until we discard the coin of delusion with its two sides of
delusional grandeur and delusional persecution, and obtain for

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So it seems these associations have led us to religion. Why?
Because God represents the security of the primal father. We
all need that security. We cannot dispense with it as easily as
Freud did, because none of us has the insight or courage of
this Austrian Jew who was able to make jokes when the Germans
ransacked his house and demanded a high ranson for his
freedom, saying calmly, "I never charged a fee quite that high
for any of <i>my</i> visits."


Well, it's nearly 4 A.M. now and I've written for an hour and
a half. Time to call a halt I think. Maybe I'll write another series
of associations tomorrow evening, or rather tomorrow morning,
if I find the energy.

<b>March 8, 8 A.M.</b>

Well. Here I am. Back at the typewriter. I couldn't sleep.
The spider fantasies became too strong and kept me awake. I
didn't plan to return to my associations until tomorrow morning,
but since I couldn't sleep I thought I would again try to divert
some of my paranoia onto paper.

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Who knows. I might even run into another novel with all
these pages filled with my cathartic attempts. We'll have to
wait and see. If I do I would certainly like to obtain the prestige
of publication, but once again I don't think I will. Here I
am, six feet in height, blue eyes, etc. But what does this matter.
If they ever publish these pages they can delete all this information
and still give the credit to someone else. So I won't even
bother to complete my identification by revealing my name.
They can always strike that out of the final copy too. And as
for the physiological data, they can always find someone else to
fit the description.


So back to my fantasies. As I said above I thought some
more about the spider fantasies. Very realistic. I saw the hideous
creatures all over the place. They're looking for revenge. They
don't like the idea of my eating so many of their fellow animals
at the breakfast table, the lunch table, and the dinner table.
Killed off in the slaughterhouses and served up in the restaurants
and snack bars as delicacies. The spiders don't like it. So they're
out for revenge.


I'm not the only culprit, nor their only victim. I saw them
out in the streets this morning when I went out for a walk an
hour ago. It was nice and peaceful; the city awaking to the
fragile gold and pink and mauve of the dawn, cutting her way
through the morning smog. But nobody seemed to notice the
spiders. They were all over the place, gobbling up automobiles
for their breakfast; and for lunch they'll probably start on the
buildings. I warn you, they're getting larger and larger. The ice
age was bad enough and killed off most of our early ancestors.
But that was a long time ago, when men were little different
from the apes. But the new age is coming soon, the spider age.
Much more deadly than ice.


Much more deadly because the spiders don't obtain their
birth from natural processes, as the ice does. The spiders come
out of our own unconscious; they're born out of our own self-destructive
masochism. They're products of our own imagination.
Nothing more. But such products can be the most deadly
enemies of all

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it seems I've exhausted the spider theme. I'm sure it will
weave its way back into the manuscript later on, but I think I'll
drop it for now. The important thing isn't really the spiders,
it's what they stand for. The spider is only a symbol. An unconscious
archetype as Jung would have it. An unpleasant one at
that, one which Jung forgot to look for in his research. The
important thing then is not the spider but the unconscious masochism.
The introverted aggression. Our guilt over our lifelong
practice of incorporating animals by the process of oral assimilation
into ourselves. As a result we suffer. The incorporated
animal does not stay incorporated. It passes over from our
physiognomy into our unconscious where it changes into an
aggressive animal rather than a passive animal. A spider. Then it
attacks us, in our imaginations. It feeds on our paranoia.


And the word paranoia reminds me of some paranoic literature.
A book by Ken Kesey about the cruelties inflicted on
mental patients. The cruelties consist in lobotomy operations in
which the patient is subjected to electronic installations. The
brain of the victim is operated on and a microscopic capsule
is installed therein. This electronic capsule is susceptible to
external radio control. Thus the hospital is able to obtain control
over the behavior of the helpless mental patient. It's an interesting
theory but there are elements of paranoia in Mr. Kesey's
exposition of this theory. Whether such operations take place
or not is beside the point. They have been tried on animals and
a limited number of regressed patients, according to a magazine
article I read. But the paranoia comes in when Mr. Kesey
describes the mental patient as utterly helpless. Nobody is
utterly helpless. The assumption that anybody is utterly helpless
is always based on paranoic identification or megalomaniacal
disassociation.


One could reach a vast realm of paranoic fantasies, with Mr.
Kesey's theories as a point of departure. One could assume, for
example, that it is possible to install miniature bombs in a helpless
person's brain while he is asleep. Ready to explode by external
radio control. This is definitely possible if one reads the

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So we see now what paranoia can do. It can create spiders
out of thin air. It can convince one of microscopic bombs
hidden in the brain, set to be triggered off by any false action
on the part of the person in whose brain the bomb is hidden. It
can do all sorts of things. All sorts of horrible things. Very few
pleasant things, if any.


There are two types of anxiety. Reality anxiety and neurotic
anxiety. Many psychologists are of the opinion there is actually
only one type of anxiety. Namely, neurotic anxiety. They have
a good point. If there is certain danger, why worry about it
since there is nothing we can do to avoid it. If there is possible
danger, then why get hysterical? Anxiety will only make the
danger worse. Paranoia is an exaggerated form of neurotic
anxiety, magnified and passing the boundaries into the region of
psychosis.


Fear is often thought of as a warning signal. But perhaps this
is a mistaken viewpoint. It might be that fear is what brings
about our sufferings and that without fear there would be no
impending danger that we would find it necessary to be warned
against.

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Again I'm experiencing <i>déjà vu</i>. I've written all this before.
I know it. How long ago I'm not sure. But there are explanations
for this feeling, which try to rationalize it. I've forgotten
what these explanations are so I won't try to recall them.


Talking about implanted bombs, perhaps they can install a
miniature atomic bomb in a man's brain. It's probably possible,
though I don't know if they've done it. But think of the paranoic
possibilities of such a line of thought? Perhaps I'm a walking
atom bomb. Or perhaps you are. Or perhaps we all are. This
idea of atom bombs being connected to missiles might be a thing
of the past. Perhaps now the missiles are human beings. Communists
plant them in capitalists and capitalists plant them in
communists; each side has a radio system which will blow up the
opposing country's citizenry at the touch of a button. Think of
this thought for awhile and see how you feel. Think of it over and
over again before you go to sleep and see if you can get to sleep.
But then again, it would be better if you didn't. Or if I didn't.


Actually, it all boils down to this. The recognition of an
environment. The minute we acknowledge an environment separate
from the boundaries of our own ego, two things happen,
One good and one bad. On the good side we obtain objects for
the satisfaction of our inner libidinal instincts. On the bad side
we obtain objects for our paranoic fantasies. In the state of
infantile omnipotence in which we are born, our egos are boundless.
There is no environment, either to love or to be afraid of.
We are safe in the primal state of narcissism. Then we grow.
We mature. Our ego grows smaller and our environment grows
larger. A large environment gives us a large expanse of object
libidinousness. It also gives us a wide possibility of many
enemies.


Anyway this is enough for now. I've touched on so many
frightening possibilities I'll scare myself into complete immobility
if I continue. Enough of all this.


I just hope if I go to bed now for a few hours sleep the
spiders won't have eaten the world up before I wake up. But
I add this last thought more as a joke than as a real fantasy.

<b>March 8, 7 P.M.</b>
[p. <i>[23]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These associations are getting out of hand. Again I find
myself returning to my typewriter earlier than I'd planned to
do. I was sure I wouldn't have to return to this mechanical
paranoia discharger with its magical keys until tomorrow, but
here it is the evening of the same day and I'm back with my
finger-written associations.


I say finger-written since I allow the brain connections to
produce their words through the medium of my finger muscles
and visual symbols rather than the customary method of tongue
muscles and oral sound symbols. I don't know which is the
better method of association.


My psychiatrist was kind enough to inform me of the symbolical
meaning of my paranoid fantasies. The guns are male
symbols and the spiders are female symbols. Which means I
seem to fear both men and women. Or again, perhaps I fear onyl
myself. Only the masculinity and femininity in myself. Only
the male and female genes in my own biological makeup.


But it seems I fear my mother also. She has me in a double
bind, according to my psychiatrist. I must not indulge in a life
of oral incorporation because my mother does not wish me to
satisfy my dependency needs. Therefore I renounce alcohol,
meat, and other oral gratifications, satisfying myself with the
scant nourishment provided by cigarette tobacco. If I eat and
drink, my mother will be angry. This is all unconscious of course.
I can walk into a bar right now and drink a glass of beer without
the state police coming in and carting me off to jail. I can walk
into a bar, according to all external appearances. But it isn't
that simple. My mother is more inside me than outside me. All
children incorporate a certain part of their parents as children,
when they learn the lessons their parents force into their minds.
Do this; don't do that. We introject a whole moral code of
prohibitions as infants. We have to, to survive. Our parents

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We repress all this eventually into our unconscious. But this
does not mean we stop behaving as our mothers want us to
behave. Our mothers are there all the time, in our unconscious
minds, telling us to do this and not to do that, as they did a
long time ago when we were children. So it seems the reason I
am fifty pounds underweight and lead a deprived existence is
that my mother insists on it. She tells me I have to, or she will
punish me. I deprive myself of alcohol under the guise of moral
abstinence. This is a rationalization; actually I do not drink
alcohol because the introjected mother figure tells me I must
not. I deprive myself of meat under the guise of virtuous vegetarianism.
This is false. Actually I deprive myself of meat
because my mother is there, in my unconscious mind, telling me
I <i>cannot</i> eat meat. And so it goes.


But to get back to the double bind. My body has basic
needs. Food and oxygen. I learned all about this double bind
today in conference with my psychiatrist and it seems if I obey
my physiological needs, my mother will punish me. But if I do
not satisfy my bodily needs, I will die. So I am trapped. Trapped
by an introjected and sadistic mother figure. I can always say
to myself, "My mother is the cause of it all and she can go to
the devil for all I care," but it is not that easy. Saying it doesn't
remove her awesome presence from my unconscious mind.


So it all comes back to the unconscious masochism we talked
about earlier in this series of associations. Now we are beginning
to find the basis for this unconscious masochism. We all inherit
a little of it with our genes and biological makeup. But most of
it obtains its entrance into our unconscious during childhood.
It gets there by our conscious repression of that which is
unpleasant to us in our environment—primarily, our hostile
fathers and mothers; who are always telling us what they want
us to do, when we want to do something else. So we consciously
ignore their prohibitions as we grow older and obtain more
independence for ourselves. We think we are now free. We are

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So, it's supposed to help to understand all this. Understand
the motivation and the cure is half over. That is what the psychoanalysts?
tell us. But who are these psychoanalysts? They are
merely more mother and father figures for us to incorporate and
repress into our unconscious. More food for our unconscious
masochism. So where does it all lead? To a life of greater and
greater suffering. These same psychiatrists who wish to free us
from our dominant parents become new parent figures for us
during the process of transference. This would be O.K. if all
psychiatrists were benign persons of impeccable moral structure
who desired only to free us from our bonds. But is this the case?
No! Sometimes the cure is worse than the illness. The new
parent figure is worse than the old one. And even if the substitute
parent, the psychiatrist, is of a more benign nature than our
original dominant parent was, we can never be hopeful for a
perfect parent substitute. A certain amount of prohibition will
be present. Will be introjected. Will be incorporated into our
unconscious and converted into a sadistic superego, lashing and
masochizing our conscious ego until we beg for the mercy we
are liable never to receive.


It seems I am writing in the existential vein. Like Sartre and
Camus in their fictional creations. We are all trapped. Life is a
tragedy and we must play out our parts as actors with tragic
roles to be fulfilled and there is no exit, only a continuous fall.


Car horns are blowing out in the streets. Why do they blow?
They are fearful of the spiders. The spiders are waiting at every
corner to devour them. Automobiles are their favorite food. I
know the spiders are consuming me also, but I must not consciously
acknowledge this fact. It is too fearful.


It all seems to point to a return to the womb, if the spider is
actually a female symbol, as my psychiatrist assures me. I both
desire to return there and yet am fearful of the prospect The

And the incorporating womb is the incorporating mother
figure, who will not allow me to eat but yet desires to eat me,
body and soul, with her genital apparatus.


Supposing now we take the mathematical formula <i>a</i> is to <i>b</i>
as <i>b</i> is to <i>c</i>. Take the formula itself as correct and indisputable,
regardless of application. Then we go a step further and find
there are a million and one applications in the field of mathematics
itself. For example if <i>a</i> is 1 and <i>b</i> is 2 and <i>c</i> is 3, then the
formula reads 1 is to 2 as 2 is to 3. This is correct. But this is
not the only correct mathematical formulation of the formula.
How about 1 is to 2 as 2 is to 4. This is also correct. Or 2 is to
3 as 3 is to 4. Also correct. Or 2 is to 4 as 4 is to 8. Also correct.
Or 10 is to 5 as 5 is to 2.5. Also correct. The possibilities are
almost infinite. Expand the formula now to physics, chemistry,
and the vast variety of scientific foundations. We can not only
apply the basic formula <i>a</i> is to <i>b</i> as <i>b</i> is to <i>c</i> to a multitude of
reality situations; we can also apply the multitude of mathematical
variations of this formula to an even greater multitude of
reality situations.


What I'm getting at is this. If I eat something, then I am to
that something what that something is to something else. I eat
something and that something eats something else. This is not
only a hypothesis based on an abstract formula, it happens to be
the law of nature. The more powerful species prey on the less
powerful; the less powerful on the even less powerful; etc., etc.
Or if some angel in heaven incorporates some saint in heaven by
the process of mental incorporation, and that saint in heaven
incorporates me by the same process, we have the same formula
again, in reverse. This time I am at the bottom of the ladder of
incorporation, rather than at the top. Or you can put me in the
middle if you wish. It matters little to me. I'm only trying to
bring out a point. The point being the application of a simple
mathematical formula to real-life situations. Now it is this mathematical
formula which is the basis of all analogous logic. Analogy
always works on the principle that <i>a</i> is to <i>b</i> as <i>b</i> is to <i>c</i>.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So it goes. We see the practicality of reducing our life to
mathematical formulas. It makes everything easier. So simple to
put it all down in the little numerical and alphabetical symbols.


But if we wish to switch over to psychology again for a
while we find that there is a psychological basis for these
thoughts, as well as a mathematical one. A female psychoanalyst
in England has done research on this subject and discovered in
young children a strong desire to incorporate, through their oral
apparatus, objects and persons in their environment. But they
have a strong fear attached to their desire. They are afraid that
if they devour certain persons or things, certain other persons
or things will devour <i>them</i>.


So, to get back to me. These spiders threatening to devour
me are merely my self-retaliation fantasies. I desire to incorporate
parts of my environment, primarily in the form of nutritional
sustenance. But I am afraid that if I do I will in turn be
incorporated by someone else.


Therefore I fear the spiders. <i>Comprenez-vous?</i> They are the
something else that will consume me, if I engage in oral aggression
myself. As the little children in England fear they will in
turn be destroyed, if they destroy the objects they love by the
process of incorporation; identifying their love objects with the
food they eat, and thus destroying them in a symbolical manner.


I just realized what's going on. They're giving me a new
kind of therapy. It's called spider therapy. It's induced by the
pills I take. The tranquilizers. I eat the little white pills; then
the big black spiders eat me. Night is the biggest spider of all.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Well, enough of this. I've been eaten enough. Now it's my
turn to do some eating. My poor stomach is a ball of hard
steel, crying out for food. I will go out and eat and return to
this typewriter later. But I know already I will not eat. When
I see the food in front of me the hard steel will melt and my
hunger will vanish. The food I need will not be taken into my
system.


So be it. My unconscious mother figure is there in my
deeper mental regions, warning me, telling me not to satisfy my
hunger. I must live on pills and cigarettes and an occasional cup
of black coffee. This is all she will allow me. I see her now.
Her face is black with wrath and the expression on her visage
is as bitter as the coffee I will be drinking in a few minutes.


<i>C'est la vie</i>.

<b>March 8, 9:30 P.M.</b>

Well, I'm back again. I'm getting more associations into one
daily round of twenty-four hours than I'd ever counted on.


Something inside me drives me on. Forces me to let it all
out. Forces me to tell all. Compels me to write and write and
write. I've written half-a-dozen novels already in my lifetime.
None of them has as yet obtained the blessings of publication.
I've written I don't know how many thousands of poems and

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So, about this creative business, it's like a woman giving
birth to a child. She has to do it. The child grows within her
and she cannot keep it inside forever; it yearns for freedom and
one day makes its exit into the world, and the woman's pain is
over. Then the woman is joyful that she has brought a child
into the world. Grateful even if malevolent forces suddenly
descend and destroy her child before her very eyes. She has at
least done her duty. She has given birth. Even if her child is
killed. She is grateful even if somebody comes along and takes
her child away and calls the child his or hers, while the rightful

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so it is with the act of artistic creation. Whoever wrote
Shakespeare's plays does not particularly mind that someone else
has stolen the credit, has taken his creative children away from
him and claimed them as his. He does not mind. He has
brought the plays into the world. This is the essential matter.


Even when a writer or a painter or a musician sees his noble
efforts destroyed before his very eyes after they have taken
solidity on canvas or paper, he does not mind overly much. He
has brought the creative work into existence. This is the essential
thing. He has suffered and delivered. The birth pangs are
over. The pain is over. And so it goes.


I do not mind that nine-tenths of my poetry has met with
the fate of the ash can or the hands of plagiarists; and that I
only have a couple of hundred poems left to my name, which
I can keep with me and cherish. I do not mind, for the pain of
birth is over. They have come into the world; and this is the
essential matter; that the creative works should leave the womb
of the creator and make their entrance into the world. This is
the critical matter. Their future destruction on the ash heap or
their castration at the hands of a merciless editor or their continual
rejection by sadistic publishers or their passing over into
the hands of plagiarists to be reworded and claimed as the
work of others is not essential. At least they made it in the
important sense; they were born.


But this is not all I want to say about the act of creation.
I want to tie the paranoia in with all this. Paranoia is the creative
person's necessary marital partner. Paranoia is what stimulates
a writer to write, a painter to paint, a musician to write
music, a saint to die for the blessing of martyrdom and heavenly
beatification. Paranoia is the stimulus. It is the seed which sows
itself in the creative person's mind, bringing forth from that
mind the created product.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Free association plays a part. According to Freud, if you
read <i>Id</i> (short for <i>Interpretation of Dreams</i>), you will find that
he describes free association, or rather he quotes Schiller as
describing free association, as the method used by the creative
writer in his best works.


But what stimulates free association? Paranoia does. Fear
enters the mind and brings about the cathartic release. Fear penetrates
the creative mind's preconscious and brings the repressed
material to the surface. Then the repressed material pours itself
out in the creative act. All works of literature, art, music, sculpture,
architecture, etc., are a result of a marriage between fear
and the creator. But we can go a step further. Perhaps fear is
at the root not only of artistic creation, but also of biological
creation. This is a possibility. The rabbit, for example, is
renowned for two things: his fear and his multiplying potential.
They say "he's scared as a rabbit." Or they say "she copulates
like a rabbit." Or they say "they multiplied like rabbits." In each
case we see the common denominator of the rabbit, unifying
the concepts of fear, creation, and the eventual multiplication
which all creation yearns for. Because even the writer seeks eventually
to multiply his manuscript by the process of publication.


So we might have an interesing point here. Perhaps we can
go a step further. Perhaps the sexual union is secondary. Perhaps
the real motivation in birth is not biological but paranoid.
Perhaps the woman has a deep-seated fear concerning certain
portions of her personality which frighten her conscious ego.
She knows unconsciously that she must get rid of these unpleasant
personality components to maintain her own security. So
she does so by giving birth to a child. In the separation of the
child from the body of the mother; first in birth and then in
weaning, the mother is able to separate off from herself, those
portions of herself which she is afraid to recognize as connected
with her own ego; these portions solidify and take the shape of
a child, which the mother then spends the rest of her life trying
to place as much distance between itself and herself, due to the
paranoic motivation of compulsory disassociation, as is required
by the mother for her own security.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This would all tie in with the kleptomania bit. The creative
person actually wants his creation stolen from him. Just as the
mother actually wants her child eventually to leave. The paranoia
motivated the separation of the created from the creator.
And the paranoia motivates the eventual giving over of the
creation by the creator into other hands, into the hands of
kleptomaniacs who desire what is not theirs. So both parties are
satisfied. The paranoic is satisfied because he has performed his
creation and released his product into other hands. The kleptomaniac
is happy because he has taken what is not his. So what
is there to fuss about?


Only this. That it's all wrong somehow. And disassociation
should have its limits. And the paranoia which motivates disassociation
should have its limits. And the perversity which motivates
those who steal from others should have its limits. Both
paranoia and kleptomania are mental disorders, and they ought
to someday be brought under control. Someday we ought to
find their cure. Someday we ought to look around us and find
a healthy environment to live in, a healthy ego to lodge our
personality structures within, a healthy world to call our own.
Someday. But when?


Just think of all the perversions that paranoia alone can
motivate. I live in a hotel filled with paranoics. They are all
around me. I am not the only one. Every night I hear coarse
female laughter from a room not far away. My window faces
out on another wall, another portion of the same hotel. I can
see a dozen windows into the rooms separated by the chasm of
a small space between myself and the other rooms. From these
rooms I hear the sounds of all sorts of perversions. Sometimes
it is coarse female laughter. Sometimes it is the cracking of a
whip where a couple of people are engaging in sado-masochistic
activities. Sometimes I hear deals being made, dates being made
with prostitutes. Sometimes I hear prostitutes crying out in
protest. Sometimes they laugh in their joyful perversions. So it
goes. And all this perversion is stimulated by paranoia.


I wouldn't be surprised if it's these sado-masochists who
occupy the other hotel rooms in this monstrosity called a

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Actually, though, I know where the spiders come from.
From our own unconscious masochism. They are the avengers.
They are the introjected mother symbols, lashing us into a state
of fearful and paranoid obedience. It's terrible. The whole thing
nauseates me.


I turn on the television sometimes and identify myself with
the main actors and thereby escape into the television set for
a while. It's the only thing to do when the paranoia gets severe.
Escaping into the dreams of sleep is one solution. Escaping, by
the process of ego identification, into the television set is
another. But maybe this isn't the right solution in the long run.
Maybe all the science-fiction programs I've watched on television
have had a hand in producing all these spider symbols that
have started to haunt my conscious mind.


I was thinking about a former friend of mine a few hours
ago while I was trying another method of escape. Walking the
streets of San Francisco and looking in the automobile agencies
at all the new cars. Cars are power symbols. Identify oneself
with them and we have it made. Except that there's always the
danger of all the cars being one day devoured by the huge
spiders.


I was just thinking of Orson Welles and his Martian broadcast.
He panicked a whole city by broadcasting the forthcoming
attack of the earth by the Martians. Maybe I'll do the
same thing with this manuscript if it ever gets around. They'll
be around with guns and police cars to take me away and lock
me up. They'll consider this manuscript a bona fide document
poured out of the innocent pen of a dangerous and unbalanced
psychotic. They will not understand that it is not really I who
write this, but my unconscious, through the process of free

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So I now have another reason for remaining anonymous,
besides my fears of inevitable plagiarism.


But to return to my former friend. He and I both spent
some time together in an Eastern hospital The more I think of
it, the more I believe he is the real culprit. He used to lie on
his bed in the group room and draw hideous pictures. Pictures
of grotesque-looking swordfish and gruesome spiders. Then he
would show them to me, hoping to scare me. Needless to say
I didn't care much for the joke. This memory just came to me
a couple of hours ago, as I walked along the streets, catching
some fresh air and trying to control my paranoia.


I'll call him patient A since I don't wish to cause him any
trouble with this exposition. He was a friendly soul, for all his
mischievous attempts to scare me with his ugly drawings. He
brought me back to life after my treatments, with his friendship
and repartee. He was always laughing, and I never considered
his laughter, or the strange glint in his eye as he told me a joke
about some poor unfortunate fellow patient, as particularly dangerous,
until now. Now I begin to wonder.


He left the hospital before I did. But a strange thing happened.
Another patient whom I shall call patient B, became
friendly with me at a later date. After patient A had already
left the hospital. Now patient B entered the hospital after patient
A had already been discharged and, to my knowledge, had
never seen patient A in his lifetime. But one day while I was
walking with patient B over to the recreation center to enjoy a
cup of the hospital's bitterest coffee and talk over the various
strange matters that occupy the minds of hospital patients, I had
the opportunity of opening a conversation with patient B about
patient A; informing patient B that I had enjoyed the pleasure
of once knowing an enjoyable and mischievously-motivated
companion in the person of patient A. This was the first time,
to my knowledge, that I had talked about patient A with patient
B; and also the first time, I had any knowledge of, that patient

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So I now knew that patient A must be still around somewhere,
in the spirit if not in the body; or else patient B had
remarkable powers of mental telepathy; or else something I
knew not of could explain it all in a rational manner.


At any rate, I was stunned. So, now that I think it all over,
maybe something strange did happen. Maybe patient A actually
did leave the hospital but he left his etheric double around to
haunt the other patients and to continue its residence in a hospital
setting. Or something strange.


This would explain these spiders. Ever since I told patient A
to stop showing me his horrible pictures, he went into seclusion
somewhere and fooled us all into thinking he had left the hospital.
Then he decided drawing pictures was not enough. He
started to manufacture these hideous spiders in real life, out of
his own unconscious masochism. He's still at the hospital now,
perhaps, manufacturing these spiders and setting them loose on
the world; sending them all the way to San Francisco to terrify
me. I thought everything was all right out on the streets there,
when I went for a walk. I told patient A, as I communicated
with him in the realm of the mysterious collective unconscious,
that I had forgiven him and he gave me such an innocent smile
I was sure everything was o.k. He assured me, with a mischievous
smile, that he was only manufacturing small spiders now
and he wouldn't scare me any more. So I opened a door in my
mind and decided to let patient A out of the seclusion of the
experimental laboratory in which I had locked him, in my fantasy
life, for my own security. But I had been deceived by the

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was horrified. I rapidly slammed the door shut on the
spider and patient A, locking them back up in my imaginary
experimental laboratory. And then, to make things doubly
secure, I erected huge steel beams which I rapidly slapped up
against the door and locked into place. I vowed to myself that
I would keep patient A thus confined until he stopped deceiving
me and discontinued his manufacture of gigantic spiders
altogether.


I was sorry for having to do this, for I could hear patient A
crying from inside the laboratory, swearing to me that the only
reason he manufactured these spiders was to play a creative role
in his relationship with the world, and he merely desired that
his efforts would find their due reward and his spiders would
one day find the appreciation they deserved. But I knew I could
not forgive him, not yet at least. If I opened the door his tears
would change into laughter and he would loose some new
hideous monstrosity to unleash on the world.


Of course, all this is nonsense. Patient A really left the hospital
a long time ago. It's only my fantasy-provoking imagination
which tries to convince me he is really still in the hospital,
in the isolation of an experimental laboratory, manufacturing
huge spiders to terrify the world with.


But his crying, in my imagination's fantasy pictures, reminded
me of hearing him actually cry one day when I was acquainted
with him, during my stay in the hospital.


He was very melancholy. He wept and his usually cheerful
countenance changed into a picture of mourning for a few
minutes. When I asked him why he was crying he told me he
was going to have to live by himself when he left the hospital.
He told me his parents were very regressed. That they had both

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But the latter part of the picture story; remembering how
he went into seclusion and found a way of changing his innocent
little pictures into monstrous reality; this is all fiction and
fantasy.


It seems to me it's important to draw a line and find which
side fantasy takes place on and which side measures the boundaries
of fact. I'll try to do that in this manuscript if I find things
getting too fantastic and a little out of hand.


But if I believe you, my vacant audience, my audience of
one, my audience of two or more, or my vast audience of
kleptomaniacs and con artists, or my trusting audience of benevolent
spirits, or whoever or whatever you are who ever read
this, whether you exist or do not exist; if I believe you, my
audience, can draw the line yourself between the fact and the
fiction, I'll let you draw your own line and be your own judge.
Only in places where I believe your reason might be a little
confused, will I take the trouble to draw a strict line or demarcate
the boundaries. For the boundaries actually exist throughout the
script, but most of them I do not have to help you with; and
you can make the delineations and draw the necessary dividing
lines yourself, yourselves, or any, all, or none of you.

<b>March 8, 11 P.M.</b>
[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Down in the coffee shop adjoining my hotel, I allowed
myself to indulge in a little speculative thinking concerning
symbols and what they stand for.


I started to think of the symbol of Christianity—the Cross.


And as I thought, and sipped on a cup of black coffee, and
munched on a doughnut which was all out of shape and covered
in grease rather than the thin glaze of sugar which is supposed
to make such delicacies worth twenty-five cents in this fair city
where everything costs twice as much as it ought to and where
the good St. Francis would probably endure a fatal heart attack
if he ever paid us a visit and found out what was going on in
the metropolis blessed with his name but not his philosophy of
poverty and charity.


As I thought, and sipped the fifteen cent cup of bitter
coffee and the twenty-five cent concoction of stale bread and
oily sugar called a doughnut, I realized that the cross symbol is
a much maligned one and deserves more respect than any of us
give it.


To most of us, if not all of us, the Cross stands primarily for
suffering. To little children it means suffering also, but of a
different nature. It means they have made a mistake in one of
their answers and have not gotten the high mark they hoped for
on their examination paper.


If we produce a play on words, we find the Cross stands for
anger.


If I consider my paranoia, I always consider it as my worst
cross, my most intense form of mental suffering, my bitter
enemy. The spiders and the guns are a cross I can hardly bear.


My paranoia is an X mark on my test paper I do not like
the looks of.


But down in the coffee shop, where the little white blobs
called human beings were out in full force, filling the air with

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'll explain. Taking Christ as a philosopher for the time being
and disregarding his religious life, we find that he introduced
into the school of reason a symbol of simple but powerful value.
Why? Because the cross is the simplest possible manner of representing
schematically the elements of reality which we live with.


Take the crossbar for space and the vertical post for time.
Make the cross point in the center the individual human life.
And we have a simple but truthful picture of reality. The fact
that the cross point also represents the region of greatest suffering
to those who regard the Cross as a religious symbol, since it
concurs with the point on Christ's body in which the fatal spear
thrust was made, is for the moment to be disregarded. Though,
if we carry our analogy all the way through and draw a final
synthesis between the reality viewpoint and the religious viewpoint,
we will find that no contradictions actually exist.


The individual organic life, then, represents the cross point,
where the vertical post and the horizontal bar cross. If the
horizontal bar represents the spatial dimension (for the time
being synthesizing the three dimensions in one); we see that a
man's spatial environment extends beyond him in two directions—above
and below, north and south, east and west, or
whichever two fundamental directions one wishes to choose.


Taking the vertical bar for the time dimension, we see again
that time goes off in two directions from the individual human
life—into the past and into the future. We might designate the
meeting of the Cross with earth as the past and the portion of
the Cross which extends above the individual organism as the
future; or vice-versa; the important thing is not which is which

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If we take the Buddhist doctrine of the inevitability of suffering
as the primary component of organic life, we find how
the religious and scientific diagrams are synthesized, or meet.
If life is the mid-point on the cross, and also the region where
Christ's heart was pierced, we see the tragedy of the Incarnation.
We see why Christ had to suffer, once he had acceded to
the Father's will that he take on human form and live a human
life. It all ties in.


But perhaps I am going beyond the intellectual capacities of
my invisible readers to follow my thoughts. I care little. Perhaps
the possibilities of plagiarism are reduced if my words are
beyond the comprehension of aspiring kleptomaniacs. Most
books nowadays are so simple to read, it is almost as if they
were all written by children. This is because they all follow a
pattern. Unless a man copies this pattern in his own work, his
possibilities of publication are slim. One must conform to the
infantile pattern if success in the literary field is hoped for.


But I'm sure the simplest of readers can understand that
time is one thing and space is another. And that these two lines
cross one another at some point, when an individual human
being is born. And it is at this cross point, that the new life
stands, with space surrounding him on the one hand (designated
in the cross symbol by the cross bar) and with time surrounding
him on the other (designated in my new scientific symbol by
the perpendicular post).


So I propose that the fascination of the symbol of the Cross
for so many people, does not lie in its religious implications, but
in its implications as a symbol of objective reality. Our use of
it as a religious symbol is a typical defense in the tradition of
Freudian pathology, to deny our fascination for the phenomenon
of our organic and material existence as living and pleasure-
seeking human beings.


To a few rare individuals, perhaps, the Cross means something
more. To the saints, perhaps, who suffered true poverty,

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But to most of us it is no such thing. And we have no right
to claim otherwise. To most of us it is simply a schematic
diagram designating where we stand in relation to our spatial
and temporal environments. Though we may not even realize
it, since defense mechanisms are strong in the human mind, and
when religion is made into a defense against truth, it is the most
powerful concealer of all.


To a sincere man, religion is something holy, but to many,
it is used as a justification for actions which would be considered
as terrible crimes, if they had no cloak to cover them.


So I will leave it at that, and if some of these thoughts are
motivated by my paranoia—so be it. I will try and catch some
sleep, if the spiders will leave me alone for a couple of hours.
