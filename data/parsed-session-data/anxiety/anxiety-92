<i>The article that follows is part of the</i>
Schizophrenia Bulletin's <i>ongoing</i>
First Person Accounts <i>series. We
hope that mental health professionals—
the</i> Bulletin's <i>primary audience—will
take this opportunity to learn about the
issues and difficulties confronted by
consumers of mental health care. In
addition, we hope that these accounts
will give patients and families a better
sense of not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be anticipated by
persons with serious emotional difficulties.
We welcome other contributions
from patients, ex-patients, or family
members. Our major editorial requirement
is that such contributions be
clearly written and organized, and that
a novel or unique aspect of schizophrenia
be described, with special
emphasis on points that will be important
for professionals. Clinicians who
see articulate patients, with experiences
they believe should be shared, might
encourage these patients to submit their

Schizophrenia is a mental disease
which usually strikes in adolescence
or early adulthood. The disease is a
complex and sometimes terrifying
one in which the patient may have
paranoid delusions that people are
plotting against him, hear voices
controlling his thoughts, and act
inappropriately in social situations.
One out of every one hundred people
develops schizophrenia. I was
one of the unlucky ones.


Some say that schizophrenia is
caused by a chemical imbalance in
the brain or a difference in the
brain's structure or metabolism.
Often, symptoms are touched off
by an emotionally stressful period
in the patient's life. Like many
physical diseases, schizophrenia can
come and go. Over time, however,
chronic schizophrenic patients often
suffer progressive deterioration of
their mental processes.


I experienced my first symptoms
not long after I graduated from law
school. For many years, my treatment
was as confusing and
bewildering as the mental states I
was experiencing. My first treatments
of early drugs and shock
therapy failed miserably and, if
anything, added to my paranoia.
Then I was treated for an anxiety
condition rather than schizophrenia.
Although this helped me
keep my feelings of anxiety under
control, it did not help the isolation,
withdrawal, and paranoia I
also experienced. When I came
under treatment for schizophrenia
again, my first doctor was insensitive
and ill-informed, treating me
with talk sessions only and no drug
therapy. Today, with a combination
of drug therapy, psychological
counseling, and vocational counseling,
I am able to lead a normal
lifestyle and even share with you
my experiences in coping with this
bewildering disease.


When I left Whitman College in
the spring of 1953, I had no idea
what I would do next. I knew that I
first had to complete my military
service obligation. That summer, I
worked as chief timekeeper for the
Green Giant Canning Co. in Waitsburg,
WA, and then in August, a
few days after the end of the
Korean War, I became a draftee in
the U.S. Army.


At my preliminary duty station,
Fort Lewis, WA, I passed all mental
and physical tests and turned down
the opportunity to attend Officers
Candidates School. After that decision,
I was sent to Fort Bliss, TX,

[p. <i>702</i>]

When I was discharged from
active duty in June of 1955, I
decided to go to law school in the
Pacific Northwest. I was admitted
to the College of Law at Willamette
University in Salem, OR. After a
summer working in a box factory in
Baker, OR, my home town, I
matriculated there in the fall of
1955.


I graduated with a 2.0 grade
point average and, after taking the
bar exam, which I failed by two
points, I went to work for the State
Supreme Court as a temporary law
clerk. After I month, I was made a
permanent staff member to the
State Attorney General. It was then
that my life began to fall apart.


After my successful stint in the
military and my hard work and
graduation from law school, I was
struck down by a serious mental
disease—paranoid schizophrenia.
The Attorney General, for whom I
was working, sensed that I was
becoming increasingly disturbed.
One day, he drove me out to the
State mental hospital in Salem.
There, he and the hospital superintendent
encouraged me to become a
patient.


I had no idea what they were
talking about. I tried to drive myself
to follow my normal routine until I
broke down. I became upset and
tense, thinking that the world was
a pretty awful place and that people
were watching and talking about
me. I felt that people were trying to
get rid of me ... they wanted to
freeze me in the snow ... that the
radio programs and movies and
television programs were talking
about me. At night, I thought people
were driving around my
apartment building, honking horns,
hooting and jeering, and ridiculing
me. My speech and manner were
preoccupied and vague. Scared, I
went to my cousin's home in Portland
to find refuge. My father came
to Portland and convinced me to
commit myself to the Oregon State
Hospital for 60 days. That was the
hardest decision I have ever made.
Entering a State mental hospital is a
terrifying proposition for even the
most mentally unstable—to put
yourself in such hands when you
are already suffering terrible fear
and paranoia is an unbelievable
experience.


The hospital records stated:


The patient relates with difficulty
and is quite suspicious. He sits
tensely in the chair at the interview,
and rather rambling insists
that he does not feel that the
trouble is with him, but with the
things that have been going on
around him. He vaguely over-intellectualizes
most of the material
he discusses. Intellectually,
he seems well above average in
intelligence, but is certainly not
functioning at this level at the
present time. His memory is
unimpaired, although remembered
events are frequently
misinterpreted. His thought content
is mostly preoccupation with
ideas of persecution mixed with
vague sexual preoccupation and
feelings of guilt. He has no
insight and his judgment is
grossly impaired by his illness,
here is considerable difficulty in
abstract thoughts, and proverbs
are vaguely and inaccurately, as
well as often bizarrely,
interpreted.


<b>I was considered to be a danger to
myself and placed on a closed
ward. I underwent 13 electroshock
treatments. The shock treatments
were particularly difficult for me. I
lad to lie on a table in an old section
of the hospital while the
doctors touched electrodes to my
temples. This would knock me out.
I became so fearful of losing consciousness
that they eventually had
to wrestle me onto the table and
force me into position for the treatments.
After the electroshock
therapy, I graduated to an open
ward and then was released to my
parents to return with them to
Baker.</b>


I started seeing a doctor at the
University and a consultant at the
Department of Vocational
Rehabilitation. I was again diagnosed
as a paranoid schizophrenic,
and the new doctor sent to the
State hospital for my records. When
he received these, he applied to the
Social Security Administration and
secured disability income for me.
He told me I should not try to work
for a time. Up to that point, he was
on the right track. But in what I
now realize was a grave error, he
took me off all medications and
started me on his therapy of free
association. I would go to sessions
with him and just talk about everything
I had on my mind. He would
tell me I had a thought disorder
and then sit and listen to what I
said. That was the full extent of my
treatment.


At the same time, I began seeing
a counselor at the State Department
of Vocational Rehabilitation. The
counselor was in constant contact
with my doctor, and together they
tested me and laid the groundwork
for me to retrain myself for employment.
I was advised that I should
not work in an employment agency
because there was too much pressure
in that field for someone with
an emotional illness. Neither did
they encourage me to pursue the
field of law. Instead, I underwent
training in bookkeeping at Goodwill
Industries. The doctor and counselor

[p. <i>703</i>]

Before I began the bookkeeping
classes, I followed the counselor's
advice and became a volunteer at
the United Good Neighbors. There,
I found the work confusing and
beyond my ability. Unable to cope,
my confidence in my doctor
shaken, I was taken by my
coworkers at United Good Neighbors
to the mental health ward at
Woodland Park Hospital. After a
few days, I was taken to the VA
Hospital's psychiatric ward and
became a patient there.


My treatment at the VA Hospital
in 1974 was inconclusive because I
was only in a state of confusion,
fear, and low self-esteem, but was
not paranoid. The doctors put me
on a major tranquilizer, Haldol, and
observed my adjustment to the
drug. While I was on the psychiatric
ward, the counselor continued
to visit me and we laid plans for me
to remain a client of the Department
of Vocational Rehabilitation
when I was released from the
hospital.


The counselor suggested I go to
the St. Vincent dePaul Rehabilitation
Center for work adjustment
training in a sheltered workshop.
Not being able to find anything
else, I began to work in that organization
in 1977. There, I was
assigned various assembly jobs and
paid on a piecework basis. After a
time, I could not stomach this type
of employment and was preparing
to quit the program when someone
at St. Vincent advised me to volunteer
at one of the thrift stores. I
followed this suggestion and began
working on the floor of the main
retail salvage store.


From my first day at the thrift
store I was considered a good
worker, and soon thereafter I was
hired as a regular employee. I continued
in this work, eventually
being assigned as a clerk in the
downtown store until I quit 2 years
later.


St. Vincent dePaul had served as
a place to get some work experience
and be employed for a long enough
time to satisfy the trial period of
work under the Social Security
Administration's regulations. When
I left there, I was no longer considered
disabled and therefore was no
longer eligible to receive disability
income or help from the Department
of Rehabilitation.


With a new feeling of confidence
and independence, I began searching
for a new job. I first interviewed
with several law firms for a
position as a law clerk or legal
assistant, but I found that I did not
have the experience needed to do
that kind of work. I sent my
resume to different businesses and
answered advertisements in the
newspaper. Since I had gained
some knowledge of collections in
law school and had done some collections
work while employed by
my parents in Baker, I applied at a
collection agency and was hired in
August of 1979.


I was assigned to collect small
accounts and spent my days tracing
and telephoning debtors to try to
get them to pay their bills. I soon
tired of the work. In addition to the
lack of challenge in the work itself,
I was unable to get along with a fellow
collector in the office who kept
interfering with my work. One day,
in the winter of 1980, discouraged
with my work and dissatisfied with
my life, I became confused and
frustrated and called on an old law
school roommate for help. He
invited me to his office to talk.
When I arrived, he advised me that
he had tried to reach the VA by
telephone but could not, and was
calling around the city to various
psychiatrists to find help for me.
That resulted in my being seen by a
private doctor who, after interviewing
me, declared an emergency and
ordered me to go to the psychiatric
ward of Providence Hospital.
Another attorney friend from the
same law firm drove me through
the ice and snow to the hospital
where I was admitted in the early
evening hours. Because my medical
insurance at the collection agency
did not cover me, my tenure was
short-lived. After 2 days, I was
admitted to the psychiatric ward of
the VA Hospital in nearby Vancouver,
Washington, and my
attorney friend engaged a taxi cab
to drive me to Vancouver. I was
immediately admitted and came
under the supervision of several
doctors there.


Again, like the last time I was
admitted to the VA Hospital in
Portland, I was suffering from confusion,
frustration, and low self-esteem.
But I was not paranoid.
The doctors changed my medication
to Loxitane, a tranquilizer used in
the treatment of schizophrenia, and
observed me for several days. They
decided that I could go back to
work and they discharged me.


I returned to Portland and the
collection agency, still confused and
frustrated. After trying to cope with
the office again for a few days, I
gave up and isolated myself in my
apartment, with only a little cheese,
soup, and milk to eat for 2 weeks. I
grew quite paranoid and thought I
was starving myself to death. This
was the situation when my brother
happened to come to Portland from
eastern Washington. He found me
mentally and physically sick and,
after conferring with my cousin and
mother, took me to a VA Hospital

[p. <i>704</i>]

This time, unlike my two previous
hospitalizations, my
symptoms were schizophrenic. I
imagined that people were out to
cremate me. I thought the city of
Portland was against me. The ward
doctor experimented with the drug,
Lithium, to see if it would help.
This medication cleared up my fears
and allowed me to think clearly
again. However, its side effects
caused my hands to tremble and
other involuntary muscle movements
in my body.


After I was stabilized on the new
drug, the doctor next referred me to
a social worker in the hospital. She
took a history of my case and
advised me to move from my apartment
to a group home. With the
help of the hospital staff, I found a
group home and moved into the
new quarters upon discharge from
the hospital. Again, I became an
outpatient of the VA Mental Health
Clinic in downtown Portland. With
the stress of cooking meals and
maintaining an apartment removed,
I devoted myself full time to finding
another job in the community.


By chance one day, while I was
at the Outpatient Clinic, I met a
blind doctor who worked part time
for the VA. His manner of handling
my case was so insightful that I
asked to become a permanent
patient under him. The request was
granted and proved to be the
smartest decision I had made since
coming to Portland in 1961. This
doctor was an expert in treating
schizophrenia. He was the first doctor
to explain what schizophrenia
meant. It was, he said, an illness
that tends to make you isolate yourself,
withdraw, and have paranoid
feelings. He said it was a group of
mental disorders that basically disturb
thought and action. Its symptoms
include quick and violent temper,
loneliness, and depression.
The personality changes and
thoughts of people plotting against
you or people stealing your
thoughts may prevail. A schizophrenic
may become strongly
religious, withdrawn and isolated
from family and friends, and unable
to work or take care of himself. He
or she sometimes turns to drugs
and alcohol.


Once the doctor had explained
the illness, he told me that my former
doctor had been right to teach
me relaxation skills and prescribe
muscle relaxants because that had
kept the anxiety and fears of my
schizophrenia down. But he said
the doctor who had used the technique
of free association with me
had been punitive and detrimental
to my mental health. He said that I
had a chemical imbalance in my
brain and needed medication and
counseling to enable me to make
use of the parts of my brain not
affected by the disease.


The doctor continued me on
Navane and outlined to me the
need to establish priorities, with
socialization being first, communication
being second, and confidence
around people being third. To
accomplish these goals, I would
need to work; to have religious,
cultural, and sports interests; to
gain the support of relatives,
friends, acquaintances, and mental
health professionals; and to adopt
hobbies such as music, movies,
shows, and light reading. He told
me that if I could accomplish these
objectives, I would have good mental
health again.


I applied to the VA under the
Emergency Job Training Act and
was told that I should continue to
do volunteer work because of my
need for experience and references.
After a search which took me
through the Volunteer Bureau and
other sources, I located a volunteer
job as an intake worker with the
Volunteer Lawyer Project of the
Multnomah County Bar Association.
I worked there from the fall of
1984 until July of 1985.


While working for the Volunteer
Lawyer Project, I was encouraged
to enroll in legal assistant courses at
Portland Community College. I
took Legal Investigation Techniques
and Law Office Management. I
worked hard at those courses and
the job. In June of 1985, I completed
the course work with good
grades and a short time later quit
the intake worker's position at the
project when the director who had
hired me resigned.


When I quit the Volunteer Lawyers
Project, I had intended to
become a full-time student in Legal
Assistant studies at the community
college. Before classes were to begin
in the fall, I planned a trip to visit a
cousin in San Francisco, California.
At this time, I was assigned a new
doctor at the VA Mental Health
Clinic because my regular doctor for
the past 5 years had resigned in
order to work in private practice.
The new doctor, a psychiatrist
working full time for the VA Mental
Health Clinic, reviewed my medical
charts and determined that I might
be tried on a lower dose of Navane.


As I was looking forward to my
trip and then my studies, I had a
paranoid episode. I first began to be
anxious and fearful while I was at a
large shopping mall on the Saturday
afternoon of Labor Day
weekend. I thought people were
talking about me so I returned
quickly to my apartment. There, I
felt guilty about the way I had quit
the Volunteer Lawyers Project.

[p. <i>705</i>]

By Tuesday morning the anxieties
were no longer with me and I
reported to the officer of the day at
the Mental Health Clinic. He
reviewed the weekend's events
with me and advised me to go
ahead with the apology. Later that
day, I called the Volunteer Lawyer
Project and said I had left because I
did not feel well-received by the
other workers in the office. I also
said I was uncomfortable with the
change in leadership the office was
going through. That done, I set out
to evaluate what I had gone
through during the past 72 hours. I
knew that my mind had been
affected by this experience, but did
not realize the full importance of
this turn of events until after my
trip to San Francisco, which my
doctor had urged me to take
despite the paranoid episode I had.


When I returned from 10 days of
fun and relaxation in San Francisco,
I began Legal Assistant classes at
the community college. It was then
that I discovered my memory had
been impaired by the stress episode
I had been through over Labor Day.
Unable to concentrate or to retain
the material being taught, I had to
withdraw from classes. My doctor
ordered a CT (Computed Tomography)
scan to determine if my brain
had been affected by the breakdown.
Although the results of the
test showed my brain was normal
and that I had not suffered a
stroke, the doctor ordered a staff
clinical psychologist to give me a
series of tests to determine my state
of mind and the extent of memory
loss I was suffering from.


First, I took a test called the
MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory), which showed
that I had some depression and
anxiety, that I had a tendency to
worry and a feeling of being unable
to cope with life and that everything
was impossible. Then, I took
at the inkblot test, which confirmed
that I was a worrier and anxious in
addition to being schizophrenic.
The other tests showed my memory
was not completely gone but was
below average and not likely to
improve. It was in the lower 10th
percentile of the population. Two
other tests showed that although I
could change conceptual sets and
had a fairly good ability to switch
from one task to another, I performed
below average. Finally, the
tests showed my IQ to be above
average. The psychologist said that
although I would have a harder
time working and would be eliminated
from some jobs, he would
refer me for vocational training as a
clerk in a private concern where
stress was low and I could work at
my own pace. He thought the best
kind of work would be part time,
seasonal, or volunteer so I could
build up my confidence for another
full-time job.


My doctor, taking these findings
into consideration, changed my
Navane dosage back to its former
level. In addition, he advised me to
enter the Day Treatment Program
again. Through the Day Treatment
Program I took courses in veterans'
benefits, assertiveness training,
managing your mental illness, problem
solving, leisure education,
physical fitness, productive living,
communications, stress management,
building friendships,
cooking, and music therapy.


In January of 1987 I once again
became active as a volunteer
employment specialist with the
Urban League of Portland. At the
present time, I divide my time
between the Day Treatment Program
and the Urban League. The
courses I am participating in now at
the Day Treatment Center are problem
solving, communications,
music therapy, and brown bag
lunch. I also work weekly with a
counselor there to set goals and discuss
my moods or any problems I
might have. I report to the office
administrator at the Urban League,
doing such tasks as filing, calling
applicants and employers, writing

[p. <i>706</i>]

I feel that I have been on the
leading edge of the medical breakthroughs
in the treatment of
schizophrenia. Although I experienced
numerous setbacks and dead
ends in my mental treatment and in
my life itself, I have never been a
quitter. Luckily, I picked myself up
and kept slugging away at life
enough to find a place and a purpose
for myself in society.
