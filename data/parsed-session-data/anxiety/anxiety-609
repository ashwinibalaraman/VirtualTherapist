IT WAS JUDITH KAPLAN'S pediatrician who contacted
me about her.


"A medical phenomenon" is what he called his eleven-year-old
patient, whom he labeled a <i>superlabile diabetic</i>.


The word "labile" comes from the Latin <i>labi</i>, meaning
"prone to slip." The blood-sugar levels of superlabile diabetics
rise or fall drastically, inexplicably. Worse still, the patient
whose blood test shows the need for thirty units of insulin may
inject ten times that amount and produce no change in level.


Most physicians now believe that one key to diabetic control
is the management of stress. A kind of medical code word for
all things psychological, stress can override the body's natural
chemistry to an astonishing degree. The problem is that the
causes of stress, particularly in children, are often far less obvious
than its dangerous effects.


Judith was a case in point. According to her doctor, she was
the oldest child and only girl in a "stable, loving, truly great family
of six." In third grade, she was diagnosed with ordinary Type I

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Six months before her pediatrician phoned me, something
had gone terribly wrong, and no one knew why. It started one
evening when Mrs. Kaplan asked Judith to finish bathing her
three-year-old brother. She refused, saying she felt sick. Judith
tested her blood and realized she needed insulin. An hour later,
however, her levels had not come down, so she injected more.
When even the additional insulin produced no improvement,
her parents, close to panic, took Judith to the emergency room.


Judith received an intravenous line for hydration and more
insulin, and was stable. When the doctors quizzed her about
her regimen, she admitted she had eaten more than usual at a
friend's house and had forgotten to test herself. She was sent
home with a lecture about junk food.


Six months later during a routine check up, Dr. Shapiro became
alarmed. Judith had not had another crisis, but her numbers
now looked dangerously erratic. She also seemed depressed. He
asked if she were having problems at home or at school. <i>No</i>.
He told her that kids her age had new pressures that could throw
off diabetic control. Was she arguing with her parents? Did she
have a crush on a boy? Was she nervous about menstruation?


Judith shook her head: none of those things applied to her.
She did acknowledge "worrying a lot," but declined to elaborate.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She insisted that with more effort she could get her blood levels
back to "perfect."


Later that spring, Judith was rushed again to the emergency
room. The doctors were so shocked at her blood sugar that they
tested the insulin she was using to make sure it was still good.
Her baffled parents were sick with concern. That's when Dr.
Shapiro told them about our clinic, which specialized in the psychology
of stress sensitive diseases such as asthma, epilepsy,
and diabetes. I had been on staff for four years at that point,
and had treated a number of diabetic children. For most, the
stressors—poverty, child abuse, the absence of family—were
immediately obvious. Judith was more enigmatic. Although her
parents had balked at what they called "psychiatric involvement,"
they were, at this point, ready to try anything.


Dr. Shapiro confided to me: "I have known this kid all her
life. She tends to be studious and serious, but not like this. It
could be the illness that's causing depression, but I don't think
so. She's having nightmares, but won't tell me any content. My
guess is she would open up more to a woman. I told the family
I knew someone who would be perfect for them. They should
pull Judith out of school to see you if they need to."


The next call was from Mrs. Kaplan. I offered to meet them
that evening or the following day at noon. I asked to see not
only Judith and both parents but also her siblings for at least
the first session. "This was clinic policy, and the reason was
simple. Since the 1970s, research on children's psychosomatic
disorders has identified the family as a potential source of
stress and, also, an excellent locus for therapeutic intervention.


At my request to see the entire family, Mrs. Kaplan cleared
her throat a couple of times. She was happy to bring the other
children along if I insisted, but felt that her very busy husband
should be excused. I had already heard this objection so often

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the stroke of twelve, Pauline, the receptionist, phoned
my office.


"Rabbi Kaplan and family are here to see you, Dr. Luepnitz."


No one had said anything to me about a rabbi.


A consultation that seconds before had struck me as fairly
routine was suddenly fraught. The last time I had treated the
child of a rabbi, I had committed a serious gaffe. After walking
out to the waiting room and shaking hands with the patient and
her mother, I offered my hand to the father, who extended his
index finger and looked away. I remember to this day the confounding
power of that gesture. I had no idea what it meant, nor
how to ask about its meaning. As we proceeded back to my office,
the rabbi had walked behind me and whispered gently, "Just
so you know: Orthodox men don't shake hands with women."


I had not known. The results of that therapy were salutary:
the child got well, and the parents were pleased with the work
we did together. Nonetheless, our early sessions had remained
awkward, and I was keen to do better now with the family in
the waiting room.


I went out and shook hands with Mrs. Kaplan, a small
woman with dark circles under her gray eyes. She was stroking
Judith's hair gently. I shook hands with Judith, thin and pale
with beautiful reddish-gold braids that were coming undone.
She was holding her three year-old brother, Sam, on her lap.
Judith wore the medical emergency bracelet that diabetic kids
routinely wear, but it looked twice the size of her wrist. Her
glasses, similarly, were about to slip off her tiny nose. The word
that came to my mind was "wizened," an odd word for a child.

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I took a few steps in the direction of Rabbi Kaplan, not extending
my hand but inclining my body toward him, in a gesture
that resembled something between a Buddhist bow and a
<i>petit mal</i> seizure. A short, energetic man with light-blue eyes,
Rabbi Kaplan stood up, offered me his hand, and said a few
words to me in Hebrew.


"Excuse me, Rabbi?"


He looked at me and blinked twice.


"I'm glad you could come on short notice," I offered.


"The older boys are not here," he remarked. "They're in
school."


I lowered my gaze as we walked back to my office and noticed
that Mrs. Kaplan had a significant limp in her right leg.
Once we were settled inside, Judith said she needed to use the
bathroom, and was excused. Her father, peering at the Easter
decorations the patients had made for my desk, chose that moment
to say:


"I get the impression that you are not Jewish."


It was <i>déjà vu</i> all over again. The last time a rabbi said those
words to me in a session I had blurted out something like "I'm
sorry, but I'm actually Catholic." That would not be a hard act
to follow.


"Rabbi, it seems you were expecting a Jewish therapist."


He nodded. I informed the Kaplans that with our large and
diverse staff, it was certainly possible to match them with a different
provider, if they so desired. They turned to each other,
spoke in Yiddish, and it was again Rabbi Kaplan who ad
dressed me.


"Judith's pediatrician, who knows her well, told us you were
Jewish. Since she has never seen a psychologist, we thought it
would make her more comfortable, yes. Is it essential? No, of
course not."

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was no smiling or joking about this mistake. I suspected
the parents themselves would have been more comfortable
had I been of their faith.


I said I would be very happy to work with them, but that they
should feel free even after our first session to request a transfer.


"No," the parents said in unison.


"We will see you," said Mrs. Kaplan. She got up to pull Sam
away from the toy-box. Again I noticed the stiffness in her leg.
Judith returned, and her mother spoke to her in Yiddish. She
nodded. I was feeling excluded, but didn't want to say so. If
Judith felt uncomfortable with me, I doubted that she would
let on in front of her parents. I would ask to see her alone in
any case.


I raised a question to the family about how Dr. Shapiro had
explained the purpose of our meeting.


"Are you asking me?" said Judith.


"Why don't you start," I replied.


"Diabetes has four factors," she said, "food intake, exercise,
insulin, and stress. And since my other factors are fine, Dr.
Shapiro says I must have stress and need to talk with you to figure
it out."


"Well said, Judith," I remarked.


"And the parents are needed to give input, I take it," said
Mrs. Kaplan.


"We've found that seeing the whole family is extremely valuable
in understanding stress, yes."


I posed several questions about what they had been through
during the previous six months.


"It has been difficult and frightening, as you can imagine,"
said Mrs. Kaplan.


Sometimes families come to therapy with a theory about
what has gone wrong—a theory they may or may not have

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her mother spoke next. The doctors asked if anything catastrophic
or unusual had happened in the past six months. Mrs.
Kaplan had told them no: No one had died, or been in an accident,
thank God. She turned to her daughter.


"Judith, I must ask you again here. And please tell us exactly
what you feel. Are you unhappy at school or at home? Has a
teacher been unfair? Has anyone, God forbid, hurt you?"


"Has someone offered you drugs?" asked her father.


Judith was not irritated by these questions as some adolescents
would be. She simply said, "No."


"There was an incident about girls being rude to her in class
one day. But that's it. Maybe you should tell the doctor about
that, Judith," said her mother.


"That wasn't so major," said Judith.


I asked if she would mind telling me anyway. She said that
their teacher had asked the class to choose a movie they could
see together as a reward for finishing their tests. The other kids
wanted to see a comedy, and she had suggested something serious.
They laughed at her suggestion.


"I remember you were upset by that, Judith. If those girls
are a continuing problem for you, we need to talk about: this.
Maybe something should be done," said Mr. Kaplan.


"No way. That was just a...misunderstanding." Judith
rolled her eyes, looking for the first time typically adolescent.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I said it was often helpful to pinpoint exactly when a problem
got started. When did Judith feel she had moved from nor
mal diabetes management to a situation out of control?


"I can't really say" she replied.


"Roughly speaking," I added.


"I just don't know."


"Well, did the problem start during summer vacation last
year, or closer to Christmas?"


I stopped while everyone in the room over the age of three
reacted to my inapt choice of holidays.


"Did the problem start closer to summer or <i>winter?</i>" I
pushed on, feeling foolish.


"Somewhere in between," she said.


Rabbi Kaplan intervened at that point.


"Things got bad in October. That was the first emergency-room
visit."


"The numbers were already not good in September," said
Mrs. Kaplan.


"I would say the problem started in October." His voice had
picked up an edge.


"The emergency room visit was the fifth of September. I
am the one who calls the doctors."


They were interrupted by Judith's knocking over a bowl of
marbles on my toy shelf while reaching for a tissue. Never had
forty glass spheres created more havoc. When Judith bent
down to pick them up, her father urged her to sit back down
and answer my questions. Mrs. Kaplan shot up to grab them
away from Sam, who had embarked on a tasting, then roller
skated back to her chair on the ones under her feet. Again, no
one cracked a smile during this little drama. They were all over
whelmed by the problem at hand.

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I attempted to take some family history, but I didn't get very
far as the Kaplans clearly did not find my questions relevant to
diabetes management. I found out that they had lived in Israel
for a while, that Judith had been born there, and that they had a
fairly large extended family living in Philadelphia.


I turned to ask Judith if she had a theory about what had
caused this change in her condition. She began to cry, and so
did her little brother.


"All her brothers are worried sick," said Mrs. Kaplan. "The
fact that they're not here doesn't mean they don't care. They
care very deeply."


"I know, Mom," said Judith. "I'm just afraid of having to go
into the hospital. I would miss school, and be with kids I'm not
used to. I have promised since the <i>beginning of the year</i> that I
would help Mrs. Schwartz organize the science fair. And who
would take the groceries to the Horowitzes? I don't want to be
in the hospital. I think I'll be fine from now on."


"You have been saying that, Judith, and it's not your fault,
but you are not yet fine."


I asked if I could see Judith alone for a while. The parents
looked long at their daughter. As I always do in situations like
this, I asked them if Judith had permission to say anything she
wanted, without worrying about getting in trouble. (Kids
sometimes feel torn about "squealing" on their parents.)


"Yes, of course she does!"


As soon as Judith and I were settled in an adjacent room,
she looked more comfortable.


"What my father said to you was a Shabbat greeting, that's all.
It's OK that you're not Jewish. Our family doesn't discriminate. I
think we all felt a little upset about coming here today because
we're not used to seeing psychologists, but that's all."

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thanked her for her comments. Judith was the kind of
young person adults love: reflective, articulate, helpful.


My opening gambit was something about diabetes being a
difficult challenge in life. But self-pity was not on Judith's
agenda.


"Diabetes is no big deal, usually. It's not like having cancer
or something."


"Dr. Shapiro told me you learned to manage your blood levels
in no time."


"Thank you. My family eats kosher, so I was used to eating
carefully. Sometimes we bring our own food on trains and
things."


"The injections—"


"—aren't horrible or anything. You just change the spot on
your belly each time so you don't get sore, that's all."


Reminding her that I wouldn't repeat anything she told me
without her permission, I tried to get Judith to describe what
was bothering her. I brought up the night terrors, but she said
she didn't know what they were about. She would just wake up
cold and frightened.


"Nothing bad has happened <i>per se</i>. I just seem to worry
a lot."


"What about?"


"I don't really know."


"Your health?"


She looked slightly exasperated at my purveying of the
obvious.


"<i>That</i> we already know!" she said.


"Can you tell me more?"


"I worry about my family, I guess."


"Explain, please, Judith."

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"My parents work very, very, very hard for us. They would
do anything for us," she said, starting to cry.


"Yes, you have hard working and devoted parents, and..."


"I don't know."


"Sometimes hard working parents get irritable and they argue.
That can be upsetting to kids. What about..."


"My parents argue sometimes. And it. upsets me. But I'm
not afraid they're going to divorce or anything."


"What do you do when you are upset?"


"I try to be helpful. I play with my brothers."


I asked what it was like to have three brothers. Judith said it
was fine, but when I asked if there were anything she would
change about her life, she said it would be to have a sister.


"Someone to play and study with me."


I asked again about school and friends. This time she was
ready to elaborate.


"I love my school, and my friends are good. But I am very
religious, and a lot of the kids are very secular. They're really
into being ‘cool.’"


The "cool" kids, she said, were crazy for boys, rock stars,
and clothes. "Things that don't matter so much to me. Oh, I al
most forgot to tell you the most important thing! Miriam, who
is a college student and family friend, has moved to Chicago
and we miss her, but mostly I do because she used to tutor me
in Hebrew, just as a favor to us. She is so great, Miriam, so brilliant,
and we all love her. My brother David studies with my fa
ther at night, but I don't have anyone to study with."


"Do you ever study with your father?"


"No, because I have to help Mom with the little kids. She has
a bad leg. She had polio when she was a little girl, and she gets
tired going up and down steps."


"Do your parents know how you feel about wanting someone
to replace Miriam?"

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I think so. But right now they can't afford it, and I'm not
going to just say, ‘Hey! Give me a tutor this minute!’ You know.
it would be, like, so selfish."


At this point, she fell silent again. I tried to query her about
being selfish, but she was starting to shrug off my questions. I
asked if she would mind doing a couple of drawings for me
before we rejoined her parents.


Drawings offer clues about children's fantasies. They are
particularly useful when the problem is urgent and the thera
pist can't count on months of sessions during which those fan
tasies might unfold.


Judith seemed relieved at the prospect of doing something
besides talking. She drew carefully for the next ten minutes,
erased a lot, and handed me the pictures. I suggested we rejoin
her parents and Sam.


"Well?" said Mr. Kaplan, as though Judith and I were a jury
returning with a verdict.


I said that we had had a good conversation, and that I
wanted to continue it the following week. Reluctantly, they
made another appointment.


"Please remember, Doctor, with all due respect to you. Our
single goal is to get Judith on track again, and not to do indepth
analysis," said her father.


"To tell the truth," added Mrs. Kaplan, "we weren't sure if
this consultation involved one appointment or many."


I let them know that it was impossible to do this work in a
single hour. I guessed we would need at least five to ten sessions,
but that I would accept the goal of getting Judith's diabetic
management back on track.


"Can you give us some advice based on what you learned today?"
asked Mrs. Kaplan.


The truth was, I couldn't. There was no advice, no set of
impressions I could offer at the moment. But her request was

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Judith's medical condition has stumped her doctors, and
we know it's a serious thing. Dr. Shapiro feels this is a problem
requiring a team approach. Now I'm on Judith's team as well,
along with you and her teachers and the medical staff next
door. If Judith needs to go to the hospital again, I will be
called. If you should have questions for me before we meet
again, please phone me here or at home."


The parents nodded politely and smiled. I showed them out
and collapsed into my chair to think. It had been a tense hour
for us all. They were a captive audience, present only at the urging
of their doctor. On top of that, I was not the person they
were expecting to meet.


Everyone who seeks therapy brings a desire for and a resistance
to change—a <i>yes</i> and a <i>no</i>. The Kaplans expressed their
resistance by refusing to bring their other children, and by using
a language I didn't understand.


Their desire for help was also clear. They had shown up on
time, listened, talked, asked questions, made another appointment.
My heart went out to them as to all parents with sick kids.
The long term consequences of uncontrolled diabetes can be
catastrophic. Four hundred Americans die each day from the
disease, and tens of thousands suffer complications such as kidney
failure, blindness, and circulation problems leading to limb
amputations. The Kaplans had no way of knowing if their
daughter's medical crisis had passed, or if this were just the beginning
of a downward spiral.


According to some analysts—including the late Serge
Leclaire—the therapist must take into account his or her own
resistance. My resistance had spoken up for itself loud and
clear. Asking a Jewish child about a Christian holiday was my

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fortunately, my commitment to help far surpassed my resistance.
I admired the Kaplans for following through on the
pediatrician's instructions (not all families do), and I viewed
our differences as a chance for learning.


I liked Judith. I appreciated her thoughtfulness and her verbal
adroitness. She struck me as one of those kids who know
that something has gone emotionally haywire but genuinely do
not know why.


"I know I worry, but I don't know what about...."


Psychoanalysis takes it as a matter of course that we can
know and not know something at the same time. Whether or
not Judith was uncomfortable seeing a therapist at all, or seeing
me in particular, she had opened up more to me than to her pediatrician.
Some therapists would have chosen to do individual
therapy, working on her fears, fantasies, and behavior without
seeing the family at all. But in general, the younger the patient,
the more likely I am to do family therapy. A suicide attempt by a
seven-year-old can scarcely be comprehended or treated without
family work. Teen-agers, on the other hand, have complex
lives of their own, and many request therapy for themselves.
Because adolescents are in an in between time of life, I usually
hold some sessions with them alone and others with the family.


Judith was mature in some ways, but not in others. I looked
closely at the pictures she had drawn. Although she was verbally
precocious, her drawings were immature. She used stick figures
where most adolescents would try to sketch flesh and bones.
What caught my attention first was the house she had drawn. She
had depicted sturdy foundations and a front door with a large
door-knocker, but the windows were tiny. A small chimney

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This family plan stirred up in him [the patient] a conflict as
to whether he should remain faithful to the lady he loved in
spite of her poverty, or whether he should follow in his father's
footsteps and marry the lovely, rich, and well-connected
girl assigned to him. And he resolved this conflict,
which was, in fact, one between his love and the persisting
influence of his father's wishes, by falling ill, or, to put it
more correctly, by falling ill he avoided the task of resolving
it in real life.... The proof that this view is correct lies in
the fact that the chief result of his illness was an obstinate
incapacity for work which allowed him to postpone the
completion of his education for years.


The important contribution made by the family therapy
movement in the 1970s was one of clinical technique. Freud
treated individuals only, but family therapists invited the entire
family into the consulting room. The symptom-bearer was
called the "<i>identified</i> patient," signaling that the true patient was
the family. In early research on psychosomatic illness, family
therapists found that sick children improved when they were
separated from their family, only to return to medical crisis
when they were sent home. Researchers determined that the
children in those families were containing or absorbing the

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have seen families drop out of treatment after feeling attacked
by clinicians too eager to tell them the truth about
themselves. The question I ask myself when sitting with a family
in pain is not "What can I say?" but "What can I say <i>that can
be heard?"</i>


That afternoon I spoke with Dr. Shapiro. The Kaplans had
consented to my sharing impressions with him, and I was eager
to do so. I started with the issue of my religious background.


"You were raised <i>Catholic?</i> Now, that's weird because I could
swear you said you belonged.... I even told the Kaplans you
belonged to that ultra-reform synagogue in the suburbs. It's
too liberal for their tastes, but they said, ‘Oh, yes, good, any
Jewish therapist would be fine for Judith.’"


We had a good laugh. He had simply wanted to do everything
possible to make the parents comfortable seeking psychological

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"She's a brilliant kid, you know. I only wish my Hebrew were
as good as hers. And she loves anything to do with math and
numbers. She's what my kids would call a ‘math geek.’ When I
see her in the waiting room doing homework, I want to say, ‘Judith,
lighten up! Watch a little TV!’"


I told him that she had complained about the kids at school
being "too secular." She had always insisted to him that things
at school were perfect.


"How many eleven-year-olds even <i>know</i> the word ‘secular,’
let alone use it casually?" He laughed.


"Not many," I said.


I don't know how many eleven-year-olds use that word, but
I had. In fact, I had the same complaint about my peers at that
age. I preferred Gregorian chant to rock ‘n’ roll, and was probably
the only member of our parish below retirement age who
opposed the English Mass.


I felt reticent to disclose all this to Dr. Shapiro; we were colleagues,
not friends. It would be years before I'd tell him my
hunch: that the reason he had chosen me as "perfect" for Judith
—bypassing five therapists on our staff who shared her religious
background—was because of some better intuition. I
actually <i>was</i> more like Judith than were the other therapists. She
and I shared the knowledge of what it means to be passionately
religious in a secular, "cool-girl" world.


The family appeared on time for their next hour, and again the
older boys were left home to study. The rabbi said that they

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I do hope to see them next time," I said.


"Perhaps you could explain to us why you desire their participation,
Doctor," said the rabbi.


I made recourse to the much-used word "stress." In order to
gauge the level of stress in the family as a whole—the relevant
conflicts or pressure points—I found it helpful to see everyone
who lived in the household.


Sometimes even grandparents and nannies come to therapy, I
said. In addition, it was clearly the case that Judith's brothers
were worried about her, and they themselves might benefit from
the chance to air their worries and contribute to her healing.


Rabbi Kaplan nodded. I couldn't tell whether he was simply
indicating that my argument made sense or was persuaded to
bring the boys next time. He asked if we could discuss the
topic of stress.


"We have formed the impression, rightly or wrongly, that we
are to keep the stress level down for Judith's sake."


It was an excellent topic. Parents sometimes take the physician's
exhortation "Reduce stress!" to mean that they should
speak in whispers, spoil the sick child, or stifle all differences of
opinion. How did they think about stress, I asked, and what
had they done about it?


Judith said the most stressful thing at the moment was having
to miss study time when her brothers didn't. It was unfair. I
asked her parents to respond.


"Judith, explain please," said her mother.


Judith clammed up again.


This criticism, apparently, was new to them.

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Is fairness an important topic?" I asked. I sensed that it
was, because Judith had told me her father studied with the
boys while she did housework. I didn't have Judith's permission
to bring this up in front of her parents, however.


"If David were ill and needed many doctor's appointments,
he would be here, and you would be home studying, Judith."


The parents began speaking to each other in Yiddish.


I couldn't tell what they were saying, but the tone seemed
fairly heated. Judith started to squirm in her chair. She told
me later that she understood only half, because they talked
fast or used big words when, as now, they didn't want the kids
to understand.


As the parents spoke, I felt drawn in and, at the same time,
excluded. It was impossible not to respond to the emotional
charge between them, but I was locked out of the content.
Perhaps this is what Judith experienced on a daily basis. I had
certainly felt this way before with families, whether they were
speaking a language I understood or not. One walks a fine
line in these situations. A therapist can be both too aggressive
and too deferential in steering the conversation. When the
parents paused, I asked if they could summarize their dialogue
for me.


"My wife was saying that Judith needs some extra compassion
right now. This is fine, but to tell the truth, she has lately
had compassion <i>plus</i>. One reason I wanted to let the boys stay
home is that they have been asked to do her chores all week so
that Judith could rest. My wife has brought her breakfast in bed
every day, and she has just received promise of a new clarinet,
all—I believe—in the name of keeping down stress. You mentioned
Christmas, Dr. Luepnitz. I have asked myself all week:
‘Is this Christmas in July?’"

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At that point, Judith leaned over and whispered to me, "Do
I get to talk with you alone today?"


If I could revisit that moment with the Kaplans, I would ask
Judith to draw pictures in the other room while I talked alone
with her parents. Although the question in the air seemed
simple—"How should we lower stress?"—I sensed much
more happening between the lines. I already knew that in the
Kaplan household, women and girls did the chores while men
and boys studied. I had learned that this did not sit particularly
well with Judith. Perhaps it didn't sit well with Mrs. Kaplan, either.
Was her recent display of "compassion plus" a quiet subversion
of the family rules, or at least a way of hinting that she,
too, needed something extra? If I had sent Judith out of the
room, I might have helped them draw out these questions, and
added my two cents.


Compelled instead by Judith's request, or perhaps wary of
raising a heavily gendered topic with an Orthodox family, I
asked the parents to continue their dialogue with each other
while I worked alone with Judith. I offered to answer any questions
they had before we stopped for the day.


When we were alone, I expected Judith to be forthcoming,
but she was not. She surrendered a few words, then stared at
the pictures on the walls, blinking back tears. Could she tell me
what she was feeling? Was she bothered by the things her father
had said? Judith shrugged. She wasn't saying.


Something I often use with reticent adolescents is the game
of Squiggles, invented by Donald Winnicott. The therapist begins
the game by making a wavy line on a blank page. The child
has to finish it, make something of it, and then give it a title.
Then it's the young person's turn to draw the wavy line, and the
therapist completes and titles it. It is a projective instrument

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I explained the rules and drew a wavy line. Judith turned it
quickly into "a balloon sailing over a house." She made some
dark, jagged lines, which I turned into "lightning over a field." I
drew a squiggle that Judith used to make the profile of an old
woman. She said, "It's a grandmother crying." I asked about
her grandmother.


Judith had a great deal to say. "Bubby," her maternal grandmother,
had died nearly two years earlier. She had a wonderful
sense of humor and loved being around the kids. Judith had
been especially close to her. Bubby loved Judith's writing, and together
they would make up stories. Eventually, Judith took to
writing little books for her grandmother, and the series of
"Bubby stories" now numbered seven volumes. This beloved
family member, so cherished for her vitality, her warmth, her
perfect challah bread, had been diagnosed with an inoperable
brain tumor and died six months later. Judith cried as she spoke
and explained to me the custom of sitting <i>shivah</i>. As she finished,
she took a deep breath.


"However," she said, "That is not the grandmother I meant."


We had only ten minutes left, and she began to speak about
her father's mother, also beloved, although "very stern, a little
mean." This grandmother was getting old and needed to live
with one of her children. There had been discussion of her living
with Judith's family.


"I heard my parents talking about it. My mother thought it
might be too hard for her in our house with all the steps. But
my father said in my uncle's house there were just as many steps.
My mother said fine, she is welcome here, and I think my father
wasn't sure if ‘Nonny’ should come or not. But she was going
to come, my mother said, and we were going to move rooms

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What happened then?"


"Everyone in the whole family, all my aunts and uncles were
saying if Judith is sick and going to the hospital it's not good to
have Nonny there. I mean, I don't know if that's the reason.
But I don't think Nonny is coming to live with us."


"How do you feel about that?"


"I don't know. It might be good or bad. Good for my mom,
but bad for my dad or possibly bad for Nonny, and I feel it's
not directly my fault, but it somewhat is."


I asked if she had ever talked about this with her parents.
<i>No</i>. She had heard her mother say, "How does your father
think we will manage? Who does he think will be helping
Nonny in the bathroom nine times a day?" Otherwise, she had
heard them talking to each other about it, and it always made
her upset when she heard her own name mentioned.


I said it might be adding some stress to the family, and that
talking can relieve stress. Would she be willing to bring it up in
front of her parents? She said she would think about it.


A few nights later, I got a call from Dr. Shapiro saying that
Judith was in the emergency room, and that I was free—although
not obliged—to come down. He thought I should
know that the parents had asked for me.


When I arrived, she was stabilized, and I asked if we could
have a family meeting.


Judith apologized profusely for causing this problem and
spoiling everyone's evening. I asked the parents if this was
typical of Judith. Did she blame herself for whatever went

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Judith says it's OK for me to mention that she worries
about her grandmother."


"About my mother?" asked Rabbi Kaplan. "Judith, is this
true? Why are you crying?"


Mrs. Kaplan asked, "Is this about Nonny living with us? Oh,
Judith!"


The parents outlined the story as Judith had told it to me.
The fact was she felt responsible.


Judith said: "Nonny should be able to live with us. You told
Daddy it would be too much stress on my diabetes."


The Kaplans were surprised by the depth of Judith's feeling
about this, but they could see she spoke in earnest. With my encouragement,
they explained the situation to her. They had not, in
fact, made a decision about her grandmother, and certainly it was
not her fault. Her mother called Judith over and held her, and
her father spoke very gently, saying it was good she was speaking
her mind. It was remarkable, they said, to see her cry like that; she
was such a little stoic at home. Judith was due for a good sobbing,
I thought. She said little but wept like her heart was breaking.


I asked to see the parents alone in order to learn more about
this particular family issue. There is often more to a story than
parents are willing or able to say in front of children.


"My mother is eighty-two, and strong willed, and she wants
to live with us. I put the question to my wife."


"If my husband wants his mother to live with us, then it's
settled. I simply wondered if our house was the best choice
since we have so many steps, and also our children are

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The rabbi returned, "And I said, the steps are a nonissue, because
she would be on the first floor in any case. It's true that
my brother's children are grown, and that his house has more
room now. I have also an unmarried sister who has offered to
take my mother in."


I said to Mrs. Kaplan: "I suppose it would be a lot of work for
you with four children to have Nonny there. Is that a factor?"


Her husband intervened. "It would be difficult. I could un
derstand your not wanting to say no—I mean your <i>wanting</i> to
say no. Especially after Judith started needing so much attention.
You never told me so clearly how you felt."


I didn't comment on his slip, but I noticed it. It suggested to
me that he was hoping for a "yes" from his wife. Mrs. Kaplan
started to cry, and said:


"This is a woman who...." She had to collect herself and
start again. "My mother-in-law was in a concentration camp.
Who am I to call my life ‘difficult’?"


The truth was that Mrs. Kaplan's bad leg had been bothering
her a lot, but to refuse on this basis, she said, would be "utterly
selfish."


The word "selfish" hung heavy on the silence that followed.
Judith had used this word in her session with me. These were
the two least selfish people I had met lately, and both seemed
plagued by the thought that they weren't sufficiently giving.


There were several ways I could have intervened at this particular
moment. I could have turned to Rabbi Kaplan and said,
"Would you think your wife ‘selfish’ if she were against your

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For some patients it would be enough to ask, "What's so bad
about being selfish?" Indeed, for many members of our culture,
looking out for Number One is the <i>summum bonum</i>. I
wanted to move Mrs. Kaplan to compassion for herself, without
sounding like the voice of pop culture. If I ventured beyond
the secular and quoted something from the Scripture I
know well, it might needlessly underscore our difference.


I had been taught one beautiful short passage from the Talmud,
and this, years ago. It suited the moment perfectly, but I
felt presumptuous holding forth like an insider. And what if,
nervous as I was, I got it wrong?


"Mrs. Kaplan, isn't there a wonderful passage in Scripture
that begins, ‘If I am <i>not for</i> myself...’?"


She nodded, and recited the three lines in Hebrew.


<i>Eem ain a-nee lee mee lee?<br />
Uch-sh'a-nee I'atsmi ma a-nee?<br />
V'eem loh achshav ei matai?</i>


The rabbi's smile was luminous. He was clearly moved as he
translated the passage into English for me:


<i>If I am not for myself, who will be for me?<br />
If I am only for myself, what am I?<br />
If not now, when?</i>

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Husband and wife looked at me with warmth and respect.
Then they looked at each other, and Mrs. Kaplan said to her
husband, "Moshe, I need more of your help with—" and again
English disappeared from the airwaves.


This time I did not feel excluded. They were talking to each
other about things obviously personal. Mrs. Kaplan had taken
the topic I raised and used it to ask her husband for something
for herself. More help with the children, more support on the
matter of his mother, or perhaps simply more recognition for
how much she was already doing. I don't know. But of one
thing I felt sure—that Judith's improvement depended on their
speaking their minds more fully to each other.


"Dr. Luepnitz, are you telling us that this family dilemma
caused Judith's life-threatening crisis?" asked Mr. Kaplan.


Events are multiply caused, I replied. But I did think that Judith's
recent troubles had to do with worrying: about the family
as a whole, about her grandmother's welfare, about how hard
her parents worked, about her mom, especially. She was clearly
a very sensitive child who took on the distress of others as her
own. This sensitive child had also recently lost someone supportive
in whom she confided—Miriam. I had noticed also
that the first hospitalization coincided with the anniversary of
Mrs. Kaplan's mother's death, a loss I imagined to be particularly
devastating. (So devastating, perhaps, that she had had to
negate it in response to Dr. Shapiro's questions. "There have
been no deaths, no accidents.... ") It was not long after her
mother's death that Mrs. Kaplan had been asked to take in
her mother-in-law. In some situations, a new person in the
household could attenuate the pain of mourning. However,
the elder Mrs. Kaplan was herself unwell, requiring extensive
daily care. And difficult as it is to admit, most of us have had a

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. Kaplan's reservations about the move, her fear of being
depleted, her shame about her selfishness, her anger with
her husband for posing the question in the first place—much
of this had gone unspoken. Judith's symptom had the unintended
effect of solving the problem. As long as she was in
trouble, it made sense for her grandmother to live elsewhere,
while no one had to take responsibility for saying, "We've decided
against it." No one had to seem selfish.


It was a satisfying session, but for me only a kind of begin
ning. My preference would have been to pick up these themes
and work through them thoroughly over weeks and months. I
might have held sessions with the parents alone, focusing on
communication and mutual aid so that their grown-up anxicues
did not slip into the hearts and minds of their children. I
might have worked alone with Judith on the issues Dr. Shapiro
had raised in the beginning: puberty, sexuality, competition,
and anger. Judith's first crisis had occurred just after she refused
to finish bathing her brother. What feelings about her
own changing body had that soapy little boy evoked? Also, Ju
dith had reached the "magic" age of eleven, the year that psy
chologist Carol Gilligan has noted as pivotal for girls. This is
the age when girls are expected to make a psychological break
from their mothers—one that boys are required to make at a
younger age. Girls are supposed to reorient themselves toward
a heterosexual world, preparatory to marriage and motherhood.
Given the difficult lives of their mothers, no wonder
some adolescent girls look at them and protest, verbally or
otherwise.


These topics were on <i>my</i> agenda, not the family's. The par
ents had revealed a great deal in the emergency room session.

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Afterward, the windows seemed to close a bit, and I was asked
to focus on Judith, and to bring the therapy to an end.


I did. Judith had a good week following her hospital visit.
Not only were her blood-sugar numbers good, but she was acting
livelier and brighter. When we met alone, she said she felt
much better having spoken about Nonny. Her parents had
continued to speak of the problem during the week, and she
listened at their door. She had fallen behind in her Hebrew
studies, and really wanted a tutor. I told her that if she were to
speak up in a family session, I would support her.


Judith asked how many more sessions we would have to
have. I was curious about her own desire for further treatment.
Some adolescents will make it known directly or indirectly that
they object to their parents' attempt to rush the process. In
such cases, I argue on behalf of the patient, and the majority
of parents cooperate. In this instance, it seemed that both Judith
and her parents wanted to do the minimum amount of
work and return to business as usual.


Before we finished the hour, Judith asked me to give her
some tips for lowering stress. I helped her come up with two.
She wrote them slowly on notebook paper and said she would
post them in her room. They were:


1. Trust parents to handle their own worries.


2. State clearly what I want and be prepared to compromise
if necessary.


In the next family meeting, Judith asked for a new tutor and
also for study time with her father. Mr. Kaplan said he would
be pleased to spend time with her, but that he would discuss
the matter first with Dr. Shapiro and his colleagues. He wondered
if the doctors would advise her to take it easy for the

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I made another suggestion. Her brothers had gone from doing
no housework to doing all of it when Judith was ill. Would
it be possible to distribute evenly both chores and study time
with Father from now on?


The parents said it seemed eminently sensible.


Three sessions remained—two with Judith alone and a final
family meeting.


I wanted to be sure that Judith was feeling as strong as she
looked in that last session. She seemed confident and chatty in
those two hours with me alone. She said she had decided she
could worry less about her parents. And why was that? I asked.


"I don't know," she said. "I just get the feeling that they can
take care of things themselves. They never wanted me to worry
about them."


In order to understand this change in psychoanalytic terms,
we again need the construct of projective identification—the
splitting off of painful emotions and "storing" them in another
person. Judith's parents had had a difficult time managing their
grief, anger, and frustration, and Judith had unconsciously "volunteered"
to carry the feelings for them. Talking redistributed
the emotional weight. The parents agreed to take on more, and
Judith experienced relief.


She was looking a bit plumper and had better color. I asked
about school, and she said she had done a report on diabetes
for the class. Her classmates were impressed with how much
she knew, and how much she had experienced.


"Remember the movie? When the other kids wanted to see
a comedy and I didn't? The one I wanted to see was called
<i>Shoah</i>, because I had heard my father talking about it with

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I see what you mean, Judith. You know, the first time we
talked about this, you didn't mention the name of the movie.
Was there a reason?"


"I didn't know if you had seen it."


"Right. Actually, I have seen it. It's a very good and important
movie, and indeed very long. Did you mention the incident
to your parents?"


"No, because I was afraid they might be really upset about
the kids who laughed, and call the school, and then they would
just be meaner to me. Because they're all into boys and clothes,
and I'm not."


I asked if she had the chance to talk at home about her family's
own experience during the <i>Shoah</i>.


"My Nonny was in a camp. I know about it. They don't hush
it up or anything."


Judith added that this was a topic she used to discuss with
Miriam, the friend who moved away. It was at this point that
we spoke of ways she could stay in touch with Miriam.


There were several indications that the Holocaust weighed
monumentally on Judith's mind. As I looked at her drawing of
the house bellowing black smoke, I wondered if she had represented
something about her grandparents' wartime trauma. I
asked Judith directly if she thought her nightmares had to do
with the Holocaust. She said she didn't know.


We can say without a doubt, however, that as challenging as
adolescence is for children in our culture, those who grapple

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Judith feared that if her grandmother moved in, she herself
would get even less attention from both parents. The notion
that she had chosen her own needs over those of someone
who had suffered so much had filled her with anxious self-reproach,
just as it had her mother.


"I feel more like I can speak up now, since we started com
ing here. I was feeling so guilty all the time. But really, no one
thinks I'm bad," said Judith.


On the afternoon of our last session, Mrs. Kaplan phoned
to say that all four children would be attending, but that her
husband would join us late, following a meeting.


At the stroke of six, the receptionist called to say that the
Kaplans had arrived. In the waiting area, I asked Judith to introduce
me to her brothers David and Nathan. Sam gave me a
little wave and darted ahead for the toy-box.


When we were settled in my office, Judith announced that
her diabetes was back under control. She began cracking her
knuckles to make her brothers laugh and groan. Judith seemed
less encumbered than before, almost silly.


In order to engage the children as a group, I asked about the
Bubby stories Judith had written. I learned that David had illustrated
the books, and that all three boys liked hearing Judith
read them aloud. I liked the titles: <i>Bubby and the Kangaroo, Bubby
Is a Detective, Astronaut Bubby</i>. I hadn't seen Judith's lighter side
until now, and I wondered if the stories were as comical as they
sounded. In the session, the children began to talk about their
grandmother, whom they greatly missed.


Nathan, the seven year-old, changed the subject to ask why
they had come here. As he spoke, I heard Rabbi Kaplan tap
ping on the door, and I rose to let him in. The kids seemed glad

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Diabetes is a problem that gets worse when a person is up
set, and sometimes the person doesn't even know what's both
ering them, so the doctors invite the whole family to come
figure it out together, like a puzzle."


It was a fine answer, I thought. I glanced over at Mrs. Kap-
lan, who was smiling and nodding. We were on the same page.


"So, what was bothering her?" asked David.


Judith laughed. "Everything!"


"Judith is such a caring person, as you boys know, and she
was just worrying about everyone, about us and Nonny and
Mrs. Schwartz and Miriam, about everybody without end, like
the twenty four-hour store," said Mrs. Kaplan. "She was trying
so hard to help us and her teachers that it wore her out."


Rabbi Kaplan looked at me and said warmly:


"Judith likes to be a Good Samaritan."


I was touched by this reference to the New Testament. It
felt like a gift. I had shown my acquaintance with their tradition,
and he was acknowledging mine. I said to the family:


"It's a good thing, to show compassion, isn't it?"


"it's what we love about Judith," her father said.


"But there has to be a balance between giving and taking,"
Mrs. Kaplan said. "Between doing and resting."


And the six of them talked about giving and receiving and
about why they had decided to divide the chores more equally
among them.


"Judith was worrying way too much. Is it possible to worry
too little?" I asked.


"Yes," said Mrs. Kaplan, and she pointed to her husband
with both hands.

"What's this? I'm needed to worry more? I don't follow—"


"You follow," said Mrs. Kaplan amiably. "You agreed to react
a little more to things so that Judith and I can react less."


"Oh yes, fine. We talked about that."


"Don't tell me you forgot!" she said, pushing her point.


"I didn't forget, Ruth. I said, ‘Yes, we talked about that.’"


"OK. Sorry. You sound very tired."


"Tired, yes, can we move on? Yes?" His pique was rising. I
felt the tension move right up my spine.


My eyes were glued to Judith during this exchange. She was
fiddling with her hair ribbons and using them as a mustache to
entertain Sam. The last time her parents had disagreed in a session,
she had spilled the marbles, creating a distraction. Once
again, sparks were flying, but Judith was sitting in her chair like
an eleven-year-old girl, not standing over us like a human lightning
rod.


I had a decision to make about her parents' brief tiff—to
open it up, or not. I had agreed to the goal of getting Judith
back on track medically, and we had accomplished that without
probing into their relationship. What was obvious was that they
had continued the therapy conversation at home, and that is always
a good sign. Even more auspicious was Judith's ability to
hear conflict without reacting. I decided to comment on that.


"Judith, you asked me for tips on handling stress. I said the
first one was: ‘Trust parents to handle their own worries.’ It
looks to me like you've worked on that one."


She put two hands in the air and said, "Thank you!"


Everyone clapped except the rabbi, who seemed a bit distracted.
Only ten minutes remained.


Mrs. Kaplan glanced down at the Bubby books and said she
had not seen the latest volume in Judith's oeuvre: <i>Astronaut
Bubby</i>.

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I invited Judith to read from that book, and to show us
David's wonderful illustrations.


She did, and everyone clapped, including her father.


Our time was up. They thanked me profusely, and we said
our good byes with the understanding that they could call me
again at any time.


No such call ever came.


Henceforward, Judith would carry the diagnosis of ordinary
Type I diabetes, no longer "superlabile." Whatever it was that
once made her dangerously "prone to slip" had been righted,
we agreed, by <i>talking</i>.


Psychotherapy doesn't cure all ills. It can't mend fractured
bones or fix a damaged pancreas. But it is particularly good at
addressing the perilous slips involved in psychosomatic illness,
when the body is forced to speak for us.


Lacan's concept of the three registers is helpful here: By this
I mean his interlocking circles labeled the symbolic, the imaginary,
and the real. According to Lacan, a failure in the <i>symbolic—</i>
the realm of language and representation—is bound to return
in the <i>real</i> (in this case, Judith's physical calamity). One could
think of our work as addressing this catastrophic slip between
registers.


In many families, six sessions' worth of talking would not
be enough to produce meaningful results. In a family like the
Kaplans, however, in which adults are willing to reflect, take in
new data, and change family rules, even a bit of therapy can
make a difference. This is particularly true when the presenting
complaint is discrete, as with a medical crisis, and of recent onset.
Three months of work were enough to reduce one of the
famous "four factors of diabetes"—stress.


What, we may well ask, is this stuff? No one has ever seen
it, few can define it accurately, but we all know when we have it.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We seem to want less of it and with good medical reasons.
Physicians consider stress a compelling factor not only in dia
betes but also in heart disease, hypertension, and cancer.


The word "stress" derives from the Latin <i>strictus,</i> meaning
"compressed." Etymologically, then, stress has to do with too
little room and a need to spread out.


This etymology puts me in mind of Winnicott's notion of
<i>potential space</i>—that, intermediate area between the subjective
and objective in which creativity and play occur. Psychotherapy
is akin to play, according to Winnicott. Therapy takes place neither
inside the mind of the patient nor inside that of the therapist,
but in some middle area, in the potential space between
them.


Judith and her parents were concerned with their house-hold's
physical space, and also with the psychological space
they needed to provide for various family members. The family
used my consulting room—two rooms, actually—to spread
out emotionally. A debate formerly waged inside Judith's head
moved out to fill the airwaves of the family meetings. This
opened new avenues of communication all around. Thus did
the Kaplans, and Judith in particular, lose some compression,
some stress.


Is it possible to speak of a transference relationship in a
therapy of such brief duration? I believe so, although it could
not be developed or interpreted. Most of the time, I felt not
like a good or bad mother or father with the Kaplans, but like a
respected family friend. It's my impression that I played the
part of Miriam in the family's unconscious. The parents, although
wary of psychological intervention, permitted Judith to
confide in me about things personal, as they had allowed her
to confide in Miriam. As a teacher of Hebrew, she would have
understood the rabbi's initial greeting.

I received a note from the family three months later saying
Judith was doing well. Her health was fine, and she had a new
Hebrew tutor.


For many years afterward, Ken Shapiro would see me in the
hospital cafeteria and say, "Your girl is still doing great!" I was
delighted, hut continued to wonder about the rest of the family:
How would the parents manage their marital conflict over
time? Would another child become symptomatic?


Judith, in any case, never returned to the emergency room
after the age of eleven.


Therapy opens up the imaginative worlds of both patient and
therapist. I learned a good deal from working with the Kap
lans, and one small example speaks volumes.


Several months after our final session, I reread the story of
the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke. The parable, well
known, concerns a man who is set upon by thieves and left for
dead. He cries out for help, but passersby, including a priest,
turn a blind eye. Only one person stops to help, a Samaritan.


[The Samaritan] bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
wine, and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn
and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed,
he took out two coins and gave them to the innkeeper and
said unto him, "Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."


"<i>Take care of him</i>" says the Samaritan. He delegates the care
taking of the victim to another! The story of the Good Samar
itan is not, as I had vaguely recalled, one of selfless, endless

The story now strikes me as a kind of bookend to the passage
from the Talmud, "If I am not for myself...." Both
point to a balance between concern for self and a concern for
others—a lesson for all times. And for all porcupines.
