BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Hi Catherine. (Chuckles).
CLIENT: Hello.
THERAPIST: Different office today. (Chuckles).
CLIENT: Yeah, I saw, I was -
THERAPIST: I like this one though, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's very big. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Yeah. Oh, like that little closet we were in. (Laughs).
CLIENT: Yeah, how are you?
THERAPIST: Good. You got here okay in the weather.
CLIENT: Yeah, I actually just ended class like five minutes ago.
THERAPIST: Oh, really? Oh, so - well, lucky this is the - your regular time.
CLIENT: Yeah, so.
THERAPIST: How close - you go to Shimer?
CLIENT: Yeah, I go right there.
THERAPIST: So is it right - where is -
CLIENT: It's right around the corner.
THERAPIST: That's so convenient.
CLIENT: Yeah, so.
THERAPIST: Oh, that works well for you. (Chuckles).
CLIENT: I still got like wet and all.
THERAPIST: I know, I know. I broke out my fall boots.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (Laughs). (inaudible) today.
CLIENT: Yeah, I was - I originally was leaving the house in sandals, and then my roommate was like, "Ah, it's raining out right now."
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: And I was like, "Oh." (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Yeah, good - good call. (Laughs). So how did this week go? Or, it's only been like three days since I saw you. [0:01:04.5]
CLIENT: Yeah. Yesterday I actually - I ended up doing it Wednesday, yesterday, I went into three stores.
THERAPIST: You did?
CLIENT: So I - one of them wasn't - the Bebe wasn't hiring, but I filled out an application anyway, and then Limited and Footlocker are the other two because - I mean Limited - I figured I'd do it anyway. Footlocker, I asked to speak to the manager at every place, so it wasn't that bad.
THERAPIST: Why did you ended up not doing it that day?
CLIENT: I think I just got sidetracked to be honest.
THERAPIST: (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah. It wasn't that I was hesitant; and then the next day I kind of just - I got up, I had two meetings at school, and then I - once I got home I went right to it. I was like, "All right, I have to do this, I'm seeing Christy tomorrow."
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: Do this today. So I think because I didn't really sit and then like do something else and then think about it, it was easier for me to just keep going, and I went out. [0:02:09.2]
THERAPIST: Good. That's great. I'm so proud of you.
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: How did you feel getting it done?
CLIENT: I felt good. I just - now it makes me want to look - apply to more places when I have more of a choice.
THERAPIST: Because definitely the job market is crappy right now.
CLIENT: Yeah, so.
THERAPIST: So if you don't get any - well how do you feel about like getting them because all it is, is an application, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So do they usually call you back? I've never actually worked retail.
CLIENT: Normally I'll call back in either like a week or a few days or something and - just so they have my name kind of thing, talk who I am, but otherwise they usually call back within - I guess if they are hiring within that week, or (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: And they - calling to have an interview?
CLIENT: Yeah, an interview.
THERAPIST: So is that more the part that you would be nervous with, or was it just as bad to walk in and to talk to the managers and stuff? [0:03:02.2]
CLIENT: I think it's probably more nerve wracking to do the interviews because you never know - like some of them will have you like be hands on, like, "Here, make an outfit if you had to go out on a Saturday night, or if someone came in here and needed an outfit for Saturday night."
THERAPIST: Really? I never knew they tested you like that.
CLIENT: Yeah, some do, so it's always like - you never know if it's going to be like one, two, three interview over, or if they're going to actually -
THERAPIST: Test your fashion skills.
CLIENT: Yes -
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: It gets a little intimidating, but I don't know, it's more - I'm just nervous about getting a job and then -
THERAPIST: And keeping it.
CLIENT: And keeping it. That's what my whole thing, like -
THERAPIST: Okay, and that's something that we can definitely work on here.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess -
THERAPIST: When you were going in to the stores, were there any like thoughts that like, "If I could just get out of this real easy right now," or was it mostly like, "I'm going to see Christy, I have to do this"?
CLIENT: No, it was more like, "All right, don't shop -" [0:04:02.7]
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: "And go and talk to them right away." Like I just kind of went - in each store I just went straight there - straight into the front desk area.
THERAPIST: And did you get any of the physiological feelings (crosstalk)?
CLIENT: I actually didn't. I don't know if it was because I was more just like - I didn't treat it as like - I don't know, something that I had to like life or death situation, it was more just, "Okay, this is something Christy wants me to do, why don't I do it? It'll take, what? Five minutes at each place."
THERAPIST: And do you think it was helpful that we went in with that attitude of - we're talking about how this is not about getting the job, this is about just doing the exercise?
CLIENT: It was helpful because I think I at lot of things I'm always just like, "All right, I have to get this," or you know, I always give myself an ultimatum.
THERAPIST: And you said something interesting, like it's not life or death situation, but sometimes I bet it - you make it seem that way -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, about keeping the job, or, "If I don't keep this job like what does it say about me?" [0:05:02.0]
CLIENT: That's what I feel like it about with say I do end up getting a job any time soon, I feel like it I do look at it as a life or death - you know, loosely using that term -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Situation about keeping it. Like, "This will make me or break me," type thing, even though I know - whenever say something happens, I get anxiety, if for some reason I quit this job because - relating to that - like I know that that's not the end. I can go apply for another job, but at the same time, that's what scares me, like -
THERAPIST: So do you think it will - it helps when you think of it like, "This is a life or death situation, I have to keep this job"?
CLIENT: No. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: It probably increases that anxiety.
CLIENT: Not at all because with - just the applying for them just kind of release some of the anxiety just thinking, "Okay, I don't have to work at one of these three places, but it would be nice to get interviewed just to get myself comfortable." [0:06:00.0]
THERAPIST: Definitely, and that's hopefully - I think definitely in this market is the way to go just to apply to as many - it doesn't - there's no harm -
CLIENT: Yeah, so.
THERAPIST: In filling (inaudible) if you have the time, and also I had a question: When you went into the first store, did you have maybe like that anxiety more than when you had it when you went into the third store?
CLIENT: Yeah, when I went into the second and third store it was - I didn't really think much before. When I went to the first store, I was like, "All right, what am I going to say? How am I going to approach them? Who am I going to approach? But then after doing the first one, I kind of just - I guess after that I just went right in and did the same thing
THERAPIST: Definitely, so -
CLIENT: Repeated.
THERAPIST: It just exactly shows that the more you do it, (crosstalk) do it again.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Now you're going to go into ones that maybe are a little more intimidating that you (crosstalk) -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like are there any other stores that you feel like are a real reach for you to get?
CLIENT: We're avoiding restaurants, although I would like to work in a restaurant, but I'm more avoiding that because I never have - well, I have back home on Long Island; I was a hostess. [0:07:02.4]
THERAPIST: And you said you were a hostess, right?
CLIENT: But that was a completely different situation that I grew up with the people that worked there.
THERAPIST: It doesn't matter though, it's experience, and they don't know that, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, but I just feel like I'm kind of nervous to like - I don't know if I'll step into that area even though -
THERAPIST: Well, once again, why don't we just go in with an attitude of, "If I don't have enough experience, I don't get it. It's not a big deal." Like, "I'm walking in for the exercise of applying to a restaurant." And you can -
CLIENT: I think I'm more nervous about getting it. I don't know (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: But you don't have to take it, right?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: And it's practicing your anxiety and then hopefully it'll get less and less and maybe eventually you will be able to deal with the anxiety of working a job where you don't know what the hell you're doing. (Laughs).
CLIENT: I think that's my main thing of just getting a job where I don't know what I'm doing at all and like just I guess how I'm going to be judged at that point -
THERAPIST: So why would -
CLIENT: Because I would like a job in like a restaurant because I feel like that's something I could do while going to school, the hours would be flexible, and it's just I'm - like I don't know, I would want them to be like, "Oh, you have this job," but then once I got it I feel like I'd be like, "Oh, no." [0:08:14.5]
THERAPIST: Well, do you think you're the first person who's never worked in a restaurant who then starts to work in a restaurant before?
CLIENT: No, not at all. Like -
THERAPIST: So everybody has to start there sometime.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know why I have - like I feel like I'm not going to be able to do it. Like my friends who - you know, obviously they started somewhere, and I have heard horror stories, and they laugh about it, but for some reason I look at it like, "Oh, I'm not going to be able to do that," or, "Oh, if that happened to me like oh, no," like what would I think?
THERAPIST: Well, how do you think they handle it. You said they laugh about it.
CLIENT: Yeah, like I guess at the time they're probably like startled, but when they're telling me, they're just laughing about it. I know if I was - I'd feel like if I was telling them the story, I'd be like, "Oh, my God, I can't believe I did that," and I'd just be freaking out, I don't know. And they just say it with so like, "Oh, I dropped a whole tray of food," and I'm like - [0:09:10.5]
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: "Oh, wow."
THERAPIST: But if you hear it, it's probably like if you talk to anyone who works at a restaurant.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They must all do that sometime, right?
CLIENT: I'm sure, yeah, especially when you just start.
THERAPIST: Definitely. And you've seen people - I mean I guess sometimes like I've had (inaudible) bitch and been like, "(Grunts), I can't believe this job," but I think most of the time don't you feel really bad for them as a patron?
CLIENT: Yeah, actually one time they dropped - me and my friend were at Red Lobster and the waitress dropped plates - a few - a little bit of food got on my, a lot of food got on my friend's coat, and my friend was so mad, and I was like, "No," like, "She didn't mean it," and I felt so bad for her and all. And my friend wasn't saying anything or anything bad, but I did feel bad, like -
THERAPIST: So sometimes people not be so angry.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Some people might. [0:10:00.2]
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? But you said when you're working in retail it wouldn't bother you so much if someone was a bitch to you because you know it's just part of it.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like also because in retail - in - if I was like say a waiter or something, that table is my responsibility, so - but in retail it's more like that customer is not only your responsibility, like you do have to help them out. You kind of like cycle - like, oh, if you can't help them at that moment or you don't know something, you just get another employee and they're right next to you.
THERAPIST: You do that you could do that as a waitress?
CLIENT: I guess yeah, but it's more like quick (inaudible) I guess.
THERAPIST: It's a little faster, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But there are slower paced restaurants you know.
CLIENT: That's true -
THERAPIST: Not all of them -
CLIENT: You don't always have to go around.
THERAPIST: Not -
CLIENT: Plus I don't - I'd rather steer clear of anything too crazy, but - or too big of a restaurant.
THERAPIST: Yeah, so there are slower paced restaurants and there are places where actually bosses are going to be complete assholes - [0:11:00.4]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: To you and there are places where they might be nice, but is there any way you could go in looking like - you know school, like sometimes school gets hard?
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: Sometimes professors might be rude to you. Are they ever?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: To you? But you can take it because it's part of the school experience, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's what you expect.
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: Sometimes people are going to be assholes, sometimes people are going to be rude.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Sometimes you fail a test, that's part, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So is there any way you could look at working at a restaurant or any job, you know, that's stressful, "This is just part of the job, sometimes people are going to be rude to me. Sometimes I'm going to make a fool of myself."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But everybody does it.
CLIENT: I know. I like under - like I - I understand -
THERAPIST: But it's okay for other people to do it, why is it not okay for you to do it?
CLIENT: I don't - I don't know. Like I don't know why I feel like that, I just feel - I don't want - I don't know, I don't want them to think negative I guess about me, and I don't know why it always comes back to that, but that's like what I'm always thinking when I'm on a job, like, "Oh, I hope this - I do this right," or if I do something wrong and they - not yell at me, but if they're just like, "Oh, you were supposed to do this," whatever, I take it like very personally. [0:12:06.6]
THERAPIST: Okay, so you - suppose you take something personally. You know, you take someone - someone is judging you, what is so bad about that?
CLIENT: I don't know. I guess it just makes me feel bad about myself kind of.
THERAPIST: So if that other people are judging me, now I feel like shit?
CLIENT: Yeah, and I know I shouldn't care about what they think, but I don't know, I just analyze it in my head and kind of like, "Oh, I see what they -"
THERAPIST: Do you say, "I'm such a loser," do you say things like that?
CLIENT: No, not like, "I'm such a loser," but I just - I feel bad, like, "Oh, I let this person down. Oh, I should have done it like this; this is my fault."
THERAPIST: Okay, so it's kind of like you did your job wrong and that's - and then that means that's poor.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like that's poor to you to have - to have done something -
CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel like -
THERAPIST: Worse than the way you have the capability of doing it.
CLIENT: Yeah, and I feel like they must be annoyed now, like this probably upset them now. [0:13:01.0]
THERAPIST: So it's more like -
CLIENT: It's like both ways (crosstalk) -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: You don't want to upset anybody, and if you upset somebody you feel bad about yourself -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you put yourself down for that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: "Oh, I'm such a terrible person, I can't believe I made them feel bad."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. But saying things like, "Oh, I'm such a bad person," is there any way that you can see, Catherine, as having more qualities just because you did something bad in one situation?
CLIENT: Yeah, like I don't know. I feel like I get so concentrated on that situation, like all my - like anything else goes out the window, like I don't even -
THERAPIST: But there's so many other things about you, then you said, "Oh, I'm a terrible person." Can you say something like, "You know, I made a mistake in this one situation; I'll learn from it"?
CLIENT: Yeah. I wish -
THERAPIST: You know what I mean?
CLIENT: I wish I can - (crosstalk) -
THERAPIST: It's like you got to practice doing that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because I bet you do it in other parts of life, just -
CLIENT: I do, like -
THERAPIST: Being late or like, "Oh, I suck so much this person is going to be mad at me." [0:14:02.6]
CLIENT: Yeah, in certain situations I'm like - I don't know how I let them go, but others I dwell on and I just -
THERAPIST: Because obviously they hold more importance to you, but in the grand scheme of life, Catherine, you know you're a student who works hard, you're - you seem like you're really close with your family, you're a good daughter, you're a good sister, you have a couple of very close friends who probably really count on you, you're a good friend to them. You know you have all these wonderful things about you, that you're responsible, you're like always on time - you know, like today you were a few minutes late, but you had class.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know what I mean? Like you're a responsible person. There's all these wonderful things that make up about you, and you have some negatives as well, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Some social anxiety makes it difficult, you worry a lot, but why - the fact - you know, like that one bad thing cancels out all the others in that situation?
CLIENT: I don't know, I never thought about it like that I guess. I don't really think of the good things.
THERAPIST: When that situation happens -
CLIENT: Yeah. [0:14:57.0]
THERAPIST: That's all you think. So that's the same thing as changing the way you think like you know, "I can stand it even if this happens. I wish - I'd prefer it not to happen like this, but I can stand it if it happens this way." In these situations you can say the same thing, you know like, "I wish I didn't mess up there, but it doesn't make me a terrible person. I still have other qualities," right?
CLIENT: I think I need to practice more thinking positive, rather than -
THERAPIST: And it doesn't have to be just positive, but seeing yourself so - I went to a good lecture where - (inaudible) (chuckles) because I don't want (inaudible) - but basically talking about, "Oh, I messed up, now I'm a stupid person." You know, "I did this, now I feel like just a stupid idiot," and the person basically was sitting on stage giving this talk on doing therapy. (inaudible) glass of water, and all of a sudden he goes like this, (does something visual), and splashes his face.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And apparently he did that in front of his patients and said, "Okay, I just did a stupid thing," right? [0:16:00.9]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Am I a stupid person?
CLIENT: No. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Right? If I just picked up a bottle - I'm not going to really do it -
CLIENT: (Laughs).
THERAPIST: I'm not that dedicated. (Laughs). But if I was sitting here and picked this up and threw it in my face and I was soaking wet, you'd be like, "That's a little weird."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But would you think I was an idiot?
CLIENT: No, I wouldn't - I would just laugh like, and then forget about it like (chuckles).
THERAPIST: Yeah because I do - I can do therapy, I come in on time -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, hopefully I'm a nice person. There's other things that you judge people on.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you're just judging yourself on one action here and there -
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: And you're letting it really get to you.
CLIENT: Yes, I think I definitely focus on that specific action that - whatever it was that happened, (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: What you said or what you didn't say, (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah, and I really want to like avoid fixating on like whatever negative thoughts are going through my mind, but I feel like that's just what I always, always do.
THERAPIST: Well, how do you change that? You know, just because that's what you always do, does that mean that's what you're always going to do?
CLIENT: I guess I have to just stop myself in my train of thought and just -
THERAPIST: No, exactly! [0:17:02.3]
CLIENT: Switch it.
THERAPIST: That's - the point is that you're - the irrational beliefs, they're not going to just go away.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They're going to still be there, but every time they come into your head you need to replace it with a rational one.
CLIENT: Yes, I (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: And that can be a lot (inaudible) day depending on how many times you say it, but I bet you say it a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I need to practice it on a daily basis rather than just like -
THERAPIST: When you say you're setting a time to practice it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Like I need to just - well, like all day every day at random moments just think about it because I feel like even if I'm not - like the anxieties feeling, it's not like very strong, I can be walking down the street and I'm always thinking like about other people's reactions towards me, and like -
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Over analyzing it. I don't know why like -
THERAPIST: So there's two different things, there's the refractionism (ph), you know -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even though I make a mistake that doesn't make me a bad person -
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: You know? I wish I didn't make that mistake, but I can stand (inaudible) - you know? That I - [0:18:02.6]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But what about the reactions, the judgments of others; what can you say to yourself?
CLIENT: I don't know. Mostly because people don't even know me, so it's like -
THERAPIST: So, "I'd prefer if people didn't judge me."
CLIENT: Yeah, but -
THERAPIST: I can't control the other world, I'm not going to let that control my life.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean they can' hurt me.
THERAPIST: Why let strangers that - you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Affect you because in this case it'll be strangers, in other things in life sometimes there'll be people that you run into again, but most of the time it's strangers -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? And you're letting these people. You're just your own person, you're in school, you're doing all the things, you want to get a job, you want to be responsible, but you're letting all these other people control your life.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you don't even know them.
CLIENT: I know. (Chuckles). I mean -
THERAPIST: So can you say - you know?
CLIENT: And it's a difference between when I'm walking like alone on the street and then if I walk with a friend. I don't even - I guess the distraction, I don't even really pay attention to the people around us, but when I'm walking alone, I notice, and like if I trip or something I like - bug I guess everyone gets that whole feeling too, (inaudible), but I'm like - I don't know, it just gets me - I don't know I over analyze. Like people could not even know that they looked at me and I think that, "Oh, they were just staring at me," like what's wrong," like - [0:19:21.8]
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: "What coming off?"
THERAPIST: (Laughs). So I do think that you should pursue - because that's what you want - the restaurant jobs, you know?
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: I think that's something that you should go for. So there's first the part that's going to be hard, is going to be selling yourself because I think you're going to just do the, "But I don't really have that much experience," you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Remember talked about fudging it to make it sound like more?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You don't have to lie.
CLIENT: To make - build myself up a little instead of like pointing out like -
THERAPIST: "That I don't have - I don't have real waitress experience, I've only been a hostess."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can say, "I've been hostess in this restaurant, but I feel like I've watched people doing waiting and I'm a fast learner." [0:20:03.5]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They always like hearing that. Do you say that kind of stuff?
CLIENT: Yeah, I do. Like I feel like each time is just different, whatever comes to my mind. I actually - my roommate was an assistant manager for a retail, like they have a few locations around Chicago, so she - and then she got promoted to doing all the new hires and interviewing and whatnot, and -
THERAPIST: Where does she work? Wait, this is the Desert Sun roommate?
CLIENT: Yeah. Before that she worked at H&amp;M.;
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, there's one right up here.
CLIENT: Yeah, she used to work there -
THERAPIST: My friend loves that store. (Laughs).
CLIENT: Yeah, and she had worked there for so long, so like she was one of the longest people there, so they had her do assistant managing, but I don't know - light work of it, but - so she does like interviews and whatnot, and she reviews resumes all the time, so I always like -
THERAPIST: But she still does that even though she works at -
CLIENT: No. I mean she no longer does that because she thought she was going to get more pay at Desert Sun, but that's not even (inaudible). [0:21:00.0]
THERAPIST: Wow. That's probably a lot crappier work too.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly, so - so I always have here like look through my resume and I'll be like, "Well, what do you think I should say about this or that?"
THERAPIST: So she's helpful with that.
CLIENT: So she - yeah, she does help me a lot with that because like she knows I guess what to look for and then things that like -
THERAPIST: They're going to ask.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's great. So then you can practice about the waitress. So do you have a few places in mind that you can go in?
CLIENT: See, that's the thing, I don't even know where - I guess -
THERAPIST: You were talking about it in a story I like, I guess there's all those small like Greek restaurants.
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel like a lot are family owned, but I guess -
THERAPIST: They got to hire somebody though.
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess they - I don't know, I guess it doesn't matter too much.
THERAPIST: Especially the times that you want to work are like nights, like probably people with families don't want to work -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess that's the best time you're paid though, so I don't know - in tips.
CLIENT: I wouldn't even mind to say I would work nights on the weekends, like hours that most people want off. Like I don't care about doing things, so - (chuckles). [0:22:00.0]
THERAPIST: Well - (laughs). We're going to get you out doing things too.
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: So maybe you'll be so conflicted and - (chuckles) - and you'll finally get the job.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I want you to go into three - I think that's a good number.
CLIENT: Three.
THERAPIST: Three restaurants, and now you're -
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And you can go into some more retail because it sounds like you're comfortable with that now.
CLIENT: Yeah, like I'm very comfortable with the whole retail - with applying for the job, but then when I get there it's a whole different (chuckles) story, but -
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I also don't - I know that I hate working in retail, but I feel like that's my most comfortable - like my easiest shot.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So that's why I kind of want to try something else, something different.
THERAPIST: Why not? Why not try? It takes five seconds to throw out an application, if they never call you back -
CLIENT: I don't want to be stuck -
THERAPIST: Are you going to take it personally if they don't call you back?
CLIENT: No, I've had that.
THERAPIST: And I think you can't - you know what I mean? You can take anything personally, but you got to always remember there's a thousand other factors.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Especially even if people are rude to you and things like that, taking it personally - you know -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Looking at the big picture, you know what I mean? Just like you look at the big picture with you, with yourself, "Oh, I have all these other things going on, why am I calling myself an idiot?" [0:23:07.3]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's one situation in one field, you know? In the same way, when somebody else is rude to you, you can say, "They could have had a bad day, they could have -"
CLIENT: That's true.
THERAPIST: The shitty economy, they might not be hiring, they might have gotten someone who was like - an amazing resume that I just don't have yet, so I think it's important to look at the big picture that way too.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So your main thing, it's (inaudible) about once you're there, well, in retail I guess you're worried about like talking with staff?
CLIENT: Yeah, and also - I feel like they want you to learn everything like that, which I understand you should learn quickly, but I feel like if I don't know something I'm like - I kind of after a while - like I don't want to ask anyone kind of thing because I feel like I should know this by now, and like that's also another thing, like - and also if I ever God forbid have to call out, that makes me feel like - [0:24:06.3]
THERAPIST: What do you mean call out?
CLIENT: Really bad. Like say I get sick or something, I'm always like -
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: "Oh, I can't call out." That - like one time I think I was sick for like a week and I couldn't work, and like they were getting annoyed at me, so I just didn't want to go back to work like after that. When I went back I ended up quitting because I was like -
THERAPIST: Because you felt like they judged you for taking that week off?
CLIENT: And I know it was just more them that they didn't have like extra people, so it was rough and whatever, and I know that like they've got people there that they can't even stand and that know that the boss can't stand them, and it's fine. Like everyone still likes each other on a friendly level, it just really made me uncomfortable.
THERAPIST: Wow, and it drove you to quitting because you were having these thoughts that they're -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: "They're talking about me. They're thinking bad about me."
CLIENT: But then I see like there's always that one person that doesn't do anything at every job, I feel like, that doesn't do anything and whatever, and that everyone behind their back like, "Oh, he's not doing his work again," or that the boss is always like having to yell at - and they're fine and they're like, "Ha, ha, ha," always joking around. Like - and I always look at them like, "I wish I could have that attitude," not to that extent obviously. [0:25:22.1]
THERAPIST: But why can't you just look at it as a job, "So I lose it"?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean right now you're not supporting a family.
CLIENT: That's what my - my roommate is always like, "So you - they fire if you if you don't go," and my mom like, "You're sick, you can't go in, so they fire you. What's the big deal? It's not the end of the world." And I'm always like -
THERAPIST: But to you it is.
CLIENT: Yeah, like I don't - because I feel like it's saying something about myself, like - I don't know.
THERAPIST: If you got fired it says something about you? What if only you knew that you got fired, would it still be as upsetting? Or is it more like everybody else knowing you got fired?
CLIENT: I think that it's more everyone else knowing that I got fired and - yeah, and my fellow employees even though I probably will never see them again after that. [0:26:08.6]
THERAPIST: So it's kind of an emotion - the emotion there, it's anxiety about future shame.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The shame that you never get to experience.
CLIENT: (Chuckles). Yeah. I don't know.
THERAPIST: Which leads me to your homework for this week: The restaurants -
CLIENT: The restaurants.
THERAPIST: It's homework, but I have more of a - this homework is going to be really hard because I know you're going to do the restaurant one.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You're - that one's fine, you're going to do it, right?
CLIENT: Yep, I'll do it.
THERAPIST: Okay. This one -
CLIENT: (Chuckles). Oh, God.
THERAPIST: This one is going to be tough, but if - yeah, I have a backup plan if you don't do it.
CLIENT: (Chuckles). Oh, God.
THERAPIST: So the backup is worse. So -
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: (Chuckling) so you better do the other one. Ellis is big on something called "Outward House (ph)," you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) was big on something called "shame attacking" exercises.
CLIENT: I don't know. Never heard of it.
THERAPIST: "Shame attacking" exercise it's a way basically that you make an ass of yourself - [0:27:01.6]
THERAPIST: And realize that you can handle it -
CLIENT: How?
THERAPIST: And that it's not the end of the world.
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: So I have a good one for you that I thought would be good.
CLIENT: (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Well, at first - I mean you could tell me - I'll give you some choices, okay?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: The real one though is about there's others judging you for speaking, first, for saying stupid things; that's a big one, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But then there's also the looking stupid.
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: You don't like that. Which one do you think is stronger?
CLIENT: I think saying stupid - something stupid because that I feel like affects me more deeply than the looking stupid.
THERAPIST: Okay. Would you like to work on that one?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: This is what's going to help. How do you feel about going out to like - I mean maybe you go to Lincoln Park or - I think that's like kind of an easier - or you can just do it on the street, you could do it back on your way here to therapy, you know? Something to talk about (inaudible), you could do it on your way home - going up to people on the street and asking them if they know what month and year it is. [0:28:00.0]
CLIENT: (Chuckles). They're going to think I'm insane.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: What month and year it is.
THERAPIST: "Excuse me, do you know what month it is?" Or, "Excuse me, do you know what year it is?"
CLIENT: (Chuckles). As long as no one decides they want to hit me for asking -
THERAPIST: You think someone is going to hit you for that?
CLIENT: I don't know.
THERAPIST: They're going to be like, "This poor crazy girl." (Chuckles).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think most people are going to tell you.
CLIENT: (Crosstalk) like, "Get out of here you crazy."
THERAPIST: Do you think you could do that?
CLIENT: I guess, yeah.
THERAPIST: To three people. I like the number three with you.
CLIENT: Okay, three people. I'm going to have to like -
THERAPIST: It can't be people you know. (Laughs).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Although you're going to be more embarrassed [then maybe] (ph).
CLIENT: I'll pick out the nicest looking people. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: You can pick out nice looking people.
CLIENT: Okay. I want to - I'll try because I want to see if I actually can -
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Get myself to do it.
THERAPIST: Deal with the fact that, "Okay, so they thought I was stupid."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: (inaudible).
CLIENT: I want to try it. I want to see if I can do it.
THERAPIST: And the more you can do this, you're going to make them - the other exercise I was thinking about - but it seems like you were okay with the process I was going to make you wear something silly and walk in and ask for a job application. [0:29:08.8]
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Like go into a nice store that you don't really plan on working at, you know, something -
CLIENT: I'll do it, but I don't think that would be as effective as actual speaking.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you want the speaking?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I like that you're being brave and saying you're going to take on -
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess sort of to see if I can (chuckles) actually - like because I feel like I can say, "Yeah, I'll do it," and then I start walking up to someone and I'm like, "Okay, never mind." (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Well, what are the statements that you're going to practice saying?
CLIENT: What do you mean? Like with the people -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Asking the people, or -
THERAPIST: Well, what are you going to tell yourself? Because what are your irrational beliefs? What do you think is - what's going to be going on in your head? What are the thoughts that are going to be going through your head?
CLIENT: My irrational ones?
THERAPIST: Um hm.
CLIENT: This person is going to get an attitude with me and think I'm crazy (chuckles) and think badly. This person will make fun of me, (crosstalk). [0:30:00.0]
THERAPIST: Okay, "And if they make fun of me."
CLIENT: Then I won't see them in like a second.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: They might make fun of you and they might think you're stupid, but the point is what do you say after that? So, "If this person might think I'm stupid," you might normally say, "I'm such an idiot," or - right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: That's mostly what it goes back to, so what are you going to say this time? So this person is going to think you're probably an idiot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? So what do you tell yourself? How do you make that okay?
CLIENT: Well, "Yeah, at least he doesn't know me because I obviously know the month and year it is, so -"
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: "What he's thinking is not really based on anything -"
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: Truthful. Like I don't know.
THERAPIST: And is one thing you say to a stranger once, is that based on anything truthful anyway - even if it was something that you really meant?
CLIENT: No. I mean it's something that will be forgotten.
THERAPIST: And it's based on one thing that you say in your entire life.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, like when you meet somebody -
CLIENT: Because you say a million things. [0:31:01.7]
THERAPIST: And you talk to them, it's the same - same thing.
CLIENT: That's another thing, is going out -
THERAPIST: I know.
CLIENT: And talking to people.
THERAPIST: But the more you talk to strangers -
CLIENT: Like having a conversation. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: But the more you talk to strangers you can say, "It's something that I said once and if he thinks I'm stupid -" I mean in this case you're saying things that are kind of stupid.
CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: I mean, who knows, you could have just flown in from another year -
CLIENT: Yeah, (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: A time machine. (Laughs).
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean you could say that, "I've just got abducted by aliens, can you tell me (laughs) the month and year?"
CLIENT: (Crosstalk) probably on the third person, I'll (inaudible) that.
THERAPIST: (Chuckles). You know, there's a reason why you don't know what day and year it is.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You could say, "I just got out of a coma," like (laughs), "Can you tell me the month?"
CLIENT: So I walked out of the hospital.
THERAPIST: Yeah, can you tell me the month and year? You know, you can make it as silly as you want, and the more that you can make it silly and you get comfortable with it -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It won't be such a big deal.
CLIENT: I think if I could laugh about it, it'll just make it easier.
THERAPIST: And you can laugh about it -
CLIENT: Laugh at myself.
THERAPIST: I think the trick is to find someone that you got - some guy that you think is like cute and then do it - [0:32:03.7]
CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: To him, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. And that will start a conversation.
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: I'll have to explain why I asked.
THERAPIST: No, no, you're not allowed to - you're not allowed to explain because that's what you want to do afterwards, "But actually this is just a psych experiment." You can't say that afterwards. (Laughs).
CLIENT: I'll be like, "Yeah, I just returned from Mars."
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: So this is going to make it easier, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then you can work up to just - instead of doing ridiculous things, you can work on just general talking. But once it's okay to make an ass of yourself...
CLIENT: I think it might be easier to say something like - go up to someone to say something like that than if I guess in the future just going up to a random person and asking them about something realistic.
THERAPIST: Yep. Well, since your roommate goes out, that's something I know that you want to work on, the jobs and the social stuff, so you know, your roommate goes out a lot, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, more than I do.
THERAPIST: Once a weekend?
CLIENT: Yeah, at least. [0:33:00.5]
THERAPIST: So that's more than you.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: That's a lot right now, right? So that's something else, you know, this week we're going to work on that, and once you get more comfortable with that we can work on going out and you know you'll have an assignment of like talking to like three guys at a bar.
CLIENT: (Chuckles). We'll see about that.
THERAPIST: (Chuckles).
CLIENT: I'm usually the one who's like, "No, I don't want to talk to you."
THERAPIST: What if you talk to an idiot? It'll be practice and you don't even care what they think, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, I feel like even if I'm talking to somebody who I think is absolutely ridiculous so I don't know - like I'm afraid - I'm always afraid I'm going to say something and they're going to be like, "What? What did you just say?" Like, "You're crazy," like -
THERAPIST: And if they say that?
CLIENT: I shouldn't care.
THERAPIST: Are you crazy?
CLIENT: No. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: No. Do you think you say crazy - I don't think you say crazy things.
CLIENT: No because I'd be like (chuckling) -
THERAPIST: (Laughs).
CLIENT: (inaudible).
THERAPIST: And even if you do.
CLIENT: That's true. I never - I do really think of it like that I guess, like -
THERAPIST: So you got to practice the rational thoughts.
CLIENT: Yep.
THERAPIST: Okay, so homework is going to -
CLIENT: Three restaurants.
THERAPIST: Three restaurants - [0:34:00.1]
CLIENT: And then -
THERAPIST: Applying, and then - because you probably won't get any call backs before you see me next.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? And we'll work on that, what you're going to do next if anyone has called.
CLIENT: Um hm.
THERAPIST: The next step, we'll work on more shame attack exercises.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I'm very excited to see how it goes.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So (inaudible), Catherine.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'll try at least - I will at least do a few people, I don't know about three. I'll try.
THERAPIST: Okay, okay.
CLIENT: I will try.
THERAPIST: When you go downstairs, can you fill out an OQ?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, I forgot last time actually.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I was like (inaudible), did I (inaudible)?
CLIENT: Yeah, so -
THERAPIST: It's okay. I'm sure they forgot to give it to you, or - I'm sure it was -
CLIENT: Yeah, so she actually mentioned it.
THERAPIST: On the way - yeah, no, she said on the way out that she was going to do that. So okay?
CLIENT: Okay. (Chuckles).
THERAPIST: Have a good week and I'll see Wednesday morning, right?
CLIENT: All right, thank you. Yep.
THERAPIST: Okay, by Catherine.
CLIENT: Thank you very much.
THERAPIST: Have a good weekend.
CLIENT: Ooh, what did I drop?
THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible).
CLIENT: Bye.
THERAPIST: Bye.
CLIENT: (inaudible) right?
THERAPIST: Yeah, and then you just go straight out I think.
CLIENT: Bye.
THERAPIST: Bye, have a good week. [0:34:56.2]
