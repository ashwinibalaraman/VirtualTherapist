Interviews are two-person conversations with a purpose of obtaining information
(Cannell &amp; Kahn, 1968-1969). The <i>clinical</i> interview is the most
frequently employed clinical assessment method in health settings (Edelstein
&amp; Berler, 1987; Haynes &amp; Jensen, 1979) and is typically considered the
"backbone of all mental health professions" (Shea, 1990, p. 283). Shea
described a 1982 survey of 482 psychiatric teachers and practitioners conducted
by Langsley and Hollender (1982) that revealed that 99.4% ranked the
conduct of an interview as an important requirement for a psychiatrist. He also
determined that 7 of the top 10 of 32 ranked skills were directly related to
interviewing techniques. Similarly, a survey of clinical psychologists by
Norcross, Prochaska, and Gallager (1989) revealed that the clinical interview
was used by 96% of those surveyed and comprised 39% of their assessment.


The initial interview is typically the first contact between the clinician and
the client and the first critical step in a process that can range from screening
to intervention. Moreover, its importance is considerable in terms of the
conceptualization of the problem and the establishment of rapport with the

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Psychometric Considerations</b>


Regardless of the specific objectives of a particular interview or set of
interviews, the overarching goal is to obtain accurate, reliable, and valid
information. Psychometric concepts of most relevance to the general clinical
interview are <i>content validity, temporal (test-retest) reliability, accuracy</i>
(White &amp; Edelstein, 1991), and <i>incremental validity</i>. A content-valid interview
must contain questions that elicit information regarding all of the
behavioral, cognitive, affective, historical, and social factors that are relevant
to the problem(s) under consideration.


Temporal reliability is determined by the extent to which the data obtained at
one point in time are consistent with that obtained at another point in time. One
must assume, of course, that what is being measured has some temporal reliability
or stability over time. In contrast, one cannot expect measures of mental status,
physical activity, or mood to be temporally reliable for individuals whose mental
and physical status varies significantly over time. One might expect great temporal
stability of personality, person preferences, and intellectual variables.
Consequently, the temporal reliability of an interview must be considered in the
context of the stability of phenomena under examination.


The accuracy of an assessment instrument has also been termed <i>internal
validity</i> (Haynes, 1991) and <i>sensitivity</i> (Cone, 1981, 1988; Haynes, 1991). The
accuracy of an interview (the assessment instrument) is determined by the
precision with which it captures the important qualities of clients' behaviors. If
one is to assess the accuracy of an interview, it must have well-articulated rules
for its use and agreed-on criteria by which to judge the data obtained. It is
unfortunate that, with the exception of some very structured interviews, no
agreed-on rules and procedures exist for conducting an initial interview.


Incremental validity refers to the increase in validity of information when
new information is added to existing data (e.g., biographical information,
results of testing). One might ask whether the validity of the assessment is
increased when the interview information is added to that obtained via other

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY OF
SELF-REPORTS BY OLDER ADULTS


Self-reports are subject to the same environmental influences as other verbal
behavior. They are shaped by the reinforcement contingencies operative in the

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The accuracy of self-reports may also be influenced by increases in cognitive
impairment, as one might expect. Clients with severe dementia may not
be able to comprehend questions or the nature of requested information. Older
adults with dementia who deny memory loss also tend to deny the presence
of other symptoms (Feher, Larrabee, &amp; Crook, 1992). Feher et al. (1992)
assert that accurate self-reporting of recent mood requires only minimal
memory ability, suggesting that individuals with mild to moderate dementia
can be accurate in responding to questions requiring minimal memory ability.


Response sets can influence responses to questions with older adults, much
as they can with younger adults. However, there are some reported response
biases that may be even more characteristic of older adults. Older adults may tend
to be more cautious (Okun, 1976) and experience greater anxiety than younger
adults regarding receipt of negative feedback and engage in risk-avoiding behavior
when anticipating evaluative information (Poon, Rubin, &amp; Wilson, 1986).
Older adults are more likely than younger adults to respond to questions in a
socially desirable fashion (Campbell, Converse, &amp; Rodgers, 1976). Chronically
ill older adults are also more likely than younger adults to skip questions
when responding to questionnaires (Sherbourne &amp; Meredith, 1992).


Accuracy of self-reported estimates of functional ability has been questioned
by researchers although the findings are mixed. Myers and Huddy
(1985) found that institutionalized older adults inaccurately reported current
activities of daily living (ADL), physical ability, and estimates of functional
capabilities in activities they no longer performed. Sager et al. (1992) found
that older adults both under and overestimated their abilities to complete
ADLs compared to performance-based measures. Rubenstein, Schairer, Weiland,
and Kane (1984) supported at least some of the Sager et al. (1992) findings
in their study where geriatric patients overestimated their functional ability.
Last, Sager et al. (1992) found that self-reported ADLs performed in home
settings were accurate when compared with more objective measures.


The accuracy of older adults' self-reports of memory impairment has also
been questioned (e.g., Perlmutter, 1978; Rabbitt, 1982; Sunderland, Watts,

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Linguistic and semantic differences between generations (Kaszniak, 1990),
genders, and ethnicity must be considered when evaluating responses to
interview questions. Differences in what is considered socially desirable
across generations may yield differences in responses to questions. For
example, older adults often respond with less frankness to questions regarding
sexuality than do younger adults (Yesavage, 1986).


RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY
OF REPORTS BY OTHERS


Staff, family members, and other individuals can be rich sources of primary
and supplementary information. Reports by others are particularly helpful
when the client is denying information suspected to be true, apparently
overreporting symptoms, refusing to talk with a stranger (the interviewer), or
unable to participate fully in the interview due to cognitive or physical
impairment. The limitations and threats to accuracy and reliability are similar
to those of self-reporting and direct observation. In addition, when multiple
reports are involved, there is always the issue of which report constitutes the
incontrovertible standard. The reliability and accuracy of such reports have
been investigated with a variety of informants across a spectrum of content
areas, yielding a mixture of findings.


Rubenstein et al. (1984) found that accuracy of functional status was greater
with reports from a child, a relative, or a friend than with reports from a
spouse. They also found that nurses and community proxies tended to rate
patients as more dysfunctional than suggested by more objective indices.


Silverman, Breitner, Mohs, and Davis (1986) found high levels of agreement
between multiple informants from the same family when reporting the
time of dementia onset for a relative. Similarly, Kukull and Larson (1989)
found that retrospective accounts of the symptoms of dementia could be
recalled by close relatives of a deceased patient over an average of 2.9 years
with reasonable accuracy, although the specificity for symptoms of primary
degenerative dementia was only modest.


Last, LaRue, Watson, and Plotkin (1992) examined the reliability of relatives'
accounts of dementia symptoms by comparing current reports with
those obtained retrospectively. Moderately reliable correlations were obtained
between retrospective and initial ratings by relatives over a period of
a few months. Relatives recalled patients having fewer psychiatric symptoms
in their retrospective accounts when compared with the initial reports, however.

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Though there is evidence from the foregoing studies that reports by others
can be accurate, sufficient evidence exists to warrant caution when using only
single-source reports regarding the behavior of the client. Perhaps the best
model of information gathering is one that includes as many sources as
possible so that a convergence of information is accumulated.


<b>Interview Structure</b>


Interviews vary in their structure and function from completely unstructured,
free flowing conversations to carefully sequenced and branching questions
leading to psychiatric diagnoses. At one end are the highly structured adult
diagnostic interview schedules, which specify all questions and probes to be used
and may include a response classification or symptom-scoring system by which
to rate the client's responses. Diagnostic interview schedules are typically characterized
by (a) a list of questions, behaviors, symptoms, and areas of inquiry, (b)
a procedure or set of rules for conducting the interview, and (c) a procedure or
rules for recording or rating the client's responses (Edelstein, Alberts, &amp; Estill,
1988). Less structured interview schedules provide statements, probes, or outlines
for questioning at the option of the interviewer. As interviews decrease in
structure, they also tend to increase in the amount of skill and clinical inference
required of the interviewer.


We lack sufficient space to cover all available interviews of relevance to
older adults or even those developed specifically for older adults. Consequently,
a few representative interviews will be briefly discussed for illustrative
purposes. Diagnostic and more general structured interviews will be
described first, followed by mental status examinations developed as cognitive
screening instruments.


STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS


The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID; Spitzer et al.,
1992) is an example of a semistructured diagnostic interview developed for a
wide range of age groups and that may be used with older adults. The structure
of the SCID allows several diagnostic hypotheses to be tested successively,
with items grouped by diagnosis and criteria. For economy of time, a branching
system allows the interviewer to skip items that are of no diagnostic

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS; Copeland et al., 1976) is a
semistructured interview for examining the mental state of older adults. The
GMS comprises items from the eighth edition of the Present State Examination
(Wing, Birley, Cooper, Graham, &amp; Isaacs, 1967) and the Present Status
Schedule (Spitzer, Fleiss, Burdock, &amp; Hardesty, 1964). The authors established
good reliability among trained raters, recommending that a person undertake 20
joint interviews with an instructor to establish adequate reliability.


The GMS formed the backbone for the psychiatric section of the Comprehensive
Assessment and Referral Evaluation (CARE; Gurland et al., 1977-78).
In constructing CARE, the GMS items were rewritten in a simplified
form. Additional items were also added from a variety of other instruments
to create a new one that addresses physical, social, and mental functioning of
community-dwelling individuals. CARE comprises 22 scales with 314 items.
According to Gurland and Wilder (1984), it permits one to determine
<blockquote>
<p>
(a) the presence and severity of specific psychiatric, physical or social/environmental
problems, (b) their etiological associations, (c) the severity of their
personal or social effects, (d) the availability of assets and supports to the
individual, (e) the effects of problems on the use of supports and services, (f) the
changes that occur in problems over time, and (g) whether the person is at risk for
developing new problems, or for deterioration, institutionalization or death.
(p. 130)
</p>
</blockquote>
The authors have reported good interrater reliability, internal consistency,
concurrent validity, and predictive validity (Teresi, Golden, &amp; Gurland,
1984). The SHORT-CARE is a briefer version of CARE that measures three
content areas--depression, dementia, and disability--with good interrater
reliability and internal consistency. It contains 143 items that form 6 of the
22 indicator scales from CARE.


(a) the presence and severity of specific psychiatric, physical or social/environmental
problems, (b) their etiological associations, (c) the severity of their
personal or social effects, (d) the availability of assets and supports to the
individual, (e) the effects of problems on the use of supports and services, (f) the
changes that occur in problems over time, and (g) whether the person is at risk for
developing new problems, or for deterioration, institutionalization or death.
(p. 130)


The Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination (CAMDEX;
Roth et al., 1986) is another example of a multielement assessment instrument
that includes an interview component. It comprises three sections: (a) a
structured clinical interview for obtaining family history and present and past

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Each of the foregoing interviews can be of benefit to the clinician. The
advantages of such interviews are that they force one to consider issues and
factors that might be overlooked if one were interviewing in an unstructured
fashion and that they can lead to more reliable conclusions than one might
reach with less structure. Structured interviews can serve as excellent guides
for students and less experienced clinicians. The principal disadvantages of
structured and semistructured interviews are the significant amounts of time
and training required to administer them.


MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATIONS


The mental status examination (MSE) is typically a semistructured interview
that may also contain other performance measures (e.g., figure drawing).
MSEs vary in depth and breadth of coverage. Content extends from minimal
coverage of cognitive functioning (e.g., cognitive screening instruments)
requiring only 10 minutes for assessment to more comprehensive coverage of
cognitive and psychodiagnostic status requiring over an hour. The comprehensiveness
of the MSE one employs is often a function of the question at
hand, the sophistication and training of the examiner, and the setting (e.g.,
bedside, examination room, office) in which the examination is to be conducted.
Results of the MSE can form the basis for more extensive assessment
or the decision to forego standard assessment procedures due to the level of
functioning of the client. The MSE can also serve as a pretest for cognitive
status, permitting periodic reexamination that enables one to track the general
mental status of an individual throughout the course of progressive dementia,
before and after surgery, and so forth. Though the MSE has much to recommend
it, it is limited by the cognitive-language status of the individual being
interviewed. Moreover, the reliability of the MSE can vary with the amount
of structure and standardization. Standardized administration and scoring
procedures exist for a variety of the briefer cognitive screening instruments
that fall under the rubric of MSEs. However, few of the more comprehensive
MSEs are available in standardized form (i.e., with normative data, standard
instructions, standard scoring procedures).


Cognitive screening instruments typically have been developed for detecting
moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The advantages of such instruments

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As with structured interviews, detailed discussion of the mental status
examination is beyond the scope of this chapter. The interested reader is
referred to Strub and Black's (1993) very thorough discussion of the mental
status examination in neurology, Hodges's (1994) excellent coverage of
cognitive assessment, and Mandell, Knoefel, and Albert's (1994) MSE for use
with older adults. Albert (1994) has also provided a relatively complete
analysis of the more popular brief cognitive screening instruments. For
illustrative purposes, three different types of MSEs will be briefly described:
one for general screening, one for screening of severely impaired individuals,
and one for administration over the telephone.


Of the brief mental status examinations, the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) is probably the most widely used (Albert,
1994) and requires only approximately 10 minutes to administer. Domains
assessed include memory, language, spatial ability, and set shifting. The
MMSE has good 24-hour test-retest reliability (<i>r</i> = .83 to .89; Folstein et al.,
1975). Sensitivity has been estimated to be 83% with individuals with moderate
to severe dementia. Little training is required to administer the MMSE.
Scores of 23 or lower are considered indicative of cognitive impairment,
although higher and lower cutoffs have been established for individuals with
multiple sclerosis (Beaty &amp; Goodkin, 1990), lower education (Anthony,
LeResche, Niaz, Von Korff, &amp; Folstein, 1982) and different ages (Bleecker,
Bolla-Wilson, Kawas, &amp; Agnew, 1988).


The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) (Saxton, McGonigle-Gibson, Swihart,
Miller, &amp; Boller, 1990), which requires 20+ minutes to administer, offers
an alternative to the MMSE and other brief assessment instruments for
individuals whose severe cognitive impairment can yield a floor effect with
other screening measures. The SIB measures six domains: attention, orientation,
language, memory, visuoperception, and construction. Social skills and
praxis are also assessed in a very limited fashion. Scores, which range from
0 to 152, are correlated with those of the MMSE (<i>r</i> = .74) and have shown
good stability over time (<i>r</i> = .85).


The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS; Brandt, Spencer, &amp;
Folstein, 1988) is an 11-item, telephone-administered test of cognitive status
designed primarily with an eye to research. The instrument requires approximately
10 minutes to administer and taps the following dimensions: orientation,
immediate recall, information, language, concentration and set shifting,

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All of the foregoing assessment instruments can be helpful in the assessment
of older adults although none is without limitations. Scores on the
cognitive screening instruments are subject to influence by age, education,
severity of cognitive deficit, location of focal cognitive deficits, racial background
(Albert, 1994), physical condition, and familiarity of the assessor with
test administration. Moreover, with the possible exception of the Strub and
Black (1993) MSE, none of the other measures should be construed as
providing a thorough evaluation of cognitive functioning. On the more positive
side, scores on these instruments provide convenient means for quantifying
the general cognitive status of individuals and baselines against which
cognitive function can be repeatedly compared. They also function as screening
instruments to alert the examiner to a need for more thorough cognitive
testing, neurological evaluation, or both.


<b>Interview Process</b>


Little empirical support exists to guide the unstructured interview process.
Much of the interview behavior of experienced clinicians is guided by repeated
reflection on what has and has not worked in similar contexts and by moment-to-moment
changes in the client's behavior. Both the client and the clinician bring
histories of interactions to the clinical setting that influence at least their initial
responses to each other. As the interview progresses, client and therapist exert
reciprocal control over each other's behavior in a cybernetic fashion (e.g.,
Edelstein &amp; Berler, 1987; Edelstein &amp; Yoman, 1991). There are a variety of paths
to successful interviews; no particular approach has been demonstrated to be most
effective, particularly for unstructured interviews.


The initial element of an interview is establishment of rapport or a therapeutic
relationship. The therapeutic relationship may be conceptualized as the
collaboration between client and clinician in the interview tasks (cf. Frieswyk
et al., 1986). Therefore, one can view the function of the relationship in the
interview as the facilitation of the assessment process. The goal of the
clinician is to gain the collaboration of the client and ultimately arrive at a
reliable and valid analysis.


It is difficult to imagine the interview progressing without certain client
collaborative behaviors (e.g, self-disclosure). Gaining the collaboration of the

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CLIENT ROLE BEHAVIOR


The client's goal is to obtain professional services and not other personal
or intimate contacts from the clinician (Zwick &amp; Attkisson, 1984; Kanfer &amp;
Schefft, 1988). The client is expected to participate actively and collaboratively
(Orne &amp; Wender, 1968; Heitler, 1976). This can be accomplished by
sharing responsibility with the clinician for the interview process (Kanfer &amp;
Schefft, 1988). This sharing includes the client stating personal goals and
wishes, reporting concerns and complaints pertaining to a presenting problem,
making decisions about the scope and course of treatment if needed, and
openly discussing concerns about the treatment and clinician (Orne &amp; Wender,
1968; Strupp &amp; Bloxom, 1973; Zwick &amp; Attkisson, 1984). Discussion of
treatment concerns may involve disagreeing with the clinician and making
specific requests. The client can also participate actively by offering his or
her own problem solutions rather than seeking advice from the clinician (Orne
&amp; Wender, 1968; Zwick &amp; Attkisson, 1984). Similarly, the client may
generate consequences and value judgments for personal courses of action
rather than eliciting them from the clinician.


The client must self-disclose to participate effectively in the interview
(Kanfer &amp; Schefft, 1988; Orne &amp; Wender, 1968; Strupp &amp; Bloxom, 1973;
Zwick &amp; Attkisson, 1984). This may entail tolerating discomfort, strong
emotional reactions, or both from the content disclosed. Clients also learn to
take responsibility for their problems in living (cf. Strupp &amp; Bloxom, 1973)
by discussing problems in terms of their own behavior. Self-disclosure,
particularly of sensitive information, requires trust. Indeed, the client's perception
that the therapist is trustworthy has been noted to be one of the most
critical features of effective helping relationships (e.g., Cormier &amp; Cormier,
1991).


Though no agreement exists as to what constitutes trustworthy behavior,
Alberts (1991) has gleaned five classes of therapist behavior from the literature
on client trust that various authors have argued convey a sense of trust to
the client. These are
<blockquote>
<p>
(a) That the therapist is genuinely concerned about the welfare of the client and
is motivated solely by this concern to benefit the client, (b) that the therapist
</p><p>[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
respects and does not judge the client despite the client's present inability to adjust
to demands of his/her life circumstance, (c) that the therapist is understanding and
comprehends the nature of the client's concerns and needs, (d) that the therapist
credibly communicates his/her capacity to assist the client in improving his/her
situation and is optimistic about a positive outcome, and (e) that the therapist is
honest, reliable, and can be depended on to do what he/she says. (pp. 11-12)
</blockquote>

(a) That the therapist is genuinely concerned about the welfare of the client and
is motivated solely by this concern to benefit the client, (b) that the therapist

When the therapist first sees me, he or she generally smiles and is warm. +


The therapist makes decisions that affect me without asking for my input. -


The therapist holds his or her eye contact when talking to me. +


The therapist remembers and brings up things that I have talked about before. +


If something is bothering me, the therapist lets me talk about it and get it off my
chest. +


The therapist takes time to think about the things I say before answering me. +


The therapist indicates that he or she won't judge me or criticize me no matter what
I say. +


The therapist indicates that he or she respects me despite the problems I have. +


The therapist talks so much that I don't get a chance to say as much as I would like. -


The therapist gives me wrong information. -


The therapist is easily distracted and loses his or her train of thought. -


The therapist hurries our conversations along as if he or she was impatient with me. -


The therapist misstates things that I have said. -


The therapist indicates that my concerns or problems are silly. -


The therapist tells me his or her view of my problems and what it will take for me
to feel better. +


The therapist gives me advice or suggestions about how to deal with my problems. +


The therapist indicates that I should ask questions if what he or she says is not clear. +


The therapist tells me what I should do if I need help in an emergency. +


The therapist indicates that for therapy to work, we need to trust each other. +


Use of the positively valenced behaviors and avoidance of the negatively
valenced behaviors should increase the likelihood that the clinician will gain

<i>Shaping Client Role Behavior</i>


The first step in accomplishing this is for the clinician to recognize that the
interview process is one of mutual influence between the clinician and the
client (Cormier &amp; Cormier, 1991; Edelstein &amp; Berler, 1987; Ferster, 1979).
As Ferster (1979) noted, "the patient's speech is sustained by the way it
influences the therapist" (p. 30). The clinician, therefore, must regulate his or
her reactions to the client's verbal behavior to influence that behavior. Among
the implications of this are that the clinician's listening responses, empathic
responses, and statements of positive regard are made contingently and not
unconditionally (Hamilton, 1988). For example, the clinician may cease
minimal verbal responses (e.g., "uh huh," "good") when a client perseverates
in describing a past event to the exclusion of a current topic of more immediate
importance. An overriding concern in this endeavor is to keep the interview
sufficiently reinforcing for the client to continue to participate collaboratively
in the interview (Edelstein &amp; Yoman, 1991).


<i>Listening Behavior</i>


If the interview requires reciprocation, then listening is an essential ingredient
of the clinician's repertoire. Potter (as quoted in Cormier &amp; Cormier,
1991) said, "Listening is the other half of talking. Listening well is no less
important than speaking well and it is probably more difficult." Four important
listening responses that the clinician may find effective for a variety of
functions are <i>clarification, paraphrasing, reflection</i>, and <i>summarization</i>
(Cormier &amp; Cormier, 1991).


<i>Clarification</i>. This involves questioning the client regarding the content of
a recent response. It is used to encourage clients to elaborate on what has been
said, establish the accuracy of what one has heard, or to clarify confusing
statements (e.g., "Are you saying that you don't know how you are going to
face your responsibilities now that you have lost the ability to get around
without assistance?").


<i>Paraphrasing</i>. This involves rephrasing the content of a client's message and
is used to help the client focus on the content of the message or to focus on
content rather than affect.


<i>Reflection</i>. This involves rephrasing the affective component of the client's
statement(s). Reflection is used to encourage clients to express affect, express

<i>Summarization</i>. This involves two or more paraphrases or reflections that
pull together statements the client has made over a period of time. In addition
to distilling the client's statements, summarization can also be used to identify
a common theme or pattern, interrupt excessive rambling, or review the
progress of the interview session (Cormier &amp; Cormier, 1991).


The following vignette will be used to illustrate each of these listening responses:
<blockquote>
<p>
An 80-year-old woman recently lost her husband to an unanticipated heart attack,
leaving her at home alone to dwell on his loss and to struggle with the many daily
tasks that her husband performed independently of her. She states, "I don't know
what I am going to do now. My whole life centered around my husband. I never
was much good at handling our financial affairs or taking care of little problems
that occurred. I can't sleep, I can't concentrate, and I don't know where to begin
with making sense of our financial situation."
</p>
<p>
<i>Clarification</i>--"Are you saying that you are having a difficult time not only dealing
with the loss of your husband but also dealing with all the financial and other
affairs that he handled all those years?"
</p>
<p>
<i>Paraphrasing</i>--"You seem to have lost the most important element of your life and
are having trouble knowing how to deal with that loss and with all your new
responsibilities that were previously handled by your husband."
</p>
<p>
<i>Reflection</i>--"You seem to be feeling anxiety and despair over how to cope with the
loss of your husband and the assumption of his responsibilities."
</p>
<p>
<i>Summarization</i>--"Let me see if I can pull together what you have just discussed with
me. With the loss of your husband, you are experiencing emotional problems
associated with his loss and some very immediate practical problems associated
with everyday affairs and your need to assume his financial responsibilities."

<b>Interview Stress</b>


Be mindful that the assessment interview can be a very stressful undertaking
for an older adult for a variety of reasons. A few of these might be the

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Anxiety reduction can be accomplished in a variety of manners. The
clinician can begin by informing the client that he or she will be asking many
questions, some of which may seem to be unrelated to each other. The client
can be encouraged to stop the clinician at any time to ask questions about the
interview in general or about individual questions. Merely informing the
client of his or her role in the interview process can often alleviate some
anxiety. Apprehensiveness or anxiety can be reduced by telling the client that
some of the questions will be more difficult than others, that he or she should
not to worry if all the questions are not answered correctly, and (when true)
that there are no right or wrong answers. When a client fails to correctly
answer or provide an answer to a standardized assessment question, one can
often obtain relevant information and reduce some of the client's concern over
failure by asking related questions that address much of the same content but
without the difficulty or complexity of the standardized questions.


A client's overall relaxed state can be attained through relaxation techniques
(e.g., diaphragmatic breathing). This state can be paired with successively
more threatening aspects of the interview (Edelstein &amp; Yoman, 1991).
Exposure techniques can also be used to increase the likelihood that the client
will continue despite growing anxiety. For example, when the client changes
the topic from a difficult problem to an off-task one, the clinician might
persistently but supportively bring the client back on task until the problem
topic had been thoroughly discussed.


Perhaps the best advice for the novice or less experienced clinician is to
treat the interview as a situation in which problems can arise and interventions
can be employed. Anxiety, for example, can be addressed in the context of
the interview in much the same fashion as it would be with a client seeking
help for anxiety. Similarly, problem-solving techniques are just as effective
with interview process problems as they are with the presenting problems of
clients. The clinician's goal is to develop a collaborative relationship with the
client and obtain information necessary for making decisions. Forays into
brief interventions during the interview process can often turn an apparently
hopeless interview into a very productive and lasting relationship.

Although the foregoing process strategies can be very effective, one's
efficiency and effectiveness will also rest on an appreciation of one's own
biases that are brought to the interview setting.


<b>Interview Biases: The Example of Ageism</b>


Perhaps the most important of the potential biases that one can bring to the
older-adult interview is <i>ageism</i>. The term was first described by Butler (1969)
as the system of false assumptions and beliefs regarding older adults. Ageism
includes socially accepted negative attitudes, erroneous beliefs, stereotypes,
and discriminatory behaviors and practices toward older adults (Rodeheaver,
1990). Lack of knowledge about older adults can produce such a set of false
beliefs, which can profoundly influence behavior toward older adults. Among
the false beliefs are the following:
<blockquote>
<p>
(1) Aging brings an end to productivity; (2) The aged naturally desire to disengage
from society; (3) Older people are inflexible, set in their ways; (4) Senility is a
normal part of aging; and (5) The aged are (or should be) serene and accepting of
these changes. (Rodeheaver, 1990, p. 7.1-7.2)
</p>
</blockquote>
Ageism can influence the behavior of the clinician by encouraging discriminatory
practices and fostering a higher recall of negative traits than of positive
ones (Perdue &amp; Gurtman, 1990). Moreover, Dupree and Patterson (1985)
argue thusly:
<blockquote>
<p>
Views associated with professional ageism (particularly those noting that mental
illness in old age is inevitable, untreatable, disabling, and irreversible) become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to a lack of prevention and treatment, which in
turn tends to confirm the original belief. (p. 10)
</p>
</blockquote>
Problems of older adults may be incorrectly labeled as senility, and the
psychosocial concerns of older adults may be minimized or discussed less
(Greene, Adelman, Charon, &amp; Hoffman, 1986). These problems in professional
ageism are compounded in older women because of sexism and the
tendency to view them stereotypically as sick and alone. Investigators have
noted that clinicians working with older adults tend to dominate the interview,
are less respectful, less patient, and less engaged (Greene et al., 1986).
Likewise, mental health professionals recommend drugs more frequently than
psychotherapy and give poorer prognoses to older as compared to younger
patients (Gatz &amp; Pearson, 1988).


(1) Aging brings an end to productivity; (2) The aged naturally desire to disengage
from society; (3) Older people are inflexible, set in their ways; (4) Senility is a
normal part of aging; and (5) The aged are (or should be) serene and accepting of
these changes. (Rodeheaver, 1990, p. 7.1-7.2)


Views associated with professional ageism (particularly those noting that mental
illness in old age is inevitable, untreatable, disabling, and irreversible) become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to a lack of prevention and treatment, which in
turn tends to confirm the original belief. (p. 10)


Suggestions for clinicians to employ to prevent the negative effect of
ageism on the interview process include learning about the aging process,

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The foregoing recommendations should be complemented by knowledge
of how physical changes sometimes associated with aging can influence the
interview process. Knowledge and consideration of these factors can determine
whether one achieves a successful interview or an incomplete or compromised
one.


<b>Physical Changes and Problems</b>


During the initial interview, any physical problems of the client that might
require further investigation or that could compromise the adequacy of the
interview should be considered. Past medical history and present physical
status should be considered and a current inventory of prescribed medications
reviewed. In particular, sensory domains should be evaluated early in the
interview.


HEARING


Hearing loss is a frequent problem among older adults and is more prevalent
in men than in women. It has been estimated that more than 50% of the 27
million Americans over age 65 are affected by hearing impairment (Pfeifer,
1980; Vernon, 1989). Accordingly, health professionals should be aware of
clues to possible hearing impairment: a history of ear infections, loud speech,
requests for the clinician to repeat statements, the inability to distinguish
figure-ground sounds in a group, and the tendency to watch a speaker's mouth
intently (Vernon, 1989).


As the amount of background noise increases, older adults with hearing
problems are particularly affected. This phenomenon, known as <i>masking</i>,
highlights the need to minimize ambient background noise when interviewing
older adults (Storandt, 1994). Hearing difficulties also increase at higher tone
frequencies; therefore, older adults may experience difficulty distinguishing
certain consonants (Ordy, Brizzee, Beavers, &amp; Medart, 1979). Female clinicians
with high-pitched voices should be sensitive to the fact that difficulty
in hearing high frequencies may pose special communication problems with
older adults and may need to consider lowering the pitch of their voices
(Storandt, 1994). Causes of hearing deficits include presbycusis (loss of

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Further communication problems may result as individuals with hearing
loss pretend to understand what is being said during the interview. More
critical consequences of hearing loss include denial (Vernon, Griffin, &amp;
Yoken, 1981), isolation (Vernon, 1989), depression (Solomon, 1982), misleading
diagnoses (Mindel &amp; Vernon, 1987), and paranoid reactions (Zimbardo,
Anderson, &amp; Kabat, 1981).


<i>Practical Recommendations</i>


Interview the client in a quiet setting and minimize distractions; do not attempt
to compete with background noise. Behaviors that interfere with lipreading
include exaggerated or rapid speech, poor lighting, and anything that covers the
speaker's mouth (e.g., pencil, gum, moustache). Make certain there is good
lighting on your face. Sit facing the client so that he or she can take advantage of
your facial expressions. Speak slowly and distinctly. Do not overexaggerate your
mouth movements. Use facial expressions to emphasize a point. Try not to
exaggerate speech or speak too loudly, as this will distort speech. Take frequent
breaks if the client is having to read your lips to completely understand your
questions. Such a task is demanding for an older hearing-impaired person.


If you determine that the client cannot understand you using a face-to-face
seating arrangement and you have reason to believe that the client has better
hearing in one ear than another, you might attempt to talk directly into the
good ear or offer the client a sound amplification device. Such devices are
now inexpensive and readily available. Last, be aware of neutral responses
and head nodding, and if necessary, turn to written communication.


Edelstein, Northrop, Staats, &amp; Packard (1996) have offered the following
additional recommendations with regard to hearing-impaired individuals:
<blockquote>
<p>
Do not necessarily rely on the results of audiograms obtained in quiet environments
if one is really interested in an examinee's ability to comprehend the examiner's
speech. A hearing (speech perception) check should ideally be performed under
the conditions of assessment and perhaps in public settings if hearing is suspected
of contributing to psychosocial problems.
</p>
<p>
Do not overarticulate, which can distort speech and facial gestures.
</p>
<p>
Be vigilant for selective (i.e., functional) hearing impairment characterized by
hearing losses associated with task demands, poor motivation, and perhaps fear
of performance failure.
</p>
<p>
Failure to answer a question could result from, among other things, failure to hear
or inability to understand (comprehend) the question.
</p>

VISION


Although 80% of older adults have fair to adequate vision (Pfeifer, 1980), many
of those with visual problems have partial blindness, are unemployed, and are
women. Types of common visual impairments include decreases in visual acuity,
depth perception, peripheral vision, adaptation to light change, tolerance for glare,
accommodation, convergence, and ability to look up (Heckheimer, 1989). Cataract,
or clouding of the lens of the eye, is another common problem among older
adults that can cause problems with glare in brightly lit areas.


Most individuals with significant visual impairment rely on methods of
communication such as tape cassettes and lipreading (Shindell, 1989). The
majority of such individuals are not completely blind and do not use braille.


<i>Practical Recommendations</i>


Visually impaired older adults may have trouble with nonverbal communication
such as facial expressions. Do not assume individuals with visual problems
are hard of hearing. Ask for permission before giving physical assistance. When
offering physical guidance to an interview setting, give specific suggestions for
guiding, determine whether the client has a preference, or both. Place the visually
impaired person's hand on your arm just above the elbow. Lead but do not pull
or push. Explain changes in the environment as they are encountered.


Once you begin the interview, ask about the client's preferred means of
communication. Do not assume the examinee's preferred means of communication.
Ask the client to describe their vision problem or any idiosyncrasies
involving color, contrast, or field deficits (Shindell, 1989). Ask the examinee to
describe any problems with lighting in the assessment room such as glare or
insufficient lighting. If glare is a potential problem, make sure that the interview
setting is sufficiently illuminated without being so bright as to cause unnecessary
glare (Storandt, 1994). Avoid using high-gloss paper for self-report inventories,
visual aids, and figure-drawing tasks. Limit nonverbal directions, rely more
heavily on verbal or kinesthetic cueing (Shindell, 1989), and use multimodal (say
and do) directions when possible. Last, be careful when interpreting the behavior
of severely visually impaired examinees. For example, the examinee may arrive
early for an assessment session or have rigid scheduling requirements that may
be more a function of available transportation than resistance (Shindell, 1989).


MOTOR DISORDERS


Motor-impaired older adults have their own set of distinctive psychological
circumstances requiring knowledge and understanding. One must consider the

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Practical Recommendations</i>


The clinician may have to modify interview procedures depending on the
particular motor or perceptual-motor problems presented by the client. For
example, some physically disabled individuals may tire easily. The clinician
may want to schedule rest periods or use several short interview sessions
(Storandt, 1994; Storandt, Siegler, &amp; Elias, 1978). In another case, a client
may exhibit a severe speech impairment resulting from a stroke. To adjust for
this problem, the clinician may ask the client to write answers to questions.
If the client is unable to respond verbally or in writing, questions may be posed
in such a way that only a nod of "yes" or "no" is required.


COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IMPAIRMENT


Memory loss is the most common complaint of the aged (Schear, 1984).
Normal aging involves some complaints of memory loss often characterized
by a mild increase in or awareness of normal forgetting. Older individuals
tend to make errors of omission rather than commission. Recall of material
with little association value suffers the most with increasing age, in contrast
to material with greater association value and tasks requiring recognition
rather than recall. Working memory also appears to suffer with increasing age
(Morris, Craik, &amp; Glick, 1990).


Some older adults may also have increasing difficulty with abstraction and
flexibility as they age (Salthouse &amp; Prill, 1987). Similarly, some older adults
may experience difficulties working with abstract concepts that require significant
attention and memory demands (e.g., Hess &amp; Slaughter, 1986).


<i>Practical Recommendations</i>


Cognitively impaired individuals can find an interview particularly difficult
and frustrating, leading to fatigue and confusion. Cueing can help with
the encoding and retrieval process when questioning older adults with some
apparent memory impairment. One may also follow open-ended questions
with multiple-choice questions to assist an individual who experiences recall

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The clinician should pace the interview so that the client is given the
opportunity to provide complete information. Good active listening skills
(e.g., reflecting, summarizing) can often be helpful when the client experiences
difficulty responding to questions in a reasonable amount of time. Most
important, the clinician must be patient and careful not to rush through an
interview (Pfeifer, 1980; Storandt, 1994; Zeiss, 1992).


<b>Conclusion</b>


The clinical interview can be a very effective method for obtaining information
from older adults and significant others. Though it has significant
limitations in its most unstructured form, it also affords the clinician the
opportunity to engage in an interactive, iterative process of hypothesis testing.
The interview can be a rich source of information, but its limitations must be
considered because conclusions are drawn from it and other assessment
methods.
