<font size="4"><b>He's Soooo Creative</b></font>

Yeah, that's what my mom always said. I guess she could've been
right about the guy, I mean, what the fuck did I know? I was only
about six or seven. He smiled, he entertained, he mocked his brother,
all the while dressed in suits that Elton John would rip off twenty
years later. She watched him with a reverence I felt so lacking in my
life, from anyone. She'd try valiantly (yet carelessly at the same time)
to make a tasty egg-salad sandwich for me, always with the brand of
mayonnaise I hated, while digging Liberace on the tube with one eye,
and half watching herself ruin the wretched meal with the other.

Quite frankly, all I expected (and usually received) was that I
could get this smelly light repast without her relentless and unconditional
praise of the show (it made me jealous) or, God forbid, any
small talk that would serve only to make me feel smaller. So after
scoring the imitation prison food I would quickly skulk down to the
basement, where we had the big TV set that resembled a monitor
from outer space in a bad Japanese sci-fi flick, remarkable at the
time because it supposedly didn't need rabbit ears, the antennas for
better reception, hurrying so as to not miss the beginning of a movie
that was to have a profound impact on my life.


<i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i> was going to be on again in a few minutes,
on this cool show, <i>Million Dollar Movie</i>, which oddly enough, on
some weeks, played one movie three times a day. And since this was
my week off from school, I'd planned to watch Cagney twentyseven
times. No one seemed to care because no one seemed to be
home. Even when they were home, everyone was in their own
<i>world</i>, as far back as I can remember. Even the Mohel who <i>did me</i> at
my briss (I seem to recall with horror) was not only trying to cut my
dick off, but chanting beautifully <i>at the same time</i>, almost as if he was
cutting a demo to get on some hot, new Yiddish recording label. If
that was an early feeling of being castrated, what fun for my shrinks
all these years.


I think the thing that somehow hooked me, while in a trance,
after watching that film for days on end, thinking of not much else,
was just how impenetrable George M. Cohan seemed to be as he
worked with such blind integrity for what he wanted. I just loved
how hard he tried to score and be authentic. <i>I just loved him for that</i>.
Little did I know (while stuffing Mallomars down my throat at an
alarming rate) that not only would I one day grew up and discover
that I was an alcoholic, workaholic, and had an eating disorder for
good measure, but that everything in my life was going to become
secondary to having someone think that I was <i>socoo creative</i>.


And I almost paid for it with my life but, wahoo, here I am. And
yeah, I think I am creative. Just like that beautiful ceramics teacher
who would rove from school to school in our district twice a year.

Years later, I found myself with the nightmare of having to
become <i>sooooo creative</i> on my own. I soon realized that trying to make
a living as an artist brings with it a world of critics who force you
into a position of defending your own free will. As a young student,
my accidentally impressionistic ashtrays sucked, but van Gogh's
paintings were never sold while he was alive. Franz Kafka didn't
want any of his work published even after he died. Maybe more disheartening
from a human standpoint, Richard Lewis didn't even
think anyone would care if he created a fuckin' thing. Least of all
himself.


I slowly but surely encountered a very thin line between having
the courage to express my personal feelings for a buck, and self-destructing
under the pressure of practically everyone else around
me. They looked at me like any attempt to be <i>sooooo creative</i> was a
self-delusion. The endless lack of support and incredulity from 99.99
percent of those I knew, even those who claimed to love me, left me
questioning whether or not I had any guts, or worse, a point of view.
That sounds as trite as it was insidious and emotionally crippling.


Looking back on it now, as a full-blown, middle-aged, functioning
anxiety collector, I can admit without cringing that my parents
had their fair share of tremendous qualities, yet, being human much
of the day, had more than just a handful of flaws as well. Much to

Growing up, as far as my mind could see, <i>my</i> outlook was that
either I was always wrong and never did the right thing, or if I did, it
was either never enough or I should find some reason to hide it. I
was in a constant state of dissatisfaction. Like man, even if I just
checked into the Nirvana Hotel I'd be looking for reasons to check
out, immediately. This kind of irrational fear clouded so much of my
vision that I was virtually blinded to my own insights, even with my
20/20 eyesight and healthy brain, before I got to kindergarten.


Yup. That's why I had a need to become <i>soooco creative</i>. I had to
give birth to myself.


Talk about born-again Jews. <i>L'chaim</i>.
