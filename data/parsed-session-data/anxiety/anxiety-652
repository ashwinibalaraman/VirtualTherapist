those who've slipped,<br />

--Janelle, five years clean


A year into my last stretch of not gambling I took on an out-of-town
writing job in Washington State. I'd be working with
a wildlife biologist who knew a wilderness area better than the
wildlife did. I knew I'd have to hike in the wilderness area myself
because I write from place, and in order to occupy place I have to
have my feet solid on the ground and my nose to the wind.


I love road trips. I find leaving home terrifying. The two
facts do not override each other. I drove away from my cabin
both jittery and grateful that my research adviser in the north

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The drive took almost three days. My friend seemed to disappear
after I'd been on the road for three hours. I couldn't reach
her by phone. When I stopped for lunch, I emailed, "Hey, where
are you?" I didn't hear from her that day. I felt a little irritated,
but the sky above the Sierras was turquoise and the air so warm
I drove with my windows down, and I had time to stop at a huge
obsidian flow south of Mono Lake. I grabbed a huge turkey sandwich
at Erick Schat's in Bishop, felt the tryptophan flood my
brain, and was nothing but optimistic.


I stayed with a friend in Reno. We went out for Thai food.
She took the shortcut, smack through glittering downtown Reno.
I grabbed the dashboard. Naomi looked at me. "I am <i>so</i> sorry. I
completely forgot," she said, "Are you okay?"


I laughed. "I'm doing great for somebody who didn't just
jump out of a car going forty miles an hour."


We made it to the Thai restaurant. Naomi asked all the right
questions. I was relieved to find that I had the right answers.
When we were done eating, we drove back home the long way.


The next day the March weather went bipolar. Sleet glazed
my windshield. I knew there were winding roads ahead and a high
mountain pass. I checked into a small-town motel and Googled
the weather forecast. The pass was open, but likely to close by
dark. I checked my email. No message from my friend. No phone
call. I wanted to smack her. I looked out the motel window. A
scarlet sign glittered in the distance. CASINO.


It took one second of irritation with my friend and six big,
glowing letters a few blocks away for me to pull on my coat, grab

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The casino was a big, smoky, warehouse-style joint. The huge
room where the slots were lined up was about two-thirds empty
space, with about a tenth of the machines occupied. I was glad.
I'd managed to pump my irritation up into righteous rage. I didn't
want to make talk with anybody. I was there for the buzz and the
numb. I knew I was playing "against my friend." It's addict slang
for being furious with someone or something and gambling for
vengeance.


The slot machines were not my allies. Two and a half hours
and 500 bucks later, I slunk up to the ATM machine and thought,
<i>I'm bored</i>.


I drove back to the motel, walked to a little taqueria, bought
dinner, and settled into my room. The tacos were the real deal,
homemade, the chicken and cilantro fresh, the tortillas thick and
soft. I wolfed down the first one, then slowed down. The cilantro's
green scent cut through my crankiness. I looked at myself in
the motel minor. My addict self grinned back. She shrugged her
shoulders. "Oh well, sometimes the magic works, and sometimes
it doesn't."


As my blood sugar adjusted I realized I needed more company
than my addict's bemused self. I called my two best friends and
my trusted adviser. They listened. They each said the same thing:
"Hey, you're an addict. Do you want to go back and win back
what you lost?" When I answered, one of them said, "Okay, take
the book you brought for the trip out of your backpack, climb in

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, that's a plus," I said. "It might have taken four shrink sessions
at $125 a pop minimum, and I still might not have gotten it."


Larayne laughed. "Nice," she said, "you're still holding dementia
at bay. But I'm not going to let you get away with minimizing
going out. That'd make it too easy for you to do it again. It
wasn't a slip. It was a series of reactions and choices."


"Thanks for the pep talk," I said. "Seriously, thanks."


"One more thing," she said, "when you get to Belling-ham,
find a bunch of open meetings and get your butt to one
tomorrow."


I got lucky with my relapse. Five hundred bucks is about half my
monthly living expenses, but that five hundred didn't metastasize
into a thousand. I woke the next morning, gulped down two cups
of wan motel coffee, packed, and took myself back on the road
before I could decide to return to the casino determined to win
back what I'd lost. I stopped for breakfast in a mom 'n' pop diner
a half hour north of the casino. I was almost joyful to be hungry,
to look around the little joint and not feel pissed off at everybody
I saw--most "mornings after" in my gambling life I'd had no appetite
and despised humanity. I wrote in my journal as I waited
for my waffle and eggs. "<i>Escaped this time. Good enough for now</i>."


I drove up to my writing partner's house. I rang the bell. It
took a long time for someone to answer. Ella opened the door.
Her face was pale, her eyes red, her hair a tangle of snarls. "Come

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I unpacked. I realized I was anxious and hungry. Ella lived in a
working-class neighborhood a few blocks from downtown. I checked
on her, found her asleep, and went out for a walk. As my body and
brain relaxed, I knew I needed to tell her what had happened. All
of it. There was something about her raw honesty when she greeted
me at the door that deserved mine in return. And, I knew I needed
to eat. There's an old saying in twelve-step meetings: "Watch out
for HALT: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. If you're feeling any of
them, halt what you're doing and take care of yourself."


Ella emerged from her room that evening. I sat in the kitchen
finishing off an order of chicken enchiladas from a nearby restaurant.
"That actually looks good," she said. "I'm amazed. I figured
I'd never eat again."


"There's more on the counter," I said. "Help yourself." She
laughed. "So, what a welcome to the North Country!" She put
one enchilada on a plate, eyed it warily, made peppermint tea,
and sat down with me.


"I am so sorry," she said. "I went from perfectly normal to
doubled-up in front of the toilet in a second. All I could do for
three days was haul myself to the bathroom, drink water, and collapse
back in bed. I figured that what with you being another solo
woman, you'd be okay--and you'd understand."


It takes me a minute, but I finally say, "I'm fine. But I had a
little glitch on the way up."


She grinned. "Let me guess. I've read some of your work.
The big red sign on the Quonset hut at Spirit Lake sucked you
right in."

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It did."


Ella waved at the cupboard behind her. "If you look in there,
sister, you'll find my gin. We all gotta have a little something. I
quit. I drink. I quit. I drink. At the moment, I'm not drinking."


"There's more," I said. "I got really pissed off when I didn't
hear from you."


"I don't blame you," she said.


We put our dishes in the sink, moved into her cozy living room,
and talked for the next few hours about the battles we'd fought (and
still fight) with our compulsions. She handed me a list of AA and
NA meetings and said there was at least one GA meeting in the
area. By the time we both went off to bed, we knew each other in
the way that addicts can. I thought, as I do so often, that honesty
and fallibility were gifts. We hadn't had time or inclination for polite
chitchat. My writing partner and hostess was a new friend.


Ella took me into the wilderness area every few days. She
named the beauty I marveled at--the giant ferns and ancient red
cedar, the red-tailed hawk and the delicate lizard. I had hours of
time alone in my room to write--and to think back on my history
of relapses. From the moment I'd first set foot in the gambling therapy
group at least a decade earlier, I had never stayed clean longer
than a year. It was typical for me to get a month, two months,
<i>maybe</i> six months of not gambling under my belt and then, in a
millisecond, decide to go to the casino. I knew the statistics. I knew
that about two-thirds of recovering gamblers coming out of treatment
relapsed in the first three months. I knew that the recidivism
rate for recovering gamblers was higher than that for any other
addiction. I knew that proximity of a casino to the recovering gambler
exponentially increased the possibility that she would relapse.

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was still something unexamined about my recent relapse.
I didn't discover it until I talked to Helen a few days later.
She told me that Barb had not shown up for one meeting, then a
second. Because we have an agreement in Scheherazade's Sisters
not to "smother-love" each other, Candace waited till the third
week to call. Barb didn't answer, return the call, text, or email
back. When Candace told the group Barb seemed to have disappeared,
they all suspected what was happening.


Barb showed up for the next meeting. "She looked like a
whipped pup," Helen told me. "She said she knew what had
happened. She'd called one of her credit card companies to try
to set up smaller payments. The representative told her that
wouldn't be possible because her income was so small. Then
she went to her bank to see if she could get a loan to help out
with the payments. They told her that with her "unfortunate"
history, she couldn't get a loan--even with her golden credit record
with them. You know she's paid back almost all the money
she took from the church. That didn't count for anything with
her bank.


"So she said she just thought, <i>F-it, I'm sick of being good</i>; took
the 50 bucks she had in her purse; and went to the casino. She
lost a bundle. But she said she drove home and all she could think
was, <i>So, I still owe all that money to the credit cards, and now I've
got 56 bucks in my savings and 300 till the end of the month--and I
feel like shit. And, I know it's going to take forever for my brain to get
back to normal."</i>


"Well," I said, "Barb's not the only one. I got pissed off at
somebody and looked out my motel window and saw a casino
sign, and that was it."

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Helen snapped back. "What the hell were you doing in a
motel near a casino?"


I was so surprised by her anger that I couldn't speak. "Are you
there?" she asked.


"I am."


"Do you hate me for being such a nag?" Helen replied. "I'm
sorry, honey, it just seemed to me that you were fooling yourself."


"I'm not mad at you," I said. "It never occurred to me to
think about why, of all the towns on the way to Bellingham, I
decided to stay in the one with a casino. I think I'd planned the
whole thing from the minute I started getting mad at my friend.
I know I did."


"Well good," Helen said firmly. "What I've gone through has
got to help somebody. I'm glad it's you."


I thanked her and said, "See you in a month."


I hung up and thought about my words to Larayne: "Shit, it
might have taken four shrink sessions at $125 a pop minimum,
and I still might not have gotten it." I'm a seat-of-the-pants learner--and
a hard case--when it comes to knowing what I have to
know in order to change my behavior. I was grateful that it had
taken only 500 bucks to shed light on part of what had driven me
for the last eight to nine years of my gambling history. I was even
more grateful that I now knew what to look out for.


Some people in twelve-step recovery refer to relapse as a "slip." I
don't. Even before I did the research for this book, I had always
had hunches that when I gave in to the urge to use--be it contacting
an unavailable former lover when I'd promised myself I

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

True gambling addicts, whether they have a genetic predisposition
or not, are playing against a canny dealer with a stacked
deck. And whether The Dealer is the casinos or my own longings
for relief, vengeance, or constant excitement, there is no way for
me to win. And I often need relief.


I believe that when it comes to a relapse in a true addict, post-acute
withdrawal rules. I think of the words on the GA Victoria
website: "Reality is not a comfortable place for recovering addicts
of any sort" and "This is the phenomenon that happens when a 20
year veteran of a 12-step program goes back to his/her addiction
and leaves everyone scratching their heads in disbelief."


Robert R. Perkinson's powerful self-help guide, <i>The Gambling
Addiction Patient Workbook</i>, lists thirty-seven warning signs
that point to relapse. All of them fit with the discomfort and anhedonia
that a recovering gambler in postacute withdrawal can
experience. As I read the list, I found myself keeping count: apprehension
about well-being--check; denial--check; compulsive
attempts to impose abstinence on others--I'd tried to "cure"
every one of my friends in Flagstaff who was still using; defensiveness--check;
compulsive behavior--ha!; loneliness--90 percent
of the time; plans beginning to fail--welcome to the collapse of
the publishing world as I had known it; irritations with friends--
check and check and check.

Barb and I made it back into not gambling. Many women don't.
In the year I sat with the Scheherazade's Sisters, I listened to
a dozen or so women who hung out with us for a week, weeks,
even months, and then disappeared without a message to any of
us. Each of us understood. We all knew how insidious our addictions
were.


We've each spoken of the dozens or hundreds of times we
vowed to stop and didn't. For some those failures of willpower
were agonizing. Delfina has said more than once that it was her
shame over being unable to quit that drove her to the suicide attempt
that saved her life.


I was less guilt-ridden by my relapses, but I am at so many
levels a hippie seminarcissist. In part because of my seminarcissism,
I have no partner. My sons and daughter are grown and
independent. I refuse to be responsible for anyone other than myself,
so I never let anyone down. And, I don't gauge my worth or
another person's by wealth--in fact, my judgments fall not on
the poor, but the rich. Money had never seemed real to me, until
my acute terror during that Mojave winter. Only recently have I
begun to manage what money I have responsibly.


Being financially prudent makes me feel trapped. But, I'm
sixty-nine now with no retirement except for Social Security.
The time I spent homeless in my twenties convinced me that
there is nothing charming about bag ladies--or outlaw life on the
streets. So, it's time to grow up.


The other Sisters and I talk often about our amazement that
we aren't sitting side-by-side in front of a row of slot machines
instead of in a shabby room in an adult center. We know what
it has taken and takes to show up once a week with another

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00224&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here are a few steps a recovering addict can take to stay
away from a relapse. They fall in line with a wonderful story
that often makes the rounds of twelve-step meetings: Gal walks
down a street, falls in a hole. Next time, she walks toward same
hole, tells herself it isn't there, and falls in. Next walk down the
street, she takes the other side of the street. Finally, she chooses
another street.


GA teaches that a gambling addict cannot go near or in a
casino with impunity. I've heard a dozen times that someone who
slipped decided they'd just go into the casino to use the restroom,
get a cup of coffee, see if it still held allure. The hole was right in
front of them, and they marched straight toward it.


It is in "going down a different street" that we might find the
safest route. There are at least a dozen websites now available to
the recovering gambler who senses a relapse coming on. Their
tips for avoiding relapse can be condensed into four simple steps.
I keep a separate journal for my personal relapse notes. I've listed
these steps in my notebook and written my responses to them.
Parts of my responses are in italics here:


<b>1. Prevention</b>--when you are in strong recovery, learn your triggers
and warning signs...


<i>My most powerful triggers are boredom, anger, and euphoric recall.
My strongest warning signs are restlessness, feeling abandoned by
friends, resentment, and apprehension about my well-being</i>.



[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00225&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

7/9/09: <i>I hear people talk about how easy it is to gamble here in
Bend. Apparently, the state has lottery slot machines in bars and liquor
stores. A friend tells me there is a sign with crossed fingers on it. He
says he takes the sign to mean "Stay away</i>."


<i>As I drive around on my errands, I get glimpses of the signs and
consciously look away</i>.


<b>2. The urge hits</b>--call a sister in recovery, call a brother in
recovery, call a trusted sponsor, therapist, adviser, call the
national confidential twenty-four-hour gambling hotline,
1-800-522-4700--call <i>anybody!</i>


8/15/09: I've worked for hours. I wrap up a chapter. I want
a reward and think, Why not check into my favorite free online
slot? <i>I make myself pick up the phone and call Jackie from
my GA meeting. She's not home. I figure that's a sign to just go
ahead and play. Somehow, I remember the "hole in the street poem"
and call Nora in the Mojave. She answers. I say, "Damn, I was
kind of hoping you wouldn't pick up the phone." "Got the jones?"
she laughs</i>.


<i>I laugh and feel the jones evaporate</i>.


<b>3. Create a day</b>--one day at a time--in which there is no money
or time to gamble.


<i>5/22/09: I woke up antsy. I take all my cash except for $20 and
deposit in the bank. I take my credit cards to Larayne's house. She
agrees to hold them for me till the jones passes</i>.



[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00226&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>4. Exercise</b>--swim, go to the gym, ride your bicycle, do yoga or
Tai Chi, a martial art, a dance class, whatever will get you off
your seat and out of your head. If you can't afford a private pool
or gym, there may be a public one in your town. If you can't afford
a bicycle or yoga lessons, walk.


<i>9/4/09, 3:30 pm: The magazine hasn't sent my check yet. Yet!
I dropped my favorite old blue bowl on the kitchen tiles. I just learned
my friend in Ohio has breast cancer. The dog next door has howled for
an hour straight, as he did yesterday and the day before. All I have to
do is click on Free Slots, U.K., and I can smooth down the sandpaper
in my brain. I'll do it after I take a walk</i>.


<i>5:00 pm: As always, twenty minutes into walking, I felt my
head start to clear. I came back five minutes ago. I read my entry
from an hour and a half earlier, and the urge to play online slots seems
like a mirage</i>.


If you try everything and cannot resist, you are not alone. There
are, after all, only three kinds of gamblers:


<i>those who've slipped,<br />
those who could slip,<br />
those who could slip again</i>.

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00227&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Every one of us in recovery is in a huge circle with you. If
you have found yourself perched in front of your slot machine--
and are a stronger woman than I am--you might be able to pry
yourself off the slot machine seat and make a call to the gambling
hotline or a friend. If you can't, when you finally come home,
pick up the phone. Call a friend. Call another friend. Call the
gambling hotline in your state or the national, confidential,
twenty-four-hour hotline: 1-800-522-4700.


Hearing another voice may break the spell. Most of us will
find ourselves still in a state of intoxication for at least twenty-four
hours after we play. During that time, we think with an altered
brain. We make the same "decisions" that we do when we
are in a gambling run. If we can talk with someone long enough
to rewire at least a segment of our brain, we can begin to think
clearly.


<i>3/30/09: Escaped this time. Good enough for now. I couldn't
have stopped myself from gambling this morning if I hadn't heard the
voices of Larayne and my friends. In fact, in the old days, I would have
sat in my motel room trying to think of anything but that red sign--and
I would have most likely headed right back to wreak vengeance</i>.


I've recently gotten involved with an online gambling addiction
support group. I hit it off almost immediately with a recovering
woman in Great Britain. She was hanging on by her
fingernails and slipping frequently when we first connected. Now
she's staying clean. She wrote recently of a typical day in her
nongambling life. It is a perfect template for any addict battling
relapse:

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00228&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

... <i>it's the memory of consequences that eventually keeps us safe
once we start our recovery. It's when we forget that we are in jeopardy.
"Lest we forget"--another good mantra</i>.


<i>I scored again today by not gambling. I went through my usual
daily paces--soy cappuccino before work, roast veggies for lunch with
a walk to the bank to deposit a small cheque, then back to work--and
after work I bought some Turkish dried apricots, a Danish pastry for
my mum, a jar of organic tahini, and then traveled home</i>.


<i>The tram stopped in front of that venue for the connection with
the second tram of my journey, which takes me on the last leg close
to home. I stood in front of the venue doorway again across the road
and had no urge. It was so unlike how I was feeling most of the past
year until just a few weeks ago. I had been unable to resist crossing
the road and going inside until recently. Before then I had often been
in that spot across the road, tossing up yes or no and then promising
myself to only bet $2 or $5 and following my thoughts across the road
and through the dark doorway. At first I was true to my promises to
myself, but then sooner rather than later couldn't leave without putting
everything I had with me into the slots</i>.


<i>When I began entering those doors I cannot recall. I don't know
if it was this year or last. The important thing is I don't feel I want
to go through that door again, and it does feel firm. It seems J have a
steadfast commitment, and I would bet my bottom dollar on that. :-)
But one can never be too sure. Lest we forget</i>.


<i>When J look through those doors I think and contemplate those
experiences when I walked out after I'd gambled for hours and felt
somewhat shattered, emotionally slipping out of reality</i>...


<i>The days that followed each of my slips left me feeling uncomfortable
with myself, edgy, my focus on what was the purpose of my</i>

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387559-I00229&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is no gradual giving up for the true gambling addict.
There is only cold turkey, maybe once, maybe as many times as
it takes. And most women in gambling recovery cannot do cold
turkey alone. As I remind myself again and again--every day--I
know I can't.
