BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I could [feed him all day] (ph)...
THERAPIST: Yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: ...But he still is — he's like, "A new place. I [walk in here] (ph)..." [sound of object sliding]
THERAPIST: Right, and then people walk in and...
CLIENT: "...Then go right out." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: But it looks like you got to eat a little.
CLIENT: He did. I think enough to tide him over, so I think we'll be OK.
THERAPIST: And you can certainly — if he is hungry and you want to try to feed him and stuff...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...I'm perfectly OK with it.
CLIENT: Perfect, good.
THERAPIST: I don't know if he'll bother. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. He might not now. It is so funny. Before I...
THERAPIST: [Aside to Baby Trae] Yeah, you're very alert. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Could feed him anywhere, you know, when he was so much younger.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...And now it is a different story.
THERAPIST: Yeah, he is [just nodding] (ph).
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: There are other things that are more at play today.
CLIENT: There are, yes, lots of other things. So I guess that's good that he's so alert, but... [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: But how have you been?
CLIENT: Good. I'm feeling much better now than when [chuckles] I talked to you, I think last week, about, um — I had, like, a gum graft, it was called.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And do I think, like, I had expressed to them that I was really nervous about it and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Because I did that, they downplayed it, so I really was not anticipating...
THERAPIST: <i>Mmmm</i>.
CLIENT: ...The recovery. And just on a whim, like, I asked my mom to come down in the afternoon, after I had the procedure. [00:01:04]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like a week ahead of time, I had just said, "Would you mind coming? I think I'll be fine, but it'll just be nice to have you there."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And I was so glad she was there. And she ended up coming the next day, too, and then, thankfully, the third day, Todd could work from home. Like, I really [chuckles] was not [emotionally] feeling very well.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And — and I think, like, it just made it worse that I was nursing.
THERAPIST: Well, you're tired.
CLIENT: But my mom is <i>so supportive</i>, but I couldn't really get a lot of calories into me, so I was like so hungry...
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: ...And it just was like — so I said to them when I went back for my checkup, I was like, "You know, if you have other patients who are breastfeeding, I would really advise them to [chuckles] probably wait if they can."
THERAPIST: Did they catch it — they probably weren't thinking about the...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Sort of added complications...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Because, yeah, I mean, it takes <i>so</i> many calories to breastfeed.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Plus, you're sleep-deprived, so you don't...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...You don't have that sort of resource at your disposal.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you can't just nap the whole day away.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: You know, if someone else is home without a kid and taking the day off from work...
CLIENT: Right, then it is no problem.
THERAPIST: ...They can veg and watch TV, and snooze on and off.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] I know, right.
THERAPIST: But you...
CLIENT: Yeah, so it was definitely a little different [clucks] than I anticipated.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I just — I'm so bad with blood, and especially like mouth, like [clucks]...
THERAPIST: Not bleed a lot...
CLIENT: ...That just, like — [cringes] <i>ughhh</i> — the whole thing just kind of grossed me out, so I really — it was not a good experience. But at least it is over, and now I feel a lot better. But even now, like, I still need to be eating soft foods and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, sensitive [inaudible at 02:31] sensitive.
CLIENT: Yeah. But at least it is over with, and — yeah, it is nice to just have it be done. But — I was trying because I knew, like — I was trying not to think too much about it. My sister was joking; she was like, "I didn't even know you were having this done. You never told me."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: She was like, "I felt bad. You never told me." And I just like didn't even want to talk about it before because I was worried about it, and — but it was funny 'cause it <i>was</i> kind of like a worry that I was anticipating it.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:02:59]
CLIENT: But it was nice that it was like one of those worries that I knew was kind of OK.
THERAPIST: Right. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So the more I worried about it, I was like, "You know what? But just be thankful that it is real worry and not up worrying about something crazy that you made up to worry about."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So, in a way, I feel like...
THERAPIST: Worried about the procedure?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That makes sense. It is an appropriate...
CLIENT: Yeah. And then, afterwards, I feel like it just like kind of took up so much energy just being uncomfortable and, like, worried about, again, like it healing properly.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But, again, all legitimate worries.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So it was kind of like I was thinking a lot about that 'cause I feel like I had another kind of good stretch of not really having these, like, worries that I — that are linking up.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I think that it was good to have [chuckles] these real worries.
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 03:44]?
CLIENT: [Chuckles] ...To kind of occupy my time. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: How — how intense would you say the worry was? So it was definitely an appropriate trigger because you think...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Having a medical procedure done is something that most people would be a little apprehensive about.
CLIENT: Right. [00:04:00]
THERAPIST: But how intense was it for you?
CLIENT: I feel like it wasn't too bad 'cause I had, um, [clucks] — years ago, even in high school, I was supposed to have my wisdom teeth out, and even in college, and I put that off for years and years and years, and it ended up, like, I had to have braces, and my teeth shifted, and I just turned it into this huge worry.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I finally did it, but it was like years after I should have, and ended up needing to get my teeth straightened again after I did it.
THERAPIST: Ohhh.
CLIENT: So I kept telling myself — like, I didn't want to turn it into that...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...And that's why it — like, when they told me I needed to have it done, I just scheduled it, like, [taps surface] then to just get it over with,
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I was trying not to...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right.
CLIENT: Because I feel like, with my wisdom teeth, I <i>did</i> let it overtake my — and I was, like, in college, and I guess after college when they did it, in grad school. But that was, like, a very intense worry that I think went overboard.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: Um, so I tried to be much better about it this time [chuckles] around. And because they had downplayed it so much...
THERAPIST: You [did set much time] (ph), right.
CLIENT: ...Yeah, I kind of thought, like, it is not that big of a deal. Like, they say people go back to work that day. [00:05:00]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I just — so I think — I think it was in check. I don't think it was like, um, too much of a worry. And even the night before, I was restless, sleeping, but like I — I was sleeping OK, and I do feel like it was — I handled it OK, I think.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I think if I had known in retrospect [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...What it would have been, I don't think I would [chuckles] have handled it so well.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, but I did feel like OK. And I had, like, one moment with Todd where, like, I cried about it beforehand and was a little nervous, but...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...But I think...
THERAPIST: But that's OK because everything went OK.
CLIENT: Yeah, it was OK.
THERAPIST: I mean, I think the gauge to use is, like, how much is it interfering with the other things you need to do in that day.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, if it was a time when you were in school, could you focus on your reading? If it is a time when you're home, can you do the other things you're supposed to be doing during the day?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Are you taking care of them? And it sounds like you were.
CLIENT: And I — yeah.
THERAPIST: And yet there were times when you thought about it and, you know, you needed some support.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But [pauses] that came alongside your other responsibilities. [00:06:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, right. And I think the timing actually worked out well because it happened a week and a half ago, so on a Wednesday, and that Tuesday beforehand I had [clucks] this final meeting with that teacher who I'd been working with all year...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...On our project, and we did this [baby coos] kind of final interview with her, where we were both kind of reflecting on our project together.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I was so focused on <i>that</i> that that was kind of nice...
THERAPIST: That you could kind of focus on that.
CLIENT: Yeah, right. And my sister actually met us at — we went to my teacher's house for the interview, and my sister met us to take Trae, and they just kind of played in the other room and...
THERAPIST: Mm, so you could focus?
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's why my sister was laughing. She was, like, "I saw you the day before. You didn't even say anything."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I do think part of me was like, you know, looking forward to that interview...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...And kind of focused on that and [shifts in seat] preparing for that. So it — it was kind of nice to have that distraction for [what I do] (ph).
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I think it did [sound of banging on an object] work out OK.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you made it through and...
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm just glad it is [chuckles] over. [00:07:02]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It helps you won't have another one, but if you do, I think it is important to recognize that part of what made it difficult was not just to procedure but the procedure in the particular circumstances that you were in.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because it sounds like it was made much more difficult by the fact that you couldn't eat, and you're breastfeeding, and...
CLIENT: Right. Yeah, I think all of that kind of complicated things a little.
THERAPIST: And [clucks] pain is more intense when you are sleep-deprived.
CLIENT: Really?
THERAPIST: Um, or the — one of — I mean, it just makes it — everything that you normally have to cope with is harder to cope with.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So pain is usually more intense, um, because you can't use sort of your resources to [sounds of banging] manage it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, [clucks] you know, feeling sort of irritable because you're hungry is worse when you're tired, too.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: So I think that...
CLIENT: It is like a perfect storm. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right, usually intensified by the fact that, you know, you're a mom of a four month-old?
CLIENT: Yeah, four and a half month old now. I know, it is crazy. Yeah. But I do — so that was kind of like, in a way — whenever I was kind of feeling down about it, I was like, "Well, you know, it is a real worry, and you're fine; like, you're not worrying about something that is making you frustrated with yourself. " [00:08:08]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I think that was kind of good.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah, once it was over and returned back to...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Then you were able to feel <i>good</i>.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. So it is — yeah, it was good to have that over, and I feel like...
THERAPIST: Well, I'm glad you made it through.
CLIENT: Yeah, me, too. [Chuckles] And it was nice to have my mom to help us, too, so...
THERAPIST: Yeah, you have really good support.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I feel like, now, the only other thing that is really on my mind is, as soon as it turned July 31, I got this pit in my stomach. Oops!
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 08:39]
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] You're playing, huh? Um, right, knowing that I was going to wake up, and it was August, and that was kind of like our...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Last month of like it just being the two of us at home together...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And just like kind of envisioning what life is going to be like when I'm back in school.
THERAPIST: [Clucks] Mm.
CLIENT: And just trying to also, with this deadline — [aside to baby] Hey — of finals being due for last semester on September first. [00:09:07]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It has been so hard to find time to get that done.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I — [becomes exasperated] like, at the beginning of this summer, I was trying to kind of — like thinking we'd nap, like, and I'd try and do a little bit of — like if he was playing, you know, or like...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: [Baby begins to fuss] ...You know, occupied, I was kind of like typing with one hand. And then I realized, "I really do not want to do that."
THERAPIST: Not work, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah, like, I wanted to — when I was holding him, I wanted — I want to be focused on my — all of my attention on him.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And then, like, if he's napping that's great, and I can get like an hour in or something if he takes a long nap.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it just like wasn't working to have that triangle (ph).
THERAPIST: Can't do both of those at once.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so then I was asking my mom [baby coos] — you know, we were trying to figure out — like, she was coming down, but it was 'cause I was very [baby coos] [inaudible 09:51] and nursing, too, [baby continues to fuss] it was just like two-hour stretches, really.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so I just — I was not really being that proactive in the beginning of the summer to get it done anyway, so... [00:10:02]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Now I'm like, [baby continues to fuss] "OK, I really need to get in gear here." And so I have three that are due and one, thankfully, is done, that I was working on with a partner. And, um, the big one with my collaborating teacher that we've been working on. I've been trying really hard to get a — just even like incomplete but just like a draft...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Of that done before we go out to Canada. Um, we're going to Canada on Wednesday.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So then I can move on to the third one when we're in Canada because I know my mom will be around to help.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it has just been like hard to try and get this middle one...
THERAPIST: Done?
CLIENT: ...Done. And I've been experimenting. Like, one day, my mom was home, so Trae and I drove out to my parents' house, and he was great [baby fusses a bit] [on and off] (ph), and I got a lot of work done. But then, on the way home, it was like a disaster, and he screamed...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...The <i>entire</i> way. And he's just — he does not like being in the car. If he is ready to fall asleep, usually, he'll fall asleep...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...But if he's not, like, he just <i>screams</i>. And so it was so hard when I was by myself with him... [00:11:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And so, then, like, my mom was coming down to us, but it is kind of a — um, it is still an hour, so to, like, keep asking her to come down is a lot to ask of her, I feel like. [Baby coos] And then, last week, we tried meeting halfway, and I just went into a public library, and she took him for a walk.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So we've been, like, totally...
THERAPIST: Right, [that's a trying thing] (ph).
CLIENT: ...Clean (ph). My sister is actually coming down this afternoon after work, [baby fusses] and she'll take him for two hours.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I feel like now I am being more proactive about asking for help.
[Baby continues to fuss]
THERAPIST: Well, can you do a longer stretch of work if you pump ahead of time and can — will he take a bottle?
CLIENT: Yeah, he will. So I think, yeah, that will work, too, but we just haven't, like...
THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems like [baby coos loudly] you need to almost do sort of like a kind of [pull that away] (ph), maybe but [sound of banging on object] [baby continues to coo] try a longer stretch so that you can really get in — get a lot done in one chance.
CLIENT: Yeah, right. Yeah, 'cause I feel like, now, we're lucky that we get to go up to Canada, and I think I will get work done up there 'cause my whole family will be there, and they'll want to be with him anyway... [00:12:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...So I can kind of sneak away. But then I keep thinking, then we get home, and we'll really just have a week or a week and a half before - the first week of school is more just like registration and stuff like that [baby continues to coo], but I will be in the mode of school.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so I feel like this tension like I don't want my last weeks home with him to be like that pressure of needing to finish the finals. Like, I want to be doing the things we like to do and having our fun time together and really enjoying that. [Baby continues to coo] So it has been — like I'm...
THERAPIST: You're conflicted.
CLIENT: Yeah, it has been hard, 'cause I feel like now like I'm realizing — and, all along, I've been realizing how lucky I've been to be able to be home with him. And I know when school starts again, like, I'm really going to look back on this time and miss it. [Baby coos]
THERAPIST: What is your school [baby continues to coo] plan?
CLIENT: It is going to be OK, actually. I think I'll be home with him on Fridays, which is nice. Like, I feel like I can look forward to kind of recreating the little days we've had this summer, on Fridays... [00:13:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...So I think that [taps surface] will be good. Um, and I think I'll end up taking the equivalent of, like, two and a half courses, which should be manageable [baby coos] 'cause I've taken four in the past, so that...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And I'm going to also be a teaching assistant for another course. Um, and I'm, like, trying to do, like, get some kind of research assistantship or something 'cause [baby begins to fuss] our program is fully funded, and I've been lucky enough to get a scholarship for the first two years, and then it [kicks in] (ph) on the fifth, but years three and four don't have the money. [Taps surface]
THERAPIST: [You'd have the money] (ph).
CLIENT: So I'll have to, like, pick something else up just to get a little bit more money.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But it won't be such an intense year in terms of coursework and professors' deadlines; it'll more be like finishing up my courses in the fall, and then I move onto my <i>own</i> research, where it is <i>me</i> setting deadlines for myself.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So I <i>do</i> think I'm moving into a time in school where it will be a lot more flexible than the past two years. [Baby begins to fuss]
THERAPIST: Is he going to a center, or do you have...? [00:14:01]
CLIENT: So then my mom is going to watch him two days a week, which will be awesome.
THERAPIST: Ahhh.
CLIENT: Um, and then Todd's mom is going to do one day a week up until they leave for Arizona in, like, the end of November, I guess. And then — so we're going to just need one day.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 14:16]
CLIENT: And I think we found — right — I think we found a, um, family daycare...
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: ...That will do one day a week. But even that - like, I've just been like...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...We've - we went and visited them and we, you know, called some references that they gave to us, and we found out about them through a friend of a friend, so we've been, you know, where...
THERAPIST: Right, it is still hard for you.
CLIENT: But it is still hard [becomes emotional] to, like, think about sending him there and — yeah, [fidgets with an object] I've even had, like, dreams he makes this little pout face where he'll stick out his bottom lip, and I have dreams of him doing that, like [chuckles] at the family daycare, just like thinking about — thinking about that.
THERAPIST: [Faintly] Mm.
CLIENT: But I think that, like — that's another thing where I felt like going to the moms' group and things like that — like, I know that's kind of another legitimate [sound of banging in the background] kind of thing to think about. And I don't feel like that's been like a... [00:15:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah, [it is a big deal] (ph) to have with someone else care for him, and you've been spending — you know, the majority of your time has been with him thus far.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So that is a big shift to the [sound of banging on an object] getting ready just to have that separation.
CLIENT: Right. And I'm glad that it will just be one day, and I do think that will be <i>good</i> for him, too, 'cause other than that he'll just be at home with either my mom or his — um, [clucks] his other grandmother.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So to be with other, um, kids — I think it will be good, [sound of banging on an object] and I think that will work out well. But it is just a lot to, like, anticipate all starting at the end of the month, I guess.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, right. Yep, it is a big shift coming up.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you want to savor the time that you have but...
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: ...There's some getting ready to do.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Baby coos] And it has been really helpful to be going to this new moms' group that I've been going to 'cause there is another mom there, who is going back. [Baby coos] She's a, um — [clucks] I think she does, like, internal medicine. [Baby coos] She's a doctor of a family — maybe family practice. Um, and she was kind of anticipating the same thing. She was saying how she's been really upset about going back, but she's also been thinking, like, it is nice to think this is kind of the start of our real life. [00:16:12]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know, that all of your life is not going to be me home every day with Trae. Like...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Eventually, I'll be back at school, and then I'll have a job.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I'm kind of like that...
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 16:20] being a stay-at-home parent.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: ....When you were — when you [fight this] (ph).
[Baby fusses]
CLIENT: Right. And so that was kind of a nice way to think about it.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I've been trying to remind myself of that. Like, we got this little playtime, but it would be kind of fun to see how our real life works...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...The three of us — and like how that will kind of work as a family and...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean this is really a maternity leave.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: And there's a really good purpose for that...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...But it doesn't necessarily need to be a maternity leave forever.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
[Baby continues to coo]
THERAPIST: I think it is also — it is another way of [sound of banging on an object] looking at it is that things wouldn't be change — even if you — even if you did decide to become a stay-at-home parent...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Things would change anyway... [00:17:01]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Because of your schedule with a three month-old is very different than what your life would look like at home with a six month-old.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, even just noticing how much he's changed from three months to four months...
[Baby fusses a bit]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Is so — I mean, he's so alert now, and he's not content to just be with you and nursing wherever.
CLIENT: Right, [chuckles] I know.
THERAPIST: Um, things with — you would have a lot of changes coming up, you know, a month from now anyway...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Even if you were staying home.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So there are different changes because you're going to be going back to your work.
CLIENT: Right.
[Baby continues to coo]
THERAPIST: But you wouldn't be able to keep this exact same sort of story anyway.
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, [pauses] yeah. But it has been — like I still do feel like it is reassuring that I know these are all, like, kind of common.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I don't feel like this is one of the things that I have that is my, like, kind of...
THERAPIST: Yeah, this is not [feeling anxious] (ph).
[Baby continues to coo/fuss]
CLIENT: Feeling anxious, yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: This is - these are things that most [baby coos loudly] — yes, there is always — you know, there is that continuum. There's people way on the other end of the scale that worry about nothing. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Mm, right. [Chuckles] [00:17:59]
THERAPIST: But most people that are somewhere in the middle — these are the — these are some of the big things that are appropriate concerns.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And, you know, checking in with yourself — you know, this is just a thing that other people are thinking about.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yes. How much — how much worry does — does it get for you...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...Is really — it sounds like being the question.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And it sounds like it is fairly appropriate.
CLIENT: Yeah. It <i>does</i> feel OK right now, and I do feel like — I'm trying to just like set little milestones in terms of the, um — the finals that I need to finish.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: 'Cause I feel like <i>that's</i> something that I will — like, right now, it is OK 'cause it is still early August.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I — if I don't kind of — in my mind [baby coos] I'm thinking, like I want a draft done before we go to Canada, and I want to get a lot done in Canada. And I feel like if that doesn't happen, then I'm going to [baby coos] start to feel more anxious about finishing it, just because I want to get it finished and because I don't want to feel...
THERAPIST: ...That this last week is too much] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, setting yourself up for success... [00:19:01]
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST: ...You know, might include [pauses] having some sort of, like, Plan A and Plan B. So for your time in Canada, um, your expectations like you are going to take him, and you're going to be able to spend some time away, figuring out how to make — what is — what are the things you can do to minimize the hurdles in that?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, so if he is having a fussy time, you know, having a good supply of breast milk...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ....That you can leave so that you don't feel like you need to run back.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, or setting up some quiet places where you can get away-away...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...You know, if you need to do that so that you can spend longer. You know, if you're having a time when you're getting a ton done...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And you could even stay away longer [chuckles] ...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Setting stuff up like that so you know, like, where can you go that he's — that you won't be worried that he's not, you know — if you're about to finish, and you're like behind on a bottle... [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...Um, that's going to be really hard for you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...But if you know that there's plenty of milk for him or that there's plenty of people to rely on... [00:20:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And you know being up if your mom gets tired...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...You know, that your sister's around or [I think, so]...
CLIENT: Right, [everyone will be there, I think — my grandmother, will be all be in line] (ph) [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: It means setting up things so that you have the most chance of being successful at...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Him getting great bonding time with your family, and you getting time away.
CLIENT: Right, mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...So that you can preserve your time later.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's a good way to put it. Like, I do feel like I want to preserve that time. And it is almost like I don't want to look back at the end of our — our time together and almost feel like that, "Ah, I wish I <i>was</i> able to spend more time with him."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know, like I don't want to have any regrets. I think it is like that feeling, of once I start back at school, I just want to know I made the most of my time with him. So...
THERAPIST: I think you really have.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Even if your — even if this last month does not mirror what you had the first couple of months...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...I've heard the way that you've talked about this time, and it sounds like you've done a really nice job of being appreciative for the time you've had... [00:21:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ....And being really present for the time. And your time with him is not over.
CLIENT: Right, I know. That's true. I need to remember that, though.
THERAPIST: I mean, you will be his mom forever.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: So your <i>maternity</i> leave time is coming to an end, but you do have lots and lots of time that you're going to have with him.
[Baby coos]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I know. That's a good way to think of it, too. [Chuckles] [Baby continues to coo] [pauses] And I think, too, just — I haven't really let myself anticipate too much, like, what it will be like with school just in terms of — but the only thing I've really thought about is that I want to be good about, like, setting boundaries and having Fridays. Like something already came up with a course that I'm a teaching fellow for, and sometimes we offer, um, [clucks] like, drop-in sessions or support sessions on Fridays.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so we were among the teaching fellows trying to figure out who would run that Friday, and, right away, I was like, "I can't do that."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And that just made me realize I — I want to be really good about, like, if someone wants to set up a meeting or something, like it would probably be easy 'cause I won't have any class... [00:22:04]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And it would be easy to just throw him in a stroller and come in the Square and have a meeting, but I don't want to do that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like I want to keep that day as a day for us.
THERAPIST: That's really not a workday for you.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But then I just — like, I am thinking about — like I wonder how it will kind of work out in terms of my workload for school and — and I feel like the course load is — it will be manageable, but I do feel like I'm trying to like pull in a couple of extra things just to make some money 'cause that scholarship money is gone this year.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So I just — I also want to make sure, like, I don't...
THERAPIST: How necessary is that?
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's something Todd and I have been talking about. It might not be, like, so necessary to, that I think we can maybe even just see how it goes.
THERAPIST: Mm, so that's something to kind of have a...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...You know, sit down, look at your finances together, have a discussion in what — you know, what really is figuring out what the limits are. [00:23:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...What's necessary, do you need to be worried about money, how much... [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...So that you know what — 'cause, I mean, there's, you know, what you get and what you give up for a [inaudible at 23:09]...
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: ...And figure out what's really — what does it mean for your family.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. [Pauses] And I think I just, like — already, I kind of have the sense that things will be very [chuckles] finalized (ph) for me.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I think, before Trae came, school — obviously, I had my family and Todd that were very important, but school was very important, and I let that kind of take over sometimes, and that was a source of a lot of the anxiety for me.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And I'm hoping now that, you know, that's not going to be the case anymore. And I find that already. Like, even with these finals, like, I...
THERAPIST: Well, and with the reaction you had to the Friday meeting.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Absolutely, from what I know of you. You were pre-Trae — you would have taken on that Friday.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. I know. [00:24:01]
THERAPIST: It might not — you know, it would have worked to reduce a workload on another day, and...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...But it made sense. Instinctively, now you're — you're [managing that time as precious] (ph).
CLIENT: Right, yeah. So I <i>do</i> just want to make sure, like — I think that the intensity that I had with school — there's a way I could keep that up now that I'm a mom, and I don't really want to, either.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But I hope that — I hope that I'm good at letting go of that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, like I — and I kind of think that I will be, but because I'm not back in the swing of it...
THERAPIST: Right, it is hard to limit (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What would your sign be to yourself?
[Baby makes a gastric noise]
CLIENT: Oh. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Excuse you. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: You (ph). [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: How would you know if it was getting too intense with school?
CLIENT: I think with — I think the feeling — like, those anxious feelings, I think, about school would start coming back. And I — and I wonder, like — right now, it is nice that I don't really feel like I'm up at night worrying about what I'm going to do with the finals. [00:25:01]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think if I come home from Canada and they're not — and not where I am, maybe it will.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I've even — like, a couple of nights, [sound of banging on an object] I have been — like, before, um — like when we were putting him to bed, wishing I got a little more done during the day, and I have stayed up, like a little bit after Todd's gone to bed. [Sound of banging on an object] and had a tight [inaudible at 25:22] I stayed up for an extra hour or two and didn't go to bed until pretty late. And I am tired today, but it was nice to get it done, and then I was OK.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so [pauses] it has been nice that it <i>hasn't</i> really turned into, like, an anxious worry yet, and I think that will be the sign once school starts up again.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like if — if I am kind of into my old habits of letting school keep me up and worry about that, or like those silly things that I would make up about, like, "Have I [chuckles] plagiarized on the assignment that I just turned in," or things like that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: I think those would be...
THERAPIST: Those would come back.
CLIENT: Yeah, those are the signs that...
THERAPIST: You've got to look out for that. [00:26:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, one thing that was really helpful to you in managing the anxiety was stuff like yoga.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Is there a way to make space for that in...?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...When that's going to be real life?
CLIENT: Yeah, and it is funny 'cause Todd and I were just talking about that, because is like another thing where I kind of feel this tension, where — 'cause we can get a really cheap gym membership through school, and I can sign up for that pretty soon. And I mentioned to Todd, "Part of me [slaps surface] feels like I shouldn't even get it because it might be a waste of money," and that's why — I would take the yoga classes, through that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: It might be a waste of money because I don't really see myself going to the gym because I feel like, when we have childcare, I'm just going to want to use those hours to get work done so that I don't have to do work otherwise.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so Todd was like, "Yeah, I can understand that, but you also don't want to give up doing things for yourself." And so I do — I wonder how that will play out 'cause I almost feel like, in my mind right now, if my mom is going to be — we haven't really figured out her hours yet, but they won't be like set nine to five... [00:27:02]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Because my schedule is funny, and we don't want her to have to deal with traffic.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, say, if she's there one day from ten to six, I'm going to want to use those hours to get work done so I don't have to <i>think</i> about work when I get home...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Instead of going to yoga.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But I don't know if that's going to be, like, the healthiest thing for me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, 'cause you want to be careful about having work only be — or you're dead — your life only be take care of Trae, take care of work.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But then there's no ...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...There's no couple time and there's no dinner time.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so I would — like, Todd and I were talking about that, and he — so we <i>got</i> it, but <i>he</i> was saying...
THERAPIST: But I think — it is a — that's — and I don't know if this has come up in moms' group — I think that that's one of those things that you just need to be vigilant about all the time...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...'Cause it is very easy to creep into that when you have these outside pressures coming in.
CLIENT: Right. [Slaps surface] And then I was thinking, too, like, and once that starts to get, um, really [pauses] — [faintly] [I'm doing a diaper] (ph) but I change him as we're talking — um, once it starts to get dark out early, this won't work. But at least at the beginning of the fall, I feel like I also will be able to, um — when I get home, maybe throw him in the stroller and go for a walk. [00:28:12]
THERAPIST: Yep.
CLIENT: So it is kind of like [sound of banging an object] my way of doing — keeping it so I'm spending time with him but I'm also...
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you're also getting some exercise, and that's really good for anxiety management.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you want me to hold him while you get your stuff (ph)?
CLIENT: Oh, sure, except be careful just in case [chuckles] he does. In case he goes through.
THERAPIST: No, [inaudible at 28:27]
CLIENT: Thank you. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mom (ph) must be more comfortable.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Pauses] So that, I feel, will — I just think I can do some experimenting and figure out how that will work.
THERAPIST: [Aside to baby] Yeah, she's right there.
CLIENT: [Aside to baby] Hi.
THERAPIST: I'll give you that to [inaudible at 28:45]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Pauses] OK, let's see the damage you've done. [Chuckles] I don't want it (ph) to go through. [inaudible at 28:58]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I remember those. [00:29:00]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] [Aside to baby] [whispers] OK.
[Silence for 50 seconds except for inaudible whispers as mom changes baby's diaper]
[Baby coos]
THERAPIST: There, is that better? You want to be comfortable.
[Baby coos]
CLIENT: She's [seen that] (ph), right? [00:30:00]
[Silence again for 17 seconds]
THERAPIST: Trae, you're so cooperative.
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: There.
[Silence for another 15 seconds, baby coos]
CLIENT: At least it might [inaudible at 30:36] You're close to it.
THERAPIST: Are the baths (ph) OK?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. [Chuckles] We have plenty of those. [Chuckles] [Baby coos] Right? Yes. Right up to your neck.
[Baby coos]
[00:31:00]
THERAPIST: But before they start eating, it is much easier to manage.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 31:05]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Real food just makes it a whole 'nother...
CLIENT: Yeah, our friends were just saying that. They have a two year-old. Right.
[Baby coos]
THERAPIST: A good argument for delaying a [second one] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll stick that there. Good.
[Silence as mother cares for baby]
THERAPIST: Do you roll over?
CLIENT: He has, yes.
THERAPIST: Yeah, he looks like he's so close there.
CLIENT: He hasn't gone from his back to his belly yet, but he's gone from his...
THERAPIST: I think, yeah, it is easier to push off with your hands.
CLIENT: Yeah. He did that like maybe two weekends ago, and so I grabbed my phone. And I didn't get the first roll but I got the...
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: ...Second roll on camera, so the grandparents were very excited about that. [Aside to baby] OK, are we back on track? [Chuckles] Are we? [Sound of zipping something] There. [Whispers] OK. [Sounds of putting things away] [00:32:05]
THERAPIST: I don't know if the company that transcribes this has experienced that...
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...Just a quick break for diaper change!
CLIENT: [Chuckles] I wonder if they could hear it, you know?
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: They'll get a good laugh about that [chuckles] when they're transcribing. [I don't know how you can type that] (ph)...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...A little poop noise, but that's OK. [Chuckles] So I <i>do</i> think that, like figuring out time for myself.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But I think what I learned like since even talking with you is knowing that that time to exercise — like, to do yoga or whatever it is — has been helping me to just kind of keep things in check.
THERAPIST: Yes, it does. Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it has been nice now. Like, it is funny, but I do feel like — I haven't been to the gym since I was pregnant, but I do feel like we're out so much, walking around and stuff... [00:33:01]
THERAPIST: Oh, but that counts.
CLIENT: ...Like I've been feeling really good. Like, I don't even feel like I'm that out of shape 'cause I feel [chuckles] like we're just playing like...
THERAPIST: You're being really active.
CLIENT: ...Like, five miles a day on the stroller, so...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah, and that absolutely — you don't have to be in the gym to be exercising.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST: And — what — while the weather is still nice, you know, you've got <i>all</i> of fall.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You can still probably utilize that as getting some movement into your day.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it releases a lot of tension for you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I do think that would be something fun to come out for, too, when I get home as long as the timing works for daylight and stuff. After being at school all day, that we can go for a long walk, and I'll get to see <i>him</i>, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: So that would kind of be doing two in one...
[Crosstalk] [Baby coos]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, [inaudible at 33:40] so you can really go on nice walks.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, soon, we can actually start jogging once he gets a little bit bigger, so that will be good, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But — but then I think I <i>will</i> need — I <i>do</i> need to figure out — like, there has to — it has to be OK, I think, for me to feel that it was OK to go and do yoga by myself or something.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:34:00]
CLIENT: But, right now, I feel like when I have those childcare hours, it is almost like this sense of, like, guilt, like I shouldn't be using that really for me.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I should be using them to get work done so that I'm not wasting time, you know, that I could be spending with him.
THERAPIST: Where do you think that message comes from?
CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really sure. And I — and this is all just kind of like anticipating it, too.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, but even now, we're...
THERAPIST: Well, even now, when he gets — 'cause you <i>do</i> have babysitting time.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You said your mom has come up, and your sister will take some time, and you're not using that to go to the gym or to meet up with a friend for coffee, or to read a book.
CLIENT: Yeah, right. Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: It sounds like you're using those times to work.
CLIENT: To work, yeah. And Todd brought that up, too.
THERAPIST: I think that's as efficient (ph) as possible. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah, that — I mean, we have — like, my mom has been great about taking him, and we have — even Todd's mom, last week, came and took him for a while. But, yeah, every time I have someone watching him, I have [baby begins to fuss] — I think we were joking, like, there was one night Todd and I went out, the two of us, and another night I went out and met a friend, but those are the only two times I really have done something fun when we've had someone watch him. [00:35:09]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so, right now, I think I'm so desperate to get the stuff done.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And it is really not — it is not like I'm not getting to it 'cause it is, um, like too hard or I don't feel like doing it. Like, I really — it is kind of fun to be working on this.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So, in a way, it is like not this, like, "Oh, I have to go do work."
THERAPIST: [But also hard] (ph)?
CLIENT: Like, it has been exciting to kind of dig into it and just work on these projects, so that's been nice. But that's been it. Yeah, like I haven't really had the time to just go and [pauses] go for, like, a...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I guess I did go for one little jog by myself when we were in Canada, but I haven't - like, you know, consistently, I haven't been able to use the time...
THERAPIST: ...For that.
CLIENT: ...That I get for myself, for — yeah, for just doing something fun. [Aside to baby] Right? [Baby coos] Are you getting squirmy? [Pauses] But I think all that we can just kind of figure out, too. [00:36:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah, that is something to keep an eye on, and that could be one thing...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Sort of that we make a point of just checking in on in here — how does your balance feel?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you have the balance that you need to be healthy? [Baby coos]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it might be that it can't be the same all the time. You know, you might figure out that certain times in the semester, maybe there isn't — maybe there really isn't time to do that stuff...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...But at other times in the semester, taking advantage of maybe a little bit more of a relaxed schedule.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: So that is a thing maybe for us just to be cognizant of.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that would be good.
THERAPIST: Because there is no perfect, you know, setup for everybody.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It is what — what do you need to feel healthy and to feel good about yourself...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And to give yourself as much permission to be flexible with that stuff as possible so you don't feel guilt-ridden.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, like, I don't — and I haven't felt those, like, guilty feelings, really, yet.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I <i>do</i> kind of anticipate feeling that once I go back to work, or not — to school.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And so I just don't want...
THERAPIST: Well, that <i>is</i> your work. [00:37:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah. And that's how, like, I have tried to approach it, too, 'cause I think that really helps instead of just always having work hanging over me. Like, I used to try and be good about going to school and...
THERAPIST: That this is your work?
CLIENT: ...This is a workday, and that not...
THERAPIST: Yeah, that worked really well for you last year...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Setting it up [taps surface] and having — having stop times and start times.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...And treating it the way you would a job.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: 'Cause it is your job.
CLIENT: Right, and not really having to come back to it once I was home, after dinner, like having...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And so I think doing that again will be really helpful.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and extending that to be [pauses] to — you know, to, like, your Fridays or your weekend time.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And that — I was thinking about that, too, 'cause I feel like, now, we like cherish the weekends, too, because it is so nice when Todd is home and not working, that that's our time to be a family, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: The three of us. And usually laugh — like, I got much better last year about time on the weekends.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I think, the first year, I was in the library both days, every weekend for the most part, and I think, last year, I definitely toned that down and made sure I had one day of [sound of something banging] something fun... [00:38:09]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And then <i>did</i> go to the library, usually on the second day. And I was thinking about how will <i>that</i> play out now with Trae, too...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Because I feel like there will be that tension again, like, if there are leftover stuff that I need to do or have gotten done for work...
THERAPIST: Hmm, [pauses] right.
CLIENT: ...I could get it done on the weekends 'cause Todd would be home to watch Trae.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But...
THERAPIST: Does <i>he</i> work on the weekends?
CLIENT: He sometimes has to, too. Yeah, yeah. And he hasn't really needed to, um, since Trae's been — been born.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And he's been trying to really prioritize his time, too, and so, you know, he'll need to do, like, an hour here or there sometimes over the weekend.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, yeah, but that's something you're taking — to sort of manage who [baby begins to fuss, coughs] has — who has what work to do, who has Trae, and where is there time for you guys to do stuff [it sounds like] (ph)...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...So that you're not just passing back and forth.
CLIENT: Right, back and forth - exactly — when there is finding time for the three of us all to be together. So I do — I think it'll just like — there's a lot to kind of anticipate, and I <i>do</i> feel like it has been OK. Like, I don't feel like all of these unknowns that I'm thinking about have, like, led to all these anxious feelings. [00:39:12]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I do know that there are — just they are...
THERAPIST: That they're just kind done, and you don't have to figure out how they're going to work out.
CLIENT: Figure out — yeah, yeah — which, right now, feels OK. [Chuckles] So, hopefully....
THERAPIST: Yes, so it seems like they're really in check.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That these are not things that are — they're not obsessions.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And that's a very different thing. You know, what you were struggling with when you first came in was that these worries had become, you know, obsessions.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: They just took up <i>so</i> much space and so much intensity.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it seems — you know, these things float in, you kind of hash them over in your head, and then, in a sense, you've been able to push this out and say, "Well, we'll just see how that works out when September really comes."
CLIENT: Yeah. And that I already feel like has been so ni — like, when we — I feel like every time, like we talk about, I don't want that — like, those obsession kind of worries to come back. [00:40:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Clucks]
CLIENT: And — and that, like, is still on my mind, too.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think that is what — like, a little bit like will going back to school kind of like jumpstart that.
THERAPIST: Right, and that's why you stay — you know, and that's why you haven't terminated therapy.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because, if you look back at how you've done, I'd say most of the times that you've come in here in the past six months, it is, "Things went really well. There was this one hard day, but, overall, I'm doing really well."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you've been doing really well for a long time.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: And I think, you know, the reason that you're continuing your sessions now is it is maintenance.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And 'til you get to a place where you feel comfortable, that what has been happening for you the past six months is what is going to continue to happen...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...When you're comfortable in that, that's when you may need to stop.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Um, but for now, I think our work really is checking in, reminding you of all the skills you have to manage this stuff...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...And helping you feel comfortable with that. If we notice signs of this stuff coming up, it is not going to take over the way it did before... [00:41:00]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Because you know how to respond to it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And, you know, you have place to check in what level is this at...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST: ...And that's — you know, that's what we use this stuff for again.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What level are these worries at? Are they appropriate, or is it becoming something that's — that we need to like kind of step up a little bit to push them into the right spot.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And it <i>does</i> feel nice now to have had, like, time where...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...There haven't been those like kind of obsessive worries. But I was thinking the other day, too, it is funny they — [clucks] I don't feel like this huge amount of time where I've been away from it. I feel like it is still very close.
THERAPIST: I think it still feels brand new to you.
CLIENT: Yeah. And so I think that's — like, even yesterday, there was, um — I ran into an old friend who just had a baby and is nursing, and we were talking about how hard, like, breastfeeding can be and...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Then she was having trouble pumping, and she was like, "Well, how much do you usually get when you pump?" And I just said right away, like, how many ounces I usually got.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And then she was like, "Yeah, I'm only getting like around one." [00:42:00]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: And as soon as I said — like, I was like, "Oh, I wonder if I hurt her feelings." Like, I was a little worried that I shouldn't have [chuckles] given a number or ounces, 'cause did that, like, add more pressure to her? And when we finished talking, she was like, "You've made me feel so much better." Like...
THERAPIST: Aww...
CLIENT: And so, afterwards, like, even last night, it was kind of like I came back to that, and I was like, "I really hope I didn't hurt her feelings. Like, I should never have said the number of ounces I can get when I [chuckles] pump."
THERAPIST: Mm. But that's — that's what you're <i>experience</i> is.
CLIENT: Right. But then, like — and so I kind of like feel myself. Like, I was a little antsy and I was coming back to that...
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST: Like [you were trying to blame] (ph)?
CLIENT: ...And then [baby fusses] — but I did think to myself, but then she said to me, "You have made me feel so much better," so think about that.
THERAPIST: Maybe you just should take her at her word.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it is OK.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And even if she <i>did</i> feel badly — you know, if she was jealous of the amount that you got versus the amount that she's getting...
CLIENT: Yeah...
THERAPIST: ...But that's your <i>experience</i>.
CLIENT: Yeah, right.
THERAPIST: And you certainly didn't say it with any malice.
CLIENT: Right. [Sound of something banging] [00:43:00]
THERAPIST: And, you know, part — you can't be responsible for what her feelings are.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: If she feels, you know, frustrated or — or whatever might come up for her, that's <i>her</i> stuff to deal with.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, you certainly can't control the amount of milk she produces.
CLIENT: Right [chuckles], yeah.
THERAPIST: Um...
CLIENT: If I could, I would have to go into business.
THERAPIST: And you're not really controlling the amount of milk that <i>you're</i> producing.
CLIENT: No, I don't.
THERAPIST: It is just that your body is producing, and so be it.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. But I kind of thought of that as an example of something that maybe could have made me...
THERAPIST: That could have, right.
CLIENT: ...Or even more...
THERAPIST: ...Or you could have dwelled on.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, because I think — that it sort of hit one of your key fears. You don't — you don't like it. You have a hard time when people are either upset with you or you feel like you've done something to upset someone.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's a really touchy spot for you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And while you certainly don't have any control over her milk or your milk, it just it what it is.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Um, you were worried that you had made something uncomfortable for her.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: But recognizing that, one, she expressed something to you, and you need to take her at her word... [00:44:03]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...And, two, you don't have control over that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know? And that can't be something that is in your control, what her feelings are.
CLIENT: Right, [pauses] yeah. So I think that was — like, it did feel OK that I wasn't, like that didn't escalate into...
THERAPIST: Right, you were able to notice that that was a touchy spot. You...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you saw what you were doing. You saw where you went back to it...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...And you worked it out for yourself.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.
THERAPIST: And it seems like — and you worked it out for yourself rather than checking in with someone about whether you had done the right thing.
CLIENT: Yeah. Although, I might have checked in. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Oh, you did? Are you sure? [Chuckles] OK, we'll give you credit for it, then.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] I forget who I was talking to. I might have said to my mom or someone, to our other friend who was there.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: So I might have — but yeah...
THERAPIST: Got to work on it. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I think I did, yeah. I think I did. I'll confess that I think I did check in [chuckles] with someone else, but, um — but that — yeah, that didn't feel like something that, like, escalated into a big thing.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:44:58]
THERAPIST: Well, let's — why don't we plan to meet, I think, one more time in August, maybe, before you start?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's sounds...
THERAPIST: ...Or we can do more than that because it is [taps surface] covered now.
CLIENT: Right, I know.
THERAPIST: So if you want to — I guess it is really what feels best for you in preparing for this sort of last month of leave.
CLIENT: I know. I should look at my phone to see. Um, we're not — so we're going up to Canada on Wednesday, and then — [becomes emotional] oh, good, thank you. Um, just trying — we're not exactly sure when we're coming home.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: 'Cause this is a vacation [baby fusses] that we go on with, like, a whole bunch of other families and...
THERAPIST: Sounds nice.
CLIENT: ...And I'm not sure how long it will last, like smashed in. [Baby fusses] I don't even know if we're going to have a bedroom, like what the situation [chuckles] is going to be.
THERAPIST: Oh. [Chuckles] [So picky] (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, we know up until Saturday we have — we have our own bedroom, and then we're going to take it from there. So I'm not sure about next week.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: But then, after that, I think we're, um — we're around. So the week of the...
THERAPIST: So maybe the week of the twentieth?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that would probably be good because that next week is when, um, school starts. [00:46:01]
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: It is just like orientation kinds of stuff.
THERAPIST: OK.
CLIENT: But I think that would probably be good to check in that week.
THERAPIST: So I could either do — I have time, um — I could do the same time on Monday at 11:30 [baby fusses], or it looks like Tuesday afternoon I have, um, a 2:30 or a three.
CLIENT: Let's see. How about — I think Monday at this time should work.
THERAPIST: OK, so Monday at 11:30? [Writes down information]
[Silence for 14 seconds]
CLIENT: [Whispers] Great.
THERAPIST: OK. [Pauses] And then we'll go [sound of objects sliding] [plan on maybe picking a surprise] (ph)...
