I think with all of us, and certainly with me, there
was a constant fear that the doctors would give up on us and send
us to River's Edge.


The receiving hospital treated only short-term cases, cases the
doctors felt might be cured within a few months. So after a
patient had been in the hospital, say two months, he'd begin to
wonder just what would happen if the doctors thought he wasn't
making improvement fast enough. And, of course, what he
thought would possibly happen was commitment to River's Edge.


Actually, this fear was rather groundless. There were no
arbitrary limits on how long a patient could stay in the new
hospital. A patient could stay there just as long as the doctors
felt his hope of early recovery justified his stay—whether it
was one month or six.


And to be honest, I don't remember any patients being taken
to the old state hospital who were not in obvious need of a different
type of confinement from that afforded at the new one.
But still this fear was present, and with me, it was increased,
abetted by certain incidents.


For example, once I remember I told Dr. Andrews that I was
afraid of River's Edge, afraid I would end up there. And his
answer, though certainly it was given to allay my fear, only
served to intensify it.


"Why, Mr. Dahl, do you feel you may end up at River's
Edge?"

It was during a session with him, and as always, his pencil
was poised over his long, yellow pad, ready for a recording of
my answer.


"Well," I said, "when I see some of the others going, I think
maybe I'll be sent there too some day."


"Don't you feel that you are getting better here?"


Out of my fear I lied: "Yes."


"Well then, why should you be concerned about River's
Edge? Nobody here has indicated that you should be, or
might be, sent there, has he?"


"No."


A long stare, solemn-faced from Dr. Andrews to me, "<i>Do
you feel you should be there?</i>"


"No. But even though I feel I'm better, that doesn't mean I
am, or that you feel I am."


"What I feel—it's really not your prime concern, now is it?
The important thing is how you feel."


"I guess that's right, Doctor."


"Why don't you try looking at me as you talk, Mr. Dahl?
You're not afraid of me, are you?"


"No," I lied again.


"That's better. There's really not much down there on the
floor that should command your interest, is there?"


"No. It's just that I have trouble looking directly at anybody."


"I understand, Mr. Dahl. Now don't be concerned about
River's Edge. We were talking before, I believe, about your
relationship with your mother. You say she loved you?"


"Yes, of course she did. Doctor," I said, "<i>Do you think I'd
better sell my car?</i>"


"What?"


"Well, it's just sitting in a parking lot outside and Marilyn
doesn't drive and—I may be sick a long time."


"I don't believe you should worry about selling your car,"

He tucked his yellow pad carefully into his desk.


"I guess—" a look at his watch,—"that this concludes our
talk for now. Now, about River's Edge—we have no reason to
think your condition would be improved by your going there.
As long as you co-operate with us here, we think we can help
you."


"Yes, Doctor, thank you. Say, is River's Edge ... is it a lot
worse than here?"


Dr. Andrews smiled, wryly. "It's not as modern..."


Somehow, there was a reserve, a coldness about Dr. Andrews,
so that the very things he said to me to relieve my fears only
served to increase them. I left that interview more convinced
than ever that there was a real possibility that some day, for
"my own good," he might suggest commitment for me at River's
Edge ... particularly, I chose to sense, if he should decide
that I was not really trying to "co-operate" with him in his
efforts toward getting me well.


From then on, I tried with more vigor to please him in all
ways possible, by looking at him full-face as we talked, by attending
<i>all</i> the various functions of the ward, the recreational
and occupational therapies aimed at bettering our health, and
by following without overt, verbal combat the lead he furnished
me in our interviews toward finding the hidden source of my
troubles.


Diligently, anxious to show Dr. Andrews that I was trying to
get well, I brought up from my memory little facets of my early
life. But though Dr. Andrews seemed to be hinting to me,
through the stress he would put on this question or that, I could
see slight relationship between my faraway past and my present
condition.


"When you were little, were you much concerned about your
... popularity?"

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And I said, "No ... well, everybody wants to be liked, don't
they?"


"Yes," he said, "but some people are more concerned about
this than others."


"But you want people to think well of you."


"Of course, you do. But when you were growing up, do you
remember, were you very anxious that people like you?"


"No, I don't remember being that way. Why do you ask
me that?"


"Well, in here," he said, "aren't you anxious that we think
well of you?"


"That's natural, isn't it?"


"It depends," he said, "on just how anxious you are. Did
you try—desperately hard—to please your parents when you
were little?"


"Sometimes I did. But don't all children?"


"Some more than others. Did you try harder than most children,
do you think, to please your parents?"


"I don't know. How can I know? Perhaps I did, but how can
I know?"


"You may know, I think," Dr. Andrews said.


And in a later interview, the questions went on and on....


"How did you think of girls when you were growing up?
What did you think about them?"


"I don't know. About the girls I knew, I felt very strongly
about some of them."


"You felt you loved some of them?"


"Yes."


"How did you feel about your love for them?"


"I was idealistic about them. When I was sixteen, the girls
who seemed beautiful, the ones I knew, they seemed very pure,
too, and I didn't want to soil that purity."


"You didn't want to soil that purity?" he repeated in a voice
filled with significance. "What do you mean by that?"


"Well, I didn't believe I should kiss them just for the thrill of

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048381-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The way you feel? Now, you mean?"


"Dr. Andrews," I said, "don't you think sex is an appetite
that can be completely divorced from any ideals of love a man
might have?"


"Some men think so," he said, his voice giving only the barest
hint that he did not necessarily agree....


"Did you drink much in the army?" Dr. Andrews asked.


"We all did. Just about everybody I knew, I guess. I guess
though that I tried to see how much I could drink, more so than
some of them, when I did drink."


"Did your drinking bother you?"


"No. I felt more free when I drank. And I wouldn't feel too
bad the next day, either. I'd feel relieved, sort of. And I
wouldn't drink any during the next day. When I was on duty,
I mean. I never got to that...."


And so he queried me and so I answered day after day. But
I could not make any sure connection, during this time, between
these things of my past life and my present. I could see that
certain things I'd done, certain things that had happened to me,
<i>could</i> have been either sources or signs of deep trouble, but I
didn't <i>believe</i> this to be true then—although later I did.


As we talked, on an intellectual level I could see possible
contributory causes and effects of causes in my past on my present
illness. But at that time I was not <i>sure</i> that these were real
reasons for my condition. And with this lack of sureness, I also
wondered how it could help me even if I came to know for certain
what the causes were. I wondered if it would be like being
struck by lightning; if all of a sudden I would be struck by a
white flash of insight and in this light I would be made whole.
I'd read stories in which this sort of thing happened to others,
yet I had no hope this might happen to me in my talks with
Dr. Andrews.

But nevertheless, because <i>he</i> seemed to think the talks might
help me and because I was frightened that if I didn't co-operate
with him he might declare my case one more suited for River's
Edge than for this hospital, I made a show of enthusiasm for
the talks.


These talks with Dr. Andrews—they formed only a small part
of my life in the hospital. Another part of my life was my
continuing relationship with the various patients. There was
Mr. Elder, for example....
