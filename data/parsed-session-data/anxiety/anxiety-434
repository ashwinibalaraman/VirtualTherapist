<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>7 o&apos;clock</i>. At last the poem ends and it ends literally in nothing at all.
Why did I change so rapidly through various stages of evolution in
the womb, backwards so to speak, just when I thought I was growing
up? I can&apos;t make it out. I can&apos;t believe that it really means a full-stop.
Shall just have to "wait and see. At the moment there is no reaction
but amusement and surprise. I think the amiable sea-serpent is my twin
brother, possibly also my father, the dark figure in the prow of the ship
possibly represents future developments, is also the Christ-figure of
‘The Door is Opened’.


<i>Later</i>. Presumably the sea-serpent is a phallic symbol. But why
stamp-collecting? The retrogression in the womb is also retrogression
in the evolutionary history of life. But where do we go from there?
Have I got to go back any further? I hope not.


<i>Later</i>. Having put down a few images, I have a horrid feeling that I
have to start again and reverse the process, i.e. Creation. ‘God created
the firmament, the sea and the dry land’, etc. O dear! so it proves. So
far I have reached the primitive plants! But this is fantastic. How
long is it going to take to get back to the Garden of Eden (for example)
and what is it going to mean to me as an individual when and if I do.
Has my mind taken a wrong turning and if so when? how? why? I
still feel that there is something important to come and that things
went wrong after that adolescent love affair. But they never went
wrong before. All very odd and depressing. I shall try a fresh start.


<i>Saturday, June 30th</i>. Intimations during the night.


(1) ‘Have patience, follow. You are led by a wisdom greater than
your own. You have gone a long way and you have a long way to go.
Look for the Double Identities, the Dual Personalities.’


(2) To A--. If you will trust me I can help you.


(3) To W--(the headmaster). Why are you my enemy, O my

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I really must try to establish a new relationship with W--, we are
at cross purposes all the time.


<i>Sunday, July 1st</i>. This morning I feel more competent and energetic
and detached than I have for some time. No doubt it is a temporary
change, but is in contrast with what I felt last night.


As a rule I dislike the vigorous, efficient, bustling type very much,
and God forbid that I should become one, but the School certainly
needs someone like that at the moment, everyone is lackadaisical
and bored, I suppose from want of leadership at the top. It is not
a role I covet, but I feel this morning, that I <i>could</i> do it, if necessary.
I do not think that anything that shows itself in the poems need be
lost. I begin to care less what people think about me, to act less, having
less to conceal. The only person who irritates me and keeps me at
arm&apos;s length is W--. I think he is afraid of me (or for me). Why?


<i>Further reflections on the poem:</i>


The phallic significance of the sea-serpent, the Great Barbel, becomes
embarrassingly clear (‘more miles than you can count’). Shades of
Malinowsky! I think the rubbery tendril, flower-shaped, is a contraceptive.
Hence stamp-collecting.


The milieu of nearly all these poems so far has been the womb in
various forms and disguises, forest, cave, room, city, lake, sea, cell,
garden, etc. The Creation of the world which I have started writing,
will also be a process of development of the foetus, followed by birth,
I expect.


Could the sudden return to the womb be an unconscious, symbolic
expression of regressive infantilism?


I write the poems ‘Creation’ and ‘Awakening or Pre-Birth’.


<i>Creation or Foetal Development</i>


A formless void,<br />
Stillness and darkness,<br />
A profound silence<br />
And an eternal night,<br />
Negation, absence,<br />
Indescribable.

<i>Pre-Birth or The Awakening</i>


Enclosed in a pearly globe,<br />
A tiny homunculus<br />
Wakes from his long sleep,<br />
Stretches and yawns<br />
And rubs his eyes.<br />
Feeling adventurous<br />
He cleans his little window<br />
And peers through the panes.<br />
Outside it is dark,<br />
But he thinks he can see<br />
A cave with a curving roof,<br />
Like a vast oyster shell,<br />
Nacreous, blue-grey,<br />
Shot with the colours<br />
Of emeralds and moonstones,<br />
Moist and gleaming,<br />
Contracting, expanding.<br />
He listens wonderingly,<br />
Holding a spiral shell<br />
Close against his ear,<br />
And hears with excited awe,<br />
A sound like the breaking waves

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>10 o&apos;clock</i>. Well, that&apos;s that. All done more quickly than I anticipated.
At least I have some sort of identity again. I suppose the next thing is
the birth struggle. I am rather afraid of this.


<i>Birth, The Mother</i>


Under an angry moon<br />
And a louring sky,<br />
A savage, howling wind<br />
Strips the trees of branches<br />
And hurls them madly<br />
Into the wounded earth.<br />
Pierced and panting,<br />
She heaves and shudders,<br />
Groans and screams<br />
In vast convulsions,<br />
Shaking, shuddering,<br />
Torn by enormous pangs.<br />
A terrible dark rain<br />
Rushes from the leaden sky,<br />
The moon is extinguished.<br />
Stars, shaken from their spheres,

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Birth, The Child</i>


The frail homunculus<br />
In his narrow submarine,<br />
Tossed by the terrible storm,<br />
Cowers and trembles,<br />
Covers his tiny ears<br />
With his weak hands,

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two more poems present the birth from the point of view of the
mother and the child. This time it is accomplished in its peculiar way.
It wasn&apos;t as bad as I expected. I suppose because of the anaesthetic.
Again I fell asleep afterwards. Queer, how archaic the first poem is,
and how animistic. Our Mother, the earth. Queer, too, that the forceps,
in the second poem, should be represented by ‘a questing, grappling
iron’. Perhaps the poems also represent a symbolic birth by earth and
water. But I think the ‘fleecy mattress’ and the ‘candle’ may be actual
memories.


<i>Note:</i> I was convinced at the time that the second poem was an
actual account, however oddly distorted, of my own experience
of birth.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>Monday, July 2nd</i>. At the moment I feel a marked sense of well-being
and an inward serenity, a feeling of being able to cope with people and
things, without the underlying strain and anxiety which I have felt
before. How long it will last I don&apos;t know. I write another poem which
seems to have strangely little to do with my present preoccupations. I
am sometimes frightened at being thus driven by something over which
I have no control.


Across the sky in power and splendour<br />
Heralded by winds and tempests,<br />
Hurtles the chariot of the sun.<br />
The mighty horses of Apollo,<br />
With their thundering, flying fetlocks<br />
Spurn the clouds in flakes of spume.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Note:</i> I did not transcribe the rest of this poem, because it
seemed conventional and bad.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


As usual after writing a poem, I feel less confident. I had some difficulty
with this one, and it does not seem real. My thoughts go back to A--.
I wonder if this means something more about the ‘Double Identities’.
It does. I write ‘The Garden of Eden’.


<i>The Garden of Eden</i>


On a fine afternoon I say to my little brother,<br />
‘Come let us go and pay a visit,<br />
You and I, brothers, older and younger,<br />
Each of us grown now wise and gentle,<br />
Each of us able to smile and make jokes,<br />
What shall we find there when we reach the place?<br />
Shall I tell you or you tell me?<br />
You tell me, my silent brother,<br />
You be the first to tell, knowing I love you,<br />
Knowing I am anxious to give you pleasure,<br />
To make it up somehow for our sad childhood.<br />
Though we both suffered, you were the weaker,<br />
And I, who carried you, sometimes unkind.<br />
It would make me happy if you could discover

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Note:</i> At the time I was thoroughly taken in by this poem.

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Diary continued:</i>


There are several things to be said about this. It was written fast
and with little effort. The conscious mind had no idea, even from
line to line, what would happen next.


‘Shy little brother’ who has to be coaxed at the beginning, ends up
as the dominant partner.


We are both growing up and are good friends, but not yet united as
one. The crown and the harp (Blake?) victory and music, triumph and
rejoicing? A kingdom (of heaven?). Art, Music, Poetry, Feminine
intuition, intimations of the Unconscious generally? The Aeolian
harp is usually the symbol of the highly subjective poet (Shelley).
The wind of the spirit blows and speaks through him. And very nice
too. I shall take the old snake&apos;s advice.


<i>Later</i>. I begin to feel troubled again and uncertain. Something very
wrong with A--. It worries me a great deal. He is so desperate. I
think my talk with him precipitated a crisis which I suppose would
have occurred anyway. I can only wonder about this. As indeed I
wonder at the whole thing, at the successive rebukes and humiliations
I receive, which I must accept as always just. I can hardly be blamed
for thinking that ‘the Garden of Eden’ was a step forward, never
dreaming that my little brother could be wrong and that I should
receive another punishment, another death, another birth. See ‘The
Fall’, ‘The Grave’, ‘The Resurrection’.


<i>The Fall</i>


I stand here desolate,<br />
Cast out of Paradise,<br />
Severed from my brother,<br />
His hand torn from mine,<br />
Guilty, despairing;<br />
While with his flaming sword<br />
Stands the righteous angel,<br />
Cold, implacable,<br />
Denying reunion,<br />
Decreeing without mercy<br />
That we shall meet here no more.<br />
Between us rages<br />
A sundering ocean,<br />
A vast abyss,<br />
A burning lake of fire,<br />
A gulf inconceivable--<br />
Whole worlds between us,

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>The Grave</i>


I wander, abandoned,<br />
In a wide wilderness.<br />
Too well I know it,<br />
The barren desert<br />
Heaped with ancient bones,<br />
The scorching wind,<br />
The thirst, the agony,<br />
The sharp, splintered rock.<br />
A pit of horror<br />
Gapes at my feet,<br />
Draws me helpless<br />
Towards its dreadful brink.<br />
Then a dark whirlwind<br />
Plucks me upwards.<br />
Torn from every hold,<br />
Battered and broken,<br />
My loathsome body<br />
Scarred, defiled,<br />
Shuddering, weeping,<br />
Ruthlessly tormented,<br />
Groping in darkness.<br />
I writhe and tremble,<br />
Lost, exiled, outcast,<br />
Cursed for a black sin,<br />
Because I would possess again<br />
The soul I so injured--<br />
Cast out from Paradise,<br />
For curs and prowling wolves<br />
To tear and devour me.<br />
No one to pity.<br />
Worthless, marred with guilt,<br />
The bright dream vanished--<br />
I, myself, the wolf&apos;s head,<br />
I the gluttonous vampire<br />
Preying on the child I loved.<br />
‘God, I cry to thee,<br />
Appear in glory,<br />
Stern, unrelenting,<br />
Scourge me, break me,<br />
Grind me to pieces,

<i>Resurrection</i>


Thus I lie in darkness<br />
A forgotten heap of bones<br />
Sealed in a tomb forever,<br />
All my sinful flesh<br />
Rotted away from me.<br />
Over my grave the keen stars<br />
Wheel across the dark sky,<br />
And a sharp, searching wind<br />
Scatters in whorls the blown sand.<br />
Then a white radiance<br />
Pierces like a sword<br />
And puts to flight darkness,<br />
Lays bare the barren tomb,<br />
Opens its rocky jaws,<br />
Fills every chink and cranny<br />
With its bright, blinding rays,<br />
Slowly the dry skeleton<br />
Stirs, and bone to bone<br />
Joins and knits itself,<br />
Upon the bones sinews,<br />
Nerves and muscles<br />
Grow and accumulate,<br />
And at length a garment<br />
Of clean, firm, living flesh<br />
Clothes them from head to foot.<br />
A faint glow flushes<br />
Warm through trunk and limbs,<br />
A tiny pulse throbs<br />
In wrist and forehead,<br />
The breast heaves gently<br />
In slow respiration,<br />
The nostrils expanded,<br />
The lips gently parted,<br />
Like a sleeping child<br />
Lies the resurrected body,<br />
Waiting for a word from heaven<br />
To rise and walk with open eyes.<br />
The cleansing desert wind<br />
Is hushed, the stars shine gently,<br />
The Dark Angel of Death<br />
Unfurls his raven plumes<br />
And takes his silent flight,<br />
Obedient to his master.<br />
Then a white bird,

<i>Diary continued:</i>


It is easy to be wise <i>after</i> these events, but will I ever learn submission
and humility? Well, the drama will play itself out. There
seems no place in it for my conscious mind, my will, my desires
or my intelligence. Yet it always seems so logical after it has happened
--Death and re-Birth in the womb, the sea (feminine). Death and
re-Birth in the dry grave, the desert (masculine). The extraordinary
thing is the close parallel with the Biblical story. The Serpent beguiled
me, and yet he seemed so right. I suppose the Garden of Eden is the
world of childhood and dreams. These poems were written with
extraordinary rapidity, because I was so desperate and there was
nothing else I could do.


But how complicated and mysterious it all is, I <i>never</i> seem to learn.
I am so muddled up that I can&apos;t think straight. I hope it will be clearer
tomorrow. Tonight I am empty and forlorn, and it seems to me that
I have lost all I had gained.


<i>Wednesday, July 4th</i>. After yesterday&apos;s terrible experience I begin at
last to see at least a specific problem a little more clearly. Whatever
else these poems are concerned with, and they refer to some very
obscure things, the one obvious fact is that they do refer to A--and
no amount of symbolic interpretation can dodge that fact. No doubt
Dr H--will smile to himself and everyone else will think it is a lot
of fuss about nothing, but it is <i>I</i> that have to pay the piper and dance
to his damnable tune, and who write this in tears at this moment. If I
re-read the ‘Garden of Eden’ it presents a perfectly clear picture. The
‘little brother’ (whoever else he may be) is A--and the poem tells
the story in quite an unequivocal way. It was I that indulged and spoilt
him. It was I that went with him back into the world of childhood and
encouraged him to escape from reality. And yet what else could we
have done or could I have done in the circumstances? I do not really
understand with my conscious mind why I have been selected for these
experiences. I tried to save A--. I did the best I could, and surely the
‘sins’ of which I am accused or accuse myself in the poems, are excessive,
the sense of guilt and bereavement excessive. I have never
thought of myself consciously as a sinner at all until now. I have got
to save that child whatever anyone may think or say.


<i>Note:</i> I still cannot really answer the questions posed here.
I do not think now that anyone could have ‘saved’ A--as I put

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Diary continued:</i>


Two more poems, ‘Green Pastures’, and ‘My Brother’. So lovely. I
don&apos;t think I will make any more comment. I will just try to believe
what I have been told and wait.


<i>Green Pastures</i>


By the still waters,<br />
Here, on a green hill,<br />
A shepherd pipes<br />
And tends his flocks.<br />
Over his head<br />
Shines the white moon.<br />
Crouched in shadow<br />
The sheep lie folded.<br />
They know the shepherd<br />
Will not forsake them,<br />
Will keep them from hunger<br />
And slake their thirst,<br />
Guard them from beasts of prey,<br />
Deliver their children,<br />
Heal their diseases,<br />
Hush their crying,<br />
Prevent them wandering,<br />
Seek them when lost<br />
Grazing on the mountain,<br />
Pluck them from danger<br />
With his ivory crook,<br />
Also tell them stories,<br />
Childish but wise,<br />
Pipe little tunes to them,<br />
To lull them to sleep--<br />
To this gentle place<br />
I came wandering,<br />
Lost and lonely,<br />
Thirsty and hungry,<br />
Cold and naked.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I lay asleep<br />
On the cool mountain-side,<br />
Someone came walking<br />
And stopped when he saw me,<br />
Stooped and softly<br />
Kissed my eyelids,<br />
Whispered a word or two<br />
In my ear as I slept,<br />
‘Wake little brother,<br />
Wake up and talk to me,<br />
Open your eyes<br />
And see if you recognize me.’<br />
So I opened my sleepy eyes,<br />
Rubbed them with my fingers<br />
To clear my sight,<br />
Raised my head<br />
And looked at my brother.<br />
He was standing there<br />
Smiling gently,<br />
But his eyes were shining<br />
With unshed tears.<br />
And I thought I knew him,<br />
Thought I recognized<br />
The calm, strong face,<br />
The clear, loving eyes,<br />
The wide, white forehead,<br />
But I was not sure.<br />
So he spoke to me<br />
In a voice of comfort,<br />
‘My little brother<br />
Do you still not know me?<br />
Have I been so long with you<br />
And still don&apos;t you understand<br />
That I <i>am</i> your brother,<br />
Your lord and master,<br />
Guide, companion<br />
All your days?<br />
I am that Christ<br />
Whom you have crucified,<br />
Neglected, despised,<br />
These many weary years.<br />
You would not help me,<br />
Could not understand,<br />
Confused me with others,

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Note:</i> When he had read these two poems, Dr H--smiled at me
too, in a gentle and affectionate way. ‘You will not go far wrong,’
he said, ‘if you do what this poem tells you.’ He seemed to think

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘There will probably be a period of emptiness followed by an
increasing sense of confidence and peace of mind,’ he said. Alas
for me, he was wrong. For what reason I do not know, but
perhaps because in fact, if not in intention, I ignored the advice
given in the poem, and persisted in trying to get in touch with
the power, the person who spoke in the poems.


At any rate, for whatever reason, the voice which spoke in the poems
began at this point to dominate my thinking and acting more and more,
until it finally took over all my waking hours, and spoke, no longer in
verse, but directly to me, so that I was eventually talking with it all day.
It spoke of course, through my voice so that it would have appeared to
anyone listening that I was holding a ceaseless dialogue with myself.
The strain was very great and grew greater, but I had no choice but to
listen and try to obey, it was never incomprehensible or disordered
delirium, but spoke with an authority which I both feared and trusted.
Nevertheless, apart from my dealings with the voice, I was always
conscious of my surroundings and of other people and able to speak
and act normally although it often cost me a very great effort to do so.
It did of course, sometimes occur to me to doubt the objective reality
of this experience, but never for long, because it was intolerable to me
to do so, the strain of enduring what I went through was only just
made bearable by believing and obeying. How far other people who
knew about it accepted my assumption that I was controlled and
informed by a divine voice is greatly open to doubt, but Dr H --;at
least accepted the possibility that I had knowledge from an abnormal
source, as will be seen later in the case of A--, and he afterwards referred
to me once as ‘a poet and a seer’, laying special stress on the
second word, which I thought strange, coming from a thorough-going
scientist.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>Thursday, July 5</i>. Last night I was very, very tired and I just didn&apos;t
know what to think. Today I have more confidence and a mild feeling
of exhilaration. While singing the hymn at prayers I suddenly realize
that there is more to come. It is exciting. I begin to see dimly that the
way for me is to resign myself more and more to this direction, not to
worry or make my own plans.


<i>Later</i>. Again loss of confidence, irritation and exhaustion. This means

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>4.30</i>. I start to write a long poem. It is different from the others. It is
taking a form I didn&apos;t expect, namely the threat of imminent danger to
A--. I think it is a personal danger. I think he will do something
desperate. I have been writing for about an hour now, and I cannot get
any answer and I am frightened.


<i>Prayer</i>


I must believe the promise given, hold to this rock, whatever power<br />
Assails or shakes. Patience I seek. Confirm my faith,<br />
So weak, so wavering. Since you have left me, in spite of your comfort,<br />
Your strength and forgiveness, despite your promise, I again am tempted,<br />
Weary, disheartened, doubting, timid, unsure of my way.<br />
O my lord and master, my father and brother,<br />
You who are so gentle, so strong, so sure, remember my weakness.<br />
That I am untried, still beset with many temptations,<br />
Christ, since you have left me, send me your messenger,<br />
Send me your power, your understanding. Without it I waver,<br />
Know not where to turn, grope and falter, stretching out my hands,<br />
Of the many ways with which I am confronted not sure which to take,<br />
Hesitating, wondering. I need reassurance, deeply I need it,<br />
Long for comfort and for guidance. I am perplexed, torn with doubt,<br />
Uncertain of the road, lacking the power to heal the child I sinned against.<br />
Yes, I know you promised that it would be given,<br />
Counselled patience, withdrawal, delay. Christ, my master, is it a sin in me<br />
If I humbly beg you not to delay too long?<br />
I have been so punished, so long bewildered, so long ignorant, doubtful,
despairing,<br />
Turned all ways at once, never seeing clearly what would be the end<br />
Of my mysterious journey. Lord, I pray to you, grant me this one gift<br />
Send me the token of your promise and power.<br />
Truly I kneel to you, empty, humble, and I must fall again<br />
If you do not help me. I have no reward, nothing of my own to give,<br />
Nothing but my deep need, mine, and the child&apos;s,<br />
Only for him I beg, beseech you with tears to save him quickly.<br />
I am so afraid of the danger which threatens,<br />
One single sign from you, that is all I ask.<br />
One sure message, Lord, let it come to me, send it soon now,<br />
For I am afraid. My hands tremble. I feel unworthy.<br />
All too childish for my difficult task.<br />
May I please recall to you the words you spoke to me?<br />
‘I will heal him, you and him together.’<br />
I am so fearful, so incompetent, so faithless, so changeable,

<i>Note:</i> I have written this long prayer in a rough verse form,
because of its more or less rhythmical regularity, but is obviously
different from the other poems. For one thing it is a deliberate,
conscious appeal or prayer for help, and though written under
great tension, contains, unlike the others, no unconscious imagery
or anything unexpected except for the strange message at
the end. This message itself is unusual because for the first time
it is an explicit direction about an immediate, practical personal
situation.


Thus from now on the whole focus of my attention shifts from the
remote, archetypal world of the previous poems to the immediate
present and I begin to believe implicitly that I can get direct answers to
prayers through the automatic writing. I notice how long and what an
immense effort it took for me to get this response to my prayer. It was
as though the power to whom I appealed was very reluctant to answer
my petition, but in the end gave way to my importunity and, in effect,
said, ‘Very well, since you want it so much, you shall have it, but you
must take the consequences.’


I should explain here, too, that because of my representations to
the authorities, A--had ceased to be a boarder in the school, and was

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Diary continued:</i>


When I received this message, I thought of showing it to Dr H-- but
immediately the Voice most peremptorily said, ‘No, do <i>not</i> show this to
anyone but the child. Don&apos;t mention it to anyone. Solemnly I tell
you, you must <i>not</i> show this till I give you permission.’


I knew that A-- had a room and I knew that he had a white wireless
set. I did <i>not</i> know that the room was reached by a stairway behind
the garden, or that he kept his wireless set on a table with a dagger
lying beside it. I don&apos;t know what the communication means. This
afternoon I showed the message to A-- as instructed. He didn&apos;t appear
to take it seriously. He said he would disobey the instructions to
see what would happen. I have a feeling that if he does, something
disastrous will happen, because the sense of danger and urgency was
very strong. But what else to think I do not know. I receive a further
message as follows--
<blockquote>
<p>
This will be enough to tell him at present,<br />
This is the sign I send, this is the token<br />
For which you begged me.<br />
This will convince him that you are right.
</p>
</blockquote>


This will be enough to tell him at present,<br />
This is the sign I send, this is the token<br />
For which you begged me.<br />
This will convince him that you are right.


This seems explicit enough. Yet I am uneasy. Anyway I did what I was
told. I did the best I could. I was rather irritated by A--&apos;s reception
of the message. Certainly I shall not send for him again unless I get
precise instructions to do so.


<i>Note:</i> I had not seen much of A--, since he had become a day
boy and he did not then know what had been happening to me,
or about the poems and the Voice. I had to give him the message
hurriedly and more or less in public before he left the school to
catch a train home. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that he
was at first puzzled by this ‘message’ out of the blue, which I had
no time to explain co him, and perhaps at first amused. But many
months later he told me that he did in fact take it very seriously
and observed the prohibition exactly. To make the narrative
in the diary clearer I should also say that some time before A--
had visited me and borrowed money to pay a visit to B--1.
He had once lived there and seemed fascinated by the underworld

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Diary continued:</i>


All this was very tiring (the writing of the prayer and the message)
and I think may be dangerous.


I keep on thinking of A--&apos;s brother (he had a younger brother who
greatly looked up to him). Why do I think of him? Because, as far as
I can understand, the <i>physical</i> danger is to his brother. I think if
A-- disregards the message, the warning, he will throw the dagger,
probably at a hen tied up in some way (he told me he had been torturing
hens) and it will be deflected and hit his brother in the eye. None
of this is very clear to me but I seem to get a visual image of a barn,
some hay, an old brown boot and an old bath, as the scene where
this will take place.


I think that A-- has decided to take revenge for his failure with the
girl at B--1, by torturing a hen (also perhaps an unconscious symbol
of his mother) and I think that this accident may happen, and that
his brother may lose the sight of his eye. This is a dreadful thought,
and I do pray that it won&apos;t take place, but I have done everything I
could and been most solemnly enjoined to do nothing more and to tell
no one, till instructed.


<i>5.30</i>. Another message:
<blockquote>
<p>

<i>Note:</i> After this the time sequence as noted in the diary, becomes
rather confused. But I remember that I expected the disaster
connected with A--&apos;s brother, if it happened at all, to happen on
Saturday. Later, as I received more detailed information from
the Voice, I expected it to happen on Sunday night. Between
Thursday and Saturday, when I could say nothing to anyone of
my fears, the anxiety and tension increased.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>Friday morning, July 6</i>. Instructions--get off teaching, walk to the
village and buy some coffee.


<i>10.5</i>. Set out on foot to buy coffee, told to walk slowly. Took half
an hour. Think I was sent out to miss something that happened in the
School at 10.20. All this is tiring, torturing, but I do it. Return. Told
now to make a cup of coffee and go slowly. Right. <i>See no one</i>. Relax
for a little. Smoke.


<i>11.10</i>. Two lines:
<blockquote>
<p>
Why do you weep, child, why do you weep?<br />
There is nothing to cry for.
</p>
</blockquote>


Why do you weep, child, why do you weep?<br />
There is nothing to cry for.


<i>11.20</i>. Message tells me someone tall, with a stammer, will come to
me, tells me what to say. Tells me to stay here. Tells me to wait.
It is so hard to wait. I feel lonely and frightened and weak.


<i>4.30</i>. Went on waiting all these hours, nothing happens. I get more and
more anxious. At about 3 o&apos;clock try to get another message. Have
a kind of convulsion, mind goes blank, can&apos;t think, can&apos;t believe,
can&apos;t do anything. Only the phrase, ‘body trodden by the bird’, over
and over. Then I fall asleep for about half an hour and wake up again
feeling calm, though tired and rather blank. Still nothing happens. I
suppose I must just wait until something does. Ate some bread out of
turn (i.e. without permission from the Voice) for which I hope I shall
be forgiven. I really thought I was going out of my head. That at least
is averted, for the time being anyway. Still don&apos;t know what to think
or what to believe.


<i>8.30</i>. Still nothing happens, except that after supper, when I suddenly
decided to go and see W-- and try to explain to him what was

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

‘The bird treads your body’<br />
This was to give you<br />
A rest from the heavy load<br />
Which you are carrying.


<i>Note:</i> ‘Fit’ is an inadequate word to describe this experience,
which later, in a great variety of forms, I became very familiar
with. It was really a series of convulsive movements like exercises
and massage, mixed up with a great many ritualistic and symbolic
movements and repetitions of numbers carried out compulsively.
I came to think that it had a therapeutic effect on various nerve
centres. I have tried to describe it in more detail later in this book.
At this time I associated it with the Holy Ghost and regarded it as
a ritual cleansing and strengthening.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>Saturday morning, July 7</i>. I hope I am doing the right thing. I feel
more and more a heavy burden of responsibility, but also that I am
being helped and guided. Again it all centres round A--, and it
must be quite dreadful, for though I don&apos;t yet know what it is, it
makes me weep as I write this. I think it is some form of diabolical
torture connected with the rabbit.


<i>Note:</i> Some days before I had noticed a young rabbit being kept
in a box by someone in A--&apos;s classroom. I thought now that A--
would get hold of this rabbit and use it in the same way as he had
the hen, by tying it up and throwing his knife at it (I had no
direct evidence for any of this except a previous statement from
A--that he had been torturing hens). I thought that he
would use the rabbit as a male substitution symbol, as the hen
was a female symbol. The idea is not perhaps so wildly fanciful
if the reader knows that A-- had a bitter feud against the school
chaplain, whom he loathed and detested and that the chaplain&apos;s
nickname was ‘Bunny’. One very strange circumstance is that

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remember him telling me that he had a tennis ball fastened
to a length of cord and hung from a beam, and that this he
belaboured savagely with a racket for hours on end. Inside the
tennis ball was God, and thus A-- got some of his own back for
God&apos;s cruelty to him. I could not laugh at such a story, I found it
terrifying.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


I feel I must keep in seclusion as much as I possibly can, at least till A--
has gone home. <i>I must not see him or talk to him</i>.


<i>12.30</i>. Somewhere in the wilds in my faithful car, I think I must get
back to school at about 1.45. Get some petrol as I go back
When I get back, I must go up to my room, re-read the instructions,
perhaps write them out in the book. I think I may hear about A--
maybe at 5 o&apos;clock. If so I shall go to him and take the poems with me.
If necessary get Dr H--. Meanwhile wait. God give me strength. Keep
away from people.


<i>Later: 1 o&apos;clock</i>. My instructions are changed. I am told to go straight
back to school and to look at the Lower Fifth papers on the table.
(These were exercises and essays set them as work in my absence.)

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

(1) No or (the answer is No).


(2) Let&apos;s eat this food.


That seems quite explicit. We have got to go through with it. God
help us. I think I shall have to be out of my room for a little while. I
shall go up to my bedroom and lock the door, till I am told to come
down.


Another sentence in A--&apos;s papers, which is not part of the exercise,
but is written in capital letters at the bottom:


YE FOOLS AND BLIND!


<i>1.30</i>. I have told Dr H-- as much as I was permitted and he will be
ready if needed.


<i>Note:</i> I think that I paid one of my regular visits to Dr H-- that
morning and in the course of the interview had hinted that I was
afraid that a dangerous crisis was approaching in A--&apos;s life and
had asked him to be ready that evening in case anything happened.
Dr H-- naturally wanted to know more but when I told
him that I had been absolutely forbidden by the Voice to say any
more at present, he accepted the fact, and told me where I could
reach him on the telephone if necessary.


<i>Diary continued:</i>


A fourth sentence in A--&apos;s exercise is pointed out to me.


I start work at 8 o&apos;clock.


Does this mean what I think it does ? If so I must make arrangements
to stop it. Dr H---&apos;s telephone numbers: 7 o&apos;clock to 8 o&apos;clock.
T-- 3958. 9 p.m. onwards, H-- 234. ‘You are not alone,’ said Dr
H--. More and more I feel this. Alone I could not do it.


<i>1.25</i>. At 1.35 He (the Voice) says ‘Finish the cigarette, then you may
go down. (I was locked in my bedroom.) Copy in the poems. Do
nothing in a hurry. I will look after you.’


<i>9 p.m</i>. Nothing happens. I am very tired and I am afraid, afraid of the
strain of this. I have been expecting something since 8 o&apos;clock. Have
I got the days wrong or is it all just a disordered mind? I just can&apos;t
believe that. Another day of this kind of thing will finish me. I don&apos;t
know what to do. I shall try to get some rest. If anything did happen

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>12 o&apos;clock Midnight</i>. There comes this message:

Buried in the garden<br />
Under the apple tree!<br />

<i>Diary continued:</i>


<i>Sunday, July 8. 6.30 a.m</i>. I wake up and I begin to realize almost
the whole chain of events and I weep very bitterly for my child A--
given over to darkness and devils. I know that what I always feared
is true. He is going mad. Now I must get up and be quite sure that I
get all the evidence and that I ring up Dr H-- early enough to be
sure of getting him. <i>I must see him this morning</i>. The whole thing
becomes more and more strange and it also gets very terrible. The
New Messiah. The Avenger. This is what A-- called himself. I didn&apos;t
take it seriously then.


Somewhere in his room is a book or diary of his plans and thoughts,
all written down.

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697830-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>On no account must I see him</i>. He&apos;ll know at once that I know and
that I know everything.


He will first take the poison and give some to his mother (in sweets?
sugar?) then he will try to kill his brother. O God!


<i>Later</i>. ‘Look at his essay.’ I look at it. It is haphazard. The
quotations from the Bible, an odd mixture. Two opposing forces at
work. Again at the end in a totally different writing the word
‘armageddon’. The end of the world. The end of A--&apos;s world
anyway.


Look at the violent change in his feeling for his mother. Now
she is a bitch. (That&apos;s what he called her to me.) He loathes her.
He hates her. He has been torturing hens. The hen has been symbolizing
his mother up to now. He told me he had been torturing them.
Last time I saw him he told me he had given it up. ‘It was’, he said, ‘a
rather crude way of doing things.’ Now he has turned his attention
to his real mother.


The trip to the city represents a kind of dedicated journey to
make ready for the sacrifice. A-- thinks he is God or the Devil, the
only true God. His hatred against the chaplain and any of God&apos;s
official representatives is bitter and intense and <i>it has been growing
worse and worse</i>.


The trip to the city which I financed (God help me) was to get ready
for the sacrifice. I am right. I know it. It will take place today. ‘I
start work at eight o&apos;clock!’


It must surely, somehow, be prevented, or is it all wild, insane
delusions? This is my real difficulty.


It is unthinkable that his mother should die and that he should
take poison, but the poem specifically says that if he does not heed
the warning, his brother will be injured and disaster fall upon him,
<i>and it cannot be prevented</i>. Must hope for more light on this soon.


<i>9.15</i>. I ring up Dr H-- and make an appointment. Thank God for
him. Oh, poor A--, so lost, so lost.


<i>10 o&apos;clock</i>. Another message.


‘Tell H-- when he gets there (A--&apos;s home)<br />
To go into the garden<br />
By the little gothic gate.<br />
Tell him he will find the child<br />
Under the apple tree<br />
Digging up his treasure.<br />
Tell him to speak to him<br />
Gently, secretly,<br />
No one else knowing,

<i>Note:</i> Here the diary ends. I remember that I rang up Dr H-- on
Sunday morning and asked him as a matter of the gravest urgency
to make an appointment for me to see him. He agreed to see me
almost at once. I got into my car to go into the town to keep the
appointment, and as I was turning out of the school drive, I
almost ran into A--, who was coming in on his bicycle. The sight
of him was a very great shock to me. Since Thursday, when I had
given him the message, I had been strictly enjoined by the Voice
to have no contact whatever with him, and this chance meeting
seemed to me extremely ominous. Fortunately the car was still
moving and I was able to avoid having to do more than raise my
hand in greeting as we passed, but I felt very much frightened and
shaken as I proceeded on my way. I showed the Doctor all the
messages and my conclusions recorded in the diary. I told him
that I believed that A-- was out of his mind and that he must go
out on some pretext to the child&apos;s home that evening before
eight o&apos;clock, as instructed in the message, prepared if necessary
to take action to prevent the terrible occurrences which I
feared.


Dr H-- did not attempt to argue with me. He seemed quite
prepared to believe that I might very well be right, and to
act on my foreknowledge. He told me that he was himself very
