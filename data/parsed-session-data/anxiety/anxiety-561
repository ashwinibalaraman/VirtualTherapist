BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay so [PATIENT NAME] looking back at your chart you were here about three months ago?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And just give me an idea how things feel like they've been coming along over all since then?
<b>PT:</b> Um, well I've, I've been I, I would say there's been a lot of stress, family things, and um, I don't know if I told you this last time, maybe not, but since I saw you my brother um, his company closed and um, so that's been stressful.  Um the good part is, is that I guess you could say it's two fold, the good part is I'm, you know, spending time, more time now with my um, my little nephew who's going to be one soon and then my niece who um, I've always been really close to.  Um and my brother is a stay at home dad now until he gets a new job.  But that's been really stressful, I mean, um, for everybody.  But again that's the, it's weird but that's the one thing that being with [NAME OTHER] and my, my nephew um, that makes me feel better when I get these episodes when I get um, really stressed out and anxious.  Um, they just bring me back more in to focus.  I feel better -
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> About things, I really do.  Um, but I admit that I've had episodes where I've still, I've had a hard time sleeping at night uh, I get, I'm, I'm not tired until like maybe 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.  Um, because I just, you know, um maybe because if there's things running through my head um, but it's almost like I get this second burst of energy.  Uh, and then the other thing is I've had episodes where um, I'm not going to say they were panic attacks but like anxiety attacks more, more or less.  Uh, just worrying about financial things that again, I, I, I mentioned this to you before when I get myself in to trouble with spending, you know, a lot of spending and I, it doesn't mean I do it all the time but when I do it I can do a lot of damage.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> A lot of damage and um, and then it's like I, I, I get better and I, I get a handle on it and then when the stress builds up, for whatever reason, uh, it's like that's when I tend to do those kind of things.  I, I, I, you know, spend money on things uh, not necessarily for myself either.  It just, it's something that like happens and it usually like uh, it's almost like uh, it's more of an impulsive thing.  It's not like you plan it, you don't say "I'm going to go to the store and do this."  Uh, but I was proud of myself actually yesterday because I was coming home from my mom's house uh, I spent Mother's Day with her and I had this urge because I was feeling upset about some things -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> My family and uh, other worries and I had this urge to just like, um, eat a bunch of food because well that's the other thing.  If I get really upset I know, I get cravings for things.  But, what I, what I ended up doing was I was, I just drove for a while and the more I drove it, it was like I was able to, to get past that.  It was really hard -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I was able to, it was like um, uh, yeah and I was proud of myself.  I was, I, when I got home I drank a cup of um, tea that I bought that I really love, apricot tea, uh, and then I though "okay, you know, this is good" um, but it, because it was, it's a comfort when you do things like that.  I think, I'm, I'm seeing like a parallel between when I do these things.  It's like a release in a way but then later you, you just, you, you realize what you've done and then it makes you feel really terrible; because you realize that you've lost control.  But doing that yesterday uh, yeah, because I've tried other things, you know, I've tried wa, I've, I've, you know, I walk and that tends to help too.  Um, the walking I do and like I said "being with my niece and nephew" that helps.  Um, being with my boyfriend helps but he's been going through some real difficult things.  So that's added stress and, and it's difficult for me at times to like remove myself from those situations.  In stead of just saying "okay, you know what, that's their thing and they have to, you know, find a way to deal with it."  Um, and I have to have faith that that's going to, it's going to work out.  But that's sometimes when I get obsessive thinking and I just can't get it out of my mind.  It's like what another thing and another thing, and another thing.  It's like when is it going to end and that's when I tend to do these destructive things.  Uh, and [NAME OTHER] and I have talked about it a lot; because, because for a while she was saying like, "What is triggering, what you think triggers you to do those things?"  And the one thing that came to mind was when I, I feel like really helpless and when I get really depressed and when I get really scared and anxious.  Um and I don't, I think maybe, maybe, maybe this is something you can relate to, it's also the lack of sleep doesn't help.
<b>DR:</b> How often is the lack of sleep -
<b>PT:</b> A lot.
<b>DR:</b> Giving you trouble?
<b>PT:</b> It's been, it's been a problem for probably ever since I've seen, you know, seen you it's been a -
<b>DR:</b> Years?
<b>PT:</b> Years, the last, I would say the last, maybe ever since I was diagnosed.  But these, this past year um, it's really like, I've noticed a toll that it's taking on me and I really think that contributes to uh, when I have this, this sense of like, more like doom not doom but like, like [NAME OTHER] said that catastrophic thinking.  Because you, you just, it sort of makes sense; because you are sleep deprived, your, your judgements off.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> And, and I, I really, I, I really see now that when your, when I'm not getting enough sleep, which is like every night, um, that it just really affects, yeah, it's like you can't handle stress like you would if you were getting more sleep; because we, there's healthy stress and that's good, you know, it helps you do things.  But I think that's what has contributed the fact that when I do these things because I just am like exhausted, you know, but the past couple of days.  Um, I, I've got, I've been able to sleep a little bit more.  Last night I was, I, I know it sounds not good to you but I feel asleep around 3:00 [LAUGHING], which is better than 5:00.  Uh, [LAUGHING] -
<b>DR:</b> Every little bit helps.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly.  So that's two additional hours of sleep.  But um, yeah it's been going on a lot.  So I would say this past year especially.
<b>DR:</b> You've been on Seroquel in the past.  Is it any diff, different or more difficult sleeping since you've been off the Seroquel or is it still about the same?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's about the same.  But you, truthfully and I'll, I'll be honest with you.  Um, I, I wasn't always taking the three times a day, the Klonopin.  Um, because well sometimes it was because I didn't bring a pill with me when I was baby sitting, um, and I thought, you know, I'm okay like taking just two.  Um there were times that I, I would take the three but I have to say when, if I spaced them at a certain time like at last night, um, I was at my moms house.  So I was able to take one, I think it was around like 11:00, and um, then I felt more relaxed inside.  So I think uh -
<b>DR:</b> So that middle dose makes a difference?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I really and when I don't take it I really need to commit to doing that.  I need to bring it with me uh, because I now originally the dosages was 2 um, but even if I take 2 1/2 that, I do that sometimes, but now that I think about it when I've taken it the third one um, the last couple of days I've been more relaxed in the evening.  So, to, you know -
<b>DR:</b> To unwind a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, unwind my thoughts and not to like obsess.
<b>DR:</b> Have you gone through any periods that you can recollect of uh, sig, significant manic period of time?
<b>PT:</b> It's the, it's the spending part, yeah.  Um, it was a couple of weeks ago uh, and I ended up buying this uh, exercise thing and, and the funny thing about it is, well it's not funny, but it's not even my type of thing that I like; because it's like this mini tramp, it' not a trampoline exactly, but it's the thing where you can do um, like all kinds of cardio things on it.  But I'm, I was thinking about it all day long and then um, I had the number and part of me was like what, that's not even really your type of thing that you'd enjoy.  Then the more I went back to it and I, it's like again, I thought, "oh this would be, you know what there's so many success stories about it, it's different.  It's not boring" and then I, I ended up purchasing it.  Now the good news is I'm going to return it but that was like 100 some dollars right there and then I made other purchases that week.  Um, uh, let's see I think I bought some gifts for people, ordered them, um, and I actually when I got them uh, I opened them up and everything and it was like well this isn't a good one anyway that I purchased because it was a pendent for somebody and it uh, didn't turn out to be what I thought it was.  So I'm going to return that but I, yeah, I would say I ended up spending couple, a couple hundred dollars maybe more.  It just a bunch of things, they weren't big things but the one was.  I, I and, and part of it was because I because a lot, I again I, I just I get these things where I just, it's like, it's like you just do these things, you know, um and then you look at the damage and it's like "God why did I do this again."  Um and I still have the same problems, it didn't, the problems didn't, it didn't make them go away.  It, it didn't make the financial part any better.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it feels good for a few minutes but in the long run it's not good.
<b>PT:</b> No, it's not good and, and you just, and then you feel worse about yourself, you know, um, but like I said "yesterday was a good thing."  It and I guess that's the thing to remember is that even the small thing that's, that's uh, that's a positive thing.  Just the fact that I got away from that and I just did whatever I could to stop it um, and uh, yeah I mean, that's, that's something, I guess to, to say okay I know it might be small to somebody else but I, I didn't do what the impulse was because it is so strong.
<b>DR:</b> You need small successes to build more confidence and more success in the future.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, exactly, exactly and maybe that's the thing I've had some success but I think it's like maybe that's the thing.  I need to keep on reminding myself of those success and not and also to forgive myself for when I, I do those things and it's like it's not too late because you can fix them.  I mean I can't fix what I've done before, there's a lot of financial damage.  I can't correct that over night, it's because there's too much of it.  But, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Are you seeing your therapist on a weekly basis these days?
<b>PT:</b> No, um, every two weeks -
<b>DR:</b> Every two weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Every two weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Any trouble you've had with your regular medications everyday other than that middle dose on the Klonopin?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't think so.  Uh, and I guess my question sort of was that because we increased the um, wait a minute which one is it over the time I've seen you.  Which is the one we increased?  Was it the Pristiq?
<b>DR:</b> We may have done that a while ago, um, yeah about six months ago.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We went from 50 mg up to 100 -
<b>PT:</b> Right and, and um, the, the Pristiq is, I forget which one you told me is the one that really helps you feel like you're um, in a sense helps you with those more of those moments, those up and down moments.  Is it the Lamictal or is the combination of the Pristiq or -
<b>DR:</b> The Pristiq is an antidepressant -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The Lamictal is the mood stabilizer for the mood swings -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> The highs and the lows.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And uh the Klonopin is just to calm things down.
<b>PT:</b> The anxiety and stuff.  That part I know but um, yeah I was just, you know, thinking about that and a little bit and I don't think it's I want to change the medicines at all um, and, and I think the other thing is, is that with the weather getting better that, that's helped to.  It's so, it's so great when I can take my niece and my nephew for walks and I, you know, can take the dogs for, the dog for a long walk and um, when I was feeling that way though the depressed part and anxious.  It was like I wanted to bury myself like in this, you know, you want to just fold yourself up and you want to like, you feel like you need protected, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And you get scared of things and I think it, though it didn't help when the weather was kind of dreary.  But in a weird way it's almost like when the weather started to get nice I was, I was almost like I wish it would get dreary again.  When I was feeling like that and, and it's weird because you would think "Oh, I'm so happy" it's looking, it's nice outside.  But I wasn't feeling that way I, I was like scared and I wanted to still stay in my little shell.  But over the past couple weeks um, I'm more like it's uh, you know, it does feel good.  The sun shine feels good -
<b>DR:</b> There's real science behind the fact that the sun can help with the mood.  The seasonal weather effective disorder is not a myth, it's, it's a real thing.  Getting a little sunshine can help bring things up -
<b>PT:</b> It right, but why is it then even, it like now again because it takes time to feel that, the effect because I was scared to like, you know what I mean, like to go out in a way.  To go out there and um, you know do the things that, that you normally would want to do like, I don't know, like to run errands.  Go to the drug store because you have to do it, take walks and stuff I was actually like scared, you know, to do those things and now I don't feel like that.  Now I'm feeling better again, is that still because I was still feeling the effects of that -
<b>DR:</b> From the preceding months sure.  It's uh hurdle, a hump that you have to get over and -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Start pushing yourself -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Once you do it for a little while -
<b>PT:</b> No -
<b>DR:</b> Some of the chemistry the sunlight comes through your eyes and back in to your brain and starts making some chemical reactions go on -
<b>PT:</b> So that's why I'm -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay, so that's, but that's normal that I was feeling not normal but that I was feeling like that hump that I, you know, getting over because it doesn't like just like that.
<b>DR:</b> Not that fast.  It's a process.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay because I know you told me and the seasonal thing and I really believe you because uh, that's when, that's when all these things have happened.  The spending, the urges, the compulsions -
<b>DR:</b> It goes along with feeling depressed and those are things that people reach for that seem to make them feel better for a minute even though we know the long term consequences aren't always positive.
<b>PT:</b> No they're not, they're not, it's like uh, yeah like, it's almost like a uh, like a little child that holds on to a blanky or something -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, a security blanket.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.  Now do you know if you have much of your Klonopin left from skipping some of those middle doses?
<b>PT:</b> No and you know, you know what happened is um, I, I had um, I had forgotten from my prescription that you had written be, the, the whatever months ago.  Um, I still have a refill, two refills on that one before and I know I had given the drug store, I swear that I gave them the new prescription, you know, that you gave me.  Um, but anyway uh, they said I didn't, um, they didn't have it.  So I do definitely need now on all them.  Um, I still have some, believe it or not, from the, the old prescription, I still have a few left of those; because I wasn't taking the three.
<b>DR:</b> You may have a few left over and, and that's okay to not be right down to the very last one.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking any other medication from any other doctors right now?
<b>PT:</b> No, just the Nasonex.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just the Nasonex and, and again I take the multivitamins I talked to you about.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Um, and um, no that's, that's it that's the only prescription and I take aspirin once a day, one a day, that's -
<b>DR:</b> So nothing drastic has changed in terms of your pills or your health?
<b>PT:</b> No, except for like I said, I, I was feeling to the point where also my energy, I felt like somebody took uh, I was like a balloon and literally all the air just was like sucked out of me and I was just, it was really bad, a bad feeling and it wasn't just a feeling, literally my body was like I couldn't, I mean I had function but it was like I could barely get through the day, you know, I just wanted to -
<b>DR:</b> That's, that's what depression feels like when you're going through it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I remember what it was like when I was, you know, um, when I suffered from really deep, deep depression.  But, I, I guess I was kind of confused in the symptoms.  I was thinking maybe there was just something, you know, missing like uh, uh, uh a mineral or something.  But I don't think that's really what it necessarily was.  Maybe it was more just the symptoms of the depression and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> They get better and they get worse over time.  Nothing ever stays the same.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know that as well as anybody -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Having been through it.
<b>PT:</b> Right but I was trying other things too, I was trying things, trying different minerals, substances, maybe I was thinking okay this will help.  But it seemed like nothing, you know what I mean, was really making that much of a difference.  Even though I was adjusting, I was adding more and more good things, um and like I said to you just the last couple of weeks or so uh, the energy level has got better.
<b>DR:</b> And I would hope we can hang on to that through the spring and the summer months.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's certainly our goal.
<b>PT:</b> I want to.
<b>DR:</b> So I need to give you three refills, all three of your prescriptions and I think we're at a spot where I'm going to spread it out from a three to a four month -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Refill.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If something comes up you can always give a call sooner.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But I'm going to refill all three of them and here's the prescriptions for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And you know how to get in touch with me if you have any troubles and you have [NAME OTHER] here in the -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Background too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm going to see her next week.
<b>DR:</b> So if all goes well I'll see you in early September.
<b>PT:</b> Wow.
<b>DR:</b> We'll, we'll encourage you to get out and get as much of that sunshine and enjoy the summer as much as possible.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah yeah, I, I think it is, it's, it's really, there's no question that the sunshine is, is really helpful.  It helps make a difference.
<b>DR:</b> Don't forget that, [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> No, I know and especially now with the, like I said, separating like myself from obsessing about other peoples, like because you love them, you know, your family and your friends.  But -
<b>DR:</b> Wait.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay, but that's where I get in to trouble.  I think too, I know I do and I'm, I'm trying really hard to, to like set boundaries and stop myself from doing that.  But it's really hard to do and sometimes it's like I, you know, it just, yeah, it goes in my head and I can't get those thoughts out of my head and the only thing I do, I found that does help besides getting outside is I have a lot of spiritual like uh, messages around and if I pick them up and I read them it gives me some comfort and even if it doesn't last forever.  It just for those, it's kind of does sit in your head and you're like, "Okay, you know that's true, God you know, is God is watching over me and he's watching over them."  And I just have to faith that, like he knows.  He knows, he has a master plan -
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> And, and I believe that it just that when my thoughts get carried away -
<b>DR:</b> I think that so much of the depression people go through is uh, lack of spirituality, a lack of purpose and direction and if you can give yourself those little reminders then you pick it up a notch from time to time it really can get you through.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I'm, I'm a very spir, spiritual person and I have so much faith that's what's sad sometimes because you do have all that faith but when you, like you said when you do get really depressed it's like you're maybe it's your judgment your, no matter how much faith you can have sometimes it's like you start to, to doubt things and uh but I think yeah I'm going to keep on, you know, getting outside and, you know, and do you advise that I do take the three Klonopin a day?
<b>DR:</b> I'm not going to hold it against you if you're doing well and you don't need the third one, I'm but as long as it's helping I don't, I don't want to stop you from doing it.  Just remember Klonopin is an addictive pill and we don't want to over do it but, but I think we're in trouble -
<b>PT:</b> But -
<b>DR:</b> Taking a small dose three times a day.
<b>PT:</b> No, not only that because I've been on it for a long time and I'm one of those people that, like I said "I sometimes just take two a day" -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I've never like just have this desire to like pop them.
<b>DR:</b> And there maybe days where 2 is enough or 2 1/2 -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But we're okay if we sit at the three for the most part and that's what I gave you on the prescription.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and, and part of things is because I wasn't consistent, you know, maybe during those winter months that might have been a good thing to keep on doing that -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Like in the morning I always did it, sometimes in the afternoon I didn't do it and maybe that's part of the thing that happened because I was only doing morning and night.  So who knows, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Well we'll see how we get through the summer.  Hopefully it will be a little easier to get through the summer but you got three of them there if you need them.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So yeah I'll talk to you back here in four months will be September -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Have [NAME OTHER] put us down for time there and -
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> If anything comes up let me know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, thank you, yeah and I enjoy doing this actually.  I didn't, I didn't even notice it was, you know, we were doing this but it was good.
<b>DR:</b> I appreciate your, your volunteering.
<b>PT:</b> No, I, I enjoyed it but if it helps in anyway I, I think it's important.
<b>DR:</b> So.
