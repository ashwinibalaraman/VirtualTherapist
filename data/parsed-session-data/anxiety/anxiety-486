BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How are you doing?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I've had a problem. I was in Florida all week. I almost lost my mother.
<b>DR:</b> What happened?
<b>PT:</b> Well, she's 95 and, uh, my sister called me up telling me she was all disoriented. She was not acting right. And, um, I was in Florida in about 5 hours. Found out that the doctor was giving her 10mg of Ambien at 10 at night and 3 in the morning. She couldn't sleep.
<b>DR:</b> That's not standard treatment. And so she was getting loopy.
<b>PT:</b> And she was not speaking and she was dehydrated. And she had had minor heart failure about a month ago. And I didn't go down because for the first time my sister said she was going to take care of it because she's an hour away. So after they said that, um, her carotid arteries are okay and she's 95 and she has a stent in her leg for circulation and so what I did is, um, I got her on the doctors and she's now taking double mint mints at 10 and at 3 'cause the other doctor wanted to give her Benadryl, 5mg twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Whatever. Let's not spend our time on her.
<b>PT:</b> So I had a bad week. I've had a bad week. 
<b>DR:</b> But she's better?
<b>PT:</b> But she's all better.
<b>DR:</b> All right. Fine. That's all that matters. Uh, November 5th I saw you. Your mood was fine. You weren't very anxious. Your appetite was high. You broke your toe. Can't exercise. Not suicidal. Some hopelessness, helplessness. Getting pleasure from your grandchildren. Not really belly laughs. Some flatness, some anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> I have a lot of anxiety right now.
<b>DR:</b> We thought you were doing okay on really just the BuSpar, Lamictal, and Klonopin, correct?
<b>PT:</b> You asked me to have my blood work done. I brought you the blood work. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They supposedly did, um, it's supposedly thyroid. I don't see it anywhere.
<b>DR:</b> How has your mood been in these 6 weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I've had to increase the Klonopin. I've had a lot more anxiety. But I don't know if that's from the pill that I have to take for my mouth.
<b>DR:</b> What do you have to take for your mouth?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know the name of it. The, uh.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, your thyroid is, uh, it's okay.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause she said that may be why the weight is staying on. 'Cause I swam 20 laps every day in Florida and there was no difference.
<b>DR:</b> You hotter than other people or colder than other people?
<b>PT:</b> I'm warm all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Lab tests are fine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. Good. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. In these 6 weeks you've had a higher anxiety level?
<b>PT:</b> That [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was supposed to call you 'cause they added that pill for the numbness.
<b>DR:</b> Which one, Neurontin?
<b>PT:</b> No. It was, she called you. I don't know what it is. She spoke to you before.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] for the trigeminal neuralgia.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. And you said that it would.
<b>DR:</b> Tegretol.
<b>PT:</b> I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Was it Tegretol. Yeah, no, I was in agreement.
<b>PT:</b> So I don't know if that's causing.
<b>DR:</b> Are you taking that? Can make you tired.
<b>PT:</b> I'm only tired 'cause the week I put in. I don't feel more tired. I don't know if that's making me more anxious, but I am, the anxiety level. In fact, if you have any Klonopin samples I need one right now and I forgot the bottle at home.
<b>DR:</b> We never get samples of anti-anxiety medicines.
<b>PT:</b> I'll have to go home and get it. The anxiety level, I usually have to take one in the day and I never had to do that before.
<b>DR:</b> So how much Klonopin you taking every day?
<b>PT:</b> Two in the morning, 1 in the afternoon.
<b>DR:</b> Two of the 0.5s in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Right. One in the afternoon, and 2 at night.
<b>DR:</b> So one, 0.5, one. And you're also taking the Lamictal and BuSpar?
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes I have to take an extra BuSpar. I don't know if that does any good, but sometimes I really get.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it can. And the Lamictal's still at 100?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I don't play with that one because I don't know what that does. I know it's an antidepressant so I don't play with that.
<b>DR:</b> And it's a mood stabilizer. Does the higher dose of BuSpar help?
<b>PT:</b> It calms me down in the afternoon. It does.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sad?
<b>PT:</b> No, just anxious.
<b>DR:</b> Are you irritable?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] fear sometimes?
<b>PT:</b> Not at anybody else.
<b>DR:</b> How's [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] good. He went off the, um, anti [INAUDIBLE]. We had 2 weeks to know if he was going to make it. And he made it. Now I can be mean to him again.
<b>DR:</b> Nothing relapsed?
<b>PT:</b> No. Knock on wood.
<b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> Um, that's the thing. I don't eat much.
<b>DR:</b> So it's low, but you're not losing weight?
<b>PT:</b> I'm gaining. In fact, I'm staying about here, gaining a little bit. But I am.
<b>DR:</b> Are you exercising?
<b>PT:</b> Now that with my foot better I'm going to go to the gym.
<b>DR:</b> But so far you haven't been?
<b>PT:</b> The whole week in Florida I swam laps and it didn't make a difference to my metabolism.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping? Sleep well?
<b>PT:</b> More than well. What happens is.
<b>DR:</b> You oversleep?
<b>PT:</b> In the mornings I get up at five o'clock and I take a BuSpar and the Klonopin and then I go back to sleep 'til about 7:30. If I don't, I can't keep my eyes open during the day. And at 7:30 I have to have regular coffee and then I can get up. If I don't do, go back to sleep for those 2 hours or an hour and a half, then I mean like I didn't do it today, I'm spacey. So I could, I could probably sleep all morning.
<b>DR:</b> Is that a rigid timeframe?
<b>PT:</b> Never happened to me before.
<b>DR:</b> Your energy's really low?
<b>PT:</b> Really low.
<b>DR:</b> Some of that may be the Klonopin.
<b>PT:</b> So is my, I mean, I don't have any desire to accomplish or do anything major. No drive.
<b>DR:</b> I don't understand how you can be so anxious and so tired at the same time.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> How can they coexist? Right now you're anxious and tired? So you could fall asleep and yet you're [INAUDIBLE] anxiety? Any suicidal thinking? Are you hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> I feel a little hopeless. I don't feel helpless after what, I had felt helpless, but after what I accomplished this week with my mother, I don't feel hopeless, I mean, helpless.
<b>DR:</b> Helpless. How's your self esteem?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty crappy, mainly because of my weight.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel guilty? Status of your marriage?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was going to get a divorce, but then I figured out my money 'cause we can't sell our house, it's gotta wait.
<b>DR:</b> Why can't you sell the house?
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause the inventory [INAUDIBLE]. So I figured out with a financial person.
<b>DR:</b> So you can't afford the divorce?
<b>PT:</b> Not unless I sell my house. That's going to have to wait. I mean, on disability I don't have, I can't get, increase my income. So that makes me status quo as far as that goes.
<b>DR:</b> Are you upset about that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You were looking forward to it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I was. And I also have to be practical too. I got for psychotherapy 3 times a week and I need it. And I go to you once a month. But they pay for your visits. Psychotherapy, they don't pay for it 3 times a week. And that's his insurance which I would lose. Good insurance because of the company.
<b>DR:</b> Um, are you getting pleasure from anything?
<b>PT:</b> Not even from my grandchildren. I mean, in Florida I went out to dinner with my sister, her son, and her son's little baby and usually I haven't seen this baby since she was born, and I had no desire to interact, and I love babies. That really bothered me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it strikes me that you could probably use an antidepressant. 
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to gain any more weight though. I thought the Lamictal was an antidepressant.
<b>DR:</b> It is, but it's a mood stabilizing antidepressant. It's just, you're not on enough to hold back this, uh, this anxiety, this overwhelming anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> But do all of them put weight on you?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause I can't go any further than I am now. And I don't eat, I don't eat garbage. I mean, it's not enough.
<b>DR:</b> One that definitely doesn't put weight on is Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> But then they, but that made me wired.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> I know somebody on Wellbutrin that's never been thinner. 
<b>DR:</b> Same thing with [INAUDIBLE] probably is not that activating.
<b>PT:</b> But the thing is if I took it can I get used to it or it doesn't?
<b>DR:</b> You should be able to. And we could start at a much lower dose and inch you up slowly. Any of the serotonin medicines, we could try a crumb of Effexor.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no, Effexor made me crazy.
<b>DR:</b> Makes you manic. Well, it makes you manic.
<b>PT:</b> I don't even want, I don't even, I don't even want to look at a pill.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause we know that Effexor gets in there, gets into your mood system. 
<b>PT:</b> It may get into my mood system but I really was a maniac.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I want no part of that. I don't want that to ever happen to me again.
<b>DR:</b> [Physician answers telephone.]
<b>PT:</b> How do you always stay so tanned?
<b>DR:</b> I travel a lot. I get into the sunshine.
<b>PT:</b> Good for you. I'm very jealous. Every time I come your tan is perfect.
<b>DR:</b> I don't work on it. I just, ah, I just  travel a lot. Um, all right. So what do we do for you? Are you in agreement that we need an antidepressant?
<b>PT:</b> I need something to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> An antidepressant, it's not really for sadness. In your case it's for the anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the anxiety. The Klonopin, yknow, I've had to have it in the afternoon. Like right now I have to have it.
<b>DR:</b> I think the best thing for this syndrome was Prozac.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going back.
<b>DR:</b> Not going back, but are you in agreement that Prozac seems to help this?
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> Did you gain weight on other SSRIs?
<b>PT:</b> Did I take any other SSRI?
<b>DR:</b> Didn't we try Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> Lexapro was the same thing as, uh, Effexor. It felt the same way.
<b>DR:</b> Really? When did I try that?
<b>PT:</b> You did put me on Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> Must have been a long time ago.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause I still have a box in the house.
<b>DR:</b> So it was activating? It juiced you up?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh. I think that was the first one you gave me that made me, uh, we never got past the first.
<b>DR:</b> Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think we did Zoloft. Will the Zoloft make you gain weight?
<b>DR:</b> Anything can do anything. And people have different reactions to different things.
<b>PT:</b> But if I took Wellbutrin, could I get used to it?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> If I hung in there.
<b>DR:</b> Especially with Klonopin and especially if we start with a very low dose and give you some time to adapt to it. The nice thing about Wellbutrin is, one, it's weight neutral. Two, it's sex neutral.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, that's great.
<b>DR:</b> Three, right, it doesn't give you any orgasm problem. Three, it's energizing. It's juice. It probably regulates dopamine which is the chemical of drive and motivation and pleasure and energy.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I need. I don't have any pleasure.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. So, um, but we're a little affected by the fact that when we gave it to you, you were jumping out of your skin. Now I think I gave it to you at the 150 dose, and so now I'll give it to you at the lower dose. The lowest it comes is 100.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So we'll do 100 for a week. If that's okay, you move up to 200 for a week. If that's okay, you move up to 300 a week. The usual dose is 300.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But you may wind up on just 100. Yknow, it depends on how you.
<b>PT:</b> And this won't affect that thing from my jaw? I don't remember anything. It's another thing I remember.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you mean the Trileptal or Tegretol? No.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause I think I'll be taking that for a long time.
<b>DR:</b> Getting better?
<b>PT:</b> No. The pain is worse. I don't think it, she said it may never get better.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Because of the damage to the nerve. I haven't been having things go too well for me. I was going to get Botox but I figured I better not or I'll end up with droopy eye or something the way my luck is running.
<b>DR:</b> You've got some bad luck.
<b>PT:</b> It's been a bad year.
<b>DR:</b> You've had a bad run. No, not just 1 year. Couple of, a year and a half.
<b>PT:</b> It's been pretty lousy. My daughter had Lyme disease. I mean, it's just.
<b>DR:</b> Well, when I met you in June of '06 you're already 3 years of horrific pain, right?
<b>PT:</b> Of my back.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. So.
<b>PT:</b> That was after the surgery.
<b>DR:</b> A bad 4 year, 4and a half year.
<b>PT:</b> This has been the worst year.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Believe it or not. I had two kids on intravenous at the same time.
<b>DR:</b> At least you're off the Vicodin.
<b>PT:</b> I really never got hooked on that.
<b>DR:</b> The Lexapro was on someone else. It says here Lexapro gave you anxiety. So that was before me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I didn't give you Lexapro. All right, so listen.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, you know who gave me Lexapro, my regular doctor.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> It was my internist who gave me Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b> And it was too much.
<b>PT:</b> That's when I ran here very quickly.
<b>DR:</b> If, um, if the Wellbutrin throws too much juice at your system, use Klonopin to contain it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. 'Til I get used to it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, like I basically saved my mother's life and I should be exalted about it 'cause they thought she was gonna die, I thought she was gonna end up in a home. I straightened it out. And I should feel terrific about it, and I feel like nothing.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause you're depressed.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, is that it?
<b>DR:</b> All right. So number one is Wellbutrin. Now, Wellbutrin's in the morning, 100 SR, every morning.
<b>PT:</b> Will I take the Klonopin and the BuSpar?
<b>DR:</b> Times 1 week, 200 times 1 week, and 300, all in the morning. Two is BuSpar, you're on 30 and 30, right?
<b>PT:</b> BuSpar?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. Three, you're on Klonopin. Now Klonopin should be a 12-hour drug. So if you're finding that you need, um, mid day dose, you might want to just bulk up your morning dose.
<b>PT:</b> Take 3.
<b>DR:</b> Your disability [INAUDIBLE] here. [Physician takes phone call regarding patient.] [DEIDENTIFIED]. Good afternoon. I'm actually with the patient right now. And I like doing it that way just so she's aware of everything we discuss. Um, so just let me know, what are the, courtesy, yknow, for her courtesy also, um, what's the context of this discussion? Okay. Okay. Is it okay for me to put you on speaker? Okay? Can you hear me? Okay. Could you say that again?
<b>DR:</b> Okay, fine. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, 6 weeks, every 6 weeks, 4 and 6 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, let me ask her. 
<b>PT:</b> Three times a week with a psychologist.
<b>DR:</b> Three times a week with a psychologist.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> So she can, I guess sign a release and, yknow, you guys can contact him.
<b>DR:</b> How should she, um, handle that?
<b>PT:</b> The claims examiner knows.
<b>DR:</b> She says the claims examiner knows this.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Well, as you know, prognosis is so difficult. Yknow, sometimes people just get better and other times they just don't get better. It's so hard. I know that insurance companies always want to know this question. I just can't [INAUDIBLE] she certainly wouldn't be better for 6 months. 
<b>DR:</b> But past that I couldn't say.
<b>DR:</b> And, um, what was the other part of the question?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, I think it's extremely limited. She really is paralyzed most days. Most of the day most days with severe anxiety. Um, and I'm, yknow, she has some suicidality. She has, uh, hopelessness, very low mood. And anxiety that we just can't get under control despite, yknow, pretty aggressive treatment with Klonopin, with Benzos. I often don't use these kind of doses, but she really needs it, otherwise she can't function at all. 
<b>DR:</b> She's on, currently she's on, uh, about, almost three mg of Klonopin a day along with 60 mg of BuSpar, both, yknow, decent antianxiety treatments.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, she's still walking and talking and even driving.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm not.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you're not driving?
<b>PT:</b> No, I can't drive.
<b>DR:</b> They won't let her drive with good reason.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm also getting shots in my back.
<b>DR:</b> She gets shots in her back for pain also.
<b>DR:</b> So she's on those 2 antianxiety treatments. She's on Lamictal for stabilizing the mood, and now, this session now, um, we're adding an antidepressant also because she just, we just can't seem to get the mood symptoms under control. So we're beginning Wellbutrin.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. She's been on it before and she couldn't tolerate it. But because there were problems with her and every other antidepressant and she's been on virtually everything else, so we're going to start as low as we can at 100 and inch our way up slowly to 300.
<b>DR:</b> And also I think it's a bad message to the patient to say you think they're going to be sick forever. I mean, otherwise we wouldn't have her here, right. My hope in every patient is that everyone gets better. And we're going to do everything possible to get her through this. And, yknow, I really think eventually we'll get better, but I couldn't promise it to you or her, so I won't say that. But we'll find something. Yknow, I won't stop until we get her better.
<b>DR:</b> Right. Six, 6 months seems a bit, about the next time we should reevaluate this I think.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> You're welcome, bye bye. That was easy.
<b>PT:</b> I don't drive. Nobody lets me drive.
<b>DR:</b> I'm glad you were here 'cause now you know exactly what was said about you.
<b>PT:</b> I appreciate that.
<b>DR:</b> I hate talking about someone without them there. It's just not, yknow. And by the way, everything we say to insurance is in the public record.
<b>PT:</b> Right. I know that.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, so, uh, all right, so we're going to now push Wellbutrin. We're going to maintain the BuSpar where it is. You're going to use Klonopin as needed to the extent that you can walk and talk.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> On those doses. But, yknow, Klonopin as needed.
<b>PT:</b> And the Lamictal.
<b>DR:</b> And continue the Lamictal. And we're going to maintain the Lamictal at 100. Give me a call in a few weeks, good or bad, just let me know how you're doing.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay? 
<b>PT:</b> And then after that I'll make an appointment or you want me to make it now?
<b>DR:</b> Uh, probably 2 months.
<b>PT:</b> Two months?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Let me write, what am I writing?
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Wellbutrin. 'Cause Klonopin is, I have no memory of Klonopin. Whatever I'm taking, I have no memory, whether it's Klonopin. My memory's terrible.
<b>DR:</b> It is the Klonopin. It could be the Lamictal a little bit too.
<b>PT:</b> It's like, um, Groundhog Day, every day is a new day for me.
