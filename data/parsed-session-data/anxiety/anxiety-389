<font size="4"><b>26: Resilience in the Palestinian Occupied Territories</b></font>

Afocus on resilience is an extremely
useful way of looking at the mental
health of children and adults in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT: includes
the West Bank, Gaza, and East-Jerusalem). On
the one hand, Palestinians are dealing with a
broad range of adversities and psychological
Stressors that, especially during the latest intifada
(Palestinian uprising), have tested them and
their health to the limit; on the other hand, they
possess individual, social, and national assets
that help the majority continue to live on despite
the many problems they face. In this chapter,
we detail both the adversities Palestinians face
and the consequences of those adversities to their
mental health. We also examine evidence of the
resilience of Palestinian youth in the OPT. In
particular, we consider how a development organization,
the Palestinian Youth Association for
Leadership and Rights Activation (PYALARA),
a Palestinian youth nongovernmental organization
(NGO) in the West Bank, creates conditions
that bolster resilience among Palestinian youth.
This discussion will show that resilience is
as dependent on how, structurally, organizations
respond to the needs of youth, providing
them opportunities for meaningful participation
in their communities, as it is the individual
qualities each youth has when confronting
adversity.

<b>The Challenges Faced</b>

Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East-Jerusalem
presently find themselves in a crisis
of dramatic proportions. Strict border closures
and a system of Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks,
initiated during the first half of the
1990s, have reached an unprecedented level
during the second intifada (from September
2000 to the present). Travel has become full of
obstacles and hazards--not only traveling from
the OPT into Israel but also between Palestinian
cities or districts inside the West Bank and
Gaza. As a result, there has been a steep decline

[p. <i>418</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00456&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The majority of Palestinians in the OPT--
over 3 million--are young, below 24 years of
age, and confronted with little hope that their
situation will get better in the near future. There
has been a tendency among youth and adults to
focus on the deficits they routinely experience.
They can barely meet others outside their community,
so important for adolescents who want
to enjoy a normal social life, engage in social
experimentation and adventuring, or test their
competencies. Youth also know that they will
face difficulty in finding appropriate vocational
or academic study opportunities after high
school. Furthermore, given the stagnation in the
search for political solutions to the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, we observe present-day Palestinian
youth to be generally pessimistic about the
duration of the occupation or whether a viable
Palestinian state will ever emerge. The recent
Israeli policy of building the separation wall/
fence, the political-military measure that attracted
a great deal of international attention in 2003
and 2004, is generally perceived as an instrument
of annexation, making the establishment
of a viable Palestinian state impossible. Many
Palestinians, including the youth, talk daily of
their struggle to confront a policy of national
fragmentation and "silent transfer" (the emigration
of Palestinians from the OPT to countries
abroad as a way to cope with the economic and
social obstacles they face in the OPT). Youth
perceive that, gradually, Israel is trying to test
the resolve of Palestinians to induce them to
give up on their project of nation building.


Although youth experience their individual
opportunities to be very limited and the political
track to be blocked, they also face a great
many, often recurrent, crises in daily life. From
September 28, 2000, to July 20, 2004, 3,209
Palestinians were killed as a result of the violence,
an average of over 2.3 per day. From that total,
an estimated 23.5% were children (age 18 and
under) (<i>Palestine Monitor</i>, 2004). The number
of unarmed people killed so far in the West Bank
and Gaza during the second intifada is over
2,000.


Thousands of Palestinian youth have become
emotionally handicapped as a result of clashes
with the army. In a study conducted among
10- to 19-year-olds in the OPT in 2003, the Gaza
Community Mental Health Program discovered
that 94.6% had experienced a funeral, 83.2% had
witnessed shooting incidents, 62% had seen a
relative being hurt or killed, and 36% had been
teargassed (quoted in Shahade, 2004). A psychosocial
assessment of Palestinian children in
August 2002 by Arafat and Boothby (2003)
showed 93% "not feeling safe and exposed to
attack" (p. 5), and almost half of the children
"personally experienced violence owing to the
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict or ...
witnessed an incident of such violence befalling
on an immediate family member" (p. 5). "One
out of five children (21%) ... had to move out of
their homes, temporarily or permanently, overwhelmingly
for conflict related reasons" (p. 5).
Witnessing relatives or friends being imprisoned,
especially when they are older and carry
authority, is an additional Stressor on young
people. During the direct occupation of the
Palestinian cities by the Israeli army, from spring
2002 on, tens of thousands of arrests have been
made, and Palestinian youth have been imprisoned
or seen their fathers or brothers being
imprisoned.


Such violent happenings cause fear and anxiety
in children. During intifada clashes, a great
many children and youth were forced to lay on
the ground for several hours in their homes or to
hide in kitchens and stairwells to avoid stray bullets.
Even then, many witnessed bullets coming
into the homes, family members escaping death,
or soldiers entering and sometimes occupying
their homes for the purpose of using them as
lookout posts. Some young people have witnessed
the demolition of their houses after they
were considered illegally built or in retaliation
for a family member being involved in violent
action against the Israelis or for the purposes of
Israeli construction projects (e.g., the building of
settlement roads or the separation wall/fence).

[p. <i>419</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00457&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Less dramatically, but also significantly
affecting people's mood, are the humiliations
people routinely witness or experience at checkpoints.
People aimlessly waiting at checkpoints
for many hours has become commonplace. Each
community has countless stories about soldiers
mocking them or asking people to perform
irrelevant and humiliating tasks in order to pass.
Related to these barriers to free movement, a
Stressor that usually goes unobserved but that
has a pervasive influence on Palestinians is the
continuous uncertainty experienced organizing
daily life. Whole communities often do not
know in the early morning what the day will
bring, whether the children and youth can go
to school, which route to take to work, or
whether there will be work tomorrow. During
the months of December 2002 to February 2003,
it appeared to be a purposeful policy of the military
to keep the inhabitants of Palestinian cities
such as Bethlehem uncertain about whether a
curfew would be installed that day or lifted, with
word coming only the morning on which the
curfew was to take effect. This uncertainty led to
stressful situations inside families who did not
know whether to work or send their children to
school. "You cannot plan for tomorrow," has
become a common complaint heard in the OPT.


These obstacles should be viewed in a more
general context of personal and collective vulnerability.
Due to the violence, there is a basic lack
of safety in public life, and many parents do not
allow their children to leave home in the evening.
The lack of safety is also keenly felt at the economic
level. The OPT do not have an institutional
safety net associated with welfare states, such
as unemployment or retirement allowances. What
many experience in such a risky situation is an
accumulation of adversities in daily life, such as
when a child has a handicap, a father is unemployed,
and family members cannot reach the
places they need to go, including medical and
educational facilities, because of hazards and
restrictions when traveling. Characteristic of
Palestinian life in the OPT is an accumulation
of interlocking obstacles that make nearly all
aspects of daily life an uphill struggle, a continuing
experience of exponential risks resulting from
multiple stressors (Small &amp; Memmo, 2004).


Although everybody is at risk, there are those
whose exposure to multiple risks is particularly
acute, including those in lower socioeconomic
strata, the refugee camps, on the peripheries
of the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip as a whole
(with its large refugee camps), near the Israeli
settlements (where clashes with settlers may be
frequent), and near the separation wall/fence.
Groups at special risk include the disabled, who
are often already secluded from public life but
are now further affected by financial constraints
and travel obstacles. Girls and young women
are also affected disproportionately; they cannot
easily leave home alone because of unsafe
streets and traditional conventions against
their travel in the late afternoon and evening.
Arguably, political and military circumstances
affect them more than they affect boys and
young men.

<b>Mental Health Issues</b>

How does this situation of interlocking adversities
affect the mental health and behavior of
young people in the OPT? First, it has been
documented by mental health organizations
and psychologists that the emotional behavior of
individual youth display many direct symptoms
of trauma and anxiety, such as nightmares
and bed-wetting, increased aggressiveness and
hyperactivity, and a decrease in attention span
and capacity to concentrate (Arafat &amp; Boothby,
2003). World Vision, a leading foreign aid organization
working in the OPT, speaks in a recent
report about the psychosocial syndromes and
trauma that Palestinian children face (Albina,
2002). That report includes results from an
unpublished study by Tamar Lavi from Tel Aviv
University that showed a 70% prevalence rate
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among
Palestinian children from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, compared with a 20% to 60% prevalence
of such syndromes in international studies
on children in war zones (Albina, 2002). It has
been suggested by Palestinian spokesperson
Hanan Ashrawi that the term <i>PTSD</i> is not appropriate
in the case of the OPT, because Palestimans
do not face just <i>post</i>traumatic stress disorders
but rather <i>ongoing</i> trauma disorders (personal
communication, March 2004).


PYALARA's own experiences as a youth
development NGO in the OPT point to how the

[p. <i>420</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00458&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Against this background of powerlessness
and frustration, one problematic health response
is the withdrawal by many youth from active
participation in their families and communities.
Many youth are inactive, staying at home,
watching television (several music video satellite
stations have become available in the Arab
world, attracting huge youth audiences). Youth
lack both a role and a voice. The result is a kind
of generalized frustration turning inward--not
an explosion but an <i>im</i>plosion. Their withdrawal
is sometimes a reaction to the gravity of
events. After prolonged periods of curfew in the
Palestinian cities, it was not uncommon to
observe people being confused, not concentrating
and rather forgetful, overcome by an overall
loss of orientation as they ventured to reconstruct
regular routines.


Another specific response to the political
situation is a compensatory identification with
suicide bombers, as documented by the Gaza
Community Mental Health Program (quoted in
Shahade, 2004). This identification results from
the absence of powerful and inspiring persons
in youths' social environments. Because Arab
society and culture place special importance on
a strong father figure, children and youth are
deeply affected by the diminished authority of
fathers who have become unemployed, humiliated
at checkpoints by young Israeli soldiers, or
put in custody. At the national level, until his
recent death, Yasser Arafat, considered by many
to be the father of the Palestinian national movement
for five decades, was imprisoned in his
headquarters in Ramallah, making him a leader
without the physical opportunity to lead. The
Palestinian police, part of the Palestinian
Authority, have become a symbol of powerlessness
as well, because they are usually perceived
to comply with Israeli army commands. In this
void of leadership, the suicide bomber takes
on the role of a substitute, seemingly powerful
figure, expressing in a single, spectacular and
deadly act the frustration and rage of those
victimized. A small but significant number of
parents (5%-8%) reported that "their children
have become fixated on thoughts of death and
revenge" (Arafat &amp; Boothby, 2003, p. 6).


Withdrawal, anger, and feelings of revenge
go hand in hand with a pervasive despair about
both the larger political context and the hassles of
daily life. Feelings of hopelessness have deepened.
In the streets, it is common to hear expressions
such as, "For Palestinians yesterday is
always better than today." Informally, many youth
are ambiguous about the official Palestinian
"story" of a progressive struggle leading to independence.
Even though people in general subscribe
to the legitimacy of Palestinian national
rights and regard Palestinian spokespersons as
expressing their collective rights in the conflict
with Israel, it is also often said that the struggle
goes from one "debacle" to another. Such pronouncements
speak to people's sense of being
abandoned by their leaders and misguided by
social institutions.


Overall, the mental health situation of youth
and adults is characterized by a pervasive sense
of the obstacles faced rather than a focus on
opportunities. It is difficult to challenge this
view when it appears grounded in a reality that
indeed effectively blocks development personally
and economically. "Nothing is easy here,"
people say. Many identify with the painting
of the Palestinian artist Suleiman Mansour that
depicts the Palestinian people's identity as an
old man carrying the globe on his back. Daily
talk is full of images of being ''closed up" or

[p. <i>421</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00459&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The constant awareness of one's confinement
and a sense of waiting without knowing the
future generate feelings of boredom among
youth, especially outside school hours and on
holidays. Diaries written by older students in
the OPT (see the compilation by Atallah &amp; van
Teeffelen, 2004) display a remarkable swing
between, on the one hand, a basic nervousness,
sense of vulnerability, and uncertainty because
of the hazards of daily life, and on the other,
routine boredom of living in an environment
that lacks the presence of spatial and temporal
"horizons."

<b>Sources of Resilience</b>

Given this gloomy picture, Palestinians continue
to possess a range of significant resources, a
resilience that presents a balance to the threats to
their mental health and a way out of their desperate
situation. After all, the academic and developmental
interest in concepts such as resilience has
precisely sprung from a need to correct the pervasive
image of helpless and traumatized victims
that puts responsibility for change on psychosocial
professionals or policymakers, with few
expectations of the affected persons themselves
(Newman, 2004). To their own misfortune,
Palestinians have long been confronting, in the
media and politics, the bipolar stereotypes of victimized
refugees and victimizing terrorists (van
Teeffelen, 2004). Under the gaze of an international
audience, their resilience is overlooked.
Resources for resilience among Palestinians do
exist, however, and include social opportunities,
supportive networks, and spiritual, cultural, or
value-ased strengths.


Of these, their national and cultural identity
is the most ubiquitous resource they possess.
Palestinians have as cultural traits stubbornness
and the enduring capacity to cope, a capacity
perhaps founded on the traditional mentality of
the peasant (the majority of Palestinians before
the 1948 war were peasants) who are strongly
attached to their lands. Rooted in a centuries-old
history of collective resilience (and resistance)
forged during confrontations with rulers and
landlords and of fighting subjugation by successive
military and political rulers, talk of despair
is neutralized by a spoken, or unspoken, collective
will not to have their spirits broken.
Palestinians will say, "While we suffer more,
the Israelis suffer too, and this will in the end
break their spirit rather than ours."


This spirit, however, is not one-dimensional,
limited to one or two expressions of emotion
(anger and despair, for instance) but rather can
manifest in a range of interpretative and emotional
repertoires helpful for coping with the
uncertainties of life as it is. Combined with this is
a willingness to accept suffering while celebrating
at the level of the human spirit, warmth and
a certain "lightness" characteristic of Mediterranean
culture. Visitors to Palestine may be
struck by the ability of Palestinians to laugh and
enjoy the quiet rhythm of life interrupted by
impatient but friendly bursts of social interaction.


Much of Palestinian cultural resilience is a
way of coping with suffering, a survival strategy
that allows them to "hang on." In local discourse,
this daily strategy for living is sometimes
called <i>sumud</i> or steadfastness, a concept
close to but not exactly the same as resilience.
Stretched over a period of three decades, the
Palestinian lawyer Raja Shehadeh (1982, 1992,
2003) has written a series of diaries in which
he gave personal meaning to <i>sumud</i>, or what
he initially called "the third way"--neither allowing
oneself to be subjugated by the occupation
(through withdrawal or inactivation) nor making
a choice for armed struggle. The third way was
to stay put, not to leave the country or to become
resigned to the occupation but to remain
attached to living a normal life.


As a concept, <i>sumud</i> has not been unproblematic.
It initially was employed as a top-down
concept by Arab and Palestinian leaders to
express politically a desired steadlastness during
the national struggle. But slaying put became a
sometimes impossibly rigid demand, not linked
to the demands of daily life, when for instance
youth were advised to stay in she country while

[p. <i>422</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00460&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A factor relevant to the cultural <i>sumud</i> of
Palestinians is the importance of religion as a
source of faith, spiritual commitment, guidance,
and consolation. Observers during the intifada
have often equated the increase in Islamic religious
observance with an increase in political
radicalism and despair, resulting in support
for militant paramilitary groups like Hamas and
Islamic Jihad. Yet such observations, although
satisfying media stereotypes of Islam, give
reductive meaning to a complex phenomenon.
During uncertain and seemingly hopeless times,
many persons and families consider faith as a
beacon for spiritual orientation in a world lacking
leadership and values. For instance, in the
diaries of Palestinian youth (Atallah &amp; Van
Teeffelen, 2003), several Christian and Moslem
girls at a private school in Bethlehem mentioned
as their main inner source of strength the
inspiring example of religious personalities,
Palestinian and non-Palestinian, who devoted
themselves to the improvement of the world.
In this sense, religion may well contribute to an
inner, spiritual resilience. At the same time, it
is also true that religion can contribute to a crippled
form of resilience when it incorporates
youth into hierarchical relations that block initiative
and independence and when religion
feeds fanaticism. To what extent religion contributes
to mental health is therefore a complex
and contradictory subject that certainly, in the
Palestinian context, awaits study and research.


Resilience is further supported by educational
opportunities. In the study by Arafat and
Boothby (2003), education was felt to be the
single most important resource for healthy
development. Despite the odds of gaining access
to education, when it is available at all, 96% of
Palestinian children saw education as their main
means to improve their situation. Commitment
to education is very strong among Palestinian
families for historical reasons. After losing
much of their land in 1948, Palestinian families
inculcated values of education into their
children because education was perceived as
a way of opening horizons for alternative routes
in life. It helped to develop their resilience, a
resilience understood not only as psychic
strength and the capacity to endure adversities
over a prolonged period of time ("steeling"
one's self to adversity, as it is appropriately
described in the resilience literature; Small
&amp; Memmo, 2004) but also in terms of tactical
inventiveness, problem-solving capacities, and
survival techniques that enable one to meet the
requirements of an adventurous journey through
life. Understood this way, the resilient person
should not only be steadfast but also make
detours before coming on course again to find
solutions that ensure survival (Cyrulnik, 2002).


When referring to flexible problem-solving
skills and tactical resilience, we should not only
think about the influence of formal organizations
for youth such as the educational system
but also of informal daily survival techniques
such as supportive sociality, which includes
sharing the many tricks needed to cross check-points,
the informal and impromptu release of
thoughts and feelings between family members
at the morning break, and the pervasive dark
humor that helps anybody, including youth, rise
above their situation and look at it in a lighter
way. In our experience, mutually supportive
discussion about the small moments of daily life
is a major factor in explaining Palestinian
resilience, combining and valorizing the influence
of cultural values and social networks.


Crucial supportive networks for social
resilience are the extended family and the community.
The family is considered a moral pillar
in Palestinian society and takes a central place
in Palestinian popular culture. Traditionally, and
now most especially in the refugee camps, the
Palestinian families' ability to endure, successfully
recover from wars, and reorganize the

[p. <i>423</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00461&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Guided by these principles, a great many
Palestinian NGOs have contributed over the
years to enhancing the resilience of youth.
Although the history of Palestinian NGOs in
relation to the Palestinian National Authority
is beyond the scope of this chapter, it should be
noted that prior to the signing of the Oslo agreement,
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29190');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29190" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. Signed on May 4, 1994, outlining the first
stage of Palestinian autonomy--in Gaza and
Jericho--including Israeli redeployment and the
establishment of a Palestinian self-governmental
authority. Israel remained in control of the settlements,
military locations, and security matters. The
stipulated interim period ended on May 4, 1999.</div>
the role of NGOs in the OPT was more
focused on relief and aid for crisis-affected
Palestinian citizens, in addition to acting as
referral organizations substituting for the lack
of a ruling government. After a new future
was envisioned with the semiresolution of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict (proven a failure
after almost 7 years), the role of the nongovernmental
organizations started to evolve as an
important component in the development of
Palestinian society into a proto-state. The collapse
of the peace process and the reescalation
of violence and conflict during the second
intifada have meant that NGOs have had to
change their course once again, providing
opportunities for dealing with the emergency
situation resulting from the violence. With
regard to youths' role in these NGOs, they organized
and facilitated leisure activities, training
and workshops, nonviolent actions, and community
work. Specific activities have included the
following:


<i>Activation and Awareness Raising</i>


• Summer camps


• Discussion meetings


• Club activities


• Local journeys


• International journeys


<i>Skills Related</i>


• Skill-enhancing courses and workshops for
youth (arts, computer, etc.)


<i>Expressive, "Voice" Activities</i>


• Diary writing


• International computer exchanges


• Counseling workshops


• Youth media


• Theater and film


• Participation in international meetings


<i>Community Actions</i>


• Voluntary community work (e.g., rebuilding
demolished houses or supporting patients)


• Advocacy campaigns for issues such as
people's right and access to education


• Support to victims of violence


• Nonviolent direct or indirect actions in piotest
against the occupation or the separation wall/
fence


A major task of youth development NGOs
in Palestine has been to look for ways to bring

<b>The Story of Pyalara</b>

PYALARA was established in 1999, initially
with the aim to serve a Palestinian youth audience
as a youth media and communications-oriented
NGO. It was an initiative by a group of
young journalists who were determined to give
Palestinian youth a voice through the establishment
of a youth paper. This paper became <i>The
Youth Times</i>, a 24-page monthly bilingual newspaper
produced by and for youth. Before the
establishment of <i>The Youth Times</i>, only a few
young people could publish their writing in the
daily newspapers in the OPT. During several
brainstorming sessions with young people from
different Palestinian locations, it became clear
to the founders of <i>The Youth Times</i> that young
people needed to have a louder voice in their
community. Hindering this expression was a
Palestinian media that lacked cultural identity,
professionalism, and a comprehensive vision
about its role as a tool for change. Moreover, the
print media were politically one-sided, boring,
semiofficial, and did not meet the social, political,
educational, and entertainment needs of
their readers. In this context, <i>The Youth Times</i>
was a fruit hard to harvest. People were not
accustomed to a youth paper by and for youth.
At the time, the Palestinian media did not feature
any youth papers, pages, or magazines, and
those that were available in the shops--youth
magazines from the Arab world--were all made
by adults and usually directed themselves
toward young people in a patronizing manner.


Circumstances have obliged <i>The Youth Times</i>
to adopt a much broader view of the needs of
Palestinian youth. A few months after PYALARA's
establishment as a registered NGO in October
2000 with the intent to produce both print and
television reports about issues of concern to
young people in the OPT, the second intifada
erupted. A sense of paralysis, uncertainty, fear,
and helplessness prevailed throughout the territories.
The energized, active, and enthusiast
youth associated with PYALARA suddenly felt
powerless and lost their sense of direction. In
response, a youth conference organized by
PYALARA, Palestinian Youth Vision, and the
YWCA took place in Jerusalem in November
2000 with more than 200 young Palestinians
in attendance. The conference was titled "The
Role of Young People in Times of Conflict."
Youth participants mapped out their role for the
stressing times ahead. The ideas and recommendations
agreed on constituted the action plan on
which PYALARA started to strategize its role
during the second intifada.


In the presence of Bertrand Bainvel, UNICEF's
program officer, PYALARA's members shared
their deep feelings of anxiety, frustration, and
despair. "I am really scared," said Lana, a 14-year-old
from Jerusalem. "When I was going to
PYALARA's office, the Israeli soldiers body-searched
me, my school bag.... They humiliated
me to the extent that I wished I had
anything with me to defend myself." She started
crying and continued: "I was ready to do a real
crazy thing at that moment." Nisreen, a 15-year-old,
gently interrupted: "What would you gain if
you do something stupid?... You should control
yourself and think of better ways to express
your anger."


The level of frustration and helplessness
expressed at the meeting was great. The young
people participating repeatedly said that they
felt terrible about being unable to do anything
about the escalation of violence and the worsening
political situation. We had witnessed this
frustration daily before the meetings. Those
who could make it through checkpoints, invasions,
and curfews were coming to our offices to
talk, some of them expressing their frustration
through writings, whereas others could not
speak or write at all, so fearful had they become.


Those youth who made it to PYALARA-
supported meetings came together to find a way
out of their situation by helping others far more
affected by the invasions and curfews than they
were to express themselves. Saleem Habash,

At the start of the Intifada when Mohammed
al-Dura was killed [a small Gaza boy killed while
in the arms of his father, an event accidentally
filmed and repeatedly shown on all Palestinian
and Arab TV stations], we realized that most
young people were unable to express themselves
and that this would lead to an explosion. I wanted
to spread the word that youth could do something.


Young people and PYALARA subsequently
advocated and lobbied with the Jerusalem office
of UNICEF to support a new initiative. UNICEF
gave the green light for launching a project that
aimed to alleviate the pressure that Palestinian
adolescents experience. A cadre of Palestinian
university students (specializing in sociology,
psychology, and social work) were trained to
become mentors and psychosocial supports for
their peers. The training included psychosocial
intervention methods, conflict resolution techniques,
communication, and leadership skills.


After training, the mentors of the We Care
project headed to the field to meet with school
pupils in a selected number of underprivileged
areas in the West Bank and Gaza. In pairs, they
conducted a series of workshops aimed at alleviating
the pressures of the crisis affecting their
peers. Through a series of 8 to 10 youth-to-youth
sessions, youth mentors helped adolescents
by listening to their problems, giving them
advice, providing them with information, and
making them aware that there were people who
cared about them. In the beginning, the young
people and mentors had to deal with the psychological
barriers between them and create
trust and a sense of mutual solidarity. The fact
that the mentors were only a few years older
than the pupils greatly facilitated interaction.


After the ice was broken between the mentors
and school pupils, the mentors encouraged
the pupils to relieve their inner feelings about
the problems they were suffering. The issues
that the young people related to the mentors at
first had most to do with the political situation--
about how the violence affected them; how
some of them faced nightmares, nervousness,
sadness, or anger over the loss of a relative or a
friend; concerns about their inability to socialize
due to the inability to travel; and general feelings
of fear, insecurity, despair, and revenge.


After young people expressed their problems
and feelings, they discussed with the mentors
ways to cope with these problems. Several
youth talked about how they reacted violently
to their feelings. Wael, a 13-year-old from the
Qalandia refugee camp near Ramallah, felt
relieved only when he could throw stones at the
jeep of soldiers patrolling the streets adjacent to
the camp. When asked why he threw stones at
a fully protected jeep, Wael said, "Those Israelis
have to know that we will not allow them to
steal more Palestinian land." In another of the
We Care sessions, a 16-year-old girl from the
Nablus area said that she envied the boys who
could throw stones at Israeli jeeps and soldiers.
"I wish to have the courage to go to the streets
and also throw stones at the occupiers." Despite
the fact that less than 1% of Palestinian youth
resort to stone throwing, face-to-face interviews
conducted at the time by PYALARA revealed
that those youngsters who expressed their anger
and frustration against the occupation by throwing
stones, by demonstrating, burning tires, or
writing slogans in the streets were in fact less
prone to think of suicidal acts or bombings.


Interviews also showed that the more silent and
less expressive the youth were, the more inclined
they were to carrying out suicide bombings.
Interestingly, after a number of sessions with
We Care mentors, many of the young people
showed indifference to the political problems
they were facing, at least as they had first perceived
and understood them. Once given a platform
on which to express themselves, they chose
instead to focus on normal teen problems, such as
difficulties with relationships between boys and
girls; sexual problems; social problems (such
as domestic violence and violence in school,
early marriage, and the use of drugs); problems
related to their local communities including
social, interpolitical, and family problems, or study-and
work-related problems, all compheated by
the political realities of their lives but nevertheless
common to teenagers globally.


Mentors were asked not to give any prescriptions
for action. Many of the students described

[p. <i>426</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00464&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In summary, the We Care project addressed a
need to make available a refuge for youth where
they could find people who listened to them,
gave them appropriate advice, and assisted them
to realize their potential. But beyond helping
individual kids, the project also had a broader
social dimension. It followed the long-valued
tradition of volunteer work among Palestinians,
encouraged hand-in-hand cooperation between
universities and schools, between NGOs and
ministries, between older and younger youth,
and between those empowered and those less
advantaged adolescents.


Despite these many positive outcomes, the
approach was criticized nonetheless. The bulk
of the critique was focused on a single issue that
reflected the widespread acceptance of traditional
mental health models of caring, which
relied on experts. How could young people talk
with their peers effectively about their problems,
especially during such a severe situation,
without any real professional help? The youths'
enthusiastic endorsement of the project was
an effective answer to its critics. The dogmatic
assertions by the experts only hardened the determination
of PYALARA staff and the youth they
served to continue their work.


Even though the level of interaction between
the mentors and adolescents was high, some of
the youth demanded more sessions as well as
a private environment more conducive to talk
about personal problems. In 2002, a youth-to-youth
hotline was established after an intensive
training of the mentors. Many calls were
received from young people seriously affected
by the intifada. The callers felt that it was easier
for them to speak to an "invisible friend" whom
they could tell anything without being shy. As a
tool to listen to youth, the hotline does not provide
prescriptions for how callers can solve their
problems. Instead, operators are taught to help
youth express their anger in healthy ways. In
case of serious problems, callers are referred to
more professional helpers.


Through both these initiatives, it has become
apparent that the frustrations felt in general by
young Palestinians are multiplied in the case of
those who also cope with physical disability in
a society where few specialized resources are
available. Eighteen-year-old Hamdan has never
been able to walk without support. His early child-hood
was a profoundly unhappy time because his
family lacked understanding of his particular
needs. According to him, "I was always alone,
always crying; I didn't feel human." A chance
encounter in 2000 led to an invitation from
PYALARA for Hamdan to attend a journalism
course in Jordan, which Hamdan felt "was the
first time people treated me with respect." Since
then, he has been an active participant in all activities
at PYALARA's office north of Jerusalem,
traveling from his home in Bethlehem along
a route made tortuous by the Israeli Army road-blocks.
In early 2002, Hamdan negotiated with
PYALARA to take responsibility for the production
of a four-page special feature in <i>The Youth
Times</i> focusing on disability issues. He explained
his motivation for this as follows: "I don't want
others to live a hard life like me. I have a message
in my life, which I must offer. Even if I die, I must
paint a smile on handicapped people's faces,"
With the confidence and skills acquired through
activities with PYALARA, Hamdan has taken a

[p. <i>427</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00465&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>A Televised Voice</b>


Participants in the We Care groups moved
from reflection to action as they became more
involved with PYALARA and each other.
Groups were provided with an opportunity to
share their ideas in <i>The Youth Times</i> and to make
use of PYALARA's weekly television program
<i>Alli Sotak</i> [Speak Up] to voice their issues and
concerns. It has to be emphasized that there
continues to be very little attention paid in the
Palestinian media, schools, and among caregivers
to the health and lifestyle questions
Palestinian youth face. PYALARA's work has
brought a new level of awareness to the experience
of Palestinian youth. Until this work
began, it was uncommon to find the perspectives
of teenagers represented during political discussions
conducted in the media or in public places,
even though youth have been the main street
actors in the intifada and are the main victims of
restrictions on mobility prevalent in the OPT.


Established in 1999, PYALARA was selected
by UNICEF to help celebrate, for the first time in
Palestine, the International Broadcasting Day for
Children. A series of television episodes were
produced by young Palestinians that became
the base for regular television programming by
2002. Young people now not only present but
also produce the televised episodes. <i>Alli Sotak</i>
has become a weekly 2-hour program broadcast
by Palestine TV that tackles both light and
serious issues of concern for youth. According
to estimates based on polls conducted by the
Palestine Bureau of Statistics, over the period of
its 5-year existence <i>Alli Sotak</i> has been regularly
viewed by as many as 300,000 people. The
relatively high number of viewers, combined
with the 90,000 to 100,000 readers of <i>The Youth
Times</i> demonstrates how collectively oriented
Palestinian society is. Episodes are watched and
the newspapers read in a communal setting with
multiple family members and visitors present or
among peers at school or university.


The television programming by PYALARA
is owned by the youth themselves, as is their
newspaper. Through both mediums, although
most especially the television, PYALARA
participants are able to reach almost every
household in the West Bank and Gaza. Even
more important, they are also able to address
the concerns of youth who because of a handicap
or because of family restrictions and social
conventions are unable to leave their homes.


Participants in PYALARA's production work
routinely comment on the impact their participation
has had on their lives. Ahmed, a 17-year-old
from Jerusalem, considers PYALARA's
media as a door to his future, allowing him
to express his worries and those of his peers.
Eighteen-year-old Lana said that her experience
producing a television program helped her
to deal better with the bitter outcomes of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, making her experiences
of value to others: "Through <i>Alli Sotak</i>, I
can express myself. I can communicate with my
peers from all over Palestine. I can share their
pains and touch their souls." This same impact is
felt by media consumers. In research by Birzeit
University's Department of Mass Communication
(2004), 77.3% of young people who read
<i>The Youth Times</i> said that they thought that
it both activated and empowered Palestinian
youth. Almost 80% believed that it raised their
awareness of their rights and responsibilities,
and 30% felt that the newspaper changed their
views and attitudes toward a variety of issues.


The results reflect PYALARA's commitment
to focus on issues relevant to youth, producing
programming and journalistic accounts that can
make even the most modest individuals heroes
and heroines in their underprivileged communities.
For example, when a group of young girls
from Biddo near Ramallah tackled the issue of
early marriage, their whole village watched the
special TV episode they produced. Such initiatives
make adolescents role models for their
peers who watch the shows or read what they
write in <i>The Youth Times</i>.


<b>Saleem Habash, Age 22: My Experience</b>


<i>In 1997 I got to know about a new idea of
a newspaper for young people--all made by
young people. Since I loved writing, and I could
not find a place to publish my writings but my
notebooks and computer, I was excited to get
involved. At that time, during the years after the</i>

[p. <i>428</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00466&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>At that time I was in high school, a 15-year-old
who had lots of energy but nowhere to
express myself or a forum to speak through. I
started getting involved with the preparatory
meetings held in the</i> Jerusalem Times <i>office.
Afterward, I became a correspondent for</i> The
Youth Times. <i>I remember the first time I had an
article published in the newspaper, with my personal
photo beside it, I was returning back from
school, and people were pointing at me saying
that they had seen my picture in the newspaper</i>.


<i>After that, I became very active with The</i>
Youth Times <i>and PYALARA. In 2001, I became
a PYALARA staff and then managing editor for</i>
The Youth Times.


<i>My experience with PYALARA has changed a
lot about who I am without changing my principles
and beliefs. PYALARA has given me the
space and tools to grow, yet without being forced
into a certain shape. Having the tools for change,
you end up in a cycle of creating change: not only
do you create change amongst others, but further,
they exert change within your life as well; it is a
cycle</i>.


<i>Being involved with PYALARA has given me
the strength to become an activist in my society
and an advocate for the rights of children and
young people. There is not just one experience
that makes all the difference, which teaches the
person fully and makes him or her to become
more resilient. Rather, the experiences between
the ups and downs are the ones that really educate
the individual and make of him or her a
new person. I remember, once, I was excited to
cover a musical festival in Ramallah. We contacted
the organizers and convinced them to
give us a press pass to enter and view all the
shows. Apparently, mine was taken away
because I was, then, too young to be at the show.
I became almost furious about this unjust treatment.
It did not stop right there, but I was urged
to write about what happened, and I did. I wrote
about it in the paper from all my heart and soul.
Everyone read it, and I felt that although I
missed being treated like the other journalists, I
was the gatekeeper for the freedom of the press</i>.


<i>Now, everything is different. My role has
developed greatly. I am responsible for urging
other young people to write and express themselves.
The uniqueness of PYALARA stems from
the fact that we do it differently. Everything is
developmental; we develop ourselves to help
develop other young people</i>.


<i>PYALARA has played a major role in my life.
Having worked with PYALARA has urged me to
become a journalist and has unleashed various
sides of my personality that have not been
touched before. Even in the darkest days, I
found my shelter in PYALARA</i>.


<b>Lessons Learned</b>


Our experience with PYALARA has shown
that promoting resilience requires the abandonment
of an overly medical and individualistic
approach to health promotion. We must look
instead for a holistic way to intervene that places
emphasis on the context in which social relationships
take place.


Furthermore, disadvantaged youth need
opportunities to become fully involved participants
in their society. Youth need a voice, a
respected role, and a meaningful cause to sustain
health, especially during bewildering times
such as this intifada. Such involvement helps
them to develop psychological protection, selfesteem,
and confidence. Through the act of tackling
issues collectively, youth develop a sense of
competence and political and self-efficacy.
What PYALARA demonstrates is that participation
by youth should not be a form of tokenism
but should involve youth at the very first steps
in the development of programming. They
should be involved in designing, implementing,
and monitoring the projects in which they are
engaged. In fact, We Care and the youth media
projects have all been youth initiatives in which
adults played only a distant role.


PYALARA's success also teaches us that
successful trauma projects do more than provide
skills training and discussion groups. Any training
PYALARA gives is always linked to action
and field implementation. Any investment put in
training and empowering young persons helps
them to become leaders, providers of services,
and role models for their peers. In this Way.
PYALARA guarantees a sustained engagement

[p. <i>429</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00467&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Resilience is realized through the structures
provided, specifically how support is provided
and accessed and resources and opportunities
for personal and collective development organized.
The development of peer-to-peer relationships
as part of projects promoting resilience
has been shown to be particularly helpful,
especially when older competent youth such
as university students support younger youth
at school. These mentoring relationships can
sometimes provide better support than family
members to youth in crisis (Newman, 2004),
especially in a traditionally hierarchical society
such as that of the Palestinians. We fully
endorse Gilligan's (1999) plea to make use of
nonprofessional mentors who, with only a modest
allowance, can offer quality time, enthusiasm,
and commitment to their younger peers.
Furthermore, when these mentors do not come
from the community where school students live,
they may in fact be trusted with more intimate
information than is the case of those who are
part of the local community. In a sense, these
mentors are both indigenous and external
members of the youths' communities (Gilligan,
1999), combining the advantages of both. This
is even more the case for youth who help to
operate the hotline at PYALARA's offices.


In PYALARA's experience, youth media
constitute a strategic social resource for the
development of resilience, for several reasons.
First, a healthy youth media help youth to
express themselves and to relay in creative
ways the issues they face. Resilience is greatly
enhanced when traumatized youth have the opportunity
to express themselves through genres with
which they are familiar. PYALARA's media
projects give room to various forms of expression,
including music, popular song, text, and
poetry, as well as more standard types of journalistic
reporting. Second, making and watching
media reports about situations or events that
leave traumatic scars (such as long curfews and
being a witness to violence in the streets or at
school) help youth to better understand their
problems. Furthermore, a vibrant youth media
helps to put youth issues into a broader context
so that it becomes possible for youth to look at
and understand those issues with perspective
and depth. Exemplary cases of coping, resilient,
or transformative behavior in response to
adverse or challenging situations, documented
as part of these media expressions, inspire viewers
ers and readers alike. Third, making media
products gives participating youth active roles
that are interesting, challenging, prestigious,
and skill based. These roles include journalist,
cameraman, soundman, interviewer, program
producer, editor, and writer. By fulfilling such
roles, youth demonstrate their interests and abilities
and develop their skills and a sense of competence
and self-esteem. Skill development is
enhanced through exposure to the work of other
media professionals as well. In fact, recently,
local journalists of the satellite station Al-Jazeera,
several of them female, have become
role models for PYALARA participants. These
journalists have reported, not without danger,
about daily events from the West Bank and
Gaza, inspiring PYALARA's youth to do the
same. Enacting media-related roles is a source
of self-worth and prestige for youth and provides
opportunities to participate in a modern
and adventurous-looking vocation. Their role as
journalists also makes it possible for them to
approach decision makers and experts for their
opinions on issues that affect youth. Fourth,
media projects provide publicity to particular
youth issues and thus allow local community
projects to find a much larger following nationwide.
Fifth, developing media products about
youth helps Palestinian youth to consider how
they want to be seen even because images of
them are being broadcast locally and abroad by
others. Because Palestinian youth are well
aware of the bipolar images of violent activism
and helpless suffering that others have of
them, critical reflection through the production
of their own images has helped to open up
space for more nuanced portrayals of youth in
Palestine.


The combination of peer-to-peer activities
and media projects is characteristic of the over-all
philosophy of PYALARA. Combined, the
effect is particularly felicitous: The first type of
activities help youth to work through issues
on an interpersonal, face-to-face level, and the
second, media-based interventions make it possible
to disseminate the perspectives of youth to

[p. <i>430</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000283337-I00468&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like many other Palestinian NGOs,
PYALARA works hard at making itself a nurturing
"family" for the youth who participate,
providing a sense of belonging and participation
in a supportive group conducive to personal
growth.


Of course, the focus of PYALARA is not just
the youth themselves. Much energy is expended
to network with the larger community at local,
district, and national levels. PYALARA's projects
provide opportunities for youth to relate directly
with decision makers, schools, educational and
health services, churches, mosques, professionals,
businesses, music groups, and community clubs.
Media and social interventions open up avenues
for youth who want to relate to various community
services and activities while simultaneously
making community institutions responsive to the
needs of youth. This "community capacity building,"
whereby communities are identified and
mobilized to support common goals, is increasingly
seen as facilitating resilience among children
(Kretzman &amp; McKnight, 1993).


Thus, PYALARA's emphasis on promoting
children's rights does not unfold in an abstract,
decontextualized, or rhetorical way. In all its projects,
PYALARA focuses on the local concrete
community issues faced by youth, linking these
local concerns to issues of general rights and
international law to build among youth a sense of
(in)justice as experienced in their own daily
lives. This focus on rights has been especially
important because it has helped to anchor
PYALARA's work to moral values relevant to
daily living. In the Palestinian context, resilience
is not the same as adaptation to an unjust system
such as an occupation, nor does an emphasis on
resilience mean that the need to pursue larger
social change is forgotten (see the critical
remarks about resilience as an approach in Small
&amp; Memmo, 2004). Rather, youth are encouraged
to examine their lives from a perspective of
equity, justice, and human rights. Such a perspective
cannot be guaranteed under conditions
of occupation and ongoing Israeli noncompliance
with principles of international law.
