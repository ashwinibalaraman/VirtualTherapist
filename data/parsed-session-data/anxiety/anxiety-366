<b>Chapter 3</b>

Back at work, I drove myself hard for that which was to
come. I continued to write to Mary in the vein that we
would marry when she graduated. It had been my plan
again to visit the southland and to be married properly at
Mary's home.


At mid-term Mary finished school and went home. By
reason of my low financial status, I somehow felt that I was
not quite prepared to marry. I wrote to Mary telling her
that we would have to wait until late spring. Although she

Mary's mother, whom I had not as yet met, asking her to let
Mary come. I felt that these were the only things I could do
to accomplish our desired purpose.


True to form, Mary arrived early one evening, shortly
after she had received the funds for passage. The following
day we were married in a small church nearby. It was a quiet
and simple ceremony. Afterward, tears came to my eyes, in
part for the simplicity of the ceremony and in part for the
seriousness of the step I had taken. Mary giggled nervously.
