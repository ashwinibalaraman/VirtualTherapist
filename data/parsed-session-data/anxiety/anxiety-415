The cloud of insanity seen from without usually
stimulates the imagination. The nature of the experience
in this cloud has, indeed, been the source of
much speculation, expressed in art, science, fiction,
biography, and poetry. A few persons who found
themselves enveloped by such a cloud have recorded
and published accounts of this unusual experience.
They agree that the experience was unpleasant, difficult
to describe, and, for each, a terrifying and unique
experience for which he knew no precedent. While
cloud-enveloped, each longed to escape into the
familiar clear air and sunshine of normal experience.


My object in this venture is the collection of
some of the personal descriptions of abnormal experience
published by persons who have lived through a
period of mental derangement. Reports of the subjective
experience while on the "inside looking out"
have been assembled and will constitute the basis of
this presentation. My essential concern will be psychological
in the traditional use of the term: that is, pertaining
to activities and reflections of the mind. To
the best of my knowledge there is no previous comprehensive

<i>Collection of Autobiographical Material</i>


Since no bibliographical reference list pertinent to this sort of
material is available, hundreds of books and bound journals that might
contain relevant descriptions of first-hand experience were reviewed. In
order that we might have at least a partial representation of similar
material published in German and French, I secured the assistance of two
psychologists, one born in Germany, whose native tongue was German,
and a second born in France, whose native tongue was French. Each
systematically searched through the German and French psychiatric
journals published between 1830 and 1950. Whenever they encountered
an autobiography of a psychotic person, this autobiography was translated
into English so that the context and meaning of the account could
be preserved as nearly as possible. Portions of this translated material
have been used in the following accounts.


I have retained and cited a fair number of accounts where the
author explicitly stated, "I am not now, nor was I ever insane." I have
also made use of records in which the author never expressed an opinion
of his own sanity, but the record provided clear evidence that others
believed he was at some time insane. With documents of these last two
categories, the retention and use of the material depended on the character
of the contents. Records were used from those cases where, had I
been able to confront the individual with all the facts and asked the
question, "Were you ever insane, or were you ever in such a disturbed
state of mind that you could not have defended yourself against the
allegation of insanity, had it been urged?", the truthful answer would have
had to be, "I might have been insane at that particular time."


This collection of excerpts should enable the reader to gain some
appreciation of the qualities of inner life that other human beings have
experienced when they (as well as the observers who contemplated such
bewildered sufferers) have said, "This is insanity." The self-descriptions of
such inner mental lives constitute the basic material out of which the
subjective psychopathology I shall present has been organized.


In the collection of this subjective material, certain very arbitrary
criteria have been employed for inclusion or exclusion of any particular
record. Only published (book or journal) prima facie autobiographical
material has been included. Not all autobiographical records are written
in the first person ("I did this"), some are cast in the third person ("He
did that"). It is quite possible that some of the material cited may have
been edited and altered in part by someone other than the person who

<i>Examples of Psychopathological Reports</i>


It might be possible to define and delimit those areas in the private
mental life of another person that include severe psychopathological
experiences. It seemed preferable to illustrate by relevant autobiographic
descriptions rather than to attempt to define many of the terms that will
be employed. For example, it seemed easier to accept the concept of
perceived insanity without further attempts to derive a precise definition.


An anonymous patient published in 1856 the following account of
his own period of insanity.


In [sane] consciousness we may suppose the soul resides in its normal
state.... In the rational mind no ideas of external things or their relations are
allowed to enter which do not correspond with realities: thus truth and reason
are maintained. But when insanity takes place, this harmonious confederation
is broken up and each becomes a petty sovereignty independent within itself. A
unity of action is lost, the perceptive faculties become careless, the gates are
thrown open, and any gigantic fantasy may walk boldly in and usurp the seat of
government! ... The ideas of space and time, which are the fundamental conditions
of all thought in rational minds, become confused, or wholly lost....


The first symptom of insanity in my own case was want of sleep....
The very consciousness of the fact that I needed repose, and my efforts to
obtain it, only aggravated my excitement, and my brain grew every day more
disturbed. At last I began to imagine that the final dissolution of all things was
coming on, thus transferring the tumult in my own mind to external nature....


I was lying in an upper room in the house ... and as I looked out at the
dreary weather, everything conspired to favor this delusion. The window curtains
were parted so that the space through which the light came in was in the
form of a steep lattice-roof, such as I remember in the old pictures of the ark.
Here I obtained a short repose, but the pursuing fiend found me again, and
drove me abroad through boundless space. Then every muscle and nerve
seemed wrought to the utmost tension, and I imagined that the world was again
dissolved into chaos, and that all living things had perished, but I had found
out the great secret of Nature, and through me the universe was to be reconstructed.
I thought that I was the living, intelligent principle of electricity, and
that I had power to call into my own person all the electric fluid in the world,

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this time I was very violent, and struggled fiercely with my attendants;
finally, getting no repose, and finding that I saw my friends no more, I despaired
of getting back again, and thought myself a comet--the living intelligent
head of a comet--flying through space with inconceivable velocity, and
passing far beyond the confines of the habitable universe, thus leaving my
friends hopelessly behind me. I lost all sense of time and space. A whizzing and
careering through trackless solitudes, a sense of rapid and lonely motion, at an
incalculable rate, and a sinking of the heart in utter despair, are all I can recollect.
(Anon., 1856a, pp. 30; 32; 34)


This description of the beginning of a psychotic period is representative
of many similar accounts. The sufferer began with insomnia
that led on to a state of mental confusion and uncontrollable turmoil.
His memory of the passing events became faulty; his orientation in space
and time, defective. He never seemed to consider that his confusion might
be a medical problem. He speaks of a "pursuing fiend," of having found
"the great secret of Nature," and the acquisition of the ability to "give
life again to my friends," to impart ideas of a mystical or religious nature.
Other than the difficulty with insomnia, his description was not related to
events or ideas that are part of the natural physical world.


A second excerpt may be taken from Custance's autobiography,
<i>Wisdom, Madness and Folly</i> (1952), which is a rather remarkable account
of the author's many attacks of mania and depression, together
with his attempt to create out of his experiences a philosophy of insanity.
His descriptions are very lucid. I will draw on Custance's account at
many points in the following chapters. In telling of his experience during
an episode of depression he wrote as follows.


I seem shut into myself, withdrawn from real contact with the outer world
as also from contact with God; the sun does not really shine, the trees and fields
are not really green; I am shut in with my thoughts, always of a depressing and
melancholy nature. This sense of isolation, of being cut off from God, one's
fellows and the world, seems to me to be the paramount feature underlying the
whole state....


Moral tension returns in full force. I am haunted by a sense of guilt; my
conscience gives me no rest, even when there do not seem to be any particularly
grievous sins upon it. Whatever I am doing I feel 1 ought to be doing something
else. I worry perpetually about my past sins and failures; not for a moment
can I forget the mess I seem to have made of my life. However I may pray for

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This lament is typical of those which have been recorded by
patients suffering from melancholia. The feelings of self-condemnation,
of having sinned, and of isolation are central. No amount of reassurance
or explanations indicating that the feelings have no basis in fact, provides
consolation to the sufferer.


In contradistinction to this pathological condition of melancholia
is the state of mania. To illustrate this contrast an additional excerpt
from Custance, in which he was trying to describe his experience in the
Universe of Bliss (his term), may be cited.


In connection with the delusions of grandeur and drive for power should
be noted the peculiar sensation ... reminiscent of the cat tribe. I first noted
it in the padded cell at Brixton while in a state of acute mania. I saw a series of
visions which impelled on my consciousness a strong sense of destiny and leadership.
I imagined myself a sort of lion destined to conquer the world, and in conformity
with this delusion paced interminably round and round my cell on the
balls of my feet with a sense of extraordinary muscular looseness or suppleness ...


The only other association of that particular sensation which comes to my
mind is the rather incongruous one of jazz music. In the manic state this sometimes
gives rise to similar sensations, though in this case my movements tend
to be rather faster and the phantasy is not so much one of being a lion or tiger
as a savage dancing a war-dance.


Another symptom is the ability to see visions in the form of illusions, that
is to say distortion of visual images. This power is proportionate to the acuteness
of the mania. At the present time I am seeing no visions. In periods of acute
mania they can appear almost like a continuous cinema performance, particularly
if there are any complicated and variable light-patterns with which my
optical mechanism can play the necessary tricks. These visions generally appear
on the walls of my room, if these are shiny enough to reflect light. They are
infinitely varied, and bear a close relation to the processes of thought passing in
my mind at the time. They are obvious products of the Unconscious, which in
this state is of course largely in control of my mind ...


With visions are associated dreams. When in the state of acute mania it is
not always easy to separate the two. There is a very close correlation between
dreams and waking thoughts and imaginings. I wake up and my mind carries
on the same train of thought which has been begun in a dream. I go to sleep
and go on dreaming about the subjects I have been thinking about. This is presumably
to be expected since both dreams and the visions and trains of thought
in mania are governed by the Unconscious....


That concludes, I think, this rather overlong catalogue of the features and
symptoms of the manic state as I have experienced it. It may sound a delightful
condition. Perhaps it would be if it were not such a nuisance to others and did
not so easily change into its opposite. (Custance, 1952, pp. 55-57; 58; 59)

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Both the content and the style of this excerpt should be noted. The
inner experience of the maniacal patient is confused by distractability,
press of activity, and changeable themes of thought. It is one of the
very few varieties of psychopathology that is ever reported by patients
to be, in any sense, pleasurable or pleasant. But, as Custance said, it is not
truly delightful.


Another description of still another variety of the inner life of the
distraught or deranged personality may be cited: the condition known as
a phobic neurosis. This excerpt comes from the autobiography of W. E.
Leonard, a well-known Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin.
He wrote an account of his life published under the title of <i>The
Locomotive-God</i>, a document often quoted by psychologists. This excerpt
is illustrative of a profound phobic state.


My central dominating phobia [is one] of distance.... But the <i>form</i> of
itself will lack adequate motivation for consciousness. So the mind feigns motivation....
With the knowledge I now have of the real causes, the spells of diffused
terror have apparently become negligible as long as I am in good physical
tone.... I always knew that the terror was without adequate motivation. I
could only say; as soon as I get a certain distance from home.... I am over-whelmed
with a feeling of insecurity, of terror that I can't get back. The truest
statement of the conscious content is this: I am in a terror of the seizure of
terror; and I fear seizure at a given distance....


For the emotion in the distance-phobia, as for the emotion in all others,
there have been clearly defined degrees of intensity. Let me assume I am
walking down University Drive by the Lake. I am a normal man for the first
quarter of a mile; for the next hundred yards I am in a mild state of dread,
controllable and controlled: for the next twenty yards in an acute state of
dread, yet controlled; for the next ten, in an anguish of terror that hasn't
reached the crisis of an explosion; and in a half-dozen steps more I am in as
fierce a panic of isolation from help and home and of immediate death as a
man overboard in mid-Atlantic or on a window-ledge far up in a sky-scraper
with flames lapping his shoulders.... My phobic seizures at their worst approach
any limits of terror that the human mind is capable of in the actual
presence of death in its most horrible forms. (Leonard, 1939, pp. 321-322)


There can be no doubt concerning the central theme of Leonard's
disorder--<i>fear</i>, an unreasonable and uncontrollable fear that was essentially
a fear of death. Leonard thought he had traced the origin of the
fear to a childhood experience of being frightened by a locomotive plus
diffuse ideas of the malevolence of God, but having traced the fear back
to its origin in his childhood experience, he remained unable to achieve a
reasonable state of self-control.


These four samples of psychopathological experience convey some
idea of the nature and major varieties of derangement with which we
shall deal in the chapters that follow.

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Divergent Attitudes</i>


The excerpts just given serve as a basis for the recognition of the
basic difference between two general social attitudes toward the phenomena
of derangement. Most men have been inclined to believe that a
psychotic person has lost or misused his mental faculties so that his disordered
mind can no longer function adequately. This loss or misuse is
generally attributed to the idea that in the person's past he has disregarded
the moral, ethical, and religious standards of healthy existence.
Since most normal individuals believe that they are masters of their own
minds, souls, and destinies, it follows that the regaining of a lost mind, or
the rehabilitation of a misused mind, should be facilitated by removing
the bewildered person from free society, affording him asylum, where,
with the support of moral guidance, he may regain self-control and the
proper use of his mind. Such, in essence, is the common sense belief of
most persons, including most of those who are, or who have been,
mentally ill at one time or another.


A smaller fraction of mankind believes and attempts to demonstrate
that almost all deranged persons are actually sick or diseased in the same
sense that a person who has cancer is sick or diseased. This smaller fraction
of mankind avers that a deranged person should be placed under
the care and supervision of properly trained medical specialists so that
they may use their skill in the application of the healing arts and sciences
in the treatment and care of such mentally disturbed persons. This smaller
fraction of society would also insist that the ultimate decision as to
whether an individual is sane or insane is not a matter to be determined
by either a general social group, by legal authorities, or by the judiciary,
but one that should be established by medically trained specialists whose
judgments would depend, insofar as possible, on medical considerations.
To summarize these two attitudes: most individuals will say when trying
to deal with a deranged person, "He is obviously insane, he is a sinner,
he must repent"; but a smaller fraction of the general public will say, "He
is sick; physicians should attempt to assist him in the recovery of his
health." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20444');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20444" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ A recent appraisal of the <i>Popular conceptions of mental health</i> has been published
by J. C. Nunnally, Jr. (1961, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc.),
which assesses these concepts in more detail than we have done here but with the
same general conclusions.</div>


If no more than twenty-five or thirty persons out of each thousand
individuals in the general population are acutely deranged at any time
during their entire life-span, then the number of such persons that any
one of us will encounter during any five-year span of our own lifetime
will be limited. Unless one makes a direct effort or has special opportunities,
he will not have first-hand acquaintance with more than a very few

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Consider again the four illustrative excerpts I have cited. First, it
may be noted that each of these patients emphasized spiritual phenomena
or religious feelings as the most prominent features of the experience.
Second, these persons complained of the fear of death; while a third
complaint revolved about the loss of personal self-control. Each patient
did mention a few physical symptoms, such as insomnia, increased
muscular tension, perceptual distortion, or a run-down physical state.
None intimated that his disturbed state of mind seemed to him to be a
problem which demanded medical attention. It is these first-hand considerations--
the leading complaints of the patients--that give rise to and
maintain the common-sense belief that insanity is related to sin and
guilt.


What then gives support to the more modern belief that deranged
states of mind are primarily medical problems which should properly be
part of the general field of medicine? There are two major reasons. The
first is that during the past half century, medical and biological research
has devised methods of treatment which have solved the problems of
approximately a quarter of the miscellany of deranged patients who were
confined in mental hospitals in 1900. (Some of these methods were
"rational," in that the isolation of the relationship between cause and cure
was established; others were "irrational" in that no such relationship has
been established between the therapy and the cure--for example, electric
convulsive therapy.) Second, the methods of psychotherapy have produced
improvement or cure in many persons who were suffering from
the milder forms of neurosis and occasionally have been helpful among
patients suffering from psychosis.


Unfortunately, "moral therapy," which was fashionable during the
nineteenth century, and "pastoral counseling," which has more or less
replaced the older moral therapy during the twentieth century, cannot
point to any tabulated record of therapeutic success. Many patients continue
to seek a therapy that somehow seems to be related to the problems
that seem so vital to their mental turmoil, and the procedures employed
by physicians may be resented by the deranged patients themselves, who
find the methods inappropriate for the relief of their mental ferment.


Physicians are legally licensed and accorded many special privileges
by society. Their license is given because they have participated in a
special course of training which has acquainted them with the body of
knowledge relevant to the art of healing, knowledge, that has been accumulated
over the past centuries and that constitutes today the disciplines
of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, and psychotherapy. Physical
medicine and surgery are comprised of arts, skills, and factual material.

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As an example of the difficulty of communication between such
ordinary hospital doctors and a deranged patient, we may cite the following
excerpt from Hennell's autobiography, <i>The Witnesses</i>. Hennell, an
artist, had been mentally disturbed for some time and had protested
against the lack of intelligent care as well as the unenlightened treatment
he had received. Finally, two members of the hospital staff interviewed
him. The following is Hennell's account of their conversation.


Two doctors approach for conversation: they wish to ascertain my
progress and present mental condition; and thus they introduce the subject:


<i>Dr. Craugasides</i>: We understand that you are conscious of audible
voices which utter words that excite you, or move you to behave violently and
irresponsibly. Is this so? What are these voices and do you believe in their
reality?


<i>Myself</i>: Yes, sir; I hear voices distinctly, even loudly; they interrupt us
at this moment. It is more easy for me to listen to them than to you; I can more
easily believe in their significance and actuality, and they do not ask questions.


<i>Dr. Embásichytros</i>: How can you say that these hallucinations are more
real than ourselves? You must realize that you are talking unreasonably.


<i>Myself</i>: There is more sympathy between my own experience of nature
and these voices, which seem to be the voices of nature, than between my
acquired rationalization of experience and that which seems to be yours; and
therefore I say that their unfinished forms are truer than your conventional
views.


<i>Dr. C.</i>: But surely you do not mean to shut yourself up from society
by paying attention to these delusive ideas. Surely you wish to be cured of
them, and to return well to your parents. Do you not? What is the nature of
these voices?


<i>Myself</i>: They assume the nature of all those objects through which
they speak--whether they speak out of walls, from ventilators, or in the woods
and fields.


<i>Dr. E.</i>: Dear me, this is very interesting: and what do they say?


<i>Myself</i>: Sometimes they speak secretly and guardedly: and then I want
to listen and make sense of their meaning, for it is outside myself, and I only
partly understand it.


<i>Dr. C.</i>: And what do they ever say that you do understand?


<i>Myself</i>: Sometimes they are provoked or tormented, and then they
cry
out, "Fight the fools!" "Why don't you beat these bloody swindlers?" or "You

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As the two mental practitioners went away, I fancied in their expressions
the signs of pained disapproval: presently it was made clear to me that by
accurate definition I had not improved my case. To dispute with men whose
credit and superior qualifications of mind depend on basically opposite axioms
to one's own is a more vain recourse than straw applied to smother a fire.
(Hennell, 1938, pp. 181-183)


Actually, this interview was an attempt on the part of the physicians
to evaluate whether Hennell was well enough to be transferred to another
institution where close confinement was not required. The excerpt illustrates
the point of the difference between the ideas of a mentally disturbed
patient and the physicians in charge of his care. Note that Hennell
said: "There is more sympathy between my own experience of nature and
these voices ... than that which seems to be yours," which is to say that
he was convinced of his own ideas even though the doctor had just told
him that he was talking irrationally.


Many psychiatrists with years of clinical experience would react
after hearing such a conversation with a mental patient in much the same
way that these doctors did. The psychiatrist has become acquainted with
certain appropriate questions and the expected answers, which are, so far
as he is concerned, relevant. Every practicing clinical psychiatrist learns
to listen by a method of selective attention to the recital of the symptoms
and complaints of psychotic patients. Indeed, every educated person
uses selective attention in reacting to the words and behavior of all
persons with whom he comes in contact. The point is that the verbal
productions, the accounts of experience which are made by psychotics,
are diverse, differing from time to time and from person to person, and
the fact that the expressions used seem to be repetitious does not mean
that the one who has listened has any real understanding of the information
which the patient has attempted to convey.


<i>Selective Factors in the Choice of Material</i>


It is noteworthy that many deranged persons have written that
they did not have words or phrases which would adequately describe
their feelings or their experiences, but even so, they did continue with
their descriptions in the evident hope that readers would comprehend
their accounts, even if the words and phrases were not particularly
appropriate. A selective factor which operated in my choice of illustrative
excerpts grew out of the fact that the material sought and used had
to be fairly lucid and presented in literate fashion. I undoubtedly
favored those records that were both clearly descriptive and succinct
enough to be easily quoted. For example, a record that stated, "I became

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A second selective element derives from the system of thought that
readers may be accustomed to using. If one is accustomed to the use of
mystical and religious phrases and descriptions, the reports of mental
patients may seem only slightly misleading; but if the reader has been
trained in medical and biological terminology alone, the descriptions
given by deranged persons may convey but little sense.


Most present-day psychiatrists and clinical psychologists have been
trained to attend to reports that may be interpreted in the psychoanalytic
frame of reference. Only when one turns back over half a century to the
psychology of William James does one find a systematic viewpoint that
will readily accommodate the <i>phenomenological</i> reports the deranged
patient commonly uses. For example, one finds in James' (1890) <i>Principles
of Psychology</i> (Vol. 2) such chapter headings as "The Stream of
Thought," "The Perception of Time," "Imagination," "The Perception of
Reality," and "Will." In James' <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>
(1902) one finds chapters entitled "The Reality of the Unseen," "The
Divided Self," "Conversion," "Saintliness," and "Mysticism." The phenomenological
reports of patients who experienced periods of mental
derangement during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries
have been largely concerned with topics that are covered by subject
headings of the sort that James organized.


Starting about 1930, one finds some reports by patients that do
employ certain psychodynamic phrases and concepts current in modern
psychiatry in the descriptions of their experiences. The use of the
phraseology of these concepts, however, does not mean that the patient
has accepted the viewpoint.


To summarize, I am aware that selective factors operated in the
choice of the material which composes the main body of the autobiographical
accounts which have been utilized. Considering the nature of
the description of the experiences, I can only say that I think I was aware
of the more obvious selective factors and have tried to guard my comments
accordingly.


<i>Grouping of the Material</i>


It should be made explicit that the selected excerpts were originally
randomly gathered, photostated, and grouped according to no self-evident
system. Since the material that constitutes the text consists for the most
part of descriptive excerpts taken from autobiographical accounts, the
method of classification and the use of the material may be clarified as

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went out of my head and wrote to my sister that I was crazy. The voices
told me that I was and that they were going to kill me. The Devil offered me
unlimited power if I would do his bidding. He said he would give me half of
hell to rule over when I died. He would under no condition let me go to heaven
because I knew too much about him and would put him out of business. I was
supposed to rule the world and wipe out civilization. There was a new force
by which the mind of man could be controlled. It came from another planet,
and it manifested itself through me. (Fodor, 1945, p. 382)


This excerpt was classified as being an example of <i>onset</i> (went out
of my head); <i>voices</i> (voices told me); <i>being persecuted</i> (going to kill
me); <i>demons</i> (the Devil); <i>mysticism</i> (mind of man could be controlled);
<i>power</i> (unlimited power); <i>revelation</i> (He said he would give me); and
so on. The most startling statement, which caught my immediate attention,
was, "I wrote to my sister that I was crazy," while the description of
his experience does seem to justify his statement. There is no single part
of this excerpt that is particularly obscure or unclear. Anyone reading
this excerpt should be able to understand what this patient said about
himself and, to a certain extent, sympathize with the delusional and
mystical experiences that troubled him.


As a second example, let us take the description published more
than a century ago (1854) by a recovered mental hospital patient who
was attempting to characterize his asylum experiences.


The first thing I remember which seems to savor of insanity was a presentment
of some great evil which was to befall me, either in my own person,
or to those nearest and dearest to me... I fancied that if I was to leave home
for a while I should find something to banish trouble. I left my parents to spend
the winter among friends and relatives, yet the grim phantom of coming evil
haunted my slumbers, and I found, like Noah's dove, no rest for the sole of
my foot. I was ashamed to tell my friends the fears which tormented me, and
at length became so weary of myself that life seemed a burden. I dreaded to
pass a grave yard, it would cause a faintness, and deathly sensations to see a
coffin, or read of young persons who had recently died. I struggled against
these fantasies, but I grew thin and pale, lost strength rapidly, and my friends
became alarmed. I could not eat, food was repulsive. I could not sleep quietly,
for in dreams I saw my father drowning, my little brother dying, and I arose
each morning pale and haggard. Society had no charms for me, the faces of
my former associates became almost repulsive, and I sought in the solitude of
my room for relief by looking in my Bible in a haphazard manner, for some
particular verses to speak comfort... I read the Bible and Commentaries from
morning till night. I wept, I prayed, but no comforter came, reason tottered
on its throne.... I was insane, and every step of my journey home only
increased the evil. (Anon., 1854a, p. 48)

This excerpt was classified as an example of <i>fear</i> and <i>self-reference</i>
(presentiment of great evil which was to befall me), <i>death fear</i> and
<i>dread</i> (I dreaded to pass a graveyard), <i>onset</i> and <i>melancholia</i> (no comforter
came, reason tottered on its throne), and so forth.


The classified excerpts were sorted so that all material relevant to
the selected topics could be separately indexed. Each grouping was
then further examined so that they might be combined into more generalized
headings. After some "cutting and fitting" the material was
organized under twenty-two more general headings that constitute most
of the chapters that follow.


As I have said, the excerpts are cited verbatim and each excerpt
illustrates more or less precisely the ideas which it seemed to me that the
patient was attempting to convey. I have inserted, between the excerpts,
explanations, condensations, generalizations, cross references, and comments
of my own, together with other relevant material. Each chapter
will begin with an Introduction, which is, in effect, a stage setting,
furnishing the ground on which the "figure" of the excerpts may stand out
for the reader to scrutinize. Each chapter will conclude with a Discussion,
in which an attempt will be made to clarify--and, if possible, unify--the
figure-ground relationships that have been presented.


<i>Psychological Organization</i>


Almost all the excerpts presented are taken from the published
accounts of deranged persons who had no more than common sense to
guide their exposition. The abnormal experience was, for the majority
of sufferers, quite new and unique. Only a handful of excerpts could be
drawn from the records of persons who had had more than one episode
of derangment, who had even read or heard of the experiences that
other deranged sufferers had had, or had read the explanations that any
authority had offered.


The concepts of the <i>Stream of Conscious Thought</i> and <i>Consciousness
of Self</i> as they were formulated by William James have served as a
basis for the explanatory schemes I have adopted on several occasions in
the chapters to follow. My use of either of these organizational concepts
has been tentative and illustrative only.


In dealing with many of the excerpts I have come upon accounts
where the patient stated or implied that one part of his mental life
seemed to proceed in an independent fashion which was more or less
critical of the remainder of his mental life as it was occurring at any
particular time. This phenomenon or experience has been well expressed
in a line of verse by Kipling: "Stood by an' watched myself behaving like
a bloomin' fool." Another poet spoke of the experience that occurred just

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This divided self has gone by many names and has had a wide
variety of characterizations in various languages, systems of thought, and
systems of psychology. James recognized it as a function of self-consciousness;
McDougall spoke of it as the self-regarding tendency; in his
earlier theorizing, Freud called it the psychic censor. Various patients,
whose descriptions I will cite, speak of "part of myself," "my better
judgment," "the essential me," and so forth. Some have gone so far as to
speak of a dwarf that dwells just behind the eyes, who tries to regulate
their behavior.


In an attempt to gain a certain degree of uniformity of characterization
of such a mental process, I will adopt a new name to designate this
process or function. Since it does have, among other qualities, the properties
of Essential Discrimination among Intellectual processes and also
deals with Traces of Recall, I will speak of it as the EDITOR process,
which accompanies the stream of conscious thought.


The EDITOR process continues during almost all one's waking
existence, functioning in the observation, comparison, recording, recalling,
and interpreting of all that goes on in the major stream of one's
mental existence. The remainder of the stream of conscious thought may
rush by in a tumultuous fashion while the EDITOR process acts to
classify parts of it as usual or unusual, commonplace or startling,
tranquil or disturbing, and either under or beyond voluntary control.


The duration and degree of the fragmentation of the stream of
conscious thought, together with disturbances in environmental circumstances,
may be so intense or prolonged that the EDITOR function may
become confused, unclear, and even "unconscious." When this occurs,
the EDITOR process may give rise to such conclusions as, "I have lost
control of my mind," or "I am insane." The degree, duration, and
circumstances that must occur before such a mental self-judgment
may be made are most various.


The topics of this chapter have been touched on in only a superficial fashion.
There is a large library of material in philosophy, psychology,
medicine, and literary speculation that is relevant to many of
the subjects raised. The purpose of my discussion is not to evaluate,
praise, or condemn any system of classification of the behavior disorders
or viewpoint as to their possible origin. Rather, I wish to present the
accounts of those persons who have experienced at one or another period
of their life some variety of mental derangment so that each individual
may speak for himself with the greatest possible clarity. Such systematic
organization on the part of the reporters as does occur in these individual
reports, I will refer to as being <i>common sense</i>.

<b>SUMMARY</b>


The following text will be concerned with the nature of subjective
experience commonly called psychopathological. The varieties of psychopathological
experience encompass a wide range of qualities of human
mental life, varying from extremely agitated manic madness to mildly
annoying trancelike states. The common qualities these pathological
states possess are, (1) a disturbance in thought process, (2) an uncertain
emotional feeling state, and (3) some degree of apprehension about
one's ability to control voluntarily one's thoughts and actions.


A primary concept in the presentation of this material concerns the
nature of the stream of conscious thought that occurs during these
episodes of unusual experience. I have found the psychological frame-work
presented by William James to be very useful for the better comprehension
of the autobiographical records of psychopathological experience.


There are two general attitudes society has held regarding the
phenomena of psychopathology. The first and more generally accepted
attitude, really part of common sense, is that these abnormal experiences
are causally related to guilt and sin. The second attitude, which has much
more relation to present-day scientific thought, is that mental pathology
is a disease process in the same sense that tuberculosis or high blood
pressure are disease processes. If mental aberrations are basically forms
of disease, then these unusual phenomena belong in the realm of medicine.
The fact that practically every modern institution which is dedicated
to the care of persons who suffer from one or another form of
psychopathology is called a hospital and is under medical supervision is
evidence of the prevalence of the second attitude. Most mental hospitals
have an admission service where acutely disturbed patients receive, as
a routine measure, adequate medical care and treatment. But, if the
mental status of the patient does not improve during the initial months
of medical care and treatment, the person is usually moved to the
chronic or "back-ward" section of the institution, where custodial care
constitutes the therapeutic effort and from which effort not too many
recoveries result. The result of the interaction of these two attitudes, sin
and disease, is that society at large continues to suspect and distrust anyone
who has suffered from either prolonged or acute periods of marked
psychopathological experience. Almost every individual hesitates to admit
having lived through such abnormal experiences--not that there was
any doubt in his mind about the occurrence, but because the very fact of
the public admission of having experienced a period of unsound mind
raises fears, doubts, and questions in the minds of his fellow men, which
questions usually bear more on his ethics and morality than on his health.


Many problems arise regarding social status and social interaction

The words and phrases that any individual used were limited by
his working vocabulary. For example, an examining physician once
asked a patient, "Are you bothered by stolen thoughts?" To this question
the patient replied, "Oh, so that's what you call them," and then
went on to describe this experience in great detail.


The next three chapters (Chapters 2, 3, and 4) will deal with the
beginning, the course, and the recovery from mental derangement.
For the most part, the emphasis in these particular chapters will be on
the temporal course of abnormal experience. The qualitative nature of
the phenomena will be dealt with in Chapters 5 through 19. Chapters 20
and 21 will present a few speculative conclusions drawn from the
material that has been presented.

<i>So the last connected and coherent thing in my thinking
gave way--and the Madness filing me rejoiced. Because
at last there was nothing to stay it, it shouted and exulted
with a noise that tore my throat out, charging through me
till it nearly dragged the life out of me. Part of my mind
stood there and took in the whole situation, yet could do
nothing about it. The thing that was raging did not seem
wrong to me then--but the rightest thing in the world--a
magnificent accomplishment.</i>
