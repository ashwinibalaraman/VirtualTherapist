One of the major developments in the
field of close relationships has been
the move toward more theoretically
grounded research. In the area of adult love relationships
in particular, much of the early
work was largely atheoretical and tended to
focus on describing various forms or styles of
love. By contrast, now it is widely accepted
that researchers need to formulate and test theories
that explain how and why the different
forms of love develop. Attachment theory is
one of the major perspectives that has been applied
in this area.


Recent attempts to understand adults' close
relationships from an attachment perspective
draw heavily on Bowlby's (1969, 1973, 1980)
ethological theory of attachment. Bowlby's
work integrated observational studies of
mothers and their offspring, both human and
primate. The resulting theoretical formulation
highlighted the importance of the bond between
infants and their primary caregivers,
suggesting that such a continuing bond is crucial
for children's social and emotional development.


- <b>Infant Attachment</b>


Bowlby (1973) defined attachment behavior
as "any form of behavior that results in a person
attaining or retaining proximity to some
other differentiated and preferred individual,
usually conceived as stronger and/or wiser"
(p. 292). He saw attachment behavior as having
evolved through natural selection, offering
infants a survival advantage by protecting
them from danger. Specific attachment behaviors,
such as crying and clinging, form an
organized behavioral system. That is, they
serve the common goal of keeping the attachment

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The claim that attachment behavior has
evolved through natural selection implies that
its functions apply universally as part of the
ground plan of the species. At the same time,
Bowlby (1973) emphasized individual differences
in attachment behavior. He argued that,
throughout childhood and adolescence, individuals
gradually build up expectations about
the responsiveness of their attachment figures.
These expectations, and the associated memories
and beliefs about early interactions, are
incorporated into "working models" of attachment
that shape behavior in later relationships.


Individual differences in attachment behavior
were highlighted by Ainsworth, who
developed a laboratory technique (the Strange
Situation) for assessing infant attachment
styles based on infants' reactions to separations
from and reunions with mothers and
strangers (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall,
1978). Secure infants explore actively in their
mothers' presence and, although upset by separation,
are readily comforted on reunion;
their mothers are warm and responsive.
Avoidant infants appear to be detached and
avoid close contact with their mothers; their
mothers tend to be distant or rigid. Anxious-ambivalent
infants show extreme distress on
separation and show anger or ambivalence on
reunion; their mothers tend to be insensitive
or inconsistent.


Although researchers have debated the reliability
and validity of infant attachment
styles, there is evidence that these styles are
relatively stable if family circumstances are
stable (Main, Kaplan, &amp; Cassidy, 1985) and
that they predict later social functioning
(Youngblade &amp; Belsky, 1992). It also should
be noted that attachment theory and research
have vital practical applications with regard to
the quality of child care including the care of
hospitalized and institutionalized children.


- <b>Attachment Relationships
Beyond Childhood</b>


Although Bowlby focused on childhood attachment,
he saw the attachment system as
playing a crucial role across the life span.
Similarly, Ainsworth (1989) and Weiss
(1986, 1991) argued that some adult relationships
meet the criteria of attachment bonds.
That is, adults sometimes seek closeness to
relationship partners (proximity seeking) and
experience distress if partners become unavailable
(separation protest), they derive
confidence and security from relationships
(secure base), and they turn to partners for
comfort during times of stress (safe haven).
Weiss (1991) also noted other important similarities
between childhood attachments and
some adult relationships. For example, in
both childhood and adulthood, individuals
develop a sense of being bonded to specific
partners. This bonding persists, despite episodes
of negativity in relationships, and loss
of such partners leads to grief and mourning.


Based on these points, Ainsworth (1989)
and Weiss (1991) identified marital and other
committed romantic relationships as the
prime examples of adult attachments. For this
reason, the present chapter focuses on romantic
attachments. Before exploring this area in
detail, however, we recognize that other close
relationships can constitute attachments.
Weiss (1991) argued that relationships between
adults and their parents can show properties
of attachment bonds, as can some close
friendships and ongoing patient-therapist relationships.

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There has been little systematic study of
adult siblings as attachment figures. Yet, researchers
have noted that sibling relationships
can serve a number of developmental functions
across the life span and that attachment
bonds between adult siblings are possible
(Cicirelli, 1995; Hazan &amp; Shaver, 1994). As
already noted, young children are thought to
form secondary attachments to older siblings.
This claim is supported by studies of the
Strange Situation, in which older siblings often
take an active role in comforting infants
distressed by their mothers' departures (Stewart,
1983). Support for sibling attachments beyond
childhood comes from recent studies of
young adult samples. Feeney and Humphreys
(1996) found that many respondents rated siblings
as important figures in terms of providing
closeness (proximity seeking), comfort
(safe haven) and security (secure base), although
siblings tended to be eclipsed as attachment
figures by parents and romantic
partners. Similarly, Trinke and Bartholomew
(1997) found that, in terms of overall strength
of attachment, siblings ranked behind partners,
mothers, and fathers but ranked above
best friends. Based on reported patterns of behavior,
judges classified 58% of participants
as being "attached" to at least one sibling; for
8% of participants, a sibling was the primary
attachment figure. Together, these results suggest
that adult sibling relationships merit further
research.


- <b>Romantic Relationships
as Attachments</b>


Despite similarities between infant attachments
and romantic relationships, romantic
attachment received little attention before
Hazan and Shaver's (1987) seminal studies.
Adult attachment had been measured previously
using the Adult Attachment Interview
(AAI) (George, Kaplan, &amp; Main, 1985). The
AAI is not considered in detail in this chapter
because it assesses current thinking about
childhood attachment rather than romantic attachment.
Nevertheless, we note that there is
some convergence between the AAI and measures
of romantic attachment (Bartholomew
&amp; Shaver, 1998).


<b><i>Early Studies of Romantic
Attachment</i></b>


Hazan and Shaver (1987) reported two
studies of romantic love using a simple three-paragraph
measure designed to capture the
features of the major attachment styles (secure,
avoidant, and anxious-ambivalent) extrapolated
from studies of infant attachment.
Participants (respondents to a "Love Quiz" in
a local newspaper and a sample of undergraduates)
were asked to choose the paragraph that
best described their feelings in close relationships
and to complete questionnaires assessing
aspects of childhood and adult relationships.
The three groups defined by the forced-choice
measure of attachment style differed
predictably in their reports of early family relations,
beliefs about love relationships, and
love experiences. Table 14.1 provides a summary
of results.


In addition to these empirical studies,
Shaver and colleagues (Shaver &amp; Hazan,
1988; Shaver, Hazan, &amp; Bradshaw, 1988) presented
a theoretical analysis of romantic love
as attachment. This analysis dealt with the relationship
between love and attachment, love
as the integration of behavioral systems, and
previous conceptualizations of love. In terms
of the relationship between love and attachment,
Shaver and Hazan (1988) argued for
strong parallels between infant attachment
and romantic love. These parallels included
the dynamics of the two types of relationships
(similar to Weiss's [1991] work on the role of
proximity seeking, secure base, etc.) but also
pointed to behavioral and emotional similarities
(e.g., frequent eye contact, holding, powerful
empathy).

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00210&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I003&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

With regard to the integration of behavioral
systems, Shaver and Hazan (1988) noted two
clear differences between infant attachment
and romantic love. Infant-caregiver bonds
have highly asymmetrical patterns of
caregiving, as the term <i>caregiver</i> implies. By
contrast, romantic love usually involves reciprocal
caregiving. Furthermore, unlike infant
attachment, romantic love almost always has a
sexual component. These points led Shaver
and Hazan to describe romantic love as the integration
of attachment, caregiving, and sexuality.
Similarly, Bowlby (1969) argued that
these three behavioral systems worked together
to ensure the survival of the species.
The three systems can vary in importance in
different love relationships and at different
points in time. The attachment system, however,
is central; it is the first system to appear
developmentally and, hence, influences the
development of the others (Shaver et al.,
1988).


Compared to previous conceptualizations
of love, the attachment perspective offers important
advantages (Shaver &amp; Hazan, 1988).
It is firmly grounded in theory, whereas many
earlier studies of love lacked a theoretical
base. The attachment perspective also is integrative
in several senses: It is developmental
in nature, linking romantic love with early social
experiences; it explains both healthy and
unhealthy forms of love; and it encompasses
related concepts such as grief and loneliness.


Hazan and Shaver's early work on attachment
soon was followed by reports from other
researchers involving replications and extensions
of their work and tests of their theoretical
formulation. For example, Shaver and
Hazan (1988) had proposed that previous conceptualizations
of love (including theories of
anxious love) could be subsumed within attachment
theory. Questionnaire studies using
multiple measures of romantic love largely
supported this proposition (Feeney &amp; Noller,
1990; Levy &amp; Davis, 1988). At the same time,
the studies showed a need to qualify some of
Shaver and Hazan's (1988) assertions. These
researchers had equated anxious love with
anxious-ambivalent attachment, but measures
of anxious love proved to be multidimensional,
with one aspect (self-conscious anxiety
in dealing with partners) characterizing
both avoidant and anxious-ambivalent persons
(Feeney &amp; Noller, 1990).


An important question addressed in another
early study concerned the <i>salience</i> of attachment-related
issues. Feeney and Noller
(1991) noted that existing studies in the area
had relied primarily on questionnaire measures
of attachment style. These measures

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00211&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If you've got someone who "love you,"
"love you" all the time, then you don't want
it much. But if you think that they're interested
in someone else, then you want them.
It adds excitement to the relationship.


I need heaps of comfort and physical affection.
And my partner is extremely affectionate,
which suits me down to the ground. I've
always, always craved affection all my life,
mainly through parental—bad parental relationships.


<b><i>Issues of Conceptualization
and Measurement</i></b>


Since Hazan and Shaver's (1987) studies
of attachment style, issues concerning conceptualization
and measurement have been
focal. Their original measure was intuitively
appealing, being based on a simple typology
that drew parallels with the major infant
styles. However, as Hazan and Shaver noted,
the forced-choice item was severely limited as
a measure of attachment style. Being a single
item, it is likely to have limited reliability, especially
given the complex response options.


The first revision of this measure retained
the three descriptions but required participants
to rate the applicability of each (Levy &amp;
Davis, 1988). This method offers important
advantages over the forced-choice format. It
recognizes that not all persons choosing a
given description will endorse it to the same
degree, nor will they reject the other descriptions
completely. However, this method still is
prone to poor reliability if the original descriptions
are not internally consistent. For
this reason, researchers developed multiple-item
measures by breaking the descriptions
into their separate components. Most factor
analytic studies of these measures yielded two
major factors: comfort with closeness and
anxiety over relationships (for more details,
see Feeney &amp; Noller, 1996). Comfort with
closeness is a bipolar factor that contrasts elements
of the secure and avoidant descriptions
(e.g., "I find it relatively easy to get close to
others" vs. "I am nervous when anyone gets
too close"). Anxiety over relationships reflects
concerns about abandonment and reciprocation
of love, similar to aspects of anxious-ambivalent
attachment (e.g., "I often worry
that my partner doesn't really love me").


While researchers were refining the three-group
measure, Bartholomew (1990) proposed
a four-group typology based on the assertion
that attachment patterns reflect both a
working model of self and a working model of
the attachment figure (Bowlby, 1973). Each of
these models can be broadly dichotomized as
positive or negative. That is, the self can be
seen as worthy of love and attention or as unworthy;
the attachment figure (or "other") can
be seen as caring and available or as uncaring
(Bartholomew, 1990). Combining these dimensions
gives rise to four attachment styles:
secure (positive models of self and other),
preoccupied (positive model of other, negative
model of self; cf. anxious-ambivalent),
dismissing (positive model of self, negative
model of other), and fearful (negative models
of self and other). Bartholomew and Horowitz
(1991) developed prototype descriptions of
the four styles (which could be presented either
in a forced-choice format or with rating
scales) together with interview schedules.
Their empirical data supported the model; the

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recent studies have clarified issues of conceptualization
and measurement. Feeney,
Noller, and Hanrahan (1994) developed a substantial
pool of items covering the basic
themes of attachment theory. Five factors
emerged from the items and were used as
clustering variables in a cluster analysis. The
resulting four groups were largely similar to
those discussed by Bartholomew (1990) but
raised important issues. For example, participants
in the dismissing group were moderately
high in need for approval and preoccupation
with relationships, suggesting that their
attempts to maintain interpersonal distance
might be driven by anxiety and self-doubt.
Similarly, Brennan, Clark, and Shaver (1998)
conducted a cluster analysis based on two
higher order factors (anxiety and avoidance)
derived from all available self-report items.
The resulting four groups again resembled
those described by Bartholomew (1990).


Using confirmatory factor analysis, Griffin
and Bartholomew (1994) demonstrated substantial
convergence across three methods of
measuring adult attachment: self-report, peer-report,
and interview. They also argued for a
"prototype" approach to adult attachment.
This approach regards the four types as important
predictors of relationship outcomes
(adding to the predictive power of the two dimensions)
but recognizes that the boundaries
between them are fuzzy. However, Fraley and
Waller (1998), in their discussion of whether
individual differences in adult attachment
should be conceptualized as types (groups) or
as dimensions, disagreed with this conclusion.
They noted that this question cannot be resolved
by considering issues of convenience,
by examining the distributions of attachment-related
variables, or by using cluster analysis.
Rather, it requires the use of "taxometric"
techniques, designed specifically to assess
whether a construct is best understood in
terms of latent types or dimensions. Taxometric
techniques assess patterns of covariation
between measured indicators of the construct.
Results of these techniques suggest that
differences in adult attachment are best understood
in terms of dimensions (for more details,
see Fraley &amp; Waller, 1998).


In this chapter, research findings are discussed
in terms of both types and dimensions,
according to the measures used by researchers.
Results can be integrated across measures.
Comfort with closeness consistently
orders the attachment groups (secure, preoccupied,
dismissing, and fearful), and anxiety
over relationships separates the preoccupied
and fearful groups from the secure and dismissing
groups (Feeney, 1995, 1999).


<b><i>Stability of
Adult Attachment</i></b>


Given the range of measures outlined heretofore,
it is not surprising that researchers
have debated the reliability of the different
measures and the related question of how stable
adult attachment patterns are over time. To
some extent, the ongoing debate over these
issues reflects a misconception that attachment
theory requires near-perfect stability.
Attachment theorists accept that attachment
style can change, especially in the face of
changing relationship experiences. However,
they propose that working models generally
solidify over time (Shaver, Collins, &amp; Clark,
1996) and that the associated expectations
tend to be self-fulfilling (e.g., expecting others
to be rejecting might lead to a defensive
interpersonal style, resulting in rejection).
This perspective implies a certain degree
of stability in measures of attachment style.


There now are reports of stability rates
over periods from 1 week to 4 years (for details,
see Feeney &amp; Noller, 1996). With categorical
measures (three or four groups), approximately
one in four respondents changes
attachment style from one occasion to the
next. Ratings of attachment prototypes generally
show moderate stability, as do multiple-item
scales.

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What do these data mean? Some researchers
argue that instability stems largely from
measurement error (Scharfe &amp; Bartholomew,
1994), whereas others argue that it reflects
real change (Baldwin &amp; Fehr, 1995). "Instability
as error" is supported by the high stability
of multiple-item scales when they are attenuated
for unreliability and by the fact that
stability is largely unaffected by the time lag
between testing. Furthermore, attempts to assess
dimensional constructs using categories
always underestimate stability (Fraley &amp;
Waller, 1998). However, the substantial rates
of change, even for ratings by trained interviewers,
suggest some "instability as change."
In explaining such change, researchers again
have taken different positions.


First, as already noted, change in attachment
patterns might be especially likely when
relationship experiences change. There is
mixed support for this claim. Baldwin and
Fehr (1995) reported no link between stability
of attachment style and change in relationship
status, and Scharfe and Bartholomew (1994)
found only scattered relations between stability
and life events. However, results in these
studies might have been weakened by the
crude measure of relationship change
(Baldwin &amp; Fehr, 1995) and by the use of participants
in stable relationships (Scharfe &amp;
Bartholomew, 1994). Some support exists for
the link between stability and relationship
events such as involvement in steady and satisfying
relationships (Feeney &amp; Noller, 1992;
Hammond &amp; Fletcher, 1991) and relationship
breakup (Kirkpatrick &amp; Hazan, 1994).


A second perspective on change focuses on
short-term instability rather than on major
change. According to this perspective, individuals
have multiple attachment orientations,
derived over the course of varied relationship
experiences (Baldwin &amp; Fehr, 1995). At
any given point in time, measures of attachment
reflect the attachment orientation elicited
by particular situational factors. This perspective
can accommodate the Finding that
even those in stable relationships show some
instability of attachment patterns. A recent
study (Baldwin, Keelan, Fehr, Enns, &amp; Koh-Rangarajoo,
1996) provides preliminary support
for the proposition that different attachment
orientations can be activated and that
these influence the processing of relational
information.


Finally, a third perspective on instability
has posited change in attachment style as an
individual difference variable. Davila, Burge,
and Hammen (1997) suggested that vulnerability
factors make some people more susceptible
to attachment style change and that these
people are similar to those who are consistently
("stably") insecure rather than to those
who are secure. A longitudinal study of young
women (Davila et al., 1997) generally supported
these predictions, suggesting that adverse
early experiences might be linked to
more tentative views of self and other.


<b><i></i></b><b>Working Models of Attachment</b>


Issues concerning stability are closely
linked to questions about the nature of working
models. Working models reflect the inner
organization of the attachment system and
cannot be observed directly. In this sense, they
are similar to other cognitive structures such
as scripts and schemata. However, working
models of attachment differ from these structures
in important ways: They are explicitly
relational, they involve motivational and behavioral
tendencies as well as conscious
cognitions, they are heavily affect laden, and
they are complex and multidimensional in
structure (Shaver et al., 1996). Attachment
theorists often talk about "models of self and
"models of other," but in a number of ways,
these terms imply an oversimplistic view of
their structures.


First, models of self and models of other
cannot be understood without reference to
each other (Bowlby, 1973). Although the two
types of models are logically independent,
they tend to be complementary. For example,
a child who experiences attachment figures
as very insensitive to his or her needs is likely

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Second, individuals might hold multiple,
and potentially inconsistent, models of self
and other. This situation applies particularly
to dismissing and preoccupied persons, whose
working models of self and other differ in valence
(Klohnen &amp; John, 1998). For example,
preoccupied persons are seen as having a
"positive model of other" and even show a
tendency to idealize partners. However, this
model might act as a defense against a less
conscious, and more negative, model of other.


Third, the term <i>model of other</i> implies a
single model of attachment figures. However,
even young children can have separate models
for different attachment figures, and adults'
representations are likely to reflect the complex
nature of their social experiences. Multiple
models are thought to form a hierarchical
structure (Collins &amp; Read, 1994). Models at
the top of the hierarchy are general and abstract;
they apply widely but might not provide
a good fit to particular situations. Conversely,
models lower in the hierarchy are
more specific, corresponding to particular
types of relationships (e.g., love relationships)
and even to particular partners. These models
might not generalize widely, but they predict
particular situations.


Collins and Read (1994) proposed four interrelated
components of working models:
memories of attachment-related experience;
beliefs, attitudes, and expectations of self and
others; attachment-related goals and needs;
and plans and strategies for achieving these
goals. Research has supported attachment-style
differences in these variables (Feeney &amp;
Noller, 1996) but has relied mainly on self-reports,
which cannot assess structural features
or aspects outside of conscious awareness.
Recent initiatives, however, offer some insight
into the complexity and integration of working
models (Mikulincer, 1995), and their
strength and accessibility, assessed via response
times (Baldwin, Fehr, Keedian, Seidel,
&amp; Thomson, 1993).


What are the functions of working models
of attachment? These models are used to predict
the behavior of others and to plan one's
own behavior to achieve relational goals.
Working models are thought to perform these
functions by guiding emotional, cognitive,
and behavioral responses to relational events
(Collins &amp; Read, 1994). Studies of both hypothetical
and real relationships support this
proposition. For example, when asked to explain
specific partner behaviors in a hypothetical
relationship, insecure individuals are
more likely than secure individuals to focus
on negative factors such as the unresponsive
or rejecting nature of the partner (Collins,
1996). Feeney (1998) studied responses to a
specific event (separation from partner) in real
relationships. As seen in Table 14.2, reports of
emotions, cognitions, and behaviors paint a
consistent picture of the response patterns associated
with each style.


The results just discussed highlight the link
between attachment style and reactions to
negative relationship events. Such findings
bring us to the question of how attachment security
and insecurity are manifested in stressful
situations.


- <b>Attachment, Stress, and Coping</b>


We noted earlier that attachment figures serve
as a safe haven in threatening situations.
Bowlby (1969) discussed three types of situations
that elicit infant attachment behavior:
conditions of the individual (e.g., illness),
conditions of the environment (threats in the
social or physical environment), and conditions
of the relationship (the attachment figure's
absence or discouraging of proximity).
By analogy, similar situations can activate attachment
behavior in adults. For this reason,
several studies have focused on adult attachment
and responses to stress.


In presenting this research, we focus primarily
on stressful events <i>within relationships</i>
because of their central importance to relationship

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Studies of responses to conditions of the
individual and the environment have examined
stressors as diverse as pain and ill health
(Feeney &amp; Ryan, 1994; Mikulincer &amp; Florian,
1998), anticipated involvement in a stressful
experiment (Simpson, Rholes, &amp; Nelligan,
1992), and missile attacks during the Gulf
War (Mikulincer, Florian, &amp; Weller, 1993).
These studies have produced consistent sets of
findings. In stressful situations, secure persons
tend to make lower appraisals of threat
and to seek support from others. Avoidant persons
try to distance themselves from the situation
and are reluctant to seek help and support
even for physical symptoms. Anxious-ambivalent
persons focus on their negative feelings
and report high levels of physical symptoms.


These findings fit with the claim that differences
in attachment style reflect early experiences
of dealing with distress or "affect
regulation" (Kobak &amp; Sceery, 1988). Secure
individuals, experiencing responsive
caregiving, learn to acknowledge distress and
to seek support from others. Avoidant individuals
learn to avoid acknowledging or expressing
distress so as to minimize conflict with insensitive
caregivers. Anxious-ambivalent
individuals focus on distressing thoughts and
feelings in attempting to maintain contact
with inconsistent caregivers. The findings
linking adult attachment with responses to
stress also underline the importance of context.
For example, avoidant persons might be-have
in a distant manner only under stress
(Simpson et al., 1992).


Stressful events within relationships have
been investigated in two ways. First, researchers
have conducted retrospective studies of
separation and reunion. Open-ended reports

Second, stressful events within relationships
have been investigated in terms of relationship
conflict. This topic is addressed in a
later subsection on communication. At this
point, we confine our discussion to two studies
testing theory-based predictions about the
effects of attachment style on responses to different
types of conflict; conflict that appears
to threaten the relationship should produce
stronger effects than conflict that does not.


In one study, data from both "insiders"
(participants) and "outsiders" (trained raters)
linked anxious-ambivalent attachment to
high levels of distress in response to conflict.
Raters also rated the interactions of insecure
participants as lower in quality (Simpson,
Rholes, &amp; Phillips, 1996). As predicted, these
effects were stronger for couples who were
asked to discuss issues of major conflict. Ambivalent
individuals who discussed major issues
perceived their partners more negatively
after the discussions than before, even when
interaction quality was controlled, suggesting
that negative expectations influenced their
perceptions. In the other study (Feeney,
1998), couples took part in three conflict interactions:
one involving a specific issue (leisure
time) and two designed to elicit attachment-related
anxiety. In the latter interactions,
one partner (man or woman, in counterbalanced
order) was primed to reject the other.
For all three interactions, secure individuals
reported more positive expectations. However,
secure attachment was linked to outsider
ratings (of less negative affect and more constructive
behavior) <i>only</i> in response to the
partner's rejection. Thus, attachment differences
again were stronger when conflict was
more threatening. Of course, the destructive
patterns that insecure individuals tend to display
in such situations are likely to exacerbate
the stress being experienced.


- <b>Partners' Attachment Styles</b>


As we already have seen, theoretical and empirical
studies have linked working models of
attachment with expectations of relationship
partners and with responses to stressful events.
These studies suggest that attachment style is
likely to have important implications for relationship
outcomes and processes. Before reviewing
research focusing on these issues, we
need to emphasize that, from the outset,
Hazan and Shaver (1987) called for researchers
to take account of the attachment styles of
both partners in ongoing relationships. Two
major issues are relevant here: whether there
is "partner matching" in terms of attachment
characteristics and whether relationship functioning
is predicted by the attachment style of
the partner (as well as by one's own attachment
style).


<b><i>Partner Matching</i></b>


Do couples pair up on the basis of attachment
style? If so, then do partners tend to be
similar or complementary in style? Studies of
ongoing relationships suggest systematic patterns
of pairing, especially in terms of the tendency
for secure individuals to be paired with
secure partners (Collins &amp; Read, 1990;
Feeney, 1994; Senchak &amp; Leonard, 1992).
There also is evidence that avoidant individuals
tend to be paired with ambivalent partners
(Collins &amp; Read, 1990; Kirkpatrick &amp; Davis,

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hypothetical relationships also have been
used to study partner matching. Pietromonaco
and Carnelley (1994) found that all attachment
groups felt most positive about relationships
with secure partners and that only avoidant
persons differentiated between avoidant
and ambivalent partners (i.e., they felt less
positive about avoidant partners). By contrast,
Frazier et al.'s (1996) studies of hypothetical
relationships suggest that ambivalent individuals
are especially averse to avoidant partners.
Again, these results are difficult to interpret.
The method used in these studies is artificial
in its explicit focus on partner attachment
style and fails to distinguish between what
people <i>think</i> they are attracted to, what they
<i>are</i> attracted to, and what they <i>attain</i>. Without
long-term longitudinal studies, the issue of
partner matching remains unclear. This area
also is marked by confusion concerning theory-based
predictions. Frazier et al. (1996) argued
that matching of similar styles reflects
self-verification (i.e., the tendency to prefer
those who verify one's beliefs). By contrast,
Pietromonaco and Carnelley (1994) invoked
self-verification theory to predict avoidant-ambivalent
matching.


<b><i>Partner Effects</i></b>


Studies of partner matching highlight the
need to consider both partners' attachment
styles. Systematic patterns of pairing imply
that the attachment styles of self and partner
are confounded and that researchers should
try to disentangle the effects of each person's
characteristics. At this point, we simply note
that there is considerable evidence of partner
effects, as mentioned throughout the following
subsections. Partners' attachment styles
also can interact in their effects on relationship
functioning; however, research has only
recently begun to explore this issue.


- <b>Attachment and Relationship
Outcomes</b>


In this section, we briefly review research
linking attachment style with the relationship
outcome variables of quality and stability.
This topic has received considerable attention,
starting with the earliest studies of romantic
attachment.


<b><i>Relationship Quality</i></b>


Hazan and Shaver (1987) reported that secure
attachment was associated with relationships
of higher quality (more happy, friendly,
and trusting). This general finding has been
widely replicated across the range of attachment
measures. Early studies focused primarily
on dating relationships, with some evidence
that relationship evaluations are linked
more strongly to own avoidance (low comfort
with closeness) for men and to own anxious-ambivalence
(high anxiety over relationships)
for women (Collins &amp; Read, 1990; Simpson,
1990). These studies also reported partner attachment
effects, with the most robust finding
being the negative effect of women's relationship
anxiety. Similarly, in a 3-year study of
dating couples, Kirkpatrick and Davis (1994)
found that avoidant men and anxious women
rated their relationships negatively, as did men
paired with anxious women.


Studies of romantic attachment soon were
extended to marital relationships. Senchak
and Leonard (1992) defined attachment at the
couple level, reporting that couples with two

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

More recent studies have extended these
findings in important ways. Feeney, Noller,
and Callan (1994) studied young married couples
over a 9-month period. Concurrent analyses
linked secure attachment (comfort with
closeness, low anxiety over relationships) to
marital satisfaction. Analyses over time were
significant only for husbands; insecurity predicted
later dissatisfaction, but dissatisfaction
also predicted later insecurity (suggesting a
revision of working models). Another study
linked secure attachment to marital satisfaction
across all stages of the marital life cycle
(Feeney, 1994). This study also showed interactive
effects of partners' attachment styles; in
younger couples, the negative effect of wives'
relationship anxiety was particularly marked
when husbands were low in comfort. This
finding is not surprising given that the needs
of wives who are highly anxious and dependent
are unlikely to be met by husbands who
are uncomfortable with intimacy.


<b><i>Relationship Stability</i></b>


Hazan and Shaver (1987) noted that secure
individuals reported the most enduring relationships.
Prospective studies of romantic attachment,
however, have yielded more complex
results. In a 10-week study of dating
individuals, avoidant attachment at Time 1
predicted relationship breakup (Feeney &amp;
Noller, 1992). However, in a 3-year study that
controlled for commitment and prior duration,
the relationships of avoidant men and of anxious
women were quite stable over time
(Kirkpatrick &amp; Davis, 1994); however, as already
noted, these relationships were rated
negatively, showing the importance of the distinction
between relationship quality and
relationship stability.


Kirkpatrick and Hazan's (1994) 4-year follow-up
of Hazan and Shaver's (1987) sample
showed complex links between attachment
and relationship outcomes. Attachment style
at Time 1 was meaningfully related to later relationship
status (e.g., secure persons were the
most likely to be married). However, this prediction
stemmed mainly from the relative stability
of attachment style and was not significant
when Time 2 attachment style was
statistically controlled. Furthermore, although
secure persons reported few relationship
breakups, they were no more likely than insecure
persons to be with the same partners at
each time point. This result reflected the tendency
of some ambivalent persons (28%) to
have broken up with their partners but then reunited.
Hence, the cross-sectional finding that
the relationships of ambivalent persons are
short-lived tells an incomplete story; rather,
they tend to be "on again/off again."


<b><i>Summary of Outcome Research</i></b>


Before leaving this topic, it is important to
note that the link between secure attachment
and relationship outcomes cannot be explained
in terms of personality differences.
Shaver and Brennan (1992) found that attachment
measures showed only modest relations
with personality variables. Furthermore, attachment
measures were more predictive of
relationship outcomes (relationship status,
satisfaction, and commitment) than were personality
measures.


- <b>Attachment and Relationship
Processes</b>


We now review research linking romantic
attachment with relationship processes (caregiving
and sexuality, communication, emotional
experience and expression, and violence).

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Caregiving and Sexuality</i></b>


As noted earlier, Shaver and Hazan (1988)
conceptualized romantic love as the integration
of attachment, caregiving, and sexual behavior.
This model of love has received some
support from empirical studies.


In terms of caregiving, Kunce and Shaver
(1994) developed self-report scales to assess
caregiving style in romantic dyads. These
scales (proximity, sensitivity, cooperation,
and compulsive caregiving) differentiated attachment
groups in a student sample in ways
consistent with attachment theory. For example,
secure and dismissing participants reported
less compulsive caregiving than did
preoccupied and fearful participants, and secure
participants also reported high sensitivity.
In a broad sample of married couples who
completed these scales, secure attachment
was negatively related to compulsive care and
positively related to responsive care (a composite
of proximity, sensitivity, and cooperation)
(Feeney, 1996). Marital satisfaction was
predicted by secure attachment and partner's
responsive care. Similarly, in a study of dating
and married couples, own security of attachment
was related to more beneficial caring for
partner, and satisfaction was predicted by own
attachment and partner's attachment and
caregiving styles (Carnelley, Pietromonaco, &amp;
Jaffe, 1996).


With regard to sexuality, in student samples,
avoidant individuals report the most unrestricted
sexuality (involving nonintimate casual
sex) (Brennan &amp; Shaver, 1995; Feeney,
Noller, &amp; Patty, 1993). Feeney et al. (1993)
also found that anxious-ambivalent males
and avoidant females were the least likely
to report having sexual intercourse during a
6-week diary study. In a somewhat older sample,
Hazan et al. (1994) found consistent links
between sexual styles and attachment styles.
Secure persons reported more mutually initiated
sex and less sex outside of their primary
relationships. Avoidant persons reported more
nonintimate sex. Anxious-ambivalent persons
reported greater enjoyment of holding than of
explicitly sexual behaviors, and anxious-ambivalent
males were more sexually reticent
than their female counterparts (cf. Feeney
et al., 1993). A recent longitudinal study of
young adults also linked attachment to a complex
of attitudes and behaviors relevant to
safer sex (Feeney, Kelly, Gallois, Peterson, &amp;
Terry, in press; Feeney, Peterson, Gallois, &amp;
Terry, 1998). Anxiety over relationships consistently
predicted unsafe sex. However, comfort
with closeness (a dimension of <i>security</i>)
also showed some relations in the direction of
unsafe sex, possibly stemming from lowered
perceptions of risk.


To date, there has been little research investigating
relations among all three components
of the proposed model of love: attachment,
caregiving, and sexuality. Such research
currently is being undertaken, with preliminary
results suggesting that the model is useful
for understanding couple relationships,
particularly at important transition points
(Feeney, Ward, Noller, &amp; Hohaus, 1998).


<b><i>Communication</i></b>


Working models of attachment form as the
result of actual communications between
caregiver and child, and communication
serves as the vehicle by which attachment relationships
are negotiated from day to day
(Kobak &amp; Duemmler, 1994). Hence, individual
differences in attachment patterns should
be evident in communication with romantic
partners. This assertion has been tested widely,
especially with regard to self-disclosure and
conflict resolution.


In studying the link between attachment
and self-disclosure, researchers have used
self-report, diary, and observational methods,
and they have explored several aspects of
disclosing behavior (Feeney, Noller, &amp;
Callan, 1994; Keelan, Dion, &amp; Dion, 1998;

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I005&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Studies of romantic attachment also have
focused on conflict resolution and problem
solving (Feeney, 1994; Feeney, Noller, &amp;
Callan, 1994; Kobak &amp; Hazan, 1991; Pistole,
1989). Note that this issue was raised earlier
in this chapter with regard to stressful events
(Feeney, 1998; Simpson et al., 1996). Again,
given the range of conflict variables and attachment
measures, this research is best summarized
in tabular form. Table 14.4 shows the
destructive conflict behaviors that are associated
with insecure attachment, especially anxious-ambivalent
attachment. In conflict situations,
negative working models seem to guide
behavior in ways that tend to exacerbate conflict
and alienate partners (the very outcome
that is feared by those who are anxious about
their relationships). As would be expected,
responses to conflict are affected by the
attachment styles of both partners. It also is
important to note that insecure attachment
(relationship anxiety) predicts involvement in
negative conflict patterns both longitudinally
and concurrently (Feeney, Noller, &amp; Callan,
1994).


Given these results and the interest in <i>how</i>
attachment influences relationship outcomes,
it is not surprising that researchers have proposed
communication patterns as the underlying
mechanism. In other words, the high relationship
quality experienced by secure persons
might reflect their more effective communication.
In their longitudinal study of young married
couples, Feeney, Noller, and Callan
(1994) found little support for this mediational
model; instead, attachment and communication
exerted independent effects on
marital satisfaction. However, using a broader
sample of couples, Feeney (1994) found that
the relation between attachment security and
satisfaction was mediated by conflict patterns
for wives and was partially mediated by conflict
patterns for husbands. Finally, studying
dating couples, Keelan et al. (1998) reported
that the link between attachment and satisfaction
was mediated by facilitative disclosure (a
composite measure of self-disclosure and the
ability to elicit disclosure from others).

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I006&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<b><i>Emotional Experience and Expression</i></b>


As noted earlier, differences in attachment
style are thought to reflect experiences of regulating
emotion. Consistent with this claim,
secure attachment has been related to more
positive emotion and less negative emotion in
terms of general experiences in dating relationships
(Simpson, 1990) and problem solving
in marriage (Fuller &amp; Fincham, 1995).
Emotional responses to relationship loss also
differentiate attachment styles. Avoidant persons,
for example, report little distress over
the dissolution of dating relationships (Feeney
&amp; Noller, 1992; Simpson, 1990) but have major
problems in adapting to divorce
(Mikulincer &amp; Florian, 1998).


Recent research has explored the link between
attachment and emotion in greater
depth. Some studies have relied on individual-
level analyses, exploring the processing of
emotional memories and responses to emotion-eliciting
events (Mikulincer, 1998;
Mikulincer &amp; Orbach, 1995). Others have focused
on more specific questions such as why
dismissing persons report low distress in affect-laden
situations (e.g., Do they conceal
their distress, or are they genuinely unaffected?).
A series of studies reported by
Fraley, Davis, and Shaver (1988) have suggested
that dismissing adults generally are
able to block their emotional responses during
stressful situations but show considerable
arousal when made to focus on disturbing
thoughts. Hence, it is likely that if they are
highly invested in others, then separation or
loss will cause substantial distress.


Research also has examined the experience
and expression of specific emotions within
dyads. In a study of dating couples, insecure
attachment (low comfort with closeness, high
relationship anxiety) was related to reports of
more frequent experience of anger, sadness,
and anxiety (Feeney, 1995). Insecurity also
was linked to the tendency to control ("bottle
up" or not express) these emotions, even when
the frequency of emotional experience was
partialcd out. A study of married couples extended
this research to positive emotions
(Feeney, 1999). Again, attachment was linked
to both the experience and control of emotion.
For example, spouses high in relationship
anxiety tended not to express love, and husbands
low in comfort tended not to express
love, happiness, or pride. These patterns are
likely to have crucial implications for relationship
maintenance. In fact, both of these
studies provided evidence that emotional control
might mediate the effect of husbands'
comfort with closeness on relationship satisfaction

<b><i>Violence</i></b>


The association between attachment and
couple violence is indirectly supported by research
linking insecurity with the frequency
and intensity of negative emotion and with destructive
responses to conflict. This issue also
has been examined directly. Holtzworth-Munroe,
Stuart, and Hutchinson (1997) related
attachment insecurity (defined by various
measures) to reports of couple violence.
Similarly, Bartholomew (1997) reported high
levels of preoccupation and fearful-avoidance
among men being treated for battering their
female partners.


In a comprehensive study of attachment
and violence in community and student samples,
Roberts and Noller (1998) linked anxiety
over relationships to reports of couple violence.
This result parallels Bartholomew's
(1997) findings. Furthermore, this association
was mediated by communication patterns and
could not be explained in terms of relationship
satisfaction. Roberts and Noller (1998) also
showed interactive effects of the violent person's
anxiety over relationships and the partner's
discomfort with closeness, suggesting
that violence might be precipitated by conflicts
over issues of closeness and distance.
Longitudinal studies are needed, however, to
disentangle causal relations between attachment
style and couple violence.


<b><i>Summary of Process Research</i></b>


Important methodological advances have
been made in studying romantic attachment
including the use of partner reports (Kobak &amp;
Hazan, 1991), diary reports (Feeney, Noller,
&amp; Callan, 1994), and observations (Simpson
et al., 1996). Most findings have been robust
across gender, although there is evidence of
the importance of men's comfort with closeness
and women's anxiety over relationships.
Recent tests of mediational models help to
explain the effects of attachment characteristics
on relationship functioning, as shown in
Figure 14.1.


- <b>Attachment and Parenting</b>


Although we cannot address this issue in detail,
it is fitting that we finish our review of
research findings by noting that individual
differences in romantic attachment have implications

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086814-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In terms of romantic attachment, recent
studies have linked attachment security to
more positive attitudes to parenting. That is,
among young adult samples, more secure individuals
report greater desire to have children,
greater confidence in their ability to relate
well to young children, less endorsement
of harsh disciplinary practices, and less tendency
to be easily aggravated by children
(Rholes, Simpson, &amp; Blakely, 1995; Rholes,
Simpson, Blakely, Lanigan, &amp; Allen, 1997).
Studies of mothers of infants and young children
also have linked secure attachment to
more positive appraisals of the task of being a
mother, reports of more problem-focused
strategies in coping with parenthood tasks,
and more supportive parenting behavior in a
laboratory teaching task (Mikulincer &amp;
Florian, 1998; Rholes et al., 1995).


- <b>Practical Applications</b>


Research into romantic attachment has important
applications. At the individual level,
attachment style has implications for the way
in which people cope with stressful events.
For example, with regard to pain and illness,
anxious-ambivalence is associated with high
levels of symptom reporting and avoidance is
associated with a reluctance to seek health
care. These findings clearly are relevant to
those seeking to understand patterns of health
care use. Insecure attachment also has been
linked to various types of psychopathology in
college samples (Shaver &amp; Brennan, 1992)
and in a large representative sample of American
adults (Mickelson, Kessler, &amp; Shaver,
1997).


However, the major implications of attachment
style are for couple and family relationships.
Hence, an understanding of attachment-related
issues is important for those working
in marital and family therapy. Specific issues
that attachment principles can address include
issues of attraction and compatibility as well
as relationship conflict (both the causes of
conflict and responses to it). In addressing
these issues, it is important to consider the
combination of attachment styles represented
in a dyadic relationship. Another implication
of attachment theory is that even when attachment
insecurity causes major relationship
problems, it might be possible to revise working
models and, hence, to overcome self-defeating
patterns of thought and behavior.
Types of therapy that are best suited to this
purpose are discussed by Sperling and Lyons
(1994). These therapeutic approaches might
allow people to break the intergenerational
chain of relationship problems.
