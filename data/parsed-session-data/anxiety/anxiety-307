MY story at this juncture demands some brief account
of the Liberal Party to which I had linked my
fortunes. For—in its political manifestations anyway—it
is essentially the story of the Liberal Party during these
years.


It is no part of my duty to trace the Liberal Party back
either to its origins with Cobden and Bright, nor yet to
the start of its decline in the Asquith-Lloyd George
quarrels. The Liberal Party that I knew, though the
inheritor of long tradition, took its composite origin only
back to the early nineteen-thirties, when the group of
Liberals under Sir Herbert Samuel left the Government
as a protest against the Ottawa agreements which they
considered, not without reason, to be a breach of the
National Government's pledge in regard to tariffs.


It cannot be said that this step elicited either public
enthusiasm, or even public interest, other than amongst
the purists of Free Trade. In fact, the new Independent
Liberal Party had some difficulty in identifying itself in
the popular mind as a separate body. Amongst other
things the issue was clouded by the existence of other
bodies of Liberals: of these the Liberal Nationals under
Sir John Simon were the most important: but the small
party under Mr. Lloyd George, even though it only
consisted of the immediate family of the once-great
statesman, served to create further confusion. The
Biblical names of the leaders tended to enhance the

I have already commented on the Election of 1935 and
its sequel. The Rally at the Kingsway Hall and the
Adoption of the New Constitution in June, 1936
launched the Party on a fresh career. The first of the
series of Liberal "revivals" had started. The Liberal
Party embarked on its difficult task of establishing itself
in the eyes of the public as an independent political
force. Setting a brave face against odds, the Party
advanced against the enemy, spurred by the rhetoric of
well-worn phrases. The following (so help me God!)
is the sort of thing to which my own heart throbbed: it is
a passage which I find in the <i>Liberal Magazine</i> describing
the Assembly at Buxton in June 1937:—"pessimism
found no place at Buxton. The optimism was of a calm
realistic nature that goes forward to work with confidence
and determination."


It was as one of the obscure millions who formed
the base of the party structure that I spent my first two
years in the Liberal Party, while at the apex of the
pyramid was "The Leader"—the dapper, black-clothed
figure of Sir Archibald Sinclair—exuding charm and
affability on social occasions, glamour and inspiration
from the public platform.


However, the Bewdley by-election threw me into the
front of the fray with a prominence which I scarcely
merited. Willy-nilly, in spite of myself, as a result of
reaping 8,500 Liberal votes in this bleak wilderness I

"Congratulations on your excellent fight in a most
difficult constituency" wired Harcourt Johnstone, then
Chairman of the Party Organization.


"Do let me offer you my sincere congratulations on
your splendid fight. It is the greatest encouragement
which any Liberal candidate has given to the Party for a
long time, and we all owe you a real debt of gratitude"
wrote Sir Archibald Sinclair effusively.


The distinction lent me by the Bewdley Election
brought me wider contacts within the Party. The minor
measure of lionization to which I was subjected led to my
being elected to a place as the representative of the
Midland Regional Federation on the Liberal Party
Council. While at Woodstock, despite all my resolves to
the contrary, I found myself involved up to my ears in
politics, both with the Oxford City Liberals and also
with the members of the Oxford University Liberal
Club which had just been revived by the energy of
Frank Byers, capable and enterprising in his twenties as
he showed himself to be at a later date.


The remarkable trend towards Liberalism in the
University youth, attracted as they were by the element
of idealism not to be found in the other parties at that
time, seemed to place it beyond a peradventure that it
could only be a matter of time before the Liberal Party
inherited the political earth.


Amidst the acclaim that I received, I in my turn set

"I hope you will manage to keep the Liberals together
and to keep them actively recruiting so that you can
fight the seat with still better prospects at the General
Election" had written Sir Archibald Sinclair in his letter
to me congratulating me on the result of the Bewdley
By-election.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_7233');">[note]</a><div id="_note_7233" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ To this letter, as I look at it after the lapse of many years, I find
added the interesting rider: "though you and I and Harcourt Johnstone will
have to talk over where you fight then." A rider which, in the light of later
events, it seems that I took much too seriously.</div>


At least, as a Liberal Candidate, one was privileged to
pursue one's mission through the more pleasant country
parts of our island. One of these comprised that part of
Worcestershire, west of Severn, which then formed the
Bewdley Division. Here it was, so I felt as a result of
Sir Archibald Sinclair's injunctions, that my own lot lay.

Come with me therefore on my way north from "The
Marlborough Arms" whence, after running down the
steep lee to the bridge over the small River Glyme and
up through Old Woodstock, we drive through the
sparsely-populated farm lands of north-west Oxfordshire.
And so through undulating country to the western face of
the Cotswolds above beautiful Broadway, from where
we can see across the countryside of the Vale of Evesham
to our destination on the peculiarly feminine-shaped
Malvern Hills.


Maybe we have done this run in the twilight of a
September evening when already the plough had started
to turn over the reddish soil of the uplands after the
harvest, and we shall be meeting my agent Archie Napier,
retired Army captain with a legacy of artificial leg and
pension from World War One and we will go with him
in his Lanchester car with the specially-adapted hand-drive
to a well-attended whist drive organized by Miss
Gorle at Powick, or maybe to a village dance (patronised
by the whole village) under the aegis of Mrs. Parsons at
Callow End—those two enthusiastic ladies who set
an example of political organization in the twin
villages.


Or perhaps it is to pick up my supporter, James
Cheetham—the very image of a country evangelist with
his white hair and red face and open-necked shirt—on
the road by Malvern Link and travel with him in the high
summer to the tucked-away villages on Severnside—
Staunton, Red Marley, Severn Stoke, or Croome D'Abitot
—speaking at the crossroads, drinking in matey fashion
in the pubs, or even just knocking at the doors of tea-cosy
cottages.


Or perhaps again it is spring, when the golden-yellow
wallflowers bloom along the wide street of Broadway and
the pink apple blossom is showing in the orchards of
the Vale of Evesham. Now it is the Easter Vacation at

"There's votes in them thar' hills." It was with this
pioneering spirit that we ventured forth, confident in our
mission and its ultimate success.


"We have laid the foundations of a Liberal revival in
this part of the country" I had said in my speech on the
steps of the Country Hall, Worcester, after the announcement
of the Poll at the by-election, "I wish Captain
Conant success during his term in Parliament, but we
are going to turn him out at the end of it."


"Impossible" yelled a voice from the crowd.


We refused to believe that it was impossible.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11153');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11153" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ The result of the 1945 Election, when Gerald Sampson, my successor
as Liberal Candidate and a comparative stranger to the Division, came
within 3,170 of Captain Conant, showed it was not impossible!</div>


As we sallied forth and support came to us from
every side, there seemed every possibility that we would
crack this Tory stronghold right open.


Amongst the recruits we enlisted during one of our
tours was my friend, George Mole. This was at Clows
Top—that peculiar hot-cross-bun type of place formed
by a few houses, not to mention the two pubs, clustered
round cross roads that intersected at right angles at the
summit of the hill. It was thanks to George Mole that
Clows Top with its pub at the top of the hill and the
inimitable George Parry, its Number One "regular,"
became a bastion of our Liberal "resistance"—a resistance
that, thanks to George Mole's help, extended in influence
to the "Hop Pole" above Bewdley.

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What did this Liberalism mean that was spreading
abroad like a forest fire? To be clear about this, it must
be understood that the Liberal Party in these country
districts was still "the Labour Party of the agricultural
worker," the medium of his wish to improve his lot
without deserting traditional allegiances or subscribing
to the regimentation of the Labour Party.


In West Worcestershire, where the spreading tide of
Socialism had not yet reached, it was the primary mission
of the Liberal Party to give expression to the wave of
reformism and of protest against the low wages and the
indifferent living conditions that were still the lot of the
agricultural districts. These beautiful cottages looking
just like tea-cosies with neat gardens and roses round the
door—how many of them matched the picturesqueness
of their exterior with the amenities of modern convenience
internally? Very few indeed!


Thus it was that when I appeared on the village greens,
or in the pubs, or at their doors and said my piece, it was
usually to elicit the friendly reply: "Well, we'll see what
we can do."


"We'll see what we can do!" This was a distinct
improvement on the rather questionable "We'll think
it over," which was all I had been able to obtain up in
Lancashire!


In my elation I frequently fell into the sin, which was
that of Herod, of attributing to myself and to my own
efforts that which was, in fact the will of God expressing
Himself through social forces.

As spring went on to summer in the year 1938 and the
hills and valleys of West Worcestershire were carpeted
with white and pink blossoms it meant other things also

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My hesitations on these vital problems were many.
At times these hesitations worried me quite as much as
The Marlborough Arms Hotel worried me. But by the
spring of 1938 my opinion, as with others of the Liberal
faith, and many Conservatives also, was definite. It was
on the side of standing firmly on principle rather than
perpetual surrender to expediency.


This opinion was expressed in the clearest terms
by Mr. Anthony Eden in a statement subsequent

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"If we are to avoid catastrophe it can only be by a gigantic
and united national effort sufficient to show those nations which
still believe in power politics that force is a weapon which
cannot profit the user. But if such an effort is to be made—and
it must be made—it has to have a moral basis."


During the ensuing months the division in the nation
was clear-cut, as foreign policy came to over-shadow all
else. It was between those who advocated a stand against
aggression now and those who supported Mr. Chamberlain
(who had evidently not read the accounts of the
sufferings in the German concentration camps) in his
hopeless and feckless policy of Appeasement. This
division of opinion made strange bedfellows. On the one
side were the Labour Party, the Liberal Party spoken for
by Sir Archibald Sinclair, and that section of the Conservative
party that followed the lead of Mr. Winston
Churchill—those self-same Conservatives of Imperial
vintage whom I had encountered at the Wavertree
election. On the other was the main body of Conservatives
in Parliament who, through Party discipline, followed
Mr. Chamberlain; and, of course, the Liberal Nationals.


It was the gravest of misfortunes that, while the
appeasers had coherence under the slogan of "National
Unity," the resisters against aggression did not succeed
at any time in settling their differences on internal
policy sufficiently to form an organized political entity.
It is probable that the only person who could have
accomplished this political alchemy was Mr. Anthony
Eden following his resignation. Mr. Eden, however,
restrained by Party loyalty, decided otherwise. It is
permissible to speculate wistfully on the alternative
course events would have taken had Mr. Eden come out
into open opposition to the Chamberlain Government.

In existing circumstances, with the Labour Party dull,
uninspired, Trade-Union-dominated, with the Conservative
Opposition ineffective in the face of Party ties,
it was left to the Liberal Party as the only coherent force
to represent the best elements of the nation: in such a
manner as was acknowledged by Mr. Winston Churchill
in the House of Commons at a later date in the following
words:
<blockquote>
<p>
"I must say I think this is a fine hour in the life of the Liberal
Party, because from the moment when they realized rearmament
was necessary they have seemed to seek to bring forward together
both the material and the moral strength of this country, and I
believe that at the moment they represent what is the heart and
soul of the British nation."
</p>
</blockquote>


"I must say I think this is a fine hour in the life of the Liberal
Party, because from the moment when they realized rearmament
was necessary they have seemed to seek to bring forward together
both the material and the moral strength of this country, and I
believe that at the moment they represent what is the heart and
soul of the British nation."


The Liberal Party became, as it were, a dedicated body.
All shared this sense of dedication. None but questioned
the necessity for self-sacrifice. All, just the same, felt
equally mortified on behalf of both themselves and their
fellow-men when, as by-election followed by-election, a
conventionally-minded electorate steadfastly refused to
see the light of "principle."

In the face of this confusion and ineffectiveness there
was one person who continued his way with "a daemonic
sense of purpose": that was Adolph Hitler.


Let us return to Woodstock on an early September
evening just as the light is drawing in, and we are beginning
to think our 10.30 p.m. extra half-hour summer
extension was no longer necessary. To-night the bar of
"The Marlborough Arms" is still—still with anxiety.
Our normally talkative customers stand transfixed,
listening to the voice ranting over the wireless. It is
unintelligible ranting, apart from such a recognizable
word as "Benesh," "Benesh," "Benesh," as the coals of

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Think he means it, doctor?" The query comes from
our rubicund old friend, Councillor Tommy Robinson,
who has forgotten even to continue his anecdote about
the "roaring" horse, with which he had been regaling us
when the ranting voice started.


"I don't know," I reply, "Fairly hysterical, isn't he?
I think he's bluffing." Anxious as I am to resist aggression
I prefer to convince myself that Hitler is bluffing—that
we have only to call his bluff.


"Yes, bluffing. Must be bluffing." The echo goes
round the bar of "The Marlborough Arms" who regard
me as an oracle of political wisdom, regardless of any
precise political affiliations.


Soon after this, in the last days of September, came the
crisis of unpreparedness. For it was not safe to assume
Hitler was merely bluffing. While others elsewhere dug
trenches, or donned inefficient gas masks, or volunteered
for this and that, the '<i>elan</i> of the moment involved me in a
dash in my car to Portsmouth to enlist as a Naval Doctor.
(I had already tried unsuccessfully to join the Royal
Naval Medical Reserve when I had left practice, but at
the age of 33 years and six months I had my first experience
of being told I was "too old!") I shared the general
frustration, in addition to feeling some little surprise, at
not being immediately "embodied"—at merely having
my name taken and being told I would be notified
later. I was then a stranger to Service administration!


Back in Woodstock the days of anxious waiting
continued through the Conferences at Berchtesgarten—
Godesberg—then Munich.


But, throughout the strain, life went on as usual. On
the night of Friday, September 30th, we were enjoying

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Few will be able" writes Professor Namier in reference
to the statesmen of that era in his <i>Europe in Decay</i> "to
re-live those transactions without distress, or even shame."


Maybe this will be also to some degree be the case
with those who supported these statesmen.


Cheer after cheer resounded through the Bury Barns
Dance Hall. Hurrah! Hurrah! Good old Chamberlain!
It was Peace! Men and women were standing on chairs
to drink to Peace in Our Time. Peace for Some Time
anyway. For time enough for us to go on enjoying our
pleasant, easy-going lives, our dances and our point-to-points,
Ascot, Wimbledon, all the other grand things
that made life worth living, for a little longer. Whoever
said otherwise was a traitor to National Unity, a warmonger,
a Red. As for Churchill—old Winston was a
bit peculiar, entering his dotage, many said. Chamberlain
was the man who knew how to deal with Hitler.


"Come along, drink to Chamberlain, damn you!"


Far be it from me to embarrass my good friends either
by mentioning names or even by reminding them further
of what they said that evening.


At least, as I re-live in my thoughts that particular
occasion, I can claim to be the only person at our table, the
only person in the room, so it seemed, who did not
drink to Chamberlain, who did not share the sanguine
hopes of the remainder of this merry gathering.
