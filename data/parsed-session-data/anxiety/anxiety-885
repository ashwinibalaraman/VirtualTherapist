BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I got up nice and early today and got to Rehab on time for my appointment for tomorrow which was kind of, I don't know. It was one of those things like I took the wrong bus and I still made it. And then I'm like oh, okay.
THERAPIST: Where is it?
CLIENT: It's not that far. It's just like I was taking a bus I never take and yeah. Fortunately a very kind driver let me basically flag him down the street, which was great. So my [inaudible [00:00:52] been go to rehab, you go to physical therapy, call my mom to tell her I'm not coming home for Thanksgiving, come here. So I did call my mom.
THERAPIST: You did?
CLIENT: I did. It was weirdly okay, sort of. Weird that she didn't really freak out, which was really weird. Like in the past, like any time I've sort of vaguely hinted or said well maybe I was thinking of not, she's just flipped her shed, for days. And so when I told her...well I started by telling her I was having hip and leg problems. And she insisted I had never mentioned before, which isn't true, but whatever. And first she sounded kind of mad; like that I hadn't told her about my hip and leg pain. And then I explained like, you know, why I wasn't going to be traveling, and then she also sent a really mad bad...she sounded just kind of mad for a little while. Like mad that I was having pain.
[00:02:27]
THERAPIST: Right. Like what the hell are you doing hurting like that? 
CLIENT: And I told her about how like I've had this problem where, because of the swelling, I get swelling in my hip if I fly and so I can't, I need a wheel chair at the gate when I get off, not when I get on. 
THERAPIST: And she's [inaudible [00:02:44] you've already flown.
CLIENT: Yeah, and she's like, "That's terrible." Okay, I'm sorry. Yes, it is terrible mom. So but she accepted it and didn't like tell me I was wrong. She also didn't try to convince me that she could drive down and pick me up. Or really anything. So I still don't believe it. Like I don't...and then she told me a funny story, actually. Like I didn't have to like get real keyed up for this conversation to be really horrible; like it was just as much about fibroids and I just...I don't know. Like I kind of feel like it didn't really happen. 
THERAPIST: Right. Sort of [inaudible [00:03:58].
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Like last night I had a horrible time falling asleep. I was super anxious like all day. [Pause]. And just like I don't know; I was just kind of a nervous wreck all weekend mostly. I was just thinking I don't want [inaudible [00:04:25] talk to my mom about this. I was talking about it with a friend and she's like you kind of have to do that soon because it's already [inaudible [00:04:34]. Like I just don't want to and now I just, I don't know. Like I'm still feeling kind of anxious and worried. I guess because of all that buildup and how she's reacted in the past. And I'm like is she mellowing? Is this just an atypical moment? Like I don't know. [Pause].
[00:05:17] 
What I didn't tell her I was taking [inaudible [00:05:47]. I think I only have to one. 
THERAPIST: Why [inaudible [00:05:53]?
CLIENT: Yeah, well because I called her at like 11:00 and she's like oh, you're at work. I'm like yes. That's so true mom. [Pause]. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And by the way.
CLIENT: And by the way. Yeah, I would've tried that being [inaudible [00:06:12] all weekend. [inaudible [00:06:15]. She actually said we're going to the...so have you bought your Thanksgiving ticket, which is perfect. 
THERAPIST: Right. Could say no. [Pause.]
CLIENT: I don't know; it also...I'm kind of...like I really feel like my; I feel like I'm second guessing myself now. Like [pause]...like was I being paranoid for thinking, for being so like stressed and antsy about this. Like... [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I follow what you're saying. I sort of think so, but that I didn't know what it means. 
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think I was being overreacting about it, but I don't know. Like right now she's so chilled that I really feel like...it's weird; it's kind of like all the stress and craziness that she was causing me, like when I was having fibroid pain and surgery, it's now like that didn't happen. And she's just like, "Oh sure, whatever." You can have illnesses and I won't put up... [Pause.] And she also did not engage in a typical...what you think [inaudible [00:07:59] in a good mood, but, she didn't ask me how my moods were doing, which was very exciting also. 
[00:08:07]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: This time of year, that's usually when she starts. Usually, it's like right around Thanksgiving. [Pause.] In some ways that was sort of my mom's interrogating about like how do I feel, [inaudible 08:29] Bipolar. Am I manic? Am I depressed? I think that ... [pause]...it's almost like the big reason behind me...behind my dread of going. [Pause.] Because like I really don't feel like I'm doing really well emotionally. I feel really depressed and upset and like when mom gets a hint of that, she really really wants to talk to me about it. And one of the things that she likes to do is to she has to plan a family group event, group thing and if I don't, if I don't want to go or I'm not sufficiently excited, but not too excited about it, she just starts being...gets really upset. And not like not going isn't really an option. 
We had a huge fight one year. It was when Dreamgirls came out and she wanted everyone to go see it, and I didn't feel like going to see a movie. And so we had a like a multi-hour argument about it in which I refused to go. And then when they came back after the movie, my mom continued to have an argument about it. And the next day we had an argument about it. And then I think, one more time... [Pause]...probably why she was upset she's like well I thought you liked the movie. It's not that I don't like the movie; I just don't want to see a movie. And then there was this, but you know, we were doing it all together and I picked it out special. I just sort of...but why didn't you just go. [Pause.] Yeah. It was kind of; it was one of the...I almost think it was one of the biggest arguments I've had with my mom. But... [Pause], I was surprised that she was that upset about like a movie or me not wanting to go see a movie. 
THERAPIST: Yes, it sounds like this can be a little crazy making with her. Where on one side there are instances like that where it seems way over the top. And then there are things like earlier this morning when there's no reaction. And I think you bring up the other instance as partly to remind yourself that you're not that crazy, because look; what happened this other time? Yeah, a bunch of these other times. Yeah, so you're not making shit up to have been nervous over the weekend of how it would go. But either way, it sounds a bit crazy making.
CLIENT: It is. I mean because it's just; to me it was I just like, yeah; it's like I'm going like yeah, like you just had a really great reaction mom, sort of and that was good, but what about the times when you completely lost your mind over this? And yeah, it makes me feel like; it just always seems like, "Did that really happen?" Was she really that crazy? She wasn't except that I know she was and it's just like, I don't know; like I feel bad for not wanting to tell my mom things. I feel guilty. And then even though if I have a lot of reasons why I didn't tell her, the fact that she didn't completely flip out this one time makes me think like oh, well maybe; maybe it will be okay if I discussed other things with her. Except I still don't think so. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: I guess one of the effects of this is it really makes you question your credibility. Sort of, yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, it makes me like; it just makes me, yeah; it makes me question like all, like my credibility and like [pause]...am I making good choices? Am I not? It's just like I don't know. I guess it also makes you think I feel like I'm...now I might be crazy or actually freaking out one. And the relationship as opposed to my mom. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
[00:13:57]
CLIENT: I mean it's also like I can't; it's like the inability to go talk to her about it because she never feels like she ever freak out. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, it seems to me like that's inherently part of the crazy making quality of this is that... [Pause]...there can be no like Meta discussion.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Yeah. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: It's just [inaudible 14:35].
CLIENT: It is. [Pause.] I mean the other thing we should also makes me think about is I often, like sometimes, it wasn't this conversation, but a couple of weekends ago I was talking with someone and I was saying something about my mom, a kind of amusing story. One of my friends was like, "I'm pretty sure I'm going to turn in to your mom when I grow up," in a slightly weird crazy mom way. And I'm like yeah, I mean, yes, but no. Like I feel like I do think that she was a lot less; I feel like she was less controlling and driving me crazy when I was a kid. And so I'm like when I was a kid; I don't know. I only remember things from being like 8. But [pause]...sometimes it's hard for me to sort of like remember my mom being like really cool or really calm about something or not freaking out. And now have her freaking out a lot about things. 
[00:16:14]
And like even like; I mean obviously like we had problems when I was a kid, I was a teenager, but I don't know. The intensity of the arguments has changed. And [pause]...like in a way I feel like she's, in some ways, is more controlling of my behavior now or wants to be than when I was younger. 
THERAPIST: Right. [Pause.]
CLIENT: And also more insistent that however she feels is like totally the obviously right, correct, thing. 
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pause.] That as well as you want to be.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] Which is, yeah. [Pause.] I mean I kind of think it might be related to my brother having a bunch of serious health problems.
THERAPIST: Funny, I was just thinking the exact same thing.
CLIENT: Yeah. I also realize one of the things that I am mad at my mom about, which is not entirely related to my brother, but like when she's constantly freaking out about me being Bipolar, and am I manic, and am I depressed. I used to, well, you know mom, not that this is ever anybody's fault really, but you know, one like I finished school on time. I have never disappeared for multiple days across country. I've never been forcibly institutionalized. I've never, you know, like lots of things. [Pause.] And...[pause]...I guess it's not that I want like credit for that exactly, but I feel like my mom, the way my mom acts it's as if, in some ways, I've had worse problems than Seth has. And I didn't have it, but [pause]...her actions very much are that way. [Pause.] Which, I mean, I don't know. Like [pause]...I guess I feel like I don't understand why...[pause]...she acts as if I'm about to have like at any second, I'm having like, will be having major mental health crisis or have had or like I'm about to and that she needs to intervene when that's not happening. 
THERAPIST: Right and it has not ever. 
CLIENT: Yeah... [Pause]. Like you know, [inaudible [00:20:12] I've always kind of just been like well I'm just going to keep on doing whatever and get through whatever.
THERAPIST: Well you never have been hospitalized. I mean I don't think you've ever been close.
CLIENT: No. 
THERAPIST: At times you've felt pretty low and some of the stuff with college with the guy who was having a breakdown, that was very stressful for you, but you were never even close.
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] I know. I guess that's kind of—I don't want to say I'm the better child for that, but I'm like look; in terms of which of your children is more likely to have, need hospitalization, I'm not that person. It's just not me. It shouldn't...it's just how it's...
THERAPIST: Well I mean you're feeling that reflects something a bit sort of...I don't think pejorative is the right word, but [pause]...it's something that—I don't know if that's the right word for it—but it's like de-valuing, belittling of your own [inaudible 21:37]. 
CLIENT: Yeah. She's also very weird about...that I go to a therapist. Like because both she and my dad are like that's a totally weird thing that we would never do. Why would you do that? Oh, but Karen you should see a therapist. Okay guys, what the fuck. And right I brought this up to my brother and he said I want to see a therapist in ER, but his insurance is being really frustrating; he's having a hard time seeing a psychiatrist. So [pause]...but yeah, it's just; I mean I think what my mom really wants is for there to be a medication I could take that would fix everything. Like or like three medications that I take or whatever. Like in a certain way she's like why can't you be more like your brother where you just have to take an antipsychotic and...I don't want to though. 
THERAPIST: No, I guess I was smiling because it just sounds like such a clear flick where she acknowledges no issues, no anxiety, never any [inaudible 23:35] problem. Nothing. But is constantly worrying about that stuff with you. Like not in herself, but always worrying about that stuff with you. The thought of having problems I...hmm...yeah, I think that if she were to take something for anxiety that would probably make you a lot better.
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: In her mind.
CLIENT: Oh God yes. 
THERAPIST: But that's medication for all the things that yeah...
CLIENT: Only she would...when she drinks; when she allows herself to have like an extra glass of wine or two at dinner, I'm like everything's better. You know, I'm magically better. My dad's blood pressure wasn't as bad. Like it's great. Yeah. [Pause.] 
[00:24:40]
I was talking to my, Ashby, my roommate, Ashby and I; Ashby was up at my mom's and my mom's freaking out over not being able to drive in the snow when I was having surgery. And she says like, "So, your mom can't drive in the snow?" I'm like, "No. My mom can't drive in the snow only if she's freaked out about me. Every other time she can drive."
THERAPIST: Yeah, what I remember, which just seems so clear at the time, was she couldn't take her car to follow you to the hospital. The thing I remember was not the snow; although I'm doubting you, it was that the car was going to break down or the car was going to fall apart on her way in to the hospital for your surgery. 
CLIENT: Yes, which is why she couldn't pick me up. Yeah, because I knew she was going to pick me up and drive me there. 
THERAPIST: Yeah, and all the way back to and from like up in New York. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But it couldn't make it to the hospital for your surgery. 
CLIENT: Yeah, and then also mom, didn't you grow up in Finland? You've lived in the cold. 
THERAPIST: Which also has snow up there.
CLIENT: Right, in upstate New York. 
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: She regularly bugs people for like they can't drive in storms, and I'm just like...Yeah, it was ... [pause]...I mean there are sort of two things. One was that she's like I just can't; it's impossible for me to drive because everything horrible will happen. And I'm just like, but this is literally the one thing I wanted you to do. But also she was very insistent that I need to get myself to the hospital some other way which...[pause]...it's just like; it just doesn't make any sense. Like if you can't drive, public transit works. 
THERAPIST: Right, yeah. Well logically, it doesn't make any sense.
CLIENT: Yeah. 
[00:26:57]
And I know that like that's now how that works. And Ashby remembers that like my mom and her friends showed up, I think, after we had already gone in to surgery. And then my mom was like I have to go get something to eat, and disappeared. And so the surgeon never talked to my mom. He talked to Ashby twice. And which Ashby was not expecting and I didn't expect my mom to disappear either because...[pause] because usually, she's really you know, has been very present like during my dad having problems or like even me like for when I was going to the dentist like for my crowns or a few other things. Like right after college. And she said, okay, I'll drive you to the dentist. Or she's like, I made you an appointment. Okay. And then suddenly she just wasn't there and has like a bazillion reasons why she wasn't; that were totally new, irrational, and nothing to do with her being anxious or upset. [Pause.]
And she also stood...she's also super defensive about it. A couple of times I kind of like mentioned like, oh yeah; [inaudible 28:44]. She just gets very like...well you don't understand because you don't drive...dah dah dah dah. I don't know mom. You really...and my brother was really surprised when I told him about that the first time. 
THERAPIST: Well, I think that the part about this that' really pernicious through you is that pause]...you sort of, and kind of in some sort of way, take on a lot of the anxiety that she's handing over. Like with calling her about Thanksgiving, I think. You mean in some literal sense like there is no way anything like truly damaging or like anything horrible was going to go down as far as I can tell. You know, I mean maybe she'd be really mad; maybe you'd get in to a fight, but at least I never. And that would be bad; I'm not trying to sugar coat it or ignore that.
CLIENT: She was going to disown me for a while. 
THERAPIST: But you were terrified all weekend. And I guess I imagine there's a way that you're like taking on some of the anxiety that she feels about being distant from you or something like that. [Pause.]
[00:30:29]
CLIENT: One of my friends had said that you know one of the things I need to think about was, she put it like my desire to act perfectly. Like I really want to have this like the perfect interaction that would have her not freak out, me not freak out. And so yeah; like I end up making myself super responsible for how she feels. And just really...
THERAPIST: So funny, I guess I created like a double entendre. When I took you to like explicitly mean was you feel responsible; you had [inaudible 31:31] for how she feels in the sense of having to manage the interaction in such a way that she comes out of it feeling as good as possible. But the other way I heard it was all the stuff she's struggling with, you take on. You take responsibility for how she feels, you know, the same way that it's, let me clean this up; she had back problems. But you felt like, oh mom, let me come and I'll figure it out and I'll do this or that and work it all out. And then...like that. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah, and I mean I think I more feel like the; like it's more my responsibility to mesh co-anxieties like I should be the one fixing them or something.
THERAPIST: Right, but I think what having the hardest is the second one. 
CLIENT: That's what I was trying to say.
THERAPIST: Oh okay. Yeah.
[00:32:37]
CLIENT: The second one is what I feel like. I keep on trying to do, or think I should be doing... [Pause.]
THERAPIST: Why do you do that? I think you love her and care about her and like have an agreement with her about you bearing these things for her. [Pause].
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause.] 
THERAPIST: Or you get really worried that you're crazier than you think and she's right. Or [pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean other things like I do worry a lot about hurting her feelings because wow; my mom is like, can we [inaudible 33:38] from them? Like when she admits her feelings are hurt, they're hurt for like three years. And [pause]...like I do carry a grudge for a lot of things, but not like it seems to actively bother her for a big chunk of time. 
Like one time I think it was at College. She was helping me move. I was really frustrated with her, so I basically lied and said I was going to go do something. She said, oh, let's have dinner and I'll drive home. I was like, "No, I can't have dinner with you mom, I have to do something else." And like later on I said something or different that made it pretty clear that I lied and that really upset her for a couple of years. She would bring it up and talk about she was really hurt that I didn't want to have dinner with her; that it was sort of everything. She was hurt that I didn't want to have dinner with her. She was upset that I had lied to her. She was upset that she found out that I lied. Like yeah, it was kind of everything. And every time we tried to talk about it, she was still super upset like it had just happened.
THERAPIST: Is there something that's like a bit like kind of fragile in her? I know she can be very strong willed and have a lot of conviction in a lot of ways. But is there; it sounds like you're describing something also that is kind of fragile about her.
[00:35:09]
CLIENT: I think she's really concerned about, I guess, us being like a family. Like I mean I think part of her obsession is like doing group activities over holidays is that she wants to make sure that like we're all a happy family and we all get along. [Pause.] And like in some ways the physical presence really matters. So if Seth was living somewhere and he couldn't come for Thanksgiving, even though he would call or whatever, like it was really clear my mom missed him like actually being there. [Pause.] And so then at like Christmas or the holidays like it's very; it gets super important that we're all in the same room [inaudible 36:27] for different time period or that everyone comes down to dinner at the same time and like. You know if we're having like leftovers for lunch, I'm kind of like whatever. Everyone will be at the table at some point. But she's really anxious about it and then if and then what drives myself and my brother and his wife all crazy is she'll ask my brother like questions that are actually about Ashby. So she'll ask him like well you know how it will take for Ashby to finish that? He's like, you should ask her. Or you know, what does she want to eat? You should ask her? 
THERAPIST: Do you think Ashby would like some more peas?
CLIENT: Yeah and we're just like, I don't know. Ask Ashby. Like she's right...she's in the house. Or this can wait long enough for her to find out. And it's, to me, the most weird and sexist thing she does. Because I'm like, why would the husband magically just know all these things? Like where are we going with this? And I really like, I don't understand it at all. Like... [Pause]...because she will talk to Ashby a lot. But for some reason, like there are things that she will just ask my brother. Then she'll do this when Ashby is sitting there, which is even weirder. If she's like there, but say like talking to someone else, she'll ask like well, a question that is actually for Ashby. [Pause.] It makes me super...like I just have a horrible reaction to it. 
THERAPIST: I mean I can imagine the things...it sounds pretty clearly it sounds to you like a gender thing. Like it...I mean as opposed to it being like for some whatever reason she's more comfortable asking her child than her son's spouse. Or...
CLIENT: Yeah, to me, it kind of feels like weirdly gendered. And also like now that they're married, they're a single unit.
THERAPIST: I see. 
CLIENT: I guess that's part of it. Like they've become one person. I'm like it's horrible. And yeah, it does feel like this weird like she's not Ashby, she's Mrs. Seth [inaudible]. Like which is creepy. And but also really like my mom answers for my dad all the time sometimes like...why don't you ask Ashby all the questions. Like there's just a lot of...
THERAPIST: Does it have anything to do with Seth and Ashby's relationship?
CLIENT: No. 
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: No like they're both have independent opinions on things.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And are totally capable of vocalizing that.
THERAPIST: Right. I guess I hadn't had the sense that there was like a replication of some of that kind of stuff from your parent's relationship with theirs; with Seth being in the role of your mother answering for your father somehow. 
CLIENT: Yeah, no. I mean it's weird. We all think it's weird. Yeah, because they aren't one of those couples who like answers for each other or does like that in like she didn't take his name which is fine. Yeah, I don't know like...[pause]...I think part of my reaction is I just always feel like, to me, it feels like Ashby is not this independent human being who is married to my brother. It's like she became an appendage of my brother in some weird way. And that is always upsetting. And also like, honestly, the only other time I see people do that is when they're really invested in this weird like sexist man runs the house thing, which I don't think my mom is invested in, but that's...
THERAPIST: I mean I guess [inaudible [00:41:11] your mom and like I don't want to come across like I'm trying to sort of doubt whatever sexism is involved in this, but when you made the appendage metaphor, it sounds a little like how she can be with you sometimes.
CLIENT: How so?
THERAPIST: She knows what you're feeling, she knows what you need, she knows what you're thinking, and she knows what you're worried about. She certainly knows what you should do.
CLIENT: Oh yeah. I hadn't thought about that. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: They may both occur at once, you know. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But I guess I was wondering if that; it would probably bug you a lot in any case, but I wonder that if that sort of adds some fuel to it, you know.
CLIENT: I think it does. Also, I think part of it is also like it makes me feel like is his how my mom thinks like relationships just work. 
THERAPIST: Right. Kind of [inaudible 42:13].
CLIENT: Yeah. [Pause]. Which is, I don't know; it makes me feel uncomfortable in a wide variety of ways including my like... How is my parent's relationship working? Like, I don't know. It just...everything...the idea of someone asking my partner questions for me when I was there, I just; it makes me feel really horrified. I don't know. It feels like this weird like merger being like no boundaries, no separation. You're just...and I would never want to have that relationship. And I don't know. It feels a little bit like my mom is kind of, I guess, superimposing that on my brother and his wife's actual relationship almost as if she thinks that's the way that it should be. Because the way she does it so like, well it's [inaudible 43:27], why wouldn't I ask you about your wife's [inaudible 43:37]. Like I don't know. [Pause.] 
THERAPIST: I guess there's like a little whiff of that in the way she treats the two of them, right. Like it's not possible; like she doesn't imagine that could be a difference, would have anything from the way she thinks that it should be. [Pause.]
CLIENT: Yeah, I may still think that it's easier for me to be, you know, upset and outraged on Ashby's behalf than on my own behalf. [Pause.]
THERAPIST: We should end up for now.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But we'll talk more tomorrow. [Pause.] I'll see you.
