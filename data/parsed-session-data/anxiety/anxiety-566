<font size="5"><b>9: Back Ward</b></font>

"<i>O</i>h she's back again. We knew she couldn't
make it!" That's what I expect to hear from the staff on my
return to the Castle. In deciding to come back I anticipate the
cynicism of the staff and their disappointment when patients
go into crisis or fail to achieve their goals--and I don't want
to confront those attitudes. But, I'm surprised. Actually the
staff on B-1 is quite pleased that I've managed to stay outside
for four years. Several of the nurses who were there during
my earlier admissions even welcome me back, like an old-timer,
making me feel as if I've come back to friends.


They explain that B-1 has changed since my last discharge.
It's now used for admissions and for the younger
patients, who are coming to the Castle in far greater numbers.
B-1 is no longer filled with incontinent, half-naked
old ladies, who are now being housed in their own ward.
B-1 looks better--there's a fresh coat of yellow paint and
more furniture around. And it feels better--the younger
patients are more lively and able to carry on a conversation.
It's really nice to see the familiar faces of some of the
more helpful staff, though there are also many new staff as
well. I'm at home soon after arriving.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm feeling pretty good, especially since the anxiety and
turmoil which has recently flooded my life seems behind
me now. There's another surprise--the dreaded shock
treatments, as well as the hot tubs and insulin therapies, are
no more. Just thinking about those shock treatments--
which I try not to do--makes me shiver and sweat, and
feel dizzy. When I hear that they're no longer used, I'm
even more sure that I've come back to the right place.


But the admission process scares me this time in a new
and different way. I know the routine; that doesn't bother
me. But something ominous is happening.


"Tell me what you've been doing since your last admission."
The admitting attendant's question is matter-of-fact
and predictable. But where other times on admission my
answers were brief or nonexistent, this time, I want to say
a lot. I talk about Pa and Ma's deaths, and all the terrible
emotions I experienced from them. I really work at
explaining how I feel, saying over and over that I've never
been so scared in my life as I describe being overwhelmed
by frightening distortions and the racing, whirling jumble
of my mind.


The attendant looks at me while I talk and doesn't interrupt.
She looks at me and listens, but I know she's not
grasping what I'm saying. That frightens me even more. I
desperately want her to realize that things are not the same
as before. I'm not just a lost, confused, and depressed
youngster, as I had been on my last admission. Now I'm
trying to cope with something far different, a real mental
sickness, and I need help very badly. Though the intensity
of the recent emotional turmoil has receded, it's still
seething inside me, ready to bust out. I want help, but at
the same time I don't want to get so well that I might have

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remain in the Castle this time for eight years. For the
first six years I do nothing really to help myself. Though I
manage to get my high school diploma, I accomplish little
else that's positive. Often my energy is directed, still like a
rebellious teenager, toward breaking the hospital rules;
that always lands me in trouble. Too often I just avoid any
kind of potentially helpful contact, drifting instead into my
own troubled thoughts and feelings, eventually beginning
a downhill slide that accelerates into an inescapable struggle
with overpowering delusions and hallucinations.


I think part of the reason I do nothing is precisely because
I'm so comfortable in the Castle. In a way different
from all the other places in which I've lived, the Castle is
my home, the staff and patients, my family. I've become a
child who belongs there and with them. Though twenty-nine
at the time of this latest admission, I have the maturity
of a young teenager. My appearance hasn't changed since
the earlier admissions--I'm still small and slight of build,
weighing only one hundred and two pounds. The dungarees
and shirts that I wear most of the time reinforce my
image as a youngster. Staff treats me like a child; it's the
easiest thing for them to do. And I want to be a child, to be
taken care of, so I act like a child, sometimes intentionally.


Lying in bed that first night, I think of how good it is to
be back. I'm safe. Now I can relax. The evening nurse tells
me that Miss Wendall has become the head nurse on B-1.
"We all really like that woman," she remarks. I remember
Miss Wendall from my prior admissions. "She's certainly
a good person," I recall fondly, "and very friendly to me."
I try unsuccessfully to "puff up" my pillow, noticing that

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Rise and shine, ladies! Rise and shine, this ain't no
vacation home!" The loud shouts of the nurses penetrate
into my sleep and the bright ward lights flash on, making
it hard to adjust my opening eyes to the room. Morning
has come to the ward. I look around. Still sleepy women
are getting up from their beds and dressing. I open my eyes
wider, finally emerging from sleep, and continue to watch
the scene.


"Marie, you slept really well last night. How do you
feel?" One of the night nurses is talking to me as she's on
her way out of the ward to go off" her shift.


I don't respond. I remain in bed, waiting for someone to
tell me to get up, but nothing is said. It's eerie. I keep
waiting for someone or something, but I don't know who
or what. And to make matters worse, a change has come
over me since the night but I can't understand what it is.
About thirty minutes later, a nurse shouts that it's smoking
time. Smoking is now done in the sunporch. I grab a pack
of cigarettes which I've hidden under my pillow and try to
get up from my bed ... but my body feels heavy, too
heavy to move.


Several minutes pass. Finally, after a major effort, I'm
able to rise from the bed. I place my feet solidly on the

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Miss Wendall is one of the few forces that keeps pulling
me toward life and hope. She's probably the most dedicated
person I ever encounter at the Castle. Capable and
self-assured, she's well respected by other staff who appreciate
her genuine concern for patients. With her, everything
always seems "in control." She's got a strong,
serious personality which makes it hard to contradict her,
but she really cares for us and isn't authoritarian. Miss
Wendall comes on duty at seven in the morning, and, as
she does every morning, carefully checks on each of the
patients, writing down notes in their records. Now that
she's finished her rounds and is sitting at her desk, I watch
her. I'm too tired to go over to her, even to say hello ...
and I'm still too afraid to move about because my body
feels heavy. But as I watch Miss Wendall, I feel better.


It takes a while before I realize how important Miss
Wendall is to me. I'm deeply attached to her. She's the
mother I never really had. Miss Wendall has faith in me,

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tranquilizers are just beginning to be used in the Castle,
but I fight them, refusing to take them, struggling against
their effects. Miss Wendall firmly believes in these new
drugs and the antipsychotic drugs that have come into use.
They're for her what they're intended to be--"wonder"
drugs that can control mental illness. At different times
Miss Wendall, usually with the assistance of several other
nurses, has to force medication down my throat or into me
with injections. But Miss Wendall gives the drugs to me
with the conviction they'll make me better. One time, after
a course of drugs is forced on me, I notice that the medication
helps, calming me down. But as soon as I feel better,
I start on a rampage, marching into the sunporch, throwing
over all the chairs. Immediately, nurses are running into
the porch and grab me. I fight back, kicking, punching,
screaming out swears; but they're too many and too strong,
and they shove me into the seclusion room. After a while,
with me still screaming, they come into the room, and
holding me down, give me a shot. Gradually, I drift off to
sleep. The battle over medication is repeated many times--
the outcome, being forced to take the drugs and usually
spending some time in seclusion, is a foregone conclusion.

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eating is another battleground. Often I refuse to eat. I'm
losing weight rapidly and in order to prevent my becoming
debilitated, they force-feed me. One day Miss Wendall
is trying to spoon feed me. Grimacing, I make it extremely
hard for her to open my mouth. Then suddenly I've had
enough. I push the spoon back at her, spilling the dark
green pea soup over her clean white uniform. It looks
disgusting and I turn away. I feel sick--I've just hurt the
one person I can depend on. I've done it again ... I'll be
lost forever. Soon thereafter, Miss Wendall, along with
three other attendants, forcibly leads me up a long flight of
stairs and approaches the door to A-2. As we get closer to
that back ward, my body goes limp and they have to drag
me the rest of the way, into A-2 itself. I'm once again in the
back ward of the Castle. I beg Miss Wendall to let me go
back to B-1, grasping onto her uniform, blurting out my
words with a sobbing voice. But it's useless. And so are
my pleas in the subsequent days to the staff on A-2.


Miss Wendall feels I need A-2 because I've become
uncontrollable. She's trying to help and at the same time
believes I need some punishment or at least some disciplinary
action. For me A-2 is only a punishment--and a
punishment with its own unmatched cruelty. A-2 takes
away my life. All I can breathe is the dead air of the lifeless
patients, whose humanity has been almost totally robbed
from them.


When I do leave A-2, I don't return to B-1; I'm taken to
B-2 instead. B-2 is on a floor above B-1 and though it's not
officially a back ward, it's certainly not as nice as B-1.
There are more chronic patients there and many more
restrictions. I remain on B-2 for approximately a year. At
that point, Miss Wendall and the doctor in charge of the
female patients determine that I'm a lot sicker than appears

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A change has come over me by the time I return to B-1.
Not only am I unable to communicate, but my head feels
hollow and inside of it a voice speaks out. It's a real voice
that speaks loudly and sharply. It belongs to "Ma." Over
and over again it says, "Marie, die! ... Marie, die! ...
Marie die!" I spend most of my time sitting in a chair off
the alcove listening to this voice, believing that Ma wants
me to die but not knowing whether I should kill myself or
whether I should defy Ma and keep on living. For hours at
a time I'm immobilized with this terrible conflict, afraid to
move, fearing any move will precipitate a decision.


At this time, a new woman doctor comes to the Castle.
Dr. Baylor is a tall, older woman who's thoroughly dedicated
to her work. Especially kind to patients, she's also
respected by the staff. Though Dr. Baylor dresses conservatively,
and her voice is firm, she's very friendly. The
patients in the ward wait by the door for an hour or more
for her arrival at morning rounds. When she comes she's
barraged by patients, each asking for her attention and
help--and she's always willing to listen. As she walks
through the ward on her rounds, she's followed by a group
of patients, still talking with her or just accompanying her.
You never get from Dr. Baylor that punitive or rigid
response which so many other staff show. As soon as she
arrives, she takes an interest in me--that interest grows,
becomes reciprocal, and begins to deepen into a real caring.


I still haven't told anyone that Ma's speaking to me but
Miss Wendall suspects that I'm hearing something. Every
once in a while, as I sit in the chair, my face tightens up, my
lips mumble silent words, and my head shakes in protest.

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Can't I tell someone about Ma's visits? I want support to
resist her orders, and reassurance that I can disobey her. I
don't want to kill myself, but I can't escape from that
threat. Miss Wendall tries to reach out to me, but I'm afraid
to tell her, afraid Ma will punish me. There's also another
nurse, Mrs. Wolfson, whom I trust and wish to tell everything,
but she's also unable to reach me. She makes many
attempts to help but I continue to sit--entrapped by Ma's
voice--from early morning until it's time to go to bed after
supper. It's not until one day after Mrs. Wolfson stops
working at the Castle that I approach Miss Wendall for the
first time about Ma's commands.


"Miss Wendall ... there's something wrong ... real
wrong. I'm hearing things and it's bad ... bad things. Ma
keeps telling me to die ... she wants me to die. I don't
want to die ... but what can I do, she wants me to die....
And she doesn't leave me alone!"


It's very difficult to speak to Miss Wendall about Ma, and
my words sometimes trail off into silence, as I avert my
gaze. I'm frightened to tell her about Ma's voice because it
shows that I'm sick and I'm afraid I won't get well.


Miss Wendall immediately sits me down at her desk so
we can talk. Her words are soothing--I feel held and comforted.
Then, she calls Dr. Baylor who orders a new medication
for me. Having opened up enough to talk to Miss
Wendall, I feel better. I'm just glad that she and Dr. Baylor
know what's going on in my head. Ma's voice comes to
me less frequently, and sometimes when it does, I sit with
Miss Wendall, holding her hand. That helps. Eventually,
Ma's voice will leave me.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite the fact that my life at the Castle is now chaotic
and filled with anxiety most of the time, I never totally lose
my ability to see myself and evaluate my condition--even
if that vision is at times very weak and obscured. There are
periods of lucidity when I realize how far things have deteriorated
and how terrorized I become when Ma's voice
speaks to me. This lucidity makes the situation even more
painful as I can't really believe all this anxiety and "craziness"
is happening to me.


But there's also relief from my suffering, and within the
Castle, there are times of fun. I especially enjoy the companionship
of the many patients now on B-1 who are age
mates. We form a group, and while we can intensify each
others' anxieties, we can also feed each others' healthy side
by sharing good times. There are evenings when we sit
by the old piano, as one of the patients plays songs and
we all join in, singing at the top of our voices. During these
moments I feel close to other people, and I'm happy because
I'm part of the group, accepted by others.


There are other times when we relax, keeping each other
company, enjoying a good laugh. It's really good therapy.
These times keep me going when so much else is bringing
me down, sapping my strength and hope.


Betty Morrison, a volunteer at the Castle, is also part of
our group. It's great to see her coming onto the ward.
She's always doing something to brighten our lives! She
brings food--the kind we like, subs and stuff--and sometimes
there's so much, she hauls it in on a wheelchair, or
even on a stretcher! Betty's someone you can talk with. We
become special friends and our talks become a really
important part of my life. Being around Betty helps me
feel normal. Every so often she invites some of us to visit

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I've also become friendly with Dr. Baylor now. She
invites me to visit her home on the hospital grounds.
Soon I'm a more regular guest, sometimes eating meals
with her and her family, sometimes, when I'm feeling
better, baby-sitting for her grandchildren. Babysitting is
special--Dr. Baylor's confidence in me to do that means
a lot. Dr. Baylor also arranges for me to clean her house
periodically. All these times I spend at her place are important.
It gets me out of the ward, away from its restrictions,
and into a place that makes me feel needed and
good--her house has nice soft furniture and plants in every
window.


One day I'm asked to go down to clean Dr. Baylor's
house--and to make matters even better, I can go with my
friend Rose.


Rose and I are about the same age, in our early thirties.
She's only five feet and, though quite stocky, has a very
pretty face. We both could have been labeled "crazy"--and
we are by the insensitive staff. But we're really just two
good friends, suffering from the distress of mental illness,
while still sharing our lives with each other, and enjoying
each other's company in our home--the Castle.


We go to Dr. Baylor's house feeling relaxed and in a
very playful mood. We're on a holiday! When we get
there, we decide it would be a good idea to take the sheets
off the bed and wash them. Dr. Baylor has one of those

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now Rose isn't a hard worker. She's there at Dr. Baylor's
house for some heavy "rest and relaxation." And rest
she does. The soft chairs in Dr. Baylor's living room are
irresistible. Flopped down in a big arm chair, she calls into
the kitchen, "Marie, why don't you start the washer ...
and when it's ready we'll do the sheets. Me, I'm just gonna
take it easy here."


I put the hose in the washer and turn it on.


"Marie, come in here," Rose calls out from the living
room. "Come in and pull up a chair."


There's Rose, stretched out in the arm chair, smoking a
cigarette, looking like a passenger on a million-dollar luxury
cruise-liner. I join her in a cigarette and relax in another
chair. We break into a full smile as we look at each other--
and then we laugh ... and laugh. We figure we have the
whole day for ourselves, and we can eat when we want,
smoke, do anything we please! We talk and talk, two special
ladies enjoying the privilege of the elite rich.


A realization suddenly disturbs me! "Dr. Baylor comes
home for lunch at noon," I say to Rose, "and she's
prompt!" I look at my watch--quarter to twelve. We go
towards the kitchen so we'll look busy when Dr. Baylor
arrives.


The sound is strange, like a little mountain stream. At
first it doesn't mean anything. Then I wonder ... and then
I become alarmed. Nearly slipping, I splash through the
water which now covers the kitchen floor. Finally I reach
the washer and frantically turn off the faucet where the
hose is attached, while the remaining water spills over the
side of the washer. Alarm turns to laughter as I survey the
kitchen under water. Then I return to the business at hand.

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976809-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Rose, our plans have changed," I announce, barely able
to stop laughing. "It's work time." And for the next fifteen
minutes, racing against the clock, we mop up the
water. The last mop full is wrung out and the floor dried
one minute before noon. Dr. Baylor arrives promptly at
twelve.


"Now that's what I call a clean kitchen!" she states with
pride, feeling good about the quality of our work. "That's
wonderful. But you really didn't have to wash the floor!"


Rose and I look at each other, but our laughter remains
within. We're just good little patients and we thank Dr.
Baylor for her compliment.


"That's the last time I go out to work with you," Rose
says in mock seriousness as we walk back to the ward. "Do
you really think I'm meant to work? Work can make you
tired, you know!"
