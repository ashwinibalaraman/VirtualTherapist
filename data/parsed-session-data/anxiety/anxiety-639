<font size="4"><b>Is This My Last Lay</b></font>

I don't know what women and sex and cumming mean to me anymore.
It's been a struggle, these past six years, having sex without
the aid of feeling inebriated beforehand. I haven't been with too
many women since I got sober. I got out of relationships that weren't
meant to go anywhere, yet now I don't know where I ever wanted
them to go; or, most horrible, where I want this new one I'm in to go.


I don't give a shit that I'm in my early fifties. I couldn't care less
that I can't go back in time. I just don't know how to shake the nasty
sensation that if I remain with my girlfriend and grow old with her
and am faithful, then <i>this is my last lay</i>, and in some corner of my
adolescent head, I'm left feeling like a dead man.


People in Mozambique are dying tonight, and flood victims have

Sure I'm sometimes self-centered and selfish, but I also have genuine
fears about being dragged down by people who will suck me
dry of my destiny. The sober me can't stomach the prospect of having
my own traveling time dictated by other people's selfishness and
insanity. I already did thatâ€”to myself. The challenge for me is to
learn to distinguish someone's love from my perception of it as a
control mechanism. I'd rather bring myself down. It's simpler and
less expensive.


I'm not whining but I was hurt emotionally as a kid, mainly by
being treated much of the time like I was just a little sideshow getting
in the way of everyone else's desires and goals. I can't recall the
moment when I first felt that I was something other than a shackle
on everyone's lives, but I do know that tonight I still feel like a nothing
when I contemplate that I'm probably with my last woman, even
if she's the best. This sickens me to no end. I have a recovering
buddy fighting cancer and he told me that he almost died so many
times overdosing, that he wasn't afraid of dying anymore as much as
being taken by the cancer before he really got to know himself. Now
<i>that</i> shit really makes me feel pitiful. Here I am, a recovering addict,
who isn't dragging my ass in for radiation and chemo, but punishing
a healthy body by being fearful of trusting love. I'm afraid that it
might take a stroke of bad luck, like a stroke, to force me into some
pathetic last-ditch effort to love, and be loved.


It's criminal that I haven't been able to shake this self-hatred. I
can battle back from alcoholism, but continue to batter and imprison
myself from real love. It's surely not this glorious woman who is giving
me the willies, but an emptiness that seems to strike me so
effortlessly, paralyzing my heart whenever someone really loves me;

I'd love to be able to love her, be loved by her, and never get laid
by anyone else again before I'm laid to rest, rather than pursue this
childish hard-on for sexual barrenness. Otherwise my soul will most
probably wander down the streets of the universe, unhappy and
pouting, as I'm forced to look aimlessly, with my newly acquired
death-ray vision, into the homes of happy people still alive, and
actually treating themselves to a little bit of tenderness.


If this is my last lay I'm a lucky man. If it isn't, although <i>Mr.
Integrity</i> here believes it should be, not only won't I probably live to
understand myself, but I honestly feel that I'm somehow trivializing
my buddy's bout with cancer, who doesn't come close to having the
odds I do to celebrate a healthy serenity, once and for all.


If I got sober to stay stupid it's the biggest practical joke I could
ever pull on myself.
