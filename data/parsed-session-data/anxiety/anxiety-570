<b><i>Imagining the World</i></b>


CLIFF WAS SPENDING more and more time at work, rushing out
before eight, sometimes not home until seven. There was a crackle in
the air between us. His body, when I passed it in the hall, seemed
almost hot from anger (or was it mine I was feeling?)."Why aren't you
doing all the floor time sessions you're supposed to?" I wanted to say.
I said it once. It didn't help. "Why don't you even look at me once in
a while?" he probably wanted to ask. We didn't talk much. Sometimes
we could span the gulf--other times ...


Debbie Roth-Howe suggested we go out together. I called
Donna, our day-care provider. She agreed to watch the kids at her
house from 6:00 to 10:00. Exactly what I was hoping for from this
"date" is difficult to define. We'd have the whole evening to ourselves.
Anger was melting away to excitement. We would be together, the
way we had once been together. I washed my hair when Arlene came
over (even though technically she was supposed to be training me). I
found myself looking in the mirror for the first time in months. I
didn't like what I saw. My eyes looked popped out, almost scared,
encircled in a gray shadow. I took a few minutes to blot the shadows
with cover stick, put on mascara, a dress, nice shoes. At 6:00, the time
we were supposed to be arriving with the kids together at Donna's, I
sat in the kitchen with Walker and Elizabeth, waiting for Cliff to come
home. Elizabeth began making jokes, poking at Walker, putting her
face up to him and making faces. He began laughing hysterically. I
couldn't calm him down. I kept looking out the window, staring at
the driveway as if looking could make Cliff come home. He was
twenty-five minutes late when he finally rolled in. My excitement

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00238&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He came in the door. "I'm sorry. I know I'm late. Something came
up just as I was about to leave." He put his arms around me, buried
his head in my neck. I barely responded, didn't put my arms back
around him.


I didn't speak much at first during the dinner. Cliff told some stories
from work. When I finally softened, I brought up a problem about
Walker. An uneasy silence grew. After dinner we wandered through
town. We used to love a stroll, a discussion, a dessert. Now we seemed
aimless.


"Why didn't we plan to do something?" said Cliff.


"We're doing something," I said.


It was 10:30 by the time we arrived home, and I carried a sleeping
Walker up the stairs and placed him on his changing table. Though he
was nearly three, he still wore pull-ups, disposable, absorbent underwear.
Arlene had encouraged me to let Walker climb with supervision,
and I had taught him to climb down from the changing table. When
I realized that no pull-ups were on the shelf, I left Walker up on the
table and stepped away to retrieve one. While rifling through the
backpack, I heard a crash.


Walker lay on the floor, panting. He lay frozen, and then he began
screaming. I brought him to my bedroom next door. He was shaking,
crying in broken syllables, "Wa' off, wash ... it ... off."


"Wash what?" I asked, searching for blood.


"Can you move?"


He didn't answer. <i>Had he broken his neck?</i>


The doctor told me to call 911. I did immediately. Within minutes,
two huge men in uniforms were standing in my bedroom. "Go away,
go away." Walker began screaming.


They opened a large bag and produced a stuffed bear which they
gave to Walker. He didn't smile, but gripped the bear tightly with his
fingers.


Within minutes, they were wrapping Walker around a board with
white tape, and he was taken by ambulance to the hospital.

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00239&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He proved to have broken his collarbone. The doctor explained
that it would heal easily. "Often the collarbone is removed and used
to replace other bones; the collarbone will completely grow back
inside the membrane." Yet Walker hobbled around the house for the
next few weeks in a brace. Elizabeth laughed at him, said he looked
like "a little old man."


By the time Walker was two and a half, he had mastered Greenspan's
first four milestones. He could stay calm enough to engage for
increasing blocks of time (milestone one); he was attached to Lisa,
Dawn, and Arlene and to Cliff, Elizabeth, and me (milestone two); he
was interacting with his world, seeing his effect on it (level three); and
he was using gestures and words (level four). And he was growing
more used to balls that jumped and whirled in frantic imitation of all
things human and unpredictable. Yet his play was still very much stuck
in isolated moments.


Arlene was eager to bring on more pretend play.


By then, so was I. I knew that to teach Walker to use his imagination
was not only to teach him to understand himself, but equally, to
build the foundation for higher reasoning. If Walker could master
pretend play, he would not only be more emotionally aware, he would
be cognitively more sophisticated as well. Imagination, Greenspan's
theory asserts, is the screen on which the mind begins to project possibilities
beyond what is.


Still, looking at my developmental milestone chart was a dry exercise.
Looking at a chart couldn't possibly prepare me for what I was
about to learn.


When I thought about the fundamentals of early childhood education,
of course, the first activity that sprang to mind for most of my
life had always been the great clich√© of childhood education: the
alphabet. I had naively believed that besides perhaps learning about
seasons and colors, a child doesn't begin his education until he firmly
masters the great symbols of spoken sound. But now Dawn told me

[p. <i>224</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00240&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Imaginative play was the first and real schoolhouse, the stage on
which all abstract thinking plays itself out.


With Walker we were now working in a brightened room.


Walker was acting out gestures of pretend play. He might feed a
baby a bottle or run a train on the track, play at cutting a wooden vegetable
designed to break in half, then switch track himself. He loved
to run to the door and pretend he was going out. Dawn worked at
expanding such play. "Where are you going?" she asked. He stopped
and considered.


"Shopping," he said. She added more questions, more steps. Soon
it became a custom for Dawn to give Walker her keys. He took them
and ran to the door, pushed a key into the old skeleton keyhole and
turned it. The lock didn't work, but that was the point--pretend was
pretend. In Walker's mind it worked. He opened the door, already ajar,
and pretended to go outside. Soon Dawn added props: a shopping
bag, plastic fruit and vegetables, cereal boxes. Eventually we made it
outside to Elizabeth's plastic minivan, and Walker, propelling the
weight of the van with his feet, shuffled away to the store. Imagining
worlds that didn't exist, Walker was taking the first step toward learning
Euclidean geometry.


I attended a conference by one of Greenspan's associates, Serena
Wieder, coauthor of <i>The Child with Special Needs</i>.


"But he wants to be a policeman. That's all he talks about," said
someone about her child at the conference. Obsession, getting stuck in
feedback loops, was a hazard of the disorder--keeping together the
complex machinery of feelings and ideas and planning. Wieder said,
"For some children, obsessions are a solution. A child might move in
circles if he's anxious about change. You need to find a way out of that

[p. <i>225</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00241&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If kids get stuck in the same stories, their minds, too, their psyches
could get stuck. At home and at school, they might be less flexible.


There were levels of development in imaginative play. Or rather, as
I understood it, the growth of a kid's imagination is like a tree, growing
up and out and branching, leafing, flowering. The first level was
easy enough. A child uses a toy as a prop. He picks up a bottle and
feeds the doll. It's not just a small pretend gesture, but one imbued
with deep significance for a child: He's exploring his first emotional
theme--dependence and nurturing. The imagination, of course, does
not stop there. A child learns to use nothing as a prop. The ability to
use no prop is higher because it means you've moved into abstraction:
Marcel Marceau clutches at a cylinder of air and drinks it; the child
projects what might be onto what is not, using his body to show what
the mind alone has created. "When a child can use an invisible hose to
put out an invisible fire in role-play, his imagination is cooking," said
Wieder.


At some point a child will begin to "elaborate" on these skills and
other skills, using variety and spontaneity. As he does, the play turns
from small phrases to longer episodes. One branch of growth involves
using an object and pretending it's something else. Wieder encouraged
parents and therapists at the conference to use objects as unlike the
imagined object as possible to help the imagination stretch. A doll is
a telephone; a pencil is the ocean.


One of the most important aspects of the imagination as it branches
into being happens when a child begins to pretend he is someone
else. He puts himself in another person's shoes and begins to explore
through his own inner space the workings of one of the most important
aspects of the outside world: another persons mind.


Imagination grows and expands exponentially; feelings and ideas
come into play.

[p. <i>226</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00242&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another significant branch of development occurs when a child
begins to project his identity into action figures. Sometimes with
action figures a child can manipulate his reality more easily. He can be
Batman one minute and Joker the next. He can be a little god,
creating his universe anew, manipulating concepts, experimenting,
evaluating, thinking, feeling.


At first, like all children, Walker had been only able to hold a bottle to a
baby and pretend she drank. Shortly before he broke his collarbone,
Walker had reached a state where he was donning firemen's hats, running
through the house in a pretend fire truck, driving Elizabeth's van.
Still, the play could be short lived, and not particularly varied. Dawn
wanted to work on more complexity. She also hoped Walker would
learn to use action figures to represent himself. Serena Wieder had said
that children at first were reluctant to project their own selves into action
figures because they didn't want to give up that desired object. <i>Did that
mean that the child was too literal in that phase?</i> I wondered. But Walker may
have had a different reason for avoiding action figures--if they were difficult
to manipulate conceptually, they were even more difficult to
manipulate physically.


Damage to bone had a dramatic effect on Walker's imaginative play. It
grew quickly in richness, complexity, passion. For a full year we played
out many imaginary scenarios. We were doctors together and patients
together. The couch was an ambulance. I often sat in the middle and
drove it. Or Cliff pulled Walker in the laundry basket through the dining
room to the living room. First one of us had a broken collarbone,
and eventually other bodily traumas--broken legs, head injuries, broken
hearts.


One day, Walker pulled an action figure out of the toy basket and said,
"This is me." He threw the little man on the ground and said, "He broke
his collarbone." Walker was branching out in his imaginative play. He
could move from being a character, to projecting himself into a toy character,
and back again. After that day we played all kinds of ways. We pretended
to be people, or we played with symbols of people--real people
were patients; action figures might be doctors. They climbed into boxes
that were ambulances and drove away to the hospital beside the couch.

[p. <i>227</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00243&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>A Close Call</i></b>


BY DECEMBER 1998 when Walker was a few months past two, he was
often affectionate, talkative, and interactive, grabbing and drinking
everything that is life, full of excitement, happiness, and desire to
learn. "Your son's a flirt," said several women during various trips to
the market. Dawn and Arlene were deeply bonded to him, and he to
them. "How's my favorite client?" said Dawn when she came one day.
He was growing stronger and stronger.


Cliff and I joked that we felt like the picture of Dorian Gray. We were
the aging portrait; Walker was Gray, getting brighter and brighter
every day.


But the joke got old, sour. Or I was souring with it like the portrait.
Though I could feel gratitude, the sense of great luck we had, I
could often fall into a black space, perhaps because of the winter, perhaps
because I was working too hard. We had very little help during
that time--Amy was gone, Lisa was gone, and there was still so much
work that Greenspan insisted must be done ("You don't stop the job
in the middle!").


Still convinced that Walker's race was a race against time, I raced;
we raced. I told myself that the race would be short-lived, a sprint. <i>Just
a few more weeks. Just a few. And then we'll all make up for lost time</i>.


We were like great landmasses, Cliff and I, moving in different
directions. After dinner, he disappeared into Walker's room, I into
Elizabeth's. Sometimes those landmasses moved together into closely
fitting formations that made for continuity and stability--no earthquakes.
Other times the masses drifted apart, glacial.

[p. <i>228</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00244&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Cliff helped in all the ways he could. He still did much of the shopping,
brought take-out home some nights, and he always took Walker
to appointments where blood would be drawn; I couldn't manage it.
At night, Cliff read to Walker or they talked quietly at bedtime. On the
weekends, they were beginning to roughhouse together, though playing
rough could be so exciting that Walker couldn't settle to sleep those
nights. When we went to visit his parents, Cliff took over and fed
Walker. I stared straight ahead or talked with Cliffs mother and father,
tried to rest.


Most of the time, Cliff and I continued to pass each other in the
hall looking down at the ground--too shy or angry or too busy to
look. Sometimes Cliff and I tried to go out on a Saturday night, but
as often as not we argued.


I still hungered for time with Elizabeth. I spent an hour or so with
her in the evenings, but it wasn't enough. I even cleared away some
special time for her, but it was sometimes interrupted.


<i>I am gone much of the time from Elizabeth. We both know it. Those hours, perhaps
she thinks me as gone as any mother is gone who boards a train with a
suitcase, even though I am in the next room, singing the bottle song. Gone
because I am on the phone so much to doctors</i>.


Elizabeth invited friends over after school or on weekends. When I
had a moment, a break, I watched them play, though I wasn't always
welcome. She and her best friend, Emmi, had a secret game they
played. They insisted I not watch. Elizabeth seemed ashamed by the
thought I might look. I peeked through the window, couldn't help but
watch.


The first time I looked, I saw that she and Emmi were collecting
large fallen branches from our maple tree, branches the size of walking
sticks. A half an hour later I peeked out the window again and saw
Emmi limping across the backyard, with the stick under her arm as a
crutch. Emmi hobbled toward the tree. Elizabeth came rushing
toward her, walking efficiently, and helped her walk to the tree. Again
and again, I saw them out there (I still see them), leaning on walking
sticks, hobbling across the backyard. Elizabeth sometimes traded roles
with Emmi; she was the patient on crutches, making her way across
the yard, trying on the suit of being ill, broken.

[p. <i>229</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00245&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother came to spend Christmas with us. We had breakfast in
front of the fire in the dining room, the kids camped out on blankets
near the hearth, yet I was somehow out of control--rushing, cooking,
wrapping, lost in recipes, driven toward trying to make dreams come
true.


By New Year's Day, Walker was in the hospital, ill with the stomach
flu, dehydrated. No one knew why Walker had gotten so ill. The doctor
said it was simply a flu that had dehydrated him, but it was scary to
see an already frail child shrinking, sinking into illness, refusing drink.
We had brought him to the doctor, who arranged for someone in his
office to give Walker fluids via an IV, but no one could get the IV into
Walker; his veins were too small. They sent us to the hospital.


I sat with him in a waiting room for an hour and a half, and then
we were ushered into a large room with a large metal crib that looked
almost like an animal cage. I found myself talking in broken sentences
to the doctor who came in to interview me about the problem. What
should I tell her. Autism? Was the appellation even relevant any more?
Sensitive? She scribbled the words onto her chart.


I laid down on the squishy cushion of a foldout chair. It sagged
nearly to the ground.


<i>I remember my own childhood, how I used to fall into these worlds of illness,
especially around Christmas. Christmas--all the colors spinning and the
phone ringing and all of those loved ones wanting something, or me wanting
and hoping. Excitement and feeling always did me in. Often I was very sick;
once I landed in the hospital, with, strangely, the same symptoms that Walker
had that day--stomach illness, followed by dehydration. Illness could make the
world go away, everything seeming to change shape and form, smells growing,
time shrinking so that hours alone seemed like seconds and dreams seemed like
other planets, other worlds. The self would leave the body and roam elsewhere</i>.


I watched Walker while he slept, the IV taped to his small arm,
which occasionally flopped out through the bars of the crib. From
time to time, through the night, I pushed it back onto the mattress. All
the while they were pumping fluids into his veins. By morning he was

[p. <i>230</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00246&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Darkness of the winter grew with stress and solitude. I was fraying,
though I'm not sure I realized it.


One evening--the night before Cliff and I were to meet with
REACH about Walker's individual service plan, I went to a parent
meeting where I saw a husband and wife I knew from REACH.


"You look tired," said the wife.


"I am."


"Why?"


"I have tons of floor time sessions to do every day," I said.


"Our son's getting a tutor to do floor time," said the mother.


"We used to get that kind of help," I said, looking around the
room. My eyes stung by the fluorescent lights. I could barely think
straight.


"Used to?"


"I guess they don't think he needs it any more."


Her face turned red, her nostrils flared with outrage. "Do you
mean to tell me you're getting no help at all?"


"Well, Dawn and Arlene."


"Dawn and Arlene? We're getting twenty hours of floor time for
our son."


"Twenty hours a week?"


"Four hours a day," said the mother. "Yes," she added, "While I
work around the house."


I couldn't stop thinking of the number--<i>twenty</i>? I knew that
Walker was the first child to receive funds for a tutor to do floor time.
He was doing so well they were trying the program on several other
clients. But twenty? We had never gotten twenty hours. Even when
Walker was at his worst. Here was this mother with twenty hours of
help per week and I with nothing. I feared I might be getting sick.
Why?


I stayed up until 4 A.M. making a list of all my concerns about
Walker. I made a chart. All the while, the snow silently fell, enveloping

[p. <i>231</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00247&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Early the next morning, REACH'S director, Darken Corbett,
called me to say that Arlene, who lived in the country, was snowed
in. Would we be able to make the meeting?


"Yes," I said. "We'll be there."


Dawn, the director Darken, Claire (REACH'S clinical supervisor),
Cliff, and I sat on couches in a small room. The director took
my chart and begin addressing my concerns. Walker needs more oral
motor stimulation. Walker needs practice climbing stairs. "Pat, you
can do those, can't you?" All down the list it went like that until I was
weeping uncontrollably. "No," I finally said, sobbing, barely able to
talk, "I can't. I have nothing left to give."


"Now wait a minute, Pat," said Cliff. "We can do some of these
things on the list."


"Who can?" I said, turning on him. "Will you?"


"Yes," said Cliff.


Darleen looked at the list of things that Greenspan had insisted
Walker needed. "Some of these you can address later," she said.


"We're not going to wait," I said.


The argument went on like that for a long time--me weeping
and Darken trying to figure out which of the things that Walker
needed could be put on hold.


"Do you need to stop?" said Darken.


I shook my head. I didn't want to stop. We needed help. I couldn't
delay.


"Pat, I think maybe we'd better go." Cliff seemed embarrassed by
me, but when I refused to leave, he began reading from his copy of
the chart. "Four playdates a week. How can we start to do those,
Pat?"


"Don't you understand? I can't do any more. Even the effort of
calling ..."


"I'll call Therese," said Cliff. "I'll arrange a playdate."


I couldn't master the words that would have been filled with bile.
<i>You'll arrange the playdate, but who will host it?</i>


The rest of the meeting went on in a similar vein, the group figuring
out ways that we could fulfill all of Walker's needs without

[p. <i>232</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00248&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Through tears, again I tried to insist we were in need.


We knew what the problem was. REACH didn't see any signs of
autism in Walker. He was making strides, dramatic ones. And as long
as we worked to keep him moving forward, he would continue to
improve.


When I wouldn't accept their refusal, Darleen came on her knees,
held my hand, telling me, "We are not going to give you intensive
services. We do not believe your son has autism. Greenspan felt he was
pre-autistic at one point, but he's doing well now. Perhaps he never
had autism." She grew emotional herself and said, "I know how you
feel ... I know what it's like to have doctors telling you all you need
to do for your child, but we can't do it."


I wouldn't look at her. What crushed me was that she was unwilling
to embrace the paradox of diagnosis in this field. If you had a diagnosis,
you got help. If you didn't, you got nothing. There was no middle
ground, no gray area for accepting that autism was preventable, but
only with backbreaking work by a family. How could I convince
them Walker needed all of the things that Dr. Greenspan prescribed
and that I couldn't do it alone?


The meeting adjourned. As we left, Cliff put his hand on my
shoulder and said, "Maybe it's Pat who needs some help now." I realize
now that he was feeling sympathy for me, yet in that moment it
felt like betrayal. It was the final betrayal, as if he were implying that
they were right.


Within days, Debbie, our social worker, was back in my kitchen,
sitting at the table, trying to convince me that it might make sense for
me to enter the psychiatric unit of a hospital.


"So they've decided I'm crazy?" I said.


"Well, I guess what happened was worrisome. But let's talk about
you."


Debbie had not been working on our case for a while. Near the
time that Lisa left, Walker was doing so well that it didn't seem necessary.
She shook her head and said, "I should have seen this coming."


"How could anyone have seen it coming? Walker looked good."


I made the Dorian Gray joke. It was always good for a laugh.

[p. <i>233</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00249&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Seriously, Pat. <i>Have</i> you considered the hospital? People go there
to rest, to rejuvenate when life is too hard."


"What, McLean? The psychiatric hospital?"


"No," said Debbie. "There are psychiatric units in local hospitals.
You go there, spend a few days resting. It could help."


"So they think this is all my problem, don't they?"


"Let's just focus on what you need right now." Debbie went on to
describe what could happen in a psych unit. I imagined <i>a soft bed, me
floating in and out of sleep</i>. The thought of going sounded illicit ... <i>but
sleep? And someone else's cooking</i>?... I found myself fantasizing that
they might even drug me--give me some lovely intoxicant to send
awareness sinking in heavy water, consciousness burying itself in sand.
But it suddenly occurred to me that if I checked into the hospital, I
wouldn't be with Cliff.


Suddenly, I wanted nothing more than to be with him. That could
be the only real solace I could have--to spend time with my husband,
my closest friend. Being in the hospital would mean nothing compared
with being alone with him.


I was surprised to hear my thoughts running in such a direction. I
thought I had been angry at Cliff. In fact, I had sometimes imagined
us divorcing, things had been so cool between us. I had almost forgotten
who he was. Who I was. Yet now, my mind ran back to the days
when we sat and talked for hours in restaurants and cafes, parks and
museums in Cambridge and Boston. Huge, almond-shaped inquisitive
brown eyes meeting me across the table, we talked about religion,
about books, about philosophy. We talked about death. We talked
about meaning, and we talked about the meaning of meaning.
Bending down one day, watching some kids play with sticks by the
water's edge in the Boston Public Garden, I said I wanted children
some day. He kissed the top of my head. I thought back to Cliff and
in the early days of Walker's ... what could I call it? ... illness?--
remembered Cliff doing all the things Lenore had taught us. He still
did them. He had spent hours listening to me drone on and on about
sensory processing, about autism, about synapse overproduction. Cliff
had not embraced the obsession of mine that had been floor time, yet
now I saw that he couldn't have. He was protecting us, balancing us.
He was like the guy in a football game who keeps running in front of

[p. <i>234</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00250&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So often when Debbie and Leah had come to give us time alone
on Sundays in the past. Cliff and I had tried to connect, but it was like
the vacation we had taken once at Avila Beach. We wanted to make a
fire, but we had only a log, and no kindling. We couldn't get it started.


I was glad to hear myself thinking that I wanted to try again, to
rekindle.


I called Cliff. For me, it was a seminal moment. The moment of
truth. Cliff could either take me seriously, could either meet me
where I was, or he could leave me to go to the hospital.


After we talked. Cliff hung up and to my surprise, made
arrangements for the children to stay with our day-care provider,
Donna. We drove out of town, up toward the Berkshire Mountains,
climbing over snow-blanketed hills for miles. We passed rock formations
covered with ice that rose thirty feet above the ground. On
the craggy mountain faces, monstrous icicles, glass blown into the
shape of pipes, sweated in the sunlight. We stayed at an inn in Lee,
not far from Edith Wharton's Lenox house. Cliff booked the best
room they had, with its high-bolstered queen-size bed in front of a
fireplace and a large sliding glass window letting out onto the shore
beside the frozen lake. I brought <i>my New Yorker</i> and the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>--I hadn't read either in ... how long had it been? We
jumped into bed and read side by side for two hours in front of a
fire, occasionally watching men ice fish on the lake. For dinner, we
walked down the hall to a restaurant also overlooking the lake, ate
curried soup, fresh bread, nut-encrusted salmon, drank wine. Cliff
ordered champagne and said, "To us. It's good being with you." I
was shocked.


Within twenty-four hours, we were picking up the kids at
Donna's. I had never imagined that so little time could change two
people so profoundly. When I think of that trip, I realize that it was

[p. <i>235</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00251&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few days later, Darleen Corbett approached me at REACH.
Kneeling down beside me and Walker, who was playing on the
floor, she explained that she would send our request for a tutor to
her superiors at the Department of Mental Health. I knew the gesture
was pro forma. Walker was simply doing too well to warrant
our receiving help. Never mind that we were still supposed to give
him eight to ten floor times a day. Never mind that he was supposed
to be playing with four kids a week. Never mind that even
Greenspan probably didn't understand how difficult such a schedule
would be. Never mind that making a connection with another
mother would take hours. I knew what was required: a diagnosis.


I called Greenspan's office, and we arranged for an official diagnosis,
in spite of the fact that Greenspan didn't like to give them. He
would review Walker's chart, and I would call back with a fax number
he could send it to.


One call and we could become eligible for hours of tutor time.
Yet even as I was talking to the office, a strange dizzying feeling
came over me, as if I were making a mistake.


Cliff, home ill one afternoon, was standing behind me after I
hung up.


"Who were you talking to? What do you mean <i>diagnosis</i>?"


"We need one for Walker in order to receive services."


"Pat, don't you think that would be unethical? Do you want to
do this to Walker? Label him?"


"Cliff, I don't, but ... do you realize what this diagnosis would
mean? What kind of help we would receive?"

[p. <i>236</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00252&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do you realize what that label means--what it would mean for
Walker's records?"


I knew what Cliff meant. He meant that words shape thoughts and
thoughts shape deeds, and all that goes into these shape a child.
I didn't want to label Walker--not when I knew we had a chance of
escaping a label. Cliff became very ill that week, and it was easy to be
absorbed in making soup and tea and doing the shopping. I never
made the call.


One summer morning when Walker was two years and nine months
old, a photographer came to photograph him for a brochure for
REACH's parent organization. A writer had come a few days earlier
to hear and chronicle our story. They planned to feature Walker on the
brochure, along with three other families that the company was working
with. I hadn't had much time to think about the photo shoot. The
night before, I ironed one of Walker's navy blue T-shirts and some
shorts to match, and cleared away some toys in the living room. In the
morning, the doorbell rang earlier than I expected. A businesswoman
in a skirt stood in the frame; she had come to supervise the photo
shoot. The executive sat in a chair while I seated myself cross-legged
on the floor with Walker. I felt out of place. She wasn't at all pleased
with Walker's T-shirt, nor the matching shorts, no matter how
smoothly ironed.


<i>Why would Walker ever need a suit? When would I have time to buy
something like that?</i> The photographer came, a gentle, sensitive man
who also worked for <i>National Geographic</i>. He began to set up. There
was such irony in the bright photographer's light, the executive in her
finery watching him set up. We were going to advertise the heights
the organization brings to mankind. I was happy to do it. Where
would we have been without REACH? They were heroes. Their parent
company was a great institution. But right here and now, this businesswoman
seemed to know so little about our lives. She didn't
understand that we were still struggling every day, that every second
was precious to us, that we had come far with Walker but we had not

[p. <i>237</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00253&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went upstairs and fished around for another outfit, something the
executive might consider more appropriate. I quickly put Walker in a
one-piece suit someone had given us, with colorful pictures of tools
sewn on in primary colors. It was still far too big for his frame, but it
was really the nicest baby outfit I had. (<i>What was I going to be dressing
him for? Where were we going to go? Disneyland? To fairs? To restaurants?)</i>
As for me, if she didn't like the dress I was wearing, I would go
upstairs and change.


REACH found a volunteer named Catherine to help me. She came
for about two to four hours per week. She wore a nose ring and black
skirts and shirts and loved to talk. We sat in the dining room and chatted.
She brought Walker gifts occasionally--books or toys. I looked
forward to her visits and loved to listen to her stories. One day
Catherine and I were standing over Walker's crib watching him sleep,
and she confided that she had a neurological condition.


"All of sudden things will come racing toward my eyes, as if everything
is sped up and it's moving toward me at light speed." I wondered
if Walker had such perceptions. Was it possible to experience speed
differently? Time differently?


We had other college students who helped, volunteers or workers,
housecleaners--from Bulgaria, from Romania, from Pakistan. Several
Americans. Somehow each drifted off as students will do at finals
time, or they felt the pull of home or the draw of politics.

<b><i>Companions</i></b>


<i>WE FINALLY DID IT Made it up the "food chain. "We belong. We can
make it in groups</i>.


Walker was growing more tolerant. We were beginning to take
him to REACH for successful playgroups. The kids played in a large
room full of sand tables and puzzles and toy car garages while their
parents sat on the floor, joining in. But here was the delicious, the
most lovely moment of my week. The first day, the educator running
the group explained that after the first hour, the kids would convene
at a table and eat snacks and the adults would leave to convene with
the social worker.


I recognized the name of the social worker I'd dismissed from our
case. I grew nervous. <i>She probably hated me</i>. As the playgroup progressed,
I became increasingly agitated and self-conscious. The children
gathered for snacks, and the social worker came to the doorway
and stood there. Was she going to snub me? Should I apologize? I
thought about avoiding her gaze, but thought I'd better look. And she
did something surprising. She looked me in the eyes warmly. I saw in
that moment that she had always meant to help me. That her mission
was for me to take care of myself It was a message I was ready for.


She ushered the parents into a small, cozy room with white couches.
She turned the fluorescent lights off and lit the table lamps and
began gently to invite us to talk about ourselves.


We might all have been at REACH so our children would gain
socialization skills in the adjoining room, but the truth is that the
socialization I was receiving in the room next door to Walker was

[p. <i>239</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00255&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ever sympathetic to the question of how to create playdates and
opportunities for socialization, Arlene combined her appointments so
she could work with three children at once. She created a session for
Walker and two other boys whom I'll call Allen and Steven. She set
up ball baths (a kid's pool filled with plastic balls), and tunnels, ramps,
and ladders. Walker and his companions ran around following each
other, sliding down slides, tossing their bodies in the balls, laughing,
throwing the balls in the air, playing treasure hunt, sitting on balls in
a circle, trying to balance and sing at once. She turned off the lights,
gave each one a flashlight and had them touch each other's spots of
light on the ceiling. Such a game would teach visual tracking and
would combine verbal with physical activities. Keeping track of the
adults in the room would be an added challenge for the kids. She had
them listen to music together, climb stairs after one another, tricycle
together, pull each other in a wagon.


Walker was often exhausted by such a level of stimulation. In the
middle of the session, he would lie down and suck his thumb and not
get up. Steven's mother asked, "Does he have heart trouble?"


"No," I said. "At least I don't think so."


"Why is he so tired?"


I looked at Arlene. She shook her head.


Two years later, I called Arlene one day because I was looking for
information for an article that I was writing about Walker. Arlene was
home from work. She said she needed to take a bath; she was having
a hard day. Steven had died. His troubled heart had given out.

[p. <i>240</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00256&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>A Searchlight</i></b>


THE IDEA, AS I UNDERSTOOD IT, was to teach Walker to be as
familiar with the world as he was with the inside of his own head, and
vice versa. Knowing your desires is to truly know your world; and to
know your world is to know what you desire from it.


Dawn, Arlene, and Greenspan insisted we ask questions.


Questions continually sent Walker's awareness ever outward into
that vast world, so intricately linked to who Walker was becoming.
Questions also drove him time and again to examine, to question, to
review and understand his own logic.Yet whether he was moving his
awareness outward or inward, the point was always the "connection"--
to connect his consciousness to the process of interacting intellectually
with the world. Reflection, analysis, decisionmaking, communication.
I never realized how powerful a simple question could be.


Greenspan's purpose was, as usual, twofold, threefold, fourfold. Walker
needed not just a way for knowing the world and himself in relation
to it, not just a language for speaking that knowledge, not just an
awareness of time, and space (When do you want it? Where do you
want it?). He also needed to learn the rhythm of communication. He
needed to be able to answer quickly, to shoot back the ball as quickly
as it shot to him. If he couldn't do this, he couldn't play the game that
was social interaction. Greenspan didn't want him to be left on the
bleachers.


Questions would help Walker know his desire, and know his place
in this earthly maze.

[p. <i>241</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00257&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so we asked questions. We asked them in the car, we asked
them at the dinner table. We asked them during play. We asked them
during bath. We asked them at bedtime.


When I asked him questions, I often think I was giving a ticket to
Walker, a problem that could only be answered by imaginary travel. I
envisioned a searchlight, going where it needed to go on the imaginary
trip of coming to a conclusion. If I asked Walker, "What do you
want to eat?" I watched him, watched him think intently. This is what
I imagine took place.


The searchlight first leaves Walker's body, spins its way upward and
outward into the world, going to wherever it needs to go to answer
the question. It may race through the house or out to the market or
to any place that may have clues for what Walker might want from the
world. At the same time, the light also searches his body. It moves
quickly through his organs, through his heart, his legs, his gut, searching
to find the right answer. What <i>do</i> I want to eat?


As Walker learns to ask questions, I begin to wonder if it might be
possible that the nervous system actually holds sensory information in
the place that experiences it. <i>What does Walker's chest tell him about how
it feels to be hungry? What does his gut and his throat know about his love
of sorbet or hamburger or rice noodles?</i> Eventually, the searchlight has collected
all the raw material needed to make an answer. It returns to
Walker's brain with an answer.


At first, with Walker, the process of answering a question such as
"What do you want to eat?" is slow. I imagine the searchlight combing
the kitchen, the supermarket, the stands at the farmers' market.
Usually, after a while, he replies, "I want a banana."


Then I am supposed to up the ante: "Why?" I ask.


At first, he might not answer. Is the searchlight stuck somewhere?
Is it seeing too much?


I wait for a response. "Because ...," I finally prompt.


"Because." He pauses.


But his eventual answer has nothing to do with food.


"I want to go outside." (Perhaps the vast amounts of information
he ponders and searches derail him, remind him too much of other
things in the world?)

[p. <i>242</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00258&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Why?"


Silence.


Is he thinking about the first question or the second? I'm not even
sure he is still thinking about either one. Yet he's intent. The searchlight
seems to be going back inside, collecting words this time.


"It's cold."


"You mean you want to go outside?"


"Yes."


Up the ante again. "Why? Why do you want to be in the cold?"


Pause.


"... Because? ..."


"Because ... "A pause. "I like cold."


Now we're getting somewhere, but it is still not enough for Dawn,
Arlene, or Greenspan, I know.


"Why do you like cold?"


"Because I do."


I cheat, I can't stand it. I want to give him some ideas. "Does it feel
good on the skin?" "Do you like the wind?" The searchlight moves
out into the world again, perhaps into the breeze.


"Good on my face," he says.


There were times when asking so many questions, when forcing
the searchlight to stay on the move, I felt I was asking too much from
Walker--from anyone his age, asking him to account for every whim.


I have noticed that most kids don't seem to naturally like "Why?"
questions. They seem to live somewhere outside of why. Perhaps they
want to be like parents and say: "Because I said so." Perhaps it is
because rather than having to analyze, kids prefer the ever-present
moment of feeling and desiring. Kid spontaneity might just want to
grab up pieces of life and devour them whole cloth. Did it matter to
Walker what explanations were--why, for instance, he felt love for me
and Cliff and Elizabeth, why he wanted to look into our eyes and
laugh seemingly at the whole farce of life and love?


No, it didn't.


Where is Daddy? When do you want me to give it to you? Which is
your favorite? What's so good about that? How soon should we go?

[p. <i>243</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00259&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What's bad about it? Why did you say that? Why did you choose that
one? Which one is prettier? Why do you think? Why do you feel?
What do you want? When do you want it? Flow come you're ...?


After a year of constant questions, Walker could have held his own on
any talk show.

[p. <i>244</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00260&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>The Senses Revisited</i></b>


EARLY IN HIS TRAINING, neurologist Antonio Damasio encountered
a patient who was suffering from a severe case of "refractory
trigeminal neuralgia," a condition in which the nerves of the face
are so sensitive that even a slight gust of wind can create excruciating
pain. Since there was no help in sight and no medication to
relieve the patient's suffering, as a last resort Damasio's mentor, neurosurgeon
Almeida Lima, performed an operation to produce small
cuts in a part of the frontal lobe (such lesions had been shown to
relieve pain). According to Damasio's account, the day before the
operation, the patient was nearly frozen in fear of making the slightest
move, yet after the operation Damasio witnessed a man seemingly
in a state of miraculous recovery, happily playing cards with
another patient.


The patient was asked if the pain was gone.


Remarkably, the patient said, "No." He still felt the pain, yet somehow
what he didn't feel was any emotion about that pain. There was
no suffering because there was no emotion in response to the pain,
even though the sensation of pain was present. Damasio calls this a
"dissociation between 'pain sensation' and 'pain affect.'"


This story fascinated me when I read it because it underscores the
mysterious and powerful connection between sensation and emotion.
Damasio himself uses the example to explain the separation of emotion
and feeling. They are not one, he insists; but I argue, how separate
can emotion and sensation be if it takes an operation to separate
them? What we feel in our bodies is deeply bound to what we feel in
our emotions. In fact, Walker has taught me that emotions may be

[p. <i>245</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00261&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The summer of 1999 (Walker was two and a half), we visited my
mother and father in Los Angeles. One morning I wandered into my
mother's bedroom and found her applying makeup. Leaning against
her doorjamb to chat for a few minutes, I found myself browsing her
bookshelf across the room. There, among her books from the 1960s,
<i>The Second Sex, The Feminine Mystique, Human Sexuality</i>, I saw Bruno
Bettelheim's <i>The Empty Fortress</i>. It had been two years since I had first
found a few insulting phrases in the book and then felt compelled to
close it and read no further, and almost as long since I learned
Bettelheim had been exposed as a fraud. Even though he'd been dismissed
by many in his field, it occurred to me that since he had studied
autism, perhaps he might have observed something about the children
in his caseload to suggest that they were hypersensitive. Now I
pulled the book off the shelf, this time with the idea of skimming it
for information about the sensory system. I knew that <i>The Empty
Fortress</i> had been written almost a decade before Jean Ayres had
coined the term "sensory integration," yet Ayres, it seemed to me, was
merely putting to words what other professionals must have been
observing. I read through the convoluted snare of words describing
the deeply felt, singular moment when a child takes a breast into his
mouth. I flipped through and found little on sensitivity. Briefly,
Bettelheim noted the peculiar, almost mystical, capacity of patients
with autism to detect the presence of a cavity before it appeared to
the clinic dentist, yet he made little connection between physical sensitivity
and the difficulties the children were facing. Bettelheim, as all
the critics had already said, had indeed missed the boat on the subject
of sensory defensiveness and the emotional withdrawal of his patients.
Yet despite this, I was interested in him now because he had been an
icon of his age. What was it about Bettelheim's age that made him so
popular, and why had he, as had so many in his camp, missed noticing
the sensitivities of his patients?


When we came home, whenever I found time, I researched the subject
of sensitivity, which by then had me in its two-fisted though

[p. <i>246</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Why was it so difficult to accept these simple observations and integrate
them into an understanding of the behavior of people with
autism? Temple Grandin asserts that looking at sensory processing
problems was not compatible with the behavioral approach, which
chooses to change behavior without particularly analyzing its causes,
an approach that began with the work of B. F. Skinner and his followers,
and in the 1980s and 1990s was increasing in popularity.


I began to suspect that the problem of not accepting sensory integration
and sensory processing explanations for autistic behavior might
indeed reach back much further--to the roots of our culture with its
emphasis on the intellect.


Greenspan's philosophy, of course, is based on the notion that the
body and nervous system play a major role in what we would usually
think of as psychological urges. He is adamant that muscle tone, and
the use or lack of use of certain muscles, deeply influences social
assertiveness, for example. I accepted these truths reluctantly, f guess I
was wired to be a Platonist.


Thinking and reading on the subject every day--between sessions
when I picked up Elizabeth from dance or going to the "Y" or whatever
I was doing, I drew a clearer picture for myself of how our culture
has long neglected the development of highly individualized
nervous systems (which we all must have).


Freud's therapeutic model and the models for understanding
human behavior we've all come to embrace are largely based on the

[p. <i>247</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00263&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sensory integration theory, as well as the many discoveries being
made about the various processing functions, suggests that the abilities
we are born with--sensory processing capacity, ability to process
language, motor-planning ability--are significant factors in the fates
of children, and even in their lives as they grow to be adults.


It's clear that differences in sensory processing ability, especially if
not well understood or treated, follow us into adulthood. For this reason,
each of us--neurologically hardwired differently--ironically
"determines," or plays a large part in determining, our own environment.
As Greenspan explains, if as a baby, I frown at Mom because I'm
overwhelmed, she will frown back--the cycle of me "creating" my
world, and it creating me, goes on and on.


As I began attending lectures on sensory processing, I became familiar
with an idea that has become widely accepted among occupational
therapists--the notion that most of us don't necessarily need to rely
on outside sources to understand what sensory integration, or sensory
processing disorders, feels like. When the average person is ill, the
brain and sensory system, absorbed with healing itself and managing
pain, has difficulty tolerating "normal" amounts of stimulation. The
body and neurological system are already overloaded by the illness
and, like a computer given too much information to process too
quickly, need to shut down some systems. This is why people who are
extremely nauseated, for instance, can't stand to be touched. When
we're sick, we often experience bright lights as painful. (Have you ever
been so ill that you didn't realize that time had passed, even though
you were actually awake?) Sensory integration and sensory processing
problems distort perceptions.


Sensory integration theory teaches that the amount of sensation we
are processing often determines how we feel in our bodies; the

[p. <i>248</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00264&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How many of us suffer from sensory problems?


I found my answer when Walker was three. I watched a videotape
of Patricia Wilbarger helping a boy diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder and sensory integration disorder dramatically change his
behavior and functioning levels merely by having his mother brush
him firmly with a surgical brush once every two hours and apply
pressure to his joints.


Wilbarger estimates that 15 percent of the general population suffers
from tactile defensiveness, a catchall phrase describing sensory
problems of all kinds. "That means that 15 percent of people will walk
the streets in 'alarm pain.' They don't know how to keep themselves
calm." They dwell in a persistent state of overstimulation. As the camera
focuses in, Wilbarger makes an urgent call for health-care professionals
to rule out S.I. disorder before they make diagnoses that may,
in fact, be incorrect. Of such misdiagnosed or ignored individuals, she
says, "They will suffer their whole lives, walking the streets, not knowing
what they have. To cope with tactile defensiveness some will take
drugs, alcohol, will need to jog, or will only feel better after a fight.
And they will never know why."


Other estimates regarding how many people in the general population
suffer sensory integration problems run as high as 30 percent.


New discoveries about sensory processing suggest that each of us--
not just those with the disorder--experiences our senses differently,
depending of course on how sensitive or insensitive we are in various
areas. Combinations of sensitivity and insensitivity are as varied in the
human population as are shape and color in nature. Some people, for

[p. <i>249</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00265&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Walker emerged from his separate, internal landscape and began
to share every waking moment, I began to wonder what exactly we
were sharing. I began, too, to wonder what experience I was really
sharing with Cliff and Elizabeth. If we are all experiencing the world
of sensory stimulation and overstimulation at different rates at different
times in vastly different patterns, this information suggests that it
is not just those with hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity who are living
"in other worlds." We must all, whether in subtle or dramatic
ways, be experiencing very different lives even while sharing them.


One of the hallmarks of severe sensory integration disorder, for
instance, is "stimming"--an individual's need for repetitive behavior
to soothe himself. People with autism, for instance, spin in circles or
flap their arms up and down to stimulate the vestibular sense. They
spin plates or move their hands in front of their eyes, as a form of
visual stimulation. They bang their heads to receive input to the proprioceptive
sense, perhaps to provide deep pressure. Any such form
of stimulation is an attempt to calm a stressed nervous system or to
stimulate one that craves input. Yet I learned that we all "stim."We all
engage in repetitive activities to soothe our nervous systems. Nail
biting is stimming. So is chewing on the ends of pens, chewing gum,
and manipulating small objects repetitively in the hands (such as
bending a paper clip or fiddling unnecessarily with a pen).The difference
between people with profound S.I. problems and the rest of
us may just be the level to which we need to participate in self-stimming
activities, and the social acceptability of the activities we
choose. Many of the actions that typical individuals take to calm their
nervous systems, may be, in fact, more destructive than hand flapping,
though of course not as self-destructive as head banging, or smoking
cigarettes, drinking alcohol, drinking too much coffee, and obsessively
eating. Chewing is a form of proprioceptive input to the jaw

Those who study sensory integration posit that all sensory input is
"information." Light is information. Color is information. Voices are
information. Moving pictures are information. Information is information.
The more detail, the more information.


<i>Consider this experience: You are standing in the vegetable section of the
supermarket trying to figure out how many mushrooms you will need for a
quiche. Standing next to you is a man on a cell phone talking to someone.
"I'll be home, but I have to go out again," he says. There is a momentary
pause during which you locate some on-sale mushrooms, when he begins to
yell, "What do you mean?" You are trying to listen now, intent on understanding
why he is so upset, but then suddenly on the loudspeaker an
announcer begins to speak, "Shoppers, it is our sincerest goal here at
Shopper's Square for you to know that we value your patronage above anything
else. We hope to make your shopping experience as pleasant as possible.
If there's anything ..." The announcement is cut off by a loud
female voice that says: "A two-year-old child named Nathan has been lost.
Anyone who finds him, bring him to the service desk please." When she
cuts off the loudspeaker, the recording is advertising the two-for-one sale on
fall floral arrangements at the florist's shop. A woman passes by, offering you
a flyer on a car wash fund-raiser. The man on the phone says, "I'll do it
this time, but stop pushing me."</i>

Humans, as the study of autism and sensory dysfunction has taught
us, have a logical response to being overwhelmed: we retreat into
more internal worlds. The Information Age may be presenting to us,
as a culture, this unique problem of the person with autism: we are
at once isolated and overwhelmed. Like autistic individuals, we are
often inundated with information that our nervous systems may not
be well adapted to handle, particularly since massive amounts of
information not well integrated with healthy emotional interaction
can be corrosive to a healthy nervous system. Furthermore, the
"older," more atavistic parts of our brains may simply not be prepared
for massive amounts of stimulation. If this is true, then S.I. theory,
and other theories penetrating the mysteries of the sensory system,
will offer important information about how we carry tension,
who is most susceptible to anxiety in an overstimulating environment,
how we can relieve stress and lead calmer, more fulfilling lives
in an age when autism may be becoming a metaphor for how we all
live.


<i>Right now, I sit in the basement of a coffeehouse. It has overstuffed couches,
dim lighting, as if it were meant to be a saloon--instead, it's designed so
that patrons can come, sit at small tables by themselves, access the Internet,
or plug in their own laptops. Across the way sits a man working on his laptop.
I don't say anything to him and I probably won't. He is biting the sides
of his finger. Next to me. is another man. He plays with his beard and stares
at a screen I can't see. I play with my lips a bit, look at these words. We all
manipulate our information, doing our best at parallel play. This could be the
autism ward of a special school</i>.


Just as extremely overstimulating situations help us understand
autism, understanding autism helps us see the ways that overemphasizing
"information" and the manipulation of information in our
culture may be unhealthy for us, might be leading us down a path
away from healthy social interactivity.

Arlene was on the floor with Walker. I was on the couch dreaming,
pondering something that had happened the night before.


Not being able to sleep, I had gone to the bookcase where I keep
my favorite books. There, on the middle shelf, were two by Walker
Percy. I stared at them for a long time before I picked them up, an old
dog-eared paperback of <i>The Moviegoer</i>, his first novel, and a book of
essays, <i>Lost in the Cosmos</i>, one of the few hardbacks I had splurged on
when I was in college. I felt an old thrill looking at the title on the
spine: <i>The Moviegoer</i>. I hadn't had the time to read a book in months.
Years. Almost three years since I'd read a book that didn't have to do
with medical issues or sensitivity. I pulled them off the shelf. A publicity
picture of Percy fell out. There he stood--the guy we'd named
our son after--smiling before the camera in a herringbone sports
jacket, a tie, a black knit vest, smirking as if to say, <i>Does any of it really
matter?</i> Why had this man been Walker's namesake? What kind of a
son had we been hoping for? I asked myself. I remembered, of
course, vividly the sorts of images that came to mind when I
thought of Walker Percy. A medical man. A writer. A thinker. I
imagined a man in his twenties walking through the park, wearing
a sleeveless knit vest, casually toying with the keys in his pocket,
talking intently with his girlfriend or his best pal, dishing jokes
with a straight face, a wry wit.


Now I looked at the picture of Percy again. Is that really who
Percy was? <i>"So you named your son after me?"</i> he seemed to be saying.
<i>"Do you really know who I am anyway? For starters I'm dead. You
named your son after a dead man. A very traditional thing to do at least
in some faiths, your husband's faith. I like that. I think of myself as an honorary
Jewish man--a spiritual wanderer. But the difference is that in your
husband's tradition they name after relatives. But I think I know why: I'm
onto you. You were looking for certification in far-flung places. Trying to fend
off the everydayness, the stench of so many Sunday dinners. Or are you like
me and just have a repulsion to anything associated with yourself? So you
fought your malaise, tried to stake a claim, bucked the old boys."</i>


I guessed he was right. What did Walker have to do with Walker
Percy, a man who was just an author I liked? Yet hadn't there been
a scene from <i>The Moviegoer</i>? A scene when this character Binx (a
thinly veiled version of himself, I suspect) was staring at light, or
looking out the window.

I flipped through and found this:
<blockquote>
<p>
I became bewitched by the presence of the building; for minutes at
a stretch I sat on the floor and watched the motes rise and fall in the
sunlight.
</p>
</blockquote>
... and this ...
<blockquote>
<p>
Not in a thousand years could I explain it to Uncle Jules, but it is
no small thing for me to make a trip, travel hundreds of miles across
the country by night to a strange place and come out where there
is a different smell in the air and people have a different way of
sticking themselves into the world. It is a small thing to him but not
to me ... What will it mean to go moseying down Michigan
Avenue in the neighborhood of five million strangers, each shooting
out his own personal ray? How can I deal with five million personal
rays?

I became bewitched by the presence of the building; for minutes at
a stretch I sat on the floor and watched the motes rise and fall in the
sunlight.


Not in a thousand years could I explain it to Uncle Jules, but it is
no small thing for me to make a trip, travel hundreds of miles across
the country by night to a strange place and come out where there
is a different smell in the air and people have a different way of
sticking themselves into the world. It is a small thing to him but not
to me ... What will it mean to go moseying down Michigan
Avenue in the neighborhood of five million strangers, each shooting
out his own personal ray? How can I deal with five million personal
rays?


I began thinking about the connection between sensitivity and
the artist. It seemed to me that so many artists and writers I had read
about were highly aware of light and smells and textures, sometimes
too sensitive to exist comfortably. W. H. Auden apparently needed a
high degree of deep pressure to calm himself; I had once read that
he pulled rugs off the floor on top of his body in order to sleep (like
kids with autism who squeeze between mattresses at night). Didn't
Thomas Merton also have some visual sensitivities? Hadn't I once
read that when quite young he had a "deep and serious urge to
adore the gas-light in the kitchen with," as he said, "no little ritualistic
veneration"?


But he was a mystic. Was there a connection between not just the
artistic life and sensitivity, but between spirituality and sensitivity? Did
mystics choose a reclusive life for biological, not just spiritual, reasons?


Now, sitting with Arlene, I began to wonder how much of religious
experience was sensory experience. What is the meaning of a symbol if
it isn't in part known by the body? <i>Frankincense, a smell of the divine.
Music, the sound of God, human feeling translated into the auditory. Prayers,
hands moving to the mid-line, to the most centering part of the body, the mouth;
fingers touching lips, touching sense, touching sound, whisper of wishes</i>.

[p. <i>254</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00270&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"You know, you might want to think about yourself."


"What?" I said. I had suddenly awakened from my reverie to
realize that Arlene, who was on the floor gently spinning Walker in
the saucer-shaped disk, was speaking to me. It was the summer of
1999, not far from Walker's third birthday and his final REACH
evaluation. Arlene's hands were on Walker, but her head was now
turned 180 degrees away from Walker, toward me.


"You might want to consider your own sensitivities."


"My own?"


"Yes," she said. "You seem distracted."


Of course she was right. I hadn't been watching her work with
Walker. <i>But didn't Arlene understand that I had worked with Walker all
morning? A person needed some refuge</i>.


"I think," said Arlene, "that toward the end of the session, it's
sometimes difficult for you to notice Walker's needs."


"Walker's needs?" <i>Wasn't I always thinking of Walker's needs?</i>


"What kind?"


"He needs some direction now. We need to find out if he's hungry
or tired."


"So you think I space out too much?"


"You do retreat at times. I've noticed it, noticed it more and more."


<i>Sensitivities ... you mean I might have sensitivities, too?</i>


"Often we tell parents that they might want to look at themselves,"
explained Arlene. "Sometimes the children we are working
with are just exaggerated versions of their parents."


<i>Dam burst. Banks flooding. I was halfway down the river--Walker's river,
Walker's experience--but J must have known, must always have known it
was my river, too</i>....


In the beginning, it hadn't mattered, finally, where Walker's problems
came from. If there was a way to reverse them, reversing was where
our energies must go. Yet now, occasionally, there was time, time to
delve deeper, to go backward into the past, to ask questions about etiology.
New discoveries about autism were burgeoning, appearing
every day, and still are, many of them in the area of genetics.


Twenty years earlier, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dawn and
her colleagues tried to discuss the issue of genetics and autism spectrum
disorder with neurologists and other researchers, yet neurologists

[p. <i>255</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00271&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, of course, Dawn's suspicions proved true; genetics were
indeed a deciding factor in the disorder. (If parents have one child
with autism, their chances of a second child having the disorder rise
from 1 in 500 to 1 in 20.)


The line between pathology and normalcy is a fuzzy one at best
in the world of "the spectrum." Where does it end? Begin?


As geneticists study autism, they are discovering that autism isn't
merely passed down by people with a diagnosis, but it is also passed
down by parents with a few autistic characteristics. Geneticists call
people who do not fit into all the diagnostic criteria "broad autistic
phenotypes."


Time and again when I have been talking to women with children
with autism, I hear a resonant story. I heard nearly the same story
twice from two different mothers who had never met. The couple
goes to a lecture on autism or visits a therapist shortly after their child
receives a diagnosis. The couple learns that people with autism have
systematic minds, like things in certain orders, have trouble with transitions--
that people with autism are not social--that they may be
good with math and music, or they are highly visual. The husband
walks out of the classroom, or office, and says, "My God, they've just
been describing me."


Parents may share strengths associated with the disorder. The popular
press occasionally theorizes that certain individuals celebrated for
their technical genius, but lacking normative social skills, may be on
the spectrum: Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, and even Thomas Jefferson
are among them.

[p. <i>256</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00272&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recent studies reveal that people on the autism spectrum have
superior minds for understanding systems. For this reason an inordinate
number of children with Asperger's syndrome (high-functioning
autism) as well as other kinds of autism are appearing in California's
Silicon Valley, where many parents are programmers. Simon Baron-Cohen,
a clinical psychologist at Cambridge University who studies
individuals with autism and their families, discovered that the parents
of children with autism often share some of their talents, talents that
are often cornerstone gifts associated with the disorder, particularly
their visual strengths. Baron-Cohen says that parents and children
with high-functioning autism are often so good at embedded figure
tests (tests for picking out specific geometrical shapes within a complex
picture) that "you hardly have time to get the experimental
materials out on the table before they've spotted the target." Baron-Cohen
has found a "significant overrepresentation of engineering
among the fathers and grandfathers of children with autism (12
percent, as compared to the 5 percent of engineers in the rest of the
population)."


Cliff in some ways fits the broad autistic phenotype. He has significant
talent in certain areas. He is an architect, has an extremely high aptitude
for math and acute visual awareness. He, like Walker, solves puzzles
easily and has a gift for pattern recognition, and in temperament
he is an introvert. (Is it a coincidence that the last two books I read
on autism were written by mothers of children with autism whose
husbands were architects?)


Maybe such distinctions don't matter. Still, Walker seemed to share
some exaggerated gifts and foibles that Cliff and I both possessed.


Arlene's words were a revelation--they sent me into my own past,
where I started researching and reviewing my own issues with sensory
processing. I was revising, revisiting the question of who I was,
remembering, searching, researching--but remembering now, suddenly
now, with my body.


<i>Memories of my childhood is Southern California are defused with a flooding,
headachy light. In my memory, light mixes with sadness, with a feeling of</i>

[p. <i>257</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00273&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began remembering sensations I craved when I was little. One odd
night I lay in bed and longed to find a scab to scratch off. I loved the
feeling of resistance that pulling off scabs gave my skin, loved the
tearing feeling around my skin--the sensation of unusual resistance
somehow made me feel more alive. I also used to bite my arms.
When we sat in the back of the station wagon on long trips, I bit my
arm hard, studied the teeth marks. Afterward, I sucked on my skin
and let the fine hairs tickle my lips. Dad used to say, "You weren't
meant for this world, Patsy. Neither was I." It suddenly occurred to
me that he too might have a sensitive nervous system. Perhaps the
whole family did.


One day, during this time, Cliff and I attended a choral concert. On
the way home I was tense, distracted. Cliff wanted to know if anything
was wrong. For the first time in my life, I looked first to my
"sensory system" to see if anything was amiss. I felt a subtle, uncomfortable
energy in my body, a slight headache, a barely perceptible
metallic humming sensation in my ears. I looked back over the experience
listening to the concert and realized that about halfway
through the second half, I had actually turned inward. I had no
memory of the second set of pieces, either visual or aural, though I
could recall many details from the first half of the concert. Something
about the pitch of the high voices, or perhaps the sheer quantity of
music I had been exposed to, or maybe the acoustics--the reverberations
of the voices resounding of!" the walls of the high cathedral
where we sat on hard pews--something had sent me into an internal
world, a dreamy state.


At the end of the concert, I left to find the ladies room, having told
Cliff I'd meet him at the front of the cathedral. I wandered downstairs
through an Escheresque labyrinth of halls looking for the bathroom.
On the way, details emerged from the Gothic wood-paneled walls--

[p. <i>258</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00274&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the way home I could barely talk. Eventually Cliff asked if I
were all right. Was it him? "Well, yes." I challenged. "Where were you?"


Cliff was silent.


I tried my best to apologize. Yet I couldn't sustain an interest in conversation
for the rest of the evening. I was irritable and couldn't concentrate
well until after a full night's sleep.


I began to consider how simple exchanges that happen every day
between people who are close--or trying to be--can be difficult
between people who are sensitive in different ways. So often, people
and children with sensitivities are challenged to be present when "the
show"--their show--may really be happening internally.


The first few years of his life, I was perplexed by the paradox that is
Walker. How, for instance, could a child who can barely stand to be
touched not be bothered by a vaccination shot? How could a child
who bumped up hard against us at bedtime also cry and ask to go

[p. <i>259</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00275&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The answer is that people can be hyposensitive and hypersensitive
at the same time. Going backward into my life, I began to
understand that I have indeed been both hypersensitive and
hyposensitive. As an adult with children, I could barely stand
attending a concert, could not function well in the grocery store.
Yet when I was in high school, I surrounded myself with people. I
went to movies, watched television, could barely stand the silence
that sometimes used to creep in from my own internal wanderings,
often could not tolerate the quiet of reading.


It had been dim in the living room with Walker when he was an
eight-month-old baby and I was learning floor time. I feared tedium.
I was afraid it would be boring at first in the way that boredom
can seem almost frightening. I knew my encounters with
Walker would have to "be me"--if not about me, at least from
me--our connection would have to be inspired from some inside
energy that I might possess. I was scared I didn't have it.


My friends tell me now that I had receded, that I had been hard
to reach. I was thinking all the time. I had unzipped a door and
entered an airless chamber that included only Walker and me and
his illness. I went into the dark room and seemed to somehow enter
Walker. Was I joining his world? Was it the only way to bring him
out, I wondered now, like Orpheus going to the underworld to
retrieve Euridice?


The phone was off the hook. There would be no retreating to
thought, to music or books. My husband was at his office, Elizabeth
was miles away with friends. Yet with Walker in those dark rooms
on the hottest of summer days, I realize, I had found a stillness, a
calmness to my nervous system I might never have come to know
as an adult. What entered, at least during certain moments, was a
quiet I can't remember having experienced before--something that
I may have been longing for and working to cover over, a stillness
gone unheard.

[p. <i>260</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976811-I00276&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Walker's plight began to teach our family that the Golden Rule can
be meretricious, a deception. We didn't need to do for each other as
we would have done for ourselves--that wreaks havoc and misunderstanding.
Instead, we started seeing that each individual likes to be
"done to" individually. We are becoming a closer family for relating
to each other through the senses, so to speak, knowing each other
first as sensory beings.


On an escalator in a department store, I put my arm around
Elizabeth. "Mom, would you not do that?" she complained.


"What?" I said.


She flung my arm off. "Don't touch me."


"Really, you don't want me to touch you?" I said.


"I do. I do. It's just, you put too much weight on me. Try it
lighter." I put my hand on her.


"No. No. No. That's too light, it tickles." I relaxed, leaned my head
in toward her.


"Perfect," she said.


We all began to grow more gentle, tentative, and watchful with
each other. We learned to recognize contrasts and similarities in the
yearnings of our separate nervous systems. Cliff likes jazz. I find it too
stimulating. There are times when I feel like "mixing it up"
(Greenspan's term) and (Tiff feels like being calm. Greenspan taught
us to read the signs, to be as sensitive with each other as we might be
with Walker, to play to one another's moods. Greenspan taught us that
playing to the nervous system of a loved one is a matter of being
mindful and watchful. Perhaps it is like courting the trust of a deer or
a bird. We peek first from behind the tree.
