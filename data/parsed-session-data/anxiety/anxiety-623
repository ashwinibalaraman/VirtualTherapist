<i><b>I</b></i>n the fall of 1961, my family moved to Washington, D.C. We
all attended my father's swearing-in ceremony and a reception
at the White House. We stood in a receiving line to meet
President Kennedy, the first lady, and the vice president, who took
my hands in his large ones and leaned down to murmur, "How do
you do, my little cottontailed bunny rabbit?" I wore a black-and-white
checked shirtwaist with oversized pink rosette buttons that
my mother had ordered from the "chubbette" section of the Sears
catalogue. We ate petits fours, and my brother was forced to dance
with me as the Marine Band played "The Syncopated Clock."


For a year my family sublet a furnished split-level at the end of a
cul-de-sac in Bethesda, Maryland. The decor was Danish modern;
the walls were painted unfamiliar colors like teal blue and olive
green, the floors covered with wall-to-wall shag carpet. The place
had an impersonal, fitted-out feeling, as if the rooms had all been
furnished with one day's shopping. I was anxious for my mother the

I overheard my father speculating that our neighbor on the
right was a "spook"--worked for the CIA--and when I remember
that man's pallor and his haunted eyes as he went about his yard
chores, my father's remark makes sense. Across the street was a
family of Cuban emigres with three teenaged daughters who
trawled the neighborhood for makeover candidates; every weekend
they appeared at our door, begging my mother for permission
to curl my eyelashes and set my hair on rollers.


All over the development new houses were going up; the whine
of saws and the thud of hammers were constant, and the smell of
fresh lumber and paint was everywhere. But the circle of houses at
the end of this cul-de-sac was still surrounded by woods, and once
again I reverted to my old pattern of wandering in them. The Maryland
woods were dense, prickly, and unwelcoming, full of tangled
vines and poisonous plants, a different proposition from the benign
New England woods I knew.


I followed a bulldozer track one hot Saturday afternoon, and
to my surprise I stumbled upon a wide, slow-flowing river. I took
off my clothes and waded in from the muddy bank, floated on my
back, gazing up at a patch of milky sky through a cone of converging
tree trunks. I knew this was a risky and slightly perverse thing I
was doing, very much in keeping with the feeling of these rank
southern woods, and also with the bold and careless depredations
of the redneck men who drove the earth-moving behemoths that

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother enrolled me in the local public junior high, where I felt
more conspicuously freakish than ever before. This was an accurate
judgment; in my corduroy jumper and orthopedic oxfords, I was
now objectively and unmistakably a misfit. I was surrounded by girls
who carried ratting combs and cans of hair spray in their purses.
They wore pastel flats and panty hose and skirts hemmed three
inches above the knee, and even one of them seemed to have
enlisted a boy to steer and pivot her through the halls, one hand flattened
on the small of her back.


How did these girls manage their immaculate self-presentation?--by
spending ten minutes before and after every class in the
ladies' room. They packed the space in front of the mirror, the highstatus
girls in the first rank, the rest standing on tiptoe and craning
their necks, applying mascara, covering blemishes with dots of foundation,
tweaking, rubbing, and smoothing their faces into an acceptable
condition. There was real discipline in this vigilant self-maintenance.
And there was camaraderie in the girls' collective and
competitive self-deprecation; they groaned about puffiness, shine,
enlarged pores. One bold and popular girl even drew attention to
her facial hair problem. No, the others cried. We can't see a thing!
Look closely, she said, pointing to her upper lip. This is where I have

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I saw immediately that this new school was an untenable situation
for me, and my solution was the usual one. Whenever possible,
I simply walked away from the bus stop into the woods, or, alternatively,
I would sometimes continue down the road a few miles to
Glen Echo Amusement Park--the scene of a recent and soon-to-become
notorious race riot--where I would spend the day reading
and people-watching at a wooden table outside one of the food concessions.
This escape was feasible only three days a week, because
on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons my mother picked me up at
school and drove me to the office of my new therapist, Dr. H, the
knitter.


This is how I remember the mother of my adolescence, the woman
behind the wheel in sunglasses and a scarf, her face unreadable in
profile, her pale arms covered with an odd growth of long downy
hair--how I noticed every change in her aging, and how critical I
was! In New York my mother had been thrown off balance and
made vulnerable; in suburban Maryland she retreated into
inaccessibility.


This was the mother of the long silences, driving from errand to
errand. All through the years in Washington, I sat with her as she
waited to make left turns, impatiently shaking one cigarette after
another from the pack she kept on the dashboard--my parents
smoked Kents now, no longer the filterless Lucky Strikes of the

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. Striker, my home economics teacher, was often a good conversational
gambit. My mother enjoyed my anecdotes about this
woman, with her two bright spots of rouge and her resolute cheeriness,
who taught us to make a sandwich without ever touching the
bread or the filling, and instructed us in proper conversational etiquette
at the table--no discussion of politics or religion or any controversial
topic that might interfere with digestion. I had heard my
mother repeating Striker stories to my father during the cocktail
hour. Sometimes a new one--I was not above inventing them--
would raise a smile, other times not.


My mother dropped me off in front of Dr. H's Georgetown brownstone.
I made my way around the side of the house along a twisting
brick pathway through an overgrown rose garden to the three
stone steps that led down to her basement office. This approach
always made me think of a fairy tale, an impression maintained
when Dr. H opened the door to her tiny waiting room and beckoned
me into her dark, cozy, smoky office.


She was a short, solid, sweet-faced woman with a graying braid
wrapped around her head, Tyrolean style. It was months before I
was able to retrieve the image that the sight of her evoked; finally I
realized she looked like a composite of the "wives" from my illustrated
Grimm's fairy tales--the woodcutter's wife, the fisherman's
wife, the tinker's wife, a woman rendered in different costumes

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The silence in Dr. H's office was nearly as absolute as the
silence in Dr. V's, but its tonal coloration was very different. I felt
far more comfortable here, partly because I was now a veteran of
what I understood to be psychoanalysis and I knew the drill: You
came in, you lay down, you got up again when prompted at the
end of the hour, and anything else was optional. But I also felt at
home in this little cluttered basement room, where boxes of files
were heaped in corners and books were piled knee-high around
Dr. H's sagging chenille-covered armchair. I was in the presence
of a fellow slob, and I liked that, but even more I liked the feeling
of huddling in a warm untidy nest underground, a kind of spiritual
root cellar.


Dr. H's knitting project got under way a few months after I began
to come to her office. One day she startled me by following me to
the couch. Before I had a chance to recline, she sat down next to me
and presented me with a book of sweater patterns. Choose something,
she said, in her flat midwestern accent; I'd like to knit a
sweater for you, and when I peered at her incredulously, she smiled
and nodded reassuringly. I flipped through the pages of the book,
casting quick side-glances in her direction. Her proximity made me
nervous and a little queasy; I was conscious of her wheezy breathing,
and even though I lived with smokers, and was becoming a part-time
smoker myself, I noticed the staleness of the odor that rose from
her clothes. I looked through the book unseeingly--how could the

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I had a chance to object, Dr. H quickly and deftly measured
me, across the shoulders and from shoulder to wrist. By the
end of our next meeting she had produced a square of sweater the
size of a placemat, and her needles worked steadily through the sessions.
Given what I could see of her daily production rate, it seemed
strange that the sweater grew so slowly over the weeks and months of
my therapy: Was it possible that she unraveled it after hours, like
Penelope? And what about her other patients? Did she keep a bag of
knitting for each one of them as well, or was I somehow a special
case?


I began to look forward to these restful sessions; in the half-lit
quiet, my thoughts ordered themselves around the aural focal point
of Dr. H's softly click-clacking needles. After a few months I became
an adept of sorts; moments after I hit the couch, I was able to lower
myself into a state of deep relaxation, fully alert but so heavy-limbed
that I felt paralyzed. I saw myself as resting in a shallow bath of
reverie, like a fish gently poaching in my mother's <i>bain-marie</i>, in liquid
"barely to cover."

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When my therapy with Dr. H ended in the spring--why it stopped
I had no idea; I could only guess it was because the sweater was finished--she
presented it to me. It was very handsome and unbecoming
and smelled ever after of Dr. H's Pall Malls.


The following fall I was sent back to Williamstown to boarding
school. My parents never mentioned it, but I knew that Dr. H had
advised them to get me out of public school. I had felt the presence
of her unseen hand earlier that winter, when the school bureaucracy
caught up with my frequent absences. My parents' reaction to
the note from the principal was eerily muted and nonjudgmental;
even my father held his tongue. I could see now that, among other
things, therapy could always be used as a retreat, a punishment-free
zone.


It was an odd sensation to be sent home to school. I think perhaps
my mother was acting on a primitive wish that the town might
continue to protect me as it had when I was small. But the school sat
up on a hill at the end of a long and unfamiliar driveway; I felt as far
removed there from the scenes of my early childhood as I would
have felt in Washington--farther perhaps, because physical proximity
only seemed to sharpen the sense of temporal distance. On the
few occasions when I got a chance to walk along College Place, I
saw a new and unfamiliar pack of faculty brats running and shouting
through the yards. The two houses in which I had spent my early
childhood looked sturdily unchanged, and they seemed to stand
away, regarding me with an air of innocent reproach.


Flagstone School was small and progressive, co-directed by the
wealthy and eccentric Mrs. R, then in her seventies, and Ned, a man
in his forties with a bulbous nose and a habit of wearing Harris
tweeds, a cultivated Anglophile whose brusquely cheerful manner
masked a complex and difficult personality. The school had a vague

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can remember by heart many passages from my first Flagstone
"report letter" (no grades were given). Ned wrote a kind of preamble,
and even then I could see that he took pleasure in exercising his
prose style, and also in the sense that he had "discovered" me. "I
must confess to finding Emily a pure delight," he began, going on to
describe my immaturity, my habit of wearing my clothes inside out,
my "intensity"--"for Emily is <i>very</i> intense"--my "remarkable
mind," and my ongoing failure to realize its potential. He also mentioned
my tendency, when not sure of my facts, to "bull" my way
through class discussion. I wasn't quite sure what to make of the arch
tone of this assessment, its disconcerting combination of fulsome
praise and campy disparagement, but I felt quite sure that it would
please my mother, and it did.


My two years at Flagstone were relatively happy; I made
friends, improved academically, and found a patient and attentive
personal adviser in my elderly French teacher, Mr. Sears, who listened
to me talk for half an hour every Saturday morning in a
quiet corner of the teacher's smoking room. My roommates gave
me a few blunt lessons in personal hygiene.


By trading on my quick tongue and my flair for imitations, I even
achieved a measure of popularity. But I was also repeatedly caught
in rules infractions--smoking in unsanctioned areas and sneaking
off campus. Once I accepted a dare from my roommates to meet a
Williams student, a Ugandan, in the basement of Lehman Hall,
where I used to climb the fire escape as a child.


This man was in his thirties; he owned a coffee plantation in

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My roommates had secreted themselves just outside the basement's
rear entrance. When the Ugandan student heard their
incompetently suppressed giggles and realized he had been set up,
he burst into an indignant tirade, surely as much an expression of his
disappointed loneliness and cultural dislocation as anything else.
Under cover of that explosion I shot out of the basement and ran,
followed by my roommates, all of us laughing and gasping for
breath, until we collapsed in high grass behind the college library.


I worked the incident into a comic routine, rendering the Ugandan's
outburst in Oxbridge-accented burp-talk. This was overheard
by a faculty member, or perhaps another student informed on me.
In any event, the story was extracted from me, and I was suspended
for a week, a punishment far less severe than the sad, surprised look
in Mr. Sears's eyes when we met for our weekly talk. Soon after my
return to school, my roommates and I were caught smoking on the
roof, and I was expelled. Why was I the one to be singled out, I asked
Ned and Mrs. R as I stood before them in the firelit, wood-paneled
faculty lounge. Why me and not my roommates, who in every case
had been equally guilty? The explanation: Tricia and Caroline had
come to Flagstone as shy and overly conscientious girls for whom a
little wild behavior actually represented a developmental step
<i>toward</i> maturity, rather than away from it. In their case it was appropriate
or the school administration to look the other way.

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the time I was thrown out of Flagstone, my sister had gone away
to college, and my parents had made the move to official Washington;
now they and my brother lived in the embassy district in a town-house
where they were able to entertain on a large scale. This house
was stringently vertical, stifling in summer and unevenly heated in
winter. The first of its four floors was a tiled entryway; on the second
my parents entertained guests. New and alienatingly formal furnishings
came to rest in the living room--a pair of sofas upholstered in
beige velvet, matching club chairs, small glass-and-rattan-topped
tables, two grim brass urns flanking the fireplace, filled with silk
flowers and gilt seed-pods, a tall Japanese screen painted with long-legged,
pink-eyed water birds in black and gold. My family lived on
the third and fourth floors; this was where the familiar and comfortable
odds and ends of Williamstown furniture were kept.


Many times I came home at dinnertime to find a hired man in a
starched white shirt and black vest stationed at the door. I got used
to making my sullen and embarrassed way through the rustling, fragrant
ranks of a crowd of strangers, my mother calling out, "You
remember Emmy, don't you?" I learned to grab handfuls of hors
d'oeuvres to take with me to my room on the fourth floor; the route
to the kitchen was always blocked by knots of jabbering guests, and
even if I made the effort to reach it, I knew I would find it taken over
by an occupying army of caterers.


My mother enrolled me in the Edgar Allen Poe School. This
was an extraordinary institution, exponentially weirder than Flagstone.
It was housed in a soon-to-be-condemned Victorian house in
northwest Washington, surrounded by an overgrown yard strewn
with cigarette butts and broken glass. The directors were Alex O. and
his wife, a visionary named Dorothy.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Alex was the front man; in spite of a missing molar that was
apparent only when he smiled, he was presentable, and he gave off
a reassuringly Ivy League air. Dorothy was the moving spirit of the
place. I can see her now, a former field hockey star and debutante, a
stocky woman in her late thirties with a rolling, athletic walk, making
her way through the narrow halls of the school, her squarish,
slightly trembling hands wrapped tightly around a coffee mug. She
wore a soiled trench coat and penny loafers without socks; her scanty
hair was pulled back tightly into a greasy ponytail. Her face--it can
best be described as a slightly feminized version of William F. Buckley,
Jr.'s; she had the same pinched nostrils and blazing blue eyes--
was perpetually alight with enthusiasm.


When my mother and I arrived for my interview, we stepped
over and around several installments of a dead crow on the front
sidewalk. My mother must have been appalled by the condition of
the school and by the condition of Dorothy as well, but placement
had become a problem; there were few schools that would
have me now.


But soon it was apparent that Poe would, because in her hoarse,
whispery voice, Dorothy immediately launched into a sales pitch.
The Poe school was not a conventional kind of place, she told us,
nor was it a loose Summerhillian experiment. It was a rigorous academic
environment where kids of all kinds were exposed, perhaps
for the first time, to real intellectual inquiry. She and Alex and the
staff worked very hard to give the kids the opportunity to learn in
new, fresh ways. They did their best to help kids UNLEARN (as she
warmed to her recruiting task, she began to speak in capitalized
words and phrases) the old, stale lessons of the pedagogical past. On
any given day, she said, throwing her arms out in an all-encompassing
gesture, all kinds of EXCITING THINGS were going on around

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I glanced at my mother and saw that in spite of herself, she was
impressed. Sophisticated though she was, there was still something
of the credulous clubwoman in my mother, something of her own
mother, and this part of my mother was looking at Dorothy and
struggling to see past the blackened fingernails and unshaven legs,
to look beyond these appearances to the devoted educator, so passionately
committed that she had little time for personal grooming.
And of course, my mother was also wishing that I might, as Dorothy
promised, "burst into bloom." Even now it causes me some pain to
admit that however remote my mother became, she never stopped
suffering on my behalf.


I stayed at Poe for three years, repeating tenth grade. I soon
found my place among the large group of students whose parents
used Poe as a sort of loose corral, without much hope that their children
would learn anything. I dropped in on classes that interested
me--I was intrigued by Dorothy's course in the pre-Socratics--but
I spent most of my time smoking in the weed-choked courtyard with
a large group of fellow truants-in-residence. Sometimes Alex, whose
daily job was to police the school and eject interlopers, would step
out of his office and order us inside, but not often.


What I managed not to learn in high school sits firmly atop the
foundation of what I had managed not to learn in junior high and
elementary school. Taken together, it makes an impressive syllabus:

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As an adult, I've spent a lot of anxious energy steering conversations
around the holes in my general knowledge. Until I was well
into my thirties, for example, it never occurred to me to examine my
assumption that the Belgian Congo was located in Belgium. I was in
my forties when I noticed that on a map, north is up and south is
down. I've been enrolled almost continuously in undergraduate and
graduate college programs, but I never retain much; whatever I pour
into myself seems to leak out, leaving deposits of passive knowledge
that I can't bring to consciousness with any reliability. In the past ten
years, when I've begun to write in earnest, I've discovered that for
me the key to retrieval is writing. But even this is outside the realm
of my will; in the turbulence of composition, words and facts and
paragraphs of quotation that I don't remember ever having learned
come swirling up spontaneously into my consciousness.


Something about my brain is nonstandard; I seem to be good at
thinking but bad at learning. Is it possible that in some cases thinking
is inimical to learning? I don't blame my parents or my teachers
for the failure of my education, and I can't entirely blame myself
either, though I know I was lazy as well as learning-disabled. But I do

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I learned that the only way to break the back of her frantic indignation
was to begin to cry; at this point she would make the longed-for
rhetorical turn, acknowledge that we'd reached bedrock and that
perhaps I could now pick myself up and make another effort. She
would clap her square hand onto my shoulder and walk me out of
her office, pausing in the doorway to look up at me--she was rather
short--with a tremulous smile. This was my cue to declare my good
intentions and to be released.


On the afternoon that Kennedy was assassinated, school was dismissed
early. I came home to the bewildering sight of my father,
who never left his office in the middle of the day, standing on the
sidewalk in his shirtsleeves and stocking feet. Tears were coursing
down his face, and he was clutching my brother, who had just
arrived home himself, to his chest. This was the first time I had
ever seen him weep.


Obviously he had been waiting for us, looking to offer comfort or
to receive it. As I approached, he beckoned and extended an arm.
He pulled me to him and got my head into a kind of half nelson,
pressing me against the half of his unfamiliar chest that wasn't occupied
by Andy. He was vibrating with sobs, and I noticed that Andy,
always loyal and good-hearted, was crying softly too. I found I could
not respond to my father's embrace, and I allowed my arms to hang

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not even for the thirty seconds that this three-way clinch lasted
could I keep my thoughts from returning to the school courtyard
where I had been sitting in the high grass just before voices began
shouting the news from Dallas. I had been reading a poem a boy had
handed me a few minutes earlier. One quick furtive skim had
already shown me that this poem had nothing to do with me or love
or anything immediately gratifying, but the distinction of having
being asked to read it was enough to send me into physiological
overdrive. My heart was banging; perspiration trickled down my
inner arms. On a first reading I found the poem obscure; already I
was running through possible responses--could I register some kind
of appreciation without betraying my lack of understanding?


I was nearly sixteen now, and Eros had me in his grip. I was still
hefty, but I had lengthened, and on my best days I managed to stay
on the right side of the line that divides the attractive from the unfortunate.
I had grown my hair long, and I washed and ironed it every
morning; by noon my scalp had generated enough oil to turn my
bangs into vision-impairing spikes. My days were full of sweaty lyricism;
I had begun to leave Poe at lunchtime to spend my afternoons
at Dupont Circle, where bongos and flutes were played under the
trees and improvisational dances were performed.


On New Year's Eve, a few months after Kennedy's assassination, I
was dragged out of an unauthorized and unchaperoned party by
my father. At two o'clock in the morning, he tracked me to a
house in suburban Maryland and found me with a boy--the same
one who had given me the poem. This boy and I had been sitting

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Hey!" shouted the boy. "Wait a minute!" But my father was
already frog-marching me through the rooms of the party, which
emptied as we advanced. When we reached the front door, I made
an attempt to wrestle myself free, but my father pushed me to the
ground and dragged me by one ankle down the gravel driveway to
the car. This was the first time my father had ever been physically
rough with me (and the last). I was shrieking; my skirt was rucked up
around my waist, exposing my underpants, and I felt a magnificent
explosion of outrage and vindication in my chest. I was right, I told
myself. I was innocent and good and finally this thing was happening
that would prove I always had been.


He gathered me up and heaved me into the backseat. My
mother sat silently in the front. I rolled onto the car floor--I was
seriously drunk, and so, I would guess, was my father--where I lay
mumbling, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you." When my parents
had gotten me home, my mother examined my gravel-scraped leg
and ran a bath for me. While she was out of the bathroom for a
moment, I broke a jar of aspirin in the sink, and in a rapture of
anger I took a shard of glass and scratched my wrist hard enough
to draw a little blood.


Everything about Dr. G's office breathed legitimacy--the boxy
red brick building that housed it, the two big windows looking out
across Connecticut Avenue to the trees of the Washington Zoo,
the two armchairs that sat in the light of those windows, facing
one another at a comfortable angle across a small oriental rug, the
discreet placement of the analytic couch some yards away, the

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What I realized instantly when Dr. G stood facing me in his
waiting room, looking into my eyes with his sober, clear-eyed gaze,
was that we had met before. Apparently he had failed to remember,
but just a few weeks before our first session I had been in his house.
That, in fact, was where the New Year's Eve that ended with the
explosion had begun.


Dr. G and his wife were the hosts of an Italian exchange student
who attended my school, a well-behaved and very European girl
called Mimi (and what must she have made of Poe and Dorothy?).
This Mimi, who was a good student with independent intellectual
interests, had invited me and some others to a small New Year's Eve
gathering.


I saw right away that this was a dull party; the guests had been
drawn mostly from the small group of academic self-starters who followed
Dorothy as she trucked through the halls of the school conducting
ambulatory seminars. These were the kids who had incorporated
her characteristic phrases into their own vocabularies, who
spoke of "making order of the chaos of our sense perceptions" and
"seeing it new." Only a few members of my wilder set were there,
and we rolled our eyes at one another ironically; an exchange student
like Mimi could hardly be expected to understand the gaffe she
had committed by inviting us to a gathering of Dorothy devotees.


In the background, an Edith Piaf record played softly. We sat
around a flagstone fireplace drinking mulled cider and eating Italian

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had just begun to maneuver myself toward the door and the
two friends who had stationed themselves there, ready to make
their escape, when the man I was later to know as Dr. G leaned
into the room. He was wearing a tan corduroy shirt and leather
slippers. A pair of half-glasses rested on his nose, and a section of
the <i>New York Times</i> was tucked under his elbow. "Ah," said Mimi,
turning to him with a delighted smile. "Let me introduce..." and
she carefully pronounced each of our names, first and last, while
Dr. G moved around the room shaking hands, a weary, relaxed
professional man at home. Having greeted the guests, he withdrew,
but not before pausing at the threshold of the room to wish
everyone a Happy New Year.


Moments later my two friends and I were packed into the front
seat of a station wagon, lighting our cigarettes, driving toward
Bethesda and the real party. Now the evening was over, and the
night of cascading migrations from house to snowy-roofed suburban
house, empty of parents, softly blinking with blue Christmas
lights and thudding with rock-'n'-roll bass, had begun.


I never told Dr. G that I had been in his home. The fifteen seconds
in which I might have spontaneously blurted out that information
was already past when I rose from my chair in the waiting

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When we were seated he spoke. I gather there are some problems
at home, he said. After a moment spent registering the twin
novelties of sitting upright and being openly addressed, I said yes,
my father had gotten very angry at me. I braced myself for the
questions about particulars I assumed would follow. I was young
enough to assume that I would be required to confess all the
details of the make-out session my father had interrupted, and to
feel mortified at the prospect. I was also anticipating the problem
of what I would say if Dr. G demanded an account of the
evening's beginning; I made a provisional plan to blur the details
with vagueness and to resort to a lie only if pressed.


But Dr. G took another tack. I'm going to ask you some questions
that I ask every new patient, he said, and he read rapidly
through a medical/psychological checklist. Did I suffer from frequent
stomach pain? Headaches? Sleeplessness? Was I, on a regular
basis, a little bit sad? Somewhat sad? Very sad? Did I experience hallucinations?
Did I believe enemies were trying to harm me? Did I
hear voices? No. No. No. Somewhat. No. No. No. These were easy
questions, and I was beginning to be lulled by the perfunctory tone
in which Dr. G was reading them off. But toward the end of the list

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I hedged. Sort of, I said, and Dr. G shot me a keenly inquiring
look. I'm not sure if it really was, I said, and I went on to describe
the episode, which I half assumed my mother had already told him
about. (And perhaps, it occurred to me, she had, and Dr. G was
feigning ignorance in order to elicit as much of the story from me as
he could.) Dr. G put his clipboard aside and reached for a note-book.
I found myself slowing the pace of my speech, as if I were dictating
this maundering account to a secretary. Eventually I ground
to a confused halt, and sat in silence while Dr. G completed his
notes.


He looked up once again, and it seemed we were on to something
else. How about school? he asked. How are things going there?
Not so great, I said, with a self-conscious smile and a self-deprecating
shrug. You seem bright, said Dr. G. You test bright. What do you
think is the problem?


I tested bright. This could only mean that what I had vaguely
feared for years was true. That blue folder resting on Dr. G's chairside
table, under his small hand with its slender curled fingers and
thick white-gold wedding band--I felt sure it contained the results
of the tests the psychologist in North Adams had administered to me
when I was eight. These numbers had been following me from therapist

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the other hand, if I tested bright, this meant I <i>was</i> bright. I
had been tried, and found not to be wanting. The chill I had felt
at the sight of the blue folder became a suffusion of warmth, and I
saw the object as an almost magically powerful talisman. I looked
at the bound volumes on Dr. G's shelves, and it seemed almost
plausible that the contents of the blue folder might be incorporated
into a sympathetic article somewhere in those pages: Emily
Gordon, it would begin, a young girl with a high IQ and troubles
at home, was seen in the offices of Dr. G...


My sister owns a photograph of my father and President Johnson in
Johnson's office at the Johnson ranch in Texas, taken in 1964 over
the Christmas holiday. The president is wearing jeans and a flannel
shirt. His feet, in cowboy boots, are propped on his desk. He is
squinting fiercely at a document of some kind, and my father, by
then director of the budget, is standing on one side of the desk in
profile, wearing a dark suit and a tie, looking characteristically
exhausted and uncharacteristically deferential.


That great prosthetic memory, the Internet, has retrieved for me
an article from the July 24, 1964, issue of <i>Time</i> magazine. Under the
heading "More Tightfisted," my father is described as having "quietly
emerged as one of Washington's rising powers" and as a man
who "already has more personal contact with Johnson than anyone
outside of his inner staff." My father's close relationship with Johnson,
said <i>Time</i>, "developed within 24 hours of the Kennedy assassination
when the matter of finishing up the fiscal 1965 budget was
pressing." My father and the president worked together for what

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was too self-absorbed to have registered any of this at the
time, but now I can't help finding it striking that those thirty-seven
days and nights fell between November 3 and December 31. This
information supports my sense that immediately after his startling
collapse into tears on the news of Kennedy's death, my father disappeared
into the Washington maw for good. Only in moments of
extremity--and his behavior that New Year's Eve, I can see now,
must have been influenced by the accumulated strain of those
thirty-seven days--did he reveal anything more than glimpses of
his subjectivity.


In Williamstown the cocktail hour had been observed casually and
intermittently--a drink or two in the kitchen while children flowed
in and out with questions to be answered and disputes to be resolved.
In Washington it evolved into an institution. Every night when my
father was home for dinner, it was convened in the upstairs living
room, across the carpeted landing from my parents' large chilly bedroom
with its high double windows that looked out across Wyoming
Avenue into a similar set of windows on the third floor of the Kuwaiti
embassy. My mother carried a tray up from the kitchen, laden with
two squat, heavy-bottomed old-fashioned glasses filled with ice, a
bowl of raw vegetables, and a smaller bowl of kosher salt in which to
dip them. Sometimes the tray also held cheese and crackers or a tub
of my mother's chicken liver pate, but these additions grew rarer
after my father was discovered to have high cholesterol. My father
poured the drinks--bourbon for him, a martini for her--out of bottles
kept in a small antique wooden cabinet my mother had stripped
and refinished years earlier in Williamstown.

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother excused herself after half an hour to attend to dinner.
My father measured another jigger and a half of bourbon into his
glass and settled down to read the paper and watch the news. Downstairs
in the kitchen, my mother replenished her drink, but she
poured freehand, and by the time we all sat down at the table she
was often quite drunk. This was nothing subtle; she swayed in her
chair, missed the glass when she poured herself wine. My brother
and I did our best to ignore these symptoms and to hope that on this
evening the moment wouldn't arrive when my father would sigh
harshly and rise to his feet, hoist my mother out of her chair, and
help her up the stairs, where he would leave her propped on her
chaise longue with a blanket over her knees, then retire to his study,
to work at his desk until eleven.


I made a point of arriving for my appointments with Dr. G exactly
on time. On the few occasions when I got there five minutes early, I
invariably walked into the waiting room to encounter my classmate
Tamara Federman, the fat blinking girl with the bald spot, being dismissed
from her session. I once caught a glimpse of Dr. G, standing
halfway between his chair and the partially open door, waiting for
Tamara to disappear from view before closing it, looking blank but
alert, like an empty cruising cab with its on-duty sign lit.


Tamara's parents were Eastern Europeans of some kind--it was
typical of my general incuriosity that I never wondered which country
they came from--and she spoke with a faint accent. She was
miserably shy; at lunchtime she sat by herself in a corner of the
courtyard, hunched over a brisket sandwich, her jaws working
steadily and her eyes darting furtively. Once, the legend went, a
group of boys got into her locker before lunch and substituted a
dead bird for the meat in her sandwich. I lowered my eyes as she

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was nearly as uncomfortable about my failure to mention
Tamara to Dr. G as I had been about my failure to mention the fact
of my presence in his house. I saw that I was shirking my responsibility
as a patient; by then I was beginning to understand that to
make these kinds of disclosures and to examine their meaning
would amount to working through resistance--the essential metabolic
process of psychotherapy.


What I never acknowledged to myself as I fixed on the withholding
of those two pieces of information was that I had also made
many other, far more significant omissions. I never told Dr. G, for
example, that over the months my mother was drinking more
steadily and in greater quantities; that she was drunk at dinner nearly
every night, even on those increasingly frequent ones when my
father was not at home and there was no cocktail hour to provide
cover for her drinking; that Andy and I sat through meals in silent
bewilderment as she poked ineffectually at her plate, her fork
deployed at an awkward flat angle that made it impossible to spear
food efficiently, then gave up on eating altogether, pushed her plate
away, and fumblingly lit a cigarette.


I never told him how behavior that once had been episodic was
now nearly constant; my mother increasingly was spending her
days as a semirecluse, lying on the chaise in her bedroom. I sometimes
heard her coughing as I passed her door on my way up the
stairs to my room. "Come in," she would call out softly when I
knocked, and I would find her reclining in a pool of lamplight, her
Peter De Vries novel open on her lap, smiling mistily and holding
out an affectionate hand, greeting me with an odd, theatrical air of

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I also never told him about my father's peculiar blinkered way of
dealing with my mother's slow-motion collapse--how one night, for
example, he encountered me on the stair landing and gestured me
into his study. "Look," he whispered, opening his jacket to reveal a
paper bag full of my mother's prescription medications. "I'm going
to keep these in here for a while," he said, "just to be on the safe
side." I stood and watched, speechless with confusion and astonishment,
while my father stashed the bag in the back of his file drawer.
This dissociated craftiness seemed so unlike my formidably rational
father, so out of touch with what he must have believed to be the
seriousness of the situation. Was my mother addicted to these pills?
Was she suicidal? And if so, were these matters to be handled in
such a childish way? And why me? My father rarely even spoke to
me anymore. Why was I the one chosen for the wink and nudge?


Why did I omit to mention any of this to Dr. G? Perhaps I was "in
denial," as present-day conventional wisdom about the families of
alcoholics would have it, but I don't think this explanation quite
applies (though it fits my father's behavior quite neatly). I was very
young then, and the world was younger too; I knew that therapy represented
a punishment-free zone, but I hadn't yet come to the liberating
realization that it was also an arena in which I could rat on my
parents with impunity. Dr. G and my parents lived in the world of
adults--that alone was enough to make them seem natural allies.
And the atmosphere of Dr. G's office held a certain authority and
clarity that I could not help associating with my father--both men
could, after all, be loosely classified as social scientists.


I think also that I was responding to an imperative of adolescence,
the self-preserving need to stay partially cocooned, to

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In an apparent effort to jump-start the therapeutic process, Dr. G
began to interrupt my reveries. This was a novelty, and not entirely
a welcome one. I missed the restfulness of Dr. V's and Dr. H's
offices, where the silence was principled and predictable. In Dr. G's
office it was also the rule (except for the first few sessions, when he
spoke more than he did in all the later ones put together), but one
he allowed himself to override. The pressure to make progress--
whatever that might mean--was stronger here; I could feel a certain
masculine urgency here, a sense of being goosed along.


"So," he would say, after twenty minutes of silence had elapsed.
Sometimes he would repeat the word--"So. So." Prompted, I would
edge into the one topic that I felt sure he approved of, the disjunction
between my intellectual potential and my school performance.
A certain amount of dissimulation crept in here, because there was
very little school performance at all in those days, and not much
school attendance either. But I liked the topic, because I had found

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One day, in passing and for the first time, I happened to mention
a dream. Dr. G sat up smartly in his chair and reached for his
clipboard. Tell me more, he said. He scribbled intently as I spoke,
obviously anxious not to slow down or interrupt my account, looking
up from his notes to give me quick, hyperalert glances.


The dream was one I had dreamed years earlier, when we first
moved to Washington, and it was simple, memorable, and frightening.
In the dream I was reading in bed. My mother came into the
room to say good night to me. Put away the book and go to sleep, she
said. She left and I turned off the light, but after a moment I turned
it on and took up my book again, with a guilty consciousness that I
was defying my mother's wishes. Suddenly the perspective of the
dream shifted, and I found myself looking down on the roofs of
Broxburn Court, our old suburban cul-de-sac, from a place high up
in the night sky. The houses were lighted, and everything was still. I
knew that in the moment when I had turned my light back on, sat
up and opened the book, every human being in the world had disappeared,
and that I was completely alone.


Like a laboratory pigeon pecking randomly at a panel of buttons,
I had apparently hit the one that made seed mix come gushing
out of the spout. When I finished my narration, I looked up to
see that Dr. G had put down his clipboard and removed his half-glasses.
My dream had obviously moved him; he was looking into

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The moment passed; Dr. G acknowledged it with a regretful
sigh, shuddering faintly on the exhale, as if he were calling himself
back to his duties. What came to my mind in connection to the
dream? he asked. What kind of book could it be that my mother had
forbidden me to read, and why would reading it mean the end of the
world?


As the months wore on, Dr. G's interjections grew rarer. Almost
imperceptibly he had begun a weaning process: Each session he
withdrew further into silence. It was that silence, or the breaches
of it--ever more meaningful as they grew rarer--that taught me
the topography of the therapy world.


What did I learn? A large part of the lesson was simply review.
What I already knew was confirmed and underwritten: Almost anything
I said would disappear into a pit of silent neutrality. My offerings
were a long time falling, and they hit the distant bottom with
the faintest of thuds. My hesitations in Dr. V's office had turned out
to be well founded; Dr. G'&gt;s impassivity confirmed my early suspicions
that the events of my daily life were too humble and particular
to serve as a fit topic for therapy. On more than one occasion I
entered his office fighting tears because of some slight I had suffered
at school and spent the hour staring fixedly at a place on the wall a

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But tears that welled up in response to the telling of a dream
or a dimly remembered childhood event were warmly received. I
had only to mention a dream to make Dr. G's face take color and
expression. This transformation always made me think of a magic
show I had attended as a child: The magician called a pretty girl
onto the stage and presented her with a bouquet of tightly curled
rosebuds. As she stood, blushing, doing her best to endure a barrage
of impertinent questions from the magician, the roses she
was cradling unconsciously in the crook of her elbow began to
bloom, and simultaneously a great hum of gratified amazement
from the audience began to grow.


Whenever I woke up remembering a dream, I carried it through
the noise and distraction of my day at school like a fragile gift. More
often than not, pieces of the dream melted and slid away in the
hours of daylight; by late afternoon, when I sat down in my chair
opposite Dr. G, half of it would be gone, and what remained would
be incoherent. I freely reconstructed missing details, and on a few
occasions replaced a wholly vanished dream with an invented one.
But I did so with trepidation; it seemed to me that dreams, like paper
currency, might be made of material with a distinctive weave, and
that a dream maven like Dr. G might well recognize a counterfeit.


Freshly unearthed memories were prized even more highly than
dreams. It was in Dr. G's office that I first told the story about the
giant egg that Andy and I had collaborated in drawing on the wall of
our bedroom with our crayons. I presented this as a recently
dredged-up discovery, but in fact it was not only a well-established
memory but also a frequently repeated family story, one of my

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was not long before I began to feel I was sitting in a pocket of
fraudulent stench. My omissions, exaggerations, and fabrications
had been piling steadily up, but what really troubled me was the discontinuity
between the sensitive and vulnerable self I presented to
Dr. G and the self that lived outside the office, the self that laughed
loudly, ate greedily, debated volubly, and scoffed at offenses to its
common sense. This two-self problem was recent; it had never bothered
me when I was lying on the couches of Drs. V and H. In those
days, I had still taken therapy for an exercise in make-believe; never
for a moment had I confused myself with the infant I had been playing
at. The difference now was that I had begun the task of integrating
the parts of myself into a whole, and I found that I could not contain
my contradictions.


Which self was I? This was a question I took seriously. In my
mind the dilemma seemed as urgent and foundational as the questions
of the pre-Socratics. What stuff is the world made of? Dorothy
would ask this as she paced the front of the classroom. Is it characterized
by unchanging stillness or by ceaseless flux? Is it one or is it
many?


As I continued in therapy with Dr. G, I began to tilt radically
toward the vulnerable side of the opposition. My guilt about the
deceptions and manipulations I had practiced in his office propelled
me in that direction, as did the belief--very much part of the era's
Zeitgeist--that passivity and vulnerability were more attractive than
rude health. But there were also deeper motivating reasons: Like
anyone growing up in the 1960s, I believed that authenticity was the
first and only virtue, and I had learned by now to locate what was
authentic in myself as lying close to unconsciousness.

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt the powerful reductive suction of psychoanalytic thinking.
My years of psychotherapy had taught me to move away from
the future toward the past, away from the cognitive toward the
emotional, away from the complex toward the simple, away from
the sophisticated toward the primitive, away from the active and
toward the passive--away from the world and toward the self.


The summer before I turned eighteen I spent living with my
boyfriend in a series of borrowed apartments. In August, he and I
took the train to Indianapolis, where we stayed with his thrice-divorced
mother for a few weeks, after which he left to go to college
in Vermont and I returned to Washington. I had no college
plans, so I moved back into my parents' house. For a few months
we achieved a fragile rapprochement.


My mother had taken a job teaching at a small, expensive private
school in suburban Maryland, and she managed to find a
teacher's-aide position there for me. We drove the long commute
together in companionable silence. I began to join my parents for
the cocktail hour--they allowed me a glass of sherry, sometimes
two. I helped my mother cook. She seemed more stable now that
she had work to do outside the house, and while she continued to
drink, she drank less. Sometimes I watched the news with my
father; at the dinner table I began to engage him in political discussions.
I continued to see Dr. G.


In December my boyfriend returned to Washington for the
Christmas break, and the two of us took the train to Indianapolis
once again. After a few weeks, he went back to college in Vermont,
but I stayed on for another month. When he wrote me a letter telling
me he had fallen in love with someone else, I responded by scratching

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The day after my return, my parents took me to Dr. G's office.
When the three of us were ushered into the room, I knew immediately
that my therapy was over. Some membrane had been punctured;
the office was contaminated. Two unfamiliar folding chairs
had been produced for my parents to sit in--chairs that, I supposed,
had been lurking in Dr. G's small utility closet all along.


It had already been decided--when and by whom I never knew
and never asked to know--that I could no longer live at home. Dr.
G presented us with two options: I could enter a pilot family therapy
program for troubled adolescents at the National Institute for Mental
Health in Bethesda, where I would live in a dormitory and my
parents and siblings would come for twice-weekly sessions with a
team of therapists.


Or I could go away to Austen Riggs. Dr. G described this as the
traditional alternative, and to my mind it was far more alluring than
the NIMH program, which sounded dismayingly clinical. I could
imagine myself walking under the arcade of tall lilac bushes that I
remembered from my visits to the Riggs campus; in my mind's eye I
was transformed into a pale, attenuated, idealized version of myself,
pensive and lovely and lost in dreaminess. On my forays with Caroline,
I had been a grubby civilian, unbecomingly eager for a glance
at the mysteries practiced in the Inn. As a patient, I would become
one of the initiated.


Predictably, my father seemed to like the NIMH option. Was
this program, he asked, regarded as respectable? Oh, entirely, said
Dr. G. Otherwise NIMH would never give it houseroom. My
father seemed open to the idea that this kind of directive, accelerated
therapy might bring us all closer; it appealed to his problem-solving,

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother paused for a moment, an ironic, lingering smile
playing at the corners of her mouth, and gave her verdict. She was
sure that the NIMH program represented the most up-to-date thinking
in the profession, she said, and she was also sure that many people
would find that kind of thing helpful, but she was too old-fashioned,
too reticent, and perhaps just too selfish, to find it attractive.
She gave Dr. G her most rueful, most apologetic smile, got a small
acknowledging smile in return, then turned her smile on my father
and me. Is that all right, my dears? Can you forgive me for my cowardice?


My father protested; Riggs was a place for the wealthy, he
argued. Even a stay of a few months would bankrupt us. Dr. G suggested
that he look into the provisions of his government insurance
policy. It was just possible that some of the Riggs expenses might be
covered. When we got home that afternoon, my father went into his
study and made a few phone calls. He discovered that his insurance
would indeed cover the major part of the cost of a private hospitalization
for at least a year, and that in the end Riggs might actually
cost us less than NIMH.


So Riggs it was. Arrangements were made, and the day before I
was to leave for Stockbridge, I met with Dr. G for a final session. The
atmosphere in the office was strikingly different; the therapeutic suction
