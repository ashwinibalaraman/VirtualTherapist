<i>Information for Counselors</i>


Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an
umbrella term for a number of different
diseases or medical conditions. This is often
confusing, both to the counselor and to the
client, because reported statistics are based on
a different combination of diagnoses and different
terms are used for similar conditions.
For example, the American Heart Association
(AHA), which provides excellent, reliable,
and accessible information on the Web
(<a href="http://americanheart.org">http://americanheart.org</a>), reports "total cardiovascular
diseases" referring to all diseases
of the circulatory system. The National
Center for Health Statistics and the Centers
for Disease Control, however, include only
diseases with the term heart in them, representing
approximately three fourths of the
AHA-cited statistics (AHA, 2002b).


This chapter focuses on the major CVDs
that affect women. CVD deaths in women
have exceeded those of men since 1984; in
1999, females represented 53.5% of deaths
from CVD (AHA, 2002a). Approximately
one in five women has CVD (AHA, 2002a).
In 1999, CVD was the leading cause of death
for White females (42.5% of all White female
deaths), 1 Black females (40.8%), Hispanic
females (33.7%), Asian/Pacific Islander females
(36.3%), and American Indian/ Alaskan Native
females (27%) (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services [DHHS], 2001).


It is important that counselors know these
facts about CVD in women, especially because
of the major differences between women's perceptions
(and the perceptions of those who
love them and of some health care providers)
and the facts. These misconceptions can result
in disability or premature death for women
who do not seek diagnosis or treatment or
who see health care professionals who dismiss
or do not screen for or recognize their symptoms.
Although coronary artery disease (CAD) is the

[p. <i>378</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00389&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another long-held, but false, belief is that
heart disease is a man's disease (Jacobs &amp;
Sherwood, 1996). This misperception is
likely because CAD and its manifestations,
such as myocardial infarction (MI, or heart
attack), angina pectoris (chest pain due to
CAD), and sudden cardiac death, occur with
more severe symptoms and result in death at
an earlier age for men than for women. CAD
occurs approximately 10 years later in
women than in men. By age 60, 1 in 5 men has
had a coronary event, whereas only 1 in 17
women has had such an event. CAD is also
age dependent in women. For example, at age
65 or older, 1 in 3 women has some clinical
manifestations of CAD, in contrast to 1 in 9
women aged 45 to 64 (Wenger, 1999).


Counselors can be helpful to women with
heart disease or at risk for heart disease in a
number of ways. There is much to suggest
that (a) women's minds, emotions, and the
entirety of their psychosocial experiences
affect the health of their hearts; (b) the health
of women's hearts and cardiovascular systems
affects their mental health; and (c) these
mind-body interactions work throughout the
development and course of CAD (Jacobs &amp;
Sherwood, 1996). By simply recognizing the
importance of CAD, the coronary risk factors,
symptoms, and treatments and sharing this
information with female clients, counselors
can play an extremely important role.


Counselors can encourage women to get
screened for risk factors and obtain appropriate
diagnostic tests or treatment, and they
can teach women skills to help them communicate
with other health care providers and
make decisions about their health or treatment
or both. Counselors can also help
women modify risk factors caused by lifestyle
or the stresses of everyday life. Finally, counselors
can assist clients with CAD or other
CVD in their rehabilitation and recovery or
in learning to live with a chronic, disabling,
and/or life-threatening disease.


<b>CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES:
INCIDENCE, SYMPTOMS,
ETIOLOGY, AND RISK
FACTORS IN WOMEN</b>


<b>Coronary Artery Disease</b>


Coronary artery disease, the cardiovascular
disease that affects the most people, is the
leading cause of death and disability in the
United States and in the rest of the industrialized
Western world. Research on women
with CAD has been neglected; CAD has been
viewed as a man's disease, even though it is the
number one killer of American women. CAD
occurs when cholesterol-laden plaques and
fatty deposits build up in the linings of the
heart's arteries (atherosclerosis) causing less
blood to reach the heart muscle, damaging the
muscle and resulting in the healthy heart muscle
having to work harder. CAD may go undetected
and have no symptoms; in 63% of
women who died suddenly of CAD, there were
no symptoms of the disease (AHA, 2002a).


Manifestations of CAD include angina
pectoris, which is chest pain or discomfort
caused by reduced blood supply to the heart
muscle and is more common in women than
in men. Approximately 3.9% of non-Hispanic
White women, 6.2% of non-Hispanic Black
women, and 5.5% of Mexican American

[p. <i>379</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00390&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Coronary Risk Factors</i>


A number of behavioral and psychosocial
factors contribute to CAD, such as smoking,
obesity, eating foods high in fat and cholesterol,
not exercising, depression, anxiety, personality
factors and character traits, social
isolation, chronic life stress, and low socio-economic
status (SES) (Allan &amp; Scheidt, 1996;
Jacobs &amp; Sherwood, 1996; Jacobs &amp; Stone,
1999; Rozanski, Blumenthal, &amp; Kaplan,
1999). Hypertension and high cholesterol,
which are often related to the previously
mentioned behavioral factors, are also risk
factors. Frighteningly, 70% of women have
at least one major CAD risk factor, such as
smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
obesity, or diabetes (Wenger, 1999). Six of
10 women have a sedentary lifestyle, the
most prevalent coronary risk factor for
women today (Wenger, 1999). Many of the
risk factors can be reduced through behavioral
interventions, and counselors can assist
women in this process.


Research indicates that the most likely "profile"
of a woman with high CAD risk is a
woman of lower social class who has little formal
education and high levels of perceived stress
and physical tension. She is likely a homemaker
who feels socially unsupported; if she works outside
the home, she still does all the home tasks
and seldom has a vacation. She is at higher risk
if she is widowed and experiences loneliness and
hopelessness, smokes cigarettes, consumes high
levels of dietary fat and cholesterol, and engages
in little physical activity (Brezinka &amp; Kittel as
cited in Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999).


<i>Gender Differences</i>


There are numerous gender differences in
the detection and treatment of CAD and
heart attacks. Women present later and seek
care more slowly for symptoms of acute disease
(Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999). They appear to
be protected from CAD until their estrogen
levels decrease with menopause. There is evidence,
however, that premenopausal women
who have irregular menstrual periods or
some ovarian impairment may experience
accelerated athersclerosis (Rozanski et al.,
1999). Psychosocial factors may influence the
detection and treatment of CAD and its manifestations
in women. Although more
research is needed to discern the differences
and factors involved, these gender differences
may be partly due to differences in the public's
and physicians' beliefs about women's
risks for heart disease, women's and physicians'
perceptions of symptoms, or other psychosocial
differences between the genders
(Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999).


Martin, Gordon, and Lounsbury (1998)
examined the role of commonsense models of
heart disease in the attribution of cardiac-related
symptoms. After being exposed to a
brief fictional vignette about an individual
experiencing symptoms, participants were
less likely to attribute these symptoms to cardiac
causes for female victims reporting
stressful life events than for female victims
without such stressors or for male victims
with or without concurrent stressors. The
researchers believe that stereotypes associating
CAD with men may have accounted for
gender differences in attribution of cardiac-related
symptoms.


The extent to which CAD is still viewed as
a man's disease, even after extensive educational
campaigns by the AHA and other
organizations, is what McKinlay, Crawford,
McKinlay, and Sellers (1993) refer to as the
social construction of disease prevalence.

[p. <i>380</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00391&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because most of the CAD research on psychosocial
factors or interventions has been on
men, it is important that counselors attend to
possible gender differences when interpreting
research findings. Most likely, a number of
factors work together to influence women's
decisions to delay treatment. For example,
Ayanian and Epstein (1997) found no differences
between men and women presenting
for exercise testing in their willingness to seek
a second opinion, to reduce physical activity,
or to take medication to avoid major cardiac
surgery. They did find, however, that men
were 2.5 times more likely than women to
describe themselves as risk takers.


<i>Socioeconomic Status and Race</i>


As with gender, the roles of SES and race
in CAD have rarely been addressed by
researchers. Lower SES and lower educational
levels, however, are clearly linked to
CAD risk (Lenfant, 1996). An association
between SES and health occurs for all levels
of SES; the higher one moves up in SES, the
healthier one becomes (Adler, Boyce,
Chesney, Folkman, &amp; Syme, 1993). For
example, in a study of nurses, low SES in
childhood was moderately related to an
increased risk of MI and total CVD in adulthood
(Gliksman et al., 1995).


The overall death rate for CAD in 1999
was lower for Caucasian women than for
Black women (AHA, 2002a). Likewise, in an
epidemiological study, the total incidence of
CAD was higher in African American women
aged 25 to 54 than in White women of the
same ages (Gilman, Mussolino, &amp; Madans,
1997). Escobedo, Giles, and Anda (1997)
found that younger African Americans are
more likely than younger Caucasians to die
as a result of CAD.


Importantly, however, low SES (as measured
by family income, occupational status,
and educational attainment) rather than race
may be the reason for the observed excess of
African American mortality. Low SES may be
a marker for insufficient medical care.
African Americans have less access to and
lower-quality medical care and are less likely
to receive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
for MIs after being admitted to hospitals
than Caucasians. African Americans
admitted to hospitals for acute MIs also have
higher case fatality rates than Caucasians and
are less likely than Caucasians to survive
symptomatic CAD. Escobedo et al. (1997)
note that "in the United States, social class
explains a significant amount of coronary
heart disease mortality among the general
population" (p. 127).


There are also higher risk factors among
African American and Mexican American
women than among White women of comparable
SES (DHHS, 2001). High blood pressure
and smoking rates are more severe
among African American women than all the
other groups. A significant number of
Hispanic women are also affected by the
problems of smoking and obesity. Among
American Indian/Alaska Native women,
61.4% have one or more CAD or heart disease
risk factors, such as high blood pressure,
cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol,
obesity, or diabetes (Bacher &amp; Campbell,
2000). Asian/Pacific Islander women have

<b>Myocardial Infarction</b>


A heart attack, technically a MI, occurs
when an artery that supplies blood to the
heart becomes blocked, cutting off oxygen
and nutrients to the heart and usually damaging
or killing part of the heart's muscle.
This can be due to the long-term chronic
development of plaque in the arteries or an
acute stress that may rupture the plaque in
arteries and block blood flow to the heart.


As previously mentioned, many women
have a heart attack without previous symptoms.
The warning signs of a heart attack
may be sudden and intense or start slowly,
with mild pain or discomfort. Signs of a possible
heart attack are (a) discomfort in the
center of the chest that lasts more than a few
minutes or that goes away and returns. It can
be an uncomfortable pressure, squeezing,
fullness, or pain; (b) discomfort or pain in the
upper body, such as in one or both arms, the
neck, jaw, stomach, or back; (c) shortness of
breath with or before chest discomfort; or
(d) other signs, such as nausea, lightheadedness,
or a cold sweat (AHA, 2002d).


<i>Gender Differences</i>


The initial presentation of CAD for women
is likely to be MI. Initial MIs are more likely to
be fatal for women than for men. Women also
have increased 30-day mortality rates and
early reinfarction. They are also likely to have
silent (i.e., without symptoms noticeable to the
woman) and unrecognized MIs, perhaps
because of their older age and complicating
comorbidities, such as diabetes or hypertension.
Women are treated less aggressively in
the hospital for MIs and are less likely to
receive acute interventions (Wenger, 1999).


<i>Socioeconomic Status and Race</i>


Rural American Indian patients with acute
MI have delayed presentations to emergency
facilities (Brody et al., 2001). Because misinterpretation
of symptoms was the predominant
cause of patient delay, Brody et al. concluded
that there is a need for community-based education
among rural American Indians.


African Americans appear to have similar
short-term mortality as that of Caucasians
following acute MI. Researchers, however,
found that in an insured population, African
Americans had worse chances for long-term
survival post-MI compared to Caucasians
(Manhapra et al., 2001).


<b>Heart Failure</b>


Heart failure, or congestive heart failure,
occurs when the heart is not pumping as well
as it is supposed to pump. It is a serious condition
but one that can be lived with, affecting
approximately 5 million people of all
ages, predominantly older adults and
women. In 1999, approximately 32,000
women died of congestive heart failure, representing
62.6% of total deaths from heart
failure (AHA, 2002a). The death rate for
Black females was 19.4% compared to
18.2% for Caucasian females.


Although heart failure is not directly
caused by behavioral or psychosocial factors,
it is often a result of other conditions, such as
CAD, previous heart attacks, or uncontrolled
hypertension, that are often the result of
behavioral factors. Heart failure can also be
caused by congenital heart disease, abnormal
heart valves, inflammation of the heart, or
severe lung disease. Many middle- and older-aged
women have heart failure or are caregivers
for someone else "living with heart
failure" (AHA, 2002c).


Even moderately overweight people have an
increased chance of developing heart failure.
There is a link between obesity and enlargement

<b>Other Cardiovascular Diseases</b>


There are many other cardiovascular
diseasesmore than we can cover in this
chapter. One condition that counselors may
encounter in their clients is arrhythmia, which
refers to any change from the normal sequence
of electrical impulses, causing abnormal heart
rhythms and the heart to pump less effectively.
Tachycardia is a heart rate of more than 100
beats per minute and can produce symptoms
of palpitation, rapid heart action, dizziness,
lightheadedness, or fainting.


In the ventricles of the heart, tachycardia
can be life threatening. These life-threatening
rhythms are often controlled by using an
electronic device called an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator.


A rhythm that is too slow, less than 60 beats
per minutes, is bradycardia. This can cause
fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
spells. It can be corrected by implanting an electronic
pacemaker (AHA, 2002c). Hypertension
and high cholesterol, both cardiovascular diseases,
like diabetes, are also risk factors for other
CAD and acute coronary events, such as MI.


<b>SCREENING,
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, MEDICAL
TREATMENTS, AND SIDE EFFECTS</b>


Contemporary cardiology has greatly reduced
deaths from CAD through advances in diagnosis
and treatment with such technologies as
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,
thrombolysis, and coronary artery
bypass grafts surgery (CABG) or through
managing life-threatening conditions, such as
acute MI or unstable angina. In contrast to
men, the reduction in mortality from CVD for
women has remained relatively stable during
the past 20 years (Marwick &amp; Miller, 1999).
Researchers have found a gender bias in
patients referred for angiography, which is
often recommended for detecting CAD after
positive noninvasive tests or after an MI.
Women are also less often referred for other
procedures Marwick and Miller provide a
summary of the current recommendations for
women for coronary angioplasty.


The reliability and sensitivity of these interventions
and both the noninvasive and invasive
testing techniques have been questioned for
women. This is primarily because reports on
the accuracy and safety of these procedures
have for the most part excluded or included
very small numbers of women. Shaw, Peterson,
and Johnson (1999) provide a useful review of
noninvasive testing techniques for diagnosis
and prognosis. They include some recommendations
based on a woman's age, symptoms,
functional capacity, and risk profile.


Patients with chronic, stable CAD are usually
treated medically. It appears that thrombolytic
therapy, which is usually given before
an angioplasty and post-MI, is less useful in
women than in men. Aspirin has been found
to be efficacious for women for primary prevention
and secondary prevention. Beta
blockers have also been found to be effective
in reducing post-MI mortality for women
(Marwick &amp; Miller, 1999).


<b>Hormone Replacement Therapy</b>


Developments in the investigation of hormone
replacement therapy (HRT), often prescribed
to reduce the chances of a cardiac event

[p. <i>383</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00394&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The Women's Health Initiative, a randomized
primary prevention trial, investigated the
use of the estrogen-progestin combination
(Prempro) compared to placebo in 16,608
women (Fletcher &amp; Colditz, 2002). The study
was stopped after 5 years, however, because of
results indicating that women receiving HRT
were at increased risk for invasive breast cancer.
Other negative health outcomes revealed by the
study included increased risks for CAD, stroke,
and pulmonary embolism. There was some
indication, however, that decreases in colorectal
cancer and hip fracture also accompanied HRT.


Many women who have been prescribed
HRT to reduce their risk of CAD or osteoporosis
or to control menopausal symptoms
are frustrated, scared, and confused about
what to do. Counselors may be approached
by women to help them with their concerns
and to sort through the myriad of information.
Although a radiant-looking Patti
LaBelle declared in Wyeth advertising on the
Web, "I'm glad I said yes to Prempro," the
previously mentioned study "suggests that
it's better to say no to those drugsat least
for long-term use" (Enserink, 2002, p. 325).
Regarding the use of HRT to prevent CAD, it
is no longer safe to assume that the estrogen-progestin
combination is a worthy strategy.


There seem to be more harmful side effects
than benefits. It is important to note that this
information is only for the estrogen-progestin
combination, and that it does not seem to
generalize to estrogen-only treatment.


<b>Cardiac Rehabilitation</b>


Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise programs
have been shown to reduce the risk of
recurrent MIs, although fewer than 10% of
all patients who could benefit from these programs
participate (Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999).
Women participate less than men, but when
they do participate, they benefit as much or
more. Grace et al. (2002a,b) reported that the
trend of fewer women than men participating
in CR programs continues; younger individuals
are more likely to attend than older individuals
(King, Humen, Smith, Phan, &amp; Teo,
2001). In an effort to understand the low
rates of referral and participation for women in
CR programs, Grace et al. investigated factors
that predict CR program participation.
Income, anxiety symptoms, and self-efficacy
were all predictors of participation. Physician
referral rates for women to CR programs
continue to be low, however.


<b>PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES</b>


Psychosocial factors have been found to
increase the risk of CAD and a cardiac event
such as MI and to affect recovery and prognosis.
The obvious concerns to which counselors
can attend are the unhealthy behaviors
that put women at high risk for CAD.
Although based on research conducted on
more men than women, Rozanski et al.
(1999) summarized the clear evidence that
psychosocial factors contribute to CAD.
They reported on evidence that links CAD
risks to psychosocial domains of depression,
anxiety, personality factors and character
traits, social isolation, and chronic life stress.
These are all areas that counselors can
address.


Jacobs and Stone (1999) also summarized
the key psychosocial issues in CAD in
women. In terms of social factors, lower class
is related to higher CAD risk, and differences
in race are confounded by differences in SES.
In terms of personality and role factors,
(a) hostility and anger may be related to
cardiac reactivity, (b) Type A personality is a

[p. <i>384</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00395&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Changing Risk Behaviors</b>


Counselors can help women to stop smoking
(Ockene, Bonello, &amp; Adams, 1999) and
lose weight (Berensen et al., 1999). Working
with clients to decrease their sedentary
behavior can help reduce both the primary
and the secondary cardiac risks for women
(Fair, Berra, &amp; King, 1999).


<b>Depression and Vital Exhaustion</b>


There is clear evidence of a strong relationship
between depression and CAD, both
as a risk factor for CAD and as a risk factor
for morbidity and mortality following cardiac
events (Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999; Rozanski
et al., 1999). A history of dysphoria and a
major depressive episode appears to increase
the risk of MI (Pratt et al., 1996; Soteriades
et al., 2001). Hopelessness has specifically
been linked to the development of CAD and
sudden death (Rozanski et al., 1999). Women
are twice as likely to be depressed as men and
to experience a comorbidity between depression
and CVD. Research on vital exhaustion
also supports a link between depressive
symptoms and CAD in women (Appels &amp;
Mulder; 1989; Koertge et al., 2002). Vital
exhaustion is characterized by emotional and
physical fatigue, increased irritability, and
demoralization (Appels, 1997).


Counselors who work with clients who are
dysphoric or depressed and who have other
risk factors for CAD should urge their clients
to be seen by a physician for a physical and
possible diagnostic tests and referral to a cardiologist.
For clients with CAD or hypertension
who are depressed, counselors need to
consider the possible pharmacological contributions
to the depressive symptoms. For
example, beta blockers may cause fatigue, difficulty
concentrating, loss of mental alertness,
insomnia and nightmares, and sexual dysfunction.
Certain calcium blockers, such as
nifedipine, can cause reflex tachycardias,
which are often distressing to patients, who
report them as palpitations. Antilipid agents
(statin drugs) may cause sleep disturbance
(Tabrizi, Littman Williams, &amp; Scheidt, 1996).


Researchers have recently begun to investigate
the effectiveness of treatments for
depression or social isolation or both in
patients with CAD (Rozanski et al., 1999).
For example, investigators involved in the
Enhancing Recovery in Cardiovascular Heart
Disease study (ENRICHD Investigators, 2000;
Louis, Namousos, Coletta, Clark, &amp; Cleland,
2002) used in-home cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) to decrease patients' depressive
symptoms and increase their social support
in an effort to decrease patient
mortality. Although there were increases in
social support and decreases in depression,
there was no difference in the rate of patient
death between the CBT group and the control
group. (See Chapter 27, this volume, for
a complete discussion of depression.)


<b>Anxiety and Panic Attacks</b>


Increasing evidence links anxiety disorders
to the development of CAD and cardiac
events (Rozanski et al., 1999). Anxiety and
panic have been linked to sudden cardiac
death but not to MIs; these studies, however,
did not include women, in whom there is a

[p. <i>385</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00396&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Hostility, Anger, and Type A Behaviors</b>


A number of personality or character
traits have been studied in relationship to
CAD risk, but these studies have again been
primarily on men (Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999;
Rozanski et al., 1999). Hostility, a major
attribute of the Type A behavior pattern, has
been investigated as the major "toxic" element
prognostic of the development of CAD
in a number of studies with mixed results.
Anger has been found to be related to cardiac
events. Hostility has been found to be related
to a higher rate of restensosis (i.e., recurrent
stenosis, a narrowing or obstruction of the
artery) following angioplasty and more
ischemia (a deficiency of blood supply to the
heart muscle due to a constriction or obstruction
of a blood vessel) during stress testing
(Rozanski et al., 1999). There have been few
studies on women focusing on hostility or
anger and CAD (Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999).
Episodes of anger in the 2 hours prior to MI
onset have also been found to increase the
risk of MI (Mittleman et al., 1995). For
women who are angry and respond with
increased cardiac reactivity, counselors may
consider training in anger management and
techniques that elicit the relaxation response.


<b>Social Support and Social Isolation</b>


Research on different aspects of social
support and social isolation (and lack of
social support) and CAD has been conducted
since the late 1970s (Rozanski et al., 1999).
A small network of social ties has been associated
with an increased risk of CAD over
time, as have low levels of perceived emotional
support. Berkman, Leo-Summers, and
Horwitz (1992) found an approximately
threefold increase in future cardiac events in
post-MI patients who reported a low level of
emotional support. They also found that
social networks or ties did not account for
gender differences in CAD risk. The role of
social support is more complicated for
women than for men. The consequences of
social support are sometimes negative for
women because they provide support as well
as receive it; they often care for elderly relatives,
are in supportive occupations such as
nursing or teaching, and care for children
(Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999). In recent research on
older women with CAD, Janz et al. (2001)
found that quality of life was related to maintaining
or improving women's satisfaction
with social activities. Plach and Heidrich
(2002) found that women's ability to reengage
in social roles was a critical factor in
recovery from CABG surgery or cardiac
valvular or atrial-septal defect repair.


<b>Psychological Stress</b>


Both acute and long-term or chronic psychological
stresses have been found to be
related to CAD development and the onset of
acute symptoms in epidemiological and laboratory
studies. Researchers have investigated
stressful life events, job stress or role strain or
both, and reactivity to laboratory stressors
(Allan &amp; Scheidt, 1996; Jacobs &amp; Stone,
1999; Rosanski et al., 1999). Job stress has
been considered a risk factor for CAD, especially
job strain (the combination of low job

<b>Clustering of Psychosocial Variables</b>


The psychosocial stresses discussed in this
chapter and reviewed by Rosanski et al.
(1999) and Jacobs and Stone (1999) each
appear to contribute to the development,
acute manifestation, and prognosis of CAD
in women. In the real world, however, they
tend to cluster together, such as depression
and anxiety and social isolation, and as such
present even greater CAD risk. Other psychosocial
concepts may also be involved. For
example, recent evidence suggests that some
individuals with CAD may be at risk for
developing posttraumatic stress disorder as a
result of their event (Pederson, 2001).


<b>CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS</b>


Women with CAD have a higher rate of mortality
than men, and this is especially the case if
they are of lower SES. More women reinfarct
after a MI than men and have a poorer prognosis
in other areas. Women are more likely to
be anxious, depressed, stressed, and unhappy
with their social support following an acute MI
and are less likely to enter CR programs than
men (Jacobs &amp; Stone, 1999). There is clear
evidence of the significance of SES, health
behaviors, and psychological factors in the
etiology, prevention, detection, and treatment
of and recovery from CAD. Other possible contributors
to CAD risk are culture, race, environment,
and neighborhood. There are gender
differences throughout the course of CAD.


Counselors can play a role by assessing
and treating their clients with high CAD risk
through (a) educating them about CAD
symptoms and risks and advocating heart-healthy
behavioral change; (b) referring them
to their physician for a checkup and possible
diagnostic tests; (c) helping them modify
their risk behaviors; and (d) decreasing any
anxiety, depression, social isolation, or other
psychosocial stresses or symptoms they may
be experiencing. Counselors need to be aware
of the mind-heart health link and help their
clients understand it and learn to talk to their
physicians about their symptoms, psychological
as well as physical.


According to Rosanski et al. (1999), only
14 published behavioral intervention trials
have examined the effect of psychosocial
interventions on the frequency of cardiac
events such as MIs. These trials had limited
numbers of participants, and many had ineffective
interventions. The number of women
or minority participants was not reported in
the review, but we assume there were few, if
any, female or minority participants or both
in these trials.


<b>Client- or Patient-Specific Counseling</b>


Rosanki et al. (1999) suggest the development
of patient-specific treatment plans based
on "the profiling of the major psychosocial
risks in individual patients" (p. 2208). We
agree with this approach not only for future
research but also for immediate use by the
individual counselor with his or her clients.
Counselors need to assess the particular CAD
risk factors for each woman client at risk for
CAD. For instance, counseling goals for a

[p. <i>387</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00398&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Counselors can also help reduce the
secondary risk factors of women who have
CAD or who have had a MI. Using the following
example of Anna, we demonstrate
some of the multiple psychosocial issues that
counselors may encounter in working with
women with CAD and suggest ways to
address them.


Anna, a 69-year-old widow on a fixed and
low income, had her first heart attack
5 weeks before her first counseling appointment.
She was surprised because she had no
warning signs. She was referred and brought
to counseling by a social worker from the
same agency that is assigned to three of
Anna's grandchildren. Anna gained custody
of her grandchildren, ages 4 to 9, 3 months
before the heart attack when her daughter
was imprisoned for selling methamphetamine.
Anna's other children do not live in the
same state and lack resources to help her. The
social worker noted that Anna was somewhat
despondent and reported anxiety
attacks. After checking further with Anna,
the social worker found that Anna had
missed her doctor's appointment and was not
going to cardiac rehabilitation and had not
changed her high-fat diet as recommended.
She had also not attended church since her
daughter's imprisonment, once a very important
support for her. The social worker
talked to Anna's physician, who indicated
that Anna was in danger of reinfarction and
possible death if she did not change her habits.
Anna agreed to meet with the counselor at
the social worker's agency, which deals with
low-income clients such as Anna.


A number of major concerns need to be
addressed quickly: (a) the financial and functional
support for Anna to care for both herself
and her grandchildren; she is "terrified"
that the children will have to go to foster care
or that she will die and not be there to care
for them; (b) her depression and her "anxiety
attacks"; and (c) her apparent lack of compliance
with the dietary and exercise changes
prescribed by her physician. The counselor
needs to obtain a release to discuss Anna's
situation with Anna's physician and the
social worker immediately.


The counselor and Anna, perhaps with the
help of the social worker, need to explore
community or other resources to allow Anna
to have someone help with the grandchildren
while she goes to appointments. The counselor
and Anna need to also explore and
problem solve other obstacles to and possible
supports for Anna going to cardiac rehabilitation
or getting other exercise, doctor
appointments, time for herself, or changing
to a low-fat diet. In Anna's case, these obstacles
are likely financial, the inability to take
time away from the children and the support
she needs to provide to them, lack of knowledge,
and possible lack of transportation.
Her possible supports include the social
worker, a friend, and her minister from
church; wanting to care for her daughter's
children and their love; her resilience with
past "problems," such as her daughter's drug
problem and her husband's death from a
heart attack; and her faith.


In addition, the counselor needs to immediately
assess Anna's depression and anxiety
attacks and begin cognitive-behavioral or
interpersonal therapy for depression. The
counselor should contact Anna's physician to
discuss the possibility of antidepressant medication
and whether the hypertension and
heart medication Anna is currently taking

[p. <i>388</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000003096-I00399&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The counselor will need to help Anna
learn to talk to her physician. This could
include techniques such as writing out questions
or taking a friend to appointments with
her. Ideally, Anna would find a way to go
start cardiac rehabilitation and begin exercising,
decrease her fear of a heart attack from
exercising (her husband died during his second
heart attack while shoveling snow), and
meet other people who have survived heart
attacks. If not, the counselor may need to
explore with Anna other ways to increase her
exercise and decrease her fears about exercise.
Cardiac support groups, if available, are
ideal, but they are likely not available for
Anna. The counselor may then need to work
with Anna to help her find out how to get
social support for herself. In addition, the
counselor could work with her on stress management
techniques, such as those that elicit
the relaxation response (e.g., prayer or a
repetitive mental focus while walking).
Finally, the counselor is encouraged to help
Anna explore her beliefs and the support she
finds in her faith and in caring for her grandchildren
and her thoughts about her heart
attack and why it happened.


Counselors may also be able to improve
prognosis and contribute to a better quality
of life for their clients by attending to their
religiosity and spirituality. For example,
based on their extensive experience from
leading post-MI groups of women and men,
Bracke and Thoresen (1996) suggested that
health care providers can help patients with
CAD make lifestyle changes that reduce mortality
and morbidity by helping them examine
their unexplored and unresolved spiritual,
religious, and existential issues.


A brief list of resources for counselors
working with women with heart disease or
women seeking to reduce their risk of developing
heart disease or an acute coronary
event is provided at the end of this chapter.
We urge you to simply use your best counseling
skills and what the literature and other
chapters in this volume offer in terms of
interventions for the various psychosocial
factors associated with CAD or CAD risk in
women. Finally, listen to the woman with
empathy and ask about her everyday life and
relationships, habits, and what her other
health care professionals are telling her.
