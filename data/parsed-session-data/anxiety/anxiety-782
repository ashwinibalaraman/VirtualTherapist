THE SECRET NONE CAN UTTER</b>


In what Shop, or Operatory the Fairies make their Enchantment,
the old Wives have not determined. But the
Operatories of the <i>Clergy</i>, are well enough known to be the
Universities, that received their Discipline from Authority
Pontificiall. . . . The <i>Fairies</i> marry not; but there be
amongst them <i>Incubi</i>, that have copulation with flesh and
blood. The <i>Priests</i> also marry not.

COMPTON Grammar School (for it was of the ancient
Tudor type of grammatical foundation that perpetuated
monasticism, just when monasticism was being
killed in England by the same Tudors, and scholasticism
was dead) had given me the entry into regions
neither Cæsar nor Victoria ever knew. It really had
fulfilled something of what Edward VI. and Elizabeth
saw miraculously. It bred in me a sense of England
which Oxford was to satisfy more amply. It is
hard to define that sense; hardest if I must necessarily
dwell on what in it I saw worst, because, unlike Mr.
Sleary in <i>Hard Times</i>, I made the wurtht of it as well
as the betht. I hope there are enough Victorians left
to recognise that allusion from a vital work of art of
and about their period. I am not painting an oleograph,
which, by way of Germany, that period also
developed: I am only telling the truth. “‘Don't

When I won a scholarship at Starminster College,
Oxford, I had the chance of my life. The fault is not
in our stars, but in ourselves; and I was to be, in the
long run, an underling wriggling in the mud myself
had churned up. My star lay in the fact that I had the
two best tutors in Oxford; whom, since I have so
fallen from their generous hopes, and they are dead
untimely, I will not name. They were at some
variance with the other Fellows of their Society, who
were mostly parsons, except the chief classical tutor,
who wrote excellent elegiacs but otherwise was

He still bleats, and the college, after the death of A-----
and B-----, has snored itself into a Gibbonesque
lethargy again.


an old, half-witted sheep,<br />
Which bleats articulate monotony.


I achieved reasonable credit in the schools--a second
in Mods. and a second in Greats. They might have
been firsts if I had not been too seriously occupied
with other games. I was president of the College
Whist Club, secretary of the Guardians of the Groves
(an old club with an excuse for luncheons, and a
pleasant uniform, and old brown sherry), cricket and
Rugby captain, president of the College Athletic club,
secretary of its Amalgamated Clubs and its Junior
Common Room. I drank like a fish (though in a
different method and medium) and usually went to
bed about 3 a.m. But I also got up, usually, at 7.30
a.m. It had pleased God, or my forefathers, or

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is this also to be said--as the old half-witted
sheep said in introducing me to the new head of the
college twenty years later: “Mr. Pole was up in those
very brilliant years, 189-.” I had the curiosity not
long ago to look up the class-lists of my years at
Oxford. They contained in embryo a very large
number of to-day's real rulers: a proportion unduly
great even for Oxford. There is no walk of public
life which one or other of my contemporaries does not
now adorn, from the Cabinet, the Judiciary, the Civil
Service down. Those two tutors whom I have mentioned
had a great part in rearing this brood, for half
Oxford came to their lectures. Indeed, the college
hall was not big enough to contain their hearers, and
they borrowed the largest hall in Oxford for their
performances.


I suppose most colleges at Oxford and Cambridge
shared that mixture of excellence and dulness in their
staff. At Sturminster, however, we were privileged
to possess a few interesting survivals of the antique
years: though whether, like old Adam, they had the
constant virtues, may be doubted. Dr. Swyre was a
very handsome man with a white beard, which was as
beautifully kept as his always immaculate clothing
(most dons then were subject to maculation of garb

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Nor should I omit from a brief survey of that
Fellowship a high official of the college, who was
found squatting on his hunkers in the middle of the
second quad at about 5.30 a.m. on a fine summer
morning, under an open umbrella, explaining very
cheerfully that he was “a little mushroom.” It was
unseemly in the vice-head, and those of us who had
recovered more than he from festivities connected
with eight-oared races on the Isis saw to it that he
(and ourselves) retired before the scouts took up their
well-paid duties.


I would place alongside him, for other-worldliness,
three others of our more grave and reverend signors.
The first was the head himself. But of him so many
stories are current that I shall only repeat chestnuts

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Old Billy Stinsford was a curious little flittermouse,
with a refined squeaky voice, a stutter, and a prodigious
knowledge of the classics, which he could
seldom impart to many pupils because of his physical
disabilities. On the birth of his fourth or fifth son he
announced the event joyously to the head, who looked
at him with curious interest, and said “That must
be very gratifying. Whom do you suspect, Mr.
Stinsford?”


Poor old Stinsford: he was a real scholar, but no
teacher except in private, when you found he had a
very witty tongue for the expression of his great and
varied learning. All our classical freshmen at Sturminster
were sent to his lectures: they rarely attended
more than the first two, or if they did so <i>pro forma</i>,
they talked or read novels. They also smoked under
the table. Once we lit a little train of black powder
leading to a small heap under his chair: the lecture

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All the same, we liked him in a queer way, and
respected him, though neither the liking nor the
respect was strong enough to overcome our native
brutality. But he won one of us unexpectedly.
X----- was a large rowing man and a foremost persecutor.
His favourite joke was (with concerted assistance)
to raise slightly the long, light table on one side
of which we ranged facing the lecturer. Then almost
imperceptibly he would either draw it away from
Stinsford or push it into him. The poor little old
man blamed his sight at first, and, thinking that he
was sitting either too near or too far, jerked his chair
back and forth to suit the mobile table. But when
finally X----- got him squeezed tightly against the
wall, he looked up and piped tremulously: “Mr.
X-----, I wish you wouldn't do that. You're a very
big man, and I'm a very small one, and it's not fair.”

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have quoted Hobbes on clerical celibacy. In
those days Fellows, whether priests or not, might not
marry. There was a singular but long secret exception
to this rule. Mr. Bincombe was getting on for
ninety when I went up to Sturminster. He ambled
about the college in the costume of his Waterloo
infancy--a green swallow-tail coat with brass buttons,
tight strapped trousers, and a brilliant yellow leather
waistcoat. This waistcoat was believed to be a relic
of his adventures in China, where he had been on some
small mission for the Foreign Office. He had held
various minor diplomatic posts. But the Foreign
Office required him to have a wife. So he had one--
in London. Oxford forbade him a spouse. So he
had none--in Oxford.


He found this double career (he was one of the old
Life Fellows) expensive. He knew almost to an
hour the varying times at which the other Fellows
received their stipends, and it was this that eventually
revealed his duplicity: for when he died they made
inquiry about several unrepaid loans, and they found
the lady in possession of his effects as heiress--though,
I fear, not as lawful widow.


He was always suspected of being a shameless liar.
His garrulous stories of his foreign service seemed too
steep for belief. But once an old Sturminster man
came back from the Far East and talked to us about
his own experiences. Every word the strange veteran
had said was true. He, too, was a survival from

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While I am on this group of worthies, of a type so
far lost that no constant nymph of to-day can have
seen them, and while also I am on the question of
priestly marriage, I will interpolate a slight record of
another man of letters. Herr Professor Büste, formerly
of several Teutonic Universities, had decided
that a historian had a better chance of prestige and
money in England than in the Fatherland. He learnt
our tongue well, and became a specialist lecturer at a
very famous crammer's, whose ink-splashed beehive
the War killed, because war made us so much wiser,
so independent of knowledge. I came under Dr.
Büste for a few weeks after I left Oxford and tried to
get into the Home Civil Service. It was his business
to stuff me with the meat of that period of modem
history in which Abélard is prominent. Now Abélard
suffered, by the power of Héloise's uncle, the
same unfortunate deprivation as Origen is said to
have conferred on himself by his own hand.


“Well, gentlemen,” said this thunderous Teuton
at the end of a tabloid lecture, “that gongludes my
remarks upon Abelart as a statesman. You all know
what happened to him in his private life. That is no
goncern of serious history. But if some of you young
Oxford stylists could introduce suitably a judicious
reference to his misfortune in any answer where it may
be fitting, I think the examiners appointed by the

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He was a good psychologist, the hard-headed old
ruffian. It was not long before he was lecturing
profitably in Mayfair drawing-rooms--to women--
on problems of sex. As for Abélard, he was right.
We <i>did</i> know what happened to Abélard, and style
(“judiciously” used) did count in such a matter. I
cannot recount here, for lack of that style, the process
by which a scholar of my college deduced (from
Herodotus) that the Lydians wore no nightshirts. It
was the sole entry in his Greek history commonplace
book. But he got a first in Greats.


Scholarship, thank God, is not a matter of knowledge.
It is a matter of style, as Dr. Büste knew, of
using knowledge, not sweating it at every pore, and
of a sense of proportion. Whether I acquired that at
Oxford or not I cannot say. But I learnt that Oxford
was only the beginning of learning, the alphabet of
the wide book of life. When I told my splendid
tutor that--for I uttered to him the secret after I came
down and had discovered it--he wrote me a letter of
thanks that made me see fully how passionate was his
devotion to ideals never forsaken, causes never lost.
I recalled that letter when I wrote to his widow after
his death.


I had the choice there (if I had had the vision!)
between heaven and hell: between doing, being,
“good,” as capable men go, and sheer slack hedonism.
I tried for long to combine both, at Oxford and afterwards;
but eventually (to mix some metaphors), the
flowers I planted along the primrose path to where I

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I will not write more of the good I got at Oxford.
I have no right to. <i>Benedictus benedicit, et sui poenitet</i>.
I am grateful and ashamed. I speak now only of our
manners and customs, which I understand have vastly
changed. There are, it seems, the same defiances of
fashion in clothes. We, too, had our innovations.
The stiff double collar and the knitted silk tie came in
in my time, and the “blood” waistcoat returned from
the age of the French Revolution. On Sundays, in
my first year, we had to wear bowlers, and usually
carried sticks. Hair was still apt to be Victorianly
florid round the mouth, though no longer on the
cheeks. Thick unguents and the backward sweep over
the skull were not discovered. Hatlessness (except in
a punt) was unknown, and so were Stetson hats and
their progeny. Oddly enough, though, we all wore
flannel trousers--but not plus fours. There were, of
course, no motors: Sir E. Morris, I think, made
bicycles. Instead, we had those astonishing hansoms,
then co-existing, indeed flourishing, all over England:
but the Oxford examples were a cross between the
smell of an old clothes shop and the discomfort of a
Celtic chariot turned back to front. Almost every college
had its own liege cabby on the nearest rank. The
faithful fellow, not disinterested, quickly got to know
by sight the successive college hero, and was waiting to
convey him to the college ground or the parks or the
Iffley Road: while the hero, in return, was not unwilling
to be recognised so publicly. <i>Gloria mundi</i>.


Those of us who really worked (and I honestly did),

That reminds me of a silly event in my second year.
One day after lunch I turned out a drawer full of old
papers, notes, cards, and so on of my previous year.
Then I went off to play football, hurriedly. When I
came back I found a card on my table, from one with
whom I was in “digs” the next year, W-----, the
present permanent secretary to one of the greatest
departments. On the back it said, “Dear Pole, will you
come to breakfast next Thursday. . .?” I replied
by note that I would gladly do so, and went. There
was only one other guest--a common friend (now the
editor of a great weekly). I knew them both well,
and could not make out why they seemed half excited,
half restrained. Presently W----- went out on some
excuse. “I suppose you know W----- didn't ask

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The freshers' breakfasts were at least an easy performance.
A couple of seniors clubbed together
and invited eight or ten freshers to a terrific meal. I
forget the order of the bakemeats, for it is long since
I ate a hearty breakfast: but it almost invariably
included as necessary courses the following: porridge,
fish, grilled hen and eggs and bacon, to be
followed by toast and marmalade. To this succeeded
cigarettes and mulled claret in seventeenth century
silver two-quart sconce pots, a lemon pig floating in
the hot drowsy fluid, a napkin (after custom) tucked
into the lovely handle for wiping as the communal
pot passed from hand to hand.


Mulled beer was still known, and of course dog'snose
at Sandford. Many men (I not seldom) still
drank beer or cider at breakfast in place of what Mr.
Belloc (of Salford) in the House of Commons rightly
called “that deleterious stimulant,” tea.


Lunch, unless you were “brekkering does,” or
entertaining friends in the more polite manner (of
course the summer term was the adorable time for
that), consisted, at about one o'clock, of a commons of
bread and butter, cheese, beer and marmalade, and
whatever biscuits, jams, toast, and coffee you had out
of your own store or made over your own fire. Then
football or cricket. If you wanted a hot bath after
football, you had to put down a huge tin can by the
fire beforehand, and stoke the fire. In an hour and a
half's time it was hot. There were no baths and no

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

You worked, more or less, or perhaps simply
loafed, after a heavy tea, until hall dinner at seven
o'clock--the only corporate meal, and you could
“sign off” that three times a week, if you wished to
dine at a restaurant (not then common objects of the
wayside) or in someone's digs or in another college's
hall. No dinners were served in private rooms,
except to the periodic meetings of the wine-clubs.
The eremite and the worldling were oddly mixed in
our life.


It was one of the Sturminster wine-clubs which
achieved a stroke of humour after a happy meeting.
The next morning the statue of the patron saint (St.
Hilarius) on the first-floor wall of the second quad was
observed to be crowned as to the head in an unseemly
manner, to be clasping a champagne bottle in a fold
of his arm, and to be wearing (or at any rate ostending
before his legs) white cricket trousers. A ladder,
left by chance by some repairers, and used by the
members of the club for the purpose of bringing the
saint up-to-date, could not be found: not unnaturally,
for it had been the chief constituent in a discreetly
silent bonfire held at about 3 a.m. that morning in the
quad. So the saint remained on view--a wellstimulated
view--for several hours. The genius who
suggested this sartorial experiment is now a HighChurch
parson doing much good in a poor London
parish.


Other valuable warnings were given to the college
authorities as to the care of their property on two

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The other warning was given by a man who afterwards
wrote at least two very charming books on wild
bird life, and had two divinely pretty sisters. He
spent only a few weeks in Oxford in each of the two
years for which he was tolerated, for he was always
sent down each term after a short time, until the final
dismissal. He ought never to have been sent up, for
he had an amazingly weak head for liquor. I have
seen him mad--really mad-drunk--after two glasses
of champagne; and as he was a man of superb
physique, he was then dangerous. I think the dons

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

His warning was that they should not leave piles of
plates loose in the buttery passage after the scouts had
gone. Some rather absurdly-worded disciplinary rescript
had been put on the chapel door by the Dean.
D----- called attention to it, and increased our already
inflamed anger. We took those plates and from the
other side of the quad proceed to roll, bowl or pitch
them at the noxious door and proclamation. It was
a very pleasing sequence of sound: the howls to
A, B or C to hurry up, the grinding of the plate oh the
gravel, the tinkling shiver of its impact with it, if it
were pitched rather than rolled, and finally the
glorious crash as it hit the opposite wall, followed by
a hollow boom if the wooden door were successfully
achieved.


We started too early for safety, and it was not a
quiet game. We were all fined and gated for the rest
of term, and D-----, who made things worse by trying
to kill with a broken plate the porter and some don
who came up--we restrained him--was sent down for
good. But plates were put away properly after that,
and a scout was sacked for his carelessness.


The custom of bathing social delinquents still held,
but though brutal in detail, it was usually just in
intention and theory. One young gentleman, now
a master at a distinguished public school, coming
himself with prestige for knowledge and athletic
pursuits from another, was foolish enough, in his first
term, to be both arrogant and definitely rude to a

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Tyneham, you are wanted. You have disgraced
the whole freshers' year. We are going to bath you.
Come.”


He argued, but seeing the strength of his opponents,
came quietly enough. As he left the room,
he turned and said to his friend, “For the Faith,
Arthur.”


He and some others of his persuasion were wont to
hold open-air services on Sunday evenings, at various
points in the Oxford streets, rather in the Salvation
Army manner, and the brave, poor, young man
thought he was being martyred for it. The religious
services indeed were treated with flippancy and derision,
and, the megaphone having been newly invented,
colleges near the meeting places could interrupt quite
successfully and (I think it is fair to say) harmlessly.
But bodily or terrorising persecution for such a
liberal-minded offence against the general social code
would never have been thought of, nor tolerated if

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This ritual punishment was also inflicted, in our
third year, on two contemporaries for an odious
fault--that of corn-stalking. The worse of these two
gentlemen was an excellent scholar, and afterwards a
professor of economics at some Colonial university or
other. He was of repulsive appearance, and given to
leering. With his less repulsive companion, clad in
the height of the then fashion--so high that for him it
toppled over into vulgarity--wearing white trousers
and boots, with the general college colours on his
straw hat (not, of course, those of any college club or
team: he could not have got into them), he would
amble up and down the Cornmarket, ogling all and
every woman. This gave the college away: our
private vices might go on within the walls, but not in
public. So he, too, underwent the bath. To him
was added a certain damage of furniture (for which we
paid) and an exhibition of a pastime newly invented.
This consisted in setting the electric light (for we were
so advanced as to have it) swinging on its long string
across the room, and throwing the delinquent's books

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here I should say that in almost all our orgies we
kept within the college; and that n9 one in my time
went after women--certainly not in Oxford, for it
was dangerous, and the proctors saw to it that there
were few professionals available; I do not count
slight badinage at fairs in Gloucester Green or Port
Meadow, or squeezings in occasional crowds on
public occasions. No one at Sturminster while I
was up, so far as I know, went up to town illicitly
for the day to seek female companionship: there
were no motors, though the train service was better
then than now.


My own female companionship at Oxford was
scanty. My tutors' wives (for by then the sacrament
of marriage was legalised to some extent--I am told it
is now nearly universal) formed the main part of it. I
had no North Oxford connections. An occasional
sister of a friend might turn up, but none that I met
was at all exciting. Barmaids and teashop waitresses
did not allure me. But I had one affair. Jack
Steepleton had up for Eights Week some sort of relation
(an aunt, I think) with her daughter and niece.
Jack wanted the daughter, who was decidedly pretty
in a dreadful, tuberculous style--I should think she
had not many years to go. He got our unmarried
“Stinks” don, a sort of walrus who fancied himself
as a lady's man, to look after the old woman, and gave
me the niece, for whom I will borrow a name from

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shepherded the lot to the theatre. Jack took us
all for a lavish picnic in a punt and a Canader: as I
could not punt, but could canoe, I had Rose in my own
ship alone. Also we all went two by two round the
various colleges, and got separated in the gardens of
Worcester and St. John's and New College, and in the
river walks behind Magdalen.


We had an Eights Week concert at Sturminster that
year. I was a steward, so that I could not sit by her
with whom by then I was in some sort of love. But
after it was over I said bland words to the Stinks
walrus, a kindly soul, and got from him his private key
to the college gardens, for the use of Jack and myself:
he took the mother to a small coffee feast and said
nothing about us.


Rose and I sat on a bench in the light (or rather the
shadow) of a half-moon, in the utter silence of Oxford.
Not even the high trees rustled, though the flowers
were in such flagrant bloom that their dimly-seen
colour seemed almost like a sound. I said little or
nothing, but at last took her hand rather timidly, and
put my arm nervelessly round her waist. I became
aware that her plumpish form was pretty tightly
encased in stays, and, though I murmured “dearest,”
my affection grew less warm at the contact. She said,
“Kiss me.” So I did. I had not thought of it
before. I did it several times, without passion.
Then we arranged to write to one another at frequent

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I saw them off the next morning, but I never met
her again. We wrote for a few weeks, tepidly. Her
letters were in a characterless hand, and empty of any
interest of any kind: I cannot now imagine what
mine were like, nor how I managed to write them.
But it is hard for a rather monastic undergraduate
(sexually monastic, anyhow) not to fall mildly or even
wildly in love amid the perfect enchantments of a fine
Eights Week. She was quite pretty in a mixed doll-and-boy
style: she had a nice smile and really good
grey eyes.


When our correspondence languished, and died out
on her side, I guessed what had happened, and wasted
no stamps on expostulation. She had told me (for
we exchanged many confidences) that she was half
engaged to a well-to-do man whom she did not really
love. I supposed the half became a whole and grew
into wedlock. At any rate she married, as I discovered
years afterwards by a queer coincidence. She
used to sign her letters to me, with loving playfulness,
by a symbol: a sort of deformed cabbage which I
interpreted, no doubt rightly, as being a rose. Much
later, I was reading a number of trivial MSS. for one of
my firm's magazines, when I thought I recognised a
certain handwriting. The accompanying letter was
signed “Rose Jackson (Mrs.).” I looked at the MSS.
They all bore at the end that kittenish cabbage-like
emblem of her Christian name. I fear the letter
returning them was but a printed form. No pang
stabbed me.

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I ought, in resuming, to add to that anecdote of the
open-air preacher one of high moral courage in a
companion of his in missionary efforts. The senior
“close” scholar of my year at the college (I was the
senior “open”), at our worst period of excess, asked
“Jones” and myself, two leading spirits in riot,
athletics and scholarship, to come to Hannington
Hall with him one Sunday and lunch afterwards. We
liked and respected him (we both knew him well,
though he was no rioter), and accepted, rather mystified.
We went to an ultra-Low-Church service of
some kind, and had a pleasant teetotal lunch. After
it, P----- spoke to us very seriously, and very well.
He asked us to promise to set a better example. His
sincerity and goodness were plain, and I myself
certainly felt ashamed. But I knew I could make no
promise, and I said so. I <i>did</i> modify my transports
ever afterwards at Oxford, though I could not abandon
them; and I did not, while I was up, tell others why,
because they would only have laughed, which would
have been a bitter unfairness to a brave man. “Jones”
did--after he had made his promise, and became
outrageously pious, shuddering even at the sound of
“damn,” and kicking men for anything worse. He
relapsed in a fortnight.


The more corporate riots of the University, in
which all or several colleges shared, were those of
Mafeking night and a celebrated visit from four
Cambridge colleges at once to play their Oxford
opposite numbers at Rugger. I believe a severe check
has since been placed upon this kind of interchange of
matches. At that time they provided splendid games,

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Towards the end of my time proctors took to
meeting the trains of the returning teams or departing
visitors. They were certainly needed on this
four-college occasion. The L.N.W.R. station contained
sixty drunken and happy young men, hosts
and guests, plus camp-followers. All were singing,
and many gathering trophies (lamps, flags, foot-warmers,
and so on). I found myself helping a very
very famous international forward to dislodge an
automatic machine from its bearings. With the aid
of others, we got it into his college's saloon, amid
cheers. In an ecstasy, he fell upon my neck, nearly
knocking me down, and kissed me. Then we started
running races up and down the platform.


As the train started--with some difficulty, for the
teams insisted on shaking hands with everybody in
sight (including the porters, who were certainly the
richer for the evening)--it was whispered that all the
proctorial staff was outside. I had a stockinette
monkey-face head-covering in my pocket, preand
put it on at once. I could see through

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mafeking night was sheer chaos. In the Broad the
firemen turned the hose on the crowd at close quarters.
It was rushed from an angle, and cut to pieces, the
pieces being seized as trophies. Next day detectives
searched all the colleges for the remains. The nozzle
was in Sturminster, but with the connivance of the
buttery clerk (who was drunk earlier that day than
usual) it lay hid behind the sherry casks in the cellars,
until it could be restored and hung on its proud
owner's walls.


The only other corporate function I wish to recall
was not domestic. In the frenzy of the South African
War many of us joined the University Volunteers,
and drilled in the parks or our gardens in our preposterous
tight red uniform. It counted for virtue,
service to the endangered State being deemed equivalent
to service to God, even in our ecclesiastical
atmosphere: a pre-breakfast drill was ranked officially
as chapel attendance. Hitherto the “bugshooters”
(I understand that at Cambridge the corresponding
force shoots dogs) had been supported by
worms only; but now we were all patriots. Word
came, towards the end of the war, that the Great
Queen was dying, and suddenly she lay dead. I
heard of it early; and it is characteristic of her

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I played whist the night before, and became slightly
drunk. I did not go back to my rooms till 3 a.m.
and then had to stoke up my fire, pipeclay parts of my
uniform, button-stick my brass buttons, do my own
boots, arrange my underclothing, and finally to put a
hot-water can down by the fire. It was four before I
went to bed. We were to be called at six by our
indefatigable chief (the scouts would not be in college
till much later), get our own breakfast, and march to
the station for a train at seven. The train was late,
and took a long time to get to Slough, where we
detrained and marched to Windsor. We had an
hour's rest in some hall I do not remember, and then
had an issue of a pork pie and a pint of beer each.
These were served out in batches of four, and I was
the odd file in a four, so that I <i>got</i> four. I had conquered
two rations when we (...) marshalled again
and told our duties once more. (...) a short fall out
we formed up and marched to the astle--a laborious
matter, with the narrow streets full of troops and
spectators.


When we got there we were drawn up in a long
single line, and stood at ease in the cold morning for
what seemed an interminable time. Yet I think to all
of us, the more because of our tired minds and bodies,
the grave beauty and solemnity of the scene on that

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a hitch with the horses at Slough, and the
procession was late: when it came, it was all the more
impressive for being on foot. We heard suddenly
the unearthly beauty of Chopin's Funeral March as the
long array wound round the lower slopes of the Castle
Hill. Then they came in sight, going at a footpace.
We had just reversed arms and bowed our heads
according to the ceremonial of death. Nearer and
nearer came the Guards: then the coffin of the little
old woman who had been so great that she was part
of all our lives, and now was to be dust. After her,
on foot, the kings of the earth: the tall, bearded,
beaked, evil-looking old King of the Belgians, our
own new King, a little shrunken in form from his
former girth, the splendid figure of the Kaiser, and
many others I do not remember.


More troops, and so through the doors of the
glorious chapel. When they were shut, and we outside
heard the sharp “'Shun!” that took us out of the
mourning posture, the sound of the organ came
faintly to our ears, followed by dead silence as the
splendour of the Burial Service was read. In a few
minutes we were formed up and marched away, to
more pork pies and beer, and then to a train--this
time, thank heaven, from Windsor itself.


I suppose it was the reaction, but there was a queer,
excited hilarity about the college that night: we drank
a lot, but it did not seem to affect us, and we did no
ragging. We made oceans of coffee, but could do no
work, and played bridge or whist till Nature drove us

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So I left the Victorian era.


Such, my dear readers, you who issue from Lady
Maggy to punt gracefully on the Cher, or to go to
lectures in your so charming flabby Tudor caps, was
the pitch of civilisation we had reached less than twenty
years after your softening influence had first reached
us--“man is not at all good form,” as the Victorian
Gilbert had then said. Such, my valiant Rugger
scholar from Woolloomooloo, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_45608');">[note]</a><div id="_note_45608" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ “A suburb of Sydney” (gazetteer). I had this looked up for me. I
did not think a place with such a name could really exist. It does.--J. L. P.</div> was the high Imperial
ideal of our lives just before Great Britain went to war
in that portion of Africa whose wealth was so soon
to bring you from Australia to Oxford. The good
Queen was still alive until my last year. It was a
strange irony that a changed and livelier Oxford must
be left to grow up under her son and grandson.


These things are fit subject for reminiscence among
us older ones who shared in them: sad and happy
reminiscences, for we grow (...) while yet the
pleasure of common memories (...) delightful.
And maybe they are an admonition of mortality, now
that they are but memories. But they were not that
then.


Yet, though I have deliberately spoken of the baser
part of life in a dissolute college, I know that if I could
return now, just to go through the little archway into

<b>(ii)<br />
SEEING LIFE UNSTEADILY</b>


“Light half-believers of our casual creeds.”


Matthew Arnold, <i>The Scholar Gipsy</i>.


I HAVE said that the Victorian era was over for me,
in the bosom of my family, when I laughed at their
narrow fears over the episode of the Diamond Jubilee;
and for me as a man, when the Queen was borne to St.
George's Chapel, and, a term later, I came down from
Oxford.


By then (on attaining twenty-one years) I had
come into a small income of about £200 a year, left me
by a great-aunt whose son, snatched away when he was
only twelve, I had been supposed to resemble in mind
and body; it is just as well his mind had no chance to
carry the resemblance further. My mother had died
just before I went to Oxford, (...) of pride in my
scholarship and athletic feats, (...) so full of a charitable
understanding of my vanity as well as of my weakness.
My father, less sympathetic by intuition, but
not less proud, followed her to the grave (the correct
phrase of the period, I believe, though the pursuit is
usually involuntary) in my first year at Sturminster,
leaving his sister Kate my legal guardian till I came of
age. I was therefore fairly independent on going
down.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decided to enter for what was then almost an
Oxford preserve--the First Class Clerkships in the
Home and Indian Civil Service; but also, <i>ad interim</i>,
to do some independent job-hunting. I did not like
the idea of doing nothing. My father's successor
could use my services in a part-time way, in connection
with his magazines, which had now borne children
and seemed likely to increase the paper population
still further, for the growing firm (in which I now
held some shares) had early recognised the value of
“turnover” as well as profits. But I would rather
for a main interest have something a little more sincere
and interesting: purveying words for fools, housemaids,
and babies, with one's tongue in one's cheek,
soon becomes wearisome. I also hated the business
side of it. Yet somehow I could not help executing
that kind of legerdemain (for hire by the business men)
with all my might and skill, whenever I turned to it.
There was a devilish fascination about it.


I went to that crammer's where Herr Dr. Büste
lectured so forcibly, and in all probability should have
got into the Home Civil Service with some ease but for
a curious Nemesis. A fellow-examinee innocently
misinformed me (I did not trouble to verify details) as
to the day of a particular paper--a “cram” paper, for
which one refreshed the memory the night before. It
came a day earlier than my informant said. I could
answer hardly a question in it, when I came to the
appointed hour, because I had not touched the subject
for a fortnight. The lost (potential) marks made
the difference of two places--I was two below in the
final list for home jobs.

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was the Nemesis. The innocent deceiver
was one of those whom, in my second year, I had
invested with a very different order of the bath from
that which he now wears. He had been forced to
sign an ignominious document which ended “and I
declare I am a worm and no man.” I still have the
document. But there he is, a Permanent Secretary,
and here am I, an ex-inmate of Broadwindsor Hall, not
eligible for an automatic C.B., a C.B.E., or even an
I'm So Old. I wonder which is the real “worm”?
I do not blame him for what, I am sure, and always was
sure, was a wholly unintentional mistake. But he
certainly turned effectively.


So I was left to job-hunting, small private means,
and as much casual paid work for the firm as I
pleased. Job-hunting, to shy persons like me, coming
from no great school and with no inherited name
or friendships, was a wavering between audacity, on
the one hand, and suspense and hopelessness on the
other.


For some time I got nothing. I have never been
able to understand how people squirm into posts for
which they have no ostensible (...) at first,
however well they may fill them (...). They
sit on the doorstep until the door opened, I suppose,
like the Frog Footman. My academic qualifications
were good enough, and I know I had a reasonable
amount of all-round ability as well as warm
Oxford recommendations. But I never could abide
the doorstep. I simply presented my credentials,
answered the questions I was asked, and went away
and waited for the verdict--which did not always

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most of the possible openings were for secretaries of
sorts. I was to learn in maturer years, from the other
end, how full the world is of potential secretaries.
There must be nearly as many “secretaries” as
“organisers.” Anyhow, at that time I did not become
either. My first chance of doing something for
myself came through what I had believed to be a
friendly chance invitation to a week-end with my
tutor. I found when I got to Oxford that it was certainly
an act of friendship, as well as of his always
charming and thoughtful courtesy. He had a double
opportunity for me; and if I had not been, in the
event, too eager to use it with the utmost of my rather
shallow vivacity, I might have turned the chances into
very considerable openings. As it was, they meant a
fair amount of money, a good deal of experience, and
an increment of my still boyish joy in life: the Oracle
of the Bottle had not yet condemned me to death.


The possibility now put near to me was semijournafistic.
The assistant editor of a vigorous but
struggling London morning paper wanted a regular
(piecework) book-reviewer, capable also of writing
occasional short “leaders” or “leader-notes,” as the
technical speech of those days went (there have been
a thousand changes since). He had asked my tutor
to suggest someone. I was recommended for it, and
I think wisely; for after a very brief trial I was discovered
to possess the vital quality of “snap” as a
reviewer. I had still enough youth and enthusiasm
to write vivaciously about our new star, G. K. Chesterton,

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it was not only the new work in itself which was
interesting. It was the experience of skill and craft.
I felt a quick change in my bones. The trade conditions
were the real joy. “Snap!” It only meant
going back to Aristotle's canon, and adding to its
balance, and to some kind of quick justice, a few
qualities from the scorpion and the dove: a Beginning,
a Middle, an End, in about three hundred words
full of snap. The Beginning must show that you are
not really writing about the book at all, but displaying
familiarity with its theme. The Middle <i>must</i>---oh
heavens, if only the clever allusive reviewers would
realise that essential!--<i>must</i> say what the book is
about. Say it allusively, delicately, flippantly, as you
please; not baldly, unless you (...) “criticising” a
prosperous literary sausage-(...) when it doesn't
matter. But say it quite <i>clearly</i>, (...) a cloud of ink.
From the Middle to the End lies a Bridge which your
journal's advertisement manager watches very closely,
for his and the paper's security. It consists of a
sentence that the publisher of the book can quote in
the advertisements which that manager will at once
wring out of him if it is quotable. It must be what the
Bun Emperor, in Mr. Robert Hichens' funny preSheik

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A crude example of a Bridge is readily invented.
Here is one: the portions in brackets are those usually
omitted from quotations in the publisher's advertisements,
which, if the notice were good, might in those
days have run to an eighth or even quarter double
column per book for best-sellers. “(On the whole)
Mr. Pole's book is excellent (within the limitations of
its subject). All who are interested in such problems
(though we hope they are few) will read it eagerly.”


So to the End, the dove having been thus found a
suitable cote on the Bridge. The scorpion now
emerges. It is necessary for the snappy reviewer to
enumerate all the misprints he can find, trot out some
little crumb of sham learning (a few seconds at the
British Museum would suffice a pupil of Dr. Büste),
abuse the author for omitting it, and for any trivial
slip in grammar he discovers, and (preferably) mate
with the dove in a patronising farewell. So, pretty
often, flows under the executioner the precious lifeblood
of a master-spirit.


I did well over a thousand novels a year in that way.
They took about twenty minutes each. (I exclude
serious and larger works for the moment, but they also
often contained matter easy to the expert slaughterer.)
Yet I do not know that I was ever unjust--save once,
when the commercial depravity of the paper took the
matter out of my hands. As soon as I had proved my

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Happily, I did not immediately sell the volume, and
so when I got a friendly note from the editor a few
days later, I was able to send it back; he said advocates
of the lobster cause had asked for a lengthy review of
it, and he hardly thought I should be sympathetic
enough for that. Which was true. But a few days
later still, I got a cheerful second note, which ended,
“when you give back a book after you have sent in
the review, it is wise, as evidence of good faith, to cut
the pages before returning it.”

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He admitted afterwards that I had allotted to the
book what it deserved. Akin to this episode, but
rather more outrageous, was the case of the famous
patent medicine, Dr. Liverpool's Gripe-water: you
know the huge advertisement in the more pious newspapers
--“Grannie, the Little One has Colic! Tell
Mother how <i>you</i> cleansed the Little Bowel--with Dr.
Liverpool's Gripe-water. Grannies always KNOW!”


I was given for review, very early in the Christmas
season--not, as usual, of my choice, but as it were a
card forced into my hand--a book of short stories for
children, called, I think, <i>Aunt Kitty's Bed-time Tales</i>.
It was published by some firm I had never heard of,
and contained for frontispiece a photograph of a doll-like
maiden whose virtue or whose sanity (alternativly)
I am sure I should have suspected if I had ever
met her in real life: though I should not have been
allowed or have wished to tempt the one or explore
the other.


“You <i>must</i> do that,” said my editor. “Give it
two sticks.”


Oh, hell,” I answered. “Why? It's some d--d
P.S.A. tripe. Look--<i>look!</i> The preface is headed
‘To the dear Kiddies.’ My good man, children's
books are bad enough, but-----”


“It's very important,” he said obstinately.


My reply was a short word not usually printed,
though harmless in other contexts.


“But it <i>is</i> important,” he said. “<i>I tell</i> you it <i>is</i>.”


“Why?”


“Oh, well, if you <i>must</i> know, Levi [the advertisement
manager] says so.”

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Oh. . . .”


“Yes. It's by the niece of Dr. Liverpool's Gripewater,
and they have a half-page ad. once a week and
a half-column as well pretty often. Don't you
<i>see?</i>”


“Yes, but I'm d--d if I'll do it. Get some one on
the staff for that sort of thing. This isn't a piece of
work for a piece-work man.”


And he took the refusal quietly, and it made no
difference to our trustful relations. The book got its
two sticks, and they made it appear that <i>Alice</i> was
obsolete and Grimm and Hans Andersen not worthy
of exhumation. It was the best butter.


There were one or two other flagrant pieces of
jobbery like that, and since the War it has become
fairly obvious that except in a very few incorruptible
journals the advertisement manager (whether his
intended prey is a publisher or the distiller of gripewater,
with his offensive arch domesticity) subtly
controls the book-reviews to a great extent. I
remember that at a time (...) was much rivalry
between certain flamboyan (...), one of them hit
upon literature as an undeveloped asset. This was
before the days when you can get £1,000 (insurance
money) for a cut finger, because the <i>Daily Bellow</i>
desires a greater circulation--that is, a higher price
from credulous, hypnotised advertisers, who keep it
going and make its profits--than the <i>Daily Snort</i>.
But even in that dim, pre-War era it had become
obvious that revenue did not depend on scoops, nor
even on the hypertrophy of stunts, but on continuous
noise. What would make a new noise (presently to

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“An ear?” said the manager. “I see.” He had
never heard of an ear: nor had I--I chanced to be
present. “How much will that be?”


“Oh, <i>you</i> know: you pick out the book you like
best in your ad. and write your own review of it.
We'll give you two sticks if you take a quarter-doublecolumn,
and will look after the rest of your list as well
as we've space for.”


We had enough self-respect to tell him to go away
at once--politely, for at least he was frank.


I am sure the eminent literary man knew nothing of
this indecent higgling. But-----. However, I am
told to-day's methods are more subtle. It does not
matter to me. The improving works issued under my
Own name are impregnable, immune alike to butter or
shot. My pseudonymous novels (the secret of which
I am just about to reveal) are just a safety-valve for my

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was not thus in all my own criticisms. I read or
wrote about new books by unknown men carefully,
and I spotted many winners. (I am sorry for the
phrase, but my journal, being out for moral uplift, had
the best racing specialist in London, and the elementary
slang of those far-off days has wriggled into my
normal vocabulary.) I never slaughtered an innocent
nor laughed at a newcomer. Better silence than
that easy indecency of (...).


I think, nevertheless (...) must be some taint of
literary crime in my blood. A great-uncle, a doctor
of divinity, once head of a training college in Victoria's
day, scrupled not to lay the foundations of the moral
tale business which my father developed so well, by
means of what an ingenious writer has since called
“Christian Dreadfuls”; nor to adopt a false clerical
name for many little tracts and catechisms, nor to
take the profits arising from this sale of the transmuted
Word of the Galilean. My father, I fear, obtained the
same sort of material cheaply--very cheaply--from

My father's manager--“our Mr. Walditch”--
believed also, and equally (or should it be less?) credulously,
in this sort of thing--in ten per cent.
Christianity. He thought it “did good.” Personally
I thought it did no active good except to persons
already quite goody-goody enough, and did active
harm by uglifying beauty and pretending that real
ugliness did not exist. But I had no more scruple
than my forbears in making money out of it, and when
I felt hilarious--two pints of beer about four o'clock
in the afternoon (this was before the restrictions which
it is so amusing and so demoralising to evade) were a
fine stimulant--I could turn out a <i>Susan's Repentance</i>
or <i>Cleverness and Goodness</i> almost in two or three hours
before dinner. I ate--and drank--the more heartily
for it, and being more or less in the firm, saw that these
efforts paid for really good dinners, over which I
could discuss with irreverent friends how soon I
should give good little Willie tuberculosis (still called
“a decline”), or get bad Tommy converted by the
agency of a runaway horse. This kind of work, out

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could do as much or as little of this as I pleased.
When I came of age, after my father's death, I was, as
I have said, a partner, but not tied to a salaried post.
I eventually took a part-time one as assistant editor of
some of our pious magazines. It is fair, I think, to
say that in that capacity I showed whatever was in me
of sympathy, pity and discretion. The most flippant
cynic cannot treat as a humbug a man who, on a cold
day, pulls up a dickey and shows his bare skin underneath,
and implores you to buy his rubbishy story.
The artists were even more painful, in some ways, for
the great transition in book and magazine illustration
was at its critical point. The wood-block, that even
now underrated glory of the 'sixties, was virtually
dead (the modern revival is a new baby or a very long
throw-back, not a restored and recent corpse). Yet
our older artists were men who had worked with the
burin and graver under Landells and the Dalziels,
who had known Sir John Gilbert, just remembered
Sam Williams, thought book-illustration culminated
in the aged Cruikshank and had already begun to
deteriorate with Fred Walker, Hughes and Millais.
They could just adapt themselves to work in wash, for,
after all, much drawing on wood had been executed in
that medium or partly. They had also a sure touch in
line. But in neither had they the slick certainty that
“process” and direct line reproduction so quickly

And indeed, if I had not been young, and at first a
little horrified at this hitherto unplumbed stagnancy of
life, I should have had small pity myself, for the reaction
against Victorian gods and creeds was instantaneous,
and far sharper and more contemptuous then

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was anxious not to hurt my aunt's feelings--
though, by an odd irony, she was unwittingly a public
critic of my immoral work and got into trouble for
her courage--or to damage my firm's semi-religious
prestige. But I did enjoy writing those books, and am
not in the least ashamed of them.


So I grew quickly into three persons <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_74268');">[note]</a><div id="_note_74268" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ An irreverent comment is here omitted.--K. L. P.</div>--a general

I wish life had not been so easy. I had here at
the outset my chance. But levity struggled against
enthusiasm, and killed it, to its own ultimate destruction
as well. We had amusing times, I and the friends
I then had. Most of those friends are now dead, and
my amusements are no longer such as they would have
gladly shared.


In itself--at least outwardly--my existence was not
unhealthy. I had better give a few practical details.


On my father's death the three remaining members
of the family--two others, as I have said, had died a
good while before--lived on in his house (now our
joint property) with our kindly young guardian aunt as a
sort of foster mother and matron. How she did distrust
me! Quite rightly. But I believe I was her favourite.


My sister I strongly suspected of designs on a
slightly corpulent young stockbroker with a waxed
moustache: she married him some years after I came
down from Oxford, and has borne him several children
at New Barnet (the newest part). They were
unpleasing brats, when young, and my own marriage
and way of life kept me out of their way, especially
when I had lost count of them and mislaid my note of
their birthday dates. Besides, I don't like stockbrokers
as relations--nor in any capacity.

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My brother, the youngest of us, decided that he
must preach the Gospel, and took Holy Orders. He
was completely sincere in this. Fortunately, he had a
share in the paternal legacies, and married a good but
humourless wife who also had a little money. But for
that (because after his first curacy he only got an underpaid
and overworked London living) he would have
had a very hard, if honourable, life, birth control being
uncommon among the inferior clergy. I was able,
quite honestly, to lend him aid in the less dogmatic
part of his work some years later. I respect him, and
old intimacy coupled with respect is to all intents and
purposes affection.


Myself, soon after leaving Oxford, I decided, upon
a whim, to go into residence for a time at Spettisbury
House, one of the youngest and most influential of
University Settlements in Darkest London. I was
there for about three years, seeing some real life and
obtaining much interesting “copy.” It had an odd
influence upon me--not at all that which its
enthusiasm-of-humanity founder intended. Then, for
reasons to be described later, I took a small flat in
Chelsea. I had a sufficient income to do as I pleased
within reason, and it soon grew.


So the tides of the world received my bark. Like
the gentleman in the poem, I cried “I am afloat! I am
afloat!” It is true I had no great cargo, and a very
defective rudder. But I thought little of that. The
sea into which I put off might lead me beyond the
baths of all the western stars, or be just a jolly expanse
of little crisp dancing waves. I did not know. As
yet, the waters but winked with innumerable laughter.

SERIOUS REFLECTIONS</b>


“‘Ah, Sir,’ said the dervise, ‘a house that changes its inhabitants
so often, and receives such a perpetual succession of guests,
is not a palace, but a caravansary.’”


Joseph Addison, <i>The Spectator</i>.


IT is difficult even for those who suffered from it to
define the epidemic of good works and high ideals
which followed upon the lofty but somewhat strait
attempts of King Edward VII.'s father to give England
a social, industrial and artistic conscience. Very
possibly the three types of that vegetable growth
cannot be united in one flower. But the culture was
earnest and persistent. Its progress perhaps was like
that seen two generations before, when John Howard,
Elizabeth Fry and Wilberforce had dared to feel the
enthusiasm of humanity (a mid-Victorian term, by the
way), and had been succeeded by Mr. Chadband, Mr.
Gradgrind, Mrs. Jellyby. So, too, Arnold Toynbee
(and at least two other Arnolds), Sir John Seeley,
Charles Booth, and a few other legatees of the Prince
Consort's desire to do good (<i>ad majorem Britanniæ
gloriam</i>) led us in the long run into an Utopia of
Garden Cities, Tory Democracy, Charity Organisation,
Employment Exchanges, Brotherhoods, and, at
last, with the aid of the now respectable Stage, Flag
Days.

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The pedigree is long and slow, but authentic. I
became interested in the family just when its origins
were growing misty and its future insecure. I do not
know by what process of self-humbug I arrived at
Spettisbury House, which had a considerable tract of
Wapping and Limehouse for its kingdom of sweetness
and light. The spiritual ferment was probably
stirred by more than one of those missionary visits by
which the zealots of Toynbee Hall, Oxford House, and
other of the senior settlements tried to catch the
undergraduate in a wild state, and show him (or let
him learn) what life was and how much better he
could make it. Spettisbury House was one of the
newer foundations, but its head was an old Sturminster
man of strong personality. Through my tutor, his
old friend, I met him privately as well as heard his
appeal to the college in general. He got me. It
would be possible to suspect that subtle flattery entered
into his suggestion that in developing my own wisdom
by residence under him I should also be a strong prop
of a great cause: and anyway, I could do my own work
there, as well as that of handing on the torch.


The place, it seemed to me very soon in my period of
residence there, had the advantage of continuing, in a
way at once more febrile and more feeble, the companionableness
and critical discipline of Oxford life.
But that was not my first impression, nor my stimulus.
Life in such a settlement was to be a piece of experience,
certainly an approach to reality. I was cocksure
enough (Greats makes you either that or humble
and diffident) to think I had plenty of the philosophy
of experience, and it remained only to collect more raw

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fact is that I had not the least idea what I meant
to make of my life, nor how I could most happily use
my quite respectable powers. In that, perhaps, I was
a creature of transition, not stubborn enough to stand
by the past, nor fierce enough to wish to make the
future. You young persons of to-day, who get this
book from the library, along with other publicly-washed
linen of all kinds offered by so many new
laundries, can hardly realise that even in 1902 or
thereabouts it was unusual to have no principles.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I never got beyond the first vague altruism that led
me to Spettisbury House. No flame was lit in me. I
do not know whether it was lucky or unlucky that the
House was attached to no religious denomination.
It depended too much, maybe, on the soul's awakening,
without a creed. The only religious fervour I
ever heard of there was that of an Anglo-Indian
<i>revenant</i> from the blouse's earlier days, who left
because the principal asked him to take charge of
classes--semi-debating talks--on Sabbath mornings
for the benefit of persons too ragged and dirty to go
to church (even if they had wanted to), or too lazy to
rise until they had to go and prop up the doorposts
of the public-houses for a quarter of an hour before
opening time. Do good, yes: spread truth and
light. But not at the time of Sunday solemnities.
John Haslebury (even then C.I.E., and now K.C.S.I.)
was, I recall, a British-Israel devotee: Low Church,
but much admired.


You were not expected to give up your whole time
to loving your fellow-men. In the day you worked
for your own living according to your circumstances,
except for a few whole-time philanthropists or at the
occasional periods of concentration. The evening,
after the boringly vivacious six-thirty “dinner” at
the common board (cocoa and bread and cheese and
whisky and beer later), was the period of fury.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was interesting, in a way. The word Bolshevism,
remember, was still unknown (it was as long ago as all
that). Socialism was a terrific menace: anarchists
were still spoken of, and though Mr. Gladstone was
dead, many faces yet turned from orange to purple at
the mere mention of Home Rule. Our few Conservative
residents, facing poor East End Irishmen at the
debates, were apt to be derided, as were their comrades-in-arms
who tried to press Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's
fiscal views upon students of political economy to
whom the daily price of bread really mattered. Most
of us were explorers who thought chiefly of making
bad better: neither abolishing it nor trying to revive
lost causes.


But in the long run the life became irksome. It
was, in spite of our undenominationalism, the old
round of the vicar and doctor of my suburban days.
There was no change, in spite of my talk of transition:
or was the change coming unseen from within? At
any rate, I soon lost the freshness of curiosity about my
odd, haphazard, unselected fellow-residents. We did
not always settle down (with our more mobile population)
as a school or college can, as sheep and rabbits
do. Further, I had exhausted my appetite for
novelty. The ignorance of the evening-class students
whom I taught had ceased to be exciting, our concerts

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And finally I was almost imperceptibly becoming
aware that I was a man in a physical sense. By a not
unnatural irony the celibacy of the place was in some
sort an aphrodisiac. My friends both there and outside
were beginning to get engaged or to look forward
to marriage. Even the arid females who helped
at our Spettisbury social functions seemed to be rather
more than mere gauche dance partners or purveyors of
violin solos. There were handsome, bold, friendly
coster girls in the streets, and an infiltration of dark,
plump Jewesses. Many of my pupils were young
married clerks, and their wives came to our parties.
It is true that in their deportment they were but little
removed from the kittenish young things already
made ridiculous by the imitators of Dickens: their
archness was as Victorian as their sleeve-frills and high
muslin collars (sleeves were worn then, you know, and
the V-shaped depressions between the shoulders, even
with alleged evening dress, were very short and
narrow). The maids of the House were designedly
chosen for ugliness and (what does not always go with

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Besides, there are no proctors in London, and my
more and more frequent abstentions from the Spettisbury
routine enabled me to see quite other types of
woman, about whom I had better say a little, because
we in those days had not your neo-Georgian freedom,
and you can hardly know how discreet our indiscretions
had to be. Piccadilly is safe for democracy:
Jimmy's, the Empire, and the Continental are all
gone.


“‘Many conquests, sir?’” asked Mr. Tracy
Tupman on a celebrated occasion. I escaped that
Victorian idea of conquest, which brought a good
many people of my age into the world, and still more
of the age which preceded it. “Conquest” was
always to me entirely abhorrent. Whenever, in
moments of lust and youth, I went “home” with a
woman (which was very seldom indeed), I sickened of
it before I entered her frowsy, stuffy, patchouli-ed
bedroom--after the dirty business of paying for it to
some evil-eyed retired professional. She might “impeticos
my gratillity” willingly, but not more.


I paid, and remained much more innocent, but not
better, than she. I had hired her for a short time, on
an impulse, but I did not seek to implement the bargain,
for the impulse was brief. Ah, bah! Her lipstick
that came off with her false kiss. . . . And now
the merest bread-and-butter miss uses lipstick as a
matter of course. I had no use for that kind of thing

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I always found such persons extremely interesting
to talk to, and that without much sexual excitement.
They knew the world (or much of it) and had
no unnecessary artifices, when once you had paid
them, or, in the then Leicester Lounge, when you had
stood a couple of drinks for a short conversation.
It has always seemed to me ridiculous to cover up
(by hinting at) this sort of perfectly well-known thing
by hints or moral treatises, or even to write an <i>Esther
Waters</i> or a <i>Mrs. Warren's Profession</i>--both obsolete as
moral treatises, if interesting as literature. The practice
is practical, when you come down to brass tacks.
Some men are bound by convention, as well as by
honourable beliefs, to a physical restraint which may
react in damnable meannesses in other directions;
some by a physical fear developed from moral faith;
some are, frankly, swine. Some women, up to and at
the climacteric, are voracious, and others determined
anchoresses: a few last on greedily into mature
years, like the Wife of Bath (I have met her in real
life: she killed her fifth husband). I think there are
far more “good” than “bad” of both sexes (the
inverted commas are deliberate). But to be blind to
the facts is to be ignorant of casual talk in a third-class
(even a first-class) railway carriage, or of the Amaravati

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

You must still remember, dear young ladies--and I
cannot nowadays suggest that you should skip this
chapter--that under Victoria there were plenty of
street-walkers, plenty of houses like those in Chelsea
(soon to be my home) which got W. T. Stead into
jail when he discovered near relations of the All-Highest
in them: plenty also of those Beautiful-and-Good
ladies of society whose memoirs (the half of
which was not told to us) the same journalist-reformer
reviewed savagely under the title, “These be thy
Gods, O Israel!” But we pretended this sort of
thing was not there, until a vigorous lady discovered
vice in the thick woollen tights worn as nudity in
“Living Pictures.” It required a later reign to see
really bare legs and a few stomach-beads on the stage.
Try to think back into our dim twilight. To-day,
after the War, clothing is of no more account than

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is theory or historical philosophy. I must get
back to a crude fact of my Spettisbury life--to my first
real vision of the extreme which the moralists rightly
fear. It was on the steps of a church close to the
settlement that an appalling drab (sleeping there)
offered me her person for a pint of beer. The church,
being in a poor neighbourhood, was shut, and
“there was no room in the inn” for persons of her
profession. The outside wall of the church bore a
famous mosaic of a bland allegorical type, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_95258');">[note]</a><div id="_note_95258" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ This church, having outlived its uses, such as they were, has been
pulled down. The mosaic has been transferred to another, nearer more
aristocratic scenes of vice.--J. L. P.</div> by an
eminent Victorian, to warn either her ox me, or perhaps
both, that at last we must meet death and be
judged. The market price of the lady, however,
seemed to me to be too high for the goods. But I
remembered that, not very many years before, the
inmates of the settlement had aided the police by
going out in couples at night, in gym-shoes, to patrol
in search of the most famous of all sexual murderers,

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All that is a jumble of terror and vice, and I have
designedly made it so. Some lust is beastly: extreme
lust is madness: good lust is love, and no sacrament of
marriage can alter that--the unrevised marriage
service stresses it.


Yet, I wonder. I have spoken of my early “love”
affairs with not even adolescents. Why did those
queer impotent appetites come? Is there really something
in Freud after all? Of course, it was all discovered
by Havelock Ellis before we English got
Freud; but Ellis's book is harder to come by than
Freud's--and was suppressed. I read it in our virtuous
settlement on loan from a most respectable civil
servant (the son of a bishop), who married his typist
and has no children: he is now an assistant-director
of education in some county in Wales with four
“w's” in it, several “c's” and many “ll's.” That
furtively-won knowledge was a long way from holding
hands with little girls over fireworks, at an age

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Whether I suffered from any complex or inhibition I
know not. My nearest approach to grown-up love
(both words ought to be in inverted commas) had
been that futility with Rose Maylie. But such experiences
as were now within my reach made me desire at
least a freer companionship with the other sex than I
had yet known, or than Spettisbury House seemed
likely to afford. And it came through one who was to
alter my whole life--unless I had already predestined
its course, for I did not leave thirst behind me at
Oxford, and gradually grew more luxurious in my
meals, more ready to prolong them with “foreign
wines and spirits,” to add to them theatres and musichalls
and endless games at bridge over ever-ready
bottles. I slipped insensibly, as my income from
miscellaneous writing grew, into a complete lover of
easy conditions, and I came to hate both the squalor

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It happened that by the kindness of my tutor I had
been elected a member of a very charming club--the
Meiotherium, which prided itself on keeping up a
supply of young men promising in some decent walk of
life as well as in social desirability. My tutor guaranteed
me on those grounds, and without pretence I did
my best to justify him. The private life of the
Meiotherium was such that within its walls reserve or
an eremitical tendency was an offence, and I made
many new acquaintances of divers kinds and ages.
The older members were as friendly as the young--
perhaps more so, being less shy--and while of course
one could doze in an armchair in the Athenæo-Victorian
manner, the practice was exceptional. The
general qualification for membership was the vague
term “social,” but by a judicious method of election
the club maintained a fairly equal proportion between
artists, authors, musicians, the higher physicians and
surgeons, barristers, scientists, civil servants, and the
like. There were few clergy, practically no actors,
and stockbrokers were sparse; journalists had to be
of the secret higher distinction of which the readers of
the cheap Press are ignorant.


Among those elected at the same time as myself
(a close acquaintance with a good many members was
essential to election) was a friend of my own age who
had passed high into the Civil Service from Oxford--
Hugh Bradford-Peverell, of the War Office: now a
Companion of the Bath. (Another was Peter Grimstone. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_101262');">[note]</a><div id="_note_101262" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ John Pole's description of the Club is accurate. Its reception of young
members was different from that accorded them in any similar institution I
know. He does not, however, allow quite enough for his own attractiveness.
His cynicism was always amusing, but few of us took it seriously. I
do not, even now.--P. G.</div>)

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was not long before he asked me to dine at his
house in Chelsea and to play bridge afterwards. He
had one other son, a year or two older than Hugh--
Geoffrey, a Cambridge man, a Fellow of King's, who,
after outrageous adventures in the War we did not
then expect, became a great traveller--and one
daughter, Penelope, two years younger than Hugh
and myself. Penelope at that time seemed to me the
perfectly English girl--entirely frank and open, with
no art but that of a natural hostess. Her mother had
died about the same time as my own. I knew Lady
Bradford-Peverell only by photographs which hinted
at a grave, old-fashioned charm. She had, I believe,
been a famous Irish beauty, as a girl, in the self-contained
austerities of Dublin society.


I became a fairly frequent visitor at the house, and
the summer after my election to the Meiotherium
went, more or less at their suggestion, to stay at a little
fishing-village in the west of England, where they

It marked the great difference that came into social
life with the accession of Edward VII. that an eager
curiosity supplanted the Victorian reticence. Sir
Arthur Bradford-Peverell was indeed of the older
generation, but he himself shared in this curiosity,
without, however, so much frank simplicity as his
daughter's. Rather was he a wise elder trying to comprehend,
without necessarily criticising, the younger
folk. Me he may have regarded--I think he did--
as something of a novelty. He asked me a good many
questions--or better, drew out of me the unasked
answers--about my curious literary work, laughing
at it, and not blaming me for enjoying it, but at the
same time conveying to me a certain sense of the need
for sincerity. As a very young man--indeed, as a
boy, for he had not yet quite reached the Civil Service
retirement age--he had known Frederick Denison
Maurice and some of his circle: the founders, really,
of the broad and humane Christian Socialism which a
quarter of a century ago was not much more than
middle-aged, and still suspect by many Church-people

But I did not confess all my lack of conscience even
to so kind a critic. “Vincent Snargate,” of course,
was still a few years distant: I had to learn a little
more about social usage and the craft of letters before
he could burgeon. But I was already a “ghost.”
I had come into friendly contact with a book-dealer
who made a small side-line of buying review copies,
and a main trade of real books, with a betwixt-and-between
of fakes and vamped-up reprints. As
“Coningsby Legge” I had done two or three quite
good scholarly introductions for his large-paper
editions of dubiously moral classics. He had, however,
several wealthy clients--purchasers of such
editions as well as of genuine odds and ends of rarity
and “curiosity”--who wished to pose as writers.
These gentlemen from time to time put forth handsomely-bound
little essays on such subjects as <i>The
World of Aphra Behn, The Hell-Fire Club</i>, and so on,
making a pretty name among their friends for the
taste and knowledge shown in the elegant brochures.
But I wrote them, or several of them. It was great
fun; it increased my rapidly-widening knowledge of
literature and history; and as neither the book-dealer

Sir Arthur, as I say, learnt nothing of this. He
merely laughed tolerantly when he saw me go off to
the beach with an arm-load of novels for review, a
writing pad, a fountain-pen, and bathing things, and
come back for lunch with the reviews done; usually
accompanied by Hugh, Penelope, Peter Grimstone
and others in a high state of hilarity over the swift
judgments of Rhadamanthus and the absurdity of the
Press. At the same time, they all took my word that
this or that new book by an unknown author was
really worth reading; and between us (for, of course,
I gave them odds and ends whenever they asked for
them) we kept quite a good collection of modern first
editions, now marketable for no mean sum.


They were all--except a few like Peter, who already
knew and visited the place from time to time--
interested in my “work” at Spettisbury House (now,
alas, so rapidly dwindling under influences like theirs,

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was Penelope herself who put on me the final
straw. It is perhaps fortunate that she did so, for
though I should have left the House pretty soon in any
case, I might have drifted earlier into the joyful
excesses which keep Broadwindsor Hall populous.
After many suggestions and even requests, which with
some sincerity as well as some social dread I put off as
best I could, she and a cousin came to See Life as It
is Lived (I had invented this term for their benefit in
mock-glory of our principles).


As the daughter and niece of so well-known a public
servant as Sir Arthur Bradford-Peverell, they were
honoured guests, to be placed on a level with lecturers
on housing conditions, secretaries of garden
suburbs, assistant editors of important journals, and
the like. To them came the mutton before the gravy
had congealed into fat, the less soused strata of cauliflower,
the complete supply of toast. And the brown
water called coffee, served in the terrific drawing-room
before our young bees hurried off to gather honey,
reached them, mercifully, in so hot a condition that
they could not drink it. As they tried to do so, the
(paid) secretary of the House engaged them in graceful
conversation. “So you have come to lighten our
darkness at last, have you, Miss Peverell? “he said in
his most charming manner. “Pole has often told us
you wanted to see the wild beasts.” Here he laughed
at his four-times-a-week-joke-for-visitors. “Your
father was never a resident here, was he? I expect he
knows Sir John Bettiscombe, of the Home Office?”

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Poor Mangerton was an efficient secretary on the
office side. But as a human being . . . I had always
despised him, as one despises harmless worms: but
now I suddenly saw him as a slug exuding green foam.
He afterwards became head of some new mixed school
run on principles born after a slow period of gestation
at Boston, Mass. He wrote a book about it, and
also about the principles. So far as I could discover,
the general idea was to blend Buddhism, the Return
to Nature, Moral Uplift, the Sunlight Treatment,
Simple Desires and Undenominational Christianity,
starting with ordinary children of eight and ending,
presumably, in their illegitimate descendants. Mangerton
stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the
Liberal (pre-War Lloyd George) interest, and can still
be heard twittering fluently but rather oilily on the
more sanctimonious kind of platform.


Penelope had sat at dinner between a huge hairy
Jew, who usually forgot to do up all his buttons,
breathed heavily and adenoidally, and wore soup and
tobacco on his chest, and a Winchester man of sleepy
appearance, who had no manners and dressed like a
tramp, but looked like a gentleman. I did not ask

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Except for a short friendly note thanking me, I did
not hear her views till I met her for a short walk in
Chelsea before dinner about a week later. “Well,
Johnny,” she said--we had long been intimate enough
for that--“the sooner you get away from that place
the better, unless you're so keen as all that.”


“What's the matter with it?” I asked, more indignantly
than I felt. “You didn't see much of it really
--none of the best of it. You came on a bad night.
Of course, I couldn't help that. I wish there'd been
more of the real people to show you-----”


“Like that crawler, Bettiscombe?” she asked,
mischievously: then more gently: “No, John, I
mean it isn't good for you. If you like, you--you're
too good for it. You-----”


“Oh, rot, Pen,” I interrupted, with a moment's
sincerity. “No one can be. It's quite true I'm
getting sick of it, though.”


“Yes,” she answered quickly, “that's just it. You
get sick of most things quickly.” She had a horrible
insight at times: there's only one thing I've never got
sick of, and that is why I am writing this. But she

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You mean Mangerton, I suppose?” I said at
once, for I had seen a sort of disgusted wonder in her
grave eyes at Mangerton's bow. I knew her as well
as she me.


“The secretary person? No, not him particularly.
That awful Jew next me at the ghastly high-tea--oh,
yes, you call it dinner. And that surly wretch on
my other side: but he had a nice voice when he used
it. Don't any of you ever <i>wash?</i>”


“Cohen? You're wrong for once, Pen: got you
first time. That man is a saint on earth. He never
has a penny, though he's got a decent income. He
gives it all away to the poor Jews who come from the
docks and don't know where to go: how can they
sing the songs of Zion here? I mean that, Pen: he
quoted it to me in the Hebrew, and he looked like
Isaiah and Abraham and Ezra all in one as he rolled
the words. And you should hear him groaning
all night through the Black Fast. His bedroom's
next mine. He's a strict Jew, and there's nothing
better on earth when it's real. The only luxury that
man has is going to concerts: his voice trembles when
he talks of music, and it's like the sea when he declaims
the Hebrew Scriptures--better than the English, you
know, but only just better--and it's like a kind,

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I'm sorry, John,” said Penelope, gently. “I
didn't realise he was your friend, and you know him
so well.”


“All right,” I said, ashamed of my heat. “As for
Bingham”--the other neighbour--“he's the most
brilliant man there. He forgets his own motto.
That's all.”


“He's a Wykehamist. I knew by the voice.”


“He'll be a great Labour leader one of these days.”


(As a matter of fact, both these prophecies, even
then hardly far-fetched, came true: they are not put
in here as anticipations after the event. Cohen did
become a Rabbi, and after his death a few years ago a
rest-house for poor Jews was founded in his name.
Bingham had most of his inside shot to pieces in the
War, throughout which he served voluntarily as a
private, flatly refusing to take a commission, and <i>is</i>
now a Labour leader.)


“All right, Johnny. They were bad shots of
mine. I'm sorry. I daresay you can defend just as
well those awful women with teeth and glasses.
There was one good-looking one, decently dressed,
but she looked hard as well as conceited.” I made a
grimace: I knew the types as well as the individual.
“But it isn't the people. It's the whole thing--the
dirt, the heat, the--the <i>smell</i>. If you're really keen,
you can do just as well outside, and help with more

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177168-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought I understood. “I expect you're right,
Pen. What do you say I <i>should</i> do?”


She gave a little sound of relief. “Come out and
be alive,” she said cheerfully. “Come and find
somewhere to live Chelsea way, and be near all of us.”


“All of us . . .” So I had come to that. It was
a long way from Dulwich and Miss Salway's school.
I felt suddenly as if I had at last grown up, and was
living in the reign of King Edward for the first time.


About three months later--at Christmas--I left
Spettisbury House; not for good, as will be seen
hereafter. Perhaps it might even be said I left it for
evil. I wonder what would have happened if I had
stayed on. I <i>might</i>--I just might--have found my
soul in the service of others: of that I had a more
definite chance to come a year or two before War
broke out, though when, in 1906, I gave up residence
at Spettisbury I had no more idea of that than of the
War. I refused it deliberately, and, for once, not
blindly nor wholly of my own will; for three years
after I quitted the East End I became engaged to
Penelope Bradford-Peverell, and was deep in another
whirlpool of changing customs and fluid hopes.
