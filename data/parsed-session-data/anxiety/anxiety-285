I was desperate. I started off miserable but was now scared as well. It
was clear that I needed to find a decent specialist.


I'd recently seen my old family doctor while visiting my parents,
and had mentioned that I was taking antidepressants. He'd immediately
scribbled the contact details of a colleague on a piece of paper, saying
she was great, and if I felt I needed any more help, she was the person
to contact.


After scrabbling around in the shoebox of receipts, letters and bank
statements on my desk, I found her number. I don't know how long
I sat on the stairs staring at it, too nervous to call. I wasn't frightened
of her but of the fact that maybe she couldn't help me. An increasingly
large part of me believed that this was it, this was my life and it
wasn't going to get better. The problem was me.


I didn't want that part of me to be proved right, so forced myself
to make the call to my third psychiatrist in two months.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was around 6.30 pm, and she was still at work. I introduced
myself, and explained what the problem was. Initially, I was embarrassed
but gradually, as she asked about how I felt, about what I had
done, and about my family, I felt more comfortable. She was listening
and taking me seriously.


And then she threw me into a complete spin, saying, ‘It sounds
like it would be beneficial for you to have a brief stint in hospital.’ My
doctor had mentioned this possibility before but I'd dismissed the idea.
I didn't want to. I didn't need to. I was not sick.


The psychiatrist phrased it as though it would just be a break,
some ‘time out’. She also thought I needed to be properly assessed
and it was obvious I wasn't coping. ‘Can you hold on for an hour or so
while I make a few calls?’ she asked.


I said yes, but wasn't convinced she'd ring back.


She did. At 7.30 pm she called to confirm that a bed would
be available the following day at N_, a private psychiatric clinic.
The word ‘clinic’ rather than hospital didn't make it any more
appealing.


I scribbled down the address and listened as she gave me directions
for the next morning. In the meantime, I was told not to make
any decisions bigger than what to wear or what to eat for dinner.
Most importantly, I wasn't to harm myself.


She suggested that I ask a friend to keep me company for the
evening, and then go to bed early. I just needed to get through the next
twelve hours.


I promised her I'd look after myself, then put down the phone,
relieved but shaking. What little knowledge I had of mental hospitals
came from films like <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> and <i>Frances</i>. I had
visions of people shuffling around in their pyjamas, drugged into
tranquillity. I thought of bars on windows, linoleum floors and the

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I didn't call anyone. I had never intended to. It was too hard to
deal with other people, particularly those I knew. On the one hand
I didn't want to spread my miserable feelings; on the other, I couldn't
disguise them anymore. I felt like a leper and it was better just to stay
out of the way. I did go to bed early though, my mind whirling as
I stared at the buttercup walls. In a moment of enthusiasm when I'd
first moved in, I'd painted them. It felt like they were ridiculing me in
their cheerfulness. But finally something was going to happen. It was
all about to be taken out of my hands.


I fell asleep exhausted.


Rodney was home when I woke up the next morning. I was going to
have to say something about going away. I could kill two birds with one
stone: he had a car so I could get a lift and I could also tell him a bit
about what was going on in my head, not the thoughts of self-harm of
course, but the depression. I could stop pretending that things were
okay. Pretending was not only exhausting, it was also making me dislike
Rodney intensely. Somehow I felt that it was his fault I couldn't be
honest. No-one talks about self-harm, so no-one talks about self-harm.
It's still a taboo subject—and no wonder. I certainly didn't want to
burden anyone with what was happening in my head. It was too graphic,
too frightening. It wasn't fair to talk about it.


While he understood the idea of depression, Rodney seemed
surprised that I should need to go to hospital. I looked fine. Nevertheless,
he was happy to drive me there. He wasn't happy to come in:
we weren't friends after all, just flatmates. Rodney left me and my small
suitcase on the footpath outside a large grey building with dark tinted

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Initially, I couldn't even find the reception area. The café on the
ground floor was closed and there seemed to be nowhere else to ask
for directions. The place was deserted and all I wanted to do was sit
down and cry. It wasn't fair; this was too hard. Going to hospital was
supposed to make me feel better, not worse. I was there though. I'd
made the effort and I wasn't going to let a small thing like not being
able to find the entrance put me off. Besides, I wasn't up to going home.
And then I saw the lift. It had been in front of me the entire time, along
with a few chairs, pot plants, several unmarked doors and a sign listing
the floors and wards. I got in and pressed the button for Level 3, reception,
my hand shaking. It wasn't too late to change my mind.


But I didn't.


Level 3 was carpeted and painted in what the decorators must have
thought were soothing shades of apricot. I went through two heavy
doors, both of which had glass panels at face height. (I learnt later
that these doors could be locked electronically from reception.) At the
end of the corridor I could see several nurses in uniform and various
other people milling about. I headed in that direction. Like a movie in
slow motion, it seemed to take forever to reach them. I felt sick,
weak and pathetic. What kept going over and over in my mind was
that I was physically well and that this was a hospital. I had no need to
be there.


The clinic normally didn't admit people on the weekends, which was
why the downstairs reception was closed. I was expected though. I bit
the inside of my cheek and followed a friendly nurse to a room with four
beds, each with its own chest of drawers, bedside table and curtain that

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was asked the usual health questions. Had I had any major operations?
Was I allergic to anything? Had I had any infectious diseases?
They asked for my medication. I was also asked if I'd brought in any
sharp implements. Why would I do that? I thought, I'm trying to get
away from those things. They know that. A psychiatrist who would
assess me more fully would be coming in later. In the meantime, I was
told to stay on the ward, either in my corner of the room—a space
of about one and a half by two metres—or in the common area.


Contrary to what I had imaged, the common area wasn't filled with
people dribbling and muttering to themselves. Instead, five or six
women sat on plastic-covered chairs and sofas. They watched television
in a rather half-hearted way, read old copies of women's magazines and
<i>Reader's Digests</i>, and talked quietly in a manner that suggested they didn't
want to disturb anyone else. Most of the women in this peach-coloured
room with its matching floral curtains were in their sixties. It was
strange to see them, dressed and looking perfectly well, sitting patiently
inside on a cloudless, sunny morning.


This wasn't what I had expected. My immediate reaction was, I'm
going to be really bored. It hadn't occurred to me to think about how
I'd fill my time once I signed in.


I was also trapped. I was now, of my own volition, locked up. I was
not to leave the ward, let alone the floor or the building. I wasn't allowed
to duck down to the shops. I couldn't go for a walk. This was particularly
galling as exercise was probably my only ‘appropriate’ way of
coping with stress. I'd never quite been able to get rid of the idea—
which first surfaced when I stopped eating as a teenager—that if you

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was strange being in a hospital where you could get out of bed—
indeed where you were expected to do so—but where you had
nowhere to go and nothing to do. On Monday, I was to find that there
was plenty to do. There were groups to attend on anger management,
medications, coping with depression, dealing with anxiety. But on the
weekend most people, if they could, would get overnight leave and
spend the time with their families, or at least arrange to go out for a
meal. For those who stayed behind, the two days dragged on endlessly.


What had I done? I still didn't believe I was sick. I was perfectly
healthy, just unhappy. What was I doing in this place full of sad, lonely
old women? How had this happened?


Late in the day, the consulting psychiatrist turned up. The doctor
who had arranged for me to be admitted wasn't taking on new patients,
nor was she a visiting specialist at this hospital. I couldn't imagine
how she'd got me in. Now this slight, well-dressed man in his fifties,
Dr G, was going to take over my treatment.


Dr G asked me to tell him about myself. As usual, I left out the
bits I didn't consider anyone else's business, such as my love life and
my mistrust of the medical profession. I was too embarrassed to talk
about sex or relationships, and only touched on drug use. I circled
around issues and expected him to read my mind, pick up on clues. He
scribbled down notes but didn't make any comments.


At the end of our session, he asked me to sign a contract: a list of
ten points, things that I would agree not to do during my ‘stay’. These
points included not harming myself, either with a blade or in any other
way. I wasn't to harm anyone else, nor was I to leave the ward without
permission. There were other requirements but they seemed unimportant.
It was a boilerplate contract, designed to cover a range of

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like an obedient child, I signed on the dotted line and promised
to behave myself. This was the beginning of a period of learned helplessness.
Suddenly, after a long struggle to maintain the appearance of
coping, I didn't have to look after myself. Someone would remind me
to take my medication. I would be given afternoon tea, morning tea
and supper, as well as cooked meals. Dinner was at 5.40 pm in the
dining room, so supper at 8 pm was a necessity. Breakfast was between
7.30 and 8 am. The only people allowed meals in bed were those too
unwell to get up. I wasn't considered one of them.


Over the next few weeks my days were filled with group therapy,
which I grew to hate. I really wasn't interested in the other patients. I
wanted my problem solved; I didn't care about theirs. I began to behave
like a fourteen-year-old, alternately giggling and sullen. The environment
seemed to encourage this behaviour.


I discovered that three of us in the Acute Ward had problems with
self-mutilation and were there for observation and our own protection.
What we had in common was gender, age and no confirmed
psychiatric diagnosis. Annabel, Jessica and I were simply unhappy. Self-harm,
or specifically self-mutilation, isn't classified as a disorder in
itself. It is seen as part of something else, such as depressive disorder,
an eating disorder, or some kind of personality disorder.

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The women I'd seen on that first Saturday weren't really representative
of those on the ward. They were just the ones who didn't have
anywhere to go. In Acute—where I'd been placed—people suffered
from a range of conditions, most with frightening names and very
specific treatment regimes. Some patients had severe clinical depression,
others were changing medication, and there were also those
who were waiting for medication to kick in. There were those with
bipolar disorder who were in the manic phase and had to be sedated
to curb their behaviour which could be extremely damaging. Some
believed they could fly, or were extremely promiscuous. Others had
delusions of enormous power. Given this mix of patients, the ward was
surprisingly quiet. I don't think this was just a result of the sound-absorbent
carpet.


The girls and women who suffered from eating disorders were on
the floor upstairs. There were no men up there. I watched them walk
into the dining room, accompanied by nurses who made sure they didn't
hide the food in their pockets or under the plates. After meals they
were made to lie down to let the food digest. Those who had been there
for some time looked healthy—not exactly plump, but no longer thin.
Others, newly arrived, did not look like young women. Their hair
was lank, their features gaunt and their posture stooped. One girl could
no longer walk and instead sat motionlessly in a wheelchair. Looking
at them, I knew I'd had a close call.


But then I'd chosen another fork in the road to self-destruction.


There were only two places you could meet people from the other
wards: the dining room and the recreation room downstairs. While
people didn't tend to socialise when eating, they did chat as they played
pool or smoked. Smoking was the norm; if people didn't when they

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was down there too, out of the way of the hospital staff, that you'd
hear other people's stories. Some were horrific and some, like mine,
were disturbingly mundane. There was a hierarchy of disorders, and
I'd regularly hear:


‘You're not really in danger, it's not like cutting your arm will kill
you, is it? None of those scars are real suicide attempts are they? You're
just playing. If you wanted to kill yourself you'd try some other way.’


We self-mutilators had no real tag but quickly began to want one.
We wanted a name for our problem, a clear-cut category and label.
That would give us an explanation and, no doubt, a quick drug-based
cure. We didn't want to hear that we had borderline personality disorder,
or any other personality disorders. These were too intangible
and, worse, there would be no quick solution with that diagnosis. But
it wasn't straightforward, and my treatment program highlighted this.


My new psychiatrist, Dr G, believed my urge to self-harm was
exacerbated by depression, so he ‘put’ me on Prozac, as the Prothiaden
clearly hadn't worked. An antidepressant was necessary if I wanted to
feel better, I was told. He also prescribed Stelazine, which I was to take
to calm me down if I felt that I needed to harm myself.


Psychotherapy wasn't, at that point, seen as a way to solve my problems.
The argument went that even if I delved back into my past and
found something monstrous, knowing about it, and discussing it, wasn't
necessarily going to stop the urge to self-harm. Dr G, having decided
that there wasn't anything obvious causing my problem, decided to focus
on the immediate issue: how to stop me cutting myself. The key seemed
to be in breaking the pattern. I had told him how it worked.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For days or weeks, I would resist the urge to hurt myself, and
then, for some reason, I would be unable to do so any longer. I'd walk
to the nearest chemist and buy a new packet of razor blades. I'd use
one and then throw the rest out, horrified by what I'd done. While
the wound healed I'd feel better. And then the cycle would start all over
again. Dr G's suggestions included calling someone before I went to
the chemist, or walking to the nearest café instead of buying blades.


It was apparent that he really had no idea how best to treat me.


At the end of the first week, my risk assessment was changed, and
I was allowed to go for walks. Administratively, this meant that I graduated
from a blue to a red dot on the large whiteboard diat was fixed
to the wall opposite the nurses' station. This board listed the first name
of every patient in Acute, their room number and their bed number. The
coloured sticker indicated how sick (or dangerous) the patient was. Blue
meant mat you were confined to the ward, orange mat you could leave
if escorted by a nurse or family member, and red was for those who
were allowed out for limited periods of time unaccompanied. It was,
in theory, a sensible system but in practice it had its problems—it was
easy to switch the stickers around when the nurses weren't looking.


With the notable exception of those who were manic, most of the
other patients were polite and quiet—an effect, I guess, of both their
illness and their medication. Occasionally mere were disturbances. One
male patient liked to sit in his tracksuit in the common room masturbating
while watching television. Many of us had reported this, but it
wasn't until he attacked a nurse that he was moved, we assumed, to a
more secure location. Jessica, who had signed a contract like mine,
broke it when she managed to create two sets of raw red scratch marks
on the inner side of both arms, using her fingernails which she'd carefully
filed. Within ten minutes of these marks being noticed, she was
assessed and scheduled. She was distraught.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

First the police turned up, motorbike helmets under their arms,
followed by ambulance officers carrying a stretcher. Technically, Jessica
was now under government ‘protection’ and proper procedures had
to be followed. This meant that she had to have a police escort. But
Jessica wasn't mad or dangerous. She was just miserable and expressing
it. It seemed to us that her behaviour had been seen by hospital authorities
as attention-seeking and she was being punished for it. I heard later
that she was spending her days curled up in the corner of a large
common room like a scared animal. It was a warning for those of us
who had signed the same agreements.


It didn't take more than a few days for the outside world to recede.
I didn't watch the news or listen to the radio or read any newspapers.
I didn't read at all, in fact. I couldn't concentrate enough to do so. I
gave up after the fourth attempt at the first chapter of a Jackie Collins
novel. I felt as though I were in a bubble. We could have been on Mars
for all that normal life mattered.


There were few visitors. Rodney didn't call, Alex didn't call. Only
Peter, one of the few people I was still in touch with from uni, dropped
in. When I rang him to let him know where I was he wasn't really
surprised. Instead, he sounded relieved. He knew that things had been
difficult for me, and had been doing his best to help. I didn't tell him
much about what was going on in my head but he guessed a lot of it,
and was as supportive as I'd let him be. This meant that sometimes
I would ring him at ten at night, frightened I'd use the fresh blade sitting
on my desk. He'd always come over when I called. Often I didn't ring
him though. I couldn't, or didn't want to.


Peter thought hospital sounded like an excellent place for me.


I still remember him walking into the common room; it must have
been on a Saturday afternoon because he was wearing tennis gear. He
sat down on the plastic-coated couch and started chatting to the person

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000089274-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother visited me once while I was in hospital. While she
brought flowers and a pair of new pyjamas as a peace offering, we had
little to say to each other. My admission to hospital was just another
example of how weak I was. Hadn't they taught me how to ‘rise above
it’? Hadn't they shown me how to hide and ignore my problems? My
mother believed that I was choosing to be like this. Choosing not to
cheer up, not to make an effort, and, finally, choosing to hurt myself.


When I arrived in hospital, I agreed with her view. By the time I left
a month later, I didn't. There had to be a reason this was happening to
me and I wanted to know what it was.
