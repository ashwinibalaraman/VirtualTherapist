<font size="4"><b>Stranger Anxiety</b></font>

Stranger anxiety--the emotional distress displayed by
infants and young children due to the approach of an
unfamiliar person--is a significant and adaptive developmental
achievement in the child's life. The presence of
stranger anxiety is rare in the first 6 months of life, common
by about 8 months, and peaks around the child's first
birthday. On average, girls display it slightly earlier than
boys. Research indicates that stranger anxiety is universal
cross-culturally among most infants and is signaled by a
host of infant behaviors, including crying, gaze aversion,
crawling or walking away from the stranger, hiding their
faces, and self-soothing (e.g., sucking their thumb). The
presence of such behaviors in response to strangers indicates
that infants are capable of distinguishing between
familiar and unfamiliar adults, a critical cognitive task.


Considerable individual variation exists among
infants, with some infants exhibiting more stranger
anxiety than others. Two factors have been linked to
individual differences in stranger anxiety: temperament
and attachment. Researchers have found that
infants who are temperamentally "fussy" are more
likely to respond more negatively to the approach of a
stranger than temperamentally "easy-going" infants.
In addition, researchers have found that infants who
have been indexed as securely attached to their caregiver
are more sociable and less wary of strangers
than infants identified as insecurely attached. Infants
who are securely attached tend to have caregivers who
are sensitive and responsive to their infants' emotional
signals, while infants who are insecurely attached tend
to have caregivers who are either inconsistently sensitive
and responsive to their infants' emotional signals
or ignore their infants' signals altogether.


The incidence and severity of stranger anxiety are
influenced by a multitude of contextual factors. Infants
tend to display greater stranger anxiety (a) when the
caregiver is not present, (b) when the stranger is either
tall, unattractive, male, approaches quickly, or touches
the infant, (c) when the infant is physically restrained
(e.g., in a high chair), and (d) when the infant is in a
familiar setting such as the home. The latter finding is
explained by considering that infants seem to expect
novel stimuli such as strangers in unfamiliar settings.
When a stranger enters a familiar setting, it violates the
infant's expectations. Taken as a whole, the above findings
suggest that not only is stranger anxiety a function
of the infant, but of how the infant perceives his or her
relationship with the outside world.


Caregivers often wonder how the incidence and
severity of stranger anxiety can be reduced. Infants tend
to display fewer negative emotional displays if the
stranger slowly approaches them and does not tower
over them; if the stranger approaches them in the context
of playing with them (e.g., peek-a-boo); if the
stranger behaves contingently with infants' behaviors
(e.g., smiling when the infant smiles); if infants are
allowed time to familiarize themselves with a novel environment;
if infants are allowed to crawl or walk away
from the stranger rather than being restrained in a high-chair
or similar apparatus; and if the caregiver is present.


In sum, stranger anxiety is an adaptive response
that is a normal and healthy behavioral reaction. The
incidence of stranger anxiety is influenced by several
factors, including the context in which infants find
themselves as well as how strangers approach them.
These factors and others can be modified to modulate
infant wariness toward strangers.
