BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So how are things going?
<b>PT:</b> They're going.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> One day at a time.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I had a migraine this morning, but the doctor gave me something I take -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That isn't a narcotic, you know, it's just what -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And it worked.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.  Do you remember what you're taking?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I take 2 at the onset and then 1 every hour.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Is this the first time you tried it?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I was real nauseous last night, woke up feeling like I needed to upchuck, and so I took the antinausea medicine -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it can cause headaches -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I read on there, so I'm figuring that's what it was, but I'm just relieved that it went away.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  How often are you getting migraines?
<b>PT:</b> Um, this is the first one since a week after my brother died, so he died the first week in March, March, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so it's been about 5, 6 weeks.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  And how are your spirits holding up?  You doing okay, or do you still feel pretty sad, blue, or -
<b>PT:</b> It comes and goes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's, a lot of it is the same shit that I was dealing with before.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I get, I have my moments.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sleeping.
<b>DR:</b> Sleeping well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How much sleep are you getting a night?
<b>PT:</b> Eight hours.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  And then do you feel rested in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  And then is your energy level okay during the day, or do you feel tired?
<b>PT:</b> I feel tired and I'm discouraged because I'm gaining weight.
<b>DR:</b> How much are you weighing?
<b>PT:</b> I weigh 140 and a year ago I weighed 125.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I weigh 140, I'm sorry, is that what I said?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And now I weigh 125, so I go to try on my clothes and -
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> I get discouraged.
<b>DR:</b> Is your appetite increased where it used to be, or are you eating different kinds of food, do you think?
<b>PT:</b> I'm not exercising as much.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I still haven't got to that point yet -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> To where I, I try to stay busy so I don't think about stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I haven't heard from my dad at all and I, that's, after spending 10 years taking care of him, I miss him -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, he's mean.  He's just mean.  I can't put myself up to that.
<b>DR:</b> I understand.
<b>PT:</b> So I worry still.  He's my dad.
<b>DR:</b> Where is he now?
<b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I get a call every once in a while from his caregivers, the hospital because I'm his power of attorney, medical power of attorney.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I just let them know, I give him there phone, his phone number and if there's any problems, call me back, but other than that, he's able to take care of himself.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> His transportation is provided for him through his, but, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I just struggle with that every night.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It's the worst.  But, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] just got back from camp.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, which camp did she go to?
<b>PT:</b> She went to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, did she have a good time?
<b>PT:</b> Yes and -
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> Boy was I, I was a mess Monday night.
<b>DR:</b> Nervous about her going?
<b>PT:</b> Just being gone, you know, the only time I've been apart from her for any length of time is when I was in the hospital, so -
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> She spends the night at her girlfriends' houses and stuff, but -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I got over it.  So, it was, it was good for both of us.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I knew that at the time too, but -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it is a hard thing, for a lot of parents, it's the first time their kids are gone that long.
<b>PT:</b> Mine were, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But then -
<b>PT:</b> Other than the hospital -
<b>DR:</b> And usually the kids do great, it's the parents that have the hard time -
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> The kids are having so much fun.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, they keep them so busy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She got a little sad one night, but she was so tired she went right to sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, good.  So she had a good time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Have you been feeling anxious at other time much, [PATIENT NAME], or not too much?  Yeah?  About anything in particular or just things in general?
<b>PT:</b> Things in general.  It doesn't matter if my mind gets going on me.
<b>DR:</b> So you start worrying a lot?  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> About nothing.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> My husband is wonderful.  He tries to distract me from those thoughts, you know, and I know I can't think about two things at one time.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I try to go with the positive, but it just doesn't always work.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, [NAME OTHER] is going to counseling today, as a matter of fact, at 4:00 because she's been, we've been dealing with bullies at school.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, no.
<b>PT:</b> And it just breaks my heart.
<b>DR:</b> Who is she, who is she going to see for counseling?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, [NAME OTHER], I think is her name.  She works, she's an intern.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, where is she?
<b>PT:</b> Right across from the feed store.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, good.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, when [NAME OTHER] shared with one of my clients, as a matter of fact, she didn't want to give me anything else to worry about -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, fortunately, [NAME OTHER] is just wonderful.  She called and asked if I minded if she took care of this problem and helped me with it and so we talked to [DEIDENTIFIED] and they, we'll have an appointment with [NAME OTHER] today at -
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I know [NAME OTHER], it's only the beginning.  You know, I, I'm [AGE], and I still deal with bullies, more or less.  You've got to accept the fact that people aren't going to like you, and they're mean.  And she just needs to get some strategies before 6th grade.
<b>DR:</b> Right, that's a good idea.
<b>PT:</b> And, uh, being the only child, you know -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I got teased since I was little by my brothers and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So, but she's oversensitive I think.  We had a bad experience in 1st grade and -
<b>DR:</b> With another kid bullying?
<b>PT:</b> A teacher.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> That's why we moved her up to [DEIDENTIFIED] instead of [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> And she's -
<b>DR:</b> She's knocking.
<b>PT:</b> She's covered.
<b>DR:</b> She's okay.  I locked this door [INAUDIBLE].  [NAME OTHER] is everything okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, just a second.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> I guess she wasn't knocking.  I thought she was.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, I'm just relieved that we're going to get, because this has been going on for years.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay.  Well, that's good to see.
<b>PT:</b> Same kid.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I go to the school.  I've gone to the counselor, you know, they say, "Well, we're not going to tolerate it," and then the kid is good.  He only does it to her when nobody's watching.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, kids can just be cruel sometimes.
<b>PT:</b> And she's sensitive.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm relieved to know that she's going to see somebody and it's not going to, because financially now we're, we're hurting.
<b>DR:</b> Sure, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER]'s not allowed to have any overtime.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?
<b>PT:</b> So it's just 40 hours a week.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> But [DEIDENTIFIED] has helped because there was a point there where I couldn't even open my envelopes from the memorial and stuff.  I was just, I couldn't focus.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And then we sat down and went through them all, and I, I, I feel better about what I owe.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you're getting it worked out at least.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  That's -
<b>PT:</b> They've been great over there.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Okay.  So a lot of stress, but you're dealing with it pretty well, it sounds like, [PATIENT NAME].  Um -
<b>PT:</b> One day at a time.
<b>DR:</b> One day at a time.
<b>PT:</b> One hour at a time.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes that's what it takes, yes.  Are you getting some enjoyment out of the things you're doing during the day, or do you feel like you're just kind of going through the motions?
<b>PT:</b> Definitely going through the motions.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I forget what it was like to be really satisfied or feel good about the stuff I get done during the day.  I don't have, I just go through the motions.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Are you having any suicidal thoughts?  Okay, good.
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING], no, I think about it because of what my brother went through, what he must have been thinking -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> All those months.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well then, I don't remember, was he getting any help for his depression or -
<b>PT:</b> He was on medicine, but, uh, he didn't see anybody.  He had been unemployed for a year.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That didn't help.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Well, you know, it's so hard these days because there is so much depression going around and people don't get help.  It's just awful.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I can't image where I'd be, [LAUGHING].  I wouldn't be here.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, a lot of people wouldn't, but the good news is there is help for depression.  You don't have to struggle.
<b>PT:</b> And I keep telling myself that.  That this has got to get better.
<b>DR:</b> It will.  It will, and also, I mean, you're setting a good example for [NAME OTHER], to know that in her life if there's trouble, she can get help with it.  She doesn't have to suffer, so -
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.  And I have both [NAME OTHER] and her to live for -
<b>DR:</b> That's right, that's right.
<b>PT:</b> I have a really good support group with my clients.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Everybody worries about me.  They call me out of the blue and, just to make sure.  I had a CT scan -
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> For my stomach.  I was so nauseous and they did that.
<b>DR:</b> Did it check out okay?
<b>PT:</b> No, I've got, we'll I've got the arthritis in my back -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And more kidney stones.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> They're little, but they're there, so that explains my pain because I wake up every morning with a back ache and then periodically through the day, and that's the way kidney stones in the past have felt.  I get it in my back.  You don't realize it's your kidneys, but this is the third time I've had them.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I try and drink a lot of water, but I just, it's genetic.  My father had them.  I have brothers that have had them.
<b>DR:</b> Well, okay.
<b>PT:</b> It compares to having a baby.
<b>DR:</b> That's what I hear.  I hear it's not fun.
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But at least I understand know why I'm so sore.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> My back anyway.
<b>DR:</b> And who is your family doctor?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's right.
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Yes, did he have any recommendations on what to do about the arthritis or anything?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, just, uh, well, for one, hang loose with the, you know, until the kidney stones move.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I have to get an upper GI.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That's still pending.  I still have to get that scheduled, but I, they should be out today with my CStat, my night machine.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, CPAP?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and they're hoping that that will help with my headaches because sometimes if my head hurts I'll just put the oxygen on and it helps.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you've got a lot going on right now, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> I do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I just, I just expect myself to, you know, I don't, just another day, another, what next.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the good thing is you're dealing with it.  You're taking care of yourself and that's, that's important.
<b>PT:</b> I try.
<b>DR:</b> What about the medication, Lexapro?  Any problems with it at all?
<b>PT:</b> Not that I know of.  I, I know it must be helping some but I still just get that icky feeling in my stomach all the time.
<b>DR:</b> Like a nauseous feeling?
<b>PT:</b> No, just worrisome stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, like anxiety?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's where I feel it, in my stomach, it's all queasy.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But not nauseous, just like right now, I'm just -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And the Seroquel, you're still using that at night?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And how many are you taking?
<b>PT:</b> Six.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now that could be contributing to weight gain, just to warn you.
<b>PT:</b> I know, we talked about that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and you know, you're not, it's not something you have to panic about or do anything about right away, but if your weight does keep going up, we might want to look at that because I've seen people, who if they didn't stop it, gain a lot of weight, so -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And there are alternatives we could look at.
<b>PT:</b> I think, I've maintained 140 though for a couple of weeks -
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.
<b>PT:</b> For a month or so.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  So, are you okay with leaving Seroquel the way it is for now?
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I'd say let's leave that, wait until another month and then re-evaluate.  If you're able to maintain, we don't have to worry about it.  If it starts creeping up on you again, we might want to -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  I appreciate that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, because sleep is so important, but we don't want to create another new problem, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Because that really would crush me.
<b>DR:</b> I understand, yeah, it can create other health problems too; some people even gain so much weight they develop diabetes and things like that.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> We don't want to mess with.  So, okay.  Um, any others?  Any other stresses?  You've got plenty that we've talked about, anything else going on?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> Just the fact that I'm not making as much money too.
<b>DR:</b> Business is down too?  Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And with me being sick, some of them wanted to give me a break.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But they're coming back slowly but surely.
<b>DR:</b> Well, good.  Yeah, just about everybody I talk to talks about, you know, slowing down their business.  It doesn't matter what business -
<b>PT:</b> It's awful.
<b>DR:</b> They're in.  It is, it's really putting a crimp in people's lives.
<b>PT:</b> People don't get their hair done every week anymore, they get it done once a month, you know, and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm fortunate to have the diversity, you know, it's not all old people and it's not young people.  I've got some that are on fixed incomes, but I'm part of their income.
<b>DR:</b> Good, so they can still afford to come see you?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Well, um, okay, [PATIENT NAME], is there anything else that I haven't asked you about that you want to talk about today?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What I'm thinking is, let's maybe leave the medicine the way it is for another month.  You know, hopefully, with each month things are going to get a little easier, you know, just in terms of you grieving over your brother's death and medically hopefully getting on the CPAP will help.  Hopefully with, not just with the headaches, but it can help with the energy, it can help with depression, you know -
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it can help with a lot of things, even weight because sometimes women, sometimes people eat when they're tired to get the energy -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And if you get better sleep with the CPAP, you're not so tired during the day.  You may find you're not eating as much.
<b>PT:</b> That's true.
<b>DR:</b> So sometimes it helps.
<b>PT:</b> Cool.
<b>DR:</b> So let's see how you're doing next month.
<b>PT:</b> That's encouraging.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and, um, like I said, if things are stable and improving, great, and if not, then we'll make some changes next time to -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Help you feel even better yet.  Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, good.  Um, anything else before we set another appointment?
<b>PT:</b> Nope, I think we're good.
<b>DR:</b> All right, well let's look for mid May then.  There's mid April.
<b>PT:</b> They'll be out of school in 5 weeks.
<b>DR:</b> I know, it's going fast, isn't it?  Let's see, today's [DATE], remind me, is there a day of the week that's best for you?
<b>PT:</b> Any day as long as I get [NAME OTHER] to school at 9:00.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So this gives me 10 minutes to get her there.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so like an 8:30 time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that's fine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, do you want to -
<b>PT:</b> That's good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want to do Thursday, [DATE] at 8:30?
<b>PT:</b> Sure, I can do that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I'll give you a card.
<b>PT:</b> Have you ever seen this, uh, there's a photo of [NAME OTHER]?
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> There's a portrait, and on the back it says forgiveness.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, huh.
<b>PT:</b> But that is -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Ideal, I mean, my brothers, both [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] look just like that.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> We thought my sister in law had it printed for him.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> But even down to the way his pants were worn.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It looks -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Just like him.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  I'll be darned.  Where did you find it?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the artist is here in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> But when my brother died six years ago, my sister in law and him went to a, uh, meeting, or a thing at their church -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And the artist was there and he explained all the different, how he created that and all the different, um, what each and every thing -
<b>DR:</b> Symbolizes?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> And 2 weeks later he died.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b> But he didn't, because [NAME OTHER] said, "Gee [NAME OTHER], that looks just like you," and he goes, "Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] were like, I mean they, it was hard to tell who was who.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> Until they turned around, you know, their mannerism and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well -
<b>PT:</b> But -
<b>DR:</b> That's a gift to have that then, isn't it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Cuts right to the chase.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  All right, [NAME OTHER], well again, if you need anything before next time, just give me a call, okay, but hopefully things will keep improving and getting better.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> All right?
<b>PT:</b> All right.  I'll give you that.
<b>DR:</b> All right, well, have good month, okay?
<b>PT:</b> I will.
<b>DR:</b> All right, it's good to see you.  Take care of ourself, all right?  Hang in there.  Hope you keep getting better.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> All done, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> All right, take it easy, [NAME OTHER], okay?
<b>PT:</b> She's not comfortable at all.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING], all right, I'll see you later.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Bye, bye.
<b>PT:</b> Say thanks.
<b>CG:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> You're welcome, bye, bye.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
