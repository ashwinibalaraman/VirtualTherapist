BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Come in.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: Hi, (inaudible - 0:00:02.0).
CLIENT: How are you?
THERAPIST: Good, how are you?
CLIENT: Good. It's so humid.
THERAPIST: I know, I thought it was me.
CLIENT: It can't be.
THERAPIST: Like.
CLIENT: It's disgusting.
THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible - 0:00:11.3) sweating, the train was (inaudible - 0:00:13.1).
CLIENT: I really hated it. No, I was just like (inaudible - 0:00:16.5) there's never any (inaudible - 0:00:18.2), like it's the driest  -
THERAPIST: Nice.
CLIENT: Fine net and so when I come back here I think it seems even more, you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: It's easier if I get some for some reason. But anyway …
THERAPIST: It should be fall soon enough I guess.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know, I mean I thought it was turning quickly like a few weeks ago, but then I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So they are cold images?
CLIENT: Not as cold as it gets here but anyway I have updates.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Updates and then I don't have anything to talk about. But so I told you whole situation and then what happened was, actually Thursday, so like right after we saw each other.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I was, I thought about everything and just like I mean I don't know there's an issue with my parents like I mean they do alright but they never really saved money and like got a house and everything so what I would really like to have assets but they don't have a lot of money in the bank and we got over this like. I don't know if you're familiar with the Chicago Housing Authority apartments, they would like be the really hard to come by like basically government apartments and if you qualify and you're on a list and you like basically like win the lottery you can get these apartments and there are certain ones that are coops, so you buy them. And you only, it cost like $28,000 something and you basically buy an apartment and you have to pay like maintenance fees but it's a very, very low cost. So anyway we qualified for this apartment, we're getting it, its $28,000 and this, but this complex is have, is going private like within the next year or so. So we're going to buy this apartment for $30,000 and be able to like flip it basically for whatever like market value is on the apartment.
THERAPIST: Wow.
CLIENT: Which is crazy because even though, I mean it's not the nicest building in the world or anything like that but it's a Chicago apartment.
THERAPIST: Where is it?
CLIENT: It's near LaSalle Street.
THERAPIST: Oh definitely.
CLIENT: Like, yeah I mean its fine.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's, you know (inaudible - 0:02:21.3).
CLIENT: Yeah, people have to like people work there.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Or whatever so. Anyway, so the story was that my parents are paying for it because my sister and I have no money so whatever. And it's basically like all of their, the rest of their money that they have saved. So it's not a big deal I mean like they do alright, so like they're okay with what they have and whatever, but the point is that they're not going to be able to pay for me nor sponsor me for a visa because you have to prove that you've a certain amount of money in the bank and blah, blah, blah.
THERAPIST: Put it on current assets or any biggies.
CLIENT: No, it's money it's in the bank. So they aren't going to be able to do that even if I want to study which is basically the only way I can go back. So I don't know like I'm really, really, really irrational sometimes and I really I over react about like stupid things a lot. But in some situations like I don't know I can pull it together and not be that upset like I was just kind of like well this is the situation, you know what I'm going to do. So anyway I told my boyfriend and I was basically, at the same time I looked up programs in Chicago for him to study like English, whatever, because I didn't really know how to put it to him but it's something we talked about before we even got together so it was something he was interested in before we started dating. So I told him the situation, I told him what I found and he basically like agreed instantly and thought it was like a really good idea. And so now we're working on him coming to Chicago instead of me going there. So yeah so like that and like he has a really awful like family situation. His parents are really controlling - (0:03:58.9)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - or whatever and …
THERAPIST: He'll probably like to get out of that (inaudible - 0:04:04.4).
CLIENT: It's better for him and there's no disadvantage in this situation for him and for me like, you know I've been there (inaudible - 0:04:11.5) a year and a half like I mean I kind of needed to move on too in one way or another and it's not, it's not as easy when you're living in another country, you know?
THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.
CLIENT: Like to like I don't know move up in your career or whatever so I mean in other way, in some ways it's, in a lot of ways it's better for me too.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So that's the story, so it's good. So he's probably, he's coming in October regardless to look for an apartment and hopefully …
THERAPIST: Who's living in the apartment that you're buying?
CLIENT: No one yet because we were signing, we're closing tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Is that something that you and your sister are going to live in, I don't really understand what you're saying?
CLIENT: Well, it's under both … like I have an apartment in Northwest, it's also a Housing Authority apartment, I don't know how we struck gold in all these like lotteries.
THERAPIST: So you have two?
CLIENT: Yeah, we can't keep both.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because they're like government but still … well, actually, yeah, no we can't keep both. Actually the one uptown already went private, it's not a coop though it's only a rental so we don't own it.
THERAPIST: Oh okay so you're renting it.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. (0:05:10.4)
THERAPIST: But for like a lower fee  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - then it should be or something?
CLIENT: Like it's a really, it's a huge one bedroom, we pay like oh $1,000 a month or something.
THERAPIST: Wow, nice.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's huge. Anyway, so when I went to Lisbon, my sister moved in. I mean the apartment is only in my name and she's not on the lease but this apartment …
THERAPIST: Is your sister older or younger?
CLIENT: She is two years younger.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: This new apartment we're both on the lease. And this is another issue, I wrote down like all my things this week that I stressed over and we can talk about but that's another issue. But then there was something that happened yesterday that I think deserves the  -
THERAPIST: Attention.
CLIENT: - focus, yeah. So yeah the thing is like my sister has in this apartment and she has a boyfriend who she is super, super, super serious with and I would say she probably spends one night if that a week in that apartment.
THERAPIST: In the?
CLIENT: In the northwest apartment.
THERAPIST: The one that you live in together, right? (0:06:02.0)
CLIENT: Well, I live with my parents now.
THERAPIST: Okay. And she's living in the one that's in your name?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And it's fine because I was away and whatever so. But she's never there and I have two cats and like I adopted them and like the deal was when I went to Lisbon she got her own apartment which she was living with my parents and they were killing each other before so she got the apartment and she had to take care of the cats. So she's never there, the cats are like neglected which makes me, because I'm like the biggest animal lover so I'm going to go there after this now and I just play with the cats for hours. But anyway the thing is like she wants to move to this apartment downtown which I don't have a full time job right now so I'm not going to fight it because it's like it's not fair. I mean like I mean it would be a (inaudible - 0:06:50.5) for me to pay for it although I should be able to regardless because it's like $400 a month I mean, you know. And but like the thing is her boyfriend lives in Northwest, she works in Northwest, like this apartment is on in the financial district, like she's never even in the apartment on the Northwest so I highly doubt she's going to be in this one. (0:07:11.3)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And so I don't know, my sister is volatile and she's like very, she's just crazy. Like we could spend years talking about my sisters. And she just like, she starts fights, she doesn't know how to talk to people like properly and it starts fights and the whole family is like fights over it and just a huge issue.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So that was another, that was a fight. But I don't think it's … the thing is the thing that bothered me about that situation was that my, I got, I get angry really quickly in certain situations and I think like that needs to be addressed. Because like I think I told you last time, I'm not an angry person like I don't walk around like angry at the world all day but like I get, I don't know I have a bad temper or something I don't know for certain things that I don't think are worthy of that type of reaction. (0:08:02.7)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But anyway we can talk about yesterday it's stupid. So everyday I speak to my boyfriend, he calls me from Lisbon because his parents don't know that we're together, this is, I feel like, we don't have enough time to discuss all these issues, it's just so ludicrous and I don't care because I know, I know the way he is and I know the way he has described them and like, I know the way Portuguese people are and especially like they're super conservative like traditional Portuguese people and whatever it's not an issue. But because of that he has to call me like when they're not around so that and the other thing is he doesn't want them to know that he's coming here and I'm a big part of the reason because then they might just say like no you can't go and whatever.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:08:49.4) probably financially.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean at the very least they're going to say like we, we'll give him x amount of money for a year which they have to do for this (inaudible - 0:08:56.5) or whatever.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So yeah they have some kind of control administration so he's being careful which is fine, I don't really care. But anyway we talk everyday and so he told me the other night and he said I'll call you tomorrow meaning yesterday. And then he like, when it got to a certain hour and he hadn't called like I started to get like okay well maybe he was busy today. There are actually reasons why he wouldn't be able to whereas other guys like you might be (inaudible - 0:09:27.1).
THERAPIST: Yeah, (inaudible - 0:09:27.7) of the distance you don't know what things are.
CLIENT: Yeah so I was like alright you know I'll wait a little while or whatever sees what happens and he still didn't call. And it's just not like him, you know like at the very least like he would send a message or something just saying that he can't.
THERAPIST: Does he text sometimes?
CLIENT: Yeah, like I can't talk now but I'll try to call you later, I can't talk today I'll call you tomorrow and he didn't. So like 7 o'clock our time which is like 1 o'clock their time in the morning, I sent, I called him but it was like a missed call because they do that there I don't know why we don't do it but like they just call like it rings like twice and then the other person calls you back. It's just kind of like to say I'm trying to get in touch with you. (0:10:06.4)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I don't know why it's such a big deal.
THERAPIST: Do you (inaudible - 0:10:09.0) to call to him?
CLIENT: Yeah. And he didn't call me back and I was just like okay that's really weird because if at any time he should have texted or something to let me know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So then I knew something was like wrong or I thought something was wrong and I started freaking out and I was like I couldn't work, I was at my friend's store working, I don't know if I told you but like I'm helping her on her new store she has a fashion line she was going to store it like downtown so yeah I've been helping her or whatever. And I was working in her store and like for the last, I think for the last two hours that I was there I was like obsessing, obsessing, obsessing, obsessing, like I wrote down notes, I tried to like reason with myself, like I tried to do like the worksheet.
THERAPIST: Really?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you have it with you or?
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't think I did a very good job.
THERAPIST: Well, I can help you, you know to do it.
CLIENT: Yeah, the thing is also I did it, well I wrote it in my notebook but I used the worksheet. It didn't really help but I think maybe because I'm not use to or something, I don't know. (0:11:06.6)
THERAPIST: And also, you know we'll do it together a few times.
CLIENT: Yeah. I doodle so much it's ridiculous. Yeah, the thing is that it's weird, it's like I know in the moment that I'm being irrational, like I'm fully aware that it's like so ridiculous the things that I'm thinking, yet for some reason they like I can't think that.
THERAPIST: I think that's really common because people you can say is a logical you can say  -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - this doesn't make any sense, but I think in the end what helps a lot of people … well we can go through it together and we can dispute it together.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: You know the irrational beliefs.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then I think I have one argument that for me has always seemed to work.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Well, okay. So first of all, the first thing the activating thing which is that.
THERAPIST: So this is about the missed call? (0:12:00.4)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or lack of kind of.
CLIENT: Well, the lack of …
THERAPIST: And he still hasn't contacted.
CLIENT: And he hasn't.
THERAPIST: And he still hasn't contacted you?
CLIENT: No, no, well he had, he did contact me last night eventually 4 o'clock in the morning and I was just like he had a fight with his mom and had to leave the house and like met friends and whatever. I'm like the thing is I totally understand it and I wasn't angry like at that point I was just like okay understandable I kind of had a feeling it had to do with the family in someway.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But he was out with his friends, I mean he's not only party animal like crazy guy whatever so.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:12:34.3).
CLIENT: So it's not like yeah right and it's not like that but it just the point is like he did have the ability to call because he wasn't in the house and that kind of annoys, still annoys me. And I just think it's really inconsiderate because like, fine you said you were going to call and it's not the biggest deal in the world that you didn't earlier, but it's just like …
THERAPIST: Yeah, and then once you found out.
CLIENT: Yeah, you can just send a message, like I can't talk to you now I'll try to call you later. (0:13:01.6)
THERAPIST: So the next day, because you had already gotten in touch with him, he calls you at 4 in the morning our time?
CLIENT: Last night yeah.
THERAPIST: Our time, okay.
CLIENT: No his time, his time, his time.
THERAPIST: His time, wow he was out at 4 in the morning.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, they do that I mean it's really late I don't know why they eat dinner like at 11 o'clock, it's ridiculous you know.
THERAPIST: Okay. So he had called you.
CLIENT: Yeah, he calls.
THERAPIST: And now this is yesterday?
CLIENT: Yeah, yesterday.
THERAPIST: At the store that you were having your (inaudible - 0:13:26.3)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which one you want to work at, because I mean in the moment I can understand I mean we can work on those irrational thoughts too but I think what's bothering you is that like the next day it was still plaguing you.
CLIENT: Well, I think what bothers me the most is how, my reaction or my over reaction to like the fact that he didn't call like.
THERAPIST: So what were you … yesterday in the store, what was bothering you your over reaction?
CLIENT: No the fact that he hadn't called.
THERAPIST: Okay, so the same issue?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: That same thing but then like the things that I was thinking for example these are like the things that were going through my head. Although I wrote this down I said like most likely it has something to do with his family why he's not calling. The things I was thinking were like he doesn't want to come Chicago any more and he doesn't want to tell me. He doesn't want to be with me any more and he doesn't want to tell me. Maybe, this is like really scary because I was walking home and thought this, maybe something happened like he got into an accident and he's like in the hospital and like no one knows to contact me because they don't we're together and like I can't even go there and like yeah. Like other the things that are just ridiculous, like just ridiculous, like there's no basis for those thoughts.
THERAPIST: But those I mean to me I see two issues.
CLIENT: Uh-hmm.
THERAPIST: And I think that we're going to definitely work on the one right now that's your concern but I don't know if we have time today, it sounds like there is also a lot of concern that you even have these thoughts. You're kind of beating yourself up.
CLIENT: Yeah and I do that too. So after, that's the other problem once I have these thoughts that I have beaten myself up and I'm like crazy part of myself. (0:15:07.0)
THERAPIST: We'll call like a secondary emotion you know.
CLIENT: And I also beat myself up over doing the missed call because then I was like why would you even bother, clearly he can't call so now you just sent him this call and look like a stalker or look like a crazy person and then I beat myself up over that for like hours.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So it's a lot …
THERAPIST: So which one do you want to work on?
CLIENT: Maybe we should take it out of a hat or something.
THERAPIST: Well, which one do you think is upsetting you the most?
CLIENT: Well, I guess right now my reaction to him not calling.
THERAPIST: Okay. The … what emotion would you say, you know the fact that because even the next day  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - he did call. So was that, it wasn't that he didn't call it was that he didn't call when he was suppose to  -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - when it was convenient for you guys to talk?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And when you had made an agreement to talk?
CLIENT: Yeah, more or less yeah.
THERAPIST: And I think the thing that seems to bother you the most is that not only did he not call when you agreed to call but as soon as he was able to call he still didn't call. (0:16:08.0)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: So it's not that he didn't call it's that he, he didn't call at soon as his convenience.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: In your opinion obviously.
CLIENT: Yeah, I just think it's inconsiderate, it's not the worst thing in the world if you do …
THERAPIST: Well that's, that's not the activating event, the inconsiderate because that's your  -
CLIENT: Right, that's how I see it.
THERAPIST: - (inaudible - 0:16:28.3) of the event.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So that would be event. So it's also important when you're doing this kind of thing to make it specific because it's not that he didn't call, it's that he didn't call as soon as can …
CLIENT: Right, he didn't call.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Okay. And what do you think the emotion that you were feeling was? It's hard to pin it down.
CLIENT: It's not depression, it's not depression, I think it's more like an anxiety.
THERAPIST: Okay. (0:17:00.4)
CLIENT: I think that's old anxiety.
THERAPIST: Was it anxiety or was it anger?
CLIENT: Anxiety.
THERAPIST: Anxiety.
CLIENT: For sure.
THERAPIST: So it was, what were the thoughts that were going on? You were saying before what if he has changed his mind?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's almost like I'll tell you the more specifics but almost like if you could put like a line of like here are the like least bad things that could possibly happen that were and you like went down the line and then here really is the absolute worst, it's like anything that's in that category like I was thinking.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Like the dumbest things like he's not coming to Chicago any more he doesn't want to tell me. His parents won't let him come to Chicago any more and he doesn't want to tell me. He doesn't want to be with me any more and he's too scared to tell me, which is crazy even just because he's like the most straight forward honest person he never has hesitated to tell me anything.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Even when it's like not the most positive.
THERAPIST: Well, I'm going to tell you a little psychology education as we call it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: It sounds so terrible it's like I'm educating you.
CLIENT: No I like it. (0:18:01.2)
THERAPIST: The difference sometimes that you consider between CBT (inaudible - 0:18:09.7) and REBT, it's kind of what you were doing with yourself was the CBT like. There's really no evidence to back up these statements.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: REBT, I'm not just going to stop with that thought I'm going to pursue that thought further so what do you think was the strongest thing that you were trying to, that created the most anxiety? That he doesn't want to be with you any more?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That was the one.
CLIENT: Because in some way.
THERAPIST: You think it was.
CLIENT: Other things are related.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: He's not coming to Chicago any more, well, why well, he's, he doesn't want to come to Chicago.
THERAPIST: He doesn't love me enough to make this choice?
CLIENT: The parents not letting him is more of like that's out of my control, you know but I don't know.
THERAPIST: Or you could say no because some people I mean some people give up you know their financial ties.
CLIENT: Yeah. So yeah.
THERAPIST: The thought that he doesn't love me enough to  -
CLIENT: Yeah, probably.
THERAPIST: - to like to stand up for us and stuff?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Is that the biggest?
CLIENT: Probably yes.
THERAPIST: Or is that he doesn't love me at all?
CLIENT: I don't know. Yeah, probably just at all.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: He doesn't care or love or like he doesn't care enough about this …
THERAPIST: To make it.
CLIENT: Yeah to make it work at all.
THERAPIST: Because you know in some way that there was love before. Are you confident about that?
CLIENT: Well, we're not really at the stage where love has been expressed.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But strong feelings for sure.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So it's mostly he doesn't care about me enough.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or he doesn't care about me any more.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is that the thought?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Now I know if he doesn't care about you any more then what? So he doesn't care about you any more.
CLIENT: I mean nothing like. (0:20:00.7)
THERAPIST: Nothing, is the (inaudible - 0:20:01.7)?
CLIENT: Well, I would feel bad, I mean I would feel I would be really sad.
THERAPIST: You feel sad. Or are you saying, because you said, I understand that's a healthy emotion when something happens, you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What you care about. Are you saying maybe sad or are you saying that would be awful?
CLIENT: Yeah, it would be awful, it really would be, it would be awful.
THERAPIST: Are you saying, if he didn't love me any more or didn't care about me any more that would be like catastrophically, if he didn't love me any more then I would have wasted all that time span, I can't believe I spent all this time thinking about him and all the money and all like does it get out of control like that?
CLIENT: I don't know, the thing is like right now I, I say no because I don't, I'm not in that situation, like I can't and my because I can be rational like I'm just like well it's not the end of the world like yeah it would suck, it would suck, but you know I have this here, I have that  -
THERAPIST: Oh no.
CLIENT: - this.
THERAPIST: But we've already established that you're probably saying  -
CLIENT: Like if I were …
THERAPIST: - it's awful, because I have  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - I have a pretty strong feeling you're saying it's awful. (0:21:01.2)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Often with anxiety there's the catastrophic thinking  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - that goes along with it.
CLIENT: Okay. If I were in that situation, if that were to happen I probably, yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Is there any of it I couldn't stand it if he didn't love me? Like it would be just unbearable?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean let's put it this way, the fact that he wasn't calling me was unbearable and I couldn't stand it so I'm sure if something happened where we weren't together anymore, yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Crazy.
CLIENT: It would be that same unbearable like I can't stand this.
THERAPIST: And then I think there's even a fourth rationale, I think you have a lot of irrational thoughts on the list.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There would be like  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - that it goes down to because you can't just stop with a thought it's what does that thought mean to you? You know if that was true would you say, you know (inaudible - 0:21:44.0) kind of say let's suppose it's true.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Because we all get to be irrational (inaudible - 0:21:48.1).
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So I think there is also another thought that because you mentioned before that you kind of (inaudible - 0:21:54.3) down yourself  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - frequently. So there is also that thought if he doesn't care at me it's because I'm not worth it, I mean I … (0:22:01.4)
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's …
THERAPIST: I'm a terrible person.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Worthless.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah which is weird because I don't feel like I think that, but I think that that's just the bottom line, like once you get down to it.
THERAPIST: Well, I think sometimes it takes an event for that feeling to come up you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That might not be how you walk around all day, but it could be how you've learned to cope in these difficult situations.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Sort of go to.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I failed the test because I'm worthless.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I … she broke up with me because I'm worthless.
CLIENT: Right, no I think it's true.
THERAPIST: So which one do you think is the strongest? Is the one that's causing the most anxiety?
CLIENT: Of those things we listed?
THERAPIST: Yes, I mean they could be all and we can work on them all  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but it sounds like that would be awful is pretty bad, the I couldn't stand it is pretty bad, and the self doubting is pretty bad.
CLIENT: I think yeah, I think the not be able to stand it is like it's so weird for me to talk about it when I'm not in the situation because it just seems to ridiculous but it's so awful at the time. (0:23:06.1)
THERAPIST: That you couldn't stand it if you couldn't …
CLIENT: But I can't like function like I'm just obsessing so much that  -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - it's like that, you know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And also the self like …
THERAPIST: The self doubting that I'm worthless.
CLIENT: Yeah, the self doubt, I'm worthless, like I guess that yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So which would you like to work on first?
CLIENT: Maybe the I can't stand it.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well, you're here.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So empirically you stood it.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know.
THERAPIST: Right? Could you stand if he didn't love you or if he didn't care about you as much as you assumed he did?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I know I could, I know I'm not going to die because of it, it has happened to me before and I've been able to stand it, but it's just in that moment it's so awful and like …
THERAPIST: Are you saying something else because are you saying something like he must love me, he got, he has got to make his decision, does that come up at all? Like it has to work out. (0:24:09.6)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It has to work out …
CLIENT: I think I do that a lot like it has to work out it has to be the way that I want it to be.
THERAPIST: So those are demands as well  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - that you're putting on.
CLIENT: Like, for example, this whole situation with him coming here even like in my head. It's okay to be positive I think, it's good  -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - like especially when you have positive whatever. But to just have the view point this has to work out like with no other like options, like you're sitting yourself up for like a real, like a big disappointment, you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And it's funny because you have a lot of the disputing you know, but you're right you're still saying you know I'm disputing this  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but it still doesn't feel inside.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So that's what I'm going to try to give you the tools  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - to try to change that, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's going to take time and practice.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's the hard thing you know it's not going to be overnight. But you know does it make, like it doesn't make sense you said that if he didn't care about you any more that you couldn't stand it because you know you could stand it. (0:25:08.9)
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You stood that like thinking all night that he didn't, you know that he probably didn't love you, that's what we were thinking all night.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Okay. And so we said it doesn't make sense empirically.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Does it logically make sense though that like just because he doesn't call, he doesn't love you?
CLIENT: No, no.
THERAPIST: There are a million things. And have you ever had a situation where you maybe had like a really terrible night where you were like I just can't, I don't want to talk because you know if you talk to that to that person you really have to talk about the issue and you kind of don't want to talk about the issue, has that ever happened before?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: No, you want to talk to that person immediately?
CLIENT: Not only, it's not just that but I am always thinking about the other person and how they would feel so I always say to myself I don't want to talk to them but they're going to feel bad if I don't call, like if I just don't, you know what I mean, like because I would feel bad. (0:26:02.9)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I don't do that.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I know that about myself.
THERAPIST: Well, what would you tell like a girlfriend of yours though if this had happened to her? Say you're right on (inaudible - 0:26:11.5).
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Maybe he doesn't love you any more.
CLIENT: I would say the same things that my friends tell me like stop being (inaudible - 0:26:16.6), like you're being, over reacting.
THERAPIST: So it doesn't make sense.
CLIENT: No, it's for sure doesn't make sense.
THERAPIST: But lastly I think the most important one, because these are ones you're not buying.
CLIENT: No, it's not that it's that  -
THERAPIST: In the moment.
CLIENT: - I think those things while this is happening and it doesn't help me and I know them you know.
THERAPIST: But I think it's because you don't believe them. You're saying all of this is true but I know better.
CLIENT: Right (inaudible - 0:26:37.6), maybe.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Yeah, probably.
THERAPIST: So what, the last one is always what we call the functional dispute. How is this helping you? Is this going to help your relationship?
CLIENT: No, it doesn't help anything or any one around me  -
THERAPIST: Is it going to make you more …
CLIENT: (inaudible - 0:26:52.9).
THERAPIST: Is it going to make him want to be with you more?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: This crazy behavior?
CLIENT: No, it does not.
THERAPIST: No. Is it going to make people you want to be around yourself? It seems like you just want to escape yourself? (0:27:04.6)
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: In these situations. So what can you think differently? Did you come up with any alternative rationale beliefs that you could think instead? That is the key.
CLIENT: Yeah (inaudible - 0:27:19.1).
THERAPIST: Now that I have just identified that these are wrong but to come up with another one. So what is something you can say about stand in?
CLIENT: I don't know. That …
THERAPIST: I'm saying he should have called me, if he loved me he would have called me, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I know, you know if, I know that he has busy things but if he doesn't call every time I expect him to I can stand it and it doesn't mean that his feelings have changed for me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? (0:28:01.7)
CLIENT: Yeah, but I don't know, I don't know how like maybe it's true that I just I know these things but I don't believe them  -
THERAPIST: You've got to say it.
CLIENT: - I don't know how.
THERAPIST: So say it, say it in a way. I want to hear you say it like you, say it a few times like you believe it. First practice, find one that works for you.
CLIENT: So, I don't know. Although  -
THERAPIST: It's like.
CLIENT: - I don't know. That's true I just don't see it.
THERAPIST: Okay, I'm sorry (inaudible - 0:28:31.9).
CLIENT: (inaudible - 0:28:32.4), it's a really weird name.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:28:34.6), okay. So if (inaudible - 0:28:36.6) doesn't call when he say he does because this probably could happen again, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. And it will I'm sure.
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:28:42.2) doesn't call when he said he would that doesn't, you know, I can stand it. You have to say I can stand it and it doesn't mean his feelings have changed for me, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So.
CLIENT: Alright. If he  -
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:28:59.9).
CLIENT: If (inaudible - 0:29:00.5) doesn't call me when he says he's going to I can stand it and it doesn't mean his feelings have changed. (0:29:08.6)
THERAPIST: I don't really buy that.
CLIENT: Well, what if it does mean his feelings have changed?
THERAPIST: Well, I think that's when we work on the worthless. Do you want to work on that part?
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Well, say that a few times.
CLIENT: Okay. If he doesn't call, if (inaudible - 0:29:20.3) doesn't call me  -
THERAPIST: Because he doesn't really … well, I'm saying that do you think the call means his feelings have changed?
CLIENT: The call or not call, no.
THERAPIST: No, you know what I mean?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Even if his feelings have changed he's still going to call you a few more times, don't you think?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: He's not going to just stop calling.
CLIENT: No I know it's true.
THERAPIST: He's feelings are going to change over time.
CLIENT: It's true. If (inaudible - 0:29:38.2) doesn't call me when he says he's going to I can stand it, I forgot the rest.
THERAPIST: And it doesn't mean that his feelings …
CLIENT: And it doesn't mean that his feelings have changed, it's obvious.
THERAPIST: Right? His feelings …
CLIENT: The call doesn't …
THERAPIST: His feelings are going to change for a long time he's not going to change in one day, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So the call is not the determinant of the feelings. And I think in a long distance relationships, you know we take these little things to be the - (0:30:04.2)
CLIENT: That's another thing.
THERAPIST: - entire measure of love and affection.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's still just a little thing, in love.
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: It means a like because you get so little.
CLIENT: Right, but it's still not.
THERAPIST: You know, is the call a measure of love to you?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: It isn't right now, no.
CLIENT: No it's not it's really not.
THERAPIST: Are you sure?
CLIENT: Yeah, I am, it's not.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And yeah, it's not at all.
THERAPIST: So maybe you can say that to yourself.
CLIENT: The thing is I wouldn't have mind if we didn't speak everyday. I wouldn't have mind if  -
THERAPIST: It's just when to say.
CLIENT: - it's like but if you say you're going to call, you're not some random guy I meet at a bar where I'm like is he going to call and I don't care whatever, I don't know. Like don't like just be considerate and send a text message but it's out of my control.
THERAPIST: People always have to act the way we want them to?
CLIENT: Yeah, I think that's another problem I have. I know it's not, it's out of my control.
THERAPIST: Every time you say should, you know people should do that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Why, why should he call when he says he's going to call? (0:31:05.6)
CLIENT: Because it's the right thing to do.
THERAPIST: Why is it the right thing to do?
CLIENT: Because that's what I think.
THERAPIST: Is what you think always right?
CLIENT: No, but how is it not right? How like …
THERAPIST: Well, it doesn't not necessarily always considerate but does the person you love have to be considerate?
CLIENT: No, I mean you would like them to be but.
THERAPIST: Just because you like them to be it doesn't mean they have to be.
CLIENT: Don't have to be. I mean there is something …
THERAPIST: And he is most of the time.
CLIENT: Yeah, he's always considerate, I mean I just I don't, it's not something that happens often, you know I mean.
THERAPIST: But it could still happen more often?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Could you stand it? I mean that would be something that you know if that started happening often and all you have is a long distance relationship you might say it's not worth it, maybe you know?
CLIENT: Right. No, it's true. (0:32:02.5)
THERAPIST: But here's another thing you know, if (inaudible - 0:32:06.5) did in fact not love you any more, let's go with that one, would that mean that you're worthless?
CLIENT: No, it wouldn't.
THERAPIST: Are you sure?
CLIENT: It wouldn't but and like once I'm removed from these situations because obviously like I said I would do for (inaudible - 0:32:34.2) boyfriends and I love them and then we broke up and it felt like it was the end of the world and like once I'm removed from the situation like after time passes, it's like well obviously …
THERAPIST: So you've survived a breakup with somebody that you have been involved with before? And (inaudible - 0:32:49.1) you don't even, you haven't used the L word yet.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Do you know if you love him?
CLIENT: I'm confident about it yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. But have you been more confident about other relationships in the past? Has the love been even stronger or at the time? (0:33:03.7)
CLIENT: Yeah at the time yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So you've survived breakups.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Did you lose some worth along the way?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: So empirically you don't seem to lose worth  -
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: - when that relationship comes to an end, right?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And is it logical to think, you know, someone, if a relationship ends it's because I'm a terrible person?
CLIENT: No, but it's like when I say it that way I know like even in the situation when I'm crazy and obsessing and anxiety ridden, I know it's, I can answer it like that. But it's like I don't know, I don't know what it is, it's just like I won't, I'll be able to answer that fine but then I'll do things like if I hadn't done this maybe it would different. Like if I hadn't gotten deported from Lisbon, maybe this wouldn't be this situation which I think those are problems too because it just, it's like beating myself up, beating myself up. And in some ways it's at the bottom line it's well because I don't think I'm, you know I'm not worth (inaudible - 0:34:16.7).
THERAPIST: Do you have to be perfect to have worth?
CLIENT: I think yeah. Well, I know the answer is no but I think  -
THERAPIST: For you though?
CLIENT: - I put that pressure on myself.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And when I don't do something, like for example on Sunday night with him, this is another crazy thought I was thinking, we had the fight over the apartment, my family, we're driving home, we had brunch with my sister's boyfriend and his family. And it was my sister, her boyfriend, me and my parents in the car, we had a fight over this apartment and I was really like, because I got angry I was like annoyed about it whatever after. And I spoke to him and he kept interrupting me, speaking over me because like, you know like the conversation is delayed and whatever because of the distance and I got like snippy with him because I was just like and it wasn't even that bad but I just said something like hey I'm going to wait for you to finish and then I'll talk or something like really snippy. And he liked, he like knew immediately that I was (inaudible - 0:35:17.6) and he was like annoyed about it and because of that I thought like maybe he's not calling because of that. You know like there's another irrational thing but the point is I was still beating myself up over that little tiny incident where the one time I ever said something to him that was like, you know in a negative tone.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And it's like I'm still beating myself up over it whereas other people probably would just forget about it.
THERAPIST: And so is your worth determined by what other people think about you?
CLIENT: Yeah, also, yeah.
THERAPIST: I noticed in your forms that you filled out, they were actually very helpful for me.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean there was a lot of what I would I did not guess came up for social anxiety. (0:36:00.5)
CLIENT: Yeah, also.
THERAPIST: Which made you think that that's a problem for you?
CLIENT: Yeah, but in weird ways. Like I don't have problems, like I love meeting people, I love social events, but in certain social like events, I get very socially like anxious.
THERAPIST: And it doesn't prevent you from doing it but you're still uncomfortable?
CLIENT: Yeah, like I've reached the point, it used to prevent me from doing things, I reached the point where I don't let it stop me, really, certain things yeah but most things no, but I'm still uncomfortable.
THERAPIST: But it's because of how other people are judging you?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And the worst is if your boyfriend is judging you?
CLIENT: Right. The closer the people are.
THERAPIST: But how does a judgment of some person affect your worth?
CLIENT: It doesn't.
THERAPIST: Do all people have worth?
CLIENT: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yes.
THERAPIST: But do you really think that?
CLIENT: I think they do, I think everyone has worth.
THERAPIST: Every human being? (0:37:00.6)
CLIENT: Maybe not really shitty people, I don't know. I mean  -
THERAPIST: I don't know about that.
CLIENT: - like a serial killer or something like that.
THERAPIST: You know some people argue that they do, you know that  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - just the fact that you're human and alive.
CLIENT: The thing is I like to think that. Just the fact that you're human and alive like gives you worth like maybe I personally don't like your behavior, I don't like, you know maybe you're not a good person, like you're a murder or something but, but separate from those things like you have worth as a human. I think animals have worth, I mean for god sake like, you know …
THERAPIST: Even in the animals?
CLIENT: Yeah. More then (inaudible - 0:37:43.7).
THERAPIST: Even the dogs that fight, yeah.
CLIENT: Actually, which is kind of crazy but yeah.
THERAPIST: Exactly.
CLIENT: So
THERAPIST: So I am still not clear how someone else's judgment can affect your worth.
CLIENT: It doesn't but it's … it doesn't and I know it doesn't but I still, I never thought, I'm not a perfectionist in like every sense of the word, but I still strive to be perfect and for some reason if I'm not it's like it's like awful. (0:38:15.0)
THERAPIST: And how is that working for you?
CLIENT: It's not actually at all, it's really not but.
THERAPIST: So is there anyway that maybe you can lower, it doesn't mean lower your goals if that's how you want to be but you demand yourself to be, it's not that you want to be it seems like you demand it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And when you don't meet that expectation, when you make a mistake in a relationship or you say something hurtful or you don't act in the way that you wish you would act all the time  -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but you demand yourself to act perfect all the time and then as soon as you don't you're worthless.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Being perfect is kind of hard to do.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's really hard. (0:39:02.5)
THERAPIST: Why should you be perfect, who made you this special?
CLIENT: It's just that I just feel like I know so well like, number one I should be able to control my anger in situation, certain situations.
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Number two … I don't know because it's stupid and it's unnecessary.
THERAPIST: Why, that still doesn't explain to me why you should be able to do that. I understand that you would like to -
CLIENT: Because I feel that  -
THERAPIST: - be able to.
CLIENT: - yeah but it's like I know that it's not necessary and I know that's stupid and I know it's an over reaction.
THERAPIST: Well, this is something that we can get into next week, the secondary emotion because I think that's causing you a lot of distress after the fact and I have a lot of issues with you thinking that.
CLIENT: Yeah, I have a lot of issues with my thinking too so.
THERAPIST: I think you are a little hard on yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I have to say the fact that you already … even doing your homework and the fact that you're able to, you know you have a lot more cognitive awareness then a lot of other people, you know you're able to think about your thoughts and to go over them and often I think people who have that it creates anxiety. (0:40:03.6)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: People with very low cognitive function generally don't get the same kind of anxiety and depression and like they're angry  -
CLIENT: Oh really?
THERAPIST: - because they aren't able to think about it  -
CLIENT: It makes sense, yeah.
THERAPIST: - and they can (inaudible - 0:40:15.1) with that all the time.
CLIENT: I wish I had that.
THERAPIST: Well, no because you're not lashing out as much as you might be wishing you were lashing out.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then you're beating yourself up over having the thoughts that you want to lash out.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. My thinking needs to be …
THERAPIST: So I would say …
CLIENT: (inaudible - 0:40:34.0) or something.
THERAPIST: I mean we're going to work on the perfectionism but I want you to think about that some more like you know why you're holding yourself to these other standards and do you really need to be better then everybody else?
CLIENT: Yeah, I know.
THERAPIST: And I think thinking those things is not helping you to achieve who you want to be.
CLIENT: Right, it's true. It's for sure true.
THERAPIST: But also the fact that your boyfriend I think just understanding that, you know a phone call from him does not determine his feelings for you. (0:41:06.8)
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you can stand it, even if his feeling had changed you could stand it, you know that.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But let's assume that they haven't, you can stand it if he's not, if he's not living up to the expectations that you set for him.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: What a boyfriend should be?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can stand it right? Would you date him, would you still want to be with him and let him move to America if you knew sometimes he could be a little inconsistent?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean.
THERAPIST: Then you can stand it then you know what I mean?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Because if you couldn't then maybe it's not worth him coming.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You're probably a little inconsistent sometimes.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. And maybe I don't know if it's true but maybe like, I don't know if I hold other people to the same standards that I hold myself but maybe that's another like that's one of the things like my expectations are so high like the same way I shouldn't beat myself up over once snippy comment or whatever like I shouldn't beat him up over not calling - (0:42:10.1)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - just the time he said he, you know like it's, but I think it's another, so many things related but it's like when I don't get what I want, it sounds really bad because I'm not bratty like that, maybe I am. But like it's like I can't stand it, you know?
THERAPIST: But you can.
CLIENT: I know I can. But it feels like …
THERAPIST: (inaudible - 0:42:31.7). But every time, okay here's the thing, every time you say I can't stand it your body it goes into the physiological reactions. You're going to get madder, you're going to get anxious, your heart is going to start racing, you're going to start sweating, your fingers or your muscles are going to tense. It's going to then make you act more the way that you don't want to act.
CLIENT: Right, right.
THERAPIST: The anxiety or the anger. So telling yourself that is not working.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Even if you don't believe it you need to practice telling yourself. Say it until you believe it and every time those thoughts come up, and they're going to come up over and over again, oh he didn't call you this is so annoying like I can't stand it when people don't call me when they say they're going to call, you know what I mean? You need to replace it with a new rational statement. (0:43:14.1)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: The old ones aren't going to go away, you have to replace them.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And it's going to take practice. And they may never go away, right?
CLIENT: No, I know.
THERAPIST: They may never go away but as long as you can replace them with something else.
CLIENT: And like then deal with it properly.
THERAPIST: And think about and you know calm yourself down with these statements. It's okay we're pretty much done.
CLIENT: Are we? Yeah so.
THERAPIST: You know you've got to practice.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Practice the statements.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that is what's going to help.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay? And you can keep doing that, you know it's good, maybe, do you want another one? (0:44:02.3)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can make a photocopy of it, make a photocopy of it and use it as much as you want you know?
CLIENT: Yeah. Did you have a chance to think about the books?
THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: It called A Guide for Rational Living.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And it's downstairs. A Guide for Rational Living. And I think it's by Ellis. But you can ask for help, it's like one of the main like.
CLIENT: A Guide for Rational Living.
THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Do you want to write it down?
CLIENT: No, that's okay.
THERAPIST: You've got it, okay.
CLIENT: I'll remember yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So it should be downstairs. And that I think kind of has the general rules of RUT and if you like that they're ones that are more for anger and more for anxiety.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: But that one kind of covers the four ranges of emotions.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: And it's kind of a good introduction.
CLIENT: Alright good.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I like I don't know why but I like books.
THERAPIST: I'm glad that you like books.
CLIENT: I don't know why I like books but I didn't mean it that way but I like for these types of things I don't know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's helpful isn't it?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's a reminder at home. (0:45:00.0)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Some people I don't know because you seem like really dedicated to the process, some people like to tape their own sessions  -
CLIENT: Oh really.
THERAPIST: - and then you can listen to it later, if it's something that you forgot or take notes on things like (inaudible - 0:45:11.7) or something like that.
CLIENT: Yeah maybe, maybe.
THERAPIST: You can listen to the session later.
CLIENT: I think it would be helpful for me to write things down, I think.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I don't know if I would want to listen to myself.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: Because I sound like (inaudible - 0:45:22.4).
THERAPIST: But you know it might be, but you know it might be good to eventually listen and to be able to say oh catch what you're saying when you're saying it.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's good for me as a therapist to listen because I'm like oh I really missed the boat there.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It provides you with what you don't want to hear.
CLIENT: Maybe. I'll start with, maybe I'll start with writing.
THERAPIST: Uh-hmm.
CLIENT: And then if I feel like I don't remember some things maybe I'll listen.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So, are we finished or?
THERAPIST: Yeah, we're finished.
CLIENT: Okay. No I didn't, I don't even know what time it is.
THERAPIST: I'll say it's 10:20.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So, oh the other thing I wanted to ask you is if it's possible to change the time? (0:46:02.4)
THERAPIST: Okay. Are you free, I don't have any later morning because I have a 10:30 that I see after this. Do you have time on Thursday evenings?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You do?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. I think right now I have one Thursday and I think it's at 6, would you like 5 o'clock or a 4 o'clock? No, because you don't have a job right now, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, no.
THERAPIST: But you know you may get one so.
CLIENT: Well, yeah. Maybe 5 o'clock.
THERAPIST: 5 o'clock.
CLIENT: If that is alright?
THERAPIST: Thursdays?
CLIENT: Yeah, should I tell them downstairs too or?
THERAPIST: I can tell them.
CLIENT: But not for this Thursday, for the following?
THERAPIST: Yeah. (inaudible - 0:46:41.5).
CLIENT: Okay. Tomorrow is Thursday anyway.
