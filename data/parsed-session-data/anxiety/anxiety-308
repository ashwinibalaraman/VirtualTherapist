"JUST along from Stratford," declared the rosy-cheeked
gentleman as he heaved himself into one of
our deepest armchairs in the lounge after ordering double
whiskies for himself and his two companions. "Well,
what do you think of our fellow citizen now?"


"Shakespeare?" I queried.


"No, Chamberlain," answered the rosy-cheeked one.


Whether the rosy-cheeked gentleman had merely
referred to Stratford as a stopping place upon his road or
whether Stratford-upon-Avon had for the time being
adopted Chamberlain in priority to its momentarily less
famous native son, I never came to know. I did my best
to be non-committal about Chamberlain—though it was
difficult for me to be non-committal about Chamberlain.


"Your place quiet today," said the rosy-cheeked
gentleman changing the subject.


"Yes," I said. "Yes. We're quite busy sometimes."


However, I perforce must agree with his remarks. In
the six weeks since the Oxford by-election a lull had
settled over "The Marlborough Arms"—a stillness broken
only at intervals by the habitual sounds of breaking
crockery from the kitchen.


Yes, my God, it had been quiet. In my support of
Lindsay at the Oxford by-election I had been conscious of
throwing discretion to the winds. Obviously, in one's
endeavours to build up a licensed establishment with a
first class connection, it was not the best thing in the

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Don't mix politics with your business."


The words spoken at our inaugural luncheon party
eighteen months previously echoed through my brain in
somewhat tardy warning. There was no doubt that,
however non-commital I endeavoured to be inside the
hotel, my "dangerous" political reputation had spread
abroad.


"What's the matter with your fire?" said the rosy-cheeked
gentleman.


Admittedly the fire was smoking dismally. But the
rosy-cheeked gentleman seemed to shiver more violently
than could be accounted for merely by climatic conditions.


I could almost hear the talk about me in the pubs in
Oxford and up and down the road between Oxford and
Birmingham:


"This doctor fellow at ‘The Marlborough Arms’" it
would go: "Was it true he was a Red and a Warmonger?
Well, he's been mixed up with that man, Lindsay, and a
pack of Communists. It didn't matter, of course. He
seemed a nice enough chap. But with these Reds, you
never knew. Besides what was a doctor doing keeping a
hotel, anyway......?"


Me a Red! And a Warmonger!


Indeed; as I apologized to the rosy-cheeked gentleman
about the fire, I seemed to appease him rather less
sucessfully than his hero, Chamberlain, had appeased
Hitler.


"This is Proprietary whisky you've been serving us
with, I hope?" he queried.


He and his friends appeared only partly satisfied with
my reassurance on this point too. They finished their
glasses and, refusing the half-hearted suggestion of
"Another one," they rose ponderously and walked
out.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Under any other circumstances it would have been a
relief to see them go. But at the present juncture I was
left disconsolate. Yes, the place had certainly been quiet
over the recent weeks. Quite a number of familiar faces
had been missing since the Oxford by-election—good
customers from whose absence the till had suffered.
Their place had been taken in rather unsatisfying fashion
by stray groups of Popular Fronters and Left Wingers,
eager to patronize one of apparently similar political
persuasion. While the Left Wingers were good talkative
company, one had unfortunately to admit that,
from a financial point of view, they were worth next to
nothing as the connection of a licensed establishment.


I was alone in the lounge. I was alone in the hotel.
Anxiously I sank myself down into one of the large arm
chairs away from the smoking fireplace.


An eternity of quiet seemed to have settled on "The
Marlborough Arms." For barman George had gone. And
the locals had gone too. I missed George and his cheery
greeting; and I missed his "sixpenny mild" customers
too—they had been pleasant hearty types who had
cheered things up. However Chris had been right. They
had filled the place with noise but without bringing in
sufficient money even to pay the expenses—poor devils,
they did not have the money to spend! Meanwhile barman
George had become increasingly proprietorial—standing
in the front of the hotel in his shirt sleeves as if he owned
the place. But his results had not paid out. An evening of
pandemonium in the bar in which George as the presiding
genius had served some 100 pints of mild beer, would
yield but £2.10.0 at the end of it, the profit on which was a
fleabite towards paying the expenses of our newly-decorated
hotel. Nor was this all. The "sixpenny milds"
had not only impinged on the hotel with their noise, but
had spread themselves in other ways too. Half way
through the preceding winter they had made the happy

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Something had had to be done. It had gone too far.


The procession across the lounge had been effectively
stopped by the expedient of putting a penny-in-the-slot
lock on the inside lavatory together with a large notice
"There is a free gentlemen's lavatory down the yard."


This quite reasonable action had, however, been
regarded as a declaration of war.


"A penny for a pee" went up the agonized yell from
the "sixpenny milds"—some of them quite young men
hardly incapable of walking down the yard.


When George took the side of his friends in the
matter, the economics of the situation were brought
home to him by a gentle but firm insistence on his taking
on extra duties—such as washing the floor of the bar.
This had led to George's resignation from his job as a
question of principle.


"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown." All my
life that I had been a subordinate to someone or other,
I had sought after power and responsibility. But now
that I had them I began to realize they had their disadvantages.
I had to face up to the stark fact that a hotel
keeper, if he is to pay his expenses, must restrict his
acquaintance to those with good spending propensities.
He could not afford favourites—not impecunious
favourites anyway. The locals were good fellows, but
could we afford them in the main part of the hotel? The
logical answer to this had been to construct yet another

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was, as I have said, no open hostility. On my
side I could afford no show of resentment. While my
local friends on theirs would willingly return to play in
my team when I fixed a darts match accompanied by
offertories of free bread and cheese refreshments to both
teams for the occasion. Just as they would willingly
troop back the following night to "The Bear" when
Ted Smedley threw in pickled onions with his refreshments
in addition to bread and cheese. But, as expenditure
on bread and cheese represented already a substantial
part of the profit on the hotel's total takings on such
occasions, this was an auction that could not go on
indefinitely.


I reflected on these and such like matters as I sat in the
lounge of "The Marlborough Arms." We had had the
place straight and shipshape for a year now with our
nicely furnished dining room, but we were still not
drawing the crowds. We had had rows with the locals and
brushed off the bookmakers and the charabanc parties.
We had acquired an A.A. and an R.A.C, sign. But our
greatest enemy remained the implacable conservatism of

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

However, just now the compensating thought came to
me that perhaps, after all, it was as well that we had no
customers, as at this minute we had no staff either.
We were wallowing in the aftermath of one of our periodic
staff crises. The waitress and the chambermaid had had
a row with Chris some ten days previously and had given
notice, just at the same time as old Nellie, who had
helped us through the summer as cook, had been unable
to sustain herself on Guinness any longer. It was Jim, the
barman's day off, the newly engaged cook had not
arrived and I was left alone in the hotel with only Richard,
the kitchen porter, watching the lunch while Chris and
Joan Face, who had recently arrived to assist us, were
out in Oxford in the car foraging for supplies.


Staff troubles, as I have already inferred, had begun
within a month of taking over the hotel, and had continued
almost unceasingly. As I look back over those
commencing years at "The Marlborough Arms," my
mind's eye is dazzled by the kaleidoscopic succession of
cooks, kitchen porters, waitresses, barmen and other
helpmeets in our venture who came and went, had to be
engaged in succession to each other, fed, paid, humoured,
given days off at the proper time and (most difficult of all)
kept working in mutual harmony. Of the many bugbears
of the hotelier, staff troubles are undoubtedly the most
serious. The perpetual threat of "Notice" and the subsequent
difficulty of replacement hung like a Sword of

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We had had troubles with cooks, troubles with kitchen
porters, troubles with barmen, troubles with waitresses.


In the matter of cooks the choice lay between the sober,
reasonably clean, but highly temperamental variety
such as Miss T———, well-spoken, intelligent and Etoncropped
and the Guinness-drinking, unhygienic types
such as our old Nellie, fat and foul-mouthed with filthy
habits, who stayed with us an entire summer until such
time as her feet swelled to such an extent that even she,
old Trojan as she was, could no longer walk on them.
We had other cooks besides these two, but they broadly
fell into one category or the other. I regret to put it on
paper at this time of intensive campaigning for cleaner
food, but Nellie's cooking tasted the best!


Our long succession of kitchen porters—ranging in
intelligence and accomplishments from the "Immortal
Victor," our poet who evidently found the same relief
from mental strain as I did in washing and drying dishes,
to his successor who appeared with, as his only piece of
luggage, three volumes of <i>The Children's Encyclopedia</i>
tied up with string—comprised probably the most
unusual collection of human beings that one would find
anywhere.


Of our barmen I have already said something. However,
this <i>genus</i> reached its apotheosis in George's successor,
Paddy. Paddy was jockey-sized with a thin, wizened
humorous-looking face, and bore the surname of a well-known
jockey whose relative he claimed to be together
with consequent prestige gained thereby. At our preliminary
interview, Irish and plausible, he testified to

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was only when I made one of my too infrequent
inspections down the cellar that I found out the price of
Paddy's social success. The price to me, that was. Alas for
Harry Gowing's "fine wines"! The overstocks of excellent
sherry and vintage port that had been my problem ever
since taking over were my problem no longer. They had
vanished in a manner unaccounted for by the amount of
bar takings. My detective sense led me to the bottle shed
and there were the empties, methodically stacked to the
extent of some forty bottles of sherry and thirty bottles of
port. Whether their contents were drunk by Paddy or
whether he sold them off to pals on the quiet I do not
know. It would seem impossible for one so small to have
drunk so much in so short a time; but one never knows.
Certainly confidence no longer existed between Paddy
and myself and he departed next morning.


Hotel waitresses are, as I have invariably found,
charming, hard-working, honest and loyal, but somewhat
erratic people. So erratic, in fact, that I had at this present
juncture decided to solve the waitress problem according
to the principles of <i>noblesse oblige</i> by advertising for lady
waitresses.


In fact, as I sat contemplating this nadir of my hotel-keeping
activities, my reveries were interrupted by a
glimpse through the window of a large Alfa Romeo, as it
passed down the courtyard, bearing the most recent
recruits to our staff—the twin goddesses, Pam and Jean,

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked out into the courtyard to meet them.


"We're here," said Pam with smiling welcome.


"I say, what a nice old place!" said Jean.


"When do we start?" said Pam.


"What do we do?" said Jean eagerly.


"I expect my wife will show you that when she gets
back."


"When does she get back?" said Jean.


"Oh, quite soon." I said. "What about a drink until
she comes?"


"Do you think we ought to?" said Pam. "Surely we're
staff, aren't we?"


"Not just yet," I said. "Not until you've had a drink."


"What about the customers?" said Jean.


"We haven't any customers" I assured her. For the
first time since I had taken "The Marlborough Arms" I
felt quite pleased we had no customers.


I had been anxious as to whether Chris would approve
my choice of' lady waitresses. However, it was not long
before she was back and it was not without relief that I
noticed the pleasant way in which she greeted these
rivals in charm. But that was Chris's "line" and, indeed,
it was quite an effective one.


Pam and Jean, dressed in the flowered accoutrement of
the lady waitress, stayed with us some two months
satisfying the eye as well as the stomachs of our dining
room customers (even if sometimes they left a void
where the heart should be) during which time I for one
could not decide which of these two divinities I
worshipped most. Only the slight habitual askewness of
the knives and forks when laid, the occasional presence
of an unremoved cobweb, bespoke the mortal origins of
these ethereal beings. Certainly they livened up our

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So much for staff, but before passing on I must surely
pay tribute to those who, for small reward and with many
pains, succoured Chris and me in our travail with the
various problems to which I have referred. If there is a
more harrowing life than that of manager or managing-proprietor
of a small hotel, it is surely that of assistant
manager—a life of being chivvied about from above and
of having to fill in the deficiencies created by every
variety of human fraility from below. In our inability to
afford professional managerial help, we had to rely on
those heroic characters, "well-educated young man who
will take anything," "lady of good social position willing to
give any form of service"—those irregulars of the hotel
world, without whom the country hostelry up and down
the length and breadth of the land would fail to function.


Our well-educated young man had come and gone,
worn down after having his handle-bar moustache ground
between the upper and the nether millstone, and our
assistant at the time of which I write was our friend, Joan
Face, who had joined us in September, charged with all
the energy of nuclear fission resulting from stresses of
a stormy married life. It was perhaps Joan's misfortune
that she will be remembered in the bar of "The Marlborough
Arms" by the unfortunate coincidence of her
surname with the fact that life's trials had caused a
troublesome skin eruption on her face which took months
to heal. Despite this, however, and other troubles too, she
helped us through the winter until the Face family
became re-integrated for the period of their tenure of
"The Jolly Sailor," Saltford.


My readers will perhaps have formed the conclusion
that the time covered by this chapter was one of

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Such a conclusion, however, justified as it might be,
would be an erroneous one. For here, to drive away dull
care is my elephantine friend, Bill Green, harbinger of the
new era in British agriculture, all ready to turn on a
celebration on the strength of selling no less than twelve
milking machines in one day—in the course of which he
eventually became uproarious on our best Tio Pepe
sherry, insisting on my accompanying him glass by glass.
Or maybe there is a party of my anatomy students come
out from Oxford to patronize my beer. Or perhaps it is
Saturday and I look forward to the weekly call of actor
Basil Radford—the same genial person in real life as he
is on stage and screen—on his way to his week-end
cottage at Blockley.


Thus, in looking back on this time, it seems less one of
trouble and worry, than it does one of varied activity and
sociability amongst friendly people. The peculiar fascination,
of the hotel business—the continual thrill of seeing
and talking to fresh people, of impressing one's personality,
of being in the limelight, started to grip me.
The show must go on! I felt myself caught up in the nonstop,
real-life drama of the hotel business that does not
run for three months, six months or even a year, but
throughout the centuries with only such changes of caste
as human changibility and frailty from time to time
decree. So here I was, the <i>premier</i> of my act as a doctor-hotelkeeper;
and in those days before the diaspora of the
medical profession had started under the aegis of Mr.
Aneurin Bevan, a doctor-hotelkeeper was still something
of a novelty—a phenomenon to be cultivated for its
unusualness. This fact gave me a prestige that went some
way to compensate for my political deviations.


Superficially, at any rate, I became integrated as a
doctor-hotelkeeper—as handy at pouring out a bottle of

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite my difficulties I was beginning to assimilate
myself to my new surroundings, my new way of life, to
make friends and to enjoy taking part in local activities.


What of local activities?


"What do they do in Woodstock?" asked the enquiring
stranger, oblivious of history and mystified at the <i>raison
d'être</i> of this small town on which he had as often as not
in those days alighted by chance.


"Drink beer and play darts," was the acknowledged
reply to such a query.


Since that time, darts has maybe tended to fall out in
Woodstock in favour of other pastimes. In the meantime,
however, all personal worries could be submerged in
drinking beer and playing darts. In upholding "The
Marlborough Arms" darts team against such formidable
antagonists as "The Hopcroft's Holt," "The Lord
Nelson" or "The Fox" at Leafield.


Then, in the intervals between drinking beer and
playing darts was the excitement of the first successful
Woodstock pageant, held in the beautiful setting of the
garden of Blenheim Palace at which, amongst other
more faithfully portrayed events, one witnessed the
pitiable spectacle of Alfred the Great swallowing his long

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In this way I drank and played my way through the
winter of 1939. One had to drink while playing darts; one
had to drink to be polite; giving way to friendly persuasion,
one continued to drink against one's better judgment
until after midnight, night after night, as one
visiting guest after the other wished to celebrate, regardless
of the fact that some other guest, long in bed, wanted
to be seen off early in the morning. One had to continue
to drink at the whim of every lonely stranger—to drink
manfully and to the detriment of one's health, not helped
by the dishonest ruse of the "innkeeper's gin bottle"
filled with water—which I was too squeamish to adopt.
And this continual drinking was doing me no good.

As the year 1939 drew on, more promising hopes than
beer and darts informed me in my alternative manifestation
as a political candidate. As the international situation
went from worse to worse I had that dismal satisfaction
of the political opposer, that the blacker the affairs of
State, the more promising was the outlook for my own
career—up to a point that was. It needed only a slight
degree of wishful thinking for me to convince myself,
first that the Chamberlain Government could not last
much longer, secondly that when the General Election
came—as it must do very shortly—I would sweep the
Bewdley Division for the Liberal Party. Even when

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The call to political work again seized me, so that in
the early spring of 1939, abandoning the beer and the
darts, after placing the hotel under the care of ex-N.O.
Derek Kenderdine, I began to devote almost my whole
time and energy to campaigning in the Bewdley Division.


"Turn out the Appeasers." "Stand by those who have
stood by moral principle." "Why was not Mr. Churchill
in the Government?"


Whatever mood I had suffered from during the winter's
inactivity gave place to one of exalted moral enthusiasm
as once again I toured the countryside with loudspeaker
equipment. Who was to lead the moral crusade against
Hitler? Would it be the short-sighted Appeasers? Or
would it be those who had stood for right policies? I
asked myself these questions. I asked my audiences the
same questions as I toured the villages of West Worcestershire,
fired with zeal, preparing for the General Election
which must surely come at any time.


But though I preached resistance to aggression and
believed in the imminence of war, I had no premonition
whatsoever of what would happen when it came.
