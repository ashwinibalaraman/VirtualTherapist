Although the bruises and scars of physical abuse are more readily apparent, the
quiet assault of child neglect often does at least as much damage to its young
victims. Typically defined as an act of omission rather than commission, neglect
may or may not be intentional. It is sometimes apparent (as in the unkempt appearance
of the child who comes to school without a bath or adequate clothing) and
sometimes nearly invisible until it is too late. Neglect is often fatal, due to inadequate
physical protection, nutrition, or health care. Sometimes, as in the case of "failure to
thrive," it is fatal because of a lack of human contact and love. In some cases, neglect
slowly and persistently eats away at children's spirits until they have little will to connect
with others or explore the world.


In this chapter, we present a brief overview
of what is known about child neglect.
First, within the context of a historical look
at society's increasing awareness of neglect,
we discuss definitions of neglect and its various
subtypes. Second, we review research
findings on the impact of neglect on children's
health and development, including
data from our own longitudinal study of the
consequences of emotional neglect. Then
we discuss what is known about the underlying
causes and correlates of neglect, with
an emphasis on those factors that may be
amenable to change through preventive intervention.
Finally, we briefly discuss what
this information suggests for future research
and practice.

<b>Developing Awareness of Neglect</b>

Although children have been abused and
neglected for centuries, the recognition of
maltreatment as a social problem is relatively
recent. Forty years ago, Kempe's landmark
paper on the "battered child" (Kempe,
Silverman, Steele, Droegemueller, &amp; Silver,
1962) spurred a dramatic increase in public
awareness of the impact of overt, intentional
physical abuse. Widespread recognition of
neglect, however, lagged far behind, even
though neglect is more prevalent than abuse
(McDonald &amp; Associates, 1999) and has
been shown to have consequences that are
just as serious (e.g., Egeland, 1997; Erickson,
Egeland, &amp; Pianta, 1989). Some experts
have contended that neglect (emotional neglect,
in particular) is the central feature of
all maltreatment. For example, Newberger
wrote as early as 1973 that "the essential element
in child abuse is not the intention to
destroy a child but rather the inability of a
parent to nurture [his or her] offspring"
(p. 15). Nevertheless, neglect continued to
receive far less attention than abuse, both
publicly and professionally, even into the
mid-1980s (Wolock &amp; Horowitz, 1984). A
perusal of current popular publications suggests
that even now public attention still
is aimed primarily at sensational cases of
severe physical assault and injury. Neglect
may or may not be intentional. It is sometimes
apparent (as in the unkempt appearance
of the child who comes to school without
a bath or adequate clothing) and
sometimes nearly invisible until it is too late.


Furthermore, the attention given to neglect
(and also to abuse) for many years focused
only on observable physical effects.
Neglect often leaves obvious physical signs,
as in the case of gross malnourishment or accidents
stemming from a caregiver's failure
to protect the child from injury. But many
types of neglect, including emotional neglect,
typically leave no physical marks.
These less obvious forms of neglect nevertheless
can have a devastating impact on
the child's development (Egeland, 1997;
Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987; Erickson &amp;
Egeland, 1995).


It was only in the late 1980s that public
awareness began to expand to include recognition
of the often profound psychological
consequences that stem from even the
most subtle neglect. Some experts contended
that psychological consequences
were the unifying factor in all types of maltreatment
(e.g., see Brassard, Germain, &amp;
Hart, 1987). Subsequent research by
Crittenden and her associates presented a
strong case for the impact of psychological
maltreatment, regardless of the presence or
severity of physical injury (Claussen &amp;
Crittenden, 1991). Whether or not the
child sustained physical injury, at the core of
maltreatment was lasting damage to the
child's sense of self and the resultant impairment
of social, emotional, and cognitive
functioning.

<b>Definitions and Subtypes of Neglect</b>

Neglect means many things to many people
(Black &amp; Dubowitz, 1999; Zuravin,
1999). Definitions may vary depending on
whether one takes a legal, medical, psychological,
social service, or lay perspective (see
Chapter 14, this volume, for a discussion
of neglect from the medical perspective).
Out of necessity, legal definitions tend to be
the most elaborate and at least aspire to
some level of precision (Flannery, 1979;
Giovannoni, 1989; Wald, 1976). But even
within the legal arena, there is great variability
among definitions of neglect. Some of
that variability is due to the fact that maltreatment
statutes fall into three different
categories, each with a different purpose
and therefore a somewhat different interpretation
of what constitutes neglect. The three
categories include reporting laws that define
who should make reports of maltreatment
and under what conditions, dependency
statutes that define which children may be
made wards of the court, and criminal statutes
that define a criminal act for purposes
of prosecution. Even within any given category

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other perspectives beyond the legal system
may take an even broader, more inclusive
view of neglect. For example, some
groups of professionals advocate intervention
in neglect cases that would not necessarily
meet the criteria of the law. In an early
study of perceptions of neglect, Boehm
(1962) surveyed a large sample of community
leaders from various professions, asking
them to respond to vignettes describing
various kinds of neglect. Teachers, nurses,
social workers, and clergy were more likely
to judge the cases as requiring intervention
than were lawyers.


An even broader view of neglect was put
forth in <i>Today's Children: Creating a Future for a
Generation in Crisis</i> (1992) by David Hamburg,
president of the Carnegie Corporation
Foundation. Calling attention to the
plight of today's children, Hamburg indicted
U.S. society for "collective neglect" in
failing to provide adequate health care, child
care, preschool education, and policies that
support families in caring for their children.


A general definition of neglect was embedded
in the Child Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-247), which
defined abuse and neglect as
<blockquote>
<p>
the physical or <i>mental injury</i>, sexual abuse or
exploitation, <i>negligent treatment</i>, or maltreatment
of a child under the age of 18, or the age
specified by the child protection law of the
state in question, by a person who is responsible
for the child's welfare under circumstances
which indicate that the child's health
or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby as
determined in accordance with regulations
prescribed by the Secretary, (emphasis added)
</p>
</blockquote>


the physical or <i>mental injury</i>, sexual abuse or
exploitation, <i>negligent treatment</i>, or maltreatment
of a child under the age of 18, or the age
specified by the child protection law of the
state in question, by a person who is responsible
for the child's welfare under circumstances
which indicate that the child's health
or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby as
determined in accordance with regulations
prescribed by the Secretary, (emphasis added)


It is common for states to define abuse
and neglect together rather than provide
separate legal definitions for each. It is a
moot issue in most courts whether the child
was injured through an act of commission
(abuse) or omission (neglect).


Beyond such overarching definitions of
maltreatment, specific interpretations of
what "neglect" encompasses vary along several
dimensions. One controversy has centered
on whether actions can be defined as
neglectful regardless of their apparent impact
on the child. Must there be clear, immediate
evidence of harm or "mental injury,"
or is an apparent "threat" to the child's
well-being sufficient? For example, Brassard
et al. (1987) cite one definition of mental injury
as referring to <i>substantial, observable impairment</i>
in the child's ability to perform and
behave within a normal range with due regard
to his or her cultural background.


Others would argue that actions could be
neglectful regardless of their immediate observable
impact on the child's functioning.
Certainly our own research on the long-term
consequences of various patterns of
maltreatment, discussed later in this chapter,
suggests that the impact of neglect may become
apparent later in the child's development,
even if it is not immediately obvious.
Thus, a definition that demands immediate,
observable effects would overlook many
cases of neglect. At the groundbreaking
1983 International Conference on Psychological
Abuse, the interdisciplinary group of
participants proposed a definition of psychological
maltreatment that included both
immediate and ultimate (i.e., manifest at a
later point) damage to the child's behavioral,
cognitive, affective, or physical functioning
(Brassard et al., 1987). This raises
the question of whether we know enough
about the impact of neglect to say with some
confidence that a given act would be expected
ultimately to do damage to the child.
Many working in this field would argue
strongly that we do know enough.


Another definitional issue regarding neglect
that is of particular salience within the
legal arena has to do with the intentionality
of the act. Dubowitz and his colleagues have
argued for a definition based on the unmet
needs of the child, regardless of parental intentions
(Dubowitz, 1999; Dubowitz, Black,
Starr, &amp; Zuravin, 1993). Although intentionality
can be a critical variable in determining
legal culpability, the end result for the child
may be the same whether the parent is will-fully
neglectful (e.g., out of hostility) or neglectful
due to factors such as ignorance, depression,
or overwhelming stress and
inadequate support. From either an intervention
or prevention perspective, identifying
the factors that underlie the neglect is
important to eliminate or ameliorate those
factors and ensure that children receive the
care and protection they need and deserve.


In considering neglect, parental motives
cannot be dichotomized simply as intentional
or unintentional. Motives also need to
be considered within the context of the parents'
culture and beliefs. Garbarino (1991)

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As health care providers, mental health
professionals, and lawmakers have grown in
their understanding of neglect, definitions
have been refined and elaborated. Several
subtypes of neglect have been identified, including
the following:


<i>Physical neglect</i>. This is the most widely
recognized and commonly identified form
of neglect. It includes failure to protect from
harm or danger and provide for the child's
basic physical needs, including adequate
shelter, food, or clothing.


<i>Emotional neglect</i>. In many cases, this type
of neglect is more difficult to document or
substantiate because of the absence of clear
physical evidence and the fact that it goes on
quietly in the privacy of the home, often beginning
when children are too young to
speak out or even know that they are not receiving
appropriate care (see Chapter 4, this
volume). In its extreme form, however, emotional
neglect can lead to nonorganic failure
to thrive. This produces stunted growth
and physical illness or anomalies and is often
fatal.


In discussing definitions of emotional neglect,
Brassard et al. (1987) cited the American
Humane Association, which describes
emotional neglect as "passive or passive/aggressive
inattention to the child's emotional
needs, nurturing, or emotional well-being"
(p. 267). In our own research, we have used
the term <i>psychologically unavailable</i> to describe
parents who overlook their infants' cues and
signals, particularly the children's cries and
pleas for warmth and comfort. As discussed
later in this chapter, we have found this subtle
form of neglect to have serious long-term
consequences for young victims. The antithesis
of emotional neglect is emotional availability,
thoughtfully discussed by Biringen
and Robinson (1991). These authors reconceptualized
availability as a relational construct,
taking into account both parent and
child behavior, and proposed a multidimensional
approach to describing emotional
availability that includes parental sensitivity,
child responsiveness, parental nonintrusiveness,
and child involvement of the parent. In
their representation of availability as a continuous
variable, emotional neglect would
be at the extreme end of that continuum.


Definitions of neglect, however, are in
part a function of time and place. What we
today call emotional neglect would not have
been recognized as such not so many years
ago. In fact, in the 1920s, experts advised
parents against sentimental handling of babies
and urged them to let their babies cry so
that they would learn that their parents were
in charge (Newson &amp; Newson, 1974). (As we
discuss later, that notion has not disappeared
completely.)


Definitions of emotional neglect also may
vary somewhat depending on cultural context.
For example, Korbin (1980) pointed
out that in some cultures, our Western practice
of making young children sleep alone in
their rooms at night would be viewed as
emotional neglect. This illustrates that although
there is agreement that emotional
neglect involves inattention to the child's
needs, there is not universal agreement on
exactly what those needs are.


<i>Medical neglect</i>. This refers to caregivers'
failure to provide prescribed medical treatment
for their children, including required
immunizations, prescribed medication, recommended
surgery, or other intervention in
cases of serious disease or injury. This type
of neglect has raised some of the most controversial
legal issues in the field of child
protection, particularly in regard to cases in
which the parents' religious beliefs conflict

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Mental health neglect</i>. Similar to medical neglect,
this refers to caregivers' refusal to
comply with recommended corrective or
therapeutic procedures in cases in which a
child is found to have a serious emotional or
behavioral disorder. Although Hart (1987)
proposed standards and procedures for legal
and social service intervention in regard to
this subtype of neglect, it is not addressed
widely as a form of maltreatment.


<i>Educational neglect</i>. In the legal arena, educational
neglect refers to caregivers' failure
to comply with state requirements for
school attendance. Among educators and
mental health professionals, it also may be
used more broadly to encompass the parents'
lack of cooperation or involvement in
their children's schooling or the parents' resistance
to follow through with special programs
or interventions recommended by
the schools. However, given the scope of parental
rights and choices in regard to their
children's education, such broad definitions
are not likely to be incorporated into legal
definitions of neglect.

<b>The Impact of Child Neglect</b>

Although abuse still garners more public
attention, neglect is the most common type
of reported maltreatment. Based on a
50-state survey of child protective services
(GPS) agencies in the United States, an estimated
2.3 million children were reported as
victims of child abuse and neglect in 1997.
Of those, approximately 54% were reported
for neglect, as compared with 24% for physical
abuse, 12% for sexual abuse, 6% for
emotional maltreatment (some of whom experienced
emotional neglect), and 13% for
other forms of maltreatment (McDonald &amp;
Associates, 1999). Approximately 55% of
reported neglect cases received postinvestigative
services. It is likely that the actual incidence
of neglect is much higher than reporting
statistics indicate. Because neglect
(particularly emotional neglect) often leaves
no visible scars, it is likely to go undetected.
Furthermore, many victims of neglect are infants
who are too young to speak out about
the treatment they experience. Because neglect
is often chronic rather than episodic,
these children also may grow up thinking
this is the way life is, not realizing that their
experience constitutes maltreatment.


<b>Long-Term Developmental
Consequences of Neglect</b>


The 1970s saw a burgeoning interest in
studies of the consequences of maltreatment.
Early studies, which focused primarily
on children who were physically abused,
usually presented clinical evidence or descriptive
statistics without using control
groups. These studies pointed to a disproportionate
number of children who performed
below average on standardized intelligence
tests (e.g., Martin, Beezley, Conway,
&amp; Kempe, 1974; Morse, Sahler, &amp; Friedman,
1970; Sandgrund, Gaines, &amp; Green, 1974)
and who exhibited varied social and emotional
problems, including hostility, aggression,
and passive, withdrawn behavior (e.g.,
Galdston, 1971; Kempe &amp; Kempe, 1978;
Martin &amp; Beezley, 1977). In one of the first
studies specifically to include neglected children
among maltreated subjects, Steele
(1977) found learning problems, low self-esteem,
and, in subsequent years, a high incidence
of juvenile delinquency.


The 1980s saw reports from several studies
comparing maltreated children with control
groups of nonmaltreated children. Some
studies also made comparisons between
children who were abused and those who
were neglected. For example, Reidy (1977)
found that both abused and neglected children
behaved more aggressively in school
than nonmaltreated children, but abused
children exhibited more aggression during
fantasy and free play than the neglected children.


Hoffman-Plotkin and Twenty man (1984)
reported that abused children were more aggressive
than either neglected or nonmaltreated
children, but the neglected children
interacted less with peers than either
abused or nonmaltreated children. Similarly,
Crittenden (1985b; Crittenden &amp;
Ainsworth, 1989) found that abused children
were described as having difficult tem-
peraments, became angry under stress, and
exhibited mild developmental delays. Neglected
children, on the other hand, were

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These findings on the apparent differences
in developmental consequences of
abuse and neglect point to the importance of
separating types of maltreatment when
studying their consequences. Otherwise,
combining abused and neglected children
for group data may obscure the ways in
which they differ from nonmaltreated children.
On the other hand, many children experience
more than one type of maltreatment;
groups will overlap, and the line
between subtypes usually is blurred. Thus,
it is important to keep this in perspective
when considering differences between neglect
and abuse and recognize that such research
is not always the hard science we
would hope it to be. Also, it may be important
to consider the consequences of multiple
types of maltreatment. (Our own Minnesota
Parent-Child Project, discussed later,
has attempted to address these questions.)


<i>Emotional neglect</i>. As difficult as it is to
draw a clear line between abused and neglected
children, it is even more difficult to
distinguish between children who are physically
neglected and those who are emotion
ally neglected. Most, if not all, children who
are physically neglected are also emotionally
neglected at least to some extent. However,
the converse is not always true. We
have seen a number of cases of children who
were emotionally but not physically neglected
(e.g., Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1987).
They were fed adequately, well clothed, and
received proper health care, but their care
givers did not respond to their emotional
needs.


As mentioned earlier, the most extreme
consequences of emotional neglect are labeled
as the <i>nonorganic failure to thrive syndrome</i>,
which involves failure to grow--or sometimes
even to survive--despite adequate
nourishment (Gardner, 1972; MacCarthy,
1979; Patton &amp; Gardner, 1962). Even after
diagnosis and intervention, the psychological
consequences of emotional neglect persist.
In a clinical follow-up of infants who
had been diagnosed as failure to thrive,
MacCarthy (1979) reported notable attention-seeking
behavior and superficial displays
of affection after these children were
placed out of the home. Later in their childhood,
these children were described as spiteful
and selfish, and they reportedly engaged
in stealing. Likewise, Polansky, Chalmers,
Buttenwieser, and Williams (1981) chronicled
the defiant, hostile behavior of young
adolescents who, in infancy, had been diagnosed
as failure to thrive. Hufton and Oates
(1977) also found that failure-to-thrive children
presented varied academic and behavior
problems in the early elementary grades.


Even in cases much less profound than
failure to thrive, the long-term consequences
of emotional neglect are remarkable. As
reported in detail in earlier papers (Egeland
&amp; Erickson, 1987; Egeland, Sroufe, &amp;
Erickson, 1983; Erickson et al., 1989), our
own research on children with psychologically
unavailable parents provides powerful
testimony to the impact of this form of
neglect. We examined the development of
these same children through adolescence
and again compared them with nonmaltreated
children within our same high-risk
sample (Egeland, 1997). Both our earlier
findings and the more recent preliminary
analyses of our follow-up data are summarized
in a subsequent section of this chapter.


<b>Some Methodological Considerations
in Studying the Effects of Neglect</b>


It is not easy to examine the impact of neglect
and sort it from the many variables
that influence a child's development. It often
has been noted that many maltreated children
live in poverty or in families characterized
by other kinds of problems. Therefore,
it can be difficult to ascertain to what extent
a child's subsequent problems are due to the
maltreatment itself or to other aspects of the
environment. For example, in a frequently
cited study, Elmer (1977) found few differences
between abused and nonabused children
within a poverty sample, leading her to
conclude that the impact of poverty and
other environmental factors associated with
it may override the effects of abuse. It has
been noted elsewhere, however (e.g., Aber &amp;
Cicchetti, 1984; Erickson et al., 1989), that
the nonabused children in Elmer's sample
were matched to the abused children not

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although it is relatively easy to control
for poverty and other sociodemographic
variables, it is more challenging to separate
the effects of maltreatment from other aspects
of the home environment and family
functioning. For example, other researchers
have pointed to the general dysfunction
among families in which intrafamilial sexual
abuse has occurred, and some contend that
general dysfunction, rather than the sexual
abuse per se, accounts for children's poor
psychological outcomes (e.g., Giaretto,
1976; Herman &amp; Hirschman, 1981; Rosenfeld,
1977). Likewise, child neglect is often
embedded in a larger pattern of dysfunction
and, in many cases, environmental chaos,
making it difficult or impossible to separate
the impact of neglect from other environmental
influences. Although this is problematic
from a research perspective, such distinctions
may be less meaningful from a
prevention or treatment perspective; intervention
efforts most likely will need to address
the entire matrix of home and family
variables that support or impede children's
development.


Another critical methodological issue involves
taking into account the age and developmental
stage of the children being
studied. Early studies of maltreatment described
consequences with little regard for
age, often combining children of widely
varying ages. Yet, given how rapidly and dramatically
children's behavior changes over
time, consequences of maltreatment will
probably be manifest in different ways at different
periods of development. Neglect may
be operationalized differently, depending
on the age and developmental needs of the
child (Biringen &amp; Robinson, 1991; Erickson
&amp; Egeland, 1987). More recently, cross-sectional
studies have looked at children
within a narrower age range, and longitudinal
studies have followed children through
different stages of development, assessing
child behavior within the framework of salient
issues at each stage.


Many of the developmentally sensitive
studies have focused on infancy and early
childhood. For example, in one of the early
studies in that wave of research, Gaensbauer,
Mrazek, and Harmon (1980) examined
the development of affective communication
between infants and their caregivers,
comparing maltreated and nonmaltreated
infants. They observed developmental and
affective delays among one group of children
who were hypothesized to have experienced
extreme neglect. Other children who
performed normally on developmental
tasks but presented depressed affect were
believed to have received adequate care in
early infancy, followed by separation from
their caregivers or emotional neglect due to
maternal depression.


Much of the more recent research on
maltreated infants has been guided by attachment
theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1973,
1980) and facilitated by the Strange Situation
Procedure for assessing the quality
of parent-infant attachment (Ainsworth,
Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978). This assessment
procedure, used most often when the
child is 1 or 2 years of age, has been demonstrated
to be a valid and reliable measure of
the infant's adaptation within the context of
the infant-caregiver relationship, and it is
predictive of the child's subsequent behavior
in a variety of situations (e.g., see
Bretherton &amp; Waters, 1985). Infants who
have secure relationships with their primary
caregivers are more competent at later
ages than children whose attachment was
classified as anxious-resistant or anxious-avoidant
in the Strange Situation. Anxiously
attached children are more likely to exhibit
problems in cognitive and emotional functioning
(e.g., Erickson, Sroufe, &amp; Egeland,
1985; Sroufe, 2000; Warren, Huston,
Egeland, &amp; Sroufe, 1997).


Several studies have found maltreated
children, including those who are neglected,
to have a high incidence of anxious attachment.
This is not surprising because primary
determinants of the quality of attachment
are the parent's responsiveness and
sensitivity to the baby's cues and signals
the antithesis of maltreatment (Egeland &amp;
Farber, 1984; van Ijzendoorn, 1995). In the
Harvard Maltreatment Project, maltreated

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Illustrative of the importance of taking
development into account when looking at
the consequences of maltreatment,
Crittenden (1985a, 1992) found interesting
differences between abused and neglected
children at 2 years of age. Abused children
appeared angry during their first year of life
but inhibited that anger with their mothers
at 2 years of age. Neglected children did not
show such a change in strategy, and
Crittenden contends that the abused children's
inhibition reflects the 2-year-olds'
new ability to form expectancies about their
parents' behavior.


<i>The Minnesota Parent-Child Project</i>. One of
the first major studies to address systematically
the methodological considerations discussed
earlier was the Minnesota Mother-Child
Project. This is a prospective, longitudinal
study designed to follow the development
of a sample of 267 children born to
first-time mothers identified as being at risk
for parenting problems due to poverty,
youth, low education, lack of support, and
unstable life circumstances. Recruited
through obstetric clinics during the second
trimester of pregnancy, these women, their
children, and their life circumstances have
been assessed regularly, using multiple
methods and measures, through early adulthood
(see Egeland, 1997; Erickson et al.,
1989; Pianta, Egeland, &amp; Erickson, 1989).


Although the Minnesota Parent-Child
Project has examined the entire qualitative
range of caregiving, a major focus has
been on the antecedents of abuse and neglect,
as well as the long-term consequences
of maltreatment on children's development.
At different points in time, we identified
three groups of children who were maltreated,
based on observations and other
data collected since birth. For example, in
the period of 0 to 54 months, we identified
physically abused, neglected, and children
whose mothers were psychologically unavailable,
that is, emotionally neglectful.
(Note that there was overlap in the groups,
with some children experiencing physical
abuse in addition to other types of maltreatment.)


Of particular interest for this chapter are
the neglected children and those with psychologically
unavailable caregivers. Mothers
in the "neglectful" group did not provide appropriate
health care, physical care, or protection
for their children--either through incompetence
or irresponsibility. Although
these mothers sometimes expressed concern
and interest in their children's welfare, their
care for their children was inconsistent and
inadequate. Mothers in the psychologically
unavailable group appeared detached and
unresponsive to their children's bids for care
and attention. When they did interact with
their children, it was in a mechanical and
perfunctory manner, with no apparent joy
or satisfaction in the relationship.


As reported in detail in previous publications,
we compared each of these maltreatment
groups with a group of nonmaltreated
children from within the same high-risk
sample (Egeland &amp; Sroufe, 1981; Egeland
et al., 1983; Erickson et al., 1989), using as
outcomes a wide range of measures administered
over time and across multiple situations.
Children in all maltreatment groups
functioned poorly in a variety of situations
from infancy through the preschool period.
For those who were maltreated in infancy,
there was a high incidence of anxious attachment
compared with the control group.


Among neglected children, two thirds
were anxiously attached at 1 year of age. At
almost 2 years of age, when videotaped in a
problem-solving task with their mothers, neglected
children lacked enthusiasm, were
easily frustrated, displayed considerable anger,
and were noncompliant. When videotaped
with their mothers in a series of teaching
tasks, neglected children showed little
enthusiasm or persistence and were angry,
noncompliant, and often avoidant and
unaffectionate toward their mothers, even
though they were highly dependent on them
for help. Also at 42 months, in an independent

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In many ways, our study shows the consequences
of <i>emotional neglect</i> (or what we call
psychologically unavailable parenting) to be
even more profound than physical neglect
and the other types of maltreatment. Nearly
all of the children in this group were anxiously
attached, with the majority of those
classified as anxious-avoidant. In each of the
assessments at 24 and 42 months, they displayed
anger, noncompliance, lack of persistence,
and little positive affect. Probably the
most dramatic finding for these children was
their steep decline in performance on the
Bayley Scales of Infant Development between
9 and 24 months. In the preschool
classroom, at approximately 54 months of
age, these children presented varied and serious
behavior problems. They continued to
be noncompliant and negativistic, impulsive,
and highly dependent on teachers, and
they sometimes displayed nervous signs,
self-abusive behavior, and other behaviors
considered to be indicators of psycho-pathology
(Egeland et al., 1983). Although
the maltreatment they experienced was the
most subtle of all groups, the consequences
for the children were the most striking.


For children who were maltreated during
the preschool period, the physically neglected
presented the most problems. In kindergarten,
they were inattentive and uninvolved
in learning, anxious, aggressive, and
unpopular with peers. Their performance
on standardized tests of intellectual functioning
and academic achievement were the
lowest of all the maltreatment groups.
Children who experienced emotional neglect
(psychologically unavailable parents)
at this stage of life also presented significant
problems in the classroom. However, the
impact was not as dramatic as for the children
who experienced that kind of maltreatment
during the first 2 years of life.


<i>Follow-up assessments of emotionally neglected
children</i>. Assessments done when the children
in this sample were in elementary
school included information gathered from
the classroom teachers in Grades 1, 2, 3, and
6. Teachers completed the Child Behavior
Checklist on each child (Achenbach &amp;
Edelbrock, 1980), and, before they knew
who the target child was, they also rank-ordered
all the students in their classroom on
dimensions of peer acceptance and emotional
health. Children also were administered
the Peabody Individual Achievement
Test (Dunn &amp; Markwardt, 1970) in each of
the four grades.


Analyses indicate that children who experienced
psychologically unavailable parenting
in the first 2 years of life continued to
have problems throughout the elementary
school years. When compared with nonmaltreated
children from the same high-risk
sample, these emotionally neglected children
were ranked low by their teachers on
both peer acceptance and overall emotional
health. On the Child Behavior Checklist,
they were rated at all grade levels as being
more socially withdrawn, unpopular with
peers, and, in general, exhibiting more problems
of the internalizing type. In the early
grades, they also were rated as more aggressive
and less attentive. On the Peabody Individual
Achievement Test, these children performed
significantly lower at every grade
level than the nonmaltreated children in the
sample. When these emotionally neglected
children were compared with children who
had been physically abused in the early
years of life, there were no variables on
which the physically abused children did
significantly worse than the emotionally neglected
children, although the emotionally
neglected children were more withdrawn
and inattentive than the physically abused
children (Erickson &amp; Egeland, 1996). The
physically and emotionally neglected children
were high on the internalizing and
externalizing scores of the Child Behavior
Checklist--Teacher's Report Form (CBCT)
compared with the control groups. In addition,
both neglect groups were ranked low
on peer acceptance and emotional health
compared with the control group. The physically
neglected children were low academically
and had difficulty organizing themselves
to cope with the everyday demands of
school. Only one neglected child from a total
of 19 was not receiving some level of special
education services in kindergarten
through Grade 3. The physically neglected
children missed more than 60 days of school
between kindergarten and the third grade
compared with 41 days for the control children,
and for all maltreated children, the
teachers indicated that maltreating parents

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

According to Erik Erikson (1963) and
others, the salient development issue of middle
childhood is initiative. Using items from
teacher ratings on the Devereux Elementary
School Raring Scale (e.g., works independently,
persistent, well organized, able to follow
directions, stays on task until completed),
we constructed an initiative scale
and found that all maltreated children, particularly
the physically neglected, were
lower on this scale compared with the control
group (Egeland, Hyson, Yates, &amp;
Roisman, 1999).


In summary, the impact of neglect on
children's development was at least as damaging
as other more overt types of abuse.
Physical neglect, particularly during the pre-school
and primary grades, seriously impaired
the children's school behavior. And
emotional neglect, especially during the first
2 years of life, had a particularly striking and
long-lasting impact on children's adaptation
within the family, with peers and teachers,
and in regard to learning and problem solving.
The effects of neglect are above and beyond
the negative impact of poverty and its
correlates on children's development.


A further follow-up in adolescence of
children who were maltreated in the early
years indicated that maltreated children in
general were experiencing a variety of problems.
The problems that seemed to be more
severe in the physical neglect group involved
low achievement scores on an individually
administered achievement test and
high teacher ratings on the delinquency
scale of the Child Behavior Checklist, heavy
alcohol use, expulsion from school, and
dropout. Compared with the control group
and other maltreatment groups, the adolescents
whose parents were psychologically
unavailable at an early age displayed a number
of behavior problems. They were high
on the social problem, delinquency, and aggression
scales of the CBCT, and significantly
more attempted suicide compared
with the other maltreatment groups and the
controls. At age 17)½, we gave the K-SADS
(Kiddie--Schedule for Affective Disorders
and Schizophrenia), a diagnostic interview
for mental illness based on the <i>DSM-III-R</i>
(American Psychiatric Association, 1987).
The majority of maltreated children (90%)
received at least one diagnosis. The highest
rate was in the psychologically unavailable
group in which all but one of the children received
at least one diagnosis of psychiatric
disorder and 73% were comorbid for two
disorders or more. Fifty-four percent of the
physically neglected children were comorbid
compared with 30% for the control
group. In summary, maltreatment in the
early years had devastating consequences
for the children's overall functioning in adolescence.
According to teacher ratings, both
the physically and emotionally neglected
children had a variety of behavior problems
at age 16. In addition, the physically neglected
had high rates of academic failure
and school dropout, and the emotionally
neglected displayed high rates of
psychopathology (Egeland, 1997).

<b>Antecedents of Neglect</b>

A critical research question that has important
implications for prevention involves
the identification of variables that predict
which children are likely to be neglected.
The more we know about the antecedents of
neglect, the more precise our attempts will
be to identify and support families most at
risk. Unfortunately, little in the research
points to specific antecedents of neglect as
opposed to physical abuse or other types of
maltreatment. However, several studies provide
useful information about antecedents
and concomitants of maltreatment in general.
Historically, many studies followed a
psychiatric model, whereby abuse was seen
as a result of the parent's emotional illness,
with little attention paid to child characteristics
or to environmental conditions in which
the family functioned. In the past two decades,
however, literature reflects a shift toward
more interactive processes that take
into account the multiple variables that influence
quality of care. For example, in
1980, Belsky proposed an ecological model
of maltreatment that included four levels of
analysis: (a) ontogeny (the individual characteristics
associated with being a perpetrator
of maltreatment), (b) the microsystem
(family factors), (c) the exosystem (community
factors), and (d) the macrosystem (cultural
values and beliefs that serve to perpetuate
maltreatment). (See Belsky, 1993, for a
more recent elaboration of these ideas.) Similarly,
Cicchetti and Lynch (1993) elaborated
a transactional model suggesting that
maltreatment occurs when <i>potentiating factors</i>
(i.e., factors that increase the likelihood of
maltreatment) outweigh <i>compensatory factors</i>
(i.e., those that decrease the risk for maltreatment).
Factors were categorized further
into (a) enduring vulnerability factors, (b)

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Acknowledging that no single factor is
sufficient to explain maltreatment, studies
have begun to shed light on how these multiple
variables interact to render parents more
or less able to sustain adequate, appropriate
care for their children. Variables of interest
can be grouped broadly into parental
characteristics and attitudes, child characteristics,
and environmental factors. The
findings that have accumulated over the
past decade can be summarized briefly as
follows.


One set of variables that has distinguished
between maltreating and nonmaltreating
parents has to do with social-cognitive
and affective processes that are
tied to the parents' perceptions of their children
and the parent-child relationship. Specifically,
maltreating parents often are characterized
by a <i>lack of understanding</i> the
emotional complexity of human relationships,
especially the parent-child relationship.
They have difficulty seeing things
from the child's perspective or understanding
behavior in terms of the child's developmental
level and the context or situation.


Maltreating parents tend to think in
global, all-or-nothing terms rather than see
the shades of gray that more realistically
capture human behavior (Brunnquell,
Crichton, &amp; Egeland, 1981; Newberger &amp;
Cook, 1983; Sameroff &amp; Fell, 1984). Aber
and Zigler (1981) pointed to the importance
of the parents' own developmental level as a
determinant of how they think and behave
in regard to their children. Parental development
reflects the parents' own history of
care, their struggles with issues of dependency
and autonomy, and their level of cognitive
functioning. Parents with unresolved issues
of trust, dependency, and autonomy
are more likely to have difficulty understanding
and meeting the demands of their
children and may seek to meet their own
needs through the parent-child relationship
(Pianta et al., 1989). Maltreating parents
also have been found to have a high incidence
of depression (Lahey, Conger,
Atkenson, &amp; Treiber, 1984) and lack impulse
control, particularly when stressed
(Altemeier, O'Connor, Vietze, Sandler, &amp;
Sherrod, 1982; Wolfe, 1985).


Some researchers have focused on child
behavior as a contributing factor to child
maltreatment. Bell (1968) was one of the
first to call attention to the child's influence
on the parent in his important paper on the
bidirectionality of influence in the parent-child
relationship. Research in the 1970s
focused on infant irritability and fussiness as
contributing factors (Gil, 1970; Parke &amp;
Collmer, 1975; Thomas &amp; Chess, 1977).
However, retrospective designs and reliance
on temperament measures that may have reflected
parental perception more than actual
child behavior made it difficult to interpret
findings from such studies (Vaughn,
Deinard, &amp; Egeland, 1980). Others have
cited the relationship between maltreatment
and such child features as disabilities,
prematurity, and facial features (Belsky,
1980; McCabe, 1984). Biringen and Robinson
(1991) summarize studies that provide
some limited evidence of the child's contribution
to parental availability or unavailability.


Although few would dispute that some
children are more difficult to care for than
others, there is strong evidence from observational
studies that child characteristics
alone do not account for maltreatment. Research
taking a transactional view of parent-child
relationships demonstrated the
power of parental sensitivity and responsiveness
in overcoming the child's difficulty
(Brachfield, Goldberg, &amp; Sloman, 1980;
Sameroff &amp; Chandler, 1975). To muster the
emotional resources to counter the challenges
posed by a difficult child, parents
may need extra support, education, and encouragement.


Finally, research on the etiology of maltreatment
points to several environmental
characteristics that are contributing factors.
Again, these findings are not specific to
neglect but appear to be robust in regard
to maltreatment in general. Major environmental
factors include violence in the marital
relationship, parental unemployment,
and the availability of a helpful, supportive
social network, perhaps especially
among single parents who lack intimate
emotional support (Dubowitz, 1999). Data
from the Third National Incidence Study indicate
that, of all subtypes of maltreatment,
physical neglect is most clearly associated

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In our own data from the Minnesota Parent-Child
Project, we examined the antecedents
of specific subtypes of maltreatment, including
physical abuse, neglect, and
emotional neglect (psychologically unavailable
parenting). This work was described in
detail in Pianta et al. (1989). Specifically, we
found lack of social support and insularity
to characterize families in all maltreatment
groups. Maltreating families also experienced
more stressful life events than
nonmaltreating families within the same
high-risk sample. The home environments
of maltreating families differed from
nonmaltreating homes in terms of provision
of play materials and parental involvement
and responsivity to the child. The homes of
neglectful and sexually abusive families also
were observed to be more disorganized than
the homes of nonmaltreating families. Maltreating
mothers also presented more mood
disturbances. Psychologically unavailable
mothers were more tense, depressed, angry,
and confused than nonmaltreating mothers.
Neglectful mothers also were more tense,
and they functioned at a lower level intellectually
than mothers who provided adequate
care. Overall, the maltreating parents differed
markedly from nonmaltreating parents
on many variables, but the differences
by specific type of maltreatment were small.


Another variable of particular interest in
our study was the care the mother had received
in her own childhood. Among mothers
who were abused or neglected when
they were children, 40% maltreated their
children in the early years of their children's
lives, and an additional 30% provided borderline
care. Among mothers who were neglected
children, seven out of nine maltreated
their own children, and most of
these were cases of neglect (Pianta et al.,
1989).


Perhaps the most important question of
all is, What characterizes parents who rise
above their own history of abuse and provide
good care for their children? As described
elsewhere (Egeland, 1988; Egeland
&amp; Susman-Still man, 1996), four major factors
distinguished between mothers who
broke the cycle of maltreatment and those
who did not: (a) the presence of a loving,
supportive adult during their childhood,
someone who gave them a different view of
themselves and others; (b) a supportive partner
at the time they became parents; (c) therapeutic
intervention that enabled mothers to
come to some resolution of their early issues
and achieve greater emotional stability and
maturity, and (d) the fourth variable had to
do with mothers' integration of the maltreating
experiences into a coherent view of self.
Specifically, mothers who repeated the cycle
of maltreatment had significantly higher
scores on a measure of disassociation compared
with mothers who broke the cycle of
maltreatment.

<b>Summary and Discussion: Implications for Practice and Future Research</b>

Based on the research summarized here,
it is clear that neglect is a major societal
problem. According to CPS, more than 1.5
million children were reported for this form
of maltreatment in 1997 (McDonald &amp; Associates,
1999). And those were only the children
who showed up in child protection reports.
Considering how easily neglect can
be overlooked, it seems impossible to estimate
the actual scope of the problem.


We also can say with reasonable certainty
that neglect has a serious impact on children's
behavior across time and varied situations.
Neglected children, if they survive
physically, often fail to develop the confidence,
concentration, and social skills that
would enable them to succeed in school and
in relationships. The behavior they bring to
the classroom sets them up for a continuing
cycle of failure and disappointment unless
something happens to make a difference.


Even the most subtle kinds of emotional
neglect have a dramatic effect on children's
development, especially during the early
years of life. As we have discussed in detail
elsewhere, attachment theory provides a
useful framework for understanding the impact
of neglect. This theory proposes that
the infant's relationships with primary care-givers
are the prototypes for subsequent relationships.
Within those early relationships,
children develop expectancies about
how others will respond and about how effective
they will be in soliciting the responses
they need and want. Children then
behave in accordance with those expectancies,
and that, in a way, helps to perpetuate
the kind of relationship experiences they
have had.


For example, the child whose mother
fails to respond to his or her signals will

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Emotionally neglected children expect
not to get what they need from others, and
so they do not even try to solicit care and
warmth. They expect not to be effective and
successful in tasks, and so they do not try to
succeed. Or perhaps, these children's dependence
needs are so overwhelming that
they are barely able to concern themselves
with being motivated and task oriented. As
we have discussed elsewhere (e.g., Egeland
&amp; Erickson, 1999; Erickson &amp; Pianta, 1989),
teachers and peers are often put off by these
children's behavior, thus perpetuating their
previous relationship experience and reinforcing
their negative expectations of others
and self.


It is ironic that the impact of emotional
neglect is most profound when it is least
likely to be detected--when the child is too
young to speak out to others. (It is not surprising
that early neglect has such a strong
influence, because an infant's whole world
revolves around his or her primary caregivers.)
It is also ironic that, unless the child
shows clear physical signs of neglect (e.g.,
failure to thrive), intervention is not likely to
be mandated in cases of emotional neglect.
(At least that has been our experience; we
have not seen data to that effect.)


An interesting and useful direction for research
would be to see how professionals are
able to secure intervention or supportive
services for emotionally neglectful families
and to what extent they can get the system
to respond to these families who may not
meet the criteria for intervention by CPS.
Again, k has been our experience that it is
easy to fall into a catch-22 situation: Neglectful
families who may not qualify for mandated
intervention also may be the most difficult
to engage in voluntary service. Either
their lives are extremely disorganized (as is
often the case with the physically neglectful)
or the parents are distancing and perhaps
depressed (as is often the case with the emotionally
neglectful). The same factors that
make it difficult for parents to connect emotionally
with their children probably also
make it difficult for them to connect with
service providers or other potential sources
of support. If they feel that they are being
judged as failures in parenting, it will not be
any easier for parents to connect with service
providers.


Although the effectiveness of intervention
with neglecting families has not been
studied adequately, limited evidence suggests
that interventions are successful with
no more than 50% of families. The most effective
interventions are comprehensive and
relatively long term (Gaudin, 1993; Holden
&amp; Nabors, 1999).


Research does point to some of the early
indicators of parents who are likely to be
physically or emotionally neglectful, and
models of family support and early intervention
offer promise as prevention strategies
(Wolfe, 1993). In particular, maltreatment
is likely to occur among parents who
lack an understanding of their children's behavior
and the parent-child relationship, experience
a great deal of stress, are socially
isolated or unsupported, and have a history
of inadequate care themselves.


It is important to use knowledge of the
antecedents of maltreatment to find ways to
identify families at risk and address those
underlying factors in an effort to prevent neglect.
Health care providers, especially in
obstetric, perinatal, and pediatric settings,
may be in the best position to identify potentially
neglectful families. Because neglect is
particularly damaging in infancy, it is important
to work with families as early in the infant's
life as possible--or, preferably, even
before the baby is born. In our own preventive
intervention program, Project STEEP
(Egeland &amp; Erickson, 1990; Erickson &amp;
Egeland, 1999; Erickson, Korfmacher, &amp;
Egeland, 1992), we have found expectant
parents to be open to supportive, therapeutic
services prior to the birth of their first
child. Because they are not parents yet, they
do not feel that their child rearing is being
judged. And, as they anticipate the new experiences
of childbirth and parenting, they
are relatively open to the idea of sharing that
adventure with their STEEP home visitor

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In our opinion, one of the major directions
for both practice and research in the
area of child neglect is the implementation
and careful evaluation of programs designed
to prevent neglect. Neglect takes
many forms and reflects a variety of underlying
problems. It is likely that different
strategies will be needed for different families
facing different issues. One analysis of
34 prevention studies pointed to individualization
as a key to success (Wekerle &amp; Wolfe,
1993). Approaches will vary, depending on
factors such as the age and gender of the
child, the stage of family development, race,
ethnicity, and age and education of the parents.
Although k is impossible to design a
program to suit each unique family situation,
programs should be flexible enough to
meet families where they are, identifying
and building on individual and family
strengths. Programs must be designed, targeted,
and evaluated within a clearly articulated
theory on the development of maltreated
children and the factors that lead to
and perpetuate maltreatment. We believe
that attachment theory provides a good
place to begin.


The challenge for research then will be
to assess to what extent, for whom, and
under what conditions a program is effective
in preventing neglect and other types of
maltreatment. As we discover what really
helps to build strong families, we prevent
harm not only to the children in those families
but also to the children of subsequent
generations.
