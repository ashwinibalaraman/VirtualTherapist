DR. YALOM


GINNY appeared today in, what is for her, relatively good shape.
Her clothes have no patches on them, her hair has possibly been
brushed, her face seems less broken out and far more in focus. With
some awkwardness, she described how my suggestion to pay for
sessions with write-up rather than money had given her a new
lease on life. At first she had felt elated, but then managed to undercut
her optimism by making sarcastic jokes about herself to other
people. When asked what kind of sarcastic jokes they were, she
said I would probably publish our write-ups under the title of
"interviews with an ambulatory catatonic patient." Wanting to
clarify our arrangement, I assured her that whatever we wrote would
be joint property and if we published anything, we would do it
together. I told her it was premature and something that I hadn't
really considered (a lie, since I have had flitting fantasies of publishing
this material some day).


Then I tried to focus things a bit, lest we wander endlessly in the
haze so characteristic of time with Ginny. What did she want to
work on in therapy with me? Where did she hope to "go"? She
responded by describing her life now as generally empty and meaningless;
the most pressing problem is her difficulty with sex. I urged
her to be more explicit and she described how she could never allow
herself to let go just when she sensed she was at the point of orgasm.
The more she talked, the more she struck up chords within me of
some conversations I have recently had with Viktor Frankl (a prominent
existential analyst). She spends so much time thinking about
sex when she is in the midst of it, asking herself what she can do to
bring herself off, that she inhibits any possible spontaneity. I thought
of ways I might help de-reflect her and finally came out quite artlessly
with, "if only there were some way you could de-reflect yourself."
She reminded me of the centipede in a children's book who,
when asked to watch the way he walks, can no longer manage his
hundred pairs of legs.


When I asked her what her day was like, Ginny talked about how
empty time was for her, beginning with the emptiness of writing in

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later it happened again. I commented to her that her whole life
was played out against soft background music of self-abnegation.
There was an echo of what a Kleinian<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_3476');">[note]</a><div id="_note_3476" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">âˆ— A London-based analytic school founded upon the teachings of Melanie Klein.</div> analyst once told me years
ago when I considered entering analysis with him: that the analysis
would be carried out against the background music of my skepticism
of his theoretic position.


In a thread-like voice Ginny continued to present herself as a
person lacking both propulsion and direction. She is drawn to emptiness
like a magnet and sucks it up and spits it out in front of me.
One would think that nothing in her life exists except nothingness.
For example, she described sending some stories to <i>Mademoiselle</i> and
receiving an encouraging letter from the editor. When I asked her
when she had gotten the letter, she told me that it was only a few
days ago; I remarked that it could have happened years ago from
the apathetic tone of her voice. It's the same when she speaks about
Eve, a very good friend, or Karl, her boyfriend with whom she lives.
There is this little demon within Ginny stealing the meaning and
pleasure from everything she does. At the same time she tends to
observe herself and romanticize her plight in a tragic way. She flirts,
I think, with the vision of herself as a Virginia Woolf who one day
will fill her pockets with rocks and walk into the ocean.


Her expectations from me are so unrealistic, she sees me in such
an idealized way that I feel discouraged, sometimes hopeless, of ever
really making contact with her. I wonder if I'm not exploiting her
by asking her to write these reports. Maybe I am. I rationalize it by
saying that at least it forces her to write, and I do feel strongly that
after six months, when we exchange these notes, something good
will come of it. If nothing else, Ginny will have to begin to see me
in a different way.

GINNY


THERE must be a way to tell about the session other than repeating
exactly what happened and mesmerizing myself and you. I had
built up expectations, but I concentrated mostly on thinking of the
change in time schedule. I started and ended the session with that
busy thought. Fussing and not feeling.


I felt like a dilettante in your office, at first. You were asking me
what was on the agenda, what I wanted to happen. I have a long
history of not answering or taking questions seriously. I never use
my mind or cast it out further than the present, except when I use it
to fantasize. I don't let it change or shape reality, just comment on
its passing. Your insistence, though, when you kept repeating the
question, "Well, what does it mean--your writing not going anywhere?"
finally annoyed me. It was like a countdown in a fight. I
knew I had to get up at that point, and say something or it was all
over. After three or four repeats of that question, I said: "What I
guess I feel is that it's not the writing, it's the judgment thing in me
that doesn't go anywhere, that stays pointing to zero, fluctuating
slightly in either direction when there is applause or criticism." I
never let on, when I was talking about Karl and me in such a grey
voice, that Sunday and Monday mornings had been lovely, with
great tenderness and playfulness. Why did I misrepresent myself?
(My father's favorite criticism: "All your life you've downgraded
yourself, Ginny.") But why couldn't I come in and tell you some
good things, especially since I know you like to hear them?


When I was talking to you I was conscious of trying to remember
what I had said the time before. I wanted to be sure I didn't repeat
myself in this session. At the end, though, I thought I had.


I didn't want to go in and talk about sex since that always sounds
so Ann Landers and mature and impersonal. And besides, the importance
of sex happens with me not in the sometimes good, sometimes
bad, act but the reprisal the moment after. The occasion to
hate myself and fear punishment and recognition from someone
else and try to cope with the full-length darkness and conscience.

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When you used the word "de-reflect" so calmly I liked that a lot.
(Afterwards I used the word in three jokes that day.) I took it to
heart and was glad you wanted more from me than descriptions
and appearance.


Toward the end of the session, when I talked about Sandy, my old
friend who committed suicide, and my anger against parents who
don't listen to psychiatrists unless something specific is prescribed,
I was feeling anger without being aware of it. When it was over
I felt I was getting sad and quiet and open. I felt a mild sensation,
like pleasant nerves in a child dreaming of sex.


Then you commented that the session was over. Whenever I
sense that cue, I begin to feel tentative again. The light that has
been shining on me is about to go out. The psychiatrist's clumsy
parliamentary procedure to get the patient gone. "And would two
o'clock be all right?" you asked, which it wasn't, but I couldn't
think firsthand. Only while going home did I have time to gnaw
at that problem and make it into a big production number of
possibilities.


At the time I decided I wouldn't try hard to write up these
sessions, that I would let the style develop as my perceptions
and experiences did. I gave up before I started writing this. I felt
at the session like an exhausted person who has been reading and
reading because of habit, who has stared only at the hard structure
of print and not at the flight of words. Yesterday, like almost
always, I was so self-conscious, glued to my surface, superficial
structure of what I must say, what I must be. Reciting into a mirror.
One mirror that wouldn't be bad luck if it were broken. (But those
aren't fighting words. Just more yap.)


You said you wanted to hear only what happened in our sessions.
At first that seemed limiting and then refreshing, because
that cuts away the overhang of dense foliage. And you wouldn't
read it for six months, which means that the sessions won't be a
writing critique and there'll be no redeeming through words. And
then later it dawned on me you had said "six" months, which
was a comforting six months' guarantee.

DR. YALOM


THE SESSION was scheduled for 12:30. I saw Ginny in the waiting
room at 12:25. I had something in my hand I wanted to give
to my secretary, but it really wasn't important and I could have seen
Ginny at 12:25. As things worked out, I screwed around with something
relatively unnecessary and ended up taking her three minutes
late. I can't understand why I do this with patients. Sometimes, no
doubt, it is a measure of my own countertransference and resistance.
But not with Ginny, I enjoy seeing her.


She looked well today, with a neat skirt, blouse and tights, and her
hair almost brushed, but she was clearly very shaky and tremulous.
For the first twenty to twenty-five minutes of the session we floundered
without my knowing where the main thrust of the hour
should go. It turned out that she had an extremely bad time of it
last night, with waves of anxiety coming every ten to fifteen minutes,
and these tightly bound to past terrible feelings and experiences,
which seem to be the only things that give her a sense of continuity
and time.


I first fiddled around with the timing of her night anxiety spells,
wondering whether they were related to our sessions. There were
three last week--one occurred the night before and one after our last
hour, but the third one was somewhere in the middle of the week:
so that didn't take us very far. Dealing with the ideational content of
her anxiety spell was like walking on quicksand. I stepped in too
deeply, was sucked down, and spent most of the hour trying to
scramble out again, because it's all primitive, early, boundless
material.


The next thing I tried was a happier choice. I simply became concrete
and precise. I said, "Let's start from the beginning and really
track down your day yesterday and what happened last night." I do
this often with patients and advise my students to try out this approach,
since it rarely fails to provide some foothold out of the mire
of confusion. Well, Ginny went over her day--she had gotten up
feeling pretty good and wrote for an hour or two. Although she tried

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She also talked about last Saturday when Karl had been busy with
people all morning and had walked by himself the rest of the day,
not coming home until 8:30 at night, at which point she couldn't
even say that she would like to walk with him sometimes. She just
cried every time he came near her. I began to wonder about her ambivalent
feelings towards him especially when she described her
recurring fantasy that he would leave her and that she would go
to Italy with her friend Eve, and write and drink chocolate. Well,
all these things together made me think that despite her pledges of
selfless allegiance to Karl, there's a part of Ginny that wants to tear
loose from him. But it wasn't easy to pursue this; perhaps this is
something Ginny is unable to deal with right now. Maybe not--I
must not let her "fragile flower" pose control me to a point of impotent
gentleness.


What I did do was to flood the room with Viktor Frankl. Now it
happens that I had been reading one of his books last night and
thinking about him. It always makes me disgusted with myself to
read someone and then find myself using his techniques in my next
therapy session. Be that as it may, I approached her as I think Frankl
might have approached her, and I think I did rather well. The first
thing I suggested to Ginny is the notion that she was born with
anxiety, that her mother and father are anxious, and that it is not
inconceivable to think she actually has a genetic source of anxiety,

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next thing I did was to point out to her that an inborn excess
of anxiety and sexual tension (which I described in rather specific
terms, i.e., an inability to metabolize adrenalin properly) is really not
her core. She, Ginny, is something much more than these extrinsic
factors. I guess I was getting into an examination of basic values. I
asked her what it is in life that is really important to her, what she
really values, what she can stand for. I was tempted to ask what types
of things she would be willing to die for, but fortunately refrained.
Well, she said some of the "right" things, to my point of
view. She said she really wanted to get "into the light," "into the
mainstream;" she deeply treasures her experience with Karl, and she
ended by saying that her writing is very important. Naturally, like a
reflex, I pounced on this, at which point she immediately called her
writing "frivolous," adding that she knew I would say it wasn't. I
followed suit and said, "It isn't frivolous." She laughed. I continued
with the comments that no one else can do her writing for her, that
it is something she alone can do, and that it's important, even if no
one else ever reads it. She seemed to buy that, and that was about
the end of the hour. I was being somewhat authoritarian, but I think
that I've got to be with Ginny. I like her very much. I want to help
her very badly. It's hard to believe sometimes that a poor tragic
lilting little soul like this really exists and suffers so much.

THE SESSION was very important for me. I think I managed to
talk and think and feel through my tears. Not just cry and be
done with it. I could keep more to the point, and not let sarcasm
or charm get the upper hand. I reached a kind of balance.


I didn't use the therapy to take away my feelings. I felt less
strained at the end. I still appreciate that you talk and tell me
things. I don't feel like I'm in the room alone. If I were, I'd
get confused and wander. When you said that all people masturbate,
I burnt with shame because I thought you might be
telling me something about yourself. I couldn't look at you. I
pretend that everyone is structured and you can't see people's
lives in private, only mine, which is transparent.


I think the session helped me use the tension I had and have
to some good use and understanding.


I wonder why I always seem to place my men in a bad light,
though. In retelling incidents, I know you get a one-sided view.
It troubles me that I'm unfair and somehow I'll be punished.


I make it seem that Karl and I are like a frog and its insect in
a school aquarium--so tight; when actually there's a lot more
loose, good time between us than I let on. I guess I concentrate
on the bad times because they are so annihilating.


As far as abstaining goes, I live by that. "I won't do this and
maybe that will happen." I sort of have a checking account in
my head, where I always have to be in debt to come out ahead.


After the session I felt centered; less awkward. I could give in
to at least three impulses--to eat, to sit in the cactus grove near
Stanford's grave, and to take deep breaths of the plants and trees.


When you told me I looked better, I felt bad that I didn't tell
you how nice you looked in your landscape conglomeration of
russet suit and various colored stripes coming from everywhere
like rain. I withhold things.


Now whether I'll try the things you told me, I don't know. I
know they'll depress me at first and punish me temporarily. And

BETTER TODAY. What was better? I was better. In fact I was very
good today. It's almost as though I am performing in front of an
audience. The audience that will read this. No, I guess that isn't
completely true--now I'm doing the very thing I accuse Ginny of
doing, which is to negate the positive aspects of myself. I was being
good for Ginny today. I worked hard and I helped her get at some
things, although I wonder if I wasn't just trying to impress her, trying
to make her fall in love with me. Good Lord! Will I never be free
of that? No it's still there, I have to keep an eye on it--the third eye,
the third ear. What do I want her to love me for? It's not sexual
--Ginny doesn't stir sexual feelings in me--no that's not completely
true--she does, but that's not really important. Is it that I want to be
known by Ginny as the person who cultivated her talent? There
is some of that. At one point I caught myself hoping that she would
notice that some of the books in my bookcases were nonpsychiatric
ones, O'Neill plays, Dostoevsky. Christ, what a cross to bear! The
ludicrousness of it. Here I am trying to help Ginny with survival
problems and I'm still burdened down with my own petty vanities.


Think of Ginny--how was she? Pretty sloppy today. Her hair uncombed,
not even a straight part, worn-out jeans, shirt patched in a
couple of places. She started off by telling me what a bad night she
had had last week when she was unable to achieve orgasm, and then
couldn't sleep the entire night because she feared rejection from
Karl. And then she started to go back to the image of herself as the
same body of a little girl who used to lie awake all night when she

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So, too, with the next problem. She described how she had met
two friends on the street and how she had made, as usual, a fool of
herself. I analyzed that with her, and we got into some areas that
perhaps Ginny hadn't quite expected. She behaved with them in a
chance meeting on the street in such a way, she says, as to leave them
walking away saying, "Poor pathetic Ginny." So I asked, "What could
you have said that would have made them feel you were rather
hearty?" In fact, I proved to her there were some constructive things
she could have mentioned. She's trying out for an improvisational
acting group, she has done some writing, she has a boyfriend, she
spent an interesting summer in the country, but she can never say
anything positive about herself since it would, not call forth the
response, "Poor pathetic Ginny," and there is a strong part of her
that wants just that reaction.


She does the same thing with me in the session, as I pointed out to
her. For example, she had never really conveyed to me the fact that
she is good enough to work with a professional acting troupe. Her
self-effacing behavior is a pretty pervasive theme, going back to her
behavior in the group. I shocked her a bit by telling her that she
looked intentionally like a slob, that some day I'd like to see her looking
nice, even to the extent of putting a comb through her hair. I
tried to de-reflect her self-indulgent inner gaze by suggesting that
maybe her core isn't in the midst of her vast inner emptiness, that
maybe her core is as much outside of herself, even with other people.
I also pointed out to her that although it is necessary for her to look
inside to write, sheer introspection without writing or some other
form of creation is often a barren exercise. She did say that she has

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried to get her to discuss her notion of my expectations for her,
since this is a genuine blind spot for me. I suspect I have great
expectations for Ginny; am I really exploiting her writing talent so
that she will produce something for me? How much of my asking her
to write instead of paying is sheer altruism? How much is selfish? I
want to keep urging her to talk about what she thinks I'm expecting
of her; I must keep this in focus--the Almighty God "Countertransference"
-- the more I worship it the less I give to Ginny. What I
must not do is try to fill her sense of inner void with my own
Pygmalion expectations.


She's a fetching, likeable soul, Ginny is. Though a doctor's dilemma.
The more I like her as she is, the harder it will be for her
to change; yet for change to occur, I have to show her that I like her,
and at the same time convey the message that I also want her to
change.

(handed in three weeks later)


SOMETHING might happen if I were more natural looking. So I
left my glasses on. Something might not happen though.


I spoke about that bad Tuesday night which turned out to
have had a bad Tuesday beginning. The idea of a hearty, robust
me, which you suggested and asked for, was very encouraging.
My usual register of "success" is how much I have been released
and done difficult things, like crying or thinking straight without
fantasizing. And you pushed me in that direction.


I had fun at the session and before that could disturb me I

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was looking at your way of treating me, like an adult. I wonder
if you think I am pathetic or, if not, a hypocrite, or just an
old magazine that you read in a doctor's office. Your methods are
very comforting and absurd. You still seem to think that you can
ask me questions that I will answer helpfully or with insight. You
treat me with interest.


I think during the session that I am bragging, trying to show
myself off good. I am dropping little self-indulgent hints and
facts, like me being pretty (a real static fact), like the acting
group, like the good sentence I wrote (treading water in front
of your face). I know these are a waste of time since they don't
do me any good and are things that go through my head every
day with or without you. Even when you say, "I don't quite understand,"
that is a kind of flattery to my worst old habits of being
elusive in word and deed. And inside me I don't understand
either. God knows I know the difference between the things I say
and the things I feel. And my sayings are not satisfying most
times. The few times in therapy when I react in a fashion not
predestined by my mind, I feel alive in an eternal way.


So yesterday's experience was strange. I usually distrust the
things that are said. Parent pep talk. I give it to myself regularly.


But I didn't feel down when the session was over, or let down.
It was funny to hear you talk about my hair and dress. Kind of
like my father but not quite. Of course maybe you think Franny<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29363');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29363" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">âˆ— Group member.</div>dressed good. To me she looked attractive but always seemed an
arm's length away. I look like a badly bent hanger with the
clothes slipping off. I like to look heroic, like I've just done
something. Though I wish I didn't have such an uncanny burlesque
instinct in dressing. Sometimes I try and still look
schleppy.


The night after the session I couldn't sleep at all. There was
such a rush of blood in my chest and stomach and I could feel

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think it is wrong in therapy for me to be too self-conscious,
to say things like, "I am feeling something in my leg." Those
are probably cheap asides left over from sensory awareness
afternoons, that stop the direction you are heading me in. You
must get sick of them, infliction, indulgence.


It was funny when you said I couldn't make a career out of
schizophrenia. (I still think catatonia is right up my sleeve.)
In a sense this takes away a lot of the romance I have been
flirting with. I feel awkward and lacking and can't connect in
social situations. There must be another way. With Dr. M.---<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_30854');">[note]</a><div id="_note_30854" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">âˆ— Group co-therapist.</div> I think he thought the things I said were "far-out," weird, and
that they should be recorded for their nuances. I think you know
they're shit. I was always watching him write down things. I'm
not aware of your face too much except that it seems to be sitting
over there waiting for something. And you seem to have a lot of
patience. I don't like to look at your face cause I know I haven't
said anything. If it did light up at the wrong places, I'd begin to
distrust you.


In these first few sessions I think I can be as bad as I want,
so later the transition will seem lovely.

DR. YALOM


A FAINT metallic taste in my mouth after the interview. Not totally
satisfied. Subdued, that's the word for it. Ginny came in apologizing
for not having her description of the previous week's meeting.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then the next thing she says tends to confirm my suspicions. She
had seen me on Union Street in San Francisco with a woman. I
said that was my wife, which she seems to have taken for granted;
she added that the woman looked so young and pretty and that we
seemed so happy together and that she (Ginny) had a good feeling
about it. She also wondered whether that was the reason I hadn't
seen her last week--whether I had just simply decided to spend
the week with my wife. How did she feel about that? "Very good."
I had my doubts!


I asked her whether or not she changes what she writes when she
types it up. She states that she does sometimes. For example, the
previous week she took out something that sounded like active flirtation
with me because she was subsequently embarrassed at having
written it. So the whole first part of the session was a subdued, even
embarrassed interchange. I asked her at one point quite frankly
whether or not she could discuss the subterranean part of the session,
thinking that we could get at her unstated feelings. But she refused
to nibble, and instead insisted that there really was nothing else she
hadn't talked about. Things have gone so well, relatively speaking,
that she can't specify a single problem.


And indeed they seem to have gone well; the waking up at night
with terror seems to have subsided; she took the pill I gave her after
the last session, which broke the cycle, although she was careful to
let me know the pill wasn't entirely successful, since she had a real
drowsy depressed hangover following it. To tell the truth, I forgot
to write down exactly what medication I had given her: I remember
only that it was a very mild tranquilizer, which should not have

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was really impressed with how pretty she looked today. I have the
chairs at a Sullivanian ninety degree angle and was looking at her
more in profile. There have been times before, especially in the
group, when I considered Ginny rather homely, and yet today I saw
her as quite lovely.


Almost desperately attempting to provide me with an offering,
she volunteered a couple of dreams. We languished in them for a
few minutes, one of them presenting some pretty clear Oedipal components:
a dream in which she was lying in bed and a man came in
with a silver cigar for a penis. The associations to this had to do with
her lying awake at night when she was young, listening to the sounds
of a mattress squeaking which meant that her parents were having
intercourse, and then an episode when she was twenty-one when
she hurt her father by saying that her mother had once told her that
sex wasn't always everything in life. There is abundant evidence of a
desire to split her parents, to get between them, but it's folly for me
to get into this with Ginny. Reconstruction of the past, interpretations,
clarifications of this sort are not going to be helpful for Ginny.
Visiting the past with her is a beguiling, charming voyage; but she
knows the terrain far too well--it never fails to transport her away
from today and from the benefit which I know will come from our
understanding everything that happens between the two of us. So I
switched the subject to the present.


She has been preoccupied with the fantasy that Karl will leave her,
whereupon she'll go into a cabin in the woods and gradually become
more mature. She exclaimed that this is horrible because it must mean
that she wants Karl to leave her, but I pointed out that the fantasy
has some redeeming features in that it is life-oriented and does offer
the hope that she won't be extinguished if Karl were to leave. I used
some paradoxical intention by suggesting that she deliberately force
this fantasy to appear whenever Karl comes home late, and give it at

Toward the end of the session she quoted something from Alexander
Pope about a woman who seems similar to herself and she
doesn't want to be like that. Having not read Pope for fifteen or
twenty years, I found myself wishing that she would mention writers
I'm more familiar with so I could have responded with more savvy
and more ease. I think this also reflects some feelings of tension that
I have about tomorrow's presentation at the Modern Thought seminar
where my interest in literature is vastly exceeded by glaring gaps
in knowledge.

I WAS pretty nervous yesterday. I just grabbed at straws, thinking
of something to say, that's how seeing you that day with your
wife came up. I was inside the car with Eve discussing <i>The
Freedom of Sexual Surrender</i>, a book which discredits clitoral
orgasm as something that doesn't happen in a mature woman's
body. So in the middle of this sexual talk, you and your wife
crossed the crosswalk in front of us, like a stunt in a T.V.
comedy.


I saw that what I do is pretend that some part of me is doing
what actually I am doing. For instance, the last five minutes,
that "part of me" happened to look at your open pants and

I always like it when you give me directives. I become much
more aware of my behavior, not as something magical, but just as
behavior. Last night I became aware of how the fear starts. I
think of something, I hold my breath to listen, that hurts my
stomach, makes me feel like I'm in an elevator and can't get off.
And before I know it, I'm on an unlucky floor.


The session made me very nervous, more nervous than when
I went in.

AN ODD sort of session. I didn't think I'd be much good for
anything since I had only two hours sleep last night. I stayed at a
friend's home on the ocean, and the strangeness of sleeping outside
and the pounding of the waves had kept me up all night. I thought
then how ironic it was that I should be seeing Ginny the next day
since she has often come in with complaints of being unable to
sleep. My being awake last night was different in that it was a comfortable
state of wakefulness and I enjoyed watching and hearing the
ocean and reading Kazantzakis, but I've had those other kinds of
night too. Never do I feel more like a fraud than when after a sleepless,
anxious night I counsel some poor insomniac who in truth slept
more hours than I. But who would follow a general who on the eve
of battle walked around wringing his hands? I didn't cancel the hour
because I felt functional today and during the session was hardly
aware of my state of fatigue.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was approximately ten minutes late, though, and to help stay
awake brought a cup of coffee into my office, which is unusual. I did
offer her one, which she refused with embarrassment. She began by
talking about her envy of her younger sister, who is now visiting. She
sees her sister as so much more decisive, more "committed" than
she, for example, in choosing to live with someone. I tried to help
her understand the fact that this is only an attitudinal posture; I asked
her whether or not it meant that her sister really did have more of a
sense of commitment and wondered with her whether it meant only
that her sister could overlook some of the negative feelings she
had about a situation, or perhaps even engage in self-deception about
some of her conflicting feelings. What's to be envied about such
"positiveness"? She heartily agreed that this was so.


I then went on to talk with her about the little imp inside that
strips all pleasure from every one of her endeavors, stops her from
enjoying sex, enjoying her trip to Europe, from enjoying life. This
is it, her one and only life. No rainchecks, no replays when she is
feeling better. "Ginny, you're going through life right now and can't
postpone it till another time." I'm not sure how helpful that tact was.
Wasn't I being overly pedantic?


The other major theme was her anger or rather her lack of anger
in infuriating situations. For example, she talked about her relationship
to her landlady who is so maddening, so flighty that she
drives everyone crazy. Ginny's response to this woman is only to
"feel more dead inside" and to make a greater effort to be nice to her.
We worked on how a feeling of anger or annoyance toward the other
person can somehow get converted into a sense of personal deadness.
Later in the discussion I was afraid that she interpreted my comments
as a suggestion <i>not</i> to be nice to people and to let all her
angry feelings out, whereupon I reassured her that she shouldn't
feel ashamed of being "nice" or generous--these are genuine traits
which don't have to be reduced to something else, but it is necessary
for her to understand her true feelings in these situations. She went
on to say that when she engages in generous or altruistic acts, she
always manages somehow to turn them into vices, and I in effect told
her to stop this Freudian reductionism and accept generosity or
gentleness as positive and important truths about herself which stand
by themselves and don't require further analysis.


She doesn't talk much about her feelings toward me. She felt tense

GINNY dressed in patched jeans and appearing particularly
Ginny-gentle and Ginny-fragile. Speaking softly, she confessed that
she didn't have her write-up of last week--she hadn't written it till
five days after our last session, hadn't typed it up yet, and there is
even a possibility that she had lost it. I felt this was terribly important
and that we were going to have to spend a great deal of time on the
subject. She dug in her heels and wouldn't budge. She had no ideas
or associations to the issue when I brought it up. I got a bit stronger
each time around, stating, that, for example, it is highly unlikely that
she should suddenly forget her assignment; why is it now that five
days pass between her session and her review of it, whereas previously
she wrote it the day after? When she responded that she is lazy,
I pushed her further and asked why she is lazy <i>now</i>. But nothing
came of my question. I felt strongly she wasn't going to be able to
talk about anything else and so it was. She stumbled about trying to

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps the turning point, as I look back on it, appeared when I
said cryptically, "There is no magic after all." Ginny asked what I
meant, but I knew she knew, and she agreed that she knew even
after she asked the question. I meant that there was no magic after all
in my taking her out of the group and seeing her individually, that
nothing was really going to happen until she made something happen.
She felt a little alarmed at that and wondered whether I took
her out of the group on purpose in order to show her that there was
no hope for her outside of herself. I assured her, of course, that this
wasn't the case, but that there is indeed no hope for her unless she
moves from within.


For the rest of the interview I tried to push her more and more into
a discussion of her and me. At one point she said that I looked
something like a man she had recently seen in a film who was an
old letch. When I asked about sexual feelings she may have had
toward me, I received no leads. I then began asking her how she
wanted me to see her, how much she had to screen her statements
because of what she expected I would feel about them. She stated
that she only wanted me to know she was trying to get well. But
wasn't she nonetheless deceiving both of us, since she admitted
that she wasn't trying much of the time?


Only later on in the interview was she able to talk about wanting
to be a woman in front of me (as she sat there like a child), that she
wanted to appear attractive to me, yet nevertheless she wore these
dungarees today because she wasn't feeling well last night and
wanted to sleep on the bus. (She had a migraine headache last night,
the second migraine immediately prior to a visit with me). I was
quite rough with her today. For example, I made it clear that although
she says she wants to please me, she deliberately did something
designed to displease me, i.e., not bringing in the written
material. I again pointed out, and this time it finally seemed to take,
that there was something behind her not writing which was probably
connected to her feelings toward me; it was striking that at the same

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later when discussing her attractiveness as a woman, she expressed
some bad feelings about her body, especially about her elongated
labia, which makes her feel ugly and unlike a woman. I suspect this
is the analogue of men feeling they have penises which are small.
Since she has never, in fact, compared this area of her body with
anyone else's and secretly uses this to feed her negative image of
herself, I jestingly asked her who she's ever checked it out with.


Then I asked if she felt she was now pleasing me more. She said
that she was. I asked her when it began. She started to cry, uttering
through the tears that it was as though she had to talk about unpleasant
parts of herself to please me and herself. That wasn't the
way I felt and told her so. I am pleased when she is simply more honest
with her feelings and stops resisting and denying issues. It makes
little difference to me whether or not these are intrinsically unpleasant
or pleasant subjects as long as she's being honest. She seemed to
hear that, and we ended up on a closer and more harmonious note,
I think, though the hour was an unsettling one for her. I tried to reassure
her somewhat by reminding her that next Wednesday is the
day before Thanksgiving, but that I will be here if she is planning
to come. I guess what I was really saying is, "I do care about you and
I'll be here, even though it's practically a holiday."

AS I was coming up on the bus I said "unfocused" and that
became the cue word for the morning. Three-fourths of the session

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As for telling you that you looked like Don Lopez of <i>Tristana</i>,
I said that to Karl first as a kind of crack joke about you. Having
fun at your expense. But it really wasn't a bad thing in my eyes.
I would like to be able to induce such a dream where you could
take an active role.


I first started feeling real in the session when I said I felt sad
because I knew I was disappointing you. I never felt like I was
disappointing you in the group since I didn't think you were
expecting anything in particular. There were so many other mute
faces. You seemed more imaginary than you do now. Then I
started talking, saying things that could either be put in the
"sexual category" or the "bad things." But as I was saying them
I saw that I was bundled up inside this wrapping, these leggings,
this smile of a little girl. I think it's always when I feel this
presence inside me that I start to cry. I feel like I have to drag
this pitiful, but real, kid around in me. And the most important
question was when you asked me, "Do you think of yourself as a
woman?" I knew, "No, no." That's why there's always a certain
amount of gameiness and flirtation, but it is more me flirting
with a woman's identity. I can't really be violated. Not a woman
seduced by a man. The landlady and I in our fights are not two
women. It's a crank and a little girl who has done something
wrong and wants to get on the good side of life.


Then you said, "Have you pleased me?" I knew I had but
when we started analyzing it, that brought the other part of me
back, that unreal equal I feel I have to be. I just want to be
bundled up and rocked by you. I think I got off the track. That's
when I agreed with the categories. I hate to look back over my
shoulder like that and I always do. You ask for it. You prompt
me into analyzing sensations, whereas I just want to have them.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So then I said, "It will be so awful, the thoughts that will
come out." I didn't mean that I was trying to pacify and agree
with the sarcastic part. Actually I felt grateful. It didn't seem like
facts I was telling, just feelings.


I also felt a progression. Like I didn't want to start from nothing
next session. Didn't want to end the session, either.


That dream of the pulled flesh was one of the rare sexual
dreams where flesh is actually involved. The people around me
who were pulling my flesh down were doctors. I concentrated on
the session for the forty minutes after, when I sat on the grass
and wrote this. But after that I did practical things that I thought
might help me. I was aware of pleasurable thoughts this week,
moments with Karl that seemed real without tears. Also, I was
aware of that feeling that is not a feeling, but a suspension.
Like before I know I have to write and don't, before I know I
have to type this and don't, before I know I should be thinking
of this and don't. That a great part of my time is spent in holding
back. Just like I do in the session, an imperfect replica of life.

A FLUID and close encounter with Ginny today. It should have
been bad but I worked hard and well, and Ginny was willing to
stretch herself. A migraine headache, she says; it started yesterday.
Another one, I said. I think that's several occurring the day before
seeing me, and also those night panics the day before our sessions. I
inquire about this, gently of course. She plays dumb. I ask again,

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this point I am coyly inviting her to say something loving. She
can't. She says it reminds her of having given a gift to a teacher, but
you usually give a teacher a present only at the end of term, I become
braver and wonder aloud, "Isn't it possible to give a teacher a
gift because you like him?" At this point she makes the connection
and says disarmingly, "Well, you know I like you." I maintain my
composure: "You say that so easily now!" I remind her that she has
eschewed that admission ever since we have known each other.
Moreover, liking is not undimensional--liking me must have a considerable
number of facets, and yet she cannot express any of them.
She listens. She opens up a bit more and talks about how she liked
me last year when I was leading the group and how she would
silently cheer for me, if I were to say something that would help some
of the other patients, only this year it's different because she is the
patient and it's hard to be subject and observer at the same time.
Silence. I ask her where her thoughts are. She flits away and says
she had started to think about her old boyfriend, Pete. I let her go.


We talked about Pete and she tells me how he had just called her
minutes before Karl walked through the door, how she told Pete she
had to hang up and then felt guilty for it and called him back in
twenty minutes and was obsessed with all the bad things that she had
done. I went over each of the bad things, as I have in the past with

GINNY


THE THING about a migraine is you can't have anything ruffle
your balance. That is the posture I've taken in sessions. Inside
I think I want myself to be changed radically--no vestige or
shred or smile to remain. So when you try to salvage some of
my ways of doing things, showing they're not all bad, it's sort
of comforting. But the remnant doesn't mean too much. I feel
sarcastic about your praise.


When I used to be religious, God was a kind of catalyst between
me and my relations with the world. I would give up so
much for things to go good in the outside world. In this way I
bargained off years of life, said I wouldn't care if I never had a
boyfriend and never got married, so long as my parents would
stay alive. I, on my part, was never as good as I promised, but
in the sloppy interchange between me and God, things worked
out on His part, even though I fell short.

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I would do anything just to keep myself in a relationship. Even
though I might be totally camouflaged, so the other person
doesn't know I'm there.


That's what I do with you, I think. Try to measure up, but I
don't want to disturb you or myself. And I know I'm not supposed
to entertain you--so somewhere in between I sit. I am sort of
sustaining the exhibit, not smashing it or finishing it.


When I talked about Pete and you said, "Why do you have to
get to the bad side?" That's like saying that a person would be
pretty if her nose hadn't grown that extra inch. If I try deliberately
stopping after a single thought before it becomes fetid
and heavy, I'd be aware that I was doing it. Vicious circles are
my natural train of thought.


I know I want too much attention, undivided attention. But
just a physical proximity, not too much in-depth attention.


I am very on guard in session now. I know you want me to
probe my feelings toward you, and because they are not just
bubbling out of my mind and face, I feel silly digging for them.
I have always been honest, I thought, in saying what I am thinking,
but all I've really been is the top part of the flower, and never
crawled under the dirt and exposed roots. My sincerity is pretty
and probably superficial.


I feel in everything I must hold back, and when I do it, as
my emotions and me are receding from view (it inevitably leads
to that) I am the first to censure.


And there are so many words of censure, I watch my actions,
justify them. I see that I am not rewarded. And that is right.


These words don't pertain to any particular incident. They are
just a view that I am stuck with. It's why I sometimes can't
concentrate on particular incidents.


December 2


DR. YALOM


I FELT very alert, eager to see Ginny, eager to make contact with her
today. She came in and handed me what she had written from last

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The official start of the hour. A complaint. Things aren't good
with Karl, sexually. Then she combined this grievance with another
-- it had been like this ever since I had given her those pills. She
couldn't elaborate. I got the feeling that there was a not-so-hidden
accusation against me in her statement, but no further traces of that
were visible during the hour.


She had written well the day before: two good solid hours of work
producing ten pages, but then she felt so sloppy and bad inside the
rest of the day. I spent a while trying to investigate that statement,
wondering if we could rationally reexamine her feelings. She could
immediately see the fallacy of her value judgment. I asked her what
she meant by "sloppy?" My theory was that she at least spends the
rest of the day generating ideas for the next morning's writing, so
that anything she did the rest of the day could be construed as useful.
She wouldn't accept that, insisting that mornings and afternoons
are completely compartmentalized--nothing feeds into the morning
after except an occasional dream. Oh yes, there was a dream of a
big woman with big breasts and a big penis, she was lying on top
of this woman and that scared her a good bit. She mentioned the
dream a couple of times. She wanted to work on it, I didn't. If I fall
into Ginny's phantasmagorical dream world, I lose touch with the
flesh and blood person, and we both lose touch with what's happening
between the two of us, and it's on the thread of what's passing
between us that I think everything depends. So I didn't bite at the
dream-bait and instead returned to her feelings of sloppiness. From
there we went into an endless cycle of her feeling sad, of her feeling
that she lets everyone down, that nothing she has is worthwhile.
It soon became clear, as I have said to her many times before, that all
of her experiences are filtered through that background music of self-deprecation

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried another reasonable tact. How come, I wonder with her,
many people like you, many people find something of value in you?
Could it be that their judgment of you is better than yours? She
doesn't answer, but I know what she is thinking. "They don't really
know me; nobody can perceive the emptiness inside of me." She talks
of her inability to continue anything. For example, she went through
the motions of coming to the group, but was passive within it for a
whole year. She only pretends to live and to give. She does the same
with Karl. I wonder aloud why Karl chooses to spend his life with
her. She undercuts herself again by claiming that she puts on a show
for him.


Then I give her the loaded question. "Why do I see you? Why do
I continue to see you?" She seems flustered and says she doesn't
know, and is near tears. She talks about not being able to give me
anything, that she desperately wants to be able to walk out of here
improved, no longer desperate and hopeless. She doesn't know how
to do it. I want to say to her that obviously I'm continuing to see
her because I see something of value in her. I don't say that explicitly
but it comes out implicitly. She says she can't even look at
me. I ask her to look at me and she does and suddenly I become
aware of the fact that she hasn't really looked at me for any length
of time before. So we look at each other's eyes for awhile in the
session today.


She says she suddenly feels dizzy and nauseated and very tense and
then begins to weep. I try to find out what's behind the weeping. She
can say only that she doesn't deserve to get any kind of warmth from
me, and yet feels herself on the edge of receiving this warmth. She
must do something first to deserve it. What has she got to give me? If
I wanted her to clean up my office, she'd do it. (I recall how eagerly
she told me about a series of novels written by Anthony Powell, an
English writer, and how timidly she tried to suggest that I, she is sure,
would enjoy these.) I commented again on her feelings of blackness
and unworthiness. I label it a myth and wonder where the myth arose.
She says it's not so much blackness or evil as emptiness. I tell her that
she can't even look in my eyes without being filled with feeling, so
that emptiness too is a myth. I hope that's true. Perhaps I'm not giving

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Toward the end of the hour she feels the onset of a migraine. She
states she was so proud of not having a headache before coming to
see me this week, but the danger period is not over. I spend the last
three minutes giving her some relaxation procedures, starting from
the toes up, with the major suggestion that her eyeballs sink back
into her head, since she complains that they are practically bulging
out of her skull. The relaxation exercises seem to be helpful.
Ginny leaves feeling much better, and, ironically, it has stopped
raining. Water had been flowing for much of the hour on both sides

fattening and is suddenly filled up. Maybe that's true. I think of

GINNY


WHEN I came in after a week that was fecund in the wrong
direction I didn't expect anything, probably just to confess that
much.


When I first started crying it was out of tension and frustration.
But for once it didn't stay there. It didn't even jump immediately
to release, as it sometimes does. Yesterday you broke

Things seemed to change. I took new steps. I had been refusing
to answer your repeated question, "What do I mean to you?"
because I could only have answered with words. Because I insisted
on limiting myself to words. Kind of like a short-answer
quiz.


Even at the end when you told me to close my eyes and relax,
other times I would have been impatient that time was going by,
and that it wouldn't work. But something was happening. I didn't
get a migraine, then or all day.


When I went to leave and the sun really had broken through,
as though we were in a Hollywood psychological thriller, I said
"Well, it will rain again." A soggy answer, I realized, a flip
answer, but I didn't have to flaggelate myself for having given
the wrong answer and failed somehow. I took it for the sarcastic
habit it is. But because I felt different inside, I could quiet the
mumbling. I didn't feel like a warehouse of echoes as I usually
do.


All through the session it seemed I was trying to go back on
my old track, to involve us in the old habits of dangling sentences.
And you kept bringing me back.


Also, I was mostly aware, except at the end, that it's just me
there and you. Not worrying that what I was doing would detract
from other people--Karl, my parents, my friends.


When I felt dizzy and nauseous I tolerated it. I didn't immediately
think of drinking three glasses of warm salted water
and making myself vomit with my thumb. I try to feel some of
the sensation on the other side of the nausea which is not mere
fear, but actually pleasurable feelings.


I feel a little dizzy, aware now when I talk to people, how I
do not make contact. With everyone I probably don't have to go
through a procedure like yesterday's, but I wonder why with some
people I choose to hide.


When you said I was tingling with emotions, flooded with
them, it was so nice. The rest of the day I was aware of more
feeling and sadnesses. But things were easier. I was not plugged

DR. YALOM


GINNY ebullient today. She used that word to describe something
she wrote--a word I haven't used for years--it was right for her
today. She was high-spirited, optimistic, somehow changed by last
week's session. She came in saying she really wished we weren't
meeting for a few more days because she is not "ready." That meant
that she had such high hopes for today's session, but didn't see
how she could get herself into the proper frame. She wasn't sure
that she could do it today. I had to ask her what "it" was. So much
has been happening to me this week, the last meeting was still a
little sketchy. However, within a minute or two it suddenly burst
into my mind, and I remembered everything that had happened.
She said "it" was expressing her feelings clearly. Unimaginatively but
doggedly I suggested that "it" was especially expressing feelings to
me and about me.


She said her reason for not being ready was that she had had to
prepare a surprise birthday party for Karl, which used up a lot of
energy. That explanation made me more convinced than ever that, at
some level, she was pitting me against Karl, that she could give
only to either him or me. It was as though she had only a permanently
limited supply of love and affection and what she gave to
one was taken from the other. When I expressed this to her, she
remarked that when she came back from last week's session, she told
Karl that I had said she was tingling with feeling. He scoffed at
that and hugged her in a playful, mocking fashion. That was a
curious business because I don't think I used the word "tingling"--
it's not one of my words. She, too, was a bit confused and then
changed the subject to sex and her present inability to have an

Did I enter into her sexual life in some way? She replied she had
been so optimistic the day after our last session, but the feeling had
gradually disappeared and she had a migraine the following evening.
I commented on her end-run around my question and repeated it.
She then told me a recent dream in which she and Mr. Light were
looking at each other for a long period of time. Mr. Light was a former
teacher who had encouraged her writing and had apparently fallen in
love with her. At their very last meeting he had put his hand under
her tiny brassiere. A month later he visited her and her family and
she spent a day with him at the beach, but had not made love with
him, mainly because of lack of a suitable opportunity. Later he wrote
her that he had been considering leaving his wife for her. I asked for
associations to Mr. Light and she produced only, "I'll show you the
light." I thought it was clear that Mr. Light in some way represented
me--not only in my showing her the light but also in the fact that
she and I had looked into each other's eyes last session much more
than before. She then recalled another dream fragment of a rough
cowboy, not Karl, but a boyfriend who reminds her of Karl, pulling
her by the arms to get her away. She was obviously embarrassed while
telling this story about Mr. Light and I asked her why. She said it
was because she was handling something that was once very
serious in a flippant, light-hearted way. My suspicion was that she
was embarrassed because she was indirectly talking about me. I
asked her whether or not the relaxation exercise I gave her at the
end of the session was a type of sexual experience. She said it wasn't,
but that it really made her feel good and she was glad for it. After

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I pursued Mr. Light and asked her whether the idea of my leaving
my wife had occurred to her. She said that she has seen my wife and
that my wife appeared not too unlike herself, only a more integrated
woman. My wife and I seem right for each other and she suspects a
separation would not be likely. Mr. Light's wife, however, was a
different kind of woman, fat and unintellectual, so that Ginny
represented something really different to him.


I remarked that I was saying many unusual things today. She
wondered whether they were genuine--or was I just testing her in
some fashion? I told her the truth--I was saying things in a much
more uncensored fashion than is usual for me. I could say almost the
first thing that came to my mind, such as the questions about how I
fit into her sexual life and what she thinks of me and my wife, because
I felt her to be much more open and receptive and unafraid
to look at me. (We did continue today to look at each other far more
than we have in the past.)


During the session she recited a few lines of her poetry, especially
from a satirical poem written in response to a speech by a woman's
liberationist. I was much amused by some of the clever lines, e.g., "Do
you want us to walk with breasts unfurled?" But then she began to
chastise herself for having written this, calling it small and frivolous.
I asked her if there's not a more generous descriptive word
and she used ironic or witty. Irony comes hard for her; she finds it
almost impossible to express feelings of disagreement or anger without
subsequent self-castigation. She thinks she doesn't have the right
to criticize; in fact she doesn't allow herself any rights at all, and
that's still a big part of her being a little girl and having to keep
the lid on any part of her not inconsiderable reservoir of anger.


She left the session, I think, somewhat disappointed because of
unrealistically high expectations. Toward the end of the hour I felt a
different kind of feeling settling in, and my hunch is that the high
optimism will be dampened and she will be somewhat depressed as
she recognizes some of her unrealistic feelings about me. That's not
to say that I don't feel good about Ginny and that we aren't moving

December 9


GINNY


I THINK I was trying to entertain you. I wanted to go deeper than
last week but when I came in I didn't feel in the mood. I just
wanted to enjoy us.


All of last week didn't wear off, however, since I was more
aware of you-me looking, at least. I pulled myself in that
direction.


If you had scolded or said "What's this game you're playing
this week?" I would have changed. Instead you didn't seem to
mind (that I was a waitress and you were a client).


We did a good job of analyzing someone whose motives were
there but not emotions.


I don't feel bad. I told most everything that happened to me
that was important, but without a compelling center of a need
to change.


I didn't see any of the parallels with Mr. Light until you made
me see them. In a way that dream was showing and experiencing
the meaningfulness and pleasure in my small relationship with
him, and my telling it to you emphasized the absurd side. Maybe
I told you the dream to show you the absurd ironic side to my
looking you in the eyes. To put the last session in its ridiculous
perspective (with the cement of sarcasm).


Actually the session was me in the purest, as I am every day.
All the things I want to change. The sarcastic, giddy, anecdotal
time-passing images. I feel angry in perspective that I carried
on and enjoyed so this superficial side. The revenge is there's
nothing to write in this write-up because there were no revelations.
