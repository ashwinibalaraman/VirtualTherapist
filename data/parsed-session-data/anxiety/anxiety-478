<b>DR:</b> So let's see, we had our last session on August 28th, right?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> And at that time, so that's pretty much close to your month now.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.
<b>DR:</b> I've been treating you for major depression. And according to your last visit you are on Celexa 20 in the morning.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Adderall 10 mg twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Where are you on the Lamictal now? How many mg are you taking, because last visit you were on 3 in the morning and 3 at night?
<b>PT:</b> That's where I'm at.
<b>DR:</b> You're still there?
<b>PT:</b> I'm still there.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] is 20 in the morning and 60 at bedtime.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, [INAUDIBLE] 7.5 mg twice a day or [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> I'm on, yes, 1, 7.5 mg twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Correct. And the [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE] 20 mg at bedtime?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 1 tab a.m. of 20 mg.
<b>DR:</b> No, [INAUDIBLE], OX.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yes, 2 at bedtime.
<b>DR:</b> And you are seeing [NAME OTHER] how frequently?
<b>PT:</b> Once a week.
<b>DR:</b> Once a week. Tell me about your depression now. How do you rate your dep, you are on a whole bunch of medication. Tell me how do you rate your depression at this time?
<b>PT:</b> Well, most of the day up to the evening I would say that I'm, you mean from 1 to 10?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I would say 9. It's just been great.
<b>DR:</b> Ten being no depression?
<b>PT:</b> No depression.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause I usually say 10 means worst depression, but you said nine, I was oh my god that's pretty bad, so 1 in your book is the worst depression you ever had?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And 10 being no depression and that's why you are at 9.
<b>PT:</b> During the day.
<b>DR:</b> During the day. How about nighttime, what happens?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I become depressed and anxious, um, shortness of breath, um, it's not real, it's not, it seems to be getting better though. I'm not as depressed. I'm just, I'm tired. I'm just tired.
<b>DR:</b> Are you driving yourself now?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. I can drive.
<b>DR:</b> How scary it is to drive?
<b>PT:</b> It's not.
<b>DR:</b> In terms of anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> It's not. I can drive.
<b>DR:</b> And when was the last time you seriously thought about killing yourself?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, it's been, well, I've never, I mean, I've thought that I wanted to kill myself, it's just that I wanted to die.
<b>DR:</b> That's how you landed in the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When you came in and that was your last hospital admission was, you have been in [INAUDIBLE] on July '07. And then that's when you were discharged. And you went to day treatment July as well. So you have 1 hospital admission since I saw you.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.
<b>DR:</b> And I first saw you July, so that's essentially when you landed in the hospital.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, that sounds about right.
<b>DR:</b> And, um, how is it going on with [NAME OTHER]?
<b>PT:</b> Good. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you like her?
<b>PT:</b> I like her a lot. I feel real comfortable and she listens. And she gives advice when I need it. I've only seen her, I think, a couple times though, so I can't really.
<b>DR:</b> How is home front?
<b>PT:</b> Home front's good. I mean, it's perfect really. I mean, I'm not exaggerating. I've got a great husband, a great son, and we live in a beautiful home and, um, I don't work, so I'm able to do things all day long when I want and how I want.
<b>DR:</b> Staying at home.
<b>PT:</b> I stay at home.
<b>DR:</b> Why do you not get out in the middle of the day to do something for [PATIENT NAME] when you are not the mom or the wife?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I did go to AA 3 times a week.
<b>DR:</b> When was the last time you had an alcoholic drink?
<b>PT:</b> Six months ago.
<b>DR:</b> So you're maintaining the AA.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That's good. But that's again part of treatment. I'm talking about [PATIENT NAME] going out for fun.
<b>PT:</b> For fun.
<b>DR:</b> Window shopping or going to see a friend or.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I go, I am able now to go to the store.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  So you're not panicked anymore.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not panicking anymore. And I went to the mall.
<b>DR:</b> By yourself?
<b>PT:</b> Myself. Bought some clothes. I have lunch with a friend about twice a week after AA meetings. And she's now teaching me how to, um, make a quilt. 
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I'm able to concentrate and have the enthusiasm to do that.
<b>DR:</b> By what, yknow, I can see that you have more makeup and more jewelry than I saw you before. But the facial expression is still not happy.
<b>PT:</b> I still don't look happy.
<b>DR:</b> What you are describing is very exciting. Two months ago when I saw you, when you saw me first time I told you,  oh my god, what am I going to do for her? She looks so bad. You are feeling good.
<b>PT:</b> You were right.
<b>DR:</b> I was very worried. You knew that. I didn't hide it. But the thing is that what you are describing very exciting, in 2 months you've made a big progress. However, 2 things I am not liking.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> One, your medication is just too long. Number 2, what you're saying, your face is not expressing that. I don't see you smiling, your eyes are -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] all about. Yeah, I'm looking at you. If you want me to stop, I can stop.
<b>PT:</b> That's okay.
<b>DR:</b> That's why your name was mentioned only 1 time for my [INAUDIBLE] because I have to call my colleague over the whole session in August [INAUDIBLE]. I'm intentionally avoiding it because what they get is female voice and me. They know that I'm recording.
<b>PT:</b> I understand, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But your face is not brightening up. Your eyes are not glittering up that I have a perfect life you just said. And I want to know why.
<b>PT:</b> I guess I just, I just don't know who I am anymore.
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean by that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was telling my psychologist, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], that I've had, I saw this movie and it was about this lady that, and this man that were walking in Central Park and they were happy and getting ready to get married and they were mugged. And her soon to be fiancé€€ died - 
<b>DR:</b> Husband.
<b>PT:</b> Husband died because.
<b>DR:</b> How? They were mugged.
<b>PT:</b> They were mugged. So it was immediately she changed and who she used to be was a stranger and then she went on through the movie - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Won't go any further from that, to this different person. And then I'm thinking after the movie then I'm thinking, my god, yknow, I've been through probably 100 different strangers in my life. 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I ought to be, yknow, schizophrenic. 
<b>DR:</b> I told you that you are not schizophrenic. But you are on some medications typically for depression we use antidepressants. But I struggle with the depression, which I did with you, I have used antidepressant, I have used psychostimulants, like you are on [INAUDIBLE]. I have used antipsychotic medication because you have paranoia, you are not getting out of the house. And I feel that only antidepressant was not going to hold your depression so I added a mood stabilizer. One can look at the medicine, I said, oh my god, look at the medicine, and I'm telling myself too, oh my god, look at the medicine, but that is the only way I can keep you out of the hospital. And I was really concerned as bad as you looked. And you are a totally new person to me. I have not known you for months or years. I have known you only 3, 2 months.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> If I had the options available I [INAUDIBLE] option [INAUDIBLE]. Because I couldn't erase that. I alternated that with chemicals that can be done. But I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling better. The story you've just said this lady's life changed from being very good to very bad. Is that what happened to you or it happened in the reverse order?
<b>PT:</b> It was like she changed and.
<b>DR:</b> From good to bad.
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, it was bad, but it was the course that she had to take from the change. The course she had to take. And with me with hundreds of things that I did those things became strangers. I've, I am so many people. I'm so many, I've changed so much from my experiences.
<b>DR:</b> For good or for bad?
<b>PT:</b> Good, that's what's so unreal for me because I feel good. I feel that I'm a good person and I have friends that say the same thing and people that say what a nice person I am, and I want to be good. I mean, that's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> But is there a doubt in your mind that you are a bad person? 
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And that's why you are being punished to have a disease like this?
<b>PT:</b> No, I feel like it's, I feel like I'm manipulating people to think that I'm a good person.
<b>DR:</b> What gave you that idea?
<b>PT:</b> Because of all things I let myself get into or have been done to by people in the past I can't seem to grasp that I am a good person that I perceive, that other people perceive me as. 
<b>DR:</b> You couldn't imagine that you could be only victim.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That there was something more to it that might have been because you are "not a good person?"
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I never had any doubt in my mind that you're a good person. The doubt that I had in me when I saw you first was the complex problem that you presented to me. I had my doubts. What am I going to do with you. And I'm sharing with you now as much details because I am obligated to let my patients know what I am thinking and what I'm doing.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Decisions like that. How we reason, but I cannot tell my patients everything on session 1. That's a judgment call I have to make, is my patient ready to hear what I'm going to tell him or her. If I believe that he or she is ready I tell them on the first session how much I can do, how much I cannot do.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not.
<b>DR:</b> I make a judgment that, oh my god, he or she is very vulnerable, I said no, I have to go in there. That's what the profession is all about, making the judgment.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, I'm just scared and I'm real vulnerable like you said. I mean.
<b>DR:</b> You were much more vulnerable there, but I told you all this time, sometime I feel that you realized that I was struggling.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I knew you were. I'm used to doctors struggling with me because I've not been a - 
<b>DR:</b> But I also told you that if I reach a point when I think that I have done everything I can do, there is nothing more I can offer, I'll tell you up front that, ma'am, go to somebody else. I have done everything I can. But I'm very proud of you throughout this.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> You have done well. I cannot believe you're driving. I cannot believe you have been shopping. Six or 8 weeks ago this was not [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> It was, I didn't think it was going to happen.
<b>DR:</b> I didn't think it was possible either. But we have to do something. This is not like taking out your appendix and you cannot have another attack. Unfortunately this is disease is a very recurrent disease. So we cannot let our guards down. I'm not saying that you will become sick. I'm saying when the disease is going to attack again is anybody's guess.
<b>PT:</b> That's why I'm really scared every morning when I wake up.
<b>DR:</b> But you also have to understand that they have to go through the guard yet, with us standing as a guard.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sorry. What did you?
<b>DR:</b> I said the disease has to go through the gate before it reaches you but I'm standing as a guard as a psychiatrist that's my job.
<b>PT:</b> I understand, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. But on the same token, your medications are too complicated. We need to cut something [INAUDIBLE]. I'm not telling you that I'm going to take away everything, but as many medications you are on, keep it in mind this cannot be because it should now be maintenance medicine that you are on 6 or 7 of. It was more of a acute intervention. How can I make a quick turnaround? But now that you are doing better, I'm not going to make any changes without your knowledge.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Anything I do change, I'll tell you, ma'am, this is what I'm proposing, this is why I'm doing it, these are the benefits and [INAUDIBLE] might be there. The ultimate goal is to keep you functional but reduce the medication. Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. What do you?
<b>DR:</b> I'm not [INAUDIBLE]. As I said, I'm hearing what you're saying, but your face is not giving me the message.
<b>PT:</b> I'm nervous when I'm around you.
<b>DR:</b> You are smiling and you are saying you are nervous? How is that together? Am I going to kill you or what?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know. 
<b>DR:</b> Um, do you have enough medications at home?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> For now I'll leave it like that. This fear factor will possibly will be much [INAUDIBLE] addressing it with [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> This fear was crippling to you to the extent that you couldn't get out of the house. So you are still somewhat scared of me, I am not taking it as a negative term. I'm not getting offended. All I'm suggesting is can very well be part of the illness.
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> And [NAME OTHER], by psychotherapy can help you much, much more in this area than with the medication. So keep appointments with her and talk to her about this including the fact that you're still kind of scared of me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Talk to her about it, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We have known each other, me and [NAME OTHER], for long time, so she will tell good, bad, and ugly of anything about me. I'm not making any changes in the medicine today. 
<b>PT:</b> What would you most likely change?
<b>DR:</b> My first target will be Adderall.
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> The reason behind is if all these medication, any one of them can [INAUDIBLE] make your anxiety worse, it's Adderall.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> I had to use it because of the severity of the depression. But I also have you use [INAUDIBLE] to control the anxiety. Kind of creating the fire and damping it down, it's kind of maintaining the balance. But that can be a huge tragedy move, cannot be a long term. So 1 of these days when you feel that your depression is really, really under control, I'll cut down on the Adderall to once a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then see how we do. Then we'll take out another 1 if you do better. I will not, I will not, I'm telling you again, yank these medication out of you. I'm not, and I'm not going to make any changes without your knowledge.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm really scared.
<b>DR:</b> I know. Fear has been a factor and that's why I said talk to [NAME OTHER] about this.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, this is the same fear that was keeping you in the house. This is the same fear that will not let you go to the grocery store to shop. This is the same fear that will not let you drive. You're doing that. So you are getting better. Have the confidence that, yes, I can do it. It might take some time. But I can do it. Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm realizing it's going to take a, probably a lifetime.
<b>DR:</b> I don't know about that, but it will take some time. All right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'll see you in about 4 weeks, ma'am.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And talk to [NAME OTHER] about these issues. When she looks at my note from today it will be reflected there and ask her to look at my note so she knows what we talked about today.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> And thank you for letting me record this session.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Take care, uh-huh, bye-bye.
<b>PT:</b> Bye-bye.
