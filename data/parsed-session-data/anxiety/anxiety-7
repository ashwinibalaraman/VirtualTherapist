
In 1971, Bell &amp; Howell, having suffered financial losses in some of
their product lines, closed my office as an economy measure. I was on my
own, eased out by a generous severance package. I started to edit a book on
encounter groups with Larry Solomon and I stepped up my workshop schedule.
I was living in the first house I'd ever owned, a tiny two-bedroom aerie
high in the Hollywood Hills above the Sunset Strip. Because the house was
on stilts, I enjoyed a thrilling view from downtown to the ocean. It was not
so thrilling on February 9, however, when everything at 8560 Hollywood
Boulevard began to shimmy and shake.


The house rocked and rolled, the glassware fell out of the cabinets, the
pictures slid off the walls, the furniture skidded across the floor, and light
fixtures came crashing down from the ceiling. Through the rattling windows
I could see transformers all over the city exploding in brilliant blue arcs. I
was frozen with fright and sure the house would topple over and end up in
the street below. I was certainly going to die.


The 6.6 earthquake and the aftershocks continued into the next day, but
the house didn't fall down. There is something about being betrayed by the
ground underneath you that feels like the ultimate treachery. It took weeks
to regain my equilibrium. I was reassured by the former owner and builder of
the house, who sent me detailed drawings of how the house was supported—
sixteen steel and concrete columns set ten feet into bedrock. The house was
designed to swing and sway in an earthquake but not fall down. For the
next twelve years that little hill house was my home. After the next major
quake in 1994, when I no longer lived there, I took the drawings to the
occupant of 8560 Hollywood Boulevard, who was as grateful as I had been
to receive them.


"Why bother?" Roberto demanded. Roberto was my buddy, my mainstay,
as I explored the possibilities for meeting other lesbians. Roberto accompanied

[p. <i>167</i>]

"What is it with you? Do you want to be a lesbian or don't you?" he
asked.


"Of course I want to be—I am a lesbian."


"Then why don't you act like one. Women here are cruising you, but
you just look away!"


I didn't understand it any more than he did. I just couldn't get comfortable
in this environment. I said, "I never went to bars to meet men when
I was being heterosexual. It doesn't feel anymore right to go to a bar to meet
a woman."


"Bullshit! I don't think that's the problem at all. You had a relationship
behind closed doors with someone who didn't even think of herself as lesbian.
You didn't have to be gay in life. Now you do, that's what you're so
scared about, really being a lesbian."


He was right, of course. The problem was that the many years of defining
my attraction to women as dangerous ground had taken their toll. I had
trained myself to turn off to women I was attracted to. In these bars I felt
drawn to practically everybody, but I could not overcome the anxiety I felt
about sexual feelings toward women. I just shut down to be safe, and so far
I'd not found a way to retrieve myself from this limbo. Bars seemed not to
be the answer.


Why didn't gay people have a variety of places to meet and socialize just
as straight people did? It seemed unfair that gays had only bars to go to. I
felt irritated about being told, in essence, that my access to other gays could
only happen where straight society decided it was all right. Maybe it was
time to change all this. I had, after all, brought hundreds of straights together
in my Quest for Love workshops. Why not do the same for gays? Would
they come? I'd heard that homosexuals had put on a parade the previous
summer, walking right down the middle of Hollywood Boulevard carrying
signs saying they were gay and proud. Wouldn't that mean there were some
who would come to a gay growth center? I started talking to people about it.


A psychologist friend referred me to a community psychiatrist at UCLA,
Martin Field, who was meeting with a group of gay activists who wanted to
open a gay social services center. I discovered that, yes, Dr. Field was consulting
with such a group, and yes, he would be glad to introduce me to
them. He would bring them over to my house.

[p. <i>168</i>]

<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000005176-I0017&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

1971, after I moved to Los Angeles to explore being gay an odd little group came to
me to talk about opening a community center for gays. They met in my living room
over the summer. In October the Gay Community Services Center opened,
the first of its kind anywhere.


I had never met an activist before. Now I wondered what I was getting
into. Images of bomb-throwing Bolsheviks came to mind. "That's stupid,"
I told myself, "middle-class paranoia working overtime! UCLA psychiatrists
didn't consult with bomb-throwing Bolsheviks." On July 7, 1971, I opened
the door of my home to an oddly assorted little band of people who would
enter my life and change its direction forever.


They trooped in single file, looking about as apprehensive of me as I was
of them. First came Don Kilhefner in workshirt, construction boots, scraggly
beard, long hair, glasses. John Platania was a sight to behold; his oversized
red Afro framed his face like a halo. He glided in, shimmering white shirt
and harem trousers flowing gently around him. June Herrle was a rather
ordinary-looking young woman, jeans and T-shirt. Jim Kepner, older, unsmiling,
with eyes that looked as though they had already seen too much.

[p. <i>169</i>]

As though it was the expected thing, Morris spoke first. "Now, my dear
Miss Berzon ...," he began and proceeded to deliver a flowery oration that
included the history of gay liberation, how it related to the struggles of other
oppressed groups in the world, why the planet was in dire peril, and what
we all needed to do about it. His presentation was eloquent, and I was enchanted.
As he wound down, he finally began to talk about the plans his
group had for a gay community center.


At this point others began to chime in. June, who was a social worker,
saw the center as a place where gays could get counseling and other social
services. The men were particularly interested in assisting gay males who
had been arrested for "sexual misconduct," given that such arrests in those
days often involved police entrapment. Their plan was to intervene on behalf
of the accused in court and to make their own "rehabilitation programs"
available to ease the conditions of probation. Educating heterosexuals in the
helping professions was of interest to all of them. And there were other legal,
medical, personal-growth, and cultural programs they had ideas about. In
their enthusiasm, they talked over and around one another.


I was amazed at the scope of their vision and the grandiosity of their
plans. Kilhefner and Kight were quite sure they could raise money among
wealthy homosexuals and get funding for their project from a variety of
government agencies and private foundations. As I listened I thought how
incredibly naive they seemed. What government official would stick out a
civil-service neck to fund a homosexual organization? What wealthy gay person
would risk exposure by becoming involved with this maverick group?
Didn't they understand how powerless they were, how innocent, how vulnerable?
I feared for their safety and their sanity in undertaking this project.
Nevertheless, I offered to help them by designing a growth-group program
and by training peer counselors to run the groups. They were delighted.


In the months ahead, I met often with these people, and it was I who
got quite an education. I came to see that they were neither powerless, naive,
nor innocent. In fact, they were incredibly resourceful, persistent, and clever,
as practical in their strategies as they were passionate in their advocacy. Tradition,
convention, the law itself were up for grabs as these people plowed
past obstacles to achieve the impossible—establishment of the first community
center and social service agency designed to meet the needs of homosexual

[p. <i>170</i>]

I watched in amazement as Kilhefner, Kight, and company pressed on in
the face of unabashed hostility from bureaucrats, law enforcement, and social
service agencies. They used guerilla tactics to get around regulations they
couldn't possibly comply with. They scrounged equipment and furniture
they couldn't possibly buy. By some miracle, or so it seemed to me, they
pirated a telephone system, rented a building, got permits, and set up their
operation. Their schemes were brilliant and outrageous and they worked. I
was in awe of their chutzpah and their unflagging commitment. They simply
did not take no for an answer, from anyone, about anything.


On the afternoon of October 16, 1971, I stood on the sidewalk and looked
at the ten-room, falling-down wreck of a Victorian mansion on Wilshire
Boulevard with the sign right out front for all the world to see: GAY COMMUNITY
SERVICES CENTER. Never before had there been such a sign or
such a place. I felt proud to have had something to do with this extraordinary
venture.


On October 16, the Center's first day of life, people streamed through the
building, most looking as astonished as I felt. There were members of the
Los Angeles City Council, the few movers and shakers of the nascent gay
rights movement, the Center's small board of directors, volunteers, friends
of the founders, and the press. Over the next two years, many thousands of
people would use the Center's counseling and consciousness-raising groups,
housing, employment, legal aid, probation and parole services, and medical
and STD clinics. As planned, volunteer lawyers, physicians, and nurses participated
in the programs, but I had insisted that the counseling program
be run on a peer-counselor basis. For the next four years I trained dozens
of nonprofessionals to run various kinds of growth groups at the Center.


Deciding to get involved with the formation of the Gay and Lesbian Community
Services Center (as it was subsequently called) was one of the best
things I ever did for myself. In that first year I spent hours in conversation
with Don Kilhefner and Morris Kight, both dedicated activists with long
experience on the front lines of civil rights movements. They understood
how anger and advocacy interacted, fed off one another, and created opportunities
for unprecedented change. Through Kilhefner and Kight I was able
to achieve a clarity about what it means to be gay that I'd never had. I came
to see that we were a community just forming, a powerful force just barely
beginning to stir itself. For the first time in my life I was having positive

[p. <i>171</i>]

In the early 1970s I began doing speaking engagements for the Center,
talking about what homosexuality means, who gay people are, and the Center's
mission. I grew close to many of the young people in my training classes,
and I always took three or four of them with me whenever I spoke publicly.
They talked about their gay lives while I talked about homosexuality in the
abstract. It took about six months for them finally to confront me.


"Do you realize that when anyone in the audience asks if you are gay,
you have a five, a ten, and a fifteen minute answer in none of which you
say you are gay?"


"I don't think so. I always say I'm gay."


In chorus they shouted at me, "Never! You never say you're gay!"


I was flabbergasted. I protested, but my young friends would not let me
get away with that denial. The next few speaking engagements, when the
question was inevitably asked, "Are you gay?" they would lean forward in
unison and scrutinize me. I couldn't get the words out fast enough. "Yes,
I <i>am</i> gay." It became clear that the coming out process is never over. There
are always new disclosure challenges, and young activists then, as now, did
not hesitate to hold one's feet to the fire. So, I trained them and they trained
me. We were mutually transforming ourselves.


September 1971. One of the things I was looking forward to at the annual
meetings of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C.,
was getting together with a San Francisco psychologist I had become acquainted
with by telephone but whom I had never met. His name was Don
Clark, and he initially contacted me because he was writing a report on
the Human Potential Movement for the Carnegie Foundation. It was soon
revealed in our conversations that we were both just coming out as gay. Don
was still married and living with his wife and children, but he had already
begun to speak publicly as a gay man and was writing a book, <i>Loving Someone
Gay</i>.


When we met, it turned out that Don felt as I did, that we should try to
do something to raise consciousness about being gay within the profession
of psychology. We could start right there at APA. Why not simply call a
meeting of the gay and lesbian psychologists attending the convention? We
looked at each other and laughed. In 1971, who was going to admit to being
a gay psychologist by coming to such a meeting? No one, that's who.


"Let's do it anyway," Don said. "What is there to lose?"

[p. <i>172</i>]

I agreed. We both felt secure enough with our own professional status,
and we were both convinced that the time had come for pushing a little
further out of the closet. We decided to publicize our improbable event by
putting up signs around the half-dozen APA convention hotels. We went
from floor to floor in our hotel stealing laundry bags from the housekeeping
carts. Using magic markers to make our signs, we announced:


"Meeting of Gay and Lesbian Members of APA in Room 615, Washington
Hilton, Friday at 6:00 P.M."


Like thieves in the night, we went stealthily from hotel to hotel, looking
over our shoulders each time we hurriedly attached a laundry bag to a corridor
wall. When it was over, we felt exhilarated.


On Friday afternoon at 5:30 Don and I met in my room. We sat stiffly
on one of the twin beds, nervously eyeing the door.


"What do you think will happen?" Don asked.


"Nothing, I imagine," I said. "We'll just sit here like fools and nobody
will come and then we'll go out to dinner and comfort each other for being
so silly as to think we could do this."


"Right," he said. "You're probably right."


At exactly six o'clock there was a knock on the door. Don and I looked
at each other. For a moment I thought neither of us was going to answer
it. Then Don walked slowly to the door and opened it. Two people stood
outside, a man and a woman.


"Come in," Don said.


They came in, looking around cautiously. We introduced ourselves. Another
knock at the door, then another, and another. Within fifteen minutes
there were twenty-five people in the room. Several were psychologists I
knew, and we greeted each other with sly smiles.


After a while, I stood up on a chair and got everyone's attention. The
first meeting ever of gay and lesbian psychologists was underway. I will never
forget the sight of that crowd, lying across beds, sitting on the floor, leaning
against the wall, every inch of space taken, men and women courageous
enough, or maybe just ready enough, to risk exposure that could be professionally
damaging to assert their need to be known for who they really were.


We discussed ways of exchanging experiences on what it was like to be
a gay professional in the university, social service agency, or clinical practice.
We brainstormed gay-themed research projects that might get funded by
private foundations. It was wonderfully exciting to be speaking this way, as
though doing so was a bold step into the open. After several hours, we

[p. <i>173</i>]

The convention ended and we returned to our workplaces. The exhilaration
of the evening soon faded into memory. We had purposely not taken
people's names and addresses because we didn't want them to feel threatened.
What a stupid mistake! We realized later that we had allowed our
own homophobia to deprive us of an opportunity for staying in touch with
everyone. How dumb we were, how co-opted by rules designed to keep us
isolated from one another! A few people wrote to us, but not enough to
think of organizing something for next year's convention. As it happened,
the following year both Don and I attended the Association for Humanistic
Psychology meetings in Squaw Valley rather than the APA convention.


At the 1972 APA meetings—I like to think it was because of the seeds we
had sown—a group of gay and lesbian psychologists protested an APA panel
on homosexuality consisting entirely of heterosexuals. The chairperson of
the panel had announced that there were no gay psychologists on the panel
because he had no knowledge of any admittedly gay psychologists within
APA and he was not willing to request that any psychologist jeopardize his
or her career by appearing as a homosexual. That did it. A core group of
five young gay psychologists met that evening and out of their rage at what
had happened in the afternoon symposium formulated the idea for the Association
of Gay Psychologists.


In 1973, the American Psychological Association sponsored their first formal
symposium on homosexuality in which the panel was made up <i>entirely</i>
of openly gay and lesbian psychologists. Was anyone interested in what they
had to say? Four hundred people attended the session. The conspiracy of
silence around gays and lesbians in the APA was broken forever.


January 1972. Don Clark and I have put together a panel for the California
State Psychological Association annual meeting, the first openly gay panel
ever to present at a psychological convention. As Don and I approached the

[p. <i>174</i>]

We pushed our way through the crowd at the door. Inside, it was wall-to-wall
people, many more than the room was meant to hold, and they were
three deep in the doorway. We made our way to the front. People were
sitting on the floor all around the podium. A row of tape recorders faced
us on the table. Our fellow panelists were already seated, looking wide-eyed
as even more people pushed their way into the crowded room.


At exactly two o'clock, Don stood and began to speak. One by one, we
talked about the experience of being gay and of working professionally with
gay men and women. After each panel member spoke, there was prolonged
applause, as though the audience was applauding not just the presentation
but the fact of our being there at all. When it was over, many people crowded
around us, saying things that made me feel gratified that we had done this.


"I'm gay and I never imagined I would attend a symposium like this."


"I'm gay and I've never told that to a stranger before."


"I'm gay and I feel okay about it for the first time ever today."


The year 1973 was a banner year for confrontation between gay activists
and the mental health establishment. A particularly aggressive group of East
Coast gays worked long and hard lobbying the leadership of the American
Psychiatric Association to drop homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses.
Their names should be prominent in any roll call of heroes of the
gay rights movement: Frank Kameny, Barbara Gittings, Ron Gold, Bruce
Voeller, Howard Brown, and Charles Silverstein. The deed was finally done
on December 15, 1973, thus effecting the quickest cure in history. In what
might be considered something of a run on liberating proclamations, the
APA resolution freeing homosexuals from the stigma of mental illness occurred
the same year the Pope declared that the Jews were no longer to be
blamed for the death of Christ. It would take the American Psychological
Association another year to follow the lead of the American Psychiatric Association,
declaring in January 1975 that homosexuality was not a mental disorder
and deploring discrimination against gays in the public and private
sectors.

[p. <i>175</i>]

Professionally, I continued to edge out into public view. Inspired by the
success of the California State Psychological Association symposium, I negotiated
with UCLA to present their first official program for the public on
the topic of homosexuality. June 21, 1972, several hundred people gathered
for an all-day symposium titled "The Homosexual in America." The panel
included a psychiatrist (enlightened), an attorney (gay legal issues), Dr. Evelyn
Hooker, Morris Kight, Don Kilhefner, and three young gay activists --
including Rand Schrader, a law student (later an openly gay judge). A measure
of the success of this symposium was the document signed by most of
the participants at the end of the day petitioning UCLA to sponsor additional
programs on the topic of homosexuality.


It was only a glimmer so far, but gay visibility was beginning to happen,
sometimes in unexpected and truly memorable ways. I will never forget the
chill down my back as I watched the platform committee sessions of the
Democratic Convention on television in the summer of 1972. One o'clock
in the morning, a tall, thin young man takes the podium, looks directly into
the camera, and says to America, "My name is Jim Foster and I am a gay
man."


I sat bolt upright in bed. In 1972 that was a stunner. Jim Foster was speaking
in favor of a gay rights plank in the party platform. It would take twenty
more years before another gay man, Bob Hattoy, would step up to the podium
to address the Democratic Convention and the nation as an openly
gay man, not at one o'clock in the morning, but in prime time.


My personal evolution as a lesbian was not keeping up with my progress as a
gay activist. While I was now meeting lesbian women, none of these contacts
ripened into anything romantic. I tended to blame this on the "imperfect"
people I was encountering, continuing to be out of touch with how defended
I was against emotional involvement as a lesbian.


It was a sunny summer Sunday at the beach. Roberto and I were drinking
beer at a local pub. "Don't look now," he said, "but that blonde at the bar
is cruising you."


I looked. The "blonde at the bar" was either Candace Bergen or her twin.
"Impossible," I said, "No one who looks like that would be cruising me!"


"Look again."


Yes, this gorgeous woman was definitely staring at me. She smiled. I
smiled back. Soon she joined us at our table. She was not Candace Bergen,

[p. <i>176</i>]

Butch was not interested in a romance with me, but for some reason she
took it upon herself to take charge of my social life. She knew hundreds of
lesbians and she introduced me to all of them. Most were young, in their
twenties and thirties, a few were my own age. They were the vanguard of
what would later be called "lipstick lesbians"—attractive, fashionable
clothes, cars, and apartments, fast-track lives, good jobs, and always up for
a good time.


At Butch's behest, I gave a series of parties at my Hollywood Hills home
that, I'm told, people still talk about. I supplied the food and the booze,
Butch did the inviting, and for a while my house on Saturday night was the
hottest lesbian hangout in town. There were times when several hundred
women were in attendance. They crowded into every room, down the stairwell,
and out onto the two decks. Sometimes I worried that the house would
slide down the hill with all those people in it, but it had survived the earthquake,
so I figured it would probably survive the lesbians.


So here they were: dozens of women in my house, mine to choose from --
well, not quite. They were very interested in my parties. They were not particularly
interested in me. I tried to connect with these lesbians, but I seemed
to have so little in common with them. The good news of gay liberation
had not reached them. They seemed to have few interests beyond gossip,
clothes, restaurants, trips, and their latest love affairs.


I tried desperately to fit in, but I felt like my nose was pressed up against
the window of their lives as it had once been pressed against the window
of Terry's Bar in Greenwich Village. These were not the sad, isolated lesbians
of the '40s and '50s, but in a strangely similar way they also seemed out of
it—too absorbed in their personal dramas to be in touch with what was
happening in the world around them. Though I saw their lives as shallow
and their interests as superficial, I kept trying to be accepted by them.


I staved with this scene longer than I should have, probably because I had
convinced myself that there was something wrong with me. Why couldn't I
loosen up and be like them? I tried to do that by drinking, but that only
brought out the underlying hostility I felt toward these people. My annoyance
with them, which I didn't even acknowledge as such, ensured distance.

[p. <i>177</i>]

Gradually, I retrieved myself, withdrew from Butch and her minions, and
with relief, turned back to the much more exciting and compatible company
of my activist friends. Once again, I was reminded of the danger of trying
to be something I was not. I had spent so much of my life doing that, trying
to be like other people, to be "normal." I didn't even know what "normal"
was anymore, but one thing was clear, even time I went outside myself for
a definition of who I was, I ended up lost and off the compass.


"I'm going to die," Roberto said.


"Come on, what do you mean you're going to die?"


"I'm dying of cancer."


I felt the smile fading from my face. I was visiting Roberto in the hospital
where he'd gone for tests after discovering a large bump on his head. Roberto
was a kidder, and I wasn't ready yet to believe he was telling me the truth.


"What kind of cancer do you have?"


"Bone. They think that's how it started, but it's all through my body now.
There's nothing they can do."


I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "Roberto, is this a joke?"


"No, it's true, I'm going to die."


I asked him to tell me everything the doctor had said, which wasn't much
beyond the awful prognosis that Roberto repeated over and over. Then he
cried, and I held him and cried with him. It felt as though a large dark hole
had opened up and swallowed us both.


When he was hospitalized I went to see him every day, always fearing
what I would see when I got there, wondering if I would be able to handle
it. I took my cue from Roberto; when he was in good humor, we'd gossip
and laugh. Sometimes he'd want to be quiet, and then we'd watch television
together, not needing to say anything.


Every day Roberto grew weaker. His mood fluctuated from sadness to
anger to great calm. On the days when he was feeling better, he took delight
in phoning people he knew in Los Angeles and New York, telling them quite
casually that he was dying of cancer and that there was something he had
been wanting to say to them. Then he would tell them exactly what he
thought was wrong with their lives and what he thought they should do
about it. Some of these people never did believe his opening statement and

[p. <i>178</i>]

Roberto got special care at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he'd been
a respiratory therapist while pursuing his acting career. He was well-liked
by his fellow workers there, and the nurses were attentive to his every need.
Though he could not afford one, he was given a private room as a courtesy.
Friends visited, then fell away as he got sicker, until there were only three
of us left: Joe, an old friend from New York, Shirley, a young nurse he'd
been close to while working at the hospital, and me.


In the fourth week of his hospitalization, I learned what my special assignment
was to be. Roberto had been orphaned as an infant when his parents
were killed in a car crash; he'd been raised by an uncle. Since he'd left Honduras
at eighteen, he'd had little contact with his family. He saw no reason
to have a funeral or burial, so he gave his body to a medical school. He did,
however, want to be memorialized, and that was my job. I was to throw a
wonderful party for him at my house. He told me exactly what kind of food
he wanted served and what music he wanted played, and he provided the
entire guest list. I told him I would do exactly as he wished.


In the fifth week, Roberto was too weak to leave his bed. He was being
heavily sedated on morphine, and he would drift in and out of coherence.
Once, as I sat by his bed, he opened his eyes and tried to sit up. He called
me by a name I'd never heard.


"Chita, let's go out and play," he said. "It's such a pretty day. Take my
hand, I'll show you where we can go." He lay there smiling. Then he began
to speak softly in Spanish, and I knew he was back in Honduras in his childhood
and I was one of his little cousins. I took his hand and held it until
he fell asleep.


On Thursday of the fifth week, as I was leaving, I had to tell Roberto I
wouldn't see him for a few days, until Sunday, because I had to do the California
State Psychological Association presentation. I felt horrible saying it.
How could I not be with him in these last days of his life? What could be
that important? He just smiled at me.


"It's okay," he said, "see ya."


Silently, I asked Roberto to wait for me, not to die until I could be with
him, but he wasn't able to wait. Late Friday afternoon, Shirley called.


"Roberto died," she said quietly. I was devastated. He was thirty-three
years old. He'd hardly lived his life. How unfair, how crazy. Why did this

[p. <i>179</i>]

"Take my hand. I'll show you where we can go."


He always led me. He was doing it again with his party. Though I was
heavy with sadness, on Sunday afternoon my gift to Roberto got underway.
I served the food he had ordered and played the music he requested. Everyone
on the list showed up, people from all parts of Roberto's life, come to
mourn, laugh, cry, and share remembrances of him. Then I, too, received
a gift on this day. Roberto's friend Phil had called to say he couldn't come
to the party because his dog was about to have puppies. I told him it was
okay, but several hours later Phil appeared. He said he had to come for just
a few minutes. Phil was a teacher, a sweet, gentle person. When he left the
party, he went out the door, then came back.


"Would you like one of the puppies?"


"Yes," I said immediately, though I'd never had a pet in my life. After
Phil left I realized I hadn't asked what kind of dog it was—what if it was
a St. Bernard, an English sheep dog? Fortunately, Raggy turned out to be a
small Australian terrier. He was to be my constant companion for the next
fifteen years, feisty, independent, charming, and fun, just like Roberto. And,
like Roberto, he resisted all attempts to tame his natural exuberance to the
demands of obedience, but I didn't care. I adored him, even when he embarrassed me by mounting the leg of every male friend who came through the
front door. I'd yell at the little humper, "Stop!" But he never did. I was
certain that Roberto lived in that dog.
