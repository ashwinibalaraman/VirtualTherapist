BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
(inaudible at 0:00:09)
CLIENT: I know but, I mean, I really, if it wasn't - I really checked, I looked to see like, if I could have canceled and just gone to the next one, I would have, but - and I don't know why I didn't realize when I did it, that it was the same day that we meet.
THERAPIST: The problem is how many makeups are we working on, now? Or, this isn't a makeup.
CLIENT: This is one and then there's would, would be another.
THERAPIST: We may not be able to do the other one. You may just have to pay, just pay for the session.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Because that's, you know, we can try to do makeups, but sometimes when it gets, you know, when you're missing a certain amount, it's just too difficult.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: To keep doing that, especially for scheduling purposes. We can keep trying, but eventually the schedule might become too tight to…
CLIENT: Yeah, no problem, I mean, I figure, if you can do it, but you know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:53)
CLIENT: No, I understand.
THERAPIST: If we can do it.
CLIENT: But yeah, I'm really sorry.
THERAPIST: That's okay. Before we get started I wanted to ask you, I don't have the  consent form on me, right now, but basically there's, you know how I record your sessions?
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: They're just used for me and my supervision, however, someone asked The Order for some research on our E-B-T practices and would like to have the tapes of us, like continuing tapes of patients. The (inaudible at 1:24) would be completely identified and completely used for research purposes. Would you be willing to participate in something like that?
CLIENT: I feel like, when you first told me, I was like, "Is this someone I know?" (Laughing) oh, yeah, yeah, it's okay.
THERAPIST: Okay, so I'll give you the form, next time I see you.
CLIENT: Okay. No problem.
THERAPIST: I know, it's a weird thing to think about.
CLIENT: Yeah, I like, "why do they want me?" you know.
THERAPIST: I know. (Laughing)
CLIENT: They want anyone, not me personally.
THERAPIST: Basically, just to work on the differences between our E-B-T and other forms of therapy.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't mind that, at all.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So it's confidential, my information?
THERAPIST: Everything, you would be unidentified. There would never be a name, address, any (inaudible at 1:59)
CLIENT: If there was a bug in our meeting. (Laughing) (inaudible at 2:01).
THERAPIST: No, it's not going to be like a case study of you. It would be like, I'm sure that the data used would not be, like qualitative data would be like, verbal transcriptions and like telling your case story. This data would probably be something like, "Women are more likely to benefit from…"
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.
THERAPIST: Or from this style of therapy. It's more of, probably, examining what I'm doing, rather than you.
CLIENT: Cool. Cool, whatever. No problem, no problem.
THERAPIST: So how's everything going?
CLIENT: Good, good, a little stressful, in a good way, I mean, I'm happy, it's not like it's annoying and awful stressful, but this whole thing with who's staying in this apartment, like it just takes so long.
THERAPIST: So he still hasn't moved in.
CLIENT: No, he's in, it's just that he needs everything, and it's like, you know, today we had - he had gotten a queen size box frame, for his bed, but he has two floors to his apartment. It's really small, but it has like a sleeping loft.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And they couldn't get the box spring there, so they had to get two, split, like box springs, so like two twin size put together. That came, today. His television came today. He still didn't have a couch. He still doesn't have a desk. It's like… [3:14]
THERAPIST: Are you feeling like, responsible for doing a lot of that stuff for him because he's (inaudible at 3:18) or?
CLIENT: I don't know if I feel responsible. I like helping people, in general, so I don't know if it's really then, like, I mean, yeah, of course, he's my boyfriend, so I'm happy to, but I don't feel like he's putting the, the, like responsibility, on me, because he doesn't know…
THERAPIST: But are you putting the responsibility on you?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Are you putting too much, do you think, or is it…
CLIENT: Probably, but the thing is, I have nothing else to do because I'm not really working. I mean I'm not doing anything, so like, if I were, I wouldn't be able to do like, half of it, you know.
THERAPIST: So, in the percentages of what he's doing, versus what you're doing, for him, what's the percent? How would you break that percent up then? Like, are you doing 50-50? [4:11]
CLIENT: Yeah, I'd say 50-50.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: That's what I mean. Its like, he's not, not that he would like, intentionally take advantage, but sometimes it's easy when like, you're, I mean, he has classes, like four hours a day. So like, he could just like, push everything off on me, if he wanted, but like, you know, I mean, it's 50-50.
THERAPIST: Okay. And more than - my concern is, more than him pushing things on you, you pushing things on you.
CLIENT: Well, I don't really know. I mean, I think I probably, I'm doing more than like, I need to do, or you know, that anyone expects of me, but I'm not like, a crazy like, organized person, so I feel like - I don't know - like the bathroom needs to be cleaned, for a week, and like I said, I didn't do it every day, I still haven't, like…
THERAPIST: In his apartment.
CLIENT: Yeah like, I didn't say I would do it. Actually, we said we'd do it together, because I can't stand cleaning bathrooms like, even my own. So I mean, I don't know. I don't know, like I was supposed to do the laundry, too, or like bring the laundry, and I didn't do it. I mean, I don't know. There's a lot of things that, if I really wanted to be like, I could be doing it and I'm not. [5:22]
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you, are you feeling any kind of resentment towards him, for this, or no?
CLIENT: Um, no, not resentment. I just, I don't like being in the like, domestic position, and I feel like that's the position I'm in because I don't have anything else to do. But he is very like, we both believe like, equal like, sharing of responsibilities, and everything, like no matter what the situation is like, ones working, ones not, which obviously like, in like an ideal world, we'd both be working and doing our own thing, but until that you know, until that happens, the fact that I know things are like, more or less equal and he likes it that way, as well as I do, I think it's all right.
THERAPIST: But when you said - I said is there some resentment, you kind of made a face. [6:13]
CLIENT: It's not resentment, it's just like, I wish I was going to school like, right now, or doing, you know, like working in a job that I want to work. Like, you know what I mean? Like, but, at the same time, I understand. I mean, it's temporary, this situation, you know, I know it's like, not like this is going to be the rest of my life.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I mean, I actually had an interview at Finn, yesterday, for the E-S-L program I'm at.
THERAPIST: Wow, that's fast.
CLIENT: Yeah, but then they don't let us know for four to six weeks. I don't really understand the point of the interview. I guess they just (crosstalk).
THERAPIST: Is it an MA program, what is it?
CLIENT: Yeah, it's an MA program. [6:47]
THERAPIST: In ESL education?
CLIENT: In ESL education, yeah.
THERAPIST: That isn't very long, to find out.
CLIENT: Really, you think so? I'm like, tomorrow, tomorrow. "Don't you know, right now, the essay was good? What do you need to know?" you know.
THERAPIST: Did you have to hand it - you didn't have to give it to her to use, or whatever?
CLIENT: No, that, no, we - it was like, you know, an essay, recommendation, whatever. And then…
THERAPIST: For me for, you know, for remember undergrad? Remember how long you waited?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, it was months.
THERAPIST: Exactly. (Laughing)
CLIENT: But it was a weird interview. It was like the program coordinator and it was five girls, together, it was just like a conversation.
THERAPIST: I've been to interviews, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah, whatever, I mean, that's fine. Then we had to write an essay.
THERAPIST: While you were there or?
CLIENT: Yeah, like a thirty minute essay, and actually, the thing is, I'm really bad a multiple choice test, but I was always, always good, really, really good, at those kinds of like, really quick essays. So I think I probably did all right. Although, I did think my essay was shitty because you know, I'm not used to writing essays, anymore, you know.
THERAPIST: It's been awhile. That's okay.
CLIENT: You know, I think it will be all right. Yeah, and the thing, last night, was for, do you know The New Teachers Project? [7:54]
THERAPIST: Vaguely.
CLIENT: It's like, a program that is really like, geared towards career changers and basically like, they place you, I mean, it's a really selective, competitive program. They place you in high needs like, basically like, crappy schools.
THERAPIST: Is it like Teach for America?
CLIENT: I think, yeah, somewhat like that, and they subsidize your master's program.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But they do send you like, (inaudible at 8:24) so it's not like the most expensive, or necessarily the best schools, anyway, whatever. And…
THERAPIST: So it's - so it's associated with Finn, so if you got into Finn…
CLIENT: It's not associated with Finn. It's separate.
THERAPIST: But I mean, it would work along - it would pay your tuition at Finn?
CLIENT: No, they're two separate things. The thing is, what I wanted to do the (inaudible at 8:43) program for because on the website, they had an online application and I started it, and they said, ESL was one of the high-needs areas, so whatever. But then, when I went, they said that they're not sure that it's going to be, this year. Now it's like special education and science. I'm like, certainly not qualified to teach science.
THERAPIST: So would this be a full time teaching job that they would set you up with?
CLIENT: Yeah, the thing that's different about this program, which is better than going through Finn, or whatever, is that you start teaching immediately and you get your master's while you're doing it, whereas without a master's or without this kind of program, you can't really teach. You have to get the master's first, then…
THERAPIST: Do you feel comfortable teaching without some education first, or like, is there an advantage to one or the other? Because you sound like you're really gung ho, you want, really want to just get into it and start teaching.
CLIENT: That's the thing, I mean, only because I want to get paid, but I don't really care about anything else, you know what I mean like, I'd prefer to have the degree, but.
THERAPIST: But it could be a little scare, being thrown into an inner-city school, having never taught before.
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I mean, I think like, I've taught - I mean, I was teaching in Portugal. I was teaching in school, inner-city like, high needs school, and Chicago, is very, very different, but I think I'm comfortable enough in a teaching environment, where I could, where I could be all right.
THERAPIST: Okay, no I'm just trying to make you aware of…
CLIENT: But the things is, like with Finn like, the first year is just classes, so you could work, you know. Then the second year, they pull out like, clinical experience, and I kinda just want to be like - I'm not trying to be shitty because obviously I like teaching. I love teaching and I think it's a really reputable profession, but like, I don't need to be spending two years of my life in a full time like, academic program and not get paid for a year of it. Like, I don't know, I just think that's really shitty. [10:29]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think it should - but the thing is to have an option. They really try to push you towards student teaching, which is unpaid. But the other option is, if you find a job, they will substitute it and call it like, practicum, or something.
THERAPIST: Okay, as long as you get some supervision.
CLIENT: So yeah, you get supervision. It's the same, but you're to like, student teaching, you're teaching.
THERAPIST: Okay, so there's…
CLIENT: There's an option.
THERAPIST: So these are like, the two - are these the only programs that you've applied for?
CLIENT: Yeah, basically.
THERAPIST: Okay and you both find out, probably, before the next semester, I guess. Four to six weeks.
CLIENT: Well, the thing is, the teaching fellows program, I haven't applied to. I haven't finished the application. I have to finish it by the 21st of October, and they tell you, really quickly, if you are invited for an interview, but they don't tell you their decision until like, the spring. [11:18]
THERAPIST: So that would be the difference between getting into Finn, would be…
CLIENT: Mm-hm. The thing is I, if I got accepted to Finn, I would go in January or February, regardless.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then if I then decided I wanted to do this teaching fellows program, I would just probably lose the money and the credits that went to (inaudible at 11:36) all semester, but…
THERAPIST: Okay, you would be willing to do that?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean…
THERAPIST: And you like that program, the idea of the program? You may change your mind if you get an interview, you never know like, until you go on an interview.
CLIENT: Yeah, I really do like the Finn program, but…
THERAPIST: And you still have some time to see it. If you really like it, you could say, well, you know...
CLIENT: Right, screw the other one over. But the thing is, like I said, the teaching fellows program doesn't have ESL. So I basically have to...
THERAPIST: Oh, they don't?
CLIENT: No they-because it's not a high-needs area, anymore, so I would be applying to teach special ed, which…
THERAPIST: That's not your choice.
CLIENT: I like the idea of special ed, but realistically, teaching special ed, in any school, has to be difficult, especially considering that you don't have any…
THERAPIST: And then working in a high-need school.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean, to add the…
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 12:24) I found that unfortunate like, what I've heard about Teach for America and things like that is a lot of time, honestly, the truth is that these people aren't prepared to go in. Like, they say, "Oh, we have like, this training program…
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: …train for six months and then we send you off into the most difficult schools, where a teacher with experience for 30 years would struggle."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So a lot of people - I've heard - because I have a friend who does Teach for America in Los Angeles…
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: Which is a certainly…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: …it's like one of the recovery school districts.
CLIENT: Right. That's awful.
THERAPIST: Actually she was special ed, there.
CLIENT: Oh, really?
THERAPIST: So - and she loves it, actually. It's, she's like, found her calling. But from what I've heard, a lot of people feel kind of like the set these people up for failure.
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean…
THERAPIST: Send you in to only be like, "I never want to do this." when it's not, what was the most realistic like, job that you would get if you weren't in this program?"
CLIENT: Right. Right.
THERAPIST: And you're different…
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Because you're going to have no resources, and those districts don't really get…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But just something to be aware of that, you know, it's going to be, probably, tough.
CLIENT: I mean, (inaudible at 13:26)
THERAPIST: I think you may be deluding yourself, a little that the ESL program will be it. I've had special…
CLIENT: No, the ESL program will be good.
THERAPIST: …as the special. It could be as bad as the special ed population, with seriousness.
CLIENT: Yeah. With ESL, they're not necessarily in a high-needs school.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: Not necessarily, I mean, you could be, if you want. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's…
THERAPIST: It could be something (inaudible at 13:48).
CLIENT: Yeah, the teaching is not, it's not easy, you know.
THERAPIST: Well, you've certainly got a very strong word. I mean, I'm - my first training is as school psychologist.
CLIENT: Oh, really?
THERAPIST: So yes, I'm familiar with working in schools, and I am actually working in a school, right now, for emotionally disturbed children.
CLIENT: Oh, wow.
THERAPIST: So yeah, it's, you know, it's certainly, you work with (inaudible at 14:06) resources, even though you should have more.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You would think, at a school like that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you know, it can be very rewarding. It can be very frustrating.
CLIENT: Yeah, I thought about doing school psychology.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That's a lot of years, I think. And the thing is…
THERAPIST: Plus three years, if you just want an MA.
CLIENT: Oh, cool, that's cool.
THERAPIST: You can get - a master's in school psychology is a three year program, and then um, I'm getting a doctorate in school psychology.
CLIENT: Oh, coo.
THERAPIST: Then, once you have clinical experience, in the state of Illinois, when you're licensed - like, this would be considered clinical experience - then I could work in either the clinical or the school situation.
CLIENT: Oh, that's great. That's really great. No, it's really cool. Yeah, so I don't know, I mean, we'll see what happens. I think I would prefer the ESL program, just because, I don't know, it's really what I'm more, a little bit more interested in, and if you're like, if you're not that interested in special ed and a high needs school, it's you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah, so what's (inaudible at 15:04)?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then maybe something to stick to. And you never know, with the other program, the ESL might pop up again, as something that they need people.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, so, we'll being in financial aid, anyway, right because I'm like, currently like, unemployed, so maybe they'll have mercy on me, you know. And also, I qualify for this grant which will end up paying for like, half of Finn's tuition, anyway because I've already got the BA, whatever.
THERAPIST: And you're definitely going to get the grant, or you think it should happen?
CLIENT: I mean, it's basically like if you have a certain GPA, or over, and I have like four points over, four points, point four, or whatever, and that's it, you just - I'd fill out the - fax the thing and, great, so hopefully it works out, whatever.
THERAPIST: Okay. And then you would get a job in the meantime?
CLIENT: Well, the other thing is - I don't know if I told you this but - I mean, this is so random and it almost seems like, too good to be true, but my mom works at a school, she's a school secretary, but she's worked in school for like, fifteen years, she knows a lot of people. And she, in the ESL department, in her school, I guess the head of the department went to some convention, an ESL whatever, and they told her that there was extra funding for ESL, and she didn't know, so she put in a request for a grant, to have someone come every day. Basically, you know how substitute teachers get paid like, a daily rate? [16:24]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It's like that, you'd get, I'd get paid every day, but it's basically shadowing her, helping ESL kids with like whatever they need.
THERAPIST: And you get paid.
CLIENT: You get paid, like yeah, like a substitute teacher's rate, which is like fine.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm, that's good enough.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's fine, it's like $150 a day, I mean, whatever, you know.
THERAPIST: And it'd be like getting some experience and see…
CLIENT: Yeah, like really good experience.
THERAPIST: Kind of really see if that's what you want to do, right?
CLIENT: Mm-hm. So if I could do that, while going to school, it'd be like, like...
THERAPIST: When would you find out about that?
CLIENT: My mom said she, the woman said, any day, you know, so I'm like, you know, hoping.
THERAPIST: So it sounds like everything's coming together. You know, I actually was concerned, because we hadn't really talked about career stuff, that much.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I was like, "I wonder if she is getting a job."
CLIENT: Well, the thing is…
THERAPIST: You sound like you're on top of it.
CLIENT: I'm like (inaudible at) I would be putting like, "almost always" next to like, "do you feel, you know, happy about your work, situation," or whatever, or unhappy, whatever because I would be really, like, down on myself if I had nothing, but if this works out too, it'll be amazing, it's like the perfect, and it's so rare to get an opportunity like that, in the board of ed.
THERAPIST: So it looks like things are going well. (inaudible at 17:30)
CLIENT: Yeah, depending on how it works out, you know.
THERAPIST: Like, you're working hard and you're pursuing other avenues, and if that doesn't happen, you know, you can go to Finn, you know, $50 a day, big money.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, or like whatever, work in a store.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So, it sounds like you have a lot of options, and hopefully you'll hear back from Finn, and it sounds like you have the grades to meet their requirements, so maybe that...
CLIENT: Yeah, so hopefully it's okay. Hopefully.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 17:54) and probably, compared to the other people, where other people have experience being abroad, and things like that.
CLIENT: The other people at the interview?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It was, I was actually surprised. They were all like teaching, in some capacity, already. One was doing an ESL, in night school. Another was teaching in like, (inaudible at 18:15). You know that academy?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: It's like, I remember I feel like it's always in the subways, whatever. Um, she's teaching there, another one's teaching, the other two were teaching. I don't know, it was really weird.
THERAPIST: So you were the only one without teaching experience?
CLIENT: It's like teaching experience here, yeah. I know like, I was interviewing (inaudible at).
THERAPIST: You were teaching adults, though, and…
CLIENT: Both children and adults, yeah.
THERAPIST: Oh, I thought it was only adults.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. So you'll see, right?
CLIENT: Well, yeah, I mean…
THERAPIST: Where did you go to undergrad?
CLIENT: University of Chicago.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you have a strong application.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And actually, to be honest with you, the problem coordinator at the open house which was weeks ago, someone asked, "Like well, if I don't have this, blah, blah, blah," and he was like "well, basically, if you fit all of the requirements and you know like, everything is fine," he's like, "you're going to get in." so I feel like...
THERAPIST: Teaching problems aren't always the most difficult.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But if it doesn't work out, you'll find other options, I'm sure. Finn's not the only school that has an ESL program.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: You might have to wait for the fall, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. That the thing.
THERAPIST: Okay. And if you do…
CLIENT: I mean, it's not the end of the world.
THERAPIST: Yeah, you think that?
CLIENT: Yeah, really I do.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But I'm going to be really pissed because I'm going to have to think of something really quick, to do in the meantime, but…
THERAPIST: You can still [do - that's a thing that comes with the school, right] (ph)?
CLIENT: The what?
THERAPIST: The ESL thing, you could do that for the year?
CLIENT: Oh, yeah, that's the great thing about it, so…
THERAPIST: I mean, if you didn't get in, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly.
THERAPIST: And then you'd build up your resume so you'd surely get in the next year.
CLIENT: It's like when you're kind of in limbo, where you don't know what's going to happen you know. That's what's annoying about it, is like, I don't know if it's definite.
THERAPIST: It sounds like, to me that you're dealing with it appropriately, and you're functioning well. [19:45]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or do you think that it's affecting you that you're not getting other things done and…would you say it's a dysfunctional level of anxiety, or would you just say it's like concern?
CLIENT: No. It's concern. It's not really.
THERAPIST: So it's healthy, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You can't really do anything about it.
CLIENT: I mean, yeah, it's totally fine.
THERAPIST: All right, so let's move on to your homework.
CLIENT: Yeah, I didn't do it, again.
THERAPIST: I figured.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But that's okay. You know, if…
CLIENT: I have to just tell you. This has been like a year and a half of a struggle, so I'm just warning you, it might not happen as quickly as we would both like.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But I will, I am trying.
THERAPIST: And I realize that. But I think, actually, because I did some thinking and I spoke about it, with my supervisor.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: And he raised a good point. You know, this problem goes well beyond Portuguese speaking, to an extent. Would you say it's kind of a history of having difficulty admitting that you've made mistakes?
CLIENT: Yeah. People, and it's funny, because people always say that to me, but I feel like I always admit when I'm wrong, or like if I make a mistake.
THERAPIST: But who do you admit - do you really admit it to other people, or do you admit it to yourself?
CLIENT: I don't know if I… [20:58]
THERAPIST: I feel like you admit it to yourself, and then you beat yourself up about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you tell other people when you've messed up, or do you keep it to yourself?
CLIENT: Ooh, that's tough. I don't know. I'm trying' to think of the last time I - well, the last time I fucked something up royally was when I was deported. I told some people.
THERAPIST: How many?
CLIENT: Some friends.
THERAPIST: Over three?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you told a few people.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But that was like a pretty major thing you had to (inaudible at)?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean.
THERAPIST: What about everyday things. Like can you - why don't we talk about what mistakes have you made since last that I seen you? Like, I mean they could be stupid things like, I fell going, you know, or had my, my dress tucked into my…
CLIENT: Well, I fall and break things, all the time, because I'm clumsy.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I don't know…
THERAPIST: So is that not something that's embarrassing to you?
CLIENT: It's not embarrassing to me, for some reason. [22:02]
THERAPIST: What would be something that would be embarrassing to you?
CLIENT: Why is it so hard, there's so many things?
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 22:11) because I'm not quite sure if the emotion is embarrassment or "I can't stand to feel, kind of, like I've made mistakes." you know. Like a frustration.
CLIENT: Yeah. God um…
THERAPIST: Which causes like an anger with yourself, afterwards. So, I mean, because when we were talking about the softball thing, that was like a….
CLIENT: All right, I'll tell you one thing I can think of, only because there was an argument I had with (inaudible at 22:38) and it comes to mind. I don't know if this is what you're thinking of, but we had to install shades, and he did it, and I - he wanted it really shittily done, and he knew that, and I knew that but I tried to pull it up, anyway, even though I knew I probably shouldn't have, and it fell down. He was really angry. And I don't think I accepted responsibility for that, actually. (Laughing.)
THERAPIST: What happened? You were like, "Well you didn't put it in right."
CLIENT: I have a problem. My brain has a problem, (inaudible at 23:12) my brain has a problem identifying when it's an accident and like, so are you responsible because it was an accident and there wasn't any like, mal-intent behind it, or are you just always responsible when you do something wrong?
THERAPIST: So not only is there trouble like, admitting when there's mistakes made, to other people, but there's also, kind of, difficulty in taking responsibility for something that went wrong, even if you didn't do it on purpose?
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, then I think, well I did take responsibility for it, because I apologized.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So I said, "I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done that. I should've asked," or whatever.
THERAPIST: So why did you say you didn't really take responsibility for it?
CLIENT: Because it was an accident, so like, you know, just get over it.
THERAPIST: Was he mad?
CLIENT: Yeah, he was mad. Well, I mean, he wasn't like - he was just annoyed. He was like, just pissed off because he had to redo it. It was really annoying.
THERAPIST: So why did you do it? Why did you pull the…
CLIENT: Because I wanted light. It was depressing. The shade was pulled down.
THERAPIST: Was he working on it, at the time, and then you pulled on it?
CLIENT: Oh, no, no. He was in the shower, or something.
THERAPIST: Okay. And it was in his apartment. [24:20]
CLIENT: Yeah,
THERAPIST: So maybe it wasn't your place to pull that.
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe, but…
THERAPIST: So when he said - did he come back and it had fallen, or he saw you do it?
CLIENT: No, he heard it, and he was like, "What did you do?" I was like, "Nothing." and I tried to fix it really quickly, but it didn't work. I think might have screwed it up more.
THERAPIST: So when he said, "What did you do?" you were like, were you like…
CLIENT: I said, I tried to pull the shade.
THERAPIST: You're like, "I'm sorry, you should've put it up right."
CLIENT: No, no, I said, "I'm sorry, I tried to pull the shade up and it fell." and he was like, "but you knew that it was going to fall." and I said, "Yeah, but I thought if I did it slowly that it would be fine."
THERAPIST: I don't know if that's the same thing that we're talking about.
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm telling you, I take responsibility a lot.
THERAPIST: Yeah, okay. So…
CLIENT: I try, at least.
THERAPIST: But what about - remember when you were telling me the story about the softball.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like what if tomorrow, someone's like, "everyone's going to go play softball, in the park."
CLIENT: Yeah that's it, I know.
THERAPIST: Would you say, "I'm terrible at softball"?
CLIENT: I'd say, "I'm terrible at softball. I'm not playing."
THERAPIST: So it's not really, kind of, admitting when you make a mistake, but it's actually being observed doing the thing that you're bad at? [25:36]
CLIENT: Yeah, it's admitting...
THERAPIST: Because it's not, you can tell people, "I'm bad at Portuguese."
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's not a problem.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: It's the, actually performing.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Something that you don't feel that you're competent in.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you think competence is enough for you to feel - like, what if you were competent at playing softball, would you do it, or would you have to be good at it?
CLIENT: No, competent.
THERAPIST: And the same thing goes with Portuguese, like if you felt more competent?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Would that - like, right now, you may be competent at Portuguese, but you don't perceive yourself to be competent.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I probably am, especially if I practice just a little bit, but I don't think that I am, even if I am, yeah. [26:12]
THERAPIST: So what about practicing softball? You don't think that you could be competent at softball, even if you practiced it?
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe. But the idea of, we're all going to go play, which then has the idea, like, "Oh, we're all pretty good at softball, and we expect, you know, each other."
THERAPIST: But they're all like - what if someone's like, "I've never played before."
CLIENT: Those bastards are always the ones that (inaudible at). I hate those people.
THERAPIST: But what if you went with three of your friends and it was like, and informal game?
CLIENT: My friends are all really good at softball, but…
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 26:41) is not good at softball. He's never played, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, but he's really athletic. He's like one of those pieces of shit that's good at everything.
THERAPIST: All right, so what if you went - okay, so what if they were like, "we're going to go play softball," and (inaudible at) was like, "It's my birthday." so you have to do it, now, right?
CLIENT: You'd think that I would, but I probably wouldn't. I'd probably say, "I'll go and cheer, but…"
THERAPIST: All right, let's imagine that…
CLIENT: To be honest with you, if it was a group of people, maybe some of my friends who I knew were really good at softball and other people like (inaudible at 27:19) who've never played before, I think I might be willing to do it. And I'd feel like, "Look, I'm going to strike out. I'm going to be bad. I'm not going to catch the ball, but I want to play."
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I think I would.
THERAPIST: So let's imagine that you know, you're going, you're going out to the plate.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: What's the most embarrassing part, like the, the, the batting, or the catching?
CLIENT: I think the catching would be the easy fall, like, and missing them is the most embarrassing.
THERAPIST: Okay, so like let's imagine that you are in the outfield, and here comes like, the easiest hit and run. (inaudible at 27:51)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What emotion are you feeling, now because all your friends are around?
CLIENT: I don't know, fear, anxiety.
THERAPIST: Fear, anxiety?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. And what would go on if - because there's the anxiety before, and then there's the, would you say, anger, afterwards? What would happen if - okay, suppose the ball comes and like, one of those like (inaudible at 28:17).
CLIENT: That would be lucky, rather than it like, hitting my head, or like just dropping.
THERAPIST: So it could be, so it could be anything?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So it hits you in the head.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or you just are like…
CLIENT: Or it (inaudible at). Yeah.
THERAPIST: What emotion would you feel, with everyone watching you?
CLIENT: I don't know, it could be anger, but I don't know if that would be the strongest one.
THERAPIST: It would be embarrassment or shame, what would be stronger?
CLIENT: Shame, maybe shame. Like shame and anger, mixture.
THERAPIST: Shame and anger, so…
CLIENT: Or more shame.
THERAPIST: Anger towards yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Not anger towards everyone else?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: You're not saying, "Fuck you. Quit looking at me." [28:58]
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: "mind your business."
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: You wouldn't say, "Quit judging me."
CLIENT: Maybe I'd say, "These stupid people, why did they want me to play in the first place?" like I don't know.
THERAPIST: So there's like, a little anger, maybe, towards others. Mostly anger towards yourself...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: …and shame. What do you think is stronger, the shame or the anger?
CLIENT: I don't know, I want to say the shame, but maybe it's the anger. I don't know. I have to think about it.
THERAPIST: So um, you're feeling angry?
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: That's an emotion (inaudible at 29:39). What thoughts would be going through your head? Like, "I should have caught the ball" or…
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean…
THERAPIST: "I shouldn't have come out here, at all."
CLIENT: Yeah, probably, "I shouldn't have come here." I mean, that's…
THERAPIST: You knew it was going to go like this, why would you…
CLIENT: Yeah, but I'm just not sure that I would be that embarrassed, anymore, playing, I don't know, maybe I would be. It just depends on the people.
THERAPIST: I'm just using this as an example, because they're probably like thoughts that go through your mind in other situations.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, "I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have done this. I should have just stayed on the sidelines."
THERAPIST: If other - so why shouldn't you have come?
CLIENT: Because I suck at this and...
THERAPIST: So what if you suck at this?
CLIENT: Well, maybe these people wanted to win the game and I'm the person who…
THERAPIST: Okay, but they don't look at you angry, so what's wrong?
CLIENT: They're not - they're trying to be nice. They're hiding their anger.
THERAPIST: Okay, so people are angry with you. That's kind of like the issue.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: What if people are disappointed with you?
CLIENT: I don't know. I just, I would feel bad, I don't know how else to…
THERAPIST: If people were disappointed with me, I couldn't stand it. There's probably some of that, right?
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.
THERAPIST: Would it, if people were disappointed in me that would mean I'm worthless?
CLIENT: Maybe.
THERAPIST: Okay, is there anything else, like, "if people are disappointed with me, fuck them"? No. You wouldn't say that, at this point?
CLIENT: Yeah, probably, probably would.
THERAPIST: What's the strongest because I'm thinking that the strongest is, "I couldn't stand it." but I think that's the before you do something. And then like, you know the anxiety before, you have to perform something that you're worried about?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: "I couldn't stand to feel the…" and then in the moment, when it happens, it's the self loathing. [31:45]
CLIENT: Yeah, probably.
THERAPIST: So what if someone's disappointed with you? What's wrong with that? What does that mean?
CLIENT: Well, in this case it would be, "Oh, a lot of people are disappointed." but if someone was disappointed in me, I mean…
THERAPIST: Someone that you care about?
CLIENT: I would just feel like I did something wrong.
THERAPIST: Okay, have you ever disappointed someone before?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: And did they cut ties with you, immediately?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: And have other people disappointed you?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you cut ties with them?
CLIENT: Some yes.
THERAPIST: So because I think this is actually, I think you do have, you have a lot of intolerance for mistakes and imperfections in yourself…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: …and remember, we talked about this, kind of, before, in the very beginning, when you first started coming to sessions that you also, sometimes, anger out towards other people.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So there's a lot of intolerance of any mistakes being made.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think so. So then like…
THERAPIST: I think most of it is in yourself, but it extends outwardly.
CLIENT: Definitely.
THERAPIST: Right? (inaudible at 33:10) okay, so there's - what was I saying.
CLIENT: About the intolerance for mistakes.
THERAPIST: Okay, so you've tolerated before.
CLIENT: Right. (crosstalk) my mistakes.
THERAPIST: Why would - if everybody makes mistakes sometimes, Angela, everyone disappoints people, why is it not okay for you to do so?
CLIENT: I don't know, it's actually, I think about it now, it's really true. Like I really feel like it's the end of the world when someone's disappointed in me. Like, I say…
THERAPIST: So you think they won't love you, anymore? Is that kind of where it goes down to?
CLIENT: Maybe, maybe.
THERAPIST: But you know that they will, or most people will.
CLIENT: But now everyone, you don't know. You know what I mean?
THERAPIST: But, okay, that's true. If you disappointed someone, they could stop loving you, potentially.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Depending on how big that disappointment is, right?
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: But could they ever stop loving you even if you didn't disappoint them?
CLIENT: Yeah. (Chuckling)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That's true.
THERAPIST: So like, I think it comes down to…
CLIENT: But I think if they - okay, this is going to sound really stupid, but if they did stop loving me because, even if I didn't ever do anything wrong, then I wouldn't have to blame myself because I know that I didn't do anything wrong. But if I know that I made mistakes, sand disappointed them, it's much easier to say, "Oh, it's your fault." or you know, maybe not completely, but on some level.
THERAPIST: And what if you're not perfect? [34:31]
CLIENT: If I'm not perfect it's okay because nobody's perfect, but if my imperfections lead to somebody not loving me, or…
THERAPIST: But how would you ever know if it's - you know, I think sometimes, like, okay, suppose you let someone down, and they broke up with you, would you say, really, the whole reason they broke up with you was because of the one incident?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Were there a lot of other things that are going on and they're like, this is the final straw? I mean, it would have to be a pretty big disappointment, for someone to say, "No, I don't love you anymore."
CLIENT: Yeah, of course, no, it's true.
THERAPIST: So you kind of take on a lot of responsibility, yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like your one move, your one (inaudible at) edge, can make or break a whole relationship with a person.
CLIENT: No, it's not.
THERAPIST: But you believe it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So let's work with that. You know what I mean?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: So…
CLIENT: (phone ringing) Sorry. [35:29]
THERAPIST: Hold on.
CLIENT: No, I don't know who it is, actually. I have no idea. Yeah, it's true.
THERAPIST: So right now you're telling yourself, kind of, "I must, I must not disappoint people because they might not love me anymore if I did."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That's, would you say that that's kind of your major irrational belief?
CLIENT: I don't know because it sounds so stupid, like to say it like that, but…
THERAPIST: Say like, "I must not disappoint people because…" because it's unbearable to disappoint people and…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I must not disappoint people - is it mostly the people you care about?
CLIENT: I think it true, though, I think it is like either they won't like me anymore, or they won't love me. Like, you know, if it's a friend and I'm not, that I don't love, or whatever.
THERAPIST: They might not like you anymore.
CLIENT: They might not like me, but if it's someone that I love, they might not love me.
THERAPIST: And that would be more unbearable than someone just not liking you anymore. [36:20]
CLIENT: I think, no I mean, if it's a good friend, I think it's equal.
THERAPIST: All right, so someone more like, an acquaintance.
CLIENT: Oh, no I meant like. I don't know, because I do love my friends, but like you think of it…
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So, yeah, yeah, I think it's the same.
THERAPIST: Okay, so it is really, "I must not disappoint people, or make mistakes…" why do you think that your personal mistakes are so disappointing to other people, they have nothing else going on in their lives?
CLIENT: I don't know, I think it's because I'm so hard on myself when I make mistakes that I perceive it to be a much bigger mistake, or I don't know, affect people more than it does.
THERAPIST: So maybe it's the way you're thinking about it?
CLIENT: Yeah, probably.
THERAPIST: So the way you're thinking about it, it's kind of that catastrophic thinking again, that you have a tendency to, to do. So like, "Oh, I made a mistake, now they're not going to want to be my friend anymore. They're not going to want to life with me anymore.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That would be horrible.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So what if, what if they didn't want to be your friend anymore? What if they did want to break up with you because of a mistake you made? [37:29]
CLIENT: Well…
THERAPIST: Could you stand it?
CLIENT: I mean, yeah. Well, the thing is, if someone broke up with me over a mistake that I made, I think that I could stand it. Well, I don't know, but yeah, just say. But if a friend stopped like, wanting to be my friend because of a mistake, I don't know.
THERAPIST: Because friendships are supposed to endure more than relationships?
CLIENT: Yeah, like, I think maybe I couldn't stand it. Like that's never happened to me, actually, but unless I, I equally didn't want to be friends with them (Chuckles) you know, but yeah.
THERAPIST: So you know that…
CLIENT: Sometimes it think like, I have so many flaws, like I'm so imperfect and I made some many mis - like I know you're not supposed to think about your past, or whatever, but like I've done so many shitty things, in the past that like, I have to be perfect now, not perfect, but like, because I've recognized that, because I've realized these things, I should focus on not making as many mistakes. You know what I mean?
THERAPIST: Yeah, but you know, when you focus so hard on not making mistakes…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: …you probably make more.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's true. [38:46]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And it's not like…
THERAPIST: You're worried about making mistakes.
CLIENT: I focus on it all the time, and I still make mistakes. You know what I mean? It's like…
THERAPIST: And you're (inaudible at) over the mistakes that you've made, in the past, and the future mistakes that you might make, that you're kind of, ruining potential relationships.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, you said, you know, when (inaudible at) didn't call you, you assumed there was something that you did wrong.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I must have did something wrong to make him…" but you put a lot of power on yourself.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: That your mistakes control the destiny of all these relationships. When people fall out of love, all the time, sometimes it's not even related to the person.
CLIENT: Yeah. That's true.
THERAPIST: Sometimes people change and, other people and friendships grow. What if you couldn't control this? What if friendships or relationships weren't invented and you being competent and perfect, all the time…
CLIENT: I don't know, I have a problem with that, I do.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah, because I feel like I think I do believe, although I know, on some level that it's not true that if I make less mistakes that I can keep things the way I want them. [39:51]
THERAPIST: You know, the - when you say this, Laura, it's like, it's kind of like, the OCD person who says, "if I can only turn the door handle 20 times before I leave the house."
CLIENT: Honestly, sometimes I think I have OCD.
THERAPIST: Well, you know…
CLIENT: In weird ways, not the, the…
THERAPIST: Because they're thoughts that you have to control things for the world to go well.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But you know, that wouldn't be entirely shocking because OCD is considered an anxiety disorder.
CLIENT: Oh, really?
THERAPIST: And a lot of psychologists would say, and this is just like (inaudible at 40:39). I don't know if you're going to care, but anxiety runs a whole continuum range, and you know, from OCD, general anxiety disorder, people who are prone to like, I can't think of the word, you know, when you're having a traumatic. What's it called? Post traumatic stress. You know, you're at risk for all these things, even OCD and eating disorders have been very closely linked because of the ritualistic behaviors.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Like only eating certain things, having to do things a certain way.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So there's a lot of commonalities between. So you can see that, but you would think if I told you, "fine, if you really want to control things, turn that door handle 20 times," you'd say, "that's ridiculous." right?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And then you (inaudible at 41:14). No, if you do that, all your relationships are going to be fine. This is pretty ridiculous, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It's not very logical?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Is your behavior logical?
CLIENT: No. (Chuckles)
THERAPIST: And when I point it out, do you think that then, you know, pointing it out, over and over again, to yourself, "that's really not logical to think this way," could help you from stop thinking that you have to be perfect, all the time to protect your relationships?
CLIENT: If I thought about it?
THERAPIST: Yeah, like if you start thinking that it's not really logical?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, you have three disputes (inaudible at). It doesn't really make any sense, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean, it makes a little sense, but not to the point that you have to be perfect all the time.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You try hardest, but you know, you don't have to try so hard, right?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And apparently you realize that you've made a lot of mistakes and it hasn't been the end to all of your relationships.
CLIENT: True.
THERAPIST: There are probably other components involved, other than just your, making the wrong choices, or disappointing people.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And functionally, you say it's not really helping your life.
CLIENT: No. [42:19]
THERAPIST: It's not helping foster your relationships or hold relationships.
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: There are a lot of reasons to change this.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You know, some would say, "before you can really work on changing this, you need a new belief, because your irrational belief is the one that you think, all the time."
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Remember? Remember, like, "I can stand it. I can stand it if this happens." we talked about (inaudible at 42:38) you needed a new thought. So what could your new thought be, instead of, "I must be perfect." or "I must not make a mistake and disappoint people. Or else the relationship will be over and I'm worthless"?
CLIENT: I can try to not be perfect, but…
THERAPIST: I can try my best…
CLIENT: My best, but if I'm not perfect then, but if I'm not perfect it's, I mean, really, it doesn't matter. I mean like…
THERAPIST: I can still accept myself?
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I mean, I was going to say, "If I'm not perfect and I disappoint people, it's not going to be the end of the world. I can still accept myself."
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think that both of those are really important, because there's the catastrophising (ph) part, where you say, "oh no, I'm going to lose everything, blah, blah, blah. And everyone's going to hate me" to "I hate myself because I can't believe I let myself make a mistake again." [43:39]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And the more you say that to yourself, the more mistakes you're going to make, and the more you ruminate about it, the more that you're likely you're going to start (inaudible at) people.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: With your crazy behavior.
CLIENT: Yeah, it's true. It's true.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: That way, like, you know, change your demand into a preference. "You know, like it'd be nice if I could make less mistakes, but if I can, it's not the end of the world and I can still accept myself." [44:05]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: How do you think you'd feel because you said, before you know, you felt a lot of anger towards yourself.
CLIENT: If I make a mistake?
THERAPIST: Yeah. What would you feel now, maybe if you're, if you're telling yourself that? Say you made a mistake, like you promised to meet (inaudible at 44:22) somewhere and you forgot. He was there for three house, by himself.
CLIENT: Um…
THERAPIST: Tell yourself, that statement, your rational belief.
CLIENT: I would, with, with that, and appropriating that, like if would, if I could've met (inaudible at). I would've liked to have remembered that kind of meeting with Lucy (ph), or whatever, um, but I forgot and it was an accident, and I said to myself…
THERAPIST: It's not the end of the world.
CLIENT: …it's not the end of the world.
THERAPIST: I'll try to make it up to him.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And everybody makes mistakes.
CLIENT: Yeah, there's something, I don't know if it's time because it's probably like running out. Yeah, um, just that, I think there are some mistakes, like, if that happened, although no, the truth is, I would feel really bad about it. [45:23]
THERAPIST: I think most people feel bad.
CLIENT: I mean, I know I'm a certain way, like I'm disorganized and like really clumsy, so certain things, I don't get as upset with myself for, although I do get upset, but there are others.
THERAPIST: Okay, so what are the things that are the most intolerable things, for you?
CLIENT: I think it's more like, if I lose my temper, or if - yeah, I think it's more things like that, when I lose control of my emotions.
THERAPIST: What if you were like - do you cry during movies?
CLIENT: Yeah, sometimes.
THERAPIST: Do you get embarrassed, when you cry during movies?
CLIENT: No, not really.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: But I think…
THERAPIST: Try to think of a way that you could - let's try to think of a way, I mean, short of practicing Portuguese, you know, we don't have another example, so if you feel like that's too hard, right now, we can work up to it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But what is something that would be, you know, anxiety provoking? You know, thinking about, what if you said to (inaudible at), "we have to play softball in the park."
CLIENT: Oh…
THERAPIST: Going to like a batting cage.
CLIENT: Maybe, maybe, maybe I can do that. [46:34]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I think I could possibly.
THERAPIST: You think you could do that (inaudible at 46:38)? I mean he has a lot of free time (inaudible at 46:40).
CLIENT: Yeah. It would be difficult because I have to be like, "Look, I'm really bad at softball, thus, I would."
THERAPIST: Would you say, "this is a therapy assignment"?
CLIENT: Yeah, I told him already, "I have to speak to my therapist."
THERAPIST: Oh, he knows. What'd he say?
CLIENT: He's known that I have a problem with this, for so long, that he's, yeah, he's basically waiting for me just to do it, you know, he's not saying like, "You're supposed to do your homework." but..
THERAPIST: So maybe you can go to the batting cage, this weekend?
CLIENT: Yeah, maybe.
THERAPIST: That could be fun for him.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Well, he's tried to learn about baseball, this week, especially with the Cubs, yeah.
THERAPIST: So that could be a fun thing, and he'll probably suck too, right?
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: At first, maybe he'll get good, real fast.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think I can definitely do that. What I might have more of a problem with, is playing on a team, or something, with him.
THERAPIST: Well, we can work up to that.
CLIENT: Yeah. So I seem (inaudible at).
THERAPIST: Do you think that that would be anxiety provoking though, doing it in front of him?
CLIENT: The…
THERAPIST: Batting.
CLIENT: Just batting?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, maybe a little, a little. I'll think about it. If I think that, well maybe we'll just do it anyway because it's funny, fun. Well, maybe yeah, maybe I'll just do that, and if I find that it's not then we can think of something else. [48:01]
THERAPIST: Then we can think of something else. We'll try that?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Unless there's something else you can think of, real fast. Portuguese.
CLIENT: I know, that's the big one. No.
THERAPIST: I mean, I think there's probably a lot of things out there.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think, I'll try to think of other things.
THERAPIST: Because I don't want you to like lose your temper at him, (inaudible at).
CLIENT: I know, I know. I'm going to try to think of, of recent things…
THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe make a list.
CLIENT: Yeah. And then…
THERAPIST: Keep a list of embarrassing mistakes that you made, this week.
CLIENT: Embarrassing mistakes.
THERAPIST: The batting cages would be a fun, I think experiment to do, to see if it does provoke the anxiety um, because you say right now, it wouldn't, but I wonder if, when you're doing really bad, you know.
CLIENT: Actually, you know what else gives me anxiety, and this would be really good because I want to do this, anyway. For some reason, running with him because I, my run is honestly I go fast walk. (Laughing) I jog, at best, but he runs. So…
THERAPIST: So you're going for a jog and he's…
CLIENT: Yeah, I know like, it would be really good to go together because you have someone, whatever, but I'm nervous because I think he's going to be faster and…
THERAPIST: I like that one better.
CLIENT: You like that one?
THERAPIST: Yeah, that's really easier to do.
CLIENT: It's probably easier.
THERAPIST: Okay, so at least one jog, and then make a list. This week, keep track of all the things that embarrass you…
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And that you've made some mistakes in. Okay?
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: So we can get our homework better.
CLIENT: All right, I will.
THERAPIST: Work up to that Portuguese.
CLIENT: Yeah, this is good. I think this is - I have a lot of these issues, so…
THERAPIST: So practice. You remember that statement?
CLIENT: Yeah, "I would like to be - I would like to not make mistakes, and I can try my best, but if I don't - if I do make mistakes I can accept myself."
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. (laugh) okay, I think we did some good work, today.
CLIENT: Yeah, thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay, so I will see you next Thursday.
CLIENT: Next Thursday. Okay, by.
THERAPIST: Have a good week…
