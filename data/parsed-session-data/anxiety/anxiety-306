A FEW hours delving into the accounts the following
morning and a comparison between the takings and
the outgoings and I was quickly apprised of the state of
financial crisis to which I had returned. I struggled to
maintain my feeling of aloofness. But my brief review of
Max Colyer-Fergusson's period of management, then
of Chris's encounters with the Ascot racegoers, proved to
me satisfactorily, too satisfactorily, that it was no longer
possible to be dilettante about hotel-keeping.


Obviously, if I wished to rescue my capital I would
have to take personal charge. The joys of residence at our
pleasant cottage by the side of the wood at Bladon
became a thing of the past. I found myself glued to "The
Marlborough Arms" from before 9 a.m. in the morning
until after closing time at night—humouring and talking
to customers, anxiously watching that each and every
comer, however he or she had arrived, whatever his or
her social status, received his proper share of attention
from members of the staff.


"If only we could get some decent people in." The
words started to echo through my brain in spite of myself.


I am not a snob. May God, in Whose sight all creatures
are equal, forbid! What could be more tiresome, who are
more tiresome in fact, than the "intelligent, beautiful and
well-bred people" of the John Fothergill ideal? But, as
the succeeding weeks went by at "The Marlborough
Arms" one felt that at least there were minimum standards

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Uplifted by my belief in the equality of all men,
spurred by the profit-making (or more correctly loss-avoiding)
motive, I did my best to smother such feelings
as these and give the traditionally hearty welcome to all
Harry Gowing's valuable goodwill, pending the arrival
of "the decent people" we sought. However, I suffered
from the serious disadvantage for the owner of a pub with
a good racing connection that I did not know the name of
a single horse running on the Turf. And so when the
bookmakers called at five o'clock on their way back from
Ascot or Newbury or maybe Cheltenham, though I hung
about and did my best to try to be sociable and chatty,
the occasions were never a success. It was difficult to find
common ground for conversation and, despite my efforts
at fraternization, the bookmakers and I remained mentally
poles apart. I realized that they must have thought me
stand-offish. I even started to read the <i>Racing Times</i>
which was still delivered daily as one of the regular hotel
papers, but to remember the names of racehorses was a
mental effort to which I found myself unequal; and the
bookmakers soon ceased to call.


Then, too, the rosy-cheeked gentlemen from Birmingham
came in and sat down and looked pathetically ill at
ease. For Chris's cleaning demon had been at work and
the Gowings' hitherto snug dining room now, after
immense effort on her part, looked spick and span with
clean floor and dainty tablecloths.

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Where's old 'Arry Gowing gone?" was their invariable
query to be followed by the grudging comment, "Making
the place look nice, aren't you?"


All the same, the plaintive look of dissatisfaction could
be seen on their faces. This wasn't 'Arry Gowing's place
any longer. Where was good old 'Arry? Where was the
dear old dirt? The place wasn't the same. And they too
departed for good.


Meanwhile the good-class custom, "the decent people,"
were slow in filtering in. I even began to doubt myself.
Perhaps, I began to think, Max Colyer-Fergusson had
been right. Perhaps I was falling betweeen two stools in
the way in which "The Marlborough Arms" was being
run.


So much for the day. Then, after closing time came the
accounts; the accounts—and the bills. Night after night I
sat up late in the office trying to stretch these unrelenting
figures as if they were pieces of elastic in my endeavours
to close the ruinous gap between receipts and outgoings.
Trade receipts were, indeed, keeping up to the level of
those from the previous proprietorship. But as an offset
to this, not only were my running expenses much higher,
but there was a welter of other bills in addition. Bills for
refurnishing and refitting, bills for cutlery and glass, bills
for linen and kitchen utensils, and tea urns and coffee
urns, and all manner of contraptions which I had never
previously imagined but which Chris now declared were
the barest essentials for hotel catering. They were bills
for amounts that made my head reel when I thought of
them in relation to the total sum of my cash in hand, a
sum which also had to provide for the necessary structural
alterations.


Gradually, however, as the weeks passed, I got a grip
on the problems of hotel management. When it came to
the kitchen there was a certain amount of protest from
Chris. But I had another glance at the accounts and then

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My chief stand-by during this time was undoubtedly
our barman, Mr. Lovell. Mr. Lovell had appeared in
response to my original advertisement for a bar manager,
accompanied by unimpeachable references extending over
many years of experience in the licensing trade. There was
an element of mystery as to why, with a background of
responsible positions in hotels in big centres of population
up and down the country, Mr. Lovell was content with a
job of £2 a week in a country town hotel. Middle-aged,
of commanding presence, neatly-dressed, well-spoken in
somewhat supercilious fashion, with only a slight glassiness
about the eye, only a slightly unhealthy tinge about
his complexion, only a slight heaviness about the jowl,
Mr. Lovell managed to give the impression that he was
interrupting a series of important managerial appointments
specially in order to come and help us at "The
Marlborough Arms." And we left it at that. Not to have
engaged such an obvious paragon of bar-managership
would have been very wrong indeed. Certainly ever since
we had started with him at "The Marlborough Arms"
Mr. Lovell had shown a ruthless competence, not only
in his knowledge of his own job, but also in his freely-given
comments about other aspects of hotel-keeping.


In the strange circumstances in which I found myself
I clutched at Mr. Lovell's competence as a drowning
man clutches at a straw. Unfortunately he saw that I was
clutching. Accordingly as he sensed my dependence on

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Your menus may attract customers, sir. But they
wouldn't have done for me when I was manager of ‘The
Cock and Pheasant,’ Nottingham. No, sir!"


Lovell was a useful man to have about the place—for
the time being. But I had no fancy for occupying the role
of Bertie Wooster as a permanency.


However, the hotel ran. As, at the end of each week
I added up the accounts, gradually, the gap between
receipts and expenditure narrowed until at last something
—though not nearly enough—could be put aside for
overheads. The hotel was not making money, but I had
reconciled myself to losing money for a time—until such
time as we could put our reconstruction in hand. In the
meantime, by the beginning of July our preliminary
decorations were through. The outside of "The Marlborough
Arms" looked spick and span, if perhaps a
little amateurish, with a fresh coat of white distemper
covering the chipped green paint on the lower part of its
frontage, a line of red-painted tubs containing evergreen
shrubs, boxes of geraniums brightening the window-sills,
and the new sign of a stage-coach and four painted by our
artist friend, Valda Vaughan. The more glaring of the
internal defects had been glossed over a coat of sunshine-yellow
distemper—pending the putting in hand of the
major structural alterations; while "decent customers"
were starting to show themselves by ones and twos.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I surveyed the prospect at the commencement of
the August touring season, hope glimmered fitfully in
front of me.

"I say, we're starting your job on Tuesday," came the
breezy voice of our architect, Bill Daft, over the phone.


"My God, you're not!" I said. Tuesday of all days!
It was the Tuesday following Bank Holiday. We would
have the hotel upside down for the busy motoring season.


"My God we are!" declared Bill Daft. "Listen to me,
if you want your new dining room by the winter, Cousens
has got to start now. It's no good starting to knock holes
in your place in winter weather. You won't have a customer
left. If you want to postpone the work until next spring
then you can do so. But you'll have your Bank Holidays
being interrupted then too."


It was Hobson's Choice. Ever since, with the assistance
of Bill Daft, we had first planned our reconstructions we
had been impatiently awaiting the decisions of Committees,
County Planning Officers, Highway Authorities,
<i>et alia</i>, on our brain child. All our difficulties would be
smoothed out when we got our alterations through, so
we had consoled ourselves throughout the summer.
However, our impatience was succeeded not so much by
satisfaction as by-consternation when we heard the news
that the builders intended to start their operations during
August Bank Holiday week.


So, following the initial chaos of management problems,
there came on us the further chaos of structural
alterations. As the picks and crowbars of Mr. Cousens'
men got to work on the Dickensian beams and partitions
of "The Marlborough Arms" a fine powdery dust, the
accumulation of some two centuries of dust that had been
lurking in the nooks and crannies, pervaded the hotel.

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here were "decent people" at last and this was the
state in which we had to welcome them! They were all
very charming about it, but it was impossible to make
anyone feel at home. Friendly family parties en route for
holidays to the South Coast would call in and be enjoying
the unusualness of our improvised serving arrangements
when they would perhaps notice the fine scum of dust
floating on top of the beer and would feel that they had
to be getting on. Good-looking young ladies (duly
escorted, of course), whom one could have wished to have
stayed longer, would walk in and after sitting uneasily
amongst the chaos for a few minutes, would walk out
again with profuse apologies. Meanwhile we were losing
golden opportunities of making fresh customers.


Coincident with this was our other main problem.
The essential part of our reconstruction, the kernel of the
whole plan in fact, was the removal of the partitions that
formed the locals' snug, where they played their evening
card games, and the serving bar opposite and their
incorporation, together with Harry Gowing's passage
way where we had stood in our first entry, into a large
lounge. It was a solemn ceremony indeed when the last
hand of <i>Misère</i> was played out. Then the next day the
panels were down and the snug was opened to the four
winds of heaven.


What would the locals do? The feeling of anxiety had
haunted us. Would they stay with us and adapt themselves

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the beginning of October—just too late alas, for the
holidaymakers—the last nail had been hammered in and
the last piece of wood had been painted and varnished.
As a result the hotel had a fine lounge, a good roomy bar,
while a new dining room and kitchen had risen at the back
of the hotel out of the appalling filth of Harry Gowing's
derelict stables. The battle with the structural defects of
"The Marlborough-Arms" was not over—it was still to
rage for many years to come. But at least in appearance
the hotel was pleasant, clean, civilised and comfortable.

Installed in our newly-reconstructed premises, we felt
we had done a good job. Our muddling start was over and
our hotel, accounts and everything, ran to a system. All
our original helpers had by this time gone into discard
and we had an entirely new staff. Even Max Colyer-Fergusson
had found the alterations to the establishment
interfering with his comfort and the staff likewise becoming
increasingly inattentive to his wants and had departed.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A yet sadder end had come to Mr. Lovell. The <i>tendo
Achillis</i> of this paragon was, alas, ultimately revealed as
being connected with his professional activities. Any
suspicions about this, to start with, depended entirely
upon the slight relaxation that occasionally occurred in
his haughty demeanour late at night. It was only when,
one Saturday midday, the mollifying effect of his imputations
had set in earlier than usual and, as a result of this,
he started to refuse legal tender in return for his wares,
that the crisis came. The cry of "Free drinks at the
Marlborough" that spread around the town of Woodstock
was the sensation both of that day and many days to
come. Chris and I were out of the hotel when this was
happening and apparently it was only the complete
physical and mental collapse of our paragon that put an
end to this generosity at our expense. When I returned to
the hotel after the morning's shopping expedition I found
that our "direct labour" jobbing decorator, George, had
fortunately taken the conduct of the bar into his competent
hands. A brief interchange of notes occurred between
myself and Mr. Lovell on his bed of sickness upstairs and
George had the job.


So we faced the future. All we had to do, we felt, was
to sit back in our renovated premises and watch the
customers come in.


We were soon to find, however, that the physical
transformation of "The Marlborough Arms" was one
thing: its spiritual transformation was quite another.
Chris and I sat opposite each other in the corner table by
the kitchen door in our new dining room with its tasteful
brass chandeliers and wall brackets and grey hide-backed
chairs. But we sat alone. It was the middle of November
and for several evenings there had been no one in to
appreciate our new furnishings. Instead of the hub-bub
of a dining room full of guests which was our aim, we sat
listening to the noise in the bar along the passage. It was

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We had been apprehensive about our local custom
during the time of our alterations, as I have mentioned.
But we need not have worried. Here and there a unit of
the original goodwill may have taken umbrage. But any
such as Mr. W. was amply compensated for by the new
bar custom that, attracted by the glamour of the reconstruction,
started to flood in from all parts of the ancient
borough. The dining room and the residential part of the
hotel remained empty, but night after night the bar and
to a lesser extent the lounge were full of a milling throng
of these friendly, noisy people.


Enthusiastic sponsor of this movement was our new
barman (ex-decorator) George. George, a native of
Liverpool, took the responsibilities of his position
seriously. In his Lancastrian fashion he had taken us
under his wing and he meant to make the place "go" for
us. In pursuance of this he had adopted the simple
expedient of making friends round the pubs and inducing
his pals to come in and partake of the new facilities at
"The Marlborough Arms."


He had, on the evening of which I am now writing,
just made the <i>coup</i> of bringing in a darts-playing school
from "The Queen's Own" down the road—for whose
benefit he had persuaded me against my better judgment
to install a special brand of mild beer, 1d. a pint cheaper
than our usual bitter. Now, as we sat alone in our new
dining room, we could hear the Liverpudlian accents of
Barman George yelling greetings to his pals from "The
Queen's Own" being echoed by those of Customer Jack
shouting boisterous encouragement in basic English,
Oxfordshire fashion, to his partners at the darts board.
"Put the b——- b——- right in the b—— centre of the
b——- board," boomed out the voice of Customer Jack.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The pastel-tinted lampshades of our dining room
chandeliers quivered with the vibration of each of the
words beginning with b——- that disturbed their delicate
primness.


Chris and I looked at each other.


"You're a fool, darling," said Chris.


"Why?" Though I had some idea what Chris meant.


"Well," said Chris, "we didn't make the place for these
people."


"I expect you'd rather have it empty," I protested.


"Well, look at this," said Chris. "You're not going to
pay for these decorations on mild beer at 6d. a pint."


She was right—we had had no one in for an evening
meal since the Woodstock Badminton Club had come in
for bacon and eggs three evenings ago.


I looked at Chris and Chris looked at me, but neither
of us spoke. This had been yet another argument. The
changed circumstances of hotel life had had its effect on
us. But not in the manner that I had hoped. At first it
had seemed to give us welcome variation from each other's
company. It had become a convenient custom that while
one went out, the other should stay in and look after the
hotel. But the natural outcome of this was that, after
some six months, far from the work bringing us together,
we began to see things more differently than ever. Now as
I looked at Chris I felt that she was altering. She had
altered. Even though we were by ourselves, here she was,
dressed in showy, exotic fashion. A different Chris from
the simple nurse at the Metropolitan Hospital whom I
used to know.


For myself I admitted that perhaps I had altered too.
But not in the same way. I have, during this autobiography,
made no attempt to hide my faults. But it is not
one of my weaknesses to succumb to any craze to doll
myself up. My own tendency was, always has been and
still is, to go about in grey flannels, soft-collared shirt and

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, in between the various crises which I have
described, had passed many an hour in peaceful, even
fashion. It was only the obstinate sense of truancy that
obtruded itself with increasing insistence into these
mentally-restfu pursuits—the uncomfortable feeling at
the back of my mind that I ought not to be doing this,
but something else—that failed to make me wholly
content with my lot, and drove me on to undertake other
tasks. So it was that, through the promptings of a professional
conscience which I had not hitherto known that
I possessed, I had found myself early in October interviewing
the kindly, if slightly inscrutable, personality
of Professor Le Gros Clark in the Anatomy Department
of Oxford University and asking for a job—a parttime
job, of course—that I could fit in with my hotel
ties.


Thus, having spent a lifetime up to this date in attempts
to escape from the medical profession; and having at last
succeeded in my main object, I now started to put

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All the same, I was grateful, still am grateful, to "the
Professor" for the job which he gave me. My Demonstratorship
in Anatomy was not much of a job for money,
but it gave me the personal prestige of a connection with
the University; it gave me variation from the often squalid
worries of hotel-keeping; it helped me also to delve
back into my memories and to retrieve, and indeed in
part to satisfy, my unfulfilled desires for continued
academic contact that I had felt when I had finished my
undergraduate days at Cambridge. The two years that I
lived in Woodstock between 1937 and 1939 would indeed
have been less full, less happy, if I had not held my
Anatomy Department appointment.


I had got this job on the strength of my Anatomy
qualifications of fifteen years previously and had embarked
on it in somewhat light-hearted fashion. But it was a
source of dismay to me to find to what extent I had
forgotten my once-very-considerable store of anatomical
knowledge acquired over some three years of my student
life.


"I'd like you to help me on the os <i>innominatum</i>, sir."


The scene was the Anatomy Department and this was a
dreadful moment. Not only was I entirely unaccustomed
hitherto to being called "Sir", but here I was at the same
time with the foolish feeling as if of staring an old familiar
friend in the face and failing to recognize him—and of
being an impostor as an anatomy demonstrator to boot.
For, it had completely slipped my memory what the
os <i>innominatum</i>—the largest bone in the body that
duplicates itself to form the pelvic girdle—was!

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My prestige in the anatomy department could afford
no repetition of such an incident as this.


I had to start relearning my anatomy with the same
intensity as I had done in my early twenties. Each evening
after our solitary dinner Chris and I, by-passing the
yelling mob in the bar, would make our way into the
quiet of the panelled residents' lounge where, while the
"sixpenny milds" raged furiously together, I would sit
pondering on the relations of the median nerve or the
course of the branches of the <i>dorsalis pedis</i> artery, while
Chris would express her restiveness with this form of
evening amusement in a variety of ways.


So passed my first year as an hotel-keeper. It was not
one of outstanding success for me. I was, as Christiane
had suggested, making no money on "sixpenny mild"—in
fact, it was disappointing that, after our trouble, our
results were so slow in showing themselves. I was, likewise,
spending time and mental energy on a poorlyrewarded
pursuit in the Anatomy Department. But all
this was offset by the feeling that I was at last master of
my own fate.


Moreover, hotel-keeping and anatomy demonstrating
might be stop-gap occupations, but illuminating them
both was the bright star of my political fortune.
