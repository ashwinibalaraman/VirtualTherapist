Reluctantly, I went back to see Amanda.


I had not expected to see her again, though I sent her cards from
time to time. I wanted her to know how well I was doing. To return
was an admission of failure. If it had come to this, I thought, it was
time to declare surrender, to admit that I was sick. But this grudging
admission was not a step toward understanding; it was a badge of
shame. If I was sick in the mind, it was not a kind of sickness anyone
would want to own up to.


It was the early spring of 1986, and Amanda had moved to a new
office, with several new doctors in practice with her. But though the
location might change, nothing in her office ever seemed to; it was
always the same tasteful sofa and chairs, the same pastel Impressionist
prints on the walls. She sat across from me, waiting serenely for
me to speak. Her expression seemed to say: <i>I expected this</i>.


"I'm ready for drugs," I told her, and that was a sign of my desperation;
I had always considered this a remote last resort. "If you
can't prescribe them, I want you to refer me to somebody who can."
She left the room and returned with a psychiatrist from an office
down the hall. He listened to my recitation, and asked me what
drugs my internist had prescribed for me years before, and in what
dosage. Triavil, I said. I couldn't remember the exact dosage, but I
remembered what the pills had looked like, and how many I had
taken every day.


"No wonder!" he snorted. "You weren't getting enough antidepressants
to cure the blues in a cocker spaniel." He prescribed
imipramine, at somewhere around the standard therapeutic dose

[p. <i>88</i>]

After a few weeks, it seemed that the imipramine was helping.
My moods stabilized; the constant mental ache subsided. Life seemed
to flow more easilydisappointments did not seem as disastrous,
loneliness not as terrible. At the same time, at Amanda's urging, I
began attending the group therapy sessions once a week, in conjunction
with my individual sessions.


The group varied over the three years or so I spent in it, but it
averaged around ten or twelve people. With one or two exceptions,
none of whom lasted very long, the members were all middle-class
women, ranging from their early twenties to their fifties. Our job
was to interact with each other, to create some kind of working family
unit in which we could hold our behavior up to scrutiny; the sessions
were to be an exercise in exploring and changing the behaviors
that caused us trouble. Most of thosepassivity, manipulativeness
in relationships, deep cravings for approvalwere in abundant evidence.
Since most of the participants had sought therapy in the first
place to deal with depression, it seems likely to me now, in retrospect,
that these traits in many instances were habits inculcated by
years of coping with chronic depression.


Yet, once again, the basic therapeutic assumption was that those
behaviors were not symptoms of a problemthey <i>were</i> the problem;
depression, on the other hand, was a symptom, not an illness. I never
heard anyone mention the fact that chronic depression could affect
memory, or that there were specific techniques that could assist in
unlearning bad habits. If anyone had, I probably would have discounted
the information as "gimmicky." After all these years, I was

[p. <i>89</i>]

The result was a real-life illustration of the old joke: we had
learned from our mistakes and could repeat them exactly. Whole sessions
were devoted to exploring which of the women in the room
were cozying up to Don, the male therapist, and what they sought in
a father figure. Others sessions, in which Amanda and I frequently
played leading roles, re-created tensions in mother-daughter relationships.
There was a lot of venting. Sometimes it seemed to me
like we were each a part of one big human pipe organ, piping the
same notes whenever somebody hit us in the right spot. In the end,
we learned much about each other's quirks, but not much about how
to actually feel better.


Sometimes I felt like some creature caught in a net, thrashing
around and unable to get free. I didn't know what the net was, but I
knew it was there; I didn't know what was standing between me and
deep connections with other people, but that was there too. I felt it
distinctly. It was a wallthe same wall I had told my mother about
when I was a child. I couldn't get around it, or over it. It was just
there.


Years later, Ray Fuller, the scientist at Eli Lilly, told me about an
experiment measuring neurotransmitters in damselfish. The damselfish
were kept in tanks and separated from their natural predator
fish by only a glass wall. They thought they were about to be eaten.
After a time, levels of certain neurotransmitters in their brains
notably serotoninshowed a marked decrease. It was illustrative in

[p. <i>90</i>]

I look back now and see myself as one of those damselfish. My
self-image was rooted in how I thought of myself when I was
depressed. I had many friends, but I was still lonely. I wanted psychotherapy
to help; I wanted to be as good at it as I had been at my
work in school. But I wasn't. Here I was, ten years out of college and
still in remedial training for life. One by one, my friends had begun
to get married, buy houses, have babies. Wouldn't any normal person
have graduated from therapy by now? Even in good times, I thought
of myself as having a secret flawso I looked for the thing that
would make me whole: a career achievement, a man who was smarter
and more powerful. Ordinary, decent guys, who felt no urge to get
involved in a confined and clinging relationship, I usually dismissed
as boring. Once or twice, I pursued men who fit this description, but
found they avoided romantic entanglements with me. This I took as
further proof of my defectiveness.


And yet, overall, things began to change. The changes were slow
and visible only in hindsight. They had begun, in fact, with my decision
to apply for the fellowship to Yale two years earlier. But now, in
1986, the changes began to acceleratethough I find it impossible
to trace this to any one factor. Age had something to do with it. I
was now thirty-one; simply living for some time on my own had
given me a degree of emotional maturity I had lacked before, which

[p. <i>91</i>]

One day I decided, for no reason I could name, that I was going
to learn how to swim. This was something that had always terrified
me. My dad had tried to teach me to swim, and had failed. His
method was to hold me up by the seat of my swimsuit and put my
face in the water while yelling, "Okay, now, kick!" Several gallons
of water had gone up my sinuses before I persuaded him to let me
quit, and the experience left me with a lasting phobia about putting
my face in the water. Some years later, my mother had taken my sister
and me to the community swimming pool, where the instructor
had employed a different pedagogical technique. His method was to
get us to blow bubbles for about ten minutes in the shallow end,
then take us down to the deep end and have us jump in. If we made
it to the side of the pool without having to be rescued, the lesson
was deemed a success. From him, I learned how to hyperventilate
when I got into water over my head.


Signing up for swimming lessons, then, was a sign of something.
I had survived Yale, despite my loneliness; I had even discovered I
was not an impostor there. Now I felt ready to tackle other frightening
tasks. And though learning to swim might have sounded small
to other people, it was a profound experience. It made me, for the
first time, confront an ingrained behavior, rooted in a powerful emotion,
and taught me how to change it through the deliberate, conscious

[p. <i>92</i>]

The first step was elemental: I had to put my face into the water.


Whenever I tried, I felt starved for air. The instant my head went
below the surface, I felt a powerful need to inhale and fill up my
lungs. The thought of exhaling and losing what air I had was terrifying.
Whenever I tried, I found myself coming up, gasping and
coughing, with water up my nose. No amount of reason or pep talks
helped; the only thing that worked was to just do it. Afterwards, I
had to spend several minutes calming an impulse to hyperventilate,
but when that had subsided I tried it again, this time twice. Then
four times. It took a long time for the panic to subside. While the
rest of the class was moving on, I stayed off to myself and dunked
20, 40, 75 times. Eventually, at 150 dunks, I was comfortable
enough to move on.


Now I had to coordinate breathing with kicking, which we did
by hanging on to a kickboard. Then we discarded the kickboards and
tried coordinating our arm strokes. Gradually, I realized I was swimming.


The next step was treading water, which proved to be relatively
easy. Then, on our fifth or sixth lesson, the YMCA instructor took us
down to the deep end for the first time. We were going to learn to
dive, he said. The first step was to jump in, feet first, come to the
top, and then tread water. Looking at the pool, at my classmates
stepping up gingerly to the edge, I felt ready to cry. My chest felt
tight. Fear edged at my brain like the cold puddle of water lapping

[p. <i>93</i>]

Swimming lessons at the Y also, for the first time, put me with
people groping with the same kind of fear, facing it in their own
way. It taught me I was not special, or alone. Most, like me, were
fighting phobias dating back to childhood. One of my classmates was
a young man who had signed up for the Coast Guard. <i>That</i>, I
thought, was a brave person.


I finished the beginners' course and signed up for Intermediate
Swimming. In between lessons, I started trying to swim laps. At the
end of six months, I was diving headfirst into the deep end and
swimming a complete lap before I had to stop to catch my breath. I
had conquered the water; from here on in, it was going to be a matter
of getting into shape. It was like opening windows and sweeping
out rooms in a musty house. It was exhilarating.


And then, in November 1986, another thunderbolt struck: the
Prince of Fucking Darkness announced his retirement.


Even more sensational was the news of who the paper's rich-old-lady
owners had offered the job of executive editor to: Bill Kovach,
then Washington bureau chief of the <i>New York Times</i>. Bill who? I
immediately called my friend Robin, who had left Atlanta the year
before to work for the <i>Times</i> in Washington.


"We just heard about it," she moaned. "He's a wonderful editor.
We're just sick about losing him."

[p. <i>94</i>]

We weren't sick; we were delirious with joy. "All my life I've
wanted to go to the <i>New York Times</i>," one of my colleagues said, "and
now the <i>New York Times</i> is coming to me."


Days went by, while the office rumor mill ran faster than the
presses downstairs. It was a done deal. Well, almost a done deal.
They were negotiating over money. No, money was not an issue.
Then we heard the deal was off; Kovach was negotiating to have control
over the Atlanta newspaper's Washington bureau as well, the
owners had refused, and that was that. It wasn't going to happen.


I heard this news at the water cooler, and for a moment I felt,
vividly, what Robin must have been feeling a day or so earlier when
she said she was "sick." Then, moved by one of those impulses that
make no sense, and end up changing your life, I put on my coat and
walked out the door.


It was a gray, cold November day. I walked down the block
without seeing anyone I knew, turned the corner, and ducked into
the grimy little Western Union office, which catered mostly to working-class
people who needed to wire cash. What I had in mind was
impossible and corny; it was even a little risky, because the Prince
of Fucking Darkness was not kind to underlings who were insubordinate
or critical. But I felt compelled anyway. I had the <i>New York
Times</i> address in Washington in my purse, because it was where I
mailed letters to Robin. I sent Kovach a telegram. The message was
brief, and I did not sign my name; even more than I wanted a new
boss, I wanted not to get fired.


"There are a lot of talented people here who want to work for a
good editor," I wrote. "Please come."


Two days later, it was official: Kovach had taken the job. For a
moment, I felt a sharp, unreasonable joy. Then I calmed myself.
Amanda was frequently telling me that I was narcissistic, insensitive

[p. <i>95</i>]

Kovach came to Atlanta and ran the paper for two years. His
arrival was not greeted with general elation. Atlanta is a businessman's
town, a Chamber of Commerce milieu which does not take
kindly to the sort of disrespectful, kick-ass journalism practiced in
cities like Boston, Chicago, or New Yorkwhich was, of course, the
sort of journalism Kovach was interested in. Atlanta sees itself less as
a part of a larger world than as a regional capital"Capital of the
New South" is its sloganand foreign news or big-picture stories
about national trends only served to remind the city's leaders that
they were simply big fish in a medium-sized pond. Some people
started calling us the Southern edition of the <i>New York Times</i>, and
that was no compliment. <i>Bo</i>-ring, they said, looking at Sunday stories
that were twice the length they used to be; <i>bo</i>-ring, they said,
their eyes glazing over at in-depth pieces about places they had never
heard of in Africa. The old-timers muttered darkly about Yankee carpetbaggers.
Well-known columnist Lewis Grizzard, who had been a
protg of the Prince dating back to the time they were sportswriters
together, resigned with a flourish one night in a bar, bought several
cases of Dom Perignon to celebrate, then changed his mind, came
back, and tried to put the champagne on his expense account. I don't
think so, Kovach said, and Grizzard had to ante up himself. He was
incensed; this was not the good ol' boy code he knew. Eventually,
Grizzard stopped coming to the office, preferring to file his columns
from home rather than deal directly with Kovach and the corps of
<i>Times</i>men he had brought in. The <i>Journal-Constitution</i>, that venerable

[p. <i>96</i>]

It was a doomed enterprise. To ask somebody like Kovach to run
a newspaper owned and published by such deeply conservative
Chamber of Commerce boosters was like inviting H. L. Mencken to
go to work for George F. Babbitt. But for a while, it was exhilarating.
Unlike the Prince, Kovach liked being in the newsroom, liked
talking to us. "Good story," he would say briefly in passing, and his
praise was remarkable in a corporate culture which had allowed initiative
to go unrewarded for years. Unlike the Prince, Kovach made
eye contact with people when he talked; he made jokes and laughed
at other people's jokes. He was, in short, human. A craggy-faced man
with prematurely white hair, he had a twangy eastern Tennessee
accent that often made people forget that he was, in fact, the son of
Albanian immigrants. There were rumors that he had a violent temper,
which I suspected was true; growing up with my father had
given me extensive experience with people who masked their ferocious
depths under a veneer of charm. I liked him, but I would not
have liked to cross him.


His arrival, and the personnel changes he began to make in management,
quickly had a discernible effect on morale. People stopped
taking two-hour lunches and spending great chunks of the day e-mailing
messages to their friends. The number of whispered conversations
people surreptitiously trying to line up job interviews at
other papersdropped precipitously. Suddenly, there was work to
do; we had a paper to put out.


In the past, reporters had tended to steer clear of certain topics
for fear of writing about them in a way that might offend the Prince.
It wasn't so much that he had an array of sacred cowsit was just
that he was so enigmatic, and so occasionally ruthless, that nobody

[p. <i>97</i>]

Now there were interesting things going on all around: a series
on discrimination by Atlanta banks against blacks who applied for
home loans; firsthand reporting on the famine in the Sudan; some
incendiary editorial cartoons by a new person Kovach had hired,
Doug Marlette; an investigation into the state's foster care system; a
series about how indigent black defendants fared in a rural judicial
circuit in east Georgia.


The last effort was mostly mine, though a colleague, Larry
Copeland, helped to report and write one of the five stories. I had
embarked on the project in the summer of 1987, and it had taken
me four months to research. The stories ran in December 1987, and

[p. <i>98</i>]

In March 1988 there was more news: the rumor mill had my
series on the short list for a Pulitzer.


I had never paid close attention to the Pulitzer announcements
before. They were like the Nobel Peace Prizeinteresting, newsworthy,
and just about as likely as a Nobel to be a matter of personal
significance. But on that day in March 1988, the newsroom was
wired. Nobody was doing any work; everyone was glued to a computer
terminal, waiting for the Associated Press to move the names
of the winners. At a little past noon, Kovach came in the newsroom,
with Marlette in towand it was official: Marlette had won, for editorial
cartooning. It was the first Pulitzer the paper had brought
home since 1961. There were four runners-up from Atlanta in other
categories, including my series, in the category of investigative
reporting.


"You were robbed," growled my boss, Sonny Rawls, but I was
overjoyed. Seven years earlier, when the <i>Constitution</i> had hired me, I
had mentally outlined my career goals. One had been to get a
Neimann fellowship for journalists at Harvard, and I had managed
something comparable by going to Yale. The other had been to win
a Pulitzer, though this had seemed so unlikely that I had never told
anyone. Now, I had almost done itand in truth, almost winning

[p. <i>99</i>]

The end of the Kovach era came exactly two years after his
arrivalin November 1988. I was sitting at my desk when an e-mail
message flashed on my computer screen. It was from my editor:
"Bad news: Kovach just quit."


Even more stunning was the reason: an ancient bit of office
intrigue, the old dispute about control over the paper's Washington
bureau. Kovach wanted it; he argued that the Washington bureau
was poorly run, and that he could do a better job. That morning, for
whatever reason, the subject had come up again in a discussion
Kovach was having with the publisher, who had backed the bureau's
longtime chief. And this time, thwarted again, Kovach had quit
blown up in one of his infamous rages and walked out of the publisher's
office without another job to go to. Looking at those words on
my computer screen, I knew instantly: <i>This means I will have to leave
Atlanta</i>.


A group of us formed a delegation and drove over to his house to
try to talk him out of quitting. When we got there, he was sitting in
his living room with his wife, Lynne, and it was soon apparent that
he was fixed in his purpose, as inflexible in his way as the newspaper's
owners were in theirs. "I am either going to make this work or fly it
into the mountain," he had told the <i>Washington</i> Post two years earlier,

[p. <i>100</i>]

After a while people stood up, preparing to leave.


"You know," Kovach said unexpectedly, "I almost didn't take
this job. But one of the things that changed my mind was that I got
several anonymous telegrams from you people while I was still in
Washington." I felt my face get hot.


"One of those was from me," I said to him, in the general murmur
of people getting their coats and edging for the door.


He grinned. "Yeah," he said. "I thought so."


I let a few weeks go by before I called him up again. We met for
lunch at a downtown cafe. "I have decided I don't want to stay at the
paper anymore," I said.


"I'm glad to hear you say that," Kovach said. "Let me talk to
some people."


A few days later, my phone rang. An unfamiliar woman's voice
identified its owner as a recruiter for the <i>Washington Post</i>.


"We would like to talk to you."


Kovach's phone call to Ben Bradlee had been well timed: the Post
had an opening for someone to cover federal court, the same beat I
had covered for the Atlanta paper. I sent them my clips, and went
through the <i>Post</i>'s agonizing interviewing processtwo trips to
Washington, each for day-long meetings. On my first trip, I was ushered
into Bradlee's office, a glass-enclosed space with a panoramic
view of the <i>Post</i>'s newsroom on one side and the <i>Post</i>'s parking lot on
the other. Bradlee was exactly like his pictures, only more sogray-haired,
with a big booming voice and a chest to match. He had the
aristocrat's habit of saying exactly what came into his head; clearly,
this was not a man who worried about offending people. He asked
me why I'd had a co-author on one part of my series about the rural

[p. <i>101</i>]

"Yeah," Bradlee said, grinning at me. "And you are rather
white."


"Real, real white," I agreed, grinning back. "Pale, even." Looking
at Bradlee's splendid winter tan, I thought briefly about the
weirdness of the American caste system, in which skin that is dark
chocolate makes a person "black," while skin that is too pale makes
someone else a "redneck prole." Len Downie, Bradlee's managing editor,
sat off to one side during this exchange, looking vaguely dismayed
at this display of bad taste. At that moment, Bradlee made me think
of Tigger in <i>Winnie-the-Poob</i>pure brashness. "Hi!" he seemed to be
saying. "I'm a Boston Brahmin! Who are you?" I liked him.


Another long day of interviews followed, and by the end of that
I was almost convinced that they didn't want mebut no: the Post's
federal beat was offered to me a few weeks later. There was never any
doubt I would accept their offer, but the leave-taking was wrenching.
It was like stepping off a cliff, a worse feeling by far than learning to
dive into the deep end. I wondered if this was what had happened to
Fay Joyce. Had she been seduced by the offer of more prestige and
more money? I had heard many times that the <i>Washington Post</i> and
the <i>New York Times</i> were snake pits where only the strong and cunning
survived. Could I survive? Could I move to a completely new
city and find my way? In Atlanta, at least, I had my support system.
My friends were there, and so was Amanda. I had been back in therapy
for a little over two years now, going to group once a week and to
individual sessions with Amanda roughly once a month. I wasn't taking
imipramine anymoreI had quit taking it after less than a year,

[p. <i>102</i>]

"You are the only person I know," she said, "who could turn a
job offer from the <i>Washington Post</i> into a major personal tragedy."


And so, in April 1989, a moving van came and emptied my
apartment. A few days later, I packed up my car. The back seat was
occupied by a large cat carrier containing Ralph and Alice Kramden,
my tabby cats. The front seat was occupied by my sister, whom I'd
persuaded to help me with the driving. I had fantasies that we'd
make the trek up the east coast enjoying one long sisterly confab,
but in fact she hated cities and city drivinghated anything, in fact,
that forced her to deal with strangers. She had returned home after
college to live with our parents, and never left. Now she was thirty-five,
working as a hospital lab technician, and I had the distinct fear
that I was abandoning her, that she might never venture beyond the
tight little orbit she had created for herselfan orbit even narrower
than the one I had created for myself, and which I was now leaving
with such ambivalence. My fears about her turned out to be unjustified;
within the next two years, she would move into a place of her
own, move into a better job, and marry a wonderful man. But at the
time, I was afraid, and guilty at what I was doing to her. She was
afraid and guilty tooafraid of the city we were going to, guilty at
not wanting to give the help I asked her for.


We made the trip mostly in prickly silence, with Ralph and
Alice waking from their drug-induced drowsiness at intervals to yowl
