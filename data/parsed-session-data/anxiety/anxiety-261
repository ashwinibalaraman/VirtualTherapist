The door of the train compartment opens abruptly. I turn my head
without lifting my eyes from the floor. I see four black boots, meticulously
shining and ominously familiar. What now? I could keep my eyes down,
for I suspect I already know who these people are. Instead my glance
wanders upward and I see black breeches, gray tunics with shoulder
stripes, one embroidered eagle atop one swastika on each left sleeve, two
faces shaded by peaked, gray caps decorated with eagles perching above
skulls.


These uniforms tell me that my two travelling companions are officers
of the SS (<i>Schutzstaffel</i>), Nazi storm troopers who actively harrass,
torture and kill Jews. The shoulder stripes indicate that the man on the
right is a major and the one on the left a lieutenant. Both officers are
tall, slim, and muscular, with athletic but graceful movements. They sit
down on the bench facing me.


The lieutenant's face is long and narrow, with strong cheek bones,
thin lips and a small nose. He wears rimless glasses covering blue and
somewhat watery eyes. His skin is very light and covered with barely
visible freckles. He looks meticulous and intellectual. His age is about
thirty.


The major must be close to fifty years old. As he removes his cap,
I see that his head is bald and shiny except for some ash-blond hair, beginning
to gray, which forms a semicircle on the back of his head. His nose
is long, sharp, and curved, like that of an eagle, and his eyes are so narrow
that it is hard to discern their color. He too is pale, as though he
had not been exposed to the sun for a long time.

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My heart beats so loudly that I feel these SS officers will hear it. Then
I look through the window at the platform. It is empty. Please God, let
someone pass or some event happen down there so I can look away from
Hitler's elite guard and not be punished for it.


And then I hear, "Heisse Würstel, heisse Würstel!" Hot dogs! It
sounds more beautiful to me than the music of Mozart. The window is
already open so I shout, "Hier bitte!" (Here please), and the vending
woman asks, "Senf oder Kren?" (Mustard or horseradish?). When I say
"Mustard," she hollers "One mark." It is only now that I realize I won't
be able to pay because I only have the seven marks (three dollars) with
me that the German government permits Jewish refugees to take across
the border, and I'm not so foolish as to spend one-seventh of my entire
fortune on hot dogs. Instead I give the vendor my whole big sheet of
German stamps for the juicy food, saying, "Please take this." The lady
says, "That's too much," but I sit down without answering. Of what use
will German stamps be to me anyway after tonight?


When I sit down with my two hot dogs and a Kaiser roll, butterflies
float in my stomach. But when I see both Nazi officers engrossed in
reading <i>Der Völkische Beobachter</i>, the official Nazi newspaper, I begin
to eat and to plan. The trip from Vienna to Hamburg will take fifteen
hours. Should I move to another compartment? Should I read? Should
I bow to the inevitable conversation with these Nazis? I take my suitcase
from the rack, open it, and take out my detective novel. Then a jerk,
a hiss, steam blurring the window, and soon rattata, rattata, rattata — all
shake me from my novel, and the red slated roofs of Vienna, laundry
hanging limply on clotheslines, and a few dark flags with swastikas remind
me that my life as the only daughter of a wealthy Austrian family
has come to an end. I am fleeing the Nazis, I am journeying to America.
Will I make it? How will I ever manage to make it? Rattata, rattata,
rattata....


I return to my detective novel, <i>Wahnsinn (Madness)</i>, and read until
the middle-aged man, Werner, asks a beautiful widow, Hilde, to marry
him. The ticket collector enters. He punches our tickets and says,
"Hamburg," "Hamburg," "Hamburg." As the ticket man leaves, the major
begins to talk to me.


"Do you live in Hamburg?"


I look up and decide, instantaneously, that I will view his gesture
as small talk and not as an inquisition.

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No, I live in Vienna." The truth is, I should have said, "Tonight
I live nowhere."


"Do you have relatives or friends in Hamburg?"


"No, I don't know anyone there."


"Perhaps you are planning to get a job?"


"No, I am not planning to do that."


Now the lieutenant to the right adds, "I bet you are a tourist on vacation.
How long do you plan to stay in Hamburg?"


"Just for two hours. Then I shall catch a ship to Norway."


Both men sit up straight, chests out, bellies in. The major clears his
throat and says, "You must be on official business. Otherwise, being German,
you couldn't have got a permit to cross the border." (Vienna was,
at that time, a German town.)


My intuition says: tell the truth.


"No, I am not on official business. I am a Jewish refugee planning
to leave Germany and to settle in the United States. I hope to take a ship
from Hamburg to Norway tonight. Then I shall wait in Norway until my
quota number comes up—my official permission to enter the United
States. In all probability this will happen in March 1939."


The two men stare at me. Then the major says, "You don't look
Jewish."


"Most Jews don't look Jewish."


After a long silence the lieutenant asks, "Do you have relatives or
friends in Norway?"


"No."


"Do you speak Norwegian?"


"No."


"But you do have enough money to live comfortably until March?"


I do not know whether I should laugh or cry. "I have seven marks."


The two faces show disbelief, worry and guilt.


The major: "But you don't look like a poor woman."


"I left a fortune in Vienna, but, according to German law, refugees
cannot take more than seven marks out of the country."


Long silence.


I return to my book, Hilde finally marries Werner. Then I am
interrupted.


The major: "But what is going to become of you? Do you think you
can get a job in Norway?"

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No, I don't have the permission to work since I have only a visitor's
visa."


Silence.


Soon after Hilde marries Werner she begins to suffer hallucinations:
she sees her late husband, who was killed during World War I, standing
in front of her bed, with a bandage around his head, looking just as he
looked in the military hospital where she had visited him before his death.


I hear the two SS whispering to each other. Maybe I had better keep
my eyes fixed on the book. But the two men get up abruptly from their
seats and click their heels, so I look up.


"Please excuse us for being so rude. We have not even introduced
ourselves. This is Lieutenant Hans Dietrich, and I am Major Horst von
Schollenburg."


"My name is Edith Weisskopf."


They tell me they just cannot understand how a young woman can
survive without money and without the permission to work in a foreign
country from September 1938 to March 1939, and I find myself in the
strange position of having to comfort two Nazi officers, to assuage their
worries about me. I inform them that I am twenty-eight years old, older
than I look, and that there are Jewish aid committees in many places
bordering Germany, which I am sure will help me. What I do not tell them
is that whatever will happen to me in Norway is infinitely better than
whatever would happen to me in Germany.


In the short silence that follows, I look out the window and think
about the details of my recent journey. I left Vienna in a hurry. I knew
it wouldn't be difficult to cross the German border with respect to the
<i>German</i> authorities. They wanted to get rid of as many Jews as fast as
possible, before they decided to kill the six million who remained. But
if you step out of one country, you have to step into another country, and
the countries adjacent to Germany had closed their borders against the
onslaught of penniless refugees.


On a Wednesday in September, I had heard that a small Norwegian
ship shuttled daily from Bergen, Norway, to Hamburg, Germany, to enable
the people of Bergen to shop in the large city of Hamburg. This small
shipping line had never been used by refugees, since few people were
aware of its existence. Thus no arrangements had been made to identify
refugees and to deny them access to the ship. I packed my belongings,

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is impossible to stop them from being concerned. Soon the officers
interrupt my thinking to offer me, in their concern, the most moving yet
most politically naive of suggestions. For example, the lieutenant asks me
if I would take a small sum of money from him. Thus I <i>have</i> to explain
again that the problem is not that I do not have enough money, but that
<i>I cannot take</i> enough money across the German border, neither his money
nor my money.


Another moving but hair-raising suggestion: both men could accompany
me to the ship to make sure that the Norwegian border won't be
closed. I am planning to step on this ship very casually, trying hard not
to attract attention, as if I were a Norwegian on a shopping trip. But now
I see myself accompanied by two of the most conspicuously decorated,
uniformed Nazis! After I explain all this to them quite carefully and tactfully,
I return to my book. It turns out that Hilde's alleged hallucinations
were not so crazy. What she had seen had really happened. Her late husband's
double, with a bandage around his head, actually stood in front
of her bed, having been hired by her second husband, who was trying
to drive her insane so he could lay his hands on her money. The result:
a stiff prison sentence for Werner, and discharge from the hospital and
happiness for Hilde.


The whistle blows. We arrive in Hamburg.


I find myself suddenly saying, "Major von Schollenberg, Lieutenant
Dietrich, you are trying to help me, and it makes me sad that I must reject
your offers because you would put me and yourselves in danger. But you
have already helped me without knowing that you did. You have accompanied
me with love and concern to the border of your fatherland. Never
before has this happened to a Jewish person. But if you want to do one
more thing for me, please do whatever you can for the Jews who are left
behind. <i>Lebt wohl!</i> I shall never forget you." I try to grab my two large
suitcases, but the SS are faster and each of the officers grabs one.


"No, you must let me carry my own suitcases."


"But Fraulein, German officers won't let a lady carry her baggage."


What is the matter with these men? Don't they know they must not
be seen in public with a Jewess? I look at them firmly, almost angrily, and
say with a commanding voice, "From now on we won't be alone anymore.

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Jawohl, Fräulein."


Without looking back, I hurry to the end of the railroad car, holding
my suitcases as if they were my only link to life. When I reach the stairs
leading to the platform, I get some help from the conductor. Then I hurry,
following the crowd, out of the railroad station into the unknown city
of Hamburg. The next thing I remember is a stewardess showing me to
my cabin on a small Norwegian ship.


From the moment I left the train to the moment I entered the
Norwegian ship there lies an emotionally vast span of time during which
I must have passed through the German customs and the Norwegian
border, but these two most feared events are buried in complete
forgetfulness.


I am sitting on a hard bench in a waiting room at the harbor of Bergen.
It is 7:00 A.M., and cold rain is beating against the windows. The sun rises
late in Norway this time of the year. It is still pitch dark and will remain
dark for another two hours. My luggage is checked free of charge. I am
on my own.


As I sit in this dismal place without friends, without money, without
language, I begin to forget about German customs, crossing the Norwegian
border, being searched for valuables, even boarding the Norwegian ship:
I begin to allow blissful oblivion to swallow all of this. I feel enormous
elation engulfing every cell in my body as I sit in this waiting room. I
want to run, to sing, to stretch out my arms and embrace the air about
me. I am free! I won't have to fear torture, persecution, and concentration
camps. I am in a country where people talk to each other without
terror, where they smile, where they play, where they make music.


Intoxicated with the wine of freedom, as I sit in this dismal waiting
room I am seized by a sense of curiosity and adventure. I get up and run
across the room, then back to my bench again. Alone in the world for
the first time! Twenty-eight years old, pretty—perhaps beautiful—bright
and educated, with a doctor's degree in psychology. What will the future
bring? Why not stop worrying and simply jump into the whirl of a new
life and see where destiny will take me? Soon, however, the euphoria

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

First, I think I shall seek help from a Jewish emergency committee
for the rescue of refugees. Is there such a committee in Bergen? How big
a town is Bergen? How can I find out? Elementary, dear Edith! In the corner
of the waiting room is a telephone with a directory. The directory
is thin. Bergen is a small town. But it wouldn't do any harm to look under
"Jewish."


I open the book trying to find the word <i>Jüdisch</i>—how silly! <i>Jüdisch</i>
is the German word for Jewish, and what I need is the Norwegian word,
which I don't know. In most European languages, Jewish starts with a <i>J</i>.
Since it is only 7:30 and I have lots of time, I thumb through all the <i>J</i>'s.
There are three pages of Johansens, but I cannot find any word that could
possibly mean Jewish.


Another thought. They must have a rabbi in this town, and he could
certainly be of some help. My search is in vain. But here there is an interesting
name, Moshe Rabinowitz.


The time is now 9:00, it is beginning to get light, and I decide, fearlessly
and recklessly, to go and see Mr. Rabinowitz. I copy the address and
find my way by endless questioning: "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?" "Do you
speak English?" "Parlez-vous francais?" And if the answer is "ja," "yes,"
or "oui," I show my slip of paper with Mr. Rabinowitz's address and ask
for directions.


It is 9:30, and I stand in front of my destination—not a family home,
not an apartment building, but a huge department store. Could it be
that Mr. Rabinowitz is the owner of the store? I guess that the writing
on the front door says that the store will open at 10:00. I wait. Then I
enter and ask a salesgirl, "Moshe Rabinowitz?" When she realizes I cannot
speak Norwegian, she shows me the palm of her left hand and spreads
her fingers. I take this to mean that Mr. Rabinowitz's office is on the fifth
floor.


It is the top floor, and I have to walk through a huge room with a
blue wall-to-wall carpet and a multitude of desks with typing secretaries.
At the end of the room is a glass door with the inscription MOSHE
RABINOWITZ. I knock and enter. Another secretary, and behind her the
door to the inner sanctum. The secretary speaks English. "May I help
you?"

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I need to see Mr. Rabinowitz."


"Do you have an appointment?"


"No."


She examines her calendar. Then, with a smile, "Mr. Rabinowitz can
see you next Monday at 10 A.M."


Today is Thursday. How shall I eat and sleep Friday, Saturday and
Sunday?


I ask, "Is Mr. Rabinowitz in his office now?"


"Yes, but he is busy."


"Could you take a note to him right now?"


The secretary agrees reluctantly and hands me a pad of paper and
a pen. I wonder in what language I should write and decide German would
be my best choice. If he cannot speak German he can probably speak Yiddish,
and the two languages are so similar that he'll understand me.


The secretary calls, "Hialmar, Hialmar," and a teenaged boy takes my
note to the boss. Again, I feel the thrill of adventure rushing down my
spine. The note says:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I have just arrived from Germany. I am a Jewish
woman. Can you refer me to an emergency committee
for help?</i>
</p>
<p align="right">
<i>Edith Weisskopf</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
The phone on the secretary's desk rings almost immediately and, after
exchanging a few words over the phone, the woman says, "You may go in."


<i>I have just arrived from Germany. I am a Jewish
woman. Can you refer me to an emergency committee
for help?</i>


<i>Edith Weisskopf</i>


Mr. Rabinowitz turns out to be a short, stocky man of about forty.
He is not handsome but has an appealing smile and a good deal of warmth.
He asks me to take a seat and questions me with interest and skill about
my escape from Germany, about the living conditions of the German Jews,
about my family, and about my plans for the future.


In turn, I find that he and his brother own several department stores
and textile mills all over Scandinavia. I conclude he must be a multimillionaire.
He explains there is no emergency committee in Bergen and,
at the moment, he cannot give me any advice as to what I could do. "But
I am going to give it a lot of thought," he adds, "and I am sure we'll find
some solution."

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He has to stay in the store till 5 P.M. Would I be interested in resting
up in his home until then? His sister will be there and would see to it
that I am comfortable.


Pretty soon I sit in the back seat of a limousine, and a uniformed
chauffeur drives me to Mr. Rabinowitz's home. I feel like a figure in a
Hollywood movie. Too sleepy to take in the details of the home, I become
dimly aware of the general atmosphere—rich and ostentatious. The sister
is hospitable, but I tell her, "No, thank you, I am too tired to eat anything."
Pretty soon I fall asleep in a silk-and-ruffles bed, my last realistic thought
being that Mr. Rabinowitz is a widower who lives with his sister and his
twenty-year-old niece.


Five weeks later Mr. Rabinowitz asks me to marry him. My newly acquired
Norwegian friends congratulate me.


"How lucky you are! A poor woman all by herself in a strange
country and, whoops, she changes into a millionairess. Now you can
have everything you want—a Rolls Royce, a chauffeur, mink coats,
diamonds..."


Such little sermons cut deep into my heart, like a diamond itself, and
make me feel completely alone, as if suspended in space. I seem to be
able to get SS officers to worry about me, millionaires to propose to me,
and yet I am absolutely unable to present myself as the kind of person
I am. I couldn't care less about mink coats or diamonds. Not for one moment
do I consider marrying Mr. Rabinowitz. Surely I have always wanted
to get married, but mostly because society demands that women should
do so, because Mother and most other people would view me as a failure
were I to remain single, because I want to appear "normal" to Mother
and to others.


In order to achieve this disguise of marriage, however, I must marry
a suitable partner. And to Mother, that would mean only a well-educated,
cultured, intellectual man. And Moshe Rabinowitz is as far from that as
anyone I have previously known.


He came from a Polish ghetto to Norway about twenty years before
I met him. He had come with a pushcart from which he sold sundries.
Talented in enterprises, he eventually acquired department stores and textile
mills in Scandinavia. He still knew very little Norwegian. He spoke

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048377-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Quite some time ago, when I started to date during my late teens, I
worked out a strategy which I would use in case I wanted to marry someone
who did not measure up to my mother's standards. I would tell people
that I was in love, irrespective of whether I was or not. Being in love was
viewed as something positive. It could not eradicate lack of refinement
and culture, but it could soften the heavy blow of receiving a man of lower
status into the family. But, you see, even this strategy would not have
worked with Moshe because nobody would be able to believe that I could
fall in love with a man so different from myself. The difference in social
class and education would have made love, and even the pretense of love,
very difficult. So I told him no.


In February 1939 I was finally granted permission to enter the United
States.


Now I stand on board a ship and wave goodbye to Moshe. Another
goodbye, another tear. And behind my sadness something is pounding
within me, slowly making itself known. Soon I'll be in America. Soon
I'll have to be an adult. Soon I'll have to work in order to live, something
which, at the age of twenty-eight, I have never done before. The something
which is pounding within me is sheer, unadulterated terror.
