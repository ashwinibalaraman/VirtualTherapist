<b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b>
THERAPIST: So I understand you wanted to talk about some changes that you are thinking about making in your life, and you are—first about your health. So maybe I would like to hear about those.
CLIENT: Well I notice self care is, like, a really hard thing for me, because I am used to doing things for other people. So whether it's even, right, through my yoga, letting myself have a good cry, all just things to take care of myself, I feel really stuck about that. And I—it's very hard for me to just do those things consistently. Even though some things, like flossing my teeth? I'm great about flossing my teeth.
THERAPIST: That one you got down.
CLIENT: But the other ones don't come easily to me. And I don't let myself have them very much.
THERAPIST: And you have spent your life taking care of other people.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And now there are some things you want to do take care of yourself.
CLIENT: I do.
THERAPIST: And those are?
CLIENT: Well I think I said three really top ones. [0:01:01]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Which are eating in a more healthy way...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...doing my yoga practice and letting myself have a good cry sometimes.
THERAPIST: Those three. Okay. Okay. Well let's take a look at those maybe one at a time and where you are with each of those (inaudible at 0:01:19). You started with eating better.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And what are you doing in that regard?
CLIENT: In regard to eating better?
THERAPIST: And that's not—yeah. What changes have you made already?
CLIENT: (Laughs)
THERAPIST: And if it's done, it's okay. That's all.
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't think I've made changes.
THERAPIST: Okay. So it's just something you are thinking about that you probably ought to do but haven't really moved in that direction so far.
CLIENT: Not the way it would be much more sensible and good for me.
THERAPIST: Ah. What would be more sensible?
CLIENT: More salad, less crackers.
THERAPIST: So less on the carbohydrate end of things. [0:02:00]
CLIENT: Less on the carbohydrate end of things and more on the green veggies, you know, and things.
THERAPIST: More vegetables.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So very, very California.
CLIENT: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: I guess. But that's not been your pattern.
CLIENT: No. It hasn't.
THERAPIST: What are your—what kinds of things have you preferred?
CLIENT: Sweets and baked potatoes with butter.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, you know, that—those things.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's just like what you said—carbohydrate stuff.
THERAPIST: Standard American diet. Yeah. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So one change that you might choose to do would be to just move in the direction of choosing vegetables more often, carbohydrates less often.
CLIENT: Wouldn't that be sensible?
THERAPIST: Why would you do that? What's—what do you see as benefit to doing that?
CLIENT: Well I think I just would be more healthy in general. I think I would lose weight, and I think I would feel happier about myself and less ashamed. [0:03:02]
THERAPIST: So you'd feel better, maybe lose some weight in the process? And then there is also you carry a little shame around about this.
CLIENT: Large.
THERAPIST: You shouldn't be living in California eating carbohydrates around.
CLIENT: I certainly shouldn't.
THERAPIST: (Laughs) All right. And is this something that you have just started to think more about? Or has this kind of been lurking for quite awhile?
CLIENT: It's a real lurker.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So this is not the new issue.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Eating better then, nagging at you, but you haven't really changed anything yet.
CLIENT: No. I feel really stuck about it.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah.
CLIENT: And compulsive also.
THERAPIST: Compulsive also.
CLIENT: I can't just have, like, one cookie.
THERAPIST: Ah.
CLIENT: I overeat things that I shouldn't even be eating in the first place—or things that it would be fine to eat if I just had one or two.
THERAPIST: So what's that about? Having burped in the rule you might as well go all the way? Or... [0:04:03]
CLIENT: I don't know, really, what it's about. 
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: It just feels self destructive.
THERAPIST: Really. Destructive. Wow. Okay. So that's some of the feeling bad about it, that what I am doing...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...is doing myself in here.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah.
THERAPIST: And then yoga, you said,—you know, that's something you are doing to some extent.
CLIENT: Doing it to some extent. A couple of years ago I had a fall, and I have been pretty injured since then. So I want to move and stretch and stay flexible. So I have a yoga practice, but I don't do it very often. I did do it this morning because I was coming here.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So (chuckles) is there something...
THERAPIST: So you could tell me what it is.
CLIENT: (Laughs) If I could tell you I would.
THERAPIST: [I'm sure you would] (ph).
CLIENT: And tell myself.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it would just be great if—just the same as every single morning I get up and brush and floss my teeth and never think about it. [0:05:05]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: It would be good great if then I went downstairs and did my yoga practice and just, like, it was not a question or a, “I wonder if,” or, “Gee, well maybe I should.”
THERAPIST: Ah.
CLIENT: But if I just had it be as naturally woven in as flossing, that would be a great thing.
THERAPIST: Now how did you do that with flossing? What...
CLIENT: I have no idea.
THERAPIST: But it is. It's built right into your routine. So you just happen to automatically—you don't sit there trying to decide, “Shall I floss or not floss?”
CLIENT: Well now that you have asked about that, my whole mouth feels better if I get rid of, you know, the gunk.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: And so I feel better. But with the yoga practice it hurts because I'm in a lot of pain.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: So it's harder to think, “If I would do yoga regularly I would be strengthening those muscles and stretching those tendons and doing things that eventually would make it that maybe those things didn't hurt so much. Or even if they hurt I would be more flexible and stronger.” [0:06:09]
THERAPIST: So one thing I am hearing in common between the eating and this—and the yoga is that the change is one that would have a longer term benefit; but the short term says, “Let's just keep doing the same thing.” You know, this cracker tastes good or it hurts to do this yoga. So there is not the immediate benefit or...
(Crosstalking) 
CLIENT: No. Like, I do—like, do my e-mail or...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know, do the laundry or, you know, just do something else where there is a more seeable result.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Whereas yoga is very internal, and it's just for me. And I don't have anything really to show for it.
THERAPIST: Right away. Well, it's much—kind of delayed over a longer period of time. [0:07:02]
CLIENT: So they say. I don't know. I haven't seen the end result.
THERAPIST: Haven't done it long enough to find out, huh?
CLIENT: I haven't done it enough to find out.
THERAPIST: Now how did you get into yoga? You said you were injured.
CLIENT: I was injured and I—I think I went to Curves. You know, the exercise class for women?
THERAPIST: Yes. Yes.
CLIENT: And after my fall I couldn't do those things anymore.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And so one of my friends said, “Then yoga.” I said, “Oh, that would be a great thing.” And so I got a yoga teacher and she taught me a whole series of stretches, things to do for myself that would be good and wouldn't injure me further. So I typed them all up (chuckles). And it's great when that—you know, I feel better in my head when I have done them, that I have done them. I don't necessarily feel better in my body.
THERAPIST: But it's knowing that you have done something and...
CLIENT: Right. That's supposed to have a good effect on me. [0:07:59]
THERAPIST: On me, yeah. [It's a good cause, yeah] (ph). So that at least feels good even though physically you don't feel better...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...that you have just done the yoga.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So something that a friend suggested that you do. And you did get a teacher to help you...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...do it more. And it sounds like it didn't—hasn't ever quite gotten to the place where you would enjoy doing it.
CLIENT: I can't say it's a thrill. It's all right.
THERAPIST: It's all right.
CLIENT: Not as exciting as flossing.
THERAPIST: Wow. (Laughs) Flossing doesn't sound all that exciting. So that's kind of down there, huh?
CLIENT: I have—to me flossing feels good.
THERAPIST: And you immediately like the effect of it, you know. So...
CLIENT: Yeah. It's very immediate.
THERAPIST: So that would help if making one of these changes somehow had a—an immediate payoff or something that you felt better.
CLIENT: Right. So, like, just in my head I say, “Good for you Jean (sp?). Good job. You did that.”
THERAPIST: Yeah. That hasn't been enough to keep it going.
CLIENT: Unfortunately. [0:09:00]
THERAPIST: Or to be able—or to get it started with the [cool routine] (ph) that immediately happens, huh?
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You know, this third one you mentioned was having a good cry. And that sounds a little different. Tell me about that. Is there something about that that you have not been comfortable with? Or...
CLIENT: Well...
THERAPIST: What would you like to have happening here?
CLIENT: When I feel sad I would like just to be able to wash it through with a really good cry.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Because even though that doesn't change the circumstance—whatever it is that's going to hurt—it still is kind of an emotional cleansing...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...just washing that through with tears. And I used to have a lot of crying. And it used to come really easily to me. Or I remember when I was a kid I could just go to my bookshelf and read some certain chapter or some certain book that always touched me and would have me be in tears. And that could kind of like start me off, and then I could just have that sort of cleansing experience. [0:10:18]
But in the last five years or so I feel really shut down. Like, I feel really shut down emotionally. And I don't cry.
THERAPIST: What do you make of that?
CLIENT: Well one thing I make of it, it's just that—it's like a body noticing that I am not crying. It's like a body was then telling me, “Jean, you're really shut down. You need a miracle experience to...” You know. But I just think...
THERAPIST: Ah. [0:11:09]
CLIENT: ...something dealt (ph) me or back again. 
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. That—maybe just noticing that you are not crying and saying, “I used to do this. I probably ought to be doing this more. And I'm not.” You know. And maybe some sense that there is something waiting to come out or something waiting to be expressed that you are not expressing.
CLIENT: Right. Hmm.
THERAPIST: It's been about five years ago.
CLIENT: It's been awhile.
THERAPIST: Anything change back then about five years ago that would mark that turning point?
CLIENT: I think I gave up hope of ever finding a partner.
THERAPIST: Ah. Okay. Well that makes some sense. Then that could be feeling that sort of shut something down if that dream that you had that—didn't get fulfilled. [0:12:01] 
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. But giving in to that in a way, saying, “Well I think this is how my life is going to be,” may have been part of the shutting down process.
CLIENT: I think it has been.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And that doesn't feel right. You shouldn't be that shut down.
CLIENT: Well I'd like to be living, not wanting wanting. 
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: But also being able to keep my heart open.
THERAPIST: Ah. What would that mean, letting your heart...
CLIENT: It would mean I could have a good cry when I'm sad.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, do you feel sad sometimes if you don't find yourself crying?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Sort of make yourself cry.
CLIENT: Well but I used to be able to, like I told you. You know, there were parts of a book that would just be touching to me, and I could just go to that part in my book and it would unlock a whole lot. [0:13:05]
THERAPIST: And now are the books [a little weepy] (ph)?
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Let's have a look into it. But I don't know what to make of that. It makes sense to me, what you are saying, that at some point you just going to guess this isn't going to end. Something kind of clicked or changed at that point that you don't like in some way.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Now the other two are changes to make in the interest of your health, I guess. 
CLIENT: The crying is, too.
THERAPIST: And that is, too, you know. So all three of those, you would feel like you were healthier if you made those changes.
CLIENT: Much. [0:13:57]
THERAPIST: Much healthier. What—I mean in what ways do you think you would be healthier? What would you think, if you ate better and practiced yoga regularly and had a good cry over a book or a movie?
CLIENT: I think there would be a lot of satisfaction just in knowing I am taking good care of myself. 
THERAPIST: So it's that knowing again. “I am doing the right thing for myself to take care of myself and be healthy for me, and I'll have a good quality of life.”
CLIENT: Yeah. I would really—it's a knowing and a feeling.
THERAPIST: And a feeling. The feeling is the satisfaction. That's what you are...
CLIENT: Well I think I would feel more whole.
THERAPIST: And something you said earlier was—it suggested that you may have some reluctance about doing things on behalf of yourself, that you are more inclined to be doing things for other people. 
CLIENT: It's much easier over there. [0:15:00] 
THERAPIST: To be helping somebody else than to be helping yourself. 
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Do you see your—what do you see?
CLIENT: Maybe it's more familiar, or I am more accustomed or...
THERAPIST: You want to do it.
CLIENT: There is a “thank you” or I can see a positive result.
THERAPIST: Ah, yes. Okay. Yes. So you see...
CLIENT: So it's like that.
THERAPIST: There's something happening out there, and these things you don't see them giving you a positive result just knowing that in the long run it's a good idea but not immediately.
CLIENT: Right. It—in a—I don't know how to say it exactly. But in a sort of twisty way, it—there's part of me that thinks, “Those things aren't going to get you the boyfriend anyway, so why bother?” [0:16:02]
THERAPIST: So that would be one hook, one goal. If you make these changes you are more likely to find a relationship.
CLIENT: I know it's—well I'm wired in there like that.
THERAPIST: Ah. It's something you still want even though you kind of gave it up.
CLIENT: Yeah. I try not to want it.
THERAPIST: But that might be a whole new benefit if you did make some of these changes.
CLIENT: I think I partly don't make those changes because I am not very good at relationships. So that way I don't have to get into that hot water.
THERAPIST: So a relationship is something you want and something you don't want...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: ...at the same time.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So of course then you would be reluctant to make these other changes that would move you in that direction. 
CLIENT: Right. Flossing doesn't have anything to do with a boyfriend. [0:17:02]
THERAPIST: Very formidable relationship. The relationship is—huh! Okay. In fact, I mean making these changes might move you closer to being able to find a relationship, and you are not entirely sure you want that.
CLIENT: No. I don't see very many relationships out there that look very good to me.
THERAPIST: Right. So that, perhaps, was part of—you know, the giving-up process five years ago, that “I'm not really sure I want a relationship.”
CLIENT: Well I don't want to be sour grapesy about it.
THERAPIST: Ah.
CLIENT: But I don't have very much good relationship role modeling in my life...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...to make me think—or just in my own previous marriage's experience.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Like, I wouldn't want to quite do it like that again.
THERAPIST: And life on your own is okay? [0:18:03]
CLIENT: It's pretty amazing.
THERAPIST: Pretty amazing? At times it's pretty good.
CLIENT: It's very good.
THERAPIST: So I can see here is—I can see you are asking a lot what I want. You put all this effort into trying to create a relationship here that may be a lot of work and may not work out so well with—my life is pretty good as it is.
CLIENT: You know. But I miss kisses.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's wanting two things at the same time that seem to battle with what—you want to have a relationship but you don't want to have a relationship.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Both things are there. And these other things, in some ways, are tied up with that. They are—this...
CLIENT: They are all in my head.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So you wouldn't make changes in your eating habits on behalf of yourself. I mean you have been doing that predominantly with the hope of finding a relationship.
CLIENT: I'm really just sorry to say you are right. [0:19:01]
THERAPIST: I'm just sort of telling you what I am hearing here, so—you know. And the same with the yoga, that there is not really a reason for you to do that.
CLIENT: There would be if it would help me with my pain. But it didn't seem to. I—or I don't have faith that it does or would.
THERAPIST: Well it in fact creates pain in the short run. The rest...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: You are not sure that that would really have a benefit for you.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: So why would you want to do that? I am asking you about that.
CLIENT: Oh. (Laughs) I thought it was one of those self-evident truths.
THERAPIST: No. No. Well maybe it is for you. You know, you started by saying, “These are the changes I am thinking about making.”
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: But in a way it sounds like it's not.
CLIENT: Well that's why when (Lou)—my therapist—said that you were looking for some people who felt stuck... [0:20:06]
THERAPIST: Um-hum.
CLIENT: ...like, that—you know, that's when I maybe thought, “Oh! Me.” Because I just feel like I—kind of like in a trap. I feel like I'm trapped in a trap, you know. There are things I want...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...but reasons why not. And so I have been really stuck in that place.
THERAPIST: I like to put at the end, if you will, “I want this, and I don't want it.” And both things are true at the same time.
CLIENT: Right. 
THERAPIST: They don't really cancel each other out. It's not “but” exactly, but—you know.
CLIENT: I think it does get me stuck sometimes.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Yeah. It's—particularly around relationships, you do.
CLIENT: Well but it's the relationship with myself, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because I wouldn't be—just like I would be taking good care of myself. [0:21:02]
THERAPIST: Never mind a relationship.
CLIENT: Never mind. Just the relationship with myself. 
THERAPIST: All right. So that would be your goal. You know, just kind of set relationships aside for the time being. If your goal were just to take good care of yourself and you see that you are healthy and have a good quality of life, what changes then would you make—might you make for that reason?
CLIENT: Well do they really have these things? But I don't.
THERAPIST: What little—what are the other things?
CLIENT: And the other things are more of this—you know, more of that's the goal.
THERAPIST: So that one's still in the game. Okay.
CLIENT: Like—you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: That it is just the sensible things, you know—not snacking, eating less, moving more.
THERAPIST: Exercise. Moving, yeah. Do you...
CLIENT: Exercise, moving, yoga, take a walk.
THERAPIST: Okay. And then there's...
CLIENT: And they are just so, like, basically simple in every way. [0:22:00]
THERAPIST: So those are things to do for yourself, never mind the relationship being -[back on] (ph). 
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Now, because what? That you would hope that in five years...
CLIENT: (Laughs) Forget five years. I can't even imagine five years. I...
THERAPIST: Let's do four.
CLIENT: I can imagine this afternoon. I can imagine tomorrow.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well there's something else then, because the benefits of all those things you are talking about are way past tomorrow.
CLIENT: Right. But I'm not there. I'm here.
THERAPIST: You are right here.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And this is the only thing that matters and is real right now, this—today and maybe tomorrow.
CLIENT: Afternoon.
THERAPIST: Tomorrow after—yeah. Not...
CLIENT: Till then.
THERAPIST: Nothing beyond tomorrow afternoon. Twenty-four hours is just about it. Yeah. Well within that perspective that makes sense to make those changes, really. I mean if it's just right now, this is the window that matters. I mean the changes that you were—talked about making are things that will have benefits in terms of flexibility and health and so forth a year from now or further down the line. [0:23:13] 
CLIENT: But they would make me feel better today. See? I was pretty pleased with myself to have done my yoga practice this morning.
THERAPIST: And that felt good?
CLIENT: Yep. 
THERAPIST: Oh! I thought it mainly hurt to do the yoga thing and...
CLIENT: Well it does hurt. But it felt good in the—it felt good too. Not in the masochistic sense. But it felt good.
THERAPIST: No, no. Both things: It hurts and it feels good, both.
CLIENT: I am sorry about the “hurt” part. But the part that doesn't hurt feels good to do those stretches. And just to do something that's just for me.
THERAPIST: And there's something about that that feels really good when you do that. [0:24:01]
CLIENT: Right. But...
THERAPIST: It's satisfying.
CLIENT: But not enough to necessarily have you do it tomorrow...
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: ...also.
THERAPIST: Don't want to make any commitments today.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Keeping this stuff up.
CLIENT: No.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. But when you do that, at least—I mean I'm not worried about the salads and so forth. But when you do that, at least, there is something about it even right afterwards—like flossing—that's, “I'm glad I did that.”
CLIENT: Yeah. And even during the doing of it.
THERAPIST: And during it, too. That was pretty good actually.
CLIENT: Yeah. It's very good.
THERAPIST: Have a good feeling. For someone that's very living in the moment, that's good. Like, right now this—I feel good. I am happy that I am doing this.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: So it's a puzzle to you. How come I don't do that more often then, hm?
CLIENT: Well like I said before, it just feels self destructive that I am not.
THERAPIST: So you want to destroy yourself? Or... [0:25:01]
CLIENT: Well partly yes, partly no.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Again.
CLIENT: Again.
THERAPIST: Now why would you? What is there that is appealing about being self destructive, to you? There's something there that draws you to be [a seven] (ph).
CLIENT: Life is hard.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: And sometimes it seems like it would be very good to be out of it.
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: And on the other hand, life is very cool and so it's pretty amazing to be in it.
THERAPIST: Yes. Both things are true.
CLIENT: One of those Pisces people, where...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...you know, there is the fish going this way and the fish going that way, and then they are connected in the middle and...
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: ...they kind of sometimes have a hard time making progress.
THERAPIST: The yin and yang. And they are both—you know, that would—that symbol put together, they are opposite sides of the same thing.
Any other kinds of things you have thought about doing differently, I mean such as now? I mean anything (inaudible at 0:26:04)? 
(Pause, 20 seconds)
THERAPIST: Well that's a pretty nice list right there.
CLIENT: I—I'm sure there are. But I'm really just more thinking about these self-care...
THERAPIST: Fine.
CLIENT: This can be very personal, inbound (ph) space, my own body space...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...kind of things.
THERAPIST: Things that involve taking care of yourself.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Well let me ask you what could be—seem like a silly question. But if you imagine a scale from zero to ten, and I should say, how important is it for you to eat more vegetables and less carbohydrate, to make that change? Zero is not at all important, and ten is it's the most important thing in my life right now. Where would you put yourself on that scale? [0:27:10]
CLIENT: Seven-and-a-half.
THERAPIST: That's pretty high. That's pretty high.
CLIENT: That's why I'm sitting here.
THERAPIST: Yeah!
CLIENT: I want to get inspired.
THERAPIST: Why so high? What's—how come you are up at seven and not down at three or four?
CLIENT: I just am.
THERAPIST: Oh? No particular reason?
CLIENT: I want to be more proud of myself. And this—one would say it maybe...
THERAPIST: Knowing that you are taking care of yourself.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: See, that's critical—quite important to you. But it feels really good, at least when you...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: When you do that. [0:28:00]
CLIENT: Right. It does. I do.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Seven, seven-and-a-half. No less? That's pretty good. That's pretty high. Very good. I was going to—I was guessing that these—you would give me a somewhat lower number than that, though.
CLIENT: No. It's up there.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
CLIENT: And it would be great if I—perhaps liked doing those things, a few things that I have talked about.
THERAPIST: Right. It's important to. I wonder if it's wondering whether you can. How confident are you that you could make that change in your eating habits if you really decided to do—that same zero-to-ten scale?
CLIENT: I'm pretty good about other kinds of commitments.
THERAPIST: Right. So when you decided to do something...
CLIENT: But pretty much it—everybody knows it's going to get done.
THERAPIST: It gets done. It gets done. So it's pretty important then. You are pretty sure that you could do it if you really made up your mind to do it. [0:29:01]
CLIENT: Right. 
THERAPIST: Is it—it's the making up the mind to do it, I guess? It's uncertain.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Well I wish I could do that for you, but I can't.
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. What helps you to make a change like that? What other changes have you made in your mind? I mean there's probably been quite a few—where you put your mind to something and you said you were going to do this. And you did it.
CLIENT: Well I think a lot of times it's encouragement and support from another person.
THERAPIST: Yeah. So if someone else knows that you are doing this and—be in your corner.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And a little bit of accountability in that, too, right? You mentioned a while ago—I forget—it was about—I forget exactly how you said it. But if I say I am going to do it, people know that I am going to carry through with it. [0:30:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And I heard that people know that they...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That made me wonder about this, that if you had other people that you had really asked to help you make these changes, you know, that—I don't know if you have lunch with people and so forth—but, “Help me make the choices when I am out to lunch with you.” Something like that, maybe.
CLIENT: Hm.
THERAPIST: Yeah. I mean that's making a little bit of a commitment to do it when you begin asking other people. But that's something that might help you then, if someone else—where people are important to you, really, if this were something that you wanted to do and you asked them to help. 
CLIENT: Right. 
THERAPIST: You know. How else have you—have been—made changes in your life? That'd be relatively simple ones. But, again, where you have made up your mind to do something and went ahead and made that change.
CLIENT: I have just wanted to do something and gone ahead and done it. 
THERAPIST: It wasn't anything more than making up your mind. [0:31:01]
CLIENT: Pretty much.
THERAPIST: Wow. Right. So you think of yourself as a pretty strong-willed person, then. Because having decided to do something, it's going to happen.
CLIENT: Right. And it's much easier to, like, redo my garden. Or last year—or earlier this year I painted my house. I remember it was a different fabulous color.
THERAPIST: Great.
CLIENT: That—actually the things outside my own needs...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. Are easier to change, and you can see them changing, yeah?
CLIENT: Are easier to change. And then I have had partners working with me for those things. You know, friends that have helped. Whereas—as you said—this is just me doing it for me.
THERAPIST: Yes. Yeah.
CLIENT: And it's much harder for me to keep momentum—to get started and keep momentum going...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...just for myself or within myself. [0:31:55]
THERAPIST: Well making changes in the way we do things is—[you wonder about all things afterwards] (ph). It is easier to paint a room or help somebody else move or whatever it is—where you are doing something that you are focused on out there. And it has an ending, it gets finished and you can see the product of it—than making these changes, which are kind of ongoing. And as you change your eating habits you are really talking about changing them for a long time, ideally.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: To have the benefit. And the same thing with the yoga: It's not a one-day thing that's done. That's a practice that you do over time to strengthen your health.
CLIENT: Right. And then if I do it really conscientiously and then I stop, I lose all the benefit of all the energy that I have put into it in the past time.
THERAPIST: Oh!
CLIENT: So that's in there, too—the way most people who lose weight have gained it all back within a year. 
THERAPIST: Right. 
CLIENT: People who do a lot of exercising and then they stop. Their body stiffens up. You know, it's like... [0:33:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: But some of it—I don't know. It just—the change sort of has some heavy weight...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: ...pulling it backwards, or pulling my intention away from actually saying, “Okay. I'm doing it.” 
THERAPIST: Well it's a difference between a diet and changing your eating habits. I mean a diet has just kind of a timeframe to it. “I am going to do this for awhile.”
CLIENT: Hm. (Laughs) I wouldn't know about that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, right. Whereas healthier eating is something that's more—a lot of choices open...
CLIENT: It's a lifetime of choice.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Exactly. One thing that you can think of doing to help you with that is having some support from friends around you. 
CLIENT: Maybe. I don't know. [0:34:03]
THERAPIST: Even that you are not sure of.
CLIENT: No, I'm not sure.
THERAPIST: You had a yoga instructor at one point, and obviously at that point you were working with that person to...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: To do the yoga. 
CLIENT: Right. And she taught me this whole series of movements to make.
THERAPIST: Right. Right. And then when that relationship ended, then so did the yoga pretty much for you.
CLIENT: I do it sometimes.
THERAPIST: Yeah, now and then. Yeah.
CLIENT: Now and then. Or I'll just have a burst and do it three days in a row.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And then I won't.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And then some—I'll just say, “I have to do this for myself.” And then I'll, like, make myself do it.
THERAPIST: Make yourself.
CLIENT: Whereas the flossing isn't like that. And then...
THERAPIST: Because it's not easy.
CLIENT: For some people flossing is, like, the worst horrible least-done thing.
THERAPIST: Oh I know. I have had this conversation with people about flossing also. So... 
CLIENT: Right. So for me it—and I don't know what makes that—well I just like doing it. And it's quick, also. I don't know. It's just something that is a given. And the others are not for me. [0:35:14]
THERAPIST: Even though they are important to you?
CLIENT: Even though they are important.
THERAPIST: And you know you could do better...
CLIENT: I know I could do better.
THERAPIST: ...with your mind. But not quite important enough to quite get over the hump there. What...
CLIENT: I don't know. I guess I have this strong voice that says, “You know what? Why bother?”
THERAPIST: Why bother. Yeah. What's the answer to that question?
CLIENT: Well it's kind of amorphous, you know. 
THERAPIST: Why not just kind of let yourself go and eat what you want and never mind the exercise and yoga?
CLIENT: Going for less (ph).
THERAPIST: Um-hum. Why bother? Because you said it's a seven, seven-and-a-half. That's something about—a strong reason to bother with it, you know. [0:36:11]
CLIENT: Well it's—they are very good ideas, those things.
THERAPIST: In the abstract, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Everybody says...
THERAPIST: Other people say.
CLIENT: “Good idea.”
THERAPIST: Yeah? But maybe not what you want.
CLIENT: I partly do.
THERAPIST: You partly—that's right. You partly do. You partly do. Yeah.
CLIENT: Right. 
THERAPIST: And that's—and—so that's the stuck place. You listen...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Because as long as it's kind of a, “I kind of want to, but I don't want to,” then you are really—won't make up your mind to do what people say. So...
CLIENT: No, I really wouldn't.
THERAPIST: So usually what happens if you think of a reason why you should do it, then you think of a reason why you don't want to do it and then you stop thinking about it. So that's the stuck place. 
CLIENT: Right. [0:37:00]
THERAPIST: Well we have the opportunity that—to talk again in a few days if you wish. And if you want to do that, I wonder if in the meantime you could spend some time thinking about, “If I did decide to do this, if I did decide to make a change in my eating habits—and the practice, you know—how would I do it? How—what could I do to really make that work?” Because that's a—that's not clear to me yet.
But you know yourself way better than anybody else does. So what could you do to move that in the direction of being like flossing or whatever, that just kind of built in and it's a part of your life and it's what you do and you like doing it? Because it—it's then taking care of yourself. It even has some immediately good feeling about it. [0:37:59]
I think that from here—I'm not saying you are agreeing to do it at all. But let's just imagine you did make up your mind to do that. How would you do that?
CLIENT: Right now I don't know, or I might have done it. And I wouldn't be sitting here.
THERAPIST: Sure. Sure. So that's what I am suggesting, you give a little time to reflecting on it, if you are willing.
CLIENT: I am willing.
THERAPIST: And we can chat again when you come back and pick it up from there.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Does that sound okay?
CLIENT: Yeah. I'm kind of hesitant, but all right.
THERAPIST: All right. And the hesitation is?
CLIENT: Why would anything be different in four days than it is today?
THERAPIST: It might not. It might not. I am asking you a hypothetical here.
CLIENT: I know. But it's not like I've never thought about these things before. I just have never come up with a plan that worked for myself. [0:38:55]
THERAPIST: Okay. And a plan is what I am talking about. And it—and if you come back and you don't have a plan, that's fine. We'll—I mean I have [lots of work] (ph). But the idea is, you know, that you have the answer for you about how best to do this in your life. I'm not an expert on you; you're the expert on you. So you are going to know best how to actually get that done if you would decide to do it. I am not asking you to decide to do it at all. So if that wouldn't be any different four days from now. 
But just to use the smart thing you have got about yourself. Suppose something did happen that made it more important or (inaudible at 0:39:39). “I've made up my mind this is what I am going to do.” Knowing what you know about yourself, what are the things you could build in to do that? And if you don't come up with other ideas, well maybe we can talk some more next time we meet.
CLIENT: All right.
THERAPIST: Okay?
CLIENT: Okay. 
THERAPIST: Now don't feel like you have to come up with a great plan. Give it a little thought, sleep on it.
CLIENT: I'll ask for a dream of guidance and ask for...
THERAPIST: Ask for a little guidance. Very good. Do a little yoga through it, don't you?
CLIENT: Uh-huh.
THERAPIST: Yeah. All right.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: So we'll talk again.
CLIENT: All right. Thank you.
THERAPIST: Good.
