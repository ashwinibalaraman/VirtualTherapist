THERAPIST: Good morning.
CLIENT: Good morning. 
THERAPIST: So you're out next Friday?
CLIENT: Yeah. I'll be in South Carolina. I wish I was going to be here because I have a closing today and another one that's going to close on Monday. It's weird. I asked Jess if she could help me next Friday. Instead of immediately saying we're going she said, "What do you need me to do?" And I said, "I need you to send out a wire," and then she says, "I can't do it." I go, "Why not?' and she goes, "We're going away." I don't think it happened exactly like that, but the way it made me feel like if she was making up an excuse for it after the fact, I don't know. Maybe she is going away. I don't know. They have branches there. I haven't put it out to her yet. Hopefully my bank will let me wire the money while I'm out of town, but it just drives me fucking crazy. I have no sense that we're going to close on Monday at all. [00:01:21] If we don't close Monday, we have to wait an entire month to close, which sucks. Either way it sucks. My dad is coming into town today. He can barely walk, so we really can't do anything. Ian wanted to go pick him up at the airport, but he's going to this arts camp, and they do their presentations, their little performances, on Friday. He's missed all his performances because he went to the beach, and last week he went to the beach, so he wants to do his performance today. My dad can't go because there's no place to sit. He can't stand up for 50 minutes. [00:02:16] So I don't know what we're going to do this weekend, just hang out at the hotel and go swimming, I guess. You know it's starting to bother me with Lucille, how she's not really taking to me or bonding with me. I picked up Ian from camp yesterday and as soon as I came in she just gets all whiney and runs to her mom. She'll play with me a little bit, but still there's always some point at which she gets whiney and runs to her mom. [00:03:03] I remember there was a parent once who had two kids and, maybe the kids were a little older, but one of the kids was whining. The mom was just like, "You're not going to get what you want by whining." I don't know what your thoughts are on that. Maybe she's a little too young to understand about not whining.
THERAPIST: Probably. [00:03:25]
CLIENT: It just bothered me for the first time yesterday where I'm like just getting sick of this. I kept asking you for a hug and she said "no". She wouldn't give me a hug the whole time that I was there. Usually she gives me a hug right away, but she wouldn't even give me a hug goodbye. I don't know if this weekend is going to be a disaster or what, but they have a pool at the hotel so we'll probably just go swimming all day. I guess my dad can walk over to the gallery from lunch or whatever. Some friends are having a barbeque on Saturday, which I'd rather go to than spend time with my family. I'm contemplatingâ€”when I first let my parents know what kind of trouble I was in, my stepmom lent me $10,000 and I used the money that my parents gave me to pay her back. [00:04:38] I'm kind of wondering whether she still has the money to lend me, but whether I should borrow the $10,000 or ask, at least, just to get caught up on my rent and have a little bit of a cushion, be able to pay my taxes next month. It would go a long way for me to have a little bit of extra. Just living from moment to moment juggling everything is really becoming difficult. I don't know how I'm going to pay for my health insurance. The DOR gets paid today. I sent out a check that I don't have the money to cover to the IRS. If this closing is not going to happen, I've got to decide whether to pay my rent or my health insurance. [00:05:43] I've got to pay my rent, because I've got a real landlord now. I can't fuck around, so it's a mess, as usual. Life insurance hits at the beginning of the month, that's like $250. I called my mortgage guy yesterday. I texted him and I called up the message. I just wanted to know what's going on with these closings. At least they're closing them. I may have to have someone cover for me on Thursday. He owes me. I did a title for him and it's not closing. Usually the deal is that if it doesn't close, we split it. He'll just pay for half of the title, which half of $175 is, what, $87.50? And he said that we'll be even if he does the closing, so I think he's kind of throwing in the fact that he's giving me these last-minute titles, because I should be paid more than $87.50 to do a closing. 
THERAPIST: So that actually works out for you? [00:07:13]
CLIENT: Yeah. I'd prefer to let me do the title and the closing and get the $87.50, but at least I don't have to worry immensely. He's competent. The doctor put me on Prozac now. Very small doses, like half a pill for a week and then 10 mg, which I still think is a pretty low dose. I'm kind of glad. I've got to get off this fucking Nortriptyline. It hadn't happened for a while, but I'm starting to stand up and get light-headed and dizzy again. She said one of the medicines I take offsets the effect of the Nortriptyline. I really feel like I got screwed, jumping from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, and instead of adjusting medications, everyone just sort of piled on. I don't even remember that crazy man who fired me and put me on the Nortriptyline. At the hospital they put me on one medication and they put me on another medication. I don't remember if I was ever on Prozac or not. I think I might have been at some point. [00:09:21] I was getting nauseous. The psychiatrist said you just have to take it with food. It's depressing, not to overuse that word. I've got a month left as president of E&amp;G.;
THERAPIST: You're not getting a whole lot of help or support from anywhere.
CLIENT: No. You noticed? 
THERAPIST: It's subtle, (chuckles) but yeah.
CLIENT: The thing with Jess is like normally I wouldn't really . . . it just seems weird that there's this real . . it's like there's a concerted effort not to help me. Maybe I'm just imagining it, but it really feels like she's going out of her way to not help me. [00:10:58] If I can't get that wire out on Friday it's going to cost me $700, which is basically what I'm making on the loan; so it's going to be a free closing. It just sucks. I kind of don't know how to bring it up because my dad needs help. He said he didn't have any more money this year to give me. [00:12:11] I don't know what to do with my tenants. It's sort of against the wishes of the buyer. I was going to sign them to a full year lease. They haven't gotten back to me. They haven't paid their August rent. I don't know if they're planning on staying or moving out. Kind of like how are they going to move out? They don't have any money. They can't pay their rent. How are they going to come up with their first &amp; security? I've got their security deposit. (pause) [00:13:51] And I have this fear. I've got a fantasy football draft at 7:30 on Monday. I have a feeling I'm going to be stuck doing this closing Monday night, because Lord knows when I'm going to get the documents. Lord knows when the buyer is available. Just nothing seems to be lining up for me. [00:14:57]
THERAPIST: How much is the trip costing you?
CLIENT: My dad paid for the plane ticket.
THERAPIST: I mean more in terms of lost work.
CLIENT: Depends whether I can get the wire out or not, you know? That's the only thing. I've got the closing which is probably going to happen Thursday, which I've got someone to cover for me, and that loan I'm going to fund on Friday, if it happens at all. The wire has to go out on Friday because it has to be paid by the first of the month, which is Saturday. If it's not paid by the first of the month they tack a whole month's interest on top of it. That would completely suck. [00:16:18] If I could do it by fax or e-mail or something like that, I'd be fine. I have the house yet at my bank. I'll ask them what I can do. I've got to be able to do something. They know who I am. It sucks. Every time I leave town I'm always dealing with some closing. It's like I had the whole month of July to deal with closings and nothing. Even August I've had the whole fucking month and nothing has been going on. Now all of a sudden it's the end of the month and I probably should have made the decision. I still would have had to leave on Friday at some point. [00:17:58] I'm really just getting sick of it all. It's wearing on me. There's no Frisbee this week. No Frisbee the next week, so I've got nothing to do. There's a band coming to town at the end of September that I want to see but I don't know of anybody else that would want to see them. Tickets are like $14. I'm contemplating whether I should just go by myself. [00:19:26]
Got an audit coming up from the title company. I've been through it before so it's not horrendous. They want the last three months of closing files to pick through and there ain't a whole lot of them to go through so . . . Got to reconcile my accounts. Basically, I'm going to have to fudge a three-way reconciliation. You have to account for all the money that's the balance that's in the account, reconcile it. Mine is so fucked up that I don't know. I'm basically going to have to fudge it. In some regards it's fraud, defrauding the title company. [00:21:31] I just seem to be getting into this deeper and deeper hole. It seems like there's potential. The realtor at E&G; she was like, "I've got a cash sale for you but they're $2,000 apart." The buyer won't go up any more. It's like two fucking thousand dollars on a $200,000 house, you know? (pause) [00:23:20] I don't know what I'm going to do in November and December when there isn't any work. I don't even know what I'm going to do for Thanksgiving. Get take-out Chinese food, I guess. 
THERAPIST: Sounds pretty helpless and hopeless.
CLIENT: Pretty much. 
THERAPIST: It's like there's nothing you can do.
CLIENT: Yeah, I don't know what to do. [00:24:48]
THERAPIST: Do you have thoughts or just nothing even occurs to you?
CLIENT: Yeah, I'm at a loss for what to do. (pause) [00:26:22] Technically I have two closings that might close in September and October. The seller rented them in October so those months aren't completely . . . 
THERAPIST: I would imagine you've thought all the way through this, but it seems like in a way doing the titles have been a downside because they're not paying you on time. But putting that aside for a minute, that's been helpful in that you're not getting paid as well, obviously, as you do for a closing, but it's work that's been somewhat steady, I think.
CLIENT: Yeah, I've had a bunch of them to do for him. 
THERAPIST: I guess I'm wondering if there's anything else like that, whether it's titles for other people or teaching. Some other kind of work that even if it's not as good hourly as the stuff . . . [00:27:40]
CLIENT: I don't know where to begin to look. 
THERAPIST: I guess it's sometimes hard for me to tell how much you don't think about these things or think them through because you're so anxious and defeated and down; and how much is it that you've thought a lot about these things and there is just nothing you can do. That's sort of hard for me to assess. [00:28:23]
CLIENT: I mean I have thought about it. I asked for those referrals from E&amp;G.; I don't know. I mean the teaching you get, the good teaching jobs, for a semester you get like $3,000. Jess's mom works out of a school and she's just moved to a new one, so I don't know whether she could get me a job teaching there, but it's just an unbelievable amount of work for . . . 
THERAPIST: Yeah. Very little.
CLIENT: Most attorneys already have their title examiners they've been using forever. I just got lucky that this guy got into a pissing match with his old title examiner.
THERAPIST: I see. So that's hard work to find essentially.
CLIENT: Yeah. If I could afford it I would put together some sort of marketing piece and come up with some sort of piece whether I could lower my fees or some way to attract new business and mail it to all the mortgage companies. But I don't have the money to have that designed or put together or mailed. It's always like I don't know where to begin. Part of it is just getting the motivation to do this kind of stuff. I don't know how effective it would be. I'd probably need to dump a couple thousand dollars to do it right, you know? [00:30:30]
THERAPIST: Maybe. Maybe not. I mean there are plenty of cheap ways to get things like design if you find something that's already out there and basically rip it off, like you find somebody else with something similar but not the same and you just download it and strip it down. There can be cheaper ways to do it than the right way of having somebody come in and really talk to you about it. Though I hear you that part of the problem is the money, part of the problem is knowing which of those sorts of ideas would be the best to pursue. And then there's sort of picking yourself up and seeing what it is enough to follow through on it. 
CLIENT: It's just hard when you already feel defeated. [00:32:00]
THERAPIST: Absolutely. Why is it hard? Is it that it brings out how bad things have been? It feels like a new way you're going to fall on your face?
CLIENT: Yeah. There's part of that. But it's like how do I do it? What do I do? What gimmick am I going to use? 
THERAPIST: Like whether it's lower pricing or something else. (long pause) [00:34:34]
CLIENT: I don't know. Then if you do connect with people then you have to go meet them. I don't know. I've done so much of that and it hasn't panned out. Just the idea of . . . 
THERAPIST: Yeah sounds like you could do more of that. [00:36:53] What is it, Jay?
CLIENT: I don't know. Just thinking about all the things I have to spend money on. It's like I have no fucking clothes that I can wear to work. All my shirts are stained or have ring around the collar. The fucking check-engine light is on. I'm fucking dying in my car because the air conditioning doesn't work. I haven't paid my cell phone bill yet. I owe money to my landlord. Just, you know, as soon as the money comes in it's already accounted for and gone. It's like I get into the office and I'm almost paralyzed with the inability to just do what I need to do. I got there yesterday morning and just couldn't do anything. I did nothing. I watered the plants, played Words with friends, surfed the web. [00:39:00]
THERAPIST: Maybe I didn't realize how much that's still happening where you're at work and you just can't get to work. 
CLIENT: It's like I've got these titles and I just wait until the last fucking second to do them. I've got two printers in my apartment, and both of them are fucked upâ€”actually three. The one that the woman who was there before left, I can't get that thing to print. Then my old fax machine that she used as a printer. After like six or seven pages it starts having these black lines show up across it. Jess wanted me to get the multifunction scanner/copier/fax machine/printer out of the office, so I take that. It's a slow scanner, but at least it's a scanner. I try printing on that. It's not laser, but it's at least printing enough for title work. Now it keeps giving me these "unable to print" errors. [00:40:22] I can't get anything to just work right, you know? It's like I just had a closing and the money's already gone. Already gone. I have phone bills. I have the surveying company a couple of surveys that I owe money for that I was holding back. They were hounding me for the money so I finally sent them the money, which came out of the fucking closing. You make $800 on a closing, $300 for surveys, another $150 for phone. What's thatâ€”$450? Then just money to eat and put gas in my car. $50 to put gas in my car. I do that a couple times a week. $25 every week to the psychiatrist. $15 for every prescription I have, which I'm constantly getting everything I have refilled. $375 between the DOR and the IRS. [00:42:00] I've got to come up with another almost $600 for health insurance, which I've got to come up with. I don't know where that's going to come from. Oh, I've got to pay my fucking malpractice insurance that's due on the second. I forgot about that. There's always something I forget about. You want to think "Oh, I've got it all covered." There's always something else. If I can't get that wire out, that's $6-700 then I need that I'm not going to have. 
THERAPIST: [ ] (inaudible at 00:43:16) 
CLIENT: [That's a lie] (inaudible at 00:43:21)
