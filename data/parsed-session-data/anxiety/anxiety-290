<font size="4"><b>March 23</b></font>

It is difficult to dispel the conviction that my life ceased
to exist, for all intents and purposes, in June of 1970. The self
that I had so painstakingly constructed out of experience and
intuition was toppled on that occasion, totally and comprehensively.
My personal identity has returned to me only fleetingly since,
for a few weeks here and there. It is therefore no longer something
I can take for granted.


Physical Symptoms:<br />
Breakup of skin, irritation (especially hair), anxiety, impotence,
mental capacity reduced to virtually zero; therefore, interests or
positive distractions, zero; therefore, accent on negativity. Physical
lethargy, inertia, constant. Heavy smoking/eating; television overkill
and "heavy" sleep (inactivity) have been my principal diet
for at least six months. Complete inability to extend myself
positively in any direction and obtain requisite satisfaction and
later relaxation. Imagination limited to odd moments of dim
reflection. Concentration exceedingly poor. Loss of body hair
(excessive) and general glandular/muscular feeling remain as
chief barometer regarding continuance of illness.


Today: What day? <i>Das Lied von der Erde</i> (Mahler's enigmatic
Esoteric, symphony). Who said that only Mahler could have
made the earth sing? I once thought along similar lines; now,
to remember such things, I feel nausea, puke flowing violently
through my synapses.

<b>Sunday, March 4</b>

Situation remains exactly as described above. It now is exactly
the same as the most terrible weeks and months of March-June,
1971; no specific external pressures are exerted, and yet the
whole metabolism is in the grip of total collapse.

The alternatives or options available may be listed below:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Go back to Keele and continue with the prescribed
medication. An unsatisfactory solution in my view (although, in
the short-term, clearly the most attractive), since it holds, at the
very best, the prospect of a very abnormal existence, as was the
case during the academic session '71-'72 at the university-while
Parnate was being prescribed.
</p>
<p>
(This way means that the illness is merely placed in cold
storage and the fundamental and plaguing difficulties continue
with only partial remedies available to relieve some of the terrible
sufferings.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Attempt the possibility outlined above (March 3). If the
Fairfield authorities will not agree to such an "experiment,"
then it will be imperative to obtain the cooperation of other
hospital facilities for this purpose. This avenue, though it means
considerable suffering in the short-term, seems to hold the most
constructive and realistic chances of a cure--ultimately. At the
time of writing these brief notes, my mind hurts terribly--so much
that a constant, continuing thudding is felt at my temples. Unbearable
tensions and anxieties are a constant companion.
</p>
<p>
At this moment, the thought of death is a beautiful one; the
prospect of peace and eternal release in another life is a very
attractive one indeed. Nonetheless, I am adamantly determined to
resist such temptations, as this totally unnecessary suffering must
have a cause--and, an end. I am absolutely determined to see it
through and so outlive this cancer.

<b>Sometime in March</b>

Revelations; I can reflect a trifle on nothing of import. I think
of the summers I have really lived in: there was '59--nice and
warm and also friendly enough. There was '65--smashing. 1967
and, lastly and probably finally, there was that esoteric summer of
1972--engulfed in Lindsay's "Dream on a Hill," that educational
miscarriage that is so painful--Christ, that was but a few short,
sweet, months ago. I also used to prefer winter really, especially

However, our betters do insist on creating myths and legends
out of summers; perhaps it's something to do with the fact
that ancient civilizations worshiped sun gods--<i>god</i>, as usual,
being a useful synonym for things incomprehensible to man.
Media manipulates summers into goddesses of the Harlowe/
Dietrich/West/Garbo format, sometimes rightly; sometimes they
screw things up. It's funny thinking without inhaling life. Think
tanks; think, think, think, FUNK.


1967--"I remember it well." Grasping incomprehensible nonsense
about the "Separation of Powers" in the unwritten English
constitution. Feet upon a small, wooden table in the ‘abbey’ flats
at Saint Chris. The small faces, the Kinks, traffic, the stones, and,
of course, the Fab Four. Inebriated on various medicinal comforts:
Tobacco was ‘respectable’--the former was not, really.
I feel melancholy--but continue to have "cider with Rosie."


Suddenly I am thinking back again, to '65--the autumn to be
precise. I remember somehow getting into the Bull and Bush
public house; the Who were, as per usual, going berserk; supporting
Keith Moon's vice squad was Eric Clapton's Powerhouse
(as they were then, I think, billed). Immensely enjoyable evening
and some quite off-beat mod girls--gyrating about to their newly
found Mary Quant/Hip/Twig-the-Wonder-Kid/grace and freedom.
I'm afraid I didn't totally grasp the significance of Mr.
Clapton then; though, later, with the media-styled, short-lived,
"super group"--Blind Faith, it became abundantly clear that he
was the finest manipulator of the blues guitar that white men have
yet produced. Winter--great, but he generated a weird viciousness
--Clapton radiated an emotional warmth which he was to stamp
indelibly on the Dominoes album: "Layla."


1967--what did I consume in the form of literature? Two
books stand out, because they made an impression upon me that
had happened before, rarely, and only once, since. Primo Levi's
<i>If This Is, a Man</i> and André Swartz-Bart's <i>The Last of the Just</i>.
Found them tough going then--they'd be impossible now. They

<b>Continuation on the Earlier Theme of Sometime in March</b>

I feel a decrepit blob of DNA plus. Big business made a lot
of money out of the '67 period; they also made bread galore from
<i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>--(the film version, with Mr. Lew
Ayres) and the "sequel" from the Weimar republic, Pabst's
<i>Kammeradschaft</i>--perhaps more compelling. The message was
simple, ‘gentle,’ quiet, in all these cases. No one listened, as usual,
and Homo-sapiens suffered for their stupidity. Europe went mad
as the decade of the twenties passed. As the sixties drew to a close,
Europe and the world manifested that same violent, sickening
vulgarity. Reason was engulfed in a veritable ocean of hate. Our
generation has failed; it believed itself to be unique--in some ways,
it was and still is. All that is lost to me now--I hope not forever!


Pretending to live when you are dead is a drag. Oh yes, there
was that play I witnessed on the cathode tube recently: <i>The
Resistible Rise of Alturo Uie</i>. Superb. Remember wondering
about "Bugs" Moran; "Baby-Face Nelson" and his swarm of
mobsters dining with Messrs. Hitler, Heydrich, Himmler, Stangel,
Hoess, etc., out in some pleasant retreat in the skies--with that
manic-depressive rugby-footballer big G--as their "fall guy."
Only a genius could have created so much out of so simple an
idea. Unfortunately can't remember the author's name. I
meditated for a while, half-recollected an occasion when some
self-styled economist talked some marketing games with me.
His biggest worry seemed to be who were the largest "private"
institutions, free-enterprise corporations left! He spent thirty

This tragicomedy must have a purpose. The above was a
reasonably nice experience, since it constituted a moment of
nostalgia, and I've suddenly realised that I'm writing/scribbling
with a Magyar instrument--a biro.


Wow--<i>The Mortal Storm</i>--what a movie; engulfed in sentimentality,
yes. Certainly no D. W. Griffith, Eisenstein, Lang,
Kubrick, etc. Perhaps though, it contained something even more
profound because of its essential simplicity. There was no pretence
of creative genius, not on the part of the director, no innovations
in camera work--and no one would claim the acting "intense."
Nevertheless, it had a devastatingly fierce presence which we all
live in the company of; the fear of heresy.

<b>Saturday, March 3</b>

Reflecting on the previous three days, the only factor which
is consistently normal, as it were, is the ability to enjoy an untroubled
sleep. With this singular exception, I have to admit the
truth that the illness is as pervasive as ever. Evidenced by the
fact, the chronic feeling, that I am constantly in a low gear,
mentally, accompanied by a "cloudiness" in my brain and an
acute indecisiveness. Moreover, my apparent physical "incapacitation"
prevails, especially the lack of access to life-energy.


An idea occurred to me as I arose (12:30 A.M.) which,
after brief consideration, appeared to augur well for the long run.
Fundamentally it goes as follows: to discontinue all official treatment,
so that the illness is allowed to run its natural-cycle course
again (I am convinced that the Parnate/Nardil medications have
basically altered these cycles), and, so, wait for the spontaneous
recovery--naturally, which is inherent in the illness. This stage
could occupy a period of several months, as I am well aware.
However, I am at this moment of the opinion that it would

By early evening, the attempt at preserving a routine had
borne out my belief above, that the day would be hopelessly
empty, barely tolerable, unbearable to the uninitiated. The future,
as is usual in these states, seems bleak, pointless, superfluous.
A further factor--cigarette consumption approaching thirty for
the "shortened" day (five or six hours).


The knowledge of Keele on the horizon is an "attractive
irritation." I know that, in my present plight, my projected plans
for Keele (at least as regards employment) will remain unrealised.
However, the self will be embayed in calmer waters.
If only my capacity to exert myself forcefully and obtain satisfaction
and, later, positive relaxation were restored, I would be
ecstatically happy.


I am still alive. I do not feel alive in the general meaning
of this word. I fail to understand how, and also why, I am still
alive. I am, of course, indebted to those closest to me, though
I realise that, in the last analysis, some inner mechanism must
be at play, secretly, silently, preserving the "life instinct."
