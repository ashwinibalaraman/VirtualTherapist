I BEGGED to have my own appearance and acts speak
for me; for Madam either to dismiss me, or to assign
a cause, from her personal knowledge, why I should
be detained. She bade me “be quiet,” saying: “The
Madams did what they could to have justice extended to all.”
Before promising to keep quiet I reminded her of my association
with, and love for, her order, asking her to consider
these facts and not to look upon my silence as weak-mindedness,
but rather the result of confidence and a will-power to
do her bidding, but I contended that it was a strange place
to be forced to accept the rest-cure. Yet the word “rest” had
been used in my enforced ride with my two captors. My determination
to be quiet was broken in a few days. Doubts were
expressed, and acted upon with all possible force. I asked
to see the State's Attorney, lawyer, friends; and to know the
pronounced cause assigned for the needed rest--whether fraud,
or the result of misunderstanding, or want of judgment on
the part of others, or of gossip.


I first pleaded for, and then demanded, my rights as a
citizen, for the opportunity to regain my liberty. “What will
you do for me, Madam? Whatever has been told you about
me, having been captured, not having knowledge of my effects,
or of myself, may not be, and is not, your fault. But to keep
me here for a rest, against my will, is your fault.” While I
was speaking the door of the Hall was opened by Dr. Salt.
After the usual courtesy, he enquired after my health.


I answered: “I am filled with anxiety; <i>and it is unmercifully
cruel not to give me a proved cause for my detention.
It is also cruel not to give me information of the power which
gave them the right to receive and detain me.”</i> A few words
about those who brought me here were given in answer. I
interrupted the remark by declaring that I considered the
Institution responsible for my <i>stay</i>.

Immediately after the departure of Dr. Salt a patient
entered my room, seated herself opposite me, and remarked:
“I don't know what to do. I have nearly busted my brains
open; my muscles are tired doing nothing. My anticipations
are great; if I were home I would take that flower-pot back
to the florist's; for although a minister of the church gave
it to me I know it was never paid for.”


I suggested that she might do as the rest of us were doing
--be satisfied with the present state of affairs, and accept
what came between dinner and supper as a round of pleasure.
She grew indignant, and informed me that she was an honored
wife, and the beloved mother of eight children. And under
Madam Pike's care, she said, there could not be any round of
pleasure. And on this ground she attacked my sanity. But
her wordy onset being over she became friendly again, and
so I taught her a song, fearing as I did further conversation.
The song is as follows:


“When my heart goes pit-a-pat,<br />
And my brain goes whirl-i-gig,<br />
And my brow goes rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub,<br />
That's the sign that I'm in love.”


And so the day's routine wound up in song. It was the one
way for me to carry out the round of pleasure.


Among the patients was a Mrs. R., or R-----. She
is a bright, capable woman; and so I sought her society. She
was at that time a patient only to be sure of the cure of a drug
habit; so she was even free of that or any other trouble, and
was in a few weeks to return home. She confidentially told
me that she thought I would need a lawyer to gain my release.
So she promised to make efforts toward getting me a counsel.
I credited her statement and believed she would keep her
word; and silently, and with great expectations, I awaited her
departure, which would bring the Attorney to whom Mrs. R.
was to write.


The Candidate who assisted on the Hall where I was
displayed a will power and strength of character much beyond
the seventeen years she had lived. It was natural for me

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several times when the Madam Assistant was talking
with this Candidate and Mrs. R., of R-----, I would demand
in their presence to be allowed to leave the house. The demands
on my part for liberty will not be mentioned again
except incidentally; they will be dismissed with the assurance
that they were made by me from time to time to doctors,
Madam Superioress, Madam Pike, and to the other Madams
with whom I came in contact. In answer to these demands I
was told that they had nothing to do with it; but they hoped
justice would be extended to me.


In the meantime I was denied all privileges, and admonished
to be quiet. My next request was to ask Madam Pike
to give me occupation; and I even mentioned what I was
capable of doing, namely: to sew for Madam Pike personally,
for the Institution, or for the poor who came about begging,
or for the helpless and poorer classes of patients.


I enquired if there were children or even grown persons
whom I could teach the ordinary rudiments of education, or
music lessons.


I asked for the use of a dictionary, a French book, or
a Latin book, to renew my studies in those languages; or, as
I told her, <i>any</i> occupation would be acceptable.


With the exception of three or four books from the library
of the Institution, and five or six magazines loaned me for a
few hours at a time, none of the above requests were ever
granted to me. Seeing I was doomed to idleness as far as
Madam Pike was concerned, I set to work to make occupation
for myself. All that I had to use were some of my own possessions,
such as a few pieces of clothing, hat, old ribbon,
some odds and ends of muslin, two or three needles, and a few
yards of spool cotton. Having some little mending to do, the
cotton was soon exhausted; Madam Assistant gave me a few
yards, as did Madam Pike, but before many weeks had passed
I was told by Madam Pike that the Institution could not
supply me with cotton. She said I had begged long enough.
I answered, as I expected at any day to be dismissed, I had

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177204-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After that the Assistant Nurse gave me a few yards of
spool cotton, seeing as she did that I needed it for mending
my wearing apparel. As necessity is the mother of invention,
my needs suggested the idea of ripping out machine work.
This afforded me the occupations of ripping and sewing, and
left me cotton for future needs.


Among the articles in my possession was a corded black
silk waist. I separated the strands of the cords. This furnished
me the cotton to work out embroidery stitches, on old
ribbons and pieces of dry goods, and it gave me darning cotton.
After the stocking which had been darned had been
placed in water the black cord turned red. When Madam
Pike noticed this she thought she bad proof that I had taken
the cotton or had by insane means secured it.


A few proofs and comments presented by me on the laws
of chemistry settled that attack on me, as well as the previous
question.


One day a carpenter was mending furniture; while he
worked he sang, but if I were appointed an umpire, I would
have decided of his music, as I once did of a certain church
choir, that noise was success.


During the time he worked I asked Madam Pike to dismiss
me. To my surprise, she accused me of wanting to show
off before the carpenter, and sent me to my room, telling me
to be quiet.


The day the above occurrence happened I received a letter
from one of my captors, enquiring about my appetite. I had
just left friends with whom I had boarded for nearly two
years, who could take oath with me that I was ready at all
times for a well-cooked meal. I took advantage of that mentioning
of appetite by calling the attention of Madam Pike and
her assistant to it. They had each positive and personal knowledge
that as far as appetite and sleep went, I was in beautiful
health; and I added: “Now, Madam Pike, are the other
complaints as weak <i>in their strength</i> as this letter? If you,

PRESIDENT MCKINLEY on the sixth day of this month
was assassinated. I had learned the news on the day I was
landed here. To-day when we learned of his death, sorrow
and many tributes of loving sympathy were expressed for the
President, as also for her who, as widow, wept over the loss
of the people's chosen PRESIDENT.
