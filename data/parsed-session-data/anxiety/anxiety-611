<b>M</b>y friend Barb calls to ask if Matthew can take a drive with
her family up to Tahoe for the day. Her son Kevin and Matthew
are best friends. "The kids will have fun playing in the
snow," she says. I think that getting away from video games for
a day will be good for Matthew. He is not enthusiastic about the
trip, but he agrees to go.


Nikolaus is also up in the mountains this weekend. He's
with his Scouts troop on their annual snow-camping outing,
which sounds like torture to me, but Nikolaus looks forward to
it. I don't know if Nikolaus had a chance to talk to his grandmother
before he left, but at least while he's up in the snow, he'll
have a respite.


"It will be good for you to have some time to yourself," Barb
says when she comes to pick up Matthew. "Read a book, go to a
movie, go shopping."

After they leave, I try to read a book, but I find myself reading
the same sentences over and over. I get to the bottom of the
page without a clue of what I've just read. I usually love to read
mysteries. I like them because no matter how messy the situation
is, it all gets neatly wrapped up in the end. Now when I try to read
a mystery, I find that the murders really upset me. I resent the
fact that everyone is so focused on finding out who did it. I want
to know how the family is doing, how they are coping. Mystery
stories never tell you that.


I try to watch television, but I can't seem to follow even the
simplest sitcom. I forget the set-ups, and I don't get the jokes. I
leave the TV on and pretend to watch it because it makes me feel
more normal. It's a cover for what I'm actually doing, which is
just sitting on the couch for hours, lost in my own thoughts.


Today, without Nikolaus and Matthew, freedom proves less
enticing than it sounded. I drive to the mall but find little that
holds my interest. The displays are filled with bright spring colors
I can't imagine wearing, and the mannequins all have an attitude
of aggressive happiness I could never maintain. Normally on a
free afternoon, I would go to a movie, maybe something romantic
that I know Nick and the boys wouldn't want to see. There's
a movie theater in the mall, and I consider checking out what's
playing. But I'm afraid that if I sit in the darkness, I'll spend the
two hours crying, so I head back to the car.


The sky is slate gray, heavy with the threat of rain. Fat drops
spot the windshield as I pull onto the freeway. This storm will
translate into snow in the mountains. I say a small prayer for
Nikolaus and Matthew to be safe.


At home, I shake off my coat and make a cup of tea. It is dark
outside, although it's only three in the afternoon. I wonder if the
storm will force the Scouts to break camp early. I wonder if Barb
and Mike have thought to bring tire chains.


At five, I turn on the outside lights. I don't expect Barb and

I pull out the Scouts' emergency phone tree and call the
person at the top, the one who would call everyone if something
happened, if there were some emergency. No one answers, and I
am reluctant to leave a message. There were no messages on my
machine when I got home from the mall, so they probably haven't
been trying to reach me. Just to make sure, I call the next number
down the tree.


"Haven't heard anything," the mom who answers the phone
says. "But they have enough food and gear to camp for a week
if they need to. I just hope the roads are clear so they can drive
home tomorrow."


These are the same roads that Matthew is on now. I wonder
if Barb and Mike will decide to stay rather than risk driving
home in this storm. The rain has not let up since this afternoon—
if anything, it's coming down harder. I stare at the phone, willing
Barb or Mike to call and say they are all safe at a motel
somewhere and will be back tomorrow. I try to ignore the mental
image of them with the two kids stranded in a snowdrift on
the side of the road—or worse, skidding across the highway in
that slow motion of accidents, spinning, spinning, glass shattering,
bodies slammed against each other, against the car, against
the road. The emergency road crew will find Barb's and Mike's

I make another cup of tea, trying to stay calm. It tastes
warm and slightly metallic, like blood. I am sure that something
has happened, I can feel it. When I hear the phone ring, I know it
can only be someone who will confirm what I already know. I try
to compose myself before I answer, but my voice shakes.


"What's wrong? You sound awful." It's Karin. I wonder why
they have chosen her to tell me the bad news, and then I realize
that her call has nothing to do with Nikolaus or Matthew.


"I'm waiting for a call from Nikolaus or Matthew," I tell her.
"I'm pretty sure something has happened to them." I tell her my
concerns about the storm in the mountains. I tell her about the
tea tasting like blood. Saying it out loud makes me sound a bit
crazy, but then Karin is the one person I know who has near-absolute
faith in signs, in intuition. I know she'll understand.


"Relax," she tells me. "You are getting all worked up over
nothing."


"Don't you think I should trust my intuition?" I say. "I feel
like I know in my bones that something bad has happened."


"What were you doing the morning Nick died?" she asks.


"I was working on a presentation for one of my clients."


"Did you have any idea that he had died?"


I try to remember what I was thinking, how I felt that morning,
before the neighbor came to the door, before I ran out to the
ambulance, before I went to the hospital. It's hard to do. The curtain
of memory between the before and after is ironclad, death's
harsh glare obscuring all that went before it with a deep shadow.
"I didn't even think he was dead when I first saw his body," I have
to admit.


"I think you can relax then. No offense, but I don't think
your intuition is all that great."

A sweep of light crosses the living room—headlights of a
car in the driveway. "I've got to go now," I say. "I think Matthew's
home."


"The roads weren't bad at all," Mike tells me, puzzled by the
prolonged hug I'm giving Matthew. "This storm is local. It's not
even snowing up in the mountains."
