BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  So you were going to tell me a little bit about, um, [NAME OTHER], where you were I think in college and how, um, I guess you had this boyfriend for what, 2 years in high school?
<b>PT:</b>	Two years, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And you talked recently about some of the positive aspects of the relationship and some of the negative aspects.  So you broke up with him how, months, 2 months, semester?
<b>PT:</b>	I, well, um, last, uh, fall semester it was the following second semester in February that we broke up.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, during that entire time I was building this really great friendship with another guy.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I felt like I didn't have to pretend to be anybody else.  I could be myself.  I liked who I was when I was with him.  Um, it felt like we were equals as opposed to my other relationship with the other guy who kind of treated me, um, almost like his daughter cause I had such a terrible childhood and I had such a horrible family life he just wanted to take care of me.  And it was good in some ways and he, you know, like I said earlier, he gave me, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	A place to eat, have regular meals, a family that was sort of stable, but in the long run he became very possessive and wanted me to dress a certain way and, uh, wanted only me to hang out with certain people.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I mean, so he kind of rescued you, but wanted to keep you kind of subservient.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Didn't let you kind of develop, um, so—
<b>PT:</b>	And of course at that time—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I thought I had the love of my life, that this was my savior, you know, like this was the guy who took me out of my crazy family house, you know, was trying—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, he did.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah he did.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, in a lot of ways he did, but he was just, um—
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, he was only [AGE], so I mean he was still kind of a kid too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but did, I mean, he just could only do so much.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And, uh, at that point he was just kind of keeping you back.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	From growing.
<b>PT:</b>	And that was one of the reasons why I—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Recognized that it was time for us to break up.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	However, in the meantime, though, I'd developed feelings for the other guy, uh, who, like I said, he was my equal—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	We were friends, I'd never once before been friends with a guy because I, well, actually this goes into sort of a long history of me being very scared of, to talking to guys and not having any sort of social contact with guys because I went to an all girls high school and when I was in grade school I was made fun of all the time from the boys because I was dirty and smelly, probably cause no one took care of us, you know.  And, um, I had really terrible asthma and allergies and was always sneezing and, you know, I was just, you know, the person that people picked on.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And I had really low self esteem back then.  And, um, so I had a very weird, well, actually kind of nonexistent relationship with men to begin with, and then by choosing to go to an all girl school, that actually made it kind of worse because I felt comfortable around girls but not around guys.  And that transcended into even my male teachers where I was too afraid to talk to them.
<b>DR:</b>	Hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, anyway, um, so sadly, uh, when the relationship ended with the first boyfriend, um, he kind of took it as this was just sort of a split up time before I, you know, got to my senses, became more independent, and then we would gradually, you know, get back together.  However, like I said before, I was really falling for the other guy.  Everything that I was missing or wishing that I had with a person, I had with him.  I didn't have to pretend.  I didn't have to, uh, worry about what I was going to say.  I didn't have to, like we just naturally had fun and we naturally clicked and I'd never had that experience with anybody, let alone a man of course.  I don't even know for that matter for a woman.  You know, that's why I think our relationship was so special.  Um, but either way, um, we decided to start dating.  And of course I didn't want to make it appear that I broke up with the first boyfriend for the other guy, which was his suspicion the entire time.  So we kept it secret.  And unfortunately one night, um, I think this was maybe a week, uh, like 4 weeks later after we had broken up, uh, the first boyfriend, uh, I guess he was listening at the door at my current boyfriend and we were making out and he bust through the door, um, started hitting, uh, my current boyfriend, screaming, um, I tried to pull him off, he was subsequently turned around and, um, hooked me in the jaw.  And—
<b>DR:</b>	Poked you?
<b>PT:</b>	No, punched.
<b>DR:</b>	Punched.
<b>PT:</b>	Punched me in the jaw.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, Jesus.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, he went nuts.  It was his like greatest suspicion confirmed.  He was also really, really sick so like he was on all sort of medication, not that I'm giving him an excuse, but he was very, very violent, you know, woke up the entire dorm, cops came, essentially arrest him, and he was breaking and entering, assaulting not 1 but 2 students.  Um, we all lived on the same floor so he had to immediately pack up his belongings.  But, um, what disappointed me through all this was that under those different conditions, um, you would think a normal college or normal university with this sort of a behavior, that they would have dismissed him, or expel him, or did something.
<b>DR:</b>	They let him stay there?
<b>PT:</b>	They let him stay there.  And they put a, um, university, um, what's that called when you, it begins with an R.
<b>DR:</b>	Restriction.
<b>PT:</b>	Like a restraining order, a university restraining order on him, and—
<b>DR:</b>	So he never got charged by the real police or he did?
<b>PT:</b>	No, he didn't.  Well, and that might have been, you know, I think at the time I felt like it was such a horrible situation that I didn't push for charges.  But I really felt the school was going to come in for us, and, but because I didn't mention this earlier, it was a mostly all female school, it's about 80% females, 20% guys, they were really trying to build up their population of guys.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	And because they wanted to keep guys around—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, he ended up getting community service, which he did.  But, um, what happened subsequently was that it turned into this huge issue, um, people were on his side and other people were on our side.  The most interesting thing is that the people who were actually there and actually saw what happened were on our side, as far as like how crazy he went.
<b>DR:</b>	Of course.
<b>PT:</b>	But I kind of, [NAME OTHER] and I kind of got, um, not ostracized, but to the point where, you know, people would look at us and whisper about us and, um, he was the theater department so the whole theater department of course was on his side.  They thought I was lying about him punching me.  Um, and in some ways, um, I kind of knew that it would, the whole college experience was never going to be the same because I got branded as that, you know, that girl who got 2 guys fighting over her, and, you know, I was, you know, of course called a whore and all these other things.  You know, this was my second boyfriend.  You know, the first one was the one who went with me to college and, you know, and I ended up marrying my second boyfriend, but in some ways, you know, and of course [NAME OTHER] parents didn't know, didn't know me.  And they were like, oh god, this girl got him in trouble, you know, he got assaulted.  He'd never been in a fight in his life, you know.  And I don't know how they felt about me.  But, um, in the long run, it actually brought us closer together because we had this experience of, you know, we were both, um, this traumatic experience actually brought us closer together.  And we, you know, we've been together 9 years now and been married for 2 years, so, um, it's kind of a crazy story, but in the long run I think under those circumstances even if that crazy, you know, experience happened I don't think, I think we'd still be together.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you stay there all 4 years?
<b>PT:</b>	I was there all four years because I was, well, for one thing I also changed my major to biology—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So it was an entirely different class of students who didn't know my background, who didn't know what happened before.
<b>DR:</b>	Was it a big enough school?
<b>PT:</b>	Big enough that, you know, different departments, I mean, [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Did he stay?
<b>PT:</b>	He stayed too.  He stayed too.
<b>DR:</b>	He left you alone?
<b>PT:</b>	He left me alone.  He, um, well, he, the crazy part is that one of my best friends from high school, um, ended up going there and, um, decided with him that, you know, his story was the right one and, you know, accused me of being a liar and, you know, they ended up getting married.  Yeah.  And they got divorced, you know, 2 years later, but and it just goes to show you—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you ever talk to her?
<b>PT:</b>	We kind of made amends actually the very last day after we graduated college, we both ran into each other.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, she, that was before they got married?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  That was before they got married.
<b>DR:</b>	You haven't talked to her since they got divorced?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, through MySpace, saying hi.  I mean, she's in Europe, he's Japan doing voice overs.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Anyway, all that situation aside, that's the background history between me and my husband where we had that kind of traumatic experience that sort of led us together and it was sort of, I mean, as bad as it was and, you know, all the ridicule and whispering and rumors that went around, it actually kept us closer together.  And I think to this day, you know, when people see us we hope that they don't think like, oh they just stayed together because of that really crazy experience, just proving everybody wrong, that it was really true love, that our actions since then speak louder than that incident, you know, that we really do love each other, we moved in together during college.  And we've been together ever since.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you know, you know what the deal is, right?  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	That's what's important.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but that's the background history.  I thought I told you about it.
<b>DR:</b>	You told me some—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But it's different.  I mean, I know you better now than before and it's like I think I was in, not exactly shocked, but this was like a minor compared to, it's not minor, I don't know if you told me the details like this exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	No, probably not, because—
<b>DR:</b>	Compared to your upbringing and your family, God, um, all right.  So the Vyvans?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Actually I wrote some notes on it.  I wrote it in the waiting room.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, did it, oh, in the waiting room?
<b>PT:</b>	And so in general it is giving me longer focus times.  However, I found it's most effective from like nine a.m.  To four p.m., so I take it at seven a.m.  However, it's harder because when I go to work, um, we have so many meetings and because it's cubicle life people stop in and stop out and people like to socialize that I can't get my work done because these interruptions, all these meetings.  So I've decided that, um, and I'm allowed to do this, people will sometimes put up little, you know, slips of paper going across their cubicle saying, you know, please e—mail if you need me, you know, whatever.  I need to work right now.  And I decided that's what I need to do.  Because during the times that I can actually focus and have the best ability to work I wanted to have that as my active work time.  I don't want to be bothered by, you know, oh, is anyone up for lunch or, you know, things like that.  So I, I took your recommendations, I gradually increased the dose and it was okay.  Uh, however, this weekend, um, I slept in and it was the first time when I was doing the full time dose and I didn't end up taking it until ten or eleven.  And unfortunately that's when I had the trouble sleeping that night.  Had trouble sleeping Saturday night and last night, actually, what I'm wearing right now is what a fell asleep in.  Yeah, okay.  But I know now—
<b>DR:</b>	What are you smoking?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah,  I know now—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah it's because you took it too late.
<b>PT:</b>	That it's, um, cause I took it too late.  So I know now I need to be more responsible that if I'm going to be on this medication I need to take it at the same exact time.
<b>DR:</b>	Or get a baggy—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Put in a little sticky or a piece of paper that says half dose—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Stick it in the baggy close it, if you get up at ten o'clock, take half of what's in there.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	Close it back up—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Stick the capsule in the baggy that says half—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	If you wake up at ten o'clock the next day you take that.  I mean, you have to figure out if it's before this time you can take a whole one.  If it's after, you take less.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, yeah.  That makes more sense than taking a whole one and being up until three in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, oh no, that's crazy.  But okay, the question is then what happens between four and five or five thirty when you're still at work?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm commuting home, so, um—
<b>DR:</b>	Doesn't, I mean, and at home?
<b>PT:</b>	At home it's difficult because I'm part of [NAME OTHER] choir and I sing.  Actually I dropped hand bells, so it's only really now, it used to be Wednesday night and Thursday night.
<b>DR:</b>	Not that I have anything against hand bells, but—
<b>PT:</b>	I did.
<b>DR:</b>	You dropped.
<b>PT:</b>	I did.
<b>DR:</b>	You dropped, it doesn't matter what it is, you dropped something.
<b>PT:</b>	And it wasn't out of guilt or, you know, like, I mean, I, cause that's what it—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel guilty dropping?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't feel guilty dropping.  That's what I meant to say.  Yeah.  So it's, I did it because it's the most responsible thing I need to do and I know there's other people who are interested in doing it.  And I know [NAME OTHER] a little bit disappointed because I'm a good sight reader and I can pick up stuff, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you can do it later, some other time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Right now.
<b>PT:</b>	It's insane right now.  I really can't.
<b>DR:</b>	This is, this is really amazing, you're actually—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm so glad you said that.
<b>DR:</b>	You're actually taking care of yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  Well, this is actually the first week where I'm doing it cause the last week was like, oh, I need a substitute, we need a substitute for me.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	He's disappointed but he understands?
<b>PT:</b>	He understands.  And he, and he told me—
<b>DR:</b>	And especially—
<b>PT:</b>	Frankly, he said, you know, I can put anybody's hands up, I need your voice, it's soprano, so, you know, it made me feel better too.
<b>DR:</b>	Unfortunately, I mean, it's his thing.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	He needs it, so partially that's more time that he's not with you.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It was a good step.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It was a really good step because I really did not need to be doing that.  And, um, it helps me if I want to stay until like six o'clock at work and, because,  it cycles at work.  Right now it's like a crazy busy time because, you know, farmers need to get their stuff and registered before, you know, the spring season, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Say that again.
<b>PT:</b>	The farmers need to get their pesticides registered before the spring season.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, for work, I'm like, what—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, for job, yeah.  Cause like I review all the data to.
<b>DR:</b>	On hand bells, and what are we talking about.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, you know, it's crazy.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And the best part is though I feel, uh oh, I didn't get to tell you though, um, I had my performance review last week and I busted my ass to put together, you know, a really good performance review where I sat down and went through my calendar and looked at all the things that I participated in and helped out in, whereas normally I would just, you know, like previous years I was like oh God, you know, and I didn't put, you know, I need to put 25% of the effort that I did in this one.
<b>DR:</b>	Wait, so you have to turn something in to them?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, a self evaluation basically.  Yeah, it's part of their, how they rank you and there's just five different levels and unsatisfactory, minimally satisfactory, fully successful, exceeds expectations, and outstanding.  And I put in all this stuff.  And because we have a new manager, um, she doesn't necessarily know everything that everyone's doing.  And when I put my report together, um, and I did it in a really cool format I think because I put it in table format with all the list of actions and then if I went to highlight a particular action where I went above and beyond, I would put a footnote on the bottom.  So it was really a good way as opposed to a narrative, um, and plus, you know, it's kind of science like, you know, to show my accomplishments.  And she told me she had no idea that I was doing all this stuff.  And, you know, and she wouldn't normally because, you know, the managers are managers.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, right, right, right.  Um.
<b>PT:</b>	And I got an outstanding.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, you don't give yourself a grade.
<b>PT:</b>	No, they do.  They do, yeah.  Yeah, and—
<b>DR:</b>	So I take it you didn't get into trouble with that last minute whatever?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm still not finished.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but you talked to, obviously you had to have talked to the guy.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what happened was the company, we actually found some deficiencies—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And we had to go back to the company and say we have to stop the deal until you adjust these deficiencies.  So that bought me much more time.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but now, thinking back was actually a legitimate,  so I'm going to be working like crazy until the end of this week.  But, you know, I'm still paying for the consequences of my ADD and, you know, low self esteem and depression, anxiety, and all that.  You know, months prior to this, I mean, this was a year long project and—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, but you can do it.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like I can do it now—
<b>DR:</b>	As opposed to—
<b>PT:</b>	And yeah, 'cause like I told you before
<b>DR:</b>	So—
<b>PT:</b>	It just seems so overwhelming—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And so distracting that I couldn't even work on it because—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right.
<b>PT:</b>	It just seemed like too much and now I'm actually breaking it up and setting goals each day saying I'm going to attack this portion and that's my goal for the day.  And I'm actually getting things done in small packages—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And ultimately it's leading to the end result, you know, of the finished product, so that is the major difference.
<b>DR:</b>	It's unbelievable.  And your mood is good, you're not depression and all that stuff?
<b>PT:</b>	It's, yeah, it's better.  It makes me wonder if like the symptoms of depression/anxiety was linked to the ADD cause I'm taking medication for both, you know, the depression and anxiety and it makes me wonder if those are actually symptoms of the ADD.
<b>DR:</b>	There are at least—
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like they're tied together.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  At least exacerbated by it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, because I was—
<b>DR:</b>	You can't trust yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't know what you're going to do or not do, so—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and I would get mad at myself or I'd, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Get anxious because I didn't do this or I, you know, would end up just crying all night [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, it's really dramatic, so—
<b>PT:</b>	And the craziest part is, I mean, this is too much and [INAUDIBLE] but I definitely I see a difference in enough that, um, you know, I'm not calling this a pan of fear or anything, but, um, it's I think having accumulative effect where like sort of cascading sort of, you know, like—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's giving you a chance.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It really work, I mean, the medicine isn't doing the stuff.  You're doing it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's just giving  you the ability to concentrate and to work at something productive with that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I feel it's—
<b>DR:</b>	The fact that you're actually putting this thing up in front of you [INAUDIBLE], that's amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	I know.  Actually I was the first person to do that, and people have been coming by saying, hey, can you make me one of those signs?  And I said it's just a piece of paper.  You can make it yourself.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I know.  That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	I did make one for the team leader though.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  So let's see you in whatever it is.  Do you have more appointments?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, 3 weeks from now.
<b>DR:</b>	Three weeks, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like these smaller sessions are better than anything I've had, that we—
<b>DR:</b>	Smaller?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, not smaller.  Um, you know, how sometimes you get an hour of therapy long session.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, oh, oh.
<b>PT:</b>	But smaller medication management session.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but these are—
<b>PT:</b>	More helpful.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.
