<font size="4"><b>Chapter 5: Surviving Monoculturalism and Racism: A Personal and Professional Journey</b></font>

DERALD WING SUE


THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, I have been constantly reminded that my racial
and cultural heritage are quite different from many in this society. Some of
these reminders have been quite pleasant and validating; many, however,
serve to invalidate, diminish, and strike at the core of my racial identity. As
a person of color, I have been exposed to prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination.
Surviving monoculturalism and racism has helped shape not
only my personal identity but my professional one as well. In this chapter, I
would like to share with you some of the lessons I have learned about prejudice
and discrimination, especially as it relates to growing up culturally different
in a predominantly monocultural society.


<b>BEING DIFFERENT
IN A MONOCULTURAL SOCIETY</b>


 My first recollections of racial taunting occurred to me when our family
moved to the southeast district of Portland, Oregon, a predominantly White
community. Prior to moving, we lived in Chinatown where my brothers
and I attended Chinese schools. I recall my first day at the new school.

[p. <i>46</i>]

 I was standing in front of my third-grade classroom speaking to my brother
Stan in Chinese. The teacher stepped out to close the classroom door when
she overheard our conversation. Giving me a disapproving look, she turned
to me and stated, "Derald, you're in America! When you're in America you
speak English. Get into the room now." Words cannot describe the shame
and humiliation I felt. What had I done wrong? Why was speaking Chinese
bad? The feeling of shame was magnified because it came from a teacher, a
role viewed with considerable respect by Chinese culture. When I returned
home that afternoon, my mother spoke to me in Cantonese. I remember being
curt with her and stating angrily that I never wanted to speak Chinese
again because that was the reason why people wouldn't accept us.


At the time of the incidents, I could not fully understand the meaning
and impact they had on me. All I discerned was that being different was undesirable.
It led me to conclude that these differences were seen as "bad,"
"deficits," and something to be avoided. As a result, I tried my best to become
invisible and/or to blend in with everyone else. Further, when you realize
that language is the carrier of one's culture and when one is made to
feel ashamed of his/her own language, it is little wonder that many persons
of color grow up feeling there is something wrong with them. These early
experiences, however, have taught me two valuable lessons that now form
the basis of my work.


<b><i>Lesson 1</i></b>


Monolingualism and monoculturalism are valued in this society. People
who differ in race, culture, and ethnicity are constantly given messages
that they are "deviant" and "abnormal." Later in life as I began to study psychology
and human behavior, I came to realize that "ethnocentric
monoculturalism" was an extremely powerful, insidious, and pervasive
force that was institutionalized in all aspects of U.S. society. In our profession
of psychology, for example, I have found that the standards of practice
and codes of ethics for psychologists are culture-bound and that they unjustly
portray racial/ethnic minority cultural values as unhealthy and potentially
abnormal. Take, for example, Asian American culture, which
values collectivism and the notion of interdependence, where the psychosocial
unit of identity resides with the family, group, or collective society.
At the other extreme are Western values of individualism, independence,
and the separation of the self. Most persons of color, because of their
collectivistic orientation, may be perceived by Western standards as dependent,
immature, and unhealthily enmeshed in the family.

[p. <i>47</i>]

<b><i>Lesson 2</i></b>


Societal pressures for conformance, assimilation, and acculturation
(melting pot myth) can do great harm to the culturally different in our society.
It may lead to seeing one's physical, behavioral, social, and cultural
characteristics as a handicap to be overcome, something to be ashamed of,
or something to be denied, and it may lead to negative racial/cultural attitudes,
feelings, and behaviors. This was certainly true for me during my
early years where I yearned to be either invisible or tried to behave "White"
in order to gain acceptance from my schoolmates or peers. I tried to dissociate
myself from the Chinese community, prided myself in "speaking good
English," and worked out with weights constantly to combat the image of
the "weak and frail" Chinese characters portrayed on television.


<b>STEREOTYPES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM</b>


 As a freshman entering Washington High School, I was assigned a counselor,
Mr. Knutsen, a well-respected math-science teacher. During the second
week of class, he called me into his office and advised me to take a
sophomore honors course in physics. Mr. Knutsen stated that he had looked
at my past school records and was going to make an exception in having the
first freshman ever to take the experimental science course. While I felt flattered,
I was also very apprehensive about my ability to compete against advanced
sophomore students. Noticing my hesitation, Mr. Knutsen turned
to me and said, "Derald, I know you're worried about whether you can
handle the course. I want you to know that I have faith in you. You won't
have any trouble because <i>you people are good at that!</i>"


I remember my conflicted feelings: grateful to the counselor for his desire
to help me and yet strangely uncomfortable. For some reason, I felt
trapped. It was only years later that I realized the basis of these feelings. Mr.
Knutsen harbored strong stereotypes of Asian Americans: He perceived us
as good with numbers and good in the sciences and technology; I was later to
discover that he also believed Asians to be "poor in people relationships,"
"inarticulate," and to "make poor managers." For many years I believed
these stereotypes about myself. Were it not for an opposing experience in
college, I might today be an unhappy physicist or chemist.


<b><i>Lesson 3</i></b>


The power of preconceived notions, images, and stereotypes may trap
and track individuals into directions not of their own choosing. Furthermore,
victims of pervasive stereotyping may come to believe in them.
Throughout high school and most of my college years, I avoided classes in
humanities and social sciences because I truly believed I could not handle
"people oriented" courses. It was only late in my junior year of college that
graduation requirements forced me to take several psychology and anthropology
courses. To my surprise, I found them not only fascinating but

[p. <i>48</i>]

<b>GOOD INTENTIONS AND THE INVISIBILITY OF RACISM</b>


<b><i>Lesson 4</i></b>


Even the most well-intentioned teacher, counselor, or person inherits
racial biases. No one is immune from inheriting the racial prejudices of his
or her forebears. Since Euro-Americans are products of their cultural conditioning,
they are often socialized into oppressor roles. In many ways, they
are also victims. My many experiences with White folks make me realize
that they were not born into this society with a conscious desire to be bigoted
or racist. My counselor, Mr. Knutsen, was not a mean and evil person
intent upon harming me or any other person of color. He was not consciously
aware of the stereotypes he harbored, nor was he aware of the negative
consequences it might have had on me. Indeed, what makes this
situation so problematic was that Mr. Knutsen meant well, his intention to
help me was honorable, and he spent extra time and effort to bend the rules
to "benefit me." This is precisely why it is difficult getting White folks to
realize that their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors may oppress and hurt others.
Because they experience themselves as moral, decent, and fair-minded
individuals, they find it intolerable to view themselves as oppressors.


<b>MICRO-INVALIDATIONS AND MICRO-ASSAULTS</b>


 Arriving in Washington to keynote a conference, I hailed a taxi at the airport.
The driver started an analysis of the controversial outcome of the
Holyfield-Tyson heavyweight fight the day before. We were engaged in a
very interesting discussion when he made an offhand comment: "You
know, you speak excellent English."


Later that day, after finishing my keynote address before a large primarily
White audience, several attendees approached me to ask questions and
make comments. One White women asked me, "Where were you born?" I
replied, "Portland, Oregon." She smiled and restated her question. "No, no,
I mean, where were you really born ... what country?" I answered, "The
United States." She looked embarrassed and quickly left the podium.


That evening, I went to dinner with a White colleague, Dave, whom I
considered an enlightened friend. As we entered the restaurant, the hostess

<b><i>Lesson 5</i></b>


People of color grow up in a society that constantly invalidates them.
The overt and intentional acts of bias and discrimination can greatly damage
both the psyche and the physical health of minorities, but it is the daily
slights, invalidations, and assaults that may in the long run prove much
more harmful. As an Asian American, I continue to be viewed as an alien in
my own land. Both the taxi driver and the conference attendee were probably
"good people" who either meant to compliment me and/or were curious
about me, but their comments and questions reveal a biased mind-set:
Only White, blue-eyed people and/or those who fit a certain image are considered
"real Americans." All others who are of a different color are perceived
as not "real citizens" of this country. Admonitions such as "if you
don't like it here, go back to______________[China, Mexico, Africa, etc.]"
reveal ethnocentrism of the most damaging kind. These slights represent
what is called "micro-assaults." Such assaults occur when people of color
are perceived as aliens in their own land, when their physical, linguistic,
racial, or cultural differences are considered undesirable or deviant, when
their experiential reality is invalidated, or when persons of color are accused
of being overly sensitive and paranoid for raising issues of potential
bias. Most racial/ethnic minority groups have been exposed to many forms
of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination; some are overt and deliberate,
but most are unintentional "micro-assaults." This term refers to individual
acts that alone may appear quite benign or of low impact, but
collectively, over an extended period of time, can do much psychological
harm to marginalized groups in our society.


<b>OVERT RACISM AND MACRO-ASSAULTS</b>


 On December 15, 1995, my family and I were subjected to one of the most
horrendous experiences of our lives. The police in our city obtained a search
warrant for our home, broke down the front door, and claimed to have recovered
stolen city equipment. They accused my 19-year-old son, who was
attending USC at the time of the incident, of taking the equipment without
their knowledge or permission. Upon his return from college, he was

[p. <i>50</i>]

I am not a naive person and certainly not a newcomer to prejudice and
racism. Yet when this incident occurred, I hoped that the charges were the
result of a monumental misunderstanding that could be quickly clarified.
However, the severity of the police actions in breaking down our door and
the many contradictory facts that were uncovered made such a belief difficult
to entertain. After eliminating every possible reason for their actions,
we concluded that it smacked of racism and anti-Asian sentiment.


<b><i>Lesson 6</i></b>


Racism is most likely expressed against individuals who violate the
normative structures of society and who challenge the system. Let me
briefly outline the basis of this lesson.


My family and I reside in a city that is predominantly White; Asian
Americans are the largest racial/ethnic minority group, comprising 15% of
the general population and 20% of the public schools' enrollment. The
community is very affluent and conservative, with minimal knowledge or
awareness of diversity and multicultural issues. My wife and I have been
very active in the community, helped form the City Asian American Club,
did pro bono work for the schools on multicultural education, sponsored
community forums on racism, voiced our concerns in the past about police
harassment of Asian and African American youths in the community, and
spoke against the failed formation of the Caucasian Students Union at the
high school. As a result, these activities made us highly visible in the community
and potential targets of a backlash.


It became evident that my son had been set up for the sequence of
events that followed. Prior to his attending college, he was the volunteer
emergency coordinator for the city and worked closely with the fire and police
departments. His technical knowledge was very high and he often repaired
and serviced ham radios and other communication equipment
owned by the city. This equipment was frequently brought over by the fire
department; they knew we possessed them. When the break-in and arrest
occurred, we were left with many questions.


First, why didn't representatives of the fire or police departments simply
pick up the phone and ask for the return of the equipment? Why did the
police choose such extreme measures to intrude into the home of a family
known in the community and certainly known by both departments? According
to a judge-neighbor, the forced entry into someone's home is only
done when drugs are involved (which can be flushed down the toilet or

[p. <i>51</i>]

Second, we later discovered that false statements had been made. For
example, fire department personnel stated that policy forbids the possession
of emergency equipment by a private citizen. If it was against department
policy, why did the firemen violate their own rules? Additionally,
some of our neighbors were willing to testify that they witnessed fire trucks
carrying the equipment over. Why did the fire department personnel misrepresent
the situation?


The possible answers to these questions are quite disturbing. For example,
many of our friends have asked whether such intrusive police actions
would have been carried out against a White family. Were we being targeted
because of our work in the community? Was this a not-too-subtle message
being sent to the Asian American community? While I would never wish
such an experience on any family, we have come away from this incident
with new insights.


First, my family has always known that our minority status in this society
subjects us to various forms of prejudicial actions and stereotypes. Yet
to work for social justice and equity and to challenge the prevailing biased
practices of a community can invite retaliation of the most extreme kind. It
is important for all of us to be prepared and to realize that working for social
justice is not an easy task and can take an awesome toll.


Second, fighting racism requires the help and support of many. We
could never have survived this terrible ordeal without neighbors, relatives,
friends, and colleagues stepping forward. Within weeks of the incident, letters
and calls on our behalf from our pastor, the superintendent of public
schools, the city Asian American Club, and other neighbors went to both
the mayor's and the district attorney's office. Especially effective were letters
from my colleagues representing the Asian American Psychological
Association, the Association of Black Psychologists, the Rainbow Coalition,
and the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues.
I am especially grateful not only for their moral support but also the strong
letters denouncing the police actions and questioning whether racism was
involved.


Third, unfortunately, fighting racism also requires the financial resources
to hire the best help possible. Directly after the breaking down of
our door and prior to my son's arrest, we were fortunate to hire a nationally
prominent African American civil rights attorney who had represented
Rodney King. He, in turn, quickly placed one of his private investigators on
the case and was able to obtain statements from potential witnesses. With
these actions, we communicated strongly to the city that we had the

[p. <i>52</i>]

Fourth, Asian Americans face a peculiar situation not often shared by
their African American counterparts. The perception that many have of our
group is that we are "quiet," "passive," "won't rock the boat," and "avoid
the limelight." While many of our cultural values related to subtlety, indirectness,
and working toward consensus are extremely valuable attributes
in many situations, it may invite retaliation in a strange sort of way. I cannot
prove it, but I believe that when the police officers arrived at our home
they were consciously or unconsciously influenced by this stereotype and
took personal liberties in breaking down our door.


Finally, fighting racism requires <i>not taking</i> the easy way out. It would
have been much simpler to have my son accept the 10 days of community
service in exchange for dismissal of the charges. We would have avoided the
large expenditure of financial resources and the many months of worry and
anguish. We chose to fight because our son was innocent, because these actions
had larger racial implications, and because we had the support of
many.


<b>COMBATING RACISM AND MONOCULTURALISM:</b>


<b>DOING THE RIGHT THING</b>


Because of these experiences, I have become keenly aware of the damaging
consequences of racism, the widespread stereotypes about Asian
Americans (good in math/sciences but poor in people relationships), how
physical differences could be objects of scorn, how our culture and lifestyles
are often equated with being non-normative, how minorities are often
perceived as aliens in their own country, and how the system can be
used to "hurt" or "intimidate" those who fight for social justice. Coping
with monoculturalism and racism has helped shape not only my personal
identity but has played a large part in my desire to study the causes, effects,
and methods to ameliorate overt and covert forms of prejudice and discrimination.
These experiences have made me aware of the great psychological
toll that racism takes on persons of color. It can result in low self-esteem,
feelings of rage, depression or hopelessness, anxiety, lowered school performance,
health problems, and countless other negative life consequences. I
often wondered what caused racism, why people were so intolerant of others,
and what we could do to combat bigotry. These questions have been the
focus of my research in the field of multicultural education and psychology.


When I was invited to testify before President Clinton's Race Advisory
Board in 1998, I shared with them the results of my work on multicultural
psychology and race relations. Among many of the points I made were the
following:

[p. <i>53</i>]

 Bigotry and racism continue to be two of the most divisive forces in our
society.


 The need to address issues of race, culture, and ethnicity has never been
more urgent.


 Most citizens of this nation seem ill-equipped to deal with these topics.


 Racial legacies of the past continue to affect current policies and practices of
the present, creating unfair disparities between racial/ethnic minority and
Euro-American groups.


 Such inequities are often so deeply ingrained in American society that they
are nearly invisible.


 The greatest challenge this nation faces is how we can become a multicultural
society that values equal access and opportunity.


tural Our greatest hope toward solving the problems of prejudice and discrimination
lies in the field of <i>multicultural education</i>.


The challenge confronting our profession and the nation is not an easy
one. It means major changes at the individual level where each and everyone
of us (educator, student, employer, employee, law enforcement officer,
etc.) needs to confront our biases and prejudices. It means major changes in
our institutions and organizations (educational systems, business and industry,
judicial system, law enforcement agencies, health care, etc.), where
the current policies, practices, programs, and structures serve to deny equal
access and opportunity to one group while unfairly benefitting another. It
means major changes in our society where public policies that promote
multiculturalism are instituted (affirmative action, bilingual education,
legislation banning racial profiling, etc.) and those that block multiculturalism
are eliminated.


I have also learned that our lives must become a "have to" in being constantly
vigilant to manifestations of bias in ourselves and in people around
us. While attending workshops and receiving continuing education on
multiculturalism are helpful, we must take responsibility to initiate personal
growth experiences in the real world. I am convinced that education
and training programs must somehow build learning experiences for students
that require personal growth through lived reality and experience.
Eliminating bias and prejudice cannot be just an intellectual exercise.


In closing I would only remind all of us that race, culture, and ethnicity
are functions of every person's development and not limited to "just minorities."
As psychologists and educators, we need to recognize that culture is
central to everything we do and that we are all representatives of our own
cultures. Producing a multicultural society that values diversity is our
greatest challenge. How we meet the challenge professionally will determine
the viability and relevance of the educational field. How we meet the
challenge as individual citizens will also foretell the legacy we leave our
sons and daughters. Continuing to deny the importance of multiculturalism
is to deny social reality itself. Let us meet the challenge honestly not
