<b>THIRTY-TWO YEARS<br />
OF THE<br />
LIFE OF AN ADVENTURER.</b>


I WAS born in the city of New York, October
11th, 1814. My father, for several years previous
to this time, commanded a vessel sailing
out of that port to various parts of England and
Ireland, until the war broke out between the
United States of America and Great Britain. His
vessel was captured, and himself and crew were
made prisoners and confined on board a British
man-of-war about seven months; submitting to
treatment, during a portion of that time, the most
painful and degrading. But being a man of strong
mind and active disposition, my father bore his
sufferings with manly fortitude, until himself and
crew were exchanged for English prisoners. On
their way to the United States, they were recaptured
by an English vessel; and while at
anchor off the eastern coast of North Carolina,
he and another brave spirit, at the hazard of their

At the close of the war, my parents removed
with their family to Tompkinsville, Staten Island,

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00007&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the age of five years I commenced my studies
at school. Being fond of books, I made rapid
progress in my juvenile studies, and soon began
to entwine myself round the heart of my fond
mother, and became the hope of an indulgent
father.


Nothing remarkable occurred until I had arrived
at the age of ten years, or thereabouts. My
father happening to be absent from home on
business in city, during the winter, about mid-night,
a gentleman residing about half a mile from
my father's house, arose from his bed and looked
out of the window, in the direction of our domicil,
and discovered a great light. He immediately

A short time after this, being fond of sport as
well as literature, I procured a piece of twine,
lead, and fish-hooks, and repaired to the end of a
long dock, commonly known as the steamboat
landing, seated myself on the string piece, with
my legs hanging over the water, and commenced

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00009&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first act of disobedience to my parents,
within my recollection, occurred on a Sabbathday,
when I was about eleven years of age. A
party of pleasure had arranged to go on a fishing
excursion, and my eldest brother and myself asked
my father's permission to go, which he positively
refused. We persisted in our determination and
went; and, on our return home, were severely
punished by my father; in connection with which
he delivered us a long and pathetic lecture on the
consequences of Sabbath-breaking, and disobedience
to his parental authority, which lecture made
a more lasting impression upon our minds than
the Hogging we received upon our backs. Having
been brought up to attend Sabbath-school,
and the instruction of religious teachers, my mind
was early impressed with the importance of religion.
In company with a young friend and
associate of my infant days, at or about the age
of twelve years, we were swinging on a scup
which was attached to two poplar trees, and while
performing various feats we were precipitated to
the ground, I falling upon my head; from which

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this time I determined on having another
fishing excursion; accordingly, a number of us
young boys procured a small boat, and bent our
course for Robin's Reef, a distance of about four
miles from our homes. We arrived at the point
in safety, and after hours spent in the vain hope
of obtaining even a “bite,” we concluded to
weigh anchor; when the wind commenced blowing
almost a hurricane. We rowed for the nearest
point of land, and on nearing Bergen Point,
while I was standing up in the boat, by a lurch I
was suddenly precipitated again into the briny
element. I made my way for the shore, which
I succeeded in a very short time in regaining,
and amused myself, with my young companions,

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On a beautiful morning, I set out with my
father on a hunting excursion, at a time of the
year when Na ure had clothed the trees of the
forest with verdant beauty, and the feathered
songsters uttered their shrill notes of music, which
fell delightfully upon the ear,--all calculated to
soften the heart with sympathy, and excite the
organ of sublimity, at the same time filling the
mind with a reverential awe toward God, the
giver of every good and perfect gift. I could not
help upbraiding my father at this time, for slaying
the little birds, whose voices uttered such melodious
sounds; but his feelings of sympathy had
become blunted by age and other circumstances,
and my reproof was little heeded. He, however,

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Having now nearly completed my education,
my father questioned me with reference to my
future prospects, and manifested a great desire to
know what calling or profession I had fixed upon
for a livelihood. I told him I was rather undecided
whether to select the profession of an artist
(having made great proficiency in the art of drawing
and painting), or choose the mercantile life.
He and my fond mother thought I should, in all
probability, become very eminent as an artist;
but after thoroughly canvassing the matter in my
own mind, I came to the conclusion that this
profession was too humble an occupation for an
individual of so much importance as I felt myself
at this time; having had the organ of self-esteem
pampered by my parents, who set greater store by
me than any of their children; which indulgence
caused them, in after life, to weep bitter tears
over their own folly. I accordingly told my
father that I should choose the mercantile life, to

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I now found I was deprived of all ray favorite
employments, and obliged to remain in the office
from morning till night, except when I was sent
out to collect bills, or transact any other business
for my employer, who was a very humane and
feeling man, and a thorough scholar. He also
had a very interesting and motherly lady for his
wife, together with a large and interesting family
of children. I boarded in the family with them
during my stay, which was very brief, and tried
to make myself satisfied with my lot; but as I
grew older I grew more restless and wavering in
my disposition. About three months after I engaged

In a short time after this, while on my way
from New York to Staten Island, on board a
steamboat, one Sabbath afternoon, in the act of
leaning over the companion-way, I lost my equilibrium,
and was precipitated into the cabin, my
head coming in violent contact with the floor. I
was carried on the deck for dead, and did not exhibit
any signs of returning consciousness for
about an hour afterwards; but by bleeding, and
other necessary remedies, I was again restored to
the embrace of my too fond mother. Being now
nearly fifteen years of age, and growing very impatient

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On my arrival at home, my father, brothers,
and sisters retired to rest, and left me alone with
my mother. She commenced conversation immediately--inquired
into the state of my mind,
tried to console me by quoting passages of Scripture,
pointing me to Christ as the only means by
which salvation might be obtained, and wound up
by a solemn and pathetic prayer to God, that he
would, for Jesus' sake, pardon my sins. On
arising, she said, “Oh! my son, I hope you will
now give your heart to God, and devote the
remnant of your days to his service; as faithfullly,
at least, as you have devoted these last few years
to serving the devil.” My heart being too full
for utterance, I retired to my boarding-house
without making any reply to her. For six weeks
I remained in that awful state of despair, closely
watched by my mother, and prayed for by the
more spiritual portion of the church to which she
had the privilege of being attached. One beautiful
Sabbath morning, I repaired with my mother
to church, a distance of two miles and a half from

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The time being fixed for the administration of
this solemn ordinance, on the next Sabbath, at
the Quarantine Ground, and all the preliminary
arrangements having been made, the fact was very
generally circulated, which had a tendency to
bring together a large concourse of people, many
of whom were my young associates in sin. The
day being somewhat cloudy, and the ceremony
impressive, it induced a great solemnity to pervade
the minds of the listening and attentive
spectators, many of whom were members of

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I gave myself up to secret devotion and prayer
to my Heavenly Father during the week, that
he would guide me by his unerring wisdom, and
that I might not be permitted to wound his cause
by any unholy act. On the following Sabbath,
the pastor, on behalf of the church, extended to
me the right-hand of fellowship, when I sat down
to partake of the elements of Christ's broken
body and shed blood. Oh! how sweet I then

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About this time, my mind became seriously
occupied with a desire to preach the gospel; and
after relating my impressions to my beloved pastor
and his consort (the latter of whom I shall
have occasion to mention frequently) they replied,
that if God had a special work for me to perform,
he would grant me more grace and wisdom, to
qualify me for the important undertaking. I continued
to pray for more grace and wisdom, that I
might have a proper understanding of the Scriptures,
and be enabled to hold up a crucified Saviour

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At length I began to mark the careless manner
of life of many of the old members of the church;
who, at one time at least, seemed to have the form
of godliness, but now, by their unholy lives,
seemed to deny the power thereof. These powerful
circumstances had a pernicious influence on
my mind; in consequence of which, I began to
neglect my devotional duties, and, in a little while,
I was filled with doubts about the reality of the
Christian religion. Shrouded in darkness and
gloom, I fell into a desponding state of mind,
which affected my brain and internal organs; and,
in a very short time, I became very troublesome
to my employer, and also to my friends. I would
sometimes refuse to labor; and, in one instance,
went off, in a fit of anger, into the country, and
remained one entire week, which occasioned him
to use severity towards me. I continued to grow
restless and dissatisfied, until, at length, my father
was prevailed upon to break my indentures, when

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“She saw me coming back--<br />
She saw, and ran and smiled,<br />
And threw her arms about the neck<br />
Of her rebellious child!”--

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This circumstance filled my mind with rage;
and stepping on the outside of the first gate, I
there remained a short time, lying in wait for him,
determined in my own mind on having revenge.
In a few moments he made his appearance, when
I immediately threw off my coat and challenged
him to combat, which challenge he did not accept,
when my mind became maddened with rage, and
I would in all probability have killed him, had it
not been for the interference of three gentlemen
present, who seized hold of me, and conducted
me into the cell. On thrusting me in, I gave the
door a tremendous kick with my foot, which
caused it to separate from the casement and fall
to the floor. By this time a large number of persons
had collected together, some to laugh, and
others to pity me for the wreck of mind. Among

If time and space would permit, I would give
my kind reader a full account of all that I witnessed
while in this asylum; but I cannot. Suffice
it to say, however, that by the mercy of God,
and the kind treatment I received during my stay,
I was thoroughly restored to health and right
mind, but not to the enjoyment of religion. Having
been there about five weeks, I began to have
a longing desire for home; and having some
smattering knowledge of writing poetry, I sat
down one beautiful afternoon, and composed the
following lines on home:--


How dear to the heart is that hallowed retreat<br />
Where father, and mother, and children do meet,<br />
To breathe forth affections a Saviour hath given,<br />
Around that fair altar devoted to heaven.


Home, home! sweet, sweet home!<br />
There is no place like heaven, for that is my home.


But when far removed from the friends whom we love,<br />
As in sickness and sorrow, we mourn like a dove,<br />
For a blessing from heaven to revive and to cheer,<br />
When no father, nor mother, nor sister is near.


Home, home! sweet, sweet home! &amp;c.;


When bereft of our reason, our health, and our friends,<br />
Kindly near us an angel affection extends:<br />
Oh! how it relieves us from troubles and woes,<br />
When he wipes off the tear that in agony flows


Home, home! sweet, sweet home! &amp;c.;<br />

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dear Father in heavea, oh! hallow that home<br />
Prepared by thy angels, with a blessing to come,<br />
Through a Saviour so promised--a home in the skies,<br />
Which the poor always value, and the rich can't despise.


Home, home! sweet, sweet home!<br />
There is no place like heaven, for that is my home.


Preparations were now made for my return
home; when I set out with my oldest brother,
who was sent for me: we arrived in a few hours,
to the great joy of my parents and kind friends.
I remained at home a short time, but found a
difficulty in keeping my mind employed, as I had
lost the taste I formerly had for fishing and hunting;
I therefore, by the recommendation of Dr.
Hitchcock, went to New Brunswick, N. J., and
engaged with Mr. Voorhees, to work at my trade.
Not liking the place, I quitted it, and engaged
with a Mr. Skenck, where I worked for a short
time and was taken sick; and my board and doctor's
bill ran up to a considerable amount during
my illness. On my recovery, I determined to

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father provided me with a hammock, mattress,
and a good stock of sea-clothes; and my
mother, too, not forgetting her poor boy, furnished
me with a pot of pickles, and other delicacies
which sailors do not usually possess. The vessel
being now ready for sea, I clad myself in sailor's
garb, and cut considerable of a figure, I can assure
you; although the appearance of my face and
hands would seem to indicate that I was more fit
for a profession of a mere delicate nature than that
which I was about to enter upon. I went on
board in the dusk of the evening, and we weighed
anchor and set sail. After getting under way,
the captain ordered me up aloft, to loose the top-gallant
sails. I succeded in reaching the foretop,
but not being very expert in climbing, I could
not get any further up at this time, when he called
me a “land-lubber,” and ordered me to come
down, which order I promptly obeyed. The first

When our watch expired, the captain told me
to go forward, take the end of a rope, rap upon
the forecastle, and sing out, “Larboard watch
ahoy!” which I did in a stentorian tone, when
the men were soon on deck, and the starboard
watch went below. We turned in with our
clothes on, and after thinking of home a few moments,
I fell into the arms of Morpheus. Being
tired, I slept sweetly for four hours, when I was
suddenly roused by the gruff voice of an old

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the course of a few days I began to get quite
used to the manner of living. It might be proper
here to give you some idea of our bill of fare:--
On Sunday, beef and duff; Monday, beef and
pork; Tuesday, pork and beans; Wednesday, beef
and duff; Thursday, lobscouce; Friday, codfish
and potatoes; Saturday, beef and pork. Lest my
reader cannot understand the meaning of “duff,”
I will explain. It is simply flour and water,
shortened with slush and boiled in a bag; when
done, it is placed in a kid and set afloat in molasses.
At supper, we had cold meat and Yopan
tea, sometimes called by sailors, “studding-sail
boom tea,” on account of the large sticks which
are frequently found in it; this is also sweetened
with molasses, and at first has rather an unpleasant
taste; but sailors are obliged to get used to
eating and drinking anything set before them.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During the day, when the watch was not below,
the men were engaged in making sinnett for gaskets;
and would, in fair weather, overhaul and
repair the rigging. This part of seamanship, together
with furling sails, loosing the same, learning
the ropes, tacking ship, steering my trick at
the wheel, boxing the compass, &amp;c.;, I soon became
proficient in. On Sundays, no work is done
about the vessel except working her, which gives
the “jolly Jacks” an opportunity to mend and
wash their clothes, many of whom have a scanty
supply. I would frequently take my bible and
hymn-book in my hand on Sundays, and read to
the old sea veterans, which was received at first
with no degree of pleasure. They would frequently
call me “an old psalm-singer,” and accost me
with vulgar and unmeaning epithets; but by perseverence
on my part, their opposition soon ceased,
and they would listen to the contents of its sacred
pages with a seeming degree of pleasure. Nothing
remarkable occurred on our passage out; and,
after a reasonable time, I was sent up aloft, to spy
out land, and in a short time I informed the captain
that I espied something having that appearance,
on the starboard bow. He came aloft, and

But to return to my narrative. Having come
to anchor and furled sail, we were very much
annoyed by the natives--mostly negro women--
coming on board in their little boats--called, in
the West Indies, “gobars,”--for the purpose of
purchasing some portion of our cargo, which
consisted of flour, meal, beef, pork, fish, potatoes,
onions, &amp;c.;


In the course of a few days, our cargo was sold,
and our vessel discharged; and after supplying
her with ballast and water, we hoisted sail and
weighed anchor, bending our course for Rum Key,
an English island. On going out of the harbour
of St. Thomas, I lost my equilibrium, and fell
down into the hold of the vessel, striking my
head upon the chime of a cask, and receiving a
very severe wound, from which I suffered for a
few days. In the course of two or three days we
arrived at the place of our destination, and commenced
immediately taking in a load of coarse
salt, which was brought on board in boats, by the
male slaves, many of whom presented a horrible

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While our vessel was lying at anchor off this
island, I was frequently amused by witnessing the
negroes grease their heads and dive down into the
clear blue sea, a distance of thirty or forty feet,
after concks, the meat of which they used for
food, and the shells were sold to us, to adorn the
mantel-pieces of our parlours, when we should
arrive at home. One day, Captain Smith, Captain
Perry, and myself, took our small boat to go
fishing about half a mile from where our vessel
was lying at anchor. After catching a sufficiency
of fish we concluded to return, and on nearing
our brig we were hailed by the mate, who informed
us that our log-line had been hauled into
the sea, one end of which had been left hanging
overboard, with a large hook and a piece of pork
attached to it. We pulled rapidly for the reel,
and soon succeeded in coming up to it. Captain
Perry seized hold of it, and taking a turn round
one of the thwarts of the boat, he remarked that
the devil himself was at the other end of the line.
Being an old and experienced whaleman, he continued

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Being now ready for sea, We weighed anchor
and set sail for our beloved country. Nothing
occurred worthy of note until the eighth day, when
we made Cape Hatteras. Late in the afternoon,
the sky began to gather blackness, and gave signs
of a terrible storm. The captain ordered us to
furl all the sails except the foretop-sail, in which
there were two reefs taken, and the main spanker
set. In a very short time the wind blew a hurricane,
and the rain commenced to fall, the thunder
to roll, and the lightning to flash. The immense
billows reared their foaming crests, and
threatened each moment to engulph our ship--
a mere speck upon their vast and raging expanse
--as she plunged her way forward, and nobly
persevered in the deeperate struggle. Never,
while I live, shall I forget my feelings on this
occasion. The confusion and turmoil of the elements
seemed to threaten the dissolution of nature,
and the lightning, as it danced madly overhead,
momentarily lighted up the scene with an awful

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tossed upon life's raging billow,<br />
Sweet it is, O Lord, to know<br />
That thou did'st press the sailor's pillow,<br />
And can'st feel the sailor's woe.


Never slumbering, never sleeping,<br />
Though the night be dark and drear,<br />
Thou the faithful watch art keeping,<br />
“All, all's well” thy constant cheer.


And, though masts and sails be riven,<br />
Soon life's voyage will be o'er;<br />
Safely moor'd in heaven's wide haven,<br />
Where storms and tempests vex no more.


After the storm abated, the wind died away to
a moderate breeze, we again made sail, and
through the course of the day fell in with two
wrecks, which were abandoned. We boarded
one of them, took from her some pieces of fine
pork, a barrel of fish, and some buiscuit, together
with a small anchor and cable. Before leaving
her we knocked her dead lights in, for the purpose
of sinking her. Her colours were lying on deck,
and her masts, sails and rigging were cut away,
and were lying alongside; we saw a ship to the
leeward, and supposed she had taken off the crew.
After two days sail, we had to counteract another
storm, which was not quite so severe as the first,

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As our clothes were all wet, and had been so
for ten or twelve days, we were all more or less
affected with rheumatism; and being short-handed,
we now found it very difficult to manage our vessel;
but through the agency of a kind Providence,
we finally succeeded, after twenty-three days'
sail, in making Montauk Point, the east end of
Long Island. Reader, imagine my joy on again
beholding my native land, after the suffering and
toil of fifteen out of the twenty-three days we had
been at sea. We took a pilot on board, and came
to an anchor above Hell-gate, he not considering
it safe to go through that night. After the sails

On my arrival at home, with a rough, unseemly
exterior--my hands and face being burnt to the
consistency and appearance of a smoked ham--
my father, mother, brothers, and sisters crowded
round me, and greeted me with tears of joy at
my safe return; and, in a short and brief manner,
I related to them the history of my voyage. In

I do not intend to weary the patience of my

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After our vessel had undergone a thorough repair,
we took in a cargo, consisting of pine planks,
staves, shingles, and a yankee skipper, who proved
to be as mean a scoundrel as ever lived. To
serve the devil more effectually, he dared to assume
the livery of heaven. The vessel being
loaded and ready for sea, we took on board the
rest of our crew, consisting of a negro and two
North Carolina sailors, as green as pumpkins.
After setting sail, our brig glided slowly down
Pasquotanck River, till at length we reached
Albemarle Sound, and finally the “big blue herring
pond,” as the ocean is frequently termed by
“old salts.”


Nothing remarkable occurred during our passage
out to the West Indies. With fair weather
and a moderate breeze, we finally reached the
island of Martinique, belonging to the French.
We came to anchor and remained in the harbour
of St. Pierre's about two days. Not being able
to sell our cargo in this place, we got under weigh,
and bent our course for Point Peter, in the island
of Guadaloupe. After we had been out a few

A short time after we got ashore, I missed my
shipmates; and in strolling around in the public
square of the city, I supplied myself with an
abundance of West India fruits, of which I ate
freely; and afterwards falling in with some jovial
French sailors, I was invited to drink with them,

Just before we weighed anchor, the captain
ordered me to do something, which I did as well
as my feeble strength would permit; but not suiting
the gentleman's tastes, he became very angry;
and having a tumbler in his hand at the time, he
hurled it at me with such force that, on striking
my arm, the glass broke, and cut several large
pieces of flesh out of it. After his fit of anger
had subsided, he discovered that I was fainting
from weakness and loss of blood, and ordered the
mate to bind up my wounds. As soon as I recovered
from the shock, I promised myself that I
would have satisfaction out of him on my return
home; and on speaking to the men on the subject,
they called him a “d--d villain,” and said
they were prepared to testify against him. We
finally got under weigh, and set sail for the island
of St. Thomas, where we arrived in a few days.
Here we received orders to proceed to Myagues,

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was carried into a house which had the appearance
to me, similar to an American barn, laid
upon a bed, and on the following morning, was
visited by the doctor, who ordered my nurse (an
old Spanish woman) to lay two blisters on the
inside of my thighs, which was done, and internal
remedies applied; in a few days my fever took a
turn, I began to grow better, and in the course of
three weeks, I was able to go on board. During
my illness, I was visited by a number of Spanish
creole ladies daily, who were also catholics, and
whose hearts sympathised with the young American,
who was far removed from his native country,
and in a land of strangers. They would try
to comfort me by their assurances that I would

I told my father I was obliged to go to the city
that day with the vessel, when he advised me to
proceed home immediately as soon as the vessel
was made fast. I went down with my brother
to see Captain Wood, the custom house boarding
officer, who at my request kindly allowed me to
bring my tamarinds and cocoanuts on shore,
which my brother did, leaving me on board to
assist in carrying the brig to New York. The
health officer having previously examined our
vessel and crew, consented that we might proceed
to the city that day, which we did, and after a few
hours, our sails were all furled, and our vessel
made fast to the dock. On demanding my wages
of the captain, he refused to pay me, assigning as
a reason that he had expended it all in defraying

Reader, while I pen these lines, my heart swells
with grief, and my eyes are suffused with tears,
when I look back upon the death-bed scene of my
fond and doting parents, and beloved sister, now
fifteen years gone by. It may not be amiss to
state what were my feelings under those trying
circumstances. While I stood over my dying
mother, I remembered my acts of disobedience,
and the many tears I caused her to shed during
the former part of my life, on account of my way-wardness;
and when her pure spirit left its frail
tenement, I felt as though my heart would burst
with grief, during that night and the following day.
My worthy and esteemed friends, Mrs. Jane Ann
Martin, my cousin Mrs. Turner, and Mrs. Griswold,
were present and soothed her dying moments;
may I ever cherish their memory with
gratitude and respect, for their noble and generous
conduct on this occasion. On the following morning
after my eldest sister was taken with the disease,
those kind friends whom I have just named
had become weary for want of rest, I was advised
to go into the country a distance of five
miles, to get my cousin to come and take care of
the family. I accordingly went, but she refused
to come, fearing she might take the disease and

We moved to the city in May, and during this
year my wife embraced the Christian religion,
and united, with myself, to Elder Benedict's
church, in Stanton-street, New York. At the
close of the year, in consequence of my employer
being unsuccessful in business, he concluded to
close up his store in Old Slip, when I was thrown
out of business, and did not do anything again for
nearly six months, during which time I spent the
last dollar I was worth in the world. I finally
procured a situation in a pill-doctor's office, in
Chatham-street, at $4. per week. I staid with
him about four weeks, during which time he increased
my wages to $6. Having a great aversion

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shortly after I engaged with him, I removed,
through his persuasion, from the city to Williamsburgh,
with my family, about the middle of September,
1838, when a few Baptists got together,
and through the liberal pecuniary aid of Mr.
Withington and other Baptist friends, at length
succeeded in forming a church. Owing to a little
disagreement between myself and the preacher,
I was not constituted with them, but joined their
number shortly after. In a very short period, I
was elected clerk, and remained in this situation,
labouring for the cause of God and his church,
until the spring of 1844, when I was excluded
from the fellowship, in consequence of having
embraced and practsed the science of animal and
phreno-magnetism. From this time persecution
began to rage against me, which was brought
about in the following manner: Previous to my
exclusion from the body, a girl, by the name of

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day, at my store in Fulton-street, I
was informed that a story was in circulation in
Williamsburgh, that I had made improper proposals
to Miss Winter, and that I had attempted to
seduce her, she having told the story to a slandering
negro, who, in a very short time, set the
whole village to talking about it. I became very
much enraged on hearing this report, and came
over to the village for the express purpose of
having her arrested; but on advising with one of
our deacons upon the subject, he begged me to
bring the matter first before the church. On
Wednesday evening of the same week the church
met, and on the committees rising, they reported
that they had had an interview with Miss Winter,
and that she had promised them she would return
and occupy her place. At this juncture of the
proceedings, I rose from my seat and offered my
resignation as clerk, and demanded a letter for
myself and wife to unite with the Pierrepont-street
Baptist church, Brooklyn; remarking, at
the same time, that I would not belong to any

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I will not dwell on this subject, lest I should
weary the patience of my reader; but will return
and relate a few things which occurred while I
was employed by Mr. Withington. It is well
known to most of my readers, that he is an extensive
manufacturer; and it is also a well-known
fact, that his manner of doing business is strictly
honest. He is also noted for his peculiar eccentricities
and extended benevolence. After I had
been with him not quite one year, my third child
was born, on the 11th of August, 1839. I had
a great deal of writing and talking to perform
during my stay, for which I was well paid. On
the 6th of January, 1841, my eldest son (the
fourth child) was born. While with Mr. Withington,
my intellect was taxed to a very great
extent, so that I was enabled to perform an immense
amount of mental as well as physical
labour; and by this means I became very ambitious,
which subjected me at times to derision
from my eccentric employer. He would sometimes

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After having remained with him nearly five
years--comfortable and happy the most of the
time--through some little misunderstanding between
us, the fault being mostly my own, we
concluded to separate. But now, let me inform
my reader, he is about eighty years of age, still
doing a great business, and, should I survive him,
I will ever cherish his memory with respect. I
left him on the 23rd of May, 1843, and entered
into co-partnership with E. Welch, his grandson,
in the same kind of business.


Notwithstanding Mr. Withington gave me at the
rate of $1,000 during a portion of the last year
I was with him, and a good salary previous to
that time, and very frequently a handsome present,

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not being satisfied in doing well, I wanted to
do a little better; I therefore opened a tea store
in Williamsburgh, and in the course of the year I
found it to be an unprofitable concern. I very
wisely, after consulting with Mr. Welch upon the
subject, concluded to shut it up, which I did. I
now devoted my whole attention to the business
of the firm, until January, 1844; when, unfortunately
for me, the subject of animal magnetism
began to be discussed in our village, and the
whole community became magnetic mad. Being
naturally of a very inquiring mind, although a
sceptic in many things, I came to the conclusion
to go and witness Professor Johnson's exploits.
The lectures were delivered in the Bethel Baptist
church, of which I was then a member. Being

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He had, before our arrival, retired to rest; notwithstanding
which, we awoke him. When he
came to the door, he said, addressing himself to
me, “I know what you have come for; you are
skeptical in regard to the truth of animal magnetism;
but I can satisfy you.” Upon this assurance,
he awoke his little daughter, and after I
had fully convinced myself that she was awake,
I told him to proceed.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He then placed her in a chair, and after making
a few passes downwards with his hands, in about
three minutes he pronounced her fully magnetized.
He then made her arm perfectly rigid, so that I
could not bend it without injuring the child.
After the performance of a few other experiments,
I began to think there was something in it; and
for the purpose of testing further the truth of the
so-called science of animal and phreno-magnetism,
I invited the parties to appear at my house on the
following Monday evening. They accordingly
came, in connexion with a number of others
whom I had invited,--about thirty-six persons in
all. Mrs. G-----and her daughter were both
magnetized, by Professors Jacobs and Granville,
and a number of experiments were tried by the
gentlemen upon the subjects, in which they were
successful.


I told the father, before he awoke the child, I
wished to test the truth of the phrenological experiments;
remarking, at the same time, that I
did not believe that phenomena could be produced
in any one that I had witnessed in Professor
Johnson's subject, a few evenings before. After
taking the finger of the magnetiser, and placing
it on the organ of tune, she began to sing, when

During the course of the week, some of my
friends waited on me, and expressed a wish that
I should deliver a public lecture on the subject.
I consented, and made my <i>debut</i> a few evenings
after this request As many of my readers
are familiar with what took place on that evening,
I will not detail the particulars, but will only
say, that the experiments were mostly satisfactory
to some, while others pronounced it a humbug.
From that evening, I was styled “Professor”
by those who knew me, and consequently was at
the beck and call of almost every one throughout
all the region round about Williamsburgh.


I delivered two lectures in Brooklyn, shortly
after this, which brought me still farther into notice.
The public newspapers got to quarrelling

Having now spent nearly two months writing,
lecturing, and experimenting on the subject, I
came to the conclusion to abandon my professional
career, and once more resume my business duties.
And in order to get rid of the excitement under
which I was labouring, I came to the determination
to go south; after informing my partner of
my intentions, I made arrangements with Captain
Williams, of the brig <i>David Duffel</i>, to take me and
my brother Charles, together with some articles
of merchandize with him to Wilmington, N. C.
We sailed, and in a few days arrived at the port
of our destination. Having taken with me various
letters of recommendation to different merchants
in that place, it did not take me long to
become acquainted; and during my stay, I was
hospitably entertained by different individuals,
most of whom were Baptists. By the request of

We passed up the beautiful Potomac, passed
Mount Vernon, where the remains of the Father
of our Country, George Washington, are deposited,
and soon we arrived at the capital city.


I put up at Brown's hotel, and immediately proceeded
to the house of Govenor Van Ness, and
after stating my business, we took a carriage and
repaired immediately to the pension office; after
transacting our business, we set out for the capitol
at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue; on arriving
at this place he conducted me into the Supreme
Court room, where I found the immortal
Story was presiding as judge. After listening for
a short time to his honour, who was then speaking,
I left this place, and proceeded to the Senate chamber,
where they were just going into secret session;
shut out from this, I then proceeded to the
chamber of the House of Representatives, where
I found them in session, and remained there during
the most of the afternoon. I then went into the

The next day I called on a number of merchants
who were in the habit of buying goods of
me, and after finishing all my business in Washington,
I left by the cars for Baltimore, where I
arrived in the dusk of the evening, and put up at
Barnum's Hotel, one of the best in the United
States. On the following morning I called on a
number of my customers, and after finishing my
business with them, I left that afternoon by the
cars for Philadelphia, at which place I arrived in
the night, and on the following morning took a
stroll around for the purpose of viewing the beautiful
quaker city. About eight o'clock I took the
railroad train for New York, at which place I
arrived about two o'clock, and came immediately
over home; on entering the house, my wife immediately
informed me of the action of the church,
which circumstance I have before alluded to. I
was much surprised on going to my store the
next morning, to find my business in a deranged

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004177170-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For a short time things went on very well, but
in the course of two or three months, I became
restless, nervous, and dissatisfied, finally I ceased
to act, and determined to leave the concern; for
three months I was laid up with the blues, after
which we dissolved partnership on the eighth day
of September, 1844. In a few days after this, I
commenced business on my own account, with a
small capital of about $700. My store was located
in Jones Lane, near Front-street; I employed
a young man for a bookkeeper, and took my
brother-in-law in foreman, and had business the
most of the time to keep ten hands employed.
But my career in this place was destined to be
short; I had not been in business more than two
months before the presidential campaign commenced,
when I was carried away by the political
excitement; I had my combativeness aroused at
a Native American mass meeting, where I was
mobed, the particulars of which the most of ray
readers are familiar with, therefore I shall omit to
name them. Now for the first time I entered the

Mr. D. E. M., a particular friend, called on me
one day, and expressed a wish that I should go
West with him. I heartily complied with his
wishes and went, and in about two weeks I returned
a well man. On my return, my old friend
W., and Colonel W., of our village, advised me
to go into the real estate business. I took their
advice, opened a land office, and in about three
months after I commenced, I made about $1,400,
during which time my wife received $600 from
the Government. Fortune smiled for a time.
My friend Berrien, at my request, deeded her
two small lots of land, on which she built a house,
which cost $1,500. She employed her own
money in the erection of this building, which left
her in debt, owing to its having been blown down,
about $1,000.


Just before this accident happened to the house,
I used up my spare money in paying off old
debts, and erecting a stone foundation on two lots
of land, situated on the corner of South Third

Having now arrived to the age of thirty-two,
and as I promised to give my readers thirty-two
years of the life of an adventurer, I will now
inform you that the eccentric genius of whom I
have bean writing is no other than your humble
author,
