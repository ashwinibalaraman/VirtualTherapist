The patient accounts to be related in subsequent chapters
will attempt to illustrate our hypothesis that acute
psychotic experience is a complex construct containing
elements of the past and present which are uniquely felt
and portrayed through the permissive mechanism of an
altered state of consciousness. This mechanism is evoked
initially in some individuals at periods of developmental
impasse. By the term "altered state" we mean a prolonged
period during which the experience of self and
external world are radically altered, when the form and
content of conscious experience undergo a profound de-structuring.
Some aspects of these states will be illustrated
in the detailed patients' accounts to follow. At this
juncture we will focus on particular generic forms which
we have encountered. Although the last word on the
phenomenology of psychotic states has not been heard,
we feel that, descriptively speaking, two major kinds of
experiences can be observed. We do not know whether
these kinds of experiences have prognostic significance
although some research suggests that they may.

"PSYCHEDELIC" EXPERIENCES IN ACUTE PSYCHOTIC STATES


<b>Case 1</b>—A 38-year-old music teacher, pressed by debts
and family problems and concerned with a very real national
crisis, began to feel that life was taking on a new
emotional intensity. He noted a cross on a familiar
church for the first time, and felt that it had profound,
exciting meaning for him. He felt close to nature, empathically
understanding human and subhuman life. A
few nights later he described a sensation that "God actually
touched my heart. The next day was horror and
ecstasy. I began to feel that I might be the agent of some
spiritual reawakening. The emotional intensity of the
experience became overpowering." Gradually, anxiety
and persecutory delusions outstripped the ecstatic
elements and the patient made a serious suicide attempt.
Even much later in psychotherapy he recalled "the experience"
as one of profound meaning for him, one
which he would always cherish.


<b>Case 2</b>—A 21-year old college student, concerned
about his parents and about a love affair, became guilt-ridden
after a sexual experience with his girlfriend. Soon
thereafter, he felt that his life was completely changed.
He felt a sense of mission in the world which he now saw
"as a completely wonderful place" and stated, "I began
to experience goodness and love for the first time." Life
for him took on an intense benevolent quality which he

<b>Case 3</b>—Another 21-year-old college student had been
ruminating for some time about "personality problems"
and difficulties in choosing a vocation. The following is
essentially a verbatim account of the week prior to his
admission.


Before last week, I was quite closed about my
emotions; then finally I owned up to them with another
person. I began to speak without thinking beforehand
and what came out showed an awareness
of human beings and God. I could feel deeply about
other people. We felt connected. The side which
had been suppressing emotions did not seem to be
the real one. I was in a higher and higher state of
exhilaration and awareness. Things people said
had hidden meaning. They said things that applied
to life. Everything that was real seemed to make
sense. I had a great awareness of life, truth, and
God. I went to church and suddenly all parts of the
service made sense. My senses were sharpened. I became
fascinated by the little insignificant things
around me. There was an additional awareness of
the world that would do artists, architects, and
painters good. I ended up being too emotional, but
I felt very much at home with myself, very much at
ease. It gave me a great feeling of power. It was not a
case of seeing more broadly but deeper. I was losing
touch with the outside world and lost my sense of
time. There was a fog around me in some sense, and

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On admission this patient was severely agitated; delusional
and self-referential thoughts were prominent.


<b>Case 4</b>—A 21-year-old student, progressively agitated
by homosexual concerns and fears of nuclear disaster,
walked all night long with a friend. He described his
experience as a "revelation." Sights and sounds possessed
a keenness that he had never experienced before.
He felt an unusual sense of empathy with this friend and
spoke of spontaneous understanding "like that of a little
child." Stars in the sky seemed to have special significance,
and at one point he felt that his friend resembled
Christ. This state proceeded rapidly to an acute catatonic
reaction.


<b>Case 5</b>—A 35-year-old housewife sought psychiatric
assistance because of her uneasiness over an impending
move to another city. In the course of the evaluation she
began to wonder about the "meaning of my whole life."
She reported sensations of "being a spectator while the
procession of life goes by." Over a two-day period her
anxiety mounted as she attempted to deal with her guilt
about a longstanding affair of which her husband had
no knowledge. Rather abruptly she noted "my senses
were sharpened, sounds were more intense and I could
see with greater clarity; everything seemed very clear to

<b>Case 6</b>—A 20-year-old artist, who was subsequently
followed for seven years in psychotherapy, has frequently
referred to his states of altered awareness. Such subjective
feelings occurred during each of two acute psychotic
episodes and throughout psychotherapy. He
describes a mystic or "cryptic state" during which the
solutions to various problems seem obvious. Colors become
impressive to him, they lose their boundaries, and
seem to flow. In these states his sense of communion and
community is enhanced; he feels capable of bringing together
the arts and sciences, his separated parents, and
himself into harmonious "oscillation" with the world.
Going without sleep heightens the mystic states and improves
his "freedom and vision" in painting. In this
state he cannot tell whether he is "thrilled, frightened,
pained, or anxious—they are all the same."


Our experience suggests that the fullblown syndrome
of amphetamine psychosis often develops out of a state
of hyperawareness. One patient, having taken small
doses of amphetamine for only three days in the post-partum
period, began to have the subjective feeling that
God was trying to help her. Colors and normally trivial
observations began to take on ominous significance.
Things that would not usually be noticed seemed to be
"connected." Another patient, chronically sleepless and
taking high doses of amphetamines over several months
phoned and reported he was feeling better, "released,"

<b>Case 7</b>—The final case, a young man who had taken
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) two years prior to
his psychotic episode, presented a unique opportunity to
compare a drug reaction with a psychotic reaction. During
his four months of treatment with one of us, he himself
frequently compared the two experiences, and found
a number of similarities. In his account which follows,
the first part was written down after a few weeks of treatment
when he was considerably calmer, and was reflecting
upon the prior LSD-25 experience. The last part is
taken from his admission interview.


In the half hour for the drug to take effect, the
drugged person has a psychosomatic terror of madness.
He seeks to retain some small part of his former
existence unchanged... he desires to repeat
things for the assurance such repetition gives of a
return to normality. The tendency to repeat is compulsive
and persistent. There is yet another resistance
and that is verbosity. The drugged person,
like the insane, feels that weeding out what was previously
wrong—an attempt to perfect an earlier
feeling—is necessary. There is a paranoid fear of
certain places... the feeling is that such places are

While I was at Grace Hospital it was my sense of
hearing which was the most disturbed. Soon after I
was placed in my room at home all of my senses
became perverted ... The tricks played upon me by
my perverted senses of taste, touch, smell, and sight
were the source of great mental anguish. None of
my food had its usual flavor. This soon led to that
common delusion that some of it contained poison
... At breakfast I had cantaloupe, liberally sprinkled
with salt. The salt seemed to pucker my
mouth, and I believed it to be powdered alum. Usually,
with my supper, sliced peaches were served.
Though there was sugar on the peaches, salt would
have done as well. Salt, sugar, and powdered alum
had become the same to me.


Familiar materials had acquired a different
"feel." In the dark, the bed sheets at times seemed
like silk... What that purpose was I could not divine,
and my very inability to arrive at a satisfactory
conclusion stimulated my brain to the assembling
of disturbing thoughts in an almost endless train.
Thus does a perverted sense grow by what it feeds
on...


My sense of sight was subjected to many weird
and uncanny effects. Phantasmagoric visions made
their visitations throughout the night ... Moving
pictures, often brilliantly colored, were thrown on
the ceiling of my room and sometimes on the sheets
of my bed ... I remember one vision of vivid beauty.
Swarms of butterflies and large and gorgeous moths
appeared on the sheets. That sight I really enjoyed,
knowing that the pretty creatures were not alive;
and I wished that the usually unkind operator
would continue to minister to my aesthetic taste by
feeding it on colors so rich and so faultlessly
combined.

In brief, it seems that these patients are describing a
state, which occurred early in their illness, in which they
recognize an altered way of experiencing themselves,
others, and the world. They report having stepped beyond
the restrictions of their usual state of awareness.
Perceptual modes seem heightened and changed; the
emotional response evoked is singularly intense. Such
experiences are frequently felt to be a kind of breakthrough,
characterized by words and phrases such as "release"
or "new creativity." Individuals experience feelings
of getting to the essence of things—of the external
world, of others, and of themselves. On the other hand,
there is usually a vague, disquieting, progressive sense of
dread, which may eventually dominate the entire experience.
In some accounts, the experience of perceptual
alteration seems to be dominant; others emphasize the
intense affectivity, and still others the inner experience
of revelation or creative clarification. The term "psychedelic"
(mind manifesting) has been applied to some
aspects of these experiences with some justification. For
whatever the ultimate meaning and assimilation of such
manifest subjective data, the experience is intrinsically
one of increased sensory pace and content. As we have
seen, the notion that some dormant aspects of mental life
are being awakened is overdetermined in these experiences.

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is important to consider the primary changes in perceptual
experiences as distinct from their inclusion in
one or another delusional idea. The statement by Dr.
Weber, Schreber's physician, is a particularly astute observation
of the sequential steps in the formation of delusions.
Weber insists that Schreber first experienced
"disturbances of common sensation," and the quotation
from Clifford Beers is an illustrative example of the same
phenomenon. With regard to the special senses, we have
been able to observe at least three modes of sensory disturbance.
These may be illustrated in part, by the sensory
experiences recounted by the following patient. She is a
35-year-old woman with a recurrent psychotic disorder,
who has been followed by me for several years. At the
beginning of one recent partial relapse she noted the following
olfactory phenomena:


During the time I was getting sick again, I
began to think about the abortions I had before
I was married. I was feeling guilty about them
again. In those days you always tried to abort
yourself first by taking quinine. When I was
taking a shower and thinking about the past, I
suddenly noticed the unmistakable smell of
quinine. Soon after that, my mother and I were

Thus, in addition to hyperesthesia, there are other
kinds of distortion of special sensory experiences in early
psychosis. Sensation may be uniquely tied to dynamically
significant material, as in the account cited above.
Sensory changes in one modality may also be triggered
by input from another modality. In the case above, hearing
the word <i>oranges</i> led to the olfactory experience of
oranges.


FRAGMENTED SELF-EXPERIENCES IN
ACUTE PSYCHOTIC STATES


In the second type of experience we have seen in psychosis,
the experiential self and its sense of ownership
and agency may be altered, invaded, divided, or diminished.
Whereas the psychedelic experience confronts the
experiential self with increased sensory pace and content,
in the fragmented self-experience there is a loss of
cohesiveness and unity, both in the actual sense of self
(identity feeling) and in those cognitive experiences normally
"felt" to be one's own and under one's own
control.


<b>Case 1</b>—A 20-year-old man was admitted because of
profound withdrawal and blocking speech behavior
which had been progressive for at least a year. During
interviews he would begin to answer questions, but
would hesitate painfully, often in the middle of a sentence.
Months later he described this inability to finish
sentences as due to lapses in his thinking, periods during
social interaction when his mind would go blank, as if
his thoughts had been "stolen or removed."

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Case 2</b>—A 19-year-old man developed acute psychotic
symptoms characterized by the notion that he could read
the minds of others, or, more precisely, that the thoughts
of others simply became his thoughts. He would state
that when he noted a particular feeling or expression in
someone else, he suddenly realized that "this was my
thought too."


<b>Case 3</b>—An 18-year-old girl was admitted in an acute
psychotic condition. She was extremely uncommunicative
but was suffering visibly from inner turmoil. When
she was finally able to describe her state of mind, she said
that she felt a part of her had died, that she had "lost the
feeling of myself, I am no longer me."


<b>Case 4</b>—A 21-year-old woman-developed an acute psychotic
reaction in which she felt she was "visited" in her
mind by a group of three individuals who told her what
to think. When these individuals would decide what
thought she should have, then she would experience that
very thought.


<b>Case 5</b>—A 20-year-old man developed a prolonged
psychotic reaction following an LSD experience. During
the acute drug experience, he felt that other people in the
room could monitor his thoughts and would react
knowingly to them by making certain confirmatory gestures.
This state of mind persisted for several months.


<b>Case 6</b>—A 20-year-old woman became acutely psychotic
a few weeks after leaving home for the first time to
attend college. She, at first, had the notion that a few
other people were talking about her. Later she developed
the notion that essentially she no longer had any intrapsychic
privacy. That is, she felt that her every thought

Some investigators feel that these phenomena, characterized
by loss of a sense of ownership of thoughts and
bodily feeling and by severe alteration in identity feeling,
are characteristic of true schizophrenia, in contrast to the
schizophreniform states which seem to have a better
prognosis. Even at the descriptive level, these experiences
represent a more basic alteration in core personality
or ego function than the psychedelic type described
previously. However, whether this difference has its
foundation in the ego organization of the individual or
in the psychobiology of the altered state is unknown.


CONTINUITY BETWEEN ACUTE PSYCHOTIC STATES
AND OTHER ALTERED STATES


When seen from the point of view of subjective experience
some experiencing in the early stages of psychosis
becomes less discontinuous with other altered
modes of experiencing. For instance, LSD-25 and mescaline
may induce a very comparable perceptual and affective
condition. The drug state is clearly a multipotential
state with many factors influencing the final outcome; an
outcome which can range from excruciating anxiety and

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Psychotomimetic drugs such as d-lysergic
acid diethylamide ... reliably and consistently
produce periods of altered perception and experience
without clouded consciousness or
marked physiological changes; mental processes
that are usually dormant and transient
during wakefulness become "locked" into a
persistent state. The usual boundaries which
structure thought and perception become fluid;
awareness becomes vivid while control over
input is markedly diminished; customary inputs
and modes of thought and perception become
novel, illusory, and portentous; and with
the loss of customary controlling anchors, dependence
on the surroundings, on prior expectations,
or on a mystique for structure and support
is enhanced. Psychiatrists recognize these
primary changes as a background state out of
which a number of secondary psychological

There are other intense self-experiences which have
elements in common with the accounts we have presented.
William James's classic study of religious phenomena,
for instance, is replete with accounts of conversion
experiences that are strikingly similar to the cases
we have described, and to the experiences of some subjects
under LSD-25 and mescaline.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_33931');">[note]</a><div id="_note_33931" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9. James, W. <i>The varieties of religious experience</i>.
New York: The New American Library of World
Literature, Inc., 1958.</div>
James describes the
characteristics of the affective experience in religious
conversion as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>
The central one is the loss of all worry, the
sense that all is ultimately well with one, the
peace, the harmony, the willingness to be, even
though the outer conditions should remain the
same ... The second feature is the sense of perceiving
truths not known before. The mysteries
of life become lucid ... and often the
solution is more or less unutterable in words
... A third peculiarity of the assurance state is
the objective change which the world often appears
to undergo ... The most characteristic of
all the elements of the conversion crisis ... is
the ecstasy of happiness produced.

James himself seems to have been well aware of the
similarity between the conversion experience and certain
psychotic reactions.

But more remains to be told, for religious mysticism
is only one half of mysticism. The other
half has no accumulated traditions, except
those which the textbooks on insanity supply.
Open any one of these, and you will find abundant
cases in which "mystical ideas" are cited
as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or deluded
states of mind. In delusional insanity ...
we may have a diabolical mysticism, a sort of
religious mysticism turned upside down. The
same sense of ineffable importance in the
smallest events, the same texts and words coming
with new meanings, the same voices and
visions and leadings and missions, the same
controlling by extraneous powers; only this
time the emotion is pessimistic: instead of consolations
we have desolations; the meanings
are dreadful; and the powers are enemies to
life. It is evident that from the point of view of
their psychological mechanism, the classic
mysticism and these lower mysticisms spring
from the same mental level, from the great subliminal
or transmarginal region of which science
is beginning to admit the existence, but of
which so little is really known. That region
contains every kind of matter: "seraph and
snake" abide there side by side. To come from
thence is no infallible credential. What comes
must be sifted and tested, and run the gauntlet
of confrontation with the total context of experience,
just like what comes from the outer
world of sense.

With the advent of psychotomimetic drugs there was
renewed interest in the study of altered mental states, but
the opportunity to catch <i>in situ</i> the formation and genesis
of a variety of symptoms and modes of behaving and
coping has not been extensively exploited. In part, it was
doubted that drug-induced experiences were sufficiently
related to clinically encountered dysfunctions to be of interest.

Yet, it is hardly surprising that temporary and
experimentally induced states do not reproduce all the
features characterizing clinical processes; the latter are
neither bound as rigorously by time nor circumscribed
by the highly socialized safeguards of the conventional
laboratory situation. Rather, these differences only high-light
those features of clinical disorders which require
explanation in terms of developmental factors and restitutive
and compensatory sequences. The patient experiencing
and functioning in this altered state must cope
over time with a variety of life tasks, family and social
interactions; his resilience and overall disposition to represent,
identify, and differentiate "inside and outside"
and to relate in a reality-oriented way, will distinguish
him from most experimental subjects.

Similarly, the fact that these drugs produce ecstatic
states from which new learning, a shift in values, or subsequent
behavior change purportedly ensue, was
thought to isolate such states from their "psychotomimetic
status," and perhaps to elevate them to a higher
level of discourse. Some enthusiasts even appear to argue
that this novelty is beyond psychological description and
investigation. Yet the variety of contexts in which such
mystic states occur includes psychotic illnesses, as our
data have reemphasized. It is also evident that this range
of similar states differs not only in outcome, but in the
extent to which a variety of ego functions are operative
—functions such as memory, self-reflective capacity,
tolerance for ambiguity, selective attention, the ability to
implement wishes and needs in reality, the ability to synthesize,
to order, and to serially locate, and to integrate
ongoing experiences with past and future. These differentiating
features tend to be lost if all such states are described
only in terms of loosened ego boundaries, regression
in the service of the ego, altered ego autonomy, and
deautomatization.

Such descriptions should properly
apply only to certain aspects and attributes of certain
of the ego operations altered during these conditions.
During various phases of the clinical course of a psychosis,
one frequently sees fluid states in which elements
of perceptual instability and psychedelic experience
occur, preceded or followed by more settled postures
in which the patient, through either recognition, insight,
withdrawal, or delusion and symptom formation,
tends to experience and cope in quite different ways.
Similarly, in drug-induced psychedelic states, as the
acute and vivid effects subside, one can observe a variety
of paranoid and defensive measures, mild ideas of reference,
mood change, and inappropriate or highly imaginative
interpretations of the ongoing or previous experience.

Descriptively, these states of heightened awareness but
diminished control over input are frequently characterized
by delusional mastery (either shared or idiosyncratic)
or (as with dreams) by hallucinatory mastery of
the ongoing experience with concomitant euphoria.
One is reminded of Freud's "model psychosis." "A
dream, then, is a psychosis," he remarked, beginning a
chapter in the <i>Outline of Psychoanalysis</i>.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_43542');">[note]</a><div id="_note_43542" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">19. Freud, S. <i>An outline of psychoanalysis</i>. New York:
W. W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc. 1949.</div>
The absurdities,
lapses, hallucinatory mastery, and mental processes
of psychoses are evident in dreams, Freud argued. Some
of the differences between dream and psychosis cited by
him were the short duration of the dream, its useful or
adaptive function, and the fact that it is to some degree
under the control of the dreamer. In the case of drug-induced
states, the onset and duration of changes (and to
a great extent the intensity of effects) are dependent on
dosage. On the other hand, as Freud noted, "the dream is
brought about with the subject's consent and is ended by
an act of his will." However, this might be translated
into the language of ego psychology: the dream as an
episode in a sequence of states is implied as is a normal,
overall capacity to integrate this episode into the total
fabric of living. Such autonomy or integrative control
probably is present in widely varying degrees in the
states we have reviewed.

These states frequently appear almost to compel rationalization
or interpretation as, on occasion, do
dreams or any number of traumatic, infantile, or hypnoid
states
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_44934');">[note]</a><div id="_note_44934" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">20. Loewald, H. Hypnoid states — repression, abreaction,

in which the ongoing intense experiences
have yet to "run the gauntlet of confrontation" with total
experience. That this is not easy, and that delusional
outcomes, conversion, or startling change in behavioral
patterns can occur, is apparent. These outcomes occur
with varying degrees of dependence upon persons,
groups, or authority. Thus, this kind of experience is
highly narcissistic (in that it is referred to the self), but
descriptively, certain aspects of relatedness to objects remain,
and even attain a heightened personal significance;
further, such relatedness assumes a heightened
importance in regulating ego functions. In the drug experience,
subjects characteristically depend on the therapist
or "guide" not simply as an object, but for elemental
ego support—to diminish anxiety and to structure the
experience or to sanction participation in it. Patients in
acute psychotic states have similar needs for ego support.
From scrutiny of clinical and drug-induced states one
might propose that there is a rearrangement of a number
of ego functions (of which changes in the control of sensory
data, attention, perception, and stability of mental
self-representation are quite striking); these may lead
subsequently or concomitantly to a narcissistically enhanced
sense of the self or to a markedly distorted sense
of the self and the world. The experimental production
of experiences of altered awareness can help both to differentiate
and reveal the relatedness of many complex
phenomena encountered in clinical psychiatry, with
their intricate layering of social, motivational, compensatory,
and regressive features. The wide range of contexts
in which states of altered awareness are found to

There are a number of drugs which apparently can
initiate or trigger a psychotic altered state of consciousness
in a predisposed individual. These compounds include
the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant
compounds, lysergic acid diethylamide and
related indolealkylamines, amphetamine and related
compounds, and possibly 1-dihydroxyphenylalanine.
(Several patient accounts illustrating psychotic states related
to drug use will be presented.) The essential point
to be made here is that, if the altered state is dissected out
as an ingredient in psychosis, it becomes a concept
which can be related to the biology of altered states of
consciousness. Thus, one possible model of the "organ
vulnerability" in psychosis becomes apparent.
