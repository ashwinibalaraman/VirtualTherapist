BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So what I like to do is to review from the last session usually. You told me that you were not crazy about your job.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You have a boss that gets irritated very easily.
<b>PT:</b> I’ve had three bosses that, everybody in the place, I’m not going back there. I actually got hurt there, I got a concussion. My arm was in a splint for weeks and I’m just not going back.
<b>DR:</b> When was your last day?
<b>PT:</b> The last day, I got hurt on Wednesday two weeks ago, I forget the date.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But…
<b>DR:</b> So have you been off of work since the injury?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. Well I went back a couple of days. They sent me home one day because I was just out of it. You know, I was dazed from the concussion. Like the next day after, I went to the hospital, it happened at work and I don’t remember how it happened, I just remember getting up and feeling really sick and then I got into the car, I was moving cars around, that’s what I do at the end of the day, it happened at the end of the day and I was missing a whole bunch of keys and then we were looking for the keys around in the cars, you know, then I found my car key which was inside of my pocket, that was on the ground along with like three other keys, my cell phone was on the ground, so I obviously fell over there and then my boss noticed my eye was puffy and the whole thing was all black and it looked like somebody punched me and it was all black and white and my wrists got [INAUDIBLE], you know.
<b>DR:</b> So you have no idea how it happened at all?
<b>PT:</b> No, so. Then I went to the hospital and got CT scanned and whatever x-rays and everything, then I went to a neurologist because my headaches and migraines were increasing.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> But I think that was stress from the job because I haven’t had one since. 
<b>DR:</b> So maybe I’m blocking this time so you don’t have to go back to that job.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You’re not planning to go back.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.I’ve got to go to school. I can’t, you know, I’m [AGE] and my whole 20’s I actually wasted but I just want to, you know, do something that at least I’m proud of or at least hoping, you know, something that I feel good about, not just a job that’s, you know, I mean I need a job to pay the bills, whatever, do that in the meantime but just I’m going to check out a school. I already filled out last Fall for [DEIDENTIFIED] in [DEIDENTIFIED] and I was going to go there but it’s like a technical school, so I’m not sure that’s what I want to do.
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember before you kind of got of track in life, you know, with everything else in your 20’s…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you remember ever having something that you wanted to do?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my whole life I’ve always just been a musician and that’s…
<b>DR:</b> What kind of music?
<b>PT:</b> Jazz, I was getting into jazz.
<b>DR:</b> That you played or you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, what did you play?
<b>PT:</b> Bass.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, nice. So you’d like to do something if you could with that?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah I would but then I stopped playing during that time so I started playing again afterwards but not as much and bands, all the people I used to play with, you know, I don’t talk to them you know. I could put an ad in the weekly or something and find a bass player looking or there’s usually ads in there but it’s…
<b>DR:</b> You need to actually be in a band. That’s a tough life.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. It’d be tough because then, whatever, you just have to have a day job unless you’re really good and, you know, you get a deal with a record company.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I means for a band or you could become a studio musician but you have to be extremely good and put 8 hours a day into practice, you know, it’s still a full time job just to get there, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you’d be…?
<b>PT:</b> It’s like acting, you know, it’s like hard…
<b>DR:</b> Very hard, very easy to kind of go to the poverty level and very hard to make it big.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I’m good. If I didn’t waste all that time and if I practiced all the time, I could be by now but, you know…
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you are good 
<b>PT:</b> I also want to do glass blowing.
<b>DR:</b> Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b> So, but there’s only, there’s one course that they finally have in [DEIDENTIFIED] from [DEIDENTIFIED] school of art. It’s just a weekend course but it used to only be at [DEIDENTIFIED] but they brought it into [DEIDENTIFIED] now. Actually, I think there’s more than one course. I think they have glass blowing one, then glass blowing two, then they have a lot of other glass, glass fusion, glass whatever, so I was going to take those courses too.
<b>DR:</b> Does [DEIDENTIFIED] do it?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, that’s [DEIDENTIFIED] school of art.
<b>DR:</b> Where’s that?
<b>PT:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] but glass blowing isn’t there. I think that’s [DEIDENTIFIED]
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> Which is right by [DEIDENTIFIED] I think.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Or actually, I think [DEIDENTIFIED] school is in [DEIDENTIFIED] or something.
<b>DR:</b> Is it expensive to go there? Is it something you’d be able to do maybe?
<b>PT:</b> Well it’s only, it’s only like two days for the course. It’s like $400. If you become a member, it’s cheaper, you just have to pay for materials and whatnot. You know what I mean, none of the classes are really expensive or very long, you know, but yeah it’s something I’d like to do. That would be hard to make a living. I mean I’m a good artist, I’m good at making stuff and like, you know, hand forging and…
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, hand, anything hand made like glass blowing, whatever is very expensive, like bed frames, or coffee tables, lamps, whatnot, you know, but again it’s a hard thing to do. With this auction, you know, you can put it on the Internet but if you want to open a store, I mean I could take a business class, I wanted to do that too but I feel that I have to stay sensitive
<b>DR:</b> Right, it’s important [INAUDIBLE], your at crossroad
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I might go to [DEIDENTIFIED] or [DEIDENTIFIED] for like auto mechanics because it’s something I can do and it’s for mainly motorcycle repair. It’s something I can do and something I’ve done and then I can get a job at a dealership and at least make decent money and have insurance and then I could go to, because those schools, those classes are on like the weekends or at night, so I’d be out of work by then and [DEIDENTIFIED] is only a year school and then I think you have to work another year and you can get certified, actually certified.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> You can actually make more money, so then I could try to start a glass blowing business while I’m doing that.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like at least you’ve got plans for the future.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, while I’m going to [DEIDENTIFIED] I’m just going to get a part time job, you know, just to pay the bills, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Do you find being out of work, you said your headaches are a lot, do you find that anxiety in general so much? 
<b>PT:</b> Um, it was at first but now I’m worried about money and what I’m going to do. I mean I have plans of what I want to do but I’m just going through the things, it’s just hard, you know, it’s hard to get going.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.,
<b>PT:</b> You know what I mean, it’s just nervous and I got arrested the other day.
<b>DR:</b> For what?
<b>PT:</b> Some guy was assaulting me and I’ve had trouble with this guy before at my street and the first time I had trouble with him, I drove by and he punched the roof of my car and he tried to start a fight with me. When we were at the police station, the police told me, the officer said that he’s a troublemaker, he just got out of jail for assault. On Sunday I fixed my brakes so I had some tools in my car, a knife for cutting the, to put on the brake lines to bleed it, you know, like you cut a hose so you can reuse the brake fluid and I had a little wrench and when I drove by I heard a boom and I didn’t see him and I stopped the car and I got out and looked and there was a wash mitt for washing a car and I looked up and I saw him look at me, I said what’s your problem? He came running at me, just nuts and drool and everything, I mean I was scared out of my mind. I was like holy shit, you know. I didn’t even know what to do. He started to just check, I mean he didn’t hit me but he was hitting me with his shoulder and leg, like a football player would block.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And he kept pushing me into the car and he wouldn’t. He said what are you going to do? I said I’m going to call the cops, you know, I’m going to get you arrested and he wouldn’t let me get into my car and I didn’t have my cell phone anyway and I couldn’t get in my car. The only thing I saw was the knife so I grabbed it and just because I didn’t want to fight him, my hand was in a splint. I couldn’t do anything, I was just scared and I just grabbed the knife, he saw it and he walked away and that’s what I was hoping, it was a just a scandal, ending up stabbing me, know what I mean. I just wanted to scare him. I was like get in your car, go away, call the police. So my street’s a one-way street, so I drive around the whole big block, park my car, I saw that he had already called the police because I said I was going to and he made up a story that his wife, they just said that I saw him stop, slammed on my brakes, put it in reverse, got out of the car with the knife and just chased him. That’s what they said. They wouldn’t arrest him and so I had to go to court. I was scared out of my mind, you know. I mean I’ve never had, I never, they could go back to the nursery school, elementary school, middle school, high school, I have no fights.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> No assaults, I have no police records whatsoever, none, you know. I didn’t want to fight the guy. I was just trying to get out of fighting with every way possible. I was scared. The guy was literally like, he looked like he was crazed, like I mean he was drooling, he had snots dripping out of his mouth, he was drooling spit and everything, you know.
<b>DR:</b> So did you get a lawyer? Are you getting a lawyer?
<b>PT:</b> The police said I wouldn’t need one. You know, I just sat in like the lock up for like a half hour, 20 minutes, maybe like that, well it felt like a long time. It was probably maybe 15 or 20 minutes but my father came and they just said promise, I mean they didn’t even handcuff me and they didn’t read me my rights which I think they’re supposed to and they did not. You know they didn’t handcuff me so I had the thing on. He said you’re not going to give us any trouble, I said no, I am a. They checked my things, my license to see if I had any, you know…
<b>DR:</b> Outstanding…
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, warrants, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Did your father believe you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I mean he knows I don’t start fights. I never start fights, you know, I mean there’s certainly a lot of people I want to hit, but I don’t do it because I don’t want to get in trouble and I don’t want to start fights, I knew I wanted to look for another job, that’s the last thing I need on my record is an assault charge.
<b>DR:</b> So if you have a court date, they told you that you don’t need a lawyer?
<b>PT:</b> Well he said that I’m going to have to talk to the prosecutor and if he said if they want to go further with it because it’s my first assault. I asked him, so am I going to go to jail for this, he said no it’s your first offense. I mean I did hold a knife up to him but I didn’t threaten him, I didn’t say I was going to stab him, I just grabbed it, and he saw it and he walked away. 
<b>DR:</b> Where was the knife? 
<b>PT:</b> It was in my center console because I was trying to get into my car. My thought maybe my cell phone was there, it wasn’t, it was at home the whole time or I would have called the police right then and there. He wouldn’t let me get in my car because he knew that’s what I was trying to get or I was trying to get away from him. He was trying to get me to hit him. He was trying as hard as, it’s the only thing I saw, it’s the only thing I could think of to get this guy away from me was try and hopefully he’d be scared and walk away. And that’s all I did. I grabbed it. He saw that I had it in my hand and then he ran away. You know, I didn’t say I’m going to stab you. I didn’t say anything like that.
<b>DR:</b> So how did you feel afterwards, were you really shook up?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I was scared. I was really scared. That’s why I did it. I mean that’s why I grabbed it. I mean I thought the guy was going to, he hit me at least six times, I mean, he didn’t punch me in the face but he was hitting me, wouldn’t let me get into my car and, you know, and you know, he was screaming. I mean, I was touching nose, I couldn’t even get away from the guy, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Couldn’t get away. He wouldn’t let me get away. If I went that way, he would check like that. If I went that way, he would check me like that and I just was able to stick my hand in the car, I just grabbed what I could. If it was a pencil, I would have grabbed that you know.
<b>DR:</b> Did you have any like nightmares or any anxiety afterwards?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I can’t stop thinking about it.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> The guy’s moving, thank God. There’s a for sale sign in front of his house. He’s just a troublemaker. I mean everybody on the block knows him as a troublemaker. And I have a dent in my car from where he hit it, you know, and they wouldn’t arrest him. I wanted him arrested for assault charges and they said when I go to court and talk to the prosecutor, it’s up the judge if they want to pursue it but he has an assault record, he’s been to jail for assault. I’ve had trouble with him before. I have no record. I don’t want to fight.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don’t understand.
<b>DR:</b> So you [INAUDIBLE] your mind off of it, has it affected you at all? Has it interfered with your sleep or caused any more stress or anxiety or?
<b>PT:</b> Definitely anxiety. I’m just scared.
<b>DR:</b> Do you see him around?
<b>PT:</b> No. I think he might have, I haven’t even seen his cars outside at all. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay. The last time when I saw you, you also mentioned that you were feeling more depressed and more anxiety. How would you say that’s been?
<b>PT:</b> The depression, I think that’s because of the job, well I’m kind of depressed about this whole [INAUDIBLE] thing, definitely. I’m just anxious for it to be over with, whatever they’re going to do with me, if I have to pay a fine, if I have to, I don’t know, go on probation, whatever. I mean even though the cop said I’m not going to go to prison, I just still think that’s what’s going to happen.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it’s scary.
<b>PT:</b> And if this guy has his wife, they both said the same story, and he had some, there was only two people outside, they said he had two witnesses, there was only him and either his wife or his girlfriend, whoever it was, there was nobody else. And she couldn’t have seen the knife because I didn’t raise it, it was by my side. 
<b>DR:</b> Well if it’s his wife, I’m sure they must know there’s some bias there.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, that’s what I don’t understand and it’s somebody else that lives with him. It’s not a neutral party. I mean I could throw the knife in the woods and lie about the whole thing, you know, but when the cop came up, I handed him the knife, I explained to him the whole story and I was being completely 100% honest.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know and you know that’s me not him.
<b>DR:</b> Right.How’s your sleep been?
<b>PT:</b> It’s been broken.
<b>DR:</b> Trouble falling asleep? Staying asleep?
<b>PT:</b> I can fall asleep, just staying asleep, I wake up maybe every hour, every so hour, I always look at the clock on my cell phone. It’s definitely been broken.
<b>DR:</b> Any mood swings at all?
<b>PT:</b> No, I’ve been better definitely with that.
<b>DR:</b> Well…
<b>PT:</b> I was bad towards the end before I got hurt. I was going there, I was feeling just absolutely sick every day, physically sick, scared, anxiety was just complete. I mean I had palpitations, I thought I was going to die then. I just couldn’t work there.
<b>DR:</b> Because of the way they treated you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. They gave me a warning for when I had the concussion. I was throwing up for 42 hours and I couldn’t talk really so after I threw up I would call and leave a message. That was the only time I could really open my mouth to talk because any other time I’d just throw up and so I left a message, I got a written warning because I just talked to the managers. They’re just, they’re unfair. They promised me a raise after two months. I worked there for five months and I make less than when I first started work there.
<b>DR:</b> How’s that?
<b>PT:</b> Because I got into an accident, they charged, did I tell you about that?
<b>DR:</b> Yes you did.
<b>PT:</b> The secretary’s $85,000 car into a flower pot that every single sale person hit. Everybody’s hit this thing, you know, and they make the person who makes the least amount of money pay $2000 for it.
<b>DR:</b> Too bad.
<b>PT:</b> That’s ridiculous.
<b>DR:</b> So, you told them you’re not coming back or you’re just not going back?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they know that I’m not coming back. I dropped off my [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Did you feel relief after you let them know that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, yeah, definitely. I felt like a huge weight got lifted.
<b>DR:</b> Whatever anxiety there is from no money is left in the anxiety of going to work there.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because I know I could get a part time job, you know, I filled out a lot of applications at different places. All I need is enough to pay for the bill, you know, I come here every you know, two months, have enough money for that, you know, and for gas whatever I need [INAUDIBLE] you know
<b>DR:</b> Right. So let’s go through the medication a little bit. Did you get the labs?
<b>PT:</b> What labs? I’ve had to have so many tests done.
<b>DR:</b> Too bad. You know, I don’t know if you can find out maybe they did a Depakote level, but if, I think I’m going to give it to you again unless you know where it is. Do you know where the slip is by any chance?
<b>PT:</b> Uh…
<b>DR:</b> I’ll give you another one. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> If you have to think about it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I forgot to get that back 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, try and get it because, so are you taking two or three of the Depakote?
<b>PT:</b> Um, two. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, no, no, three.
<b>DR:</b> You’re taking three?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. Yeah because I have ninety.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah I wrote it for ninety, but I wrote two to three and I think it was going to depend on what the lab showed, but you’re definitely taking three?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so we’ll…
<b>PT:</b> I was taking two and I just started on three.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. So yeah, definitely get the labs. We want to be sure it’s not too high or too low.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But you know, then when I get the results, if there’s anything abnormal I can give you a call. 
<b>PT:</b> Would it show up as anything else…?
<b>DR:</b> Only if they specifically requested a Depakote level, so they probably didn’t.
<b>PT:</b> Okay. And I told my doctor I was on Depakote…
<b>DR:</b> Well what you can do is maybe give your doctor’s office a call and say, I can give you our fax number and they can just fax the results here or you can ask him, did you do a Depakote level because if it is not, you still have to get it because that’s one thing that, I mean. You know, you’re covered how with insurance?
<b>PT:</b> Healthnet.
<b>DR:</b> Through Healthnet. 
<b>PT:</b> That’s going to run out soon.
<b>DR:</b> So get the labs.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Don’t even bother with anything else. Okay, so. All right so, valproic acid level, we’re going to get liver function tests, blood count, now some of these you may have gotten but you know, I just want to make sure that we have them so I’d rather you just go get them because once that insurance runs out, it’s going to be much more difficult until you get another job.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I was going to go to [DEIDENTIFIED] , well, no I need a job
<b>DR:</b> All right, and then you’ve got the Wellbutrin which is the antidepressant and how do you feel that’s helping?
<b>PT:</b> It’s doing it’s job. I’m still a little depressed but I don’t think there’s any sure thing to completely take it away.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, it’s hard when there’s a lot of stresses going on like, now you’re going for a job, you were assaulted, you’ve got a court case coming up, it’s a little bit harder with stress but…
<b>PT:</b> Before this happened, I was definitely feeling a lot better. I was definitely feeling better. 
<b>DR:</b> If you were to rate your mood, 0 to 10, 10 being a normal good mood, the way you think you should feel, if you were to rate that before all this happened, what would you say you were?
<b>PT:</b> When I stopped, before I got arrested?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I’d probably say I was a 7.
<b>DR:</b> 7.
<b>PT:</b> I woke up that morning, it felt like 10 and then that happened, it went straight down to 0.
<b>DR:</b> That’s pretty, it’s really traumatic and scary. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What about currently, what do you give yourself? 
<b>PT:</b> Right now I’m a 4.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really? So, that’s really low.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, 4 or 5.
<b>DR:</b> When’s the court date?
<b>PT:</b> Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b> Well, why don’t we do this? Why don’t we just kind of leave things as they are and sort of assess. I mean if they just dismiss it, that’s going to probably be a huge relief right there. I don’t know if they’d do something like that so quickly but let’s kind of reassess it maybe again in three or four weeks. 
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right and I’m just going to give you those labs and we’ll get a PT, PTT too. Okay, this is for the labs. And you actually still have, you should still have a refill of one more month. I think I’ll just see you in a month because of all the stuff that’s happening. It’s three or four weeks instead of two months like it was last time. Okay, and you still, drug screen, are you still doing the Methadone?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so you’re going to get the labs. All right.
