<font size="4"><b>Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Keaton</b></font>

Lenny Bruce and Buster Keaton had more impact on me than any
other performing artists ever. Their work shaped my insatiable desire
to carve out an identity of my own as a comedian. Through a twist of
fate, both Lenny's mom and Buster's wife became my friends, late in
their lives, and offered a sweet and memorable historic connection
to both my profession and my zeal for comedy that still seems
dreamlike.

Lenny and Buster both died in the sixties. Having seen Lenny
perform live or hanging with an aging Keaton is something I can
only fantasize about. At the time of their deaths I was just starting
college and I was far from getting addicted on the art of stand-up.
Rather, it was a time of real innocence for me, a time of searching for
reasons to live my life in a meaningful and passionate way.


I first came upon Lenny Bruce when a close friend at Ohio State
came into my cell-like apartment in Columbus holding an album,
which was <i>Lenny, "Live" at Berkeley</i>. As I listened I just couldn't
believe that I hadn't known more about this comedic prophet by
then. Oh sure, I had read bits and pieces about his controversial legal
battles but that was mostly it. When I heard this groundbreaking,
gifted comedian wail, I was more than just blown away; I was
speechless. I couldn't utter a word because upon hearing all Lenny
had to say (and just on this one recording!) and the way he rapped,
I just couldn't come close to articulating my fervor at discovering
someone who sounded as if not only he spoke for me but was like a
member of the family or a close friend I never had who could have
the balls to express what he did. From that moment on, Lenny
became the major stimulation to my still hidden, yet budding,
comedic aspirations. Ironically, this stand-up comedian, who I
would forevermore hold up as the bar of artistry and genius in the
world I would enter years later, had already overdosed in Los Angeles.
I was forced then to make this drug casualty my mentor without
him ever knowing it. I was shocked to learn that he was dead but the
stirring damage to me was very much alive. I became hooked on his
legacy.


I was only about nineteen or so but I got it. Man, did I get this guy!
He struck every nerve in my body. His language and style, spoken
almost in jazzlike riffs, at once became my favorite musical. It was bold
and truthful and hip and fearless and brilliant and provocative and
unlike anything I had ever thought comedy could be. He instantly
became an icon and I knew without a doubt that I had found my Hendrix
of comedy. Almost thirty years later I would get a chance to not
only spend time with Lenny's mom but do what I could (along with so

Buster came into my life as I was on my last leg of a ten-week
trek in Europe, a quarter shy of graduating from college. I wound up
in London exhausted, and almost thirty pounds lighter than when I
left, from schlepping around an insanely oversized, inappropriate
suitcase from one train station to another, one shit hotel to the next,
and walking what had to be hundreds of miles as I gobbled up every
art museum and cultural highlight I could on my ten-dollar-a-day
budget. I managed to find a room to live in in each city large enough
to keep my suitcase hidden from all the European snickers while I
did my sightseeing and brain-growing.


By the time I got to London I had about two weeks left of my
vacation. It was the summer of the Manson killings, which left me in
a scary, fragile state of mind that even the Beatles' new music
couldn't rid me of. After about ten countries I was homesick, but still
thankful that these new things called "ruptured hemorrhoids," that I
probably got from schlepping that stupid suitcase around, didn't put
a quick end to my travels early on, and thankful for a German doctor
with a wooden leg and a magic pill! What a trio—van Gogh,
Monet, and a mystical stool softener that enabled me to continue my
journey without Edvard Munch-like screams every time I took a
shit. Ironically enough, I guess I am forced to forevermore have a
"soft spot" for Germany, as this physician saved my ass.


I was anxious about finishing up my studies at Ohio State and
entering the real world, but mostly I was just dying to see my college
girlfriend; because if I may boast, I'd had also ten weeks of complete
sexual abstinence, and was convinced that no girl ever had such a
loyal boyfriend travel through Europe, especially during the <i>summer
of love</i>.


Well, okay, I did have one affair. I fell in love with Eleanor's husband.


Apparently, at about this time most of Keaton's films had been
recently rediscovered and restored, and were finally being seen by a
new generation. I had only seen little snippets of his stuff on those

I knew that I was clever but I didn't know if I had the strength to
be on my own. I went from hiding behind a family that paid my way
all through university and shielded me from the "suits" who seemed
interested only in making money, war, and babies; to feeling naked,
clad only in a cap and gown, and thrown suddenly with Keatonesque
fury into near poverty and the horror of my father's death,
without the training needed to feel confident that I could land on
my feet.


But while I was levitating with joy in that darkened movie theater
for fourteen days, I wasn't afraid of anything. I was gathering
seeds of confidence for the eventful days that lay ahead. Seeing
Buster was like the first time I'd heard Lenny Bruce. They were
untouchables.


Never in my wildest crystal-ball notion of how my life would
evolve did I foresee that, thirty years later, I would be in the position
to both take the Great Stoneface's widow out for a luxurious dinner
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and to talk about his impact on me for a
TV documentary about Keaton.


<b><i>Decades and Decades Later</i></b>


Sally Marr was dying but you wouldn't know it. In her late eighties,
lying in a fifties-looking easy chair that enabled her to put her feet
up, she held court in a tiny, borderline run-down, one-bedroom
apartment in the middle of Hollywood, not far from where Lenny
had OD'd. The main reason you could never know she was close to
death was from her constant riffing, an endless stream of hilarious
recollections of her show business-soaked life. She was almost like
Bruce himself in drag, and what really struck me more than almost
anything else was the constant reminder of just how supportive she

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I couldn't help but wish she was dying in a castle instead, given
her comic royalty. But it made more sense for Lenny's mom to just
be hanging out in any old place, because, like her son, it was the
words, man—the words. She wore her language elegantly, in spite of
the shape she was in. In fact, she might as well have been back in
vaudeville; every moment when people were around seemed like a
show to her.


Prominent filmmaker Robert Weide, who made an Oscar-nominated
documentary about Lenny, let me know Sally was very ill and
that it would mean a lot to her if I visited her from time to time.
Many people loved her and stopped by, not just because she gave
birth to such a legendary son, but because of her authenticity and
her own amazing, show-business life. We had met a few times in the
past, before she got ill, oftentimes with Lenny's daughter, Kitty, and
they always made me feel, much to my delight, that I reminded
them of "the man." They never told me just how, but I like to think
I just smelled like him in all sorts of ways, and that was very cool. I
mean, if anything, as self-effacing as my act always was and is, compared
to Bruce's much broader, satiric, torrential overview on practically
everything, I always set the bar as high as I could to be as
revealing about myself as my guts would allow, much the way
Lenny was always fearless about nailing society's hypocrisy. It's a
great source of pride that Sally and Kitty dug my work and style and
that they got a little scent of Lenny around me.


Years before she got ill, I'd sent Sally a signed poster from my
Carnegie Hall concert, and eventually learned that she'd hung it up
in her little pad right next to one of Lenny's concert posters.
Through a friend I got a picture of that hallway, and hung the little
Polaroid in my own home. I always felt fucked by never seeing him
perform, never getting to hang with him and kibitz, and yet here
was his mother, nearing ninety, and she got my shtick like she was
my target audience. Imagine that shit! This was one fucking hip

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although she was too sick to attend them, lots of comics did benefits
to help raise bread for her mounting medical expenses. At one
of these shows at the Hollywood Improv I remember sitting at the
bar downing my now usual club sodas and lemon while waiting to
go on, and rapping with Shelly Berman. I mean, I was sitting there
talking to this giant of modern day stand-up comedy; it was a gas.
We were moaning and groaning (and no one can grumble as artistically
and hilariously as Mr. Berman) like struggling comics waiting
to perform during those open-mike nights, complaining about how
late the show started and about how the audience would be fucking
burned out by the time we got on. We had a ball bad-mouthing
which comics were abusing the amount of time they were supposed
to do. I was bonding with yet another idol. It was too astonishing a
moment to even begin to explain the thousands of flashbacks running
through my head, like hearing Shelly's first breakthrough
album as a teenager, or watching him on TV in the early sixties
doing these amazing monologues, each so finely crafted and delivered
like mini masterpieces. And now here I was, an old comedian
as well, slumped over and made to feel like the time was over for me
to continue to disbelieve in my success. And man, I don't mean to
boast, but when Berman and Lewis whine simultaneously, happiness
can be sucked out of a fucking carnival in Rio de Janeiro. More
importantly, the show was a moneymaker, but sadly, Sally didn't
have long to go.


The last time I saw Sally Marr was also one of the most defining
moments of my life. It was at a screening of Weide's film at CAA, a
premier Hollywood talent agency. I sat in the back row on the aisle
(I always do whenever I can, because of claustrophobia and the

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She wouldn't have missed it for the world. The show must go on.
And in Weide's documentary, Sally to some degree upstages her son,
with countless interviews that intermittently pop on the screen and
give life to the story of her deceased son's amazing, in-society's-face
rise to comedic stardom, while most of the culture pissed on his First
Amendment rights and abetted his ultimate drug drenched martyrdom.
The film is extraordinary but as it wound down I knew (having
already seen it many times privately) that soon there would be a
shot of a dead Lenny Bruce, naked, alone, and lying in his bathroom
with his drug paraphernalia, then footage of the media circus that
ensued, the police and the sleazy cameramen parading in and out.
Society got their man, even though drugs did him in; the prosecutors
enabled him as much as anyone else. The world of stand-up
comedy has been flimsy at best ever since, with perhaps Richard
Pryor as the only stunning exception, along with maybe a handful of
others (the late Bill Hicks and Sam Kinison come to mind—comedians
who pushed the envelope). Yet to me, no one ever came close to
Bruce's overpowering genius, or command of the art form.


So, there I was, starting to get a panic attack thinking that
Lenny's mom would have to actually sit through this and see that
awful shot of her dead son that so poignantly illustrated just how
Lenny was made a scapegoat for his honesty and artistry, and was
exploited, fucked over, and abused to the very end. In my own panic
about the upcoming sequence, I forgot that if you are Lenny Bruce's
mother, you aren't exactly, for openers, a mom who would groove

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then the image came up. Lenny Bruce is dead. My comic hero
was a goner, and her son was no more. I looked up at Sally and tried
to smile, but it was forced, and although I meant well, it sort of died
like a bad joke. Sally smiled back at me anyway, like she dug the
effort. Her voice at this point in her life was pretty weak and she
leaned down and whispered in my ear something that I'll never forget.
And although she was of course Lenny's mom, it's still emblazoned
<i>in my soul</i> just what it might have been like to have my
immediate family be such a supportive part of my own torment and
burning desire to express my anguish as a performer.


"So, baby?"


"What honey?" I replied pushing her damp hair back.


"Was I fuckin' funny or what?" she said.


Eleanor Keaton was cool, too, but in a much more distinguished,
classic way. Still elegant in her seventies when we became friends,
she'd been drop-dead beautiful in her heyday as an actress and
dancer, and Buster had taken some time before finally mustering up
the courage, in his middle age, to ask this "stunner" out for a date.
The romance blossomed, and seemed to keep going even after
Buster died, as Eleanor never remarried and seemed to keep her
aging beauty and dignity even more intense by always being the
woman of his dreams, and he the man of hers.


As hip and scattered as Sally was, that's how single-minded and
outspoken Eleanor was. Once an actress, always an actress. I met
Eleanor at a party given by the producers of an A&E; biography of

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can't remember exactly why but months went by after that,
maybe even a few years, before I finally felt confident enough to
give Eleanor a call. She shrugged off my apology for the lengthy time
between my suggestion and my call like it was a forty-years-ago
audition, and she hadn't gotten the part, and had long ago moved
on.


"So Eleanor, you live in the valley, so I mean, we could go somewhere
nearby you."


"Why?"


"Uh ... no real reason. Then, how about a dinner at the Beverly
Hills Hotel?"


"Sounds great."


"You sure it wouldn't be better to go to a place closer to you?"


"No. You said the Beverly Hills Hotel and that sounds great."


"It's a date."


I was suddenly thrown into a panic. I was going to be alone with
Buster's widow for hours and hours and I freaked. I mean, holy shit!
What the fuck was I going to talk about besides the millions of
queries I had about how it was to be with him, and what did she
know about every possible question I had about my silent hero? To
avoid my nervousness I faxed the maître d' at the Polo Lounge and
the general manager of the hotel, and told them I was coming in
with this extraordinary woman. Although I told them it was an
important dinner for me they didn't know why, except that I was a
comedian they liked, Buster was an idol of mine, and this was his
renowned widow who I wanted to be treated like gold. Ironically,

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had arranged for roses to be sent to the table at the most propitious
time during our evening. I trusted the instincts of one of the
most famous restaurants in the world to do what was right. They
were perfect from soup to nuts. (I being the nut.)


Man oh man, we had THE TABLE, and everyone treated her like
a goddess. Mrs. Keaton this ... Mrs. Keaton that ... Mrs. Keaton
what an honor. Whew! I was so grateful—until I had to talk. Let it be
known that I can be at a loss for words. I became my own silent
movie! I choked. Most kids dream of winning a World Series with a
home run; for me, glory was having the chance to ask famous people
in the world of comedy anything on my mind. I briefly blew the
audition. At least Buster occasionally had a script or a story idea to
work from. I just had steak and fear. I was a wreck. I felt out of sorts,
her husband meant so much to me, and yet at the same time I

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eleanor made it easy. She intuitively felt my love for Buster and
was immediately open to my slightest curiosity. Whereas Sally
would riff, Eleanor gave stirring lectures on the history of old Hollywood,
on both the husband she'd loved and her understanding of
the superstar he was, even though she had been too young to fully
appreciate the power of that moment when he burst on the scene
and changed so much about combining the use of a camera with the
soul of a persona. She had an amazing presence about her that let
me know how formidable she must have been half a century earlier,
when men were left gasping for breath by her beauty. She seemed
not only to enjoy the attention, but to feel very much at ease with it.
It wasn't the disgusting type of egotism that many actresses display,
but one of tremendous self-confidence; of a sense of her place in history.
More than anything about her that I loved—Keaton groupie
that I unashamedly am—was her total dedication to making sure
that Buster knew before he died just what an icon he really was,
even when he might have had reason to think that no one cared
who he was anymore nor remembered anything about his amazing
body of work.


Lenny, sadly, didn't care to stop drugs from killing him. Buster,
although an alcoholic, led a wonderful life with Eleanor and apparently
was able in his later years to nurture a glass of beer every now
and then without ever spinning out of control again. I asked her
about this. I told her that my own drinking days were over but she
just gracefully smiled and made it seem that it was hardly her business.
Still, I wanted to know how Buster was able to enjoy his life
after he'd stopped falling all over himself (and <i>not</i> with magnificent

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387555-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eleanor spoke very freely and with a great sense of pride about
how much Buster enjoyed his life creatively, well after he was out of
the Hollywood mansions and the limelight, be it with little TV
appearances or even commercials, which were not only fun paydays
but enabled him to show flashes of his immense authenticity and
originality. She flashed a quick grin when reminding me just how
much fun they had together, living modestly and yet appreciating
their time together, sharing their love of dogs and enjoying a gang of
great friends who were always around to add merriment to their
lives. I also learned from Her that Buster wasn't tortured late in life
by not doing more, but actually loved doing less. And she would
know.


These two kings of comedy both died in the same year and one tragically
didn't have to. And yet their legacies remain intact, and as
much as I wish Lenny had found his Eleanor, he had a Sally, a
mother who early on pushed her son to be an earth-shattering
humorist, continuing to nudge him as far as his guts and brain and
balls would let him <i>cook</i>. And although she wasn't responsible for his
tragic overdose, she is regarded primarily as a kooky yet sublime catalyst
for his emergence as the most articulate hipster of all time. And
to think that both these women were friends of mine. Wow! Mindblowing!


Now if I can only manage to figure out a way to take Gena Rowlands
out for tea, I'd be a happy man.
