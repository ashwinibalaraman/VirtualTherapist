BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, [PATIENT NAME], you look like you are doing very well. You look like you got a new haircut, looks like you've been, um.
<b>PT:</b> Growing it.
<b>DR:</b> Growing it. You look like you lost weight and stuff. You look trim. You look healthy.
<b>PT:</b> I look like I lost weight?
<b>DR:</b> You look thinner since the last time.
<b>PT:</b> I do?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no? I haven't seen you since February, so.
<b>PT:</b> I've gained weight.
<b>DR:</b> Have you gained weight?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, yknow, the thing is, you don't look, I mean, to me weight is like blood pressure. Yknow, it changes throughout the day and weight changes throughout the days and weeks. Yknow, you've never been obese as far as I've known you and you've never been, yknow, um, sickly thin. So you're always in that normal range, right?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Anyway, the last time I saw you, you were doing, for the most part, well, still had some excessive worry that you acknowledged was a bit much especially with your kids. But, um, yknow, still some obsessional thoughts about the glasses and we talked about different options. And so at that point we raised the Zoloft from 100 mg to 150. Um, which you have been on religiously since then I guess. The Ativan, half a mg you've been taking twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> No, I take that as needed.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, good, that's better, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> But I've been using it, actually I've been using it a lot at night because I'm so wound up by the time I go to bed because the summer is so much more active, um, yknow, we're running around, running around, running around, but, uh, yeah, I have a hard time falling asleep. So I've actually been using it to get to sleep so that I can, yknow, come down to a, last night I took it 'cause I knew a quarter after ten I knew that I would still be laying there at eleven fifteen. So I took it and as soon as it kicked in I fell asleep.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want you to be taking that like clockwork all the time because.
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't.
<b>DR:</b> I don't want you to get hooked on it.
<b>PT:</b> Only like once or twice a week.
<b>DR:</b> That's all right.
<b>PT:</b> Nothing big. But my concern is like I said to you on the phone yesterday is, um, why I didn't want the family doctor to start to take over the Zoloft prescription. By the way, the generic gives me heartburn. Sertraline. 
<b>DR:</b> Sertraline.
<b>PT:</b> It gives me heartburn.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, it's funny. I do have some people who have not done well, as well and so we, they paid the extra few bucks to get the brand.
<b>PT:</b> I'm considering it because I get heartburn every night when I take my medicine. I have to take Rolaids with it.
<b>DR:</b> Um, well, yknow, that's been an issue and, uh, it depends, like I have some people who pay, yknow, it's a matter of an extra ten, fifteen bucks a month, which is no big deal if, um, if it's a lot of money then you have to weigh that, yknow. You could buy a whole lot of Tums if it's going to be fifty bucks a month or something like that, whatever.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, my only concern was moving into the winter months. I mean, the children are going to be obviously that's been an issue for a while. Um, and I haven't had any issues with my glasses. I got new glasses after we got back from Disney in March.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I love them. And I haven't really had any issues at all since the 150 kicked in and, um, and I like them.
<b>DR:</b> How about moods, [PATIENT NAME], no depression?
<b>PT:</b> No, I was depressed here and there. Yknow, just all of a sudden plummet for no reason.
<b>DR:</b> Over what kind of things?
<b>PT:</b> No reason. Yknow, that's typical of the issues.
<b>DR:</b> Are you, um, what's the story with your husband? He doesn't have a clue yet whether he got the position or not? Is it something that would be like in the next weeks, months, year?
<b>PT:</b> Weeks or months.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So would they sell the house for you?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> They would be tickled with that.
<b>PT:</b> And that would be a serious issue. My thing, and I was telling my dad, um, was, when we didn't know that my stomach pain was the cause of things, my thing, and actually I have had a lot of anxiety lately. When I get anxiety, like I think about mood and like that, whew, right down and my feet hurt. Right down my legs. And that's my big indicator that I'm having too much anxiety because my feet hurt really bad. And I just, as soon as you said that to me, when I move the anxiety shot right down the legs.
<b>DR:</b> Well, yknow, so it's not if, it's just, if you expect to stay married to this guy you gotta move, right?
<b>PT:</b> Well, yeah, and I kinda like him, so.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. Now the kids, how old are the kids?
<b>PT:</b> Five and three.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, so it's not.
<b>PT:</b> No, we've agreed that we would sign a three year contract and be back by the time [NAME OTHER] was nine before he starts the adolescent years where it would [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's not like he's, yknow, in tenth grade or something and that would be hard.
<b>PT:</b> No. I think you're familiar with the fact of how many problems I had when I was a teenager and how it's affected me as an adult.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, still to this day, I mean, I was even just on the phone on the way over here with a friend of mine who I've known since ninth grade who actually went through all that with me. And I said, uh, yeah, I said I'll just mass email to all my friends that I have pumpkin spice coffee now, it's a fall thing that I do with my friends. But I said you know me, we're not all going to get together for coffee, you can all come over one at a time. That's how badly I was affected when I was a teenager. She said I know, I know. Yknow, I don't mix people at all because of those problems. But, um, we're coming into the winter months, even though the kids are going to be in school and everything, I do see, I really have noticed, um, because we spoke about this earlier in the year, how much the sunlight and things affect me 'cause over the summer when it would rain and things like that and the kids were stuck in the house I could barely function all day. It was just like the blah as soon as the sun goes in. Yknow, and that's an issue, yknow, and that's when the anxiety really starts to usually kick in and I kind of head towards the deep end by Christmastime. Come September when the sun's not out until seven o'clock, it's not light, yknow, four o'clock comes and all I want to do is crawl up on the couch with a cup of coffee. And, um, and I've really, really noticed because we had discussed if that was an issue before that it is. It really is. I have such a hard time getting through the day if it's raining and it's not nice weather or if it's overcast like that whole week that it was overcast, I think it was last week or the week before, it was horrible. It was absolutely horrible.
<b>DR:</b> Well.
<b>PT:</b> It makes me so depressed it just makes me not want to function.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. And I told you that with people who have noticed that seasonal component that we either increase the dosage or add something for the winter months, and then we'd take it away. And it's worked out fine for most people. Um, the question is, yknow, is it that you need more Zoloft or should we add something?
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> And that's something that we have to figure out.
<b>PT:</b> And that's, of course, why I don't want to give up my care with you and go to the family doctor to just get my Zoloft because I think it is more, yknow, I do have, 'cause coming out it starts. Everybody knows with me for the last two or three years because, yknow, I had the episode two years ago where I'd gone off the medicine and I called you and everything, and, um, everybody knows with me that come September I start to like that.
<b>DR:</b> Now in January of this year, beginning of the year, you were not doing well, had some numbness in your face.
<b>PT:</b> That was from the Celexa, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And then we switched back to the Zoloft. And we talked about maybe adding, um, Wellbutrin. I don't know, did you do that at that point or no?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So that was January.
<b>PT:</b> That was the one thing we had talked about 'cause I had gone to the neurologist because I have the problem with my ear and I said, yknow, I guess you're going to have to do, and I called you that day and I said I guess you're gonna have to do the surgery on my ear because my face is numb because I had been on the Celexa for those couple months. And he said it's not your ear, it's your medication. And then when I called you and I got off the Celexa and everything, everything went back to normal. I went back to my good old self, yknow. I don't have any problems with my face or anything like that anymore.
<b>DR:</b> And, [PATIENT NAME], you -
<b>PT:</b> So I'm not ever going to consider abandoning Zoloft again. It's just adjusting some things when the winter months come and it's dark and.
<b>DR:</b> Well, the 150s the highest you've been on, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes. That I've stayed. I have been up to it before, um, briefly. This is the longest I've ever stayed on it though.
<b>DR:</b> And we've done BuSpar before with that which.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, and we did that because of the sex drive thing.
<b>DR:</b> Right. Well, I don't know, [PATIENT NAME]. I mean, your guess is as good as mine on this one. Sometimes, yknow, more of the same will improve things. Sometimes it's like, yknow, once your gas tank is full of gas, the more you pour, it just pours out, doesn't do anything, right?
<b>PT:</b> No, I worry about that because I'm only [AGE] and I do worry about that because, yknow, if it happens when it does get to a point where that's it, yknow, and it's like, well, I've still got another thirty years to go or something like that. I was like then what am I gonna do because I obviously need it to function. I'm a light person.
<b>DR:</b> No, I'm talking about just as terms of the near future here. I mean, like I had a guy who had, he was taking like 400 or 500 mg of Zoloft which is like two or three times what the manufacturer recommends.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b> No, no, he wasn't. Um, and we were able to cut it down and we added something else. We could never get it down below 300 though. He never had any problems. But 200 is considered to be the ceiling on that. Now if we go to 200 that could be.
<b>PT:</b> During the winter months?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, during the winter months, just for the, yknow, couple three months, that could be all you need. Um, probably the easiest thing to do because it's not like we're introducing a new drug and new potential for side effects and it's either gonna have, yknow, no effect, uh, or it'll have a positive effect. Um, and, um, yknow, we'll see, yknow, it comes in 100 mg, so if it doesn't do. So instead of taking one and a half you'd just take two.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And you can always go back to one and a half if it's too much for you.
<b>PT:</b> Excuse me, I'm recovering from bronchitis.
<b>DR:</b> I'm wondering also, yknow, I just thought of this, since you take it every day faithfully what you could even do, you could take 150 one day and 200 the other day and kind of alternate back and forth.
<b>PT:</b> During the winter months.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, if the 200 is too much for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Now if the 200 doesn't cause any problems and doesn't add anything, there's no point to taking 200 if it doesn't help. At that point, give me a call, we'll try something else. Yknow, we'll add something different to the Zoloft but the quickest and easiest thing to do is just to, um, is just to bump it up and see. If that's all you need.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. I mean, it'll start, yknow, like right now, I mean, you're familiar with the weather patterns and things like that. It's not getting, I mean, the light is going to start to diminish, but the cold and having to be stuck in the house and everything all day isn't going to start for another month. Yknow, I'm still fine right now. Um, would you want me to call you then when I was going to start to take the 200 to let you know the beginning of it?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, of course. Of course, you could do that.
<b>PT:</b> That it's working.
<b>DR:</b> Of course. Um, what we'll do is, um, instead of getting, you do the mail order, instead of getting 135, we'll get 180, which would be for two a day. So worse case, yknow, you get some extras there. Um, but, um, yknow, if you need them you just take them through the winter.
<b>PT:</b> Does it do anything, does it make a difference because I mean I know it has the, yknow, the anxiety component and everything, does it make a difference at all if you take it, yknow, if I get up in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, morning or night? No.
<b>PT:</b> I mean if I were to take the added extra in the middle of the day?
<b>DR:</b> No, it shouldn't.
<b>PT:</b> It wouldn't help at all?
<b>DR:</b> No, I mean.
<b>PT:</b> Because it's not short term.
<b>DR:</b> No.
<b>PT:</b> It doesn't work that short term. It's not like Ativan.
<b>DR:</b> No, it's not like that at all. So it's just going to, it doesn't really matter. The only time, we tell people to take it at the same time just because, so it becomes a habit and they don't forget it. But, no, it's not like you take it, it's more effective for the first few hours and then peters out. It doesn't happen like that.
<b>PT:</b> It's definitely, it's not an anxiety thing with the, yknow, the raininess and things like that. It's not anxiety. It's just boom, I don't feel like doing anything at all.
<b>DR:</b> Seasonality with the.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm not a I don't feel like doing anything at all kind of person 'cause when I don't feel like doing anything at all I'm, there's a problem. When I don't want to get out of bed, there's definitely an issue.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. We'll try this and see if it works. What's your sister's name?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> All right. I bumped into somebody.
<b>PT:</b> She's heavyset, [NAME OTHER], my nephew, he comes here, right?
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, I thought there was a woman I saw, I bumped into on the street and I thought it was your sister and, um, she had her name tag, so. No, no, no, this was somewhere else in the western strata out of all places [DEIDENTIFIED], but when you see someone out of context you don't put two and two together. So now I had the advantage that she had a name tag. I didn't have a name tag on me. She said to me, you look familiar to me. I said, and I knew, yknow, and she said, um, how do I know you. I said, um, well, think about it, yknow, you might, yknow, it might come to you. Sometimes it's harder to be around somebody, other people, you don't want to, yknow what I mean, it's embarrassing for some. But, um, so I don't know if she, but I was talking to this other guy for five minutes and then I left and I don't know if it hit her.
<b>PT:</b> I'll ask her then.
<b>DR:</b> No, it wasn't her.
<b>PT:</b> It wasn't. Yeah, because the only reason [NAME OTHER] would have on a name tag is if she's going to an event.
<b>DR:</b> I knew it was different than your name. And, um, this is a different name. This name began with an F. I wasn't sure if that was your sister. 
<b>PT:</b> Not me.
<b>DR:</b> Kind of heavy?
<b>PT:</b> My sister?
<b>DR:</b> Your sister gotten heavier? Really?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know what she's doing right now. She's always doing something. She's never even been my size now.
<b>DR:</b> Well, it's interesting.
<b>PT:</b> Since she was like eight.
<b>DR:</b> It's interesting that your dad had that problem.
<b>PT:</b> Well, honestly I kept saying, yknow, well, I said, yknow, maybe it's the Celexa because I have such a problem with Celexa and I had the [INAUDIBLE] of the face and everything.
<b>DR:</b> They didn't have GI effects, there's no question about it.
<b>PT:</b> And then, yknkow, this just kept going on and on and on since February. And I went over a couple weeks ago and I took the anxiety and trivia workbook and then, um, their medical doctor who I think is a complete, um, moron, um, because, yknow, she didn't do anything, didn't find us or anything, um, uh, found blood in his urine. I went on the Internet and it said blood in your urine's perfectly normal. Every person excretes so many whatever it was blood and the balance of it winds up in your urine which is microscopical of course which is what they had found. And I went over and I said it doesn't have anything to do with this. This is completely normal. I just brought this up on the Internet. Yknow, we're at our wits' end. We're at our last thing here because he had been in the hospital, um, and they didn't find it. They did every test known to man and they didn't find the abnormality in his small bowel. And I said, yknow, it's gotta be anxiety, dad, you must just be so overwhelmed because he is, he had problems. I mean, he's.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but he's not a quack. He knows.
<b>PT:</b> No, he's not a quack, but he does, yknow, we do believe that he has depression problems and he has always been very, um, possessive of my mother and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That aggravates things, but he's a genuine.
<b>PT:</b> Right. And the perfection thing, yknow. Nobody can work at the house because they might do it wrong. And, um, yknow, and I said, here, yknow, read about it, blah, blah, blah, this book does encourage you to not use medication. Um, and I said, yknow, maybe you'll start to feel better because maybe your trigger is like with my feet, the minute I feel anxiety I can barely walk because my feet hurt so bad.
<b>DR:</b> He had the book 'cause he's like a school kid, he had the book with the pen in there, he was reading and taking notes. He was taking it seriously.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. Because he does need help. But I said, yknow, maybe it's your stomach because I get anxiety if my feet hurt, sometimes I can barely walk if I get the real bad anxiety.
<b>DR:</b> I think, you know, I'm fond of your dad. I think that, I really would have worries about him, yknow, if your mom passed before him he would be in bad shape.
<b>PT:</b> He has been in love with my mother since she was [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> So hopefully.
<b>PT:</b> He is struggling though with the sale of the business. Yknow, now he's for once in his life doesn't have anywhere he needs to be.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, but he's got other irons in the fire.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but he is struggling. And they did say, yknow, because if he has a bad day with it, if he goes out and can't drum up any business for the sharpening business he goes nuts. He won't talk to her for a week. And they feed off of each other. And that's when he came by and I knew that he wasn't on anything and it was about two months ago and he was out drumming up business and, but he gets that, it worries me because, yknow, when I get real, real bad with the anxiety you can't focus on anything. It's completely distracting. You don't want anybody to talk to you because you're so distracted with the anxiety. And you can see that. And he came in and just, yknow, he doesn't, he's not listening really to anything anybody's saying. And I said, dad, I said, yknow, are you going to go see [PHYSICIAN NAME] I said, 'cause, yknow, you don't seem good. You seem distracted and depressed. And they called you a couple days later.
<b>DR:</b> Well, he trusts you and trusts your mom. But he doesn't trust a whole lot of other people. And he also is a stubborn guy, yknow. So he's going to do what he wants to do. It's gotta make sense to him. Yknow, he's like from the old school. Yknow, whatever, but he'll make his way all right.
<b>PT:</b> I just worry that, yknow, I want him to follow up with you again because especially with the winter months coming and as soon as he does, I mean, they said it's going to be a two month recovery, yknow, he should be back to normal by the end of November, first of.
<b>DR:</b> They cut him.
<b>PT:</b> Yes. They put a small incision right here. And with modern technology of course the surgeon comes out. His name's [[PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]. I call him Dr. Fiji, some funky, with his Palm Pilot showing us his guts inside and outside of him, the purple guts, yeah. And, um, on the table and on inside him the purple, there was a line that it was, it was like chopped up. Yeah, it was like purple, then not purple, then purple, then not purple. And, um, but I just worry that once he does start to get back on his feet, yknow, he'll get discouraged with the sharpening business or whatever, and then he'll plummet and he'll come into family functions.
<b>DR:</b> He's a survivor.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but he's been like this for years. He comes into family functions and he doesn't say anything and he's real quiet and he acts like a victim. And he's completely distracted and he's not paying attention or anything 'cause when he was on the Celexa this was at Easter, he came in and he had gone up to the 40 mg, but we were all worried that the Celexa was causing his stomach problem. And, um, he was, we hadn't seen him like that in years when he was on the 40 mg of Celexa. He was alive, he was happy, he was participating in everything. He was talking.
<b>DR:</b> Well, now that he knows that it stops the bowel problems.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Of course I wonder if he thinks maybe the Celexa somehow was responsible for that.
<b>PT:</b> No, he knows it's the Crohn's.
<b>DR:</b> But I'm wondering if he would be more willing or less willing now to go back on.
<b>PT:</b> No, I think he would be quite willing. But now he knows that it's not causing the stomach problems, so he would be more willing to go.
<b>DR:</b> I'd be happy to talk to your dad on the telephone. I'd spend as much time as he needs to. 
<b>PT:</b> Don't let him lie to you because.
<b>DR:</b> I don't read minds.
<b>PT:</b> On 40 mg of Celexa we had our dad back at a family function for the first time in years.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> I mean, he was making cookies with everybody else. For the last couple of years he goes and sits in a chair and doesn't bother with anybody, barely talks to anybody. He'll play with my kids and stuff only because they're on top of him. Yknow, forcing him, but that's it.
<b>DR:</b> All right. [PATIENT NAME], does, um, did you decide whether you want to try the generic still or do the brand?
<b>PT:</b> Of the Zoloft?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> Because I can, well, if you have some, I can fax this to them but I have to, you have to decide, I can hold this for a while if you want to give it a, you want to call them and see what the price difference is?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I need it. I need them to mail it to me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, what do you want me to do?
<b>PT:</b> Just fax it over. And then if I continue.
<b>DR:</b> For generic?
<b>PT:</b> No, do regular. Do the, yeah, because every night I go to, I'm not a heartburn person, I've never had problems like that. And as soon as I swallow that pill, I get heartburn, yknow, and then that contributes to me not being able to go to sleep too 'cause I'm laying there with heartburn. So, um, I would rather just have the regular stuff.
<b>DR:</b> So Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> If they want to call me to discuss it, yknow, 'cause they're going to try to force the generic on me, that's fine.
<b>DR:</b> No, they won't.
<b>PT:</b> So. No, it's uncomfortable.
<b>DR:</b> All right. I've gotta put a note down here.
<b>PT:</b> But I certainly didn't want you to think that I was taking any of your -
