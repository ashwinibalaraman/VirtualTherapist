BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> How are you?
<b>PT:</b> I thought I'd be a little bit better than I am -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not really all that bad.  I'm functioning better I think, except that I find myself going to back to some of the things that I was doing before all this happened, rushing around, if I go to do something, I have to hurry and do it even though there's nothing to do for the next half hour.
<b>DR:</b> Is that at work, you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Work, at home, everywhere.  If I'm at home doing something, dishes, I have to do them real fast.  This is more pronounced than it was before.  I don't remember being this way.
<b>DR:</b> Well, when you get done with the task, what do you do next, is there always something to do?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Like you rush for one thing to the next to the next.  You rush to get something done.
<b>PT:</b> For no reason
<b>DR:</b> And then relax in between?
<b>PT:</b> Then I go sit, I'll go sit down in the other room but, of course, I'll sit there for five or ten minutes, then I'll get up and do something else.  It's almost like, it's almost like I'm rushing just to rush, so then I had slowed down, I had it in my mind to try to be slower about everything, try to move slower
<b>DR:</b> Or maybe paced, that's a good word.
<b>PT:</b> Rather than just, well everything I do, I'm like jumpy at doing it instead of just going slower.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> I jump and I have to get everything done quick and the other thing, I'm having a hard time sleeping.
<b>DR:</b> Still?
<b>PT:</b> I wake up every couple of hours.  Part of it I think is probably the back pain, I have a lot of back pain, I have more actually now, I don't know, but I have to go back to the doctor.
<b>DR:</b> They didn't change any of the pain medications?
<b>PT:</b> I haven't been to that doctor, so now, the only pain medication I ever take is Darvocet.  
<b>DR:</b> Do you take one close to bedtime?
<b>PT:</b> Yes and I take one, I have to take one when I get up in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Or I take just over the counter [INAUDIBLE] but I don't take Tylenol because Ibuprofen I usually take and I find that, you know, I try to push all these things to the back of my head that I worry about but then they come forward.
<b>DR:</b> Well, tell me what your biggest worries are, like let them come forward here.  What are the worries today?
<b>PT:</b> Well the thing that I worry about is, things that I worry about, I don't know, I mean obviously I can make this [INAUDIBLE], what am I going to do when I retire.  Well, why am I worried about that?  I have no ability to retire, I don't have the financial ability.  What will happen if I have to retire because of my health, that worries me.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Well, the first worry, when will you know that you're financially ready to retire?  How will you know?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my mortgage will be paid off, I'll have equity in my mortgage because I have to have more equity into the house before I retire, so that when I sell the house, I'll have more equity that I can put down on another home. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, do you, are you working with a retirement planner or an investment person or a financial planner?
<b>PT:</b> I'm working with a man who has an account that's, other people have the same account, it's a money merge account where you pay and it's totally, it's very difficult for me to explain but it's, you have equity - 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, my background is not finance, I'm not asking for those thinkgs -
<b>PT:</b> So that takes, you know, that way I am and then all the other things, you know, I'm doing that I think [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> You know, I guess my point in asking those questions is that sometimes when you worry about something that may not be your field or what you do each day, you go to people for advise or go to people for guidance, you know, if you're buying a house you have a real estate agent to help guide you.  If you're [INAUDIBLE] in your back then you go the orthopaedic doctor to help guide you.  If you're looking at retirement and you're worrying about it, sometimes having somebody that's experienced with retirement planning can help you, many good financial planners get to know their clients values, not just where they are, but what their hopes and wants are so they structure retirement.  I've seen a lot of different companies that have like, well if you have this, if you want this lifestyle, this is how you plan.  If you want this lifestyle, this is how you plan, and they help set realistic goals for it, depending on what stage you are.  Do you find this person that helps you with the account supportive or reassuring?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Or kind of helps you with the reality of okay this is where you are financially and this is where you want to be so this is what you have to do?
<b>PT:</b> Right, that's what he does.
<b>DR:</b> Good, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I've talked to a couple people who are knowledgeable in that area, so [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> But do you find their advice reassuring?
<b>PT:</b> I do, it's just, that's why I don't know, I don't understand why I'm worrying about it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm worrying about things, I don't know why I'm worrying about them.  
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, one thing, you use the term that when the worries come up, you try to push them to the back.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Well, if they come to the front, maybe it's just thinking them through, you know, telling yourself, out loud, I don't know your financial planners name but [NAME OTHER] told me at the last meeting that it's fine, you know, instead of trying to push it back and not think about it, well, play it out.  I mean you're worried about it so you reassure yourself that, you know, the last person I talked to thinks it's fine, you know, and he's knowledgeable, he's my advisor, he sees it as being fine.  You know, because eventually, you know, a retirement will be there for you and, hopefully, something to look forward to.  Hopefully, you'll meet your financial goals, it's something that, you know, it's a part of everyone's work like in many respects.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You know, retirement and I think you want to be able to retire with your own terms and something that you're making a decision on for yourself and nobody else is making for you, that your back isn't making for you or that your boss isn't making for you or, you know, it's something that you're making for yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Right, that's the truth and I don't, you know, I don't really know why I worry about something like this, then I say well where would you want to go and then all of the sudden I start worrying about that.  It's like I'm finding all these things to worry about as I get older.  I'm lonely, I have no, but I have all these people around me, like my family is around me, it just doesn't, it doesn't make any sense to me, it's bothering me.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know, there's nothing wrong with thinking about when you do retire, what would you want or what would you like or what's available, you know, because if you have an idea that, okay, you want to move to, [DEIDENTIFIED] or something like that, hypothetically, I really would like a condominium there when I retire, you know, it's a nice community or, you know, what's available and what's the process, there's nothing wrong with looking around and thinking about it and having an idea, not worry about it but, you know, spend a few moments just talking with friends or looking around, there's nothing wrong with that.  Do you know what I'm saying?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do.
<b>DR:</b> Instead of worrying about it, say well I don't know enough about these things and I don't know where I want to be at this point, I don't have to decide today but, you know, maybe I want to get, I want to call up a place and get some information, get a pamphlet, you know, or get some information down at the old [DEIDENTIFIED] properties they're building all those [AGE] and older communities there.
<b>PT:</b> Right. 
<b>DR:</b> Again, these are all hypothetical.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I got some information from one place.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I haven't gone to see it but it's, it's going to be out of my league, you know, it probably will be.
<b>DR:</b> Visit a bunch of different places, then you have things to compare them to.  Maybe if it's not financially but maybe there are parts of it that you really like that you'll find and be more clear in your mind what you like, that'll be at other places too, you know, maybe the place has a really good clubhouse and exercise program and then you go to another place that has that as well and you remember, you know, that's something that I hadn't thought about that I want to look for in a place, so looking around is not a bad thing.  If you don't have a specific place in mind already, look at several, it's okay, you know, and just having the confidence that you'll, when the time is right, have all the information, you'll have thought it through so you're confident in the decision.  There's no rush to make the decision.
<b>PT:</b> No, there's not.
<b>DR:</b> But yet to try to avoid thinking about it may make you feel more, you know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> So that's what I shouldn't do, not try to push it.
<b>DR:</b> You know, unless it's, I mean yeah, it's Christmas Eve and you need to be with your kids and, you know, your family wants you to be present with them at the moment and you're thinking about retirement communities then, yeah, maybe that's the time to push it in the back of your mind because, you know, obviously there's something else you have to attend to.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Christmas Eve and presents or whatever but there are other times that, you know, maybe you're pushing it in the back of your mind when thinking it through might actually be better, do you know what I'm saying?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> Not feeling like you have to swallow the feeling or push the feeling down or keep it inside, go with it and think it through to a resolution, do you know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh, yeah, I do and then the loneliness is just like, I don't understand why I feel lonely.  I mean I live by myself but then I think if I lived with somebody, there would be more activity around me and that would be fine but, you know, there's certainly another part of that I wouldn't like because I've been by myself for over ten years now.  You know, I would have, you know, if I lived with my daughter, I'm afraid that we would get on each other's nerves or, you know, I would [INAUDIBLE] and I would hate to ruin our relationship. 
<b>DR:</b> Do you miss a companion?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's not even so much that, it's just it's so quiet.  You know, I have little dogs, they're dogs, they're not people.
<b>DR:</b> Right, do you miss a companion?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do, I miss, I always had five people in the house and now I'm there by myself and I don't know, maybe it's just catching up that my husband died, how many years, ninety six, eleven years ago, twelve years ago, my mom died, that was seven years ago, it's just, and the other thing that is really, really, really getting to me is the back, the back problem, the shingles with the neuralgia pain and all the pain that I'm in all the time is just really starting to work on me because I can't do anything.  I can't even pick up a box so that's frustrating me, it's overwhelming me that I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You have a follow up visit with the back doctor, right?
<b>PT:</b> Tomorrow, if I can wait that long because it started to hurt worse.
<b>DR:</b> We have you on the Cymbalta and you're taking 60 once a day, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I take 60 once a day.
<b>DR:</b> Now you were really doing well when we increased it from 30 to 60.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You felt much better.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Well, one of the things that we could do, I mean the dose of Cymbalta for depression alone is 30 or 60.  The depression dose when you're dealing with neuropathic pain, I'm sorry, the dose, not for depression but for neuropathic pain, the dosage ranges from 60 to 60 twice a day.  When people take it for pain, for neuropathy, they take it 60 twice a day.  Now you've done well with it for depression on the 60 but you're not at the maximum you can go.  If you're still dealing with a lot of pain and the Cymbalta has been helpful with the depression, we could increase it to twice a day, 60 in the morning and 60 at dinnertime.
<b>PT:</b> Would that keep me awake at night?
<b>DR:</b> It shouldn't because Cymbalta is not necessarily activating.  For you, it sounds like your sleep at night is more because of discomfort, the pain that keeps you up, so the thought is that if we try to increase the Cymbalta up to the dose that is a dose for pain management that maybe it'll help you be able to experience pain a little bit less, be able to relax at bedtime, allow the Restoril dose to be effective again and more effective because my guess is it sounds like it makes sense that Restoril wouldn't keep you asleep long if you're having discomfort and pain too because the sedatives like Librium and Restoril don't treat pain, they just are more sedatives.  The Cymbalta you were doing real well with for the depression at 60 but knowing that 120 treats pain - 
<b>PT:</b> Now I still have the depression, is the Cymbalta - 
<b>DR:</b> Increasing the dose could help with the depression too; although 60 twice a day is more the dose for chronic pain.   If the pain was less then I think your mood would be better too.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I was thinking, like if I was, if I was able to do more of the things that I was able to do before and if I, at this point, I just don't know, I'm just kind of overwhelmed right now.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think, you know, given that you're already on these particular medications, the Darvocet is there for breakthrough for pain, that it seems to me it would make sense to try to use what you're already on as opposed to starting something new or, you know, add something else in.  That's one thing, at least with your medications that I see as an option for you.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh
<b>DR:</b> And one that may help more with the pain components.  If the pain is less, I imagine your depression will be a little bit better, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Probably if I sleep.
<b>DR:</b> And maybe if the pain is less that, you know, you won't be fearing losing control with the decision for retirement which I think is the issue, that you can't retire yet financially and your fear is that you'd be forced to retire because of these pain issues and not being able to do all that you did twenty years ago.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> You know, but my guess is that if the pain is better treated, then you'll have more confidence that the decision for retirement remains with you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And not with your body, you know what I mean?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I do, I know exactly what you mean because that is very scary to me.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and I think that's the true, I mean it's the pain but the pain and how it may force changes in your life that you don't want and can't have.
<b>PT:</b> And here's the thing that happens is I get up and I go to work but when I get up and after I've taken my medication, you know, I'm fine, I have energy, I do this, I do all the things, go to work and from the time in the afternoon I start to get a little tired and then by the time I get home, sometimes I can't even, I feel like I can't even do anything else and then I just sit.
<b>DR:</b> You know, then if the pain is an issue and you're having a long day, maybe you're fatigued and hurt, then maybe it is, maybe Cymbalta, again, at dinnertime would make a difference or late in the afternoon.  I think it might help with your evenings, help you have a little more energy, feel a little less pain and be able to then pace yourself and not feel fatigued.  If you're struggling with fatigue, it would make sense that you have these bursts of energy to try to get through everything.
<b>PT:</b> That's what happens, like last night.
<b>DR:</b> Like you're sprinting a race.
<b>PT:</b> That's exactly what I'm doing.  Last night, I came home from work and I had cooked dinner, got it all ready, my daughter was there, she was [INAUDIBLE], she was doing something else and my grandson, so we sat down and we ate and everything, I cleaned up, I was so proud of myself.  I sat down and woke up at midnight.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so it's like, you know, you rush to get through things because if you slow down you might slow down too slow, you know, and fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b> And then if I'm awake, then if I can't go back to sleep - 
<b>DR:</b> But the nice thing though is that, you know, if you are that tired or that fatigued, even though that was early, you were able to sleep from that point in time till midnight, you know, you could fall asleep.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> It's just not the time that you want, not the time you wanted to.
<b>PT:</b> I'll be up at four o'clock or I'm up every couple of hours, that's what's happening.
<b>DR:</b> Well, my suggestion is that we raise the Cymbalta up to twice a day.  Now are you off work tomorrow or are you off -
<b>PT:</b> I'm off all weekend.
<b>DR:</b> All weekend, so, oh, today's Friday, right.
<b>PT:</b> Today is Friday.
<b>DR:</b> Saturday, Sunday - 
<b>PT:</b> And Monday I have half a day.
<b>DR:</b> Half day, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm off Tuesday.
<b>DR:</b> Well, if you want to start it, you can start it today even.  I was going to give you off work tomorrow and Sunday to see how you feel with it.  I think you'll be fine because you've done well with the Cymbalta all along.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> It wasn't a big deal going from 30 to 60.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So I think you're going to be fine going from 60 to 120.  Again, give it a few weeks to really help with the pain and the depression.   What I would do is I'd take it late in the afternoon, between four and six.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Do you usually eat around that time too?
<b>PT:</b> Six, usually probably by the time we get it ready or - 
<b>DR:</b> So take it with you.  I mean I don't like to add in extra pills if you're already on a schedule with morning and evening but it is better not to take this at bedtime, it's better to take it like during your waking hours.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> So like anywhere between four and six that's convenient for you to get into a routine.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> We'll increase it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Well, what about, now I was taking the Neurontin for the pain.
<b>DR:</b> The shingle pain and that helps with neuropathic chronic pain too.
<b>PT:</b> So should I discontinue taking Neurontin?
<b>DR:</b> You were prescribed that from?
<b>PT:</b> [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> And did he increase it at all at any point?
<b>PT:</b> No, it was changed, you changed it from, I was taking it three times a day.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh
<b>PT:</b> And it was, I started taking it at bedtime, three of them at bedtime.
<b>DR:</b> Right, taking 300.
<b>PT:</b> Three separate times a day because the pain was really getting very bad.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  You can still do that at bedtime and the other advantage for that was just that the Neurontin is more sedative so dosing it primarily at bedtime can help you with your nights, it can work with the Restoril and all too.  So yeah, maximizing your Cymbalta is one option.  With the Neurontin, I mean the 300 once a day is a pretty low dose and actually that can go higher at some point too.  My suggestion though is that we just stick with the Cymbalta because it's not going to make you as fatigued.  The way you increase Neurontin is you take, like for example, the other alternative would be 100 three times a day to 300 three times a day, you know, then it can go up to 600 three times a day.  Usually when you're taking that during the day, it can make you very tired so that's why is suggest you move it all to bedtime, it's just 300 so it's not a high dose but my suggestion is that we just go with the Cymbalta and maximize that first.  You still have leeway that if we need to adjust the Neurontin, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] can do that as well but not until you see how you do with the increase in Cymbalta.  Who knows, if you do really well with the Cymbalta maybe we can stop the Neurontin.
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking so much medication, I feel like a chemical factory.
<b>DR:</b> We want to try to keep it as simple as possible, so we'll just take what you were already working with and get that up to a higher dose to help with the pain, so 60 is good for depression, 120 is better for pain.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Sure, I'll try anything.
<b>DR:</b> You need a prescription for that.  Do you need other prescriptions today?
<b>PT:</b> No because I have refills on them.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I think I put some refills on all the others but let me give you a prescription for the increase in the Cymbalta so you don't run out.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
