IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR of the
house, what do you see? It depends what you look at. To be
sure, this is a kitchen you are walking into. It has the paraphernalia
of such a place, in its own way. It's quiet right now,
its inhabitants have left you to see it as you choose. An odd
task, you might say, just to describe the room. How much
can be told this way?


Perhaps you are someone who has already stroked the
flaking green paint of the splashboard with a surreptitious
toe before opening the front door. If you are, then maybe
you notice the paintwork as you enter the room, can tell it
was done in a rush, and not by professionals. You spot the

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As you walk the length of the room, you notice the old
plaster on the walls with its cracks and bulges and guess that
the cost of the new was reckoned with. Your single glance
takes in the spaces where the cupboards, not yet made, will go
one day, filled now with a child's trolley, a basket of vegetables,
the cat's dish. You figure out quickly that this one room
used to be two, and not that long ago, from the lay of the joists
across the length of the kitchen. There is the old door, now
a windowseat. The borrowed light set in the opposite wall
is a canny device to brighten the long, low-ceilinged room.
And so you go on, estimating, calculating the shape of things
that were.


Open the door again and what do you see? This time
your eye is caught by the cobwebs clutching the corners of
the room and the shiny dry streams made across the floor beside
the window, where the snails come out at night to play.
Catching your foot on the cat basket pushed close to the Aga
stove, you interrupt the meditations of half a dozen silverfish
and they shiver their way out of sight, hack into another
darkness. There are bread crumbs on the table beside the
Aga, still soft when you lick a finger for them. And a heap of
books, all sorts, and newspapers. In the sink, one of those old,

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It seems that someone must cook in this room, though
nothing is fitted to anything else. There is a pantry, for
heaven's sake, and a high shelf with pots and pans, quite visible.
An old-fashioned set of scales and kitchen implements
hangs upon the wall. It's like hanging your underwear out
in public, this display of knives and peelers, whisk and funnel,
grater, fish knife, palette knife, and ladle. Why everything
hasn't been neatly fitted, tidied away, you can't imagine. And
the clock on the wall has stopped. It is no longer a minute
before twelve.


You weigh up the washroom, visible through the borrowed
light. What kind of woman runs this house? All the
apparatus of the well-ordered life is there, ready to sweep
and scrub, wash and chasten the dirt and dust of the old cottage.
Perhaps there's no reason to doubt that this house is a
safe one, if too dusty for your taste and showing off just
those things you like to keep behind closed doors.


Open the door once more and what do you see? Now
you are someone who wanders with a different eye. The walls
of this long room are yellow, a paler yellow than the soft stone
of the outside wall. And the doors are all green. There are
small finger marks low down on the paintwork as though
some tiny person has caught their balance on their way
through the room. Bottles of oil on the windowsill — olive,

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A door on one side of the sink opens to a pantry and its
stacked delights. A stretch of marble at one end, cheeses easing
on its cool caress. Beneath, a rack of wine and other fillips
to the spirits. And before you is an array of spices, dried
herbs, pastes and purées, rice, pasta, flours, and flavorings.
Things pickled, dried, and preserved every which way. Little
respect paid to the orthodoxy of any national palate, here are
the rudiments of many feasts. Like Aladdin caught unawares,
you catch your breath in this cave of delights. But no genie
is at home to hear your wish.


Looking down the length of the room, your eye is caught
by the pictures at the far end. There is a woodcut of owl and
pussycat, the words of the bong tree dancing round about, and
dedicated to Eliza, whoever she might be, and another only
inches high that looks from afar to be of the nativity: fine-chiseled
silhouettes with three kings in tiny flight. Two larger
frames hold satirical prints — plump and bustled figures, unsightly
even from a distance. You walk toward them, guessing
already at the ancient cartoonist. Pass the dresser stacked with
plates and cups all colors and sizes, old and new. A table, newspapers
and books piled at one end. A high chair, painted red,
stands in one corner. Beside it a push-me-pull-you trike, so
close to the ground it's hard to imagine legs small enough to
sit astraddle.

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Postcards rest in each pane of the borrowed light, two
lines of six. They make an eclectic picture gallery. Turn a
card and there, an unknown script dances a figure round
your absent host. Read each one, the dip and flutter of different
inks, and overhear the cadence of twelve different
conversations, each one started before and played out beyond
the card. Then your attention is caught off balance. A
photograph, dated on the back. Man, woman, and small
child grouped against the pitch of beach. The sea is one
blue, and the sky another, as though backlit by the dropping
sun. They stand, looking bold before the elements, hands
clasped around bucket, spade, and one another. The young
woman's dungarees are taut yellow over the swell of her
stomach. "Her time must be near," you think, "this woman
with another baby in her belly."


Now I will recall a night just over four and a half years earlier.
It's February and two people arrive at the same cottage.
Hugh looks younger than his years and I look younger again.
We laugh as rain pours and thunder shudders, running out
and in to unpack a heaped car. The cottage is about to
become our home. Exhilaration and apprehension mix on
Hugh's face. Walking round the empty rooms my eagerness
rises, so keen am I to inhabit this place.


It smells of someone else. The rhinoceros-like woman
we bought it from. She lived here for thirty years and
though she has taken everything else away, she has left her
odor. It inhabits the curtains and carpets and tatty kitchen

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The February before, our plan was quite different. We
would move to London and live in some distant part of the
metropolis, hemmed into some small place by all Hugh's
books. Hugh was to find another academic job down there
and I, well, I don't know. No more studying. Finish my M.A.
and then, perhaps, try for something in publishing, or the
media. Hugh drew a little sketch: two cartoon figures, one
him and one me, and around them four buildings. Terraced
house, London basement flat, Edwardian semi-detached
and, least likely of all, a cottage with roses growing. Given
the improbability of our love affair, perhaps we should have
known we'd get the roses (though we had to plant them
ourselves).


Lecturer meets student — that's a cliché. Gay man in his
mid-thirties meets twenty-year-old fundamentalist Christian
woman — not such an obvious alliance. But we fell in love
and, once we got over our surprise, fell into bed. We did that
in a time-honored way. Together for an evening in London,
I missed the last subway home one night. Hugh was staying
in a friend's apartment. So she found me something to wear
and set up separate beds that night. When she discovered
only one was rumpled, she was outraged. We'd not told her
how things lay. And then she prophesied, to our separate
astonishment, that one day we'd be married. Nothing could
have been further from our minds that morning.

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our shared and different virginity amused us, the source
of many jokes. How could we compare notes when I had
only God to go by and Hugh such a plethora of mortal men?
I had been warned of, but not warned off, him before we
ever met. "Don't fall for him, he's charming and funny, but
he's gay."


We'd been lovers for a while when Hugh found another
name for me. He called me "Finn." The name held me. Since
early childhood I'd always wanted a name that didn't declare
my sex. It seems something of a paradox that this person, who
first discovered and then celebrated my body as a woman's
body, should also find a name for me that articulated my sexual
equivocation.


Once I had fallen, I discovered I was ruthless in love. No
matter that we were years apart, no matter that he was living
with a man and they'd been ten years together. I didn't
fear, as others do, that he would never leave his other life,
nor did I care for a second that gay friends disapproved of
his defection. His close friends were not surprised.


And what of my religion? My fall from one kind of grace
seemed as natural to me as Hugh's from another. My disaffection
had been a long time coming. Hugh offered me a
crown for it — more than it was worth. The only sadness was
to lose my friends. All went. One love affair died, with God,
and another was born, not from its ashes but despite them.
And in the pleasure of it I didn't stop to think for long about
what kind of strange exchange I'd made.


One day, not long after he drew the cartoon, Hugh
read me a poem in bed. He began, "Although it is a cold
evening, / down by one of the fishhouses / an old man sits

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So we never moved to London, but lived a while longer
in borrowed spaces. Hugh taught students in the same university
as before and I returned to write about my poet. And
soon we chose the cottage, roses, thorns, and all, in which to
shape a life.


This cottage was divided in two. Two different houses, two
front doors, separated by a wall a meter thick. One half we
lived in and the other stayed empty. That empty half still had
a rusting copper, smelly toilet, and dirty mustard-colored
range not old enough for charm. The walls were pasted with
paper stuck vertiginously, at odd angles to floor and ceiling.
Old designs, floral, animal, even brick, one fusty layer upon
another. Scratch the surface with a fingernail, and beneath the
sloughing zigzags you might find an ancient puppy, or violets
under bricks that never should have eluded decay till now. It
was disconcerting to gaze at the walls too long. Ceilings of old
limewash showered an ancient charm on this side. Beneath
them, the empty rooms became a repository, a place to hold
books and junk and dark.


Friends visited and were, between themselves, a little
daunted. Of course, our enthusiasm lent enchantment. But if
it was a dream cottage, then the dreams were firmly in the
heads of its two inhabitants. The place might have been picturesque,

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The cottage had a garden, drystone-walled and full of
shrubs, conifers, and concrete. After a morning in my study
with my fingers on the keys and my head in books, I pleasured
myself with a sledgehammer and pickax. I wielded
them to a chorus of horror from old men who'd lived there
all their lives, delighting, as ever, in testing my physical
strength to the limit. Some of these onlookers, sucking decrepit
teeth in disapproval, must have welcomed the advent
of concrete to the village before I was ever born. I destroyed
grey paths and patios and razed a garage in the middle of the
garden to the ground. Where I reveled in demolition, Hugh
became a gardener, as surreptitious in his trips to buy plants
as he ever had been buying books or records. Slowly, over
the years, there grew a wild place of tangled colors, a garden
at once open and secluded, of furtive delights.


Friends came and went, families visited, we ate well, and
there was plenty of wine. We cooked with brio. I'd learned

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All in all, an admirable act of composition. Our life had
something of a fairy-tale improbability. Not necessarily to
others, but certainly to ourselves. We couldn't always believe
our luck. Of course, there was much we'd like and
didn't have. But we liked each other and the life we were
inventing.


So far I have kept a distance, talking about myself almost as
though I were not here. I've been skittering across the surface
of my life with Hugh, practicing fancy footwork. Now
I must stop picking threads and make myself inhabit that
elusive first person, tucked away so vigorously, so neatly,
somewhere behind a young woman schooled to competence,
living obscurely in an English idyll. So please, approach
the cottage once more. It is March now, fresh and
cold. This time you are walking beside me and I have another
tiny figure in my arms.


For nine months I lived with a child in my stomach. I
watched incredulously as a small, hard lump rose through

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Between the two of us, we named our comma the sandpiper,
nestled deep in my womb, a bird whose delicate, jerky
beak is always "looking for something," in Elizabeth Bishop's
phrase. The bird's feral, twitchy absorption in that shifting
territory where sand and water meet haunted both of us.
And as soon as I could feel its movements in my stomach,
our sandpiper matched its namesake in its endless shifts and
tremors.


I loved being pregnant. My hair was thicker and shinier,
my energy boundless. My appetite, too, was unbounded, except
when faced with cauliflower, green salad, pine kernels,
chicken livers, coffee, whisky (an old love), or raisins. Any of
these made me want to throw up. Wearing yellow or black
dungarees and desert boots for most of my pregnancy, I
marched round my life as though daring anything or anybody
to break my stride. There was nothing I couldn't do. I
sat at my desk, working on a thesis that would never be
ready before the baby was, resting one hand on my belly

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It seemed prudent to trade in the pickax for something
else. So I exchanged it for a voluminous green bathing suit.
Typically, I was as ambitious now as ever, working several
times a week to hone my breaststroke technique. By the time
I stopped, at about eight months, I could cover the lengths
faster than when I had begun. I used to swim at lunchtime,
usually in the company of a handful of septuagenarians.
Every now and then, some lads would get in the pool and
make great play of their talent. I loved to finesse them. First
lapping them, then rising like a small whale out of the water
and exposing my great green girth.


We decided, that summer of our discovery, it was time
to make our two cottages into one. The symbolism seems
unwieldy, but there it is. The building work began in
January, with the baby due in March. There was deep snow
on the ground for much of February and into March, the
March I have invited you to return to once more. Outside
our cottage the snow mixed with rubble to form a gray,
sludgy quagmire, inches deep. Balancing my precious burden,
I tiptoed across planks to escape. Inside, the building
dust was over all. Even the pots of fresh-made marmalade,
tribute to my stubborn, pregnant energy, were covered
with a fine film before I could lid them. When our hot
water stopped, each trip to the swimming pool became a
cleansing ritual as I rinsed the dust of the old house from
my hair.

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The more frantic my life became, the calmer and more
invigorated I was. In the turmoil my unborn child jockeyed
for position. At home all day, I was supervising the building
work and buying light fixtures, floor tiles, and so on. In between
times I attended prenatal checkups and acquired the
clothes and apparatus of babyhood. I spent long hours painting
and scraping, while still working on my thesis, leaving
paint on the word processor keys. One key remained forever
blue. I felt myself to be a Renaissance woman, my body
pregnant not only with our sandpiper, but also with my own
potential.


As our kitchen and bedroom became building sites, we
lived, cooked, and slept in the sitting room, surrounded by
furniture upended into unfamiliar shapes. Our pleasure in
cooking was equally upended as we made our meals on
two electric rings, crouched on the sitting-room floor. We
ate a lot of eggs and tortellini. Some friends, on finding
scrambled egg in the bath (where, with kettles of hot
water, we did our washing up) took pity on us. And, like
children found out making a den where they oughtn't, we
followed them meekly to a house full of hot water and devoid
of eggs.


The builders worked to a tight schedule, keen to be out
before the baby was. They knew better than we did what
such an arrival would mean. So the day before our sandpiper
was born, clad as usual in my overalls, I squatted in the cold
outside the front door, not to drop my baby, but to chip
concrete from quarry tiles. For weeks now my stomach had
been tightening in anticipation, so I gave no more thought
to its movements than to the weather.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hermione came for supper that evening. Exerting ourselves,
we cooked pasta with anchovies and broccoli on the
floor, even grating some fresh Parmesan for our guest.
Perched dubiously on what she thought was a chair, she surveyed
our domestic arrangements with astonishment. It was
hard to imagine a newborn baby swaddled in a corner of
this room.


Hugh fell fast asleep that night, and I lay beside him, uncomfortable
and awake. When at last I roused him, sure now
of what was underway, it was apologetically and feeling obscurely
responsible that this wasn't timed better. The baby
would be a week early, we joked, more its mother's than its
father's child in that. There is a photograph of me in the
bath that night. With my body foreshortened, my stomach
rises like a flat-topped mountain between my breasts and
legs. I look calm, seraphic even, though by then my stomach's
clutches were beginning to hurt.


I left a note in the kitchen for the builder: "I'm sorry I
can't finish the tiles, but I've gone to have the baby. Finn." We
drove through the night to the small cottage hospital six miles
away. First the fields, then the streets were empty. We saw no
one. Then there were the strange hours, suspended between
time, in the delivery room. Just Hugh and me. We had
brought a catholic assortment of music tapes to play, something
for every whim. Even a bizarre lapse in taste had been
accounted for, and my ancient Simon and Garfunkel tape
rooted out of a box. But I could tolerate nothing, not
Beethoven nor Bob Dylan, not Schubert nor Aretha Franklin.
Not even the sublime blandness of Paul and Art. As my labor
built, every sound and every touch felt like a haze of needle

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dressed in a short hospital nightie and no pants, I quickly
gave up the dignity of my body and all else to the grip that
tore through my middle, down into my groin, and up my
spine. Hugh's fear, that squeamishness would prevent him
being present for the birth of his child, evaporated as fast as
my decorum. He became ruthless with encouragement, urging
me on, as though, like my body, he knew in his what was
needed now. In those hours before delivery, my baby was forgotten
to me. Eclipsed in my mind for the first time in all
those months, the creature inside me seemed part of that
alien thing my body had become, not part of myself.


I was reading <i>Dombey and Son</i> during the final weeks
of my pregnancy and I took it with me to the hospital. It
sat on a side table, open at page 245 throughout. During
those seven hours I never managed to turn the page, but I
couldn't bring myself to close the book. As morning came,
I walked the room folding myself into the pain every few
minutes, though there was no position that brought any relief.
The bed in the middle of the delivery room looked like
an instrument of torture. I wouldn't go near it except to
bury my face in the mattress as though to escape. The midwife,
Fran, spoke of "good pains," not with any false cheeriness,
but because the more it hurt, the better the labor
was progressing. Her Birmingham voice was familiar to me
from my prenatal classes. She was young, funny, and without

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was when I thought I could bear the agony no longer,
that my body was going to crumple or splinter, that Fran examined
me once again, now squatting on the floor. She told
me my time of delivery was near. Suddenly my pelvis felt
as though it was being driven downward and every muscle
wanted to urge its burden out. Kneeling on the floor, I
thought I was splitting in two and needed all Fran's reassurances
that it wasn't so. As the baby's head crowned, dark,
matted hair and smears of blood, Hugh's words of encouragement
to me, his lover, his partner, turned to love murmurs
toward his child. And then Fran told me to stop. "Stop
pushing, wait, hold everything." How could I stop? Only
King Canute had ever asked for more. The baby's umbilical
cord was tight around its neck and as I held the tide, I don't
know how, Fran cut it and clamped it. It took only a moment
and it felt forever.


Minutes later our baby was born and gathered into
Hugh's arms. His shirt streaked with blood, his tiny daughter
anointed with blood and mucus, this man so frightened
of his own squeamishness saw none of it. He had eyes only
for the little creature, still curled, in his arms.


The pain stopped. Not slowly, but instantly. And for the
first time, I felt my knees go weak. Fran helped me into the
chair I had been leaning against and I held my baby. Her
eyes still tight shut and fists clenched, she nuzzled for my
breast. My body felt dispersed, as though for the time being
my arms and legs, my back and feet, had given up the ghost.

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So Eliza came into the world. I stayed in the hospital for
ten days while Hugh and an assortment of friends painted
around the clock, changing the building site I had left back
into a home for our new baby. When I walked through the
front door with Eliza that Sunday in March, it was as though
I were coming into a new house. The kitchen was as wet behind
the ears with its new paint as Eliza was in her new life.
Yet so far this was simply the life I lived, with my baby and
a beautiful yellow room.


Eliza was voracious from the first and as incontinent in
her diapers as she would later become in her speech. Even
when tiny and subject absolutely to the dictates of others,
she managed to display that endless, eager, twitchy curiosity
that means she is rarely still. Feeding from me, her eyes
would rest, holding mine, but her hands and feet were in
constant dance. I felt at ease in this new self. Motherhood
became me.


Somehow my life as a mother and my life as a student
finishing her Ph.D. managed to make way for one another.
As soon as Eliza went to sleep during the day, I exchanged
runny diapers and runny nipples for the more difficult fluency
of my writing. Where before it had taken me half a day
to begin as I wound my mind up slowly, now my concentration
started as I climbed the stairs to my study. While I was
in there I left the mantle of motherhood outside the door.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then, maybe an hour, maybe two hours later, with the first
waking snuffles from Eliza, I was back down the stairs before
she'd opened her eyes.


I was never short on frustrations during Eliza's first year.
But then I never have been. Even so, in February, just before
my twenty-eighth birthday, and pregnant again though
I didn't know it, I sat for the oral exam on my thesis. I came
out a doctor, though it proved one of the most dismaying
conversations I have ever had about my work. My examiners
told me at the start that I'd got the Ph.D., but then used
the rest of the exam to tell me how disappointing it was.
The thesis was divided into two halves. They ignored the
first half — a biography — and said there wasn't enough
theory in the other, the critique of Bishop's poetry. The
thesis, titled <i>One Art</i>, was partly about the synthesis we, as
critics, can invent between these different acts — of living
and of writing. So I felt they'd missed, or chosen to ignore,
the point.


Still, to be finished was a delight. A cake was made by
friends in my honor, with a sandpiper iced on top. So there
I was, an academic doctor in more than one sense. For a
moment in July I walked the boards, like my famous thespian
namesake. Six months pregnant and dressed in purple,
I crossed the stage in gown and hat and took my doctorate
in hand.


Tentatively, I wrote around a bit that summer, to see if
anyone was interested in publishing what I'd done. Some
people were willing to look and see, and I still have hundreds
of pages of my thesis beneath my desk, never quite
sent off before the baby was born.

We spent a month in Ireland, walking each day to the
beaches, Cappagh or Ballyguin. Swimming out into the cold
Atlantic, my breath was drawn like a cut from my body. I
watched the cormorants hug the water beyond me, sometimes
only the beat of their wings visible above the waves.
And the terns drop like plummets, the sea receiving them
each time with a cursory suck and froth. Then I'd turn and
face the land. At the back were mountains, their outlines
often shaved by cloud, then bog, small fields with tumbled
walls, and finally beach. Treading that freezing water stilled
the burden in my belly. Hugh and Eliza were far away and
tiny by their sandy castles. I felt calm, prepared. As much a
part of this easy, natural, unreflective rhetoric as the birds and
the bog. There is a photograph of us on our last evening
down on our favorite beach. I am wearing yellow dungarees
and a shirt borrowed against the sudden September evening
chill. I look directly into the camera, nothing to hide.


During those last months of pregnancy, my only apprehension
was for the curly-headed, bleach-haired, rotund and
willful chatterbox of a toddler Eliza had become. She knew
what was in my stomach, as well as you can when you're
only a year and a half out of it. But she seemed unconcerned
by my changing shape and unwitting of its consequences.
Though a precocious gabbler, matching either of her parents,
her sophisticated mimicry anticipated an understanding
she didn't yet have. Without thinking of my own past, I
grieved for her, that soon she would have to share her parents.
It was hard to think she could bear it.


Once again, this time in October, Hugh and I drove
through the night to the same small cottage hospital. We took

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This time around I was reading Elizabeth Bowen's <i>The
Little Girls</i> and not enjoying it. Unlike <i>Dombey and Son</i>, if I
didn't finish this during my labor, I knew I never would. It
was the kind of writing I could just about hold on to even
when the pains got bad. Strange that this was not a mark in
its favor. I paced around the delivery room, book in hand,
slapping it down when a contraction rose, picking it up
sweaty-fingered afterward. I finished it in that room, not
long before Jesse, our second daughter, appeared.


She came on a Thursday, first thing in the morning and
with a short cord, all just like her big sister, though at least this
time the cord was not around her neck. And once again I saw
Hugh, his delicate gestures, as he cradled his tiny child, minutes
old, and whispered sweet nothings to her untutored ear.
I bled after Jesse's birth. An hour after she appeared the flow
of blood increased. Sanitary towels were no more than tissue
paper beneath this deluge; both my nighties were soaked
and my bedsheets blossomed red. Finally I mentioned my
predicament to a midwife. Could I please borrow another
hospital nightie, I was terribly sorry to be such a nuisance.
Suddenly midwives surrounded the bed, blue-frocked and
solicitous. All proved to be fine, nothing hurt. But when Eliza
arrived that afternoon, no longer one and all alone, I was not
allowed to bear her weight upon me.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Unwillingly rebuffed by me, prevented for the first time
in her life from climbing onto her mother, Eliza gave her
sister a fleeting glance and took off down the hospital corridor.
Legging it up and down, from the tank of goldfish at
one end to the babies in plastic tanks at the other, she was
both exhilarated and in flight. I stayed in the hospital a
couple more days and gradually Eliza took in the new view.
She held Jesse, stroked her forehead, watched as her diaper
was changed, and stared at my breasts as I fed her. Jesse took
to the breast like a duck to water, just like Eliza. I enjoyed
feeding her, even the ache and leak as I waited for her to
wake and eat, my bosom a couple of tight-strung drums
across my chest.


Driving away from the hospital on Sunday afternoon I
was thrilled with my baby and eager to be back with my
little girl. Hugh had made a small wooden toy cot for Eliza.
We gave it to her that first night home, complete with doll
tucked up inside. She took the babies, real and plastic, in better
part, with more enthusiasm than either Hugh or I had
dared to hope. In the days afterward, when I had gone again,
taking Jesse with me, the little cot still stood in the sitting
room for her to play with, a simulacrum to remind that distressed
child and unhappy father.


A friend, Kate, was staying with us the night I returned.
She gave me a gift that still hangs in our kitchen. Made of a
dark metal, it is a votive incense burner to unfamiliar Far
Eastern gods. Decorative horses, lions, and elephants dance
attendance. If we had known, that night of my return, what
dark spirits lay in wait, maybe we'd have lit the incense in a
futile effort to appease, though who knew what.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first few days after Jesse's birth stand like a bulwark
against what was to come. For that short time I felt the
unique delight and ordinary exhaustion that were already
old familiars to me from Eliza's birth. The flowers that arrived
smelled sweet, the cards of congratulation, set out on
the dresser, spoke true. But in the space of days all that pleasure
became vicarious. It was not mine.


The woman who began that week, returning home triumphant
with her second child, was not the person there at
the end of it, or so it seemed. Where did I go to, or come from?
Was the despair I felt when Jesse was ten days old something
I had lived with unwittingly? Or something invented out of
the blue in that short hour of my baby's life? By then I no
longer wondered where my other self had gone. It had never
been. There was and could be no other life than the bleak
shadowland I now inhabited. Like the boy Augustus in
<i>Struwwelpeter</i> who wouldn't eat his soup, I was well enough on
Monday and by the following Sunday I had relinquished
everything. My mind's eye contracted, till it contained only a
loathesome vision of my own self.


On Monday I was just a little out of sorts, stuck in a
mood of unease that I couldn't shake off. Then I started to
cry, more and more often, but I didn't know why. I cried in
front of a neighbor, someone with whom I'd only ever been
banally cheerful. If Hugh asked me how I was, I wept and
had no words. There was no question of parading my new
baby in the village, as mothers are wont to do. I wanted to
see no one. My mother reassured me on the phone that this
was normal after childbirth, maybe thinking of the weepiness
people call the "baby blues." I couldn't make her understand,

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On Wednesday Hugh dressed Eliza for a short walk,
while I bathed Jesse in the bathroom upstairs. As I heard the
front door open, I screamed and screamed, my heart racing
with terror at being left alone. Hugh came running, knowing
something catastrophic had happened. He had never heard
a cry like it. It was the sound of terrible injury and yet I
didn't for the life of me know how or where I was injured.
He never took the walk but from then on remained within
earshot.


I wasn't depressed, I told myself. I had nothing to be depressed
about. I simply despised myself. I was making a fuss
about nothing, I was putting it on. Why couldn't I snap out
of it, pull myself together, in that terrible English phrase? I
grappled with words, reaching time and again for any understanding.
But though I knew so many, I couldn't find any
that told me what I was feeling. The midwives, who visited
each day, became worried. Hugh was <i>very</i> worried. I retreated
further, my face blank with despair. My body became
inert, heavy and burdensome. Every gesture was hard.
I no longer played with Eliza. It was harder and harder to
face her infantile exuberance when I could find no mirror
for it. I berated myself, stretched myself on the rack of guilt.
How could I deprive my own child this way, why was I refusing
to give her the smile she needed?


On Friday I asked Hugh to call the GP. I couldn't leave
the house and he visited me at home. A mild case of postpartum
depression, he said. There were two courses of action.
Either he could put me on antidepressants, but I might

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On Saturday I capitulated. The sheets and pillows, bars
and baubles of our brass bed became my prison. I could not
leave it. My existence was pared away almost to nothing, except
for the self-contempt that bruised my eye sockets and
throat, that turned my stomach and made my tongue into
some large, coarse creature in my mouth. I sat to feed Jesse,
but otherwise lay curled, motionless, in some futile effort to
still the pain. I longed for someone to take over, for someone,
somehow, to mother me. My mind writhed and shifted.
It would not be quiet though it found nothing to ease me.
Why did I feel like this and why could I not say how I felt?
If I could only pretend all was well, maybe it would be. But
I could not, or would not. I talked with Hugh, oh so lucidly,
I tried to discover why I had stopped my life. And for the
first time I could remember, it chilled my marrow to find
that words made no difference.


Hugh played with Eliza downstairs. Their noises came
up to me like shards of something I once knew about. But
I was far from there now. My love for them mixed with
hatred of myself, forming a coarse sand beneath the skin.
And I twisted on the bed I had made, unable to ease my
chafing sores.


Sleep deserted me. And, no longer able to stomach myself,
I stopped eating. There was no revulsion but I didn't

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later that night, Hugh asleep beside me, I wrote down
what I could. Perhaps because it gave me no relief, I didn't
risk this again in the months that followed. I hadn't kept a
diary for years, but found myself somehow compelled to
write, to bear witness to my own withdrawal. This is what I
set down.


<i>24th October 1992. (11 P.M.): Jesse is nearly 10
days old and I am passionately in love with her.
My feelings about myself:</i>


<i>self-dismay — longing to be mothered —
strong fear I'm making all this up — that I've lost
my reason for action — wish someone would come
in &amp; take all decisions, force my hand — wish to
be out of it all, back in hospital even. But horror
of being separated from Eliza — fear I'm losing
touch with Eliza — fear Hugh won't be able to
stand it — incomprehension — desperation —
desire for a close friend — fear I'll be unable to
give up this condition — boredom &amp; weariness at
having to think about it endlessly, never able to</i>

<i>I don't want to see anyone except Hugh,
Eliza, Jesse, &amp; the midwives</i> ...


<i>Everything anybody says feels like another
putdown</i> —


<i>What do I want? — the fact that this may all
be an hormonal imbalance is no consolation to me
— it makes no difference — nor does it make any
difference other people saying they suffered postpartum
depression or that it goes quickly — so
many tears — periods of weeping, about any thing
— and then stretches of dried-out numbness —
desire to be self-providing, but why — no appetite
— no sleep in the day — trying to trace in memory
my "back" phase &amp; whether my state of mind
was at all similar — Dr. C. said either endure it
or take antidepressants, which might mean giving
up breastfeeding. I'm not doing that. I can't make
myself eat, which is worrying because of Jesse</i>.


I didn't sleep that night. Early the following morning I
tried, once more, to explain myself.


<i>25th October (6:45 A.M.): am I just making all
this up, to punish myself perhaps? And if I am,
why? I can't stand to think of my 2 little girls</i> —

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Depression is like an amoeba, altering its
shape to take in every corner of my life; just when
you think it's left one place, it turns up in another.
— What is it that makes me, compels me, not to
eat when I know I must, for Jesse? — how can I
talk about it all so volubly with my beloved Hugh
and still be unable to eat or sleep? — it tears me
apart, that I'm going to be unable to feed my Jesse
if I continue like this, but I can't stop it</i>.


It was Sunday now, a week since I had come home. The
life I'd been so keen to return to, to bring our new baby
back to, had gone. Gone was my self-esteem, and composure
had fled. I lay shipwrecked, exhausted, on a rock of revulsion,
unable to escape myself. I wanted to abdicate responsibility.
I yearned for someone else to take over, to tend me
as I tended my tiny child.


Neither Hugh nor I knew what to do. At our wits' end,
we decided he should call the doctor once again. Though
our GP had offered me nothing, there was nowhere else to
turn. A different GP came out this time. He was gentle. He
didn't tell me what to think nor what to do. He talked with
me for some time, listening carefully as I blurted out my
shame. He didn't tell me to bear it, nor did he try to talk me
out of myself. Then he left the bedroom.

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Fiona began being weepy on Monday after discharge
[from the maternity ward] and has gradually
deteriorated over the last few days. She last ate
2 slices of bread at noon yesterday and is still
drinking. She seems to be caring for her baby very
well and continues to breast-feed</i>.


<i>She is a very articulate, intelligent lady and is
well aware that there is a problem. She had previous
eating and depressive problems in the past.
Depression and weight loss while in hospital with
an orthopedic back problem as a teenager and then
[eating problems] as a student. She felt these problems
were cured after her first pregnancy</i>.


<i>She cried the whole time I was with her and
blames herself for all the problems!</i>


This doctor left the bedroom, made several phone calls,
and spoke to Hugh. When he returned, he told me he thought
I should go back into the hospital. He'd given Hugh a letter
for the duty doctor there. At first I didn't understand and assumed
that he meant a maternity ward. Then I heard him
properly. He was talking about the Mother and Baby Unit of
a psychiatric hospital. I didn't associate my state of mind with
a psychiatric condition. Then again, I didn't know what a psychiatric
condition was. It was a horrible shock to discover I
was headed for that dour palace I'd so often passed by on the
edge of the city. Later I discovered this GP thought my mood
suicidal and that I was a risk to myself. I didn't think of myself
as so, though refusing food must be a considerable act of
aggression, against oneself as well as against others.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ten days earlier, I had gathered toothbrush, nightclothes,
baby things, and books, my stomach taut with anticipation.
Now my stomach was slack, empty, and I had a very different
bag to pack. Once again I lifted the red suitcase onto the
bed. Once again I filled it, carefully, through tears this time,
instead of contractions. Both Hugh and I wandered the
house, like characters in a play who don't know their exits or
entrances, or whether they are meant to be addressing one
another or some other person offstage. Only Eliza kept us in
check, needing food, play, and reassurance.


It was cold that Sunday in late October and rain fell
steadily out of a bright gray sky. It took perhaps twenty-five
minutes to drive to the hospital on an empty road. No one in
their right mind would venture far from home on a day like
this. There were no small owls to cheer us. We approached the
hospital on a long, straight avenue. Nobody seemed to be
there. Hugh left me in the car with the children and went in
search of a way in. I looked out at a vast Victorian building
with many windows. But far from offering any exchange between
what is outside and what is in, the windows looked
blank. No people showed at them. Surely nothing good could
happen in this place.


Eliza chattered out questions. I tried to hide the tears in
my voice as I forced out monosyllabic replies. While she was
talking of the rain and the trees, all I could think of was the
thing I couldn't tell her. That in a short while, I would stay
here and she would go. We would be separated and it was my
fault. In that car in that parking lot, no kind of anywhere, I
wanted to keen for myself and my child, or run. But all I
did was sit. Finally Hugh returned, accompanied by a young

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We pushed through a heavy door. It closed behind us
with a loud clunk, but it wasn't locked. The foyer had a telephone
booth in one corner and a bench at the back. Two hospital
signs pointed to wards, left and right. We turned right,
into the ward. The corridor was long and the ceiling was
high. There were doors off to left and right. A few people
watched our progress; none of them looked happy. The floor
was carpeted in a thin brown, the walls coated pale green. I
think there were small pictures on them, the kind you discard
from the mind at a glance. We walked past a small, glassed-in
office and into a separate set of rooms. This was the Unit,
specially built about ten years earlier.


The nursery was large, airy, and drab, seeming to sap
color. Walls were papered in brown with grotesque, doll-like
homunculi performing tasks in endlessly repeated patterns.
It had two windows — one onto the world outside and one
onto the nurses' station. The second, curtained only on the
nurses' side, was there not for light but for security. It hadn't
occurred to me that I might not be trusted with my child.
The room was furnished around the edges: four cots, each
with a mobile so high above that no baby could see it, four
drawers for clothes, four baby baths, washbasin, four low-slung
easy chairs, and two white formica tables between
them. The place looked cleared for action, though I hadn't
figured myself as one of the participants.


At home our children's bedroom was small and intimate,
with bright walls, colorful pictures, mobiles at every turn,

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The nurse brought a large plastic box of toys for Eliza
to play with. Some of them had that waiting-room aura,
with too many pieces missing quite to work. Eliza set to,
however, with frantic glee. While she played, we drank cups
of tea and talked. There was a biscuit on my saucer that I
didn't eat.


A young woman psychiatrist came to admit me. Responsive
and intelligent, she spent a long time talking with us, reassuring
us. Taking notes, listening to everything I said about
my past and present, she said she understood the weight of
our fear. Of course I was free to leave, of course everyone felt
this way about the place when they first came in. Of course
the décor was depressing. Insofar as anything persuaded me to
stay, she did.


We went to see where I would sleep. It was a gloomy
room hard by the nurses' station and out of earshot of the
nursery. Though they assured me I would be woken when
Jesse cried at night, it seemed a wanton act of cruelty to
force me to a bed so far away. On the left of the door, at
head height, the wallpaper had been torn and was hanging
in strips. It wasn't nice paper, but it looked considerably
worse when attention was drawn to it in this way. I didn't
want to know what had happened to it, as though it were a
sign from a future place too frightening to imagine. There

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Eventually we decided I might as well sleep there one
night. It was only the shadow of a decision. There was no-where
else for me to go. When Hugh walked out of the
nursery with Eliza in his arms, I thought my chest would
burst. In my mind I watched her walk that long, pale green
corridor away from me, smaller and smaller, until she was
just a tiny figure far away and then, gone. I hated myself, that
my self-contempt should touch my child.


That evening, alone in the Unit with the nurse, I talked
for hours. She brought me a plate of food at some point and
took it away untouched. I talked about my family, my father,
my writing ambitions. Tears ran from my eyes, making my
shirt collar damp. I spoke the same questions over and over,
too exhausted by now to find different ways of asking them.
Why did I feel like this? Why couldn't I stop crying? Why
was I here? Why did I feel so alone? Why had my dad died
on me? Why hadn't he wanted me close? Why did nothing
make any difference? Why did I simply want to give up? In
between the questions, I spoke lucidly, at least to myself. But
as before, this multitude of words made no difference.


Walking around the different rooms in the Unit — bedrooms,
bathroom, sitting room, laundry room, nursery — all
empty that first night, I felt an interloper. This place must
have been built for a different kind of pain. After all, when
they asked me where it hurt, I couldn't say. And my bruises
didn't show, or so I thought. I couldn't be ill. Not really. In

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't know how many days and hours I have spent in talking
about what happened to me after Jesse's birth and why,
nor how many months writing this book. Both the talking
and the writing have been vital to my recovery. They have
got me everywhere. Somebody told me that not remembering
much of this time would be a blessing. They were wrong.
I don't remember very much, partly because of my depression,
but even more because of the treatment I was about to
receive. A lot of the first year after Jesse's birth is blank in my
mind. There is nothing more I can recover and it has been
like a curse. Sometimes my account will seem disjointed, partial,
as I scratch around the thin dust of memories to evoke
that time and the months to come. By writing down what I
remember, I want to bewitch the curse and conjure a real
story out of the sharded, blanked-out nightmare. Not a telltale
story waiting to be written, but a tale uncovered from
the midst of my awful, collapsed confusion and my leaden
return to the ordinary.


In piecing together a narrative, on paper and in conversation,
of the broken-down days and months ahead, I have
come up again and again against the limits of my own
memory — and the differing sharpness of other people's.
Having composed what was on my mind, with all its gaps and
empty spaces, I have occasionally interspersed my narrative

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What I do remember, I remember sharply. But there are
none of those murky shadows of memory, those familiars
from childhood, waiting to be grasped and pulled into the
light. So, the day after I arrived, I know the day beyond the
window was bright. My sister Lucy visited with Hugh and
Eliza. Lucy took Eliza outside and they ran with the wind,
kicking and turning the leaves, making heaps and troughs in
the autumn colors. I stood inside the window, separated by
more than glass. Their play was like some language I'd once
known but long forgotten. Then they were airplanes, arms
outstretched, roaring around the hospital grass. "Why don't
we go out and join them?" Hugh's question took me by
surprise. It hadn't occurred to me to do so. No airplane
could reach the country I was in. But we went out and I put
out my arms, a poor shadow of my child, play-acting, not
playing.


Hugh brought Eliza to visit me every day and every day
I dreaded her departure. Making a virtue of necessity, she
quickly invented her own rituals, always returning to the
same toys and the same little stash of books kept beneath
Jesse's cot. Like her parents, she found it all hard to bear. She
threw many tantrums. Often the visits ended when she became
too hard to handle and maybe in this way she retained

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In those first days I tended to Jesse. I fed, cuddled, changed,
and bathed her. I sat in the Unit sitting room, unable to read or
watch television, or I hunched on my bed. Hugh and Eliza visited
every day, Hugh sometimes twice. He came to see not only
me but his tiny, precious daughter. Hiding his grief from me
(not hard at the time), he'd cradle his child, who'd been no
sooner home, no sooner with him, than spirited away, not by
elves or witches, but by her own mother, sucked into the eye
of an invisible storm. How much he missed her I never saw at
the time, my sight was so turned inward.


Occasionally I took a walk. And in between times I carried
on talking, any way I could. My furies were always with
me, taunting me ceaselessly: "You're not worth feeding. You
must starve." "But if I starve, I'll starve my baby. I can't bear
to harm her," I'd reply. "I can't bear to harm my baby. I want
above all to feed her." Which meant eating. But I wasn't
worth feeding. A horrible circle.


Then, leaving one child, the furies would turn their breath
on Eliza. "You're hurting her, she's suffering because of you.
You're clever enough, you should get yourself out of this mess.
You're not ill, you shouldn't be here." I dreaded being asked to
leave and, as these thoughts circled my skull, all I wanted was
to curl up in a corner and never come out again. I wanted my
dad, dead for eight years, absent for longer. I wanted to be
mothered. Some days my chest and head were convulsed by

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked from one room to another, one part of the day
to the next, wishing I could shrug myself out of my skin and
cease, well before midnight. When people suggested to me
that I had no good reason for being so full of self-disgust,
their words made no sense. I was torpid, a sham, and deserved
no self-respect. Most of all I was terribly alone, lost,
in a harsh and faraway place, a horrible terrain reserved for
me alone. There was nowhere to go, nothing to see, no
panorama. Though this landscape surrounded me, vast and
amorphous, I couldn't escape the awful confines of my
leaden body and downcast eye. I didn't want to live, but I
couldn't bear to die. Like the last reach of my terror, the
names of my children sounded through my skull. Again and
again I would say, beneath my breath, "Oh Eliza, Eliza, my
darling, my love, I can't do this to you. Jesse, my baby, my
tiny, gorgeous innocent, Jesse."


The nurses seemed patient, willing to listen. I thought
that perhaps with their help I could get some purchase on
the shiny walls that glassed me into this waking nightmare.
Perhaps I could hammer in crampons, sheath myself in a
rope of story that would hold good and, clinging for dear
life, haul myself from this horrid echo chamber, filled only
with the reverberations of my own thoughts. Who knows
whether anybody else could have given me the wherewithal
to make my bid for escape. But anyway, I soon realized that
the nurses were not going to help me climb. It dawned on

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. A., my psychiatrist, arrived unannounced a day or so
after my arrival. She sat down opposite me and started asking
questions. I liked her but was daunted by her. She was
intelligent, with her own kind of wit, but never before had
I met another woman on such unequal terms: severely depressed
patient meets consultant psychiatrist. It was not an
equal contest. Her self-confidence was palpable from the
first, while my self-esteem had by now entirely gone.


My first two encounters with Dr. A. took the shape in my
mind of classic interrogation, with her playing both interrogators'
roles. After the initial sympathetic touch she took a
stronger line. When she first saw me, Jesse at my breast, she
reined in her ferocity. I wasn't eating, she understood. Of
course I must eat and in the meantime I must drink high-protein
drinks that the nurses would prepare for me. Antidepressants
were a good idea and I should begin taking them.
They worked well for women suffering postpartum depression,
though unfortunately they took up to three weeks to
take effect. She thoroughly endorsed breast-feeding and the
medication was quite safe to take while doing so. In fact,
watching me made her feel a little broody. Had I any delusions?
Unusual thoughts about Jesse or anybody else? I must
understand it would take a little time for her to assess how
severe my depression was.

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So how long do mothers usually stay in the hospital? I
asked. Oh, two months would be an average stay — few are in
for less time and many for more, came the reply. I listened
aghast. It seemed impossible I would need to stay so long. The
thought of being in this building that long was like a blow to
my head. And why do you think postpartum depression happens?
I asked next. Well, as to the causes of postpartum depression,
nobody knows for sure, Dr. A. answered, as though
she were talking about the weather and not my life, and continued,
it's probably a combination of factors: a traumatic event
(the birth) triggering a reaction to past history, perhaps compounded
by drastic hormonal shifts surrounding pregnancy
and birth. And yes, do talk about yourself, it's a good idea.


It soon became clear, however, that Dr. A. didn't intend
me to talk to <i>her</i>. Her reputation was based principally upon
her skill as a prescriber of medication.


Soon after that we met again. I still hadn't eaten any solid
food. Apparently I had joked that if I were to be enticed back
to eating, the hospital food was not easily going to do the
trick. Dr. A. told me that if I didn't start eating I would have
to be sectioned and given ECT (electroconvulsive therapy).
Then I would start. It's not hard to imagine my fear. I didn't
know what sectioned meant, though I'd find out soon
enough: compulsory detainment in a hospital, against your
will if necessary. And my only knowledge of ECT was in the
haziest horror-story form.


<i>Saw Dr. A. yesterday — now feels reassured by
being told she must eat. Dr. A. mentioned ECT if
Fiona doesn't start eating</i>.



[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She asked if I had ever had an eating disorder. I said I had, that
I was bulimic for several years, though not recently. But Dr.
A. seemed to dismiss this, perhaps because I had never confessed
it to a doctor. Bulimia nourishes itself on secrecy and
few bulimics seek medical help, but I wasn't in a state of mind
to mention this.


Then she turned her attention to my fear of the hospital
itself. Now her questions felt like threats. I was frightened of
the other crazies and didn't want to go near them. I didn't
want to eat with them in the ward dining room. I didn't understand
the way they looked and their unhappiness terrified
me. I walked down the long L-shaped corridor of the main
ward, to the kitchen or the telephone, trying not to notice
anybody else's gestures, trying to pretend I wasn't there, or
they weren't. My world was awry. I couldn't bear to see other
people walking on needles, like me.


Dr. A. never gave me false scenarios, but was always alert
to the possibility of there being one in my account. She appeared
impatient with my anxiety. Like many people long
used to working in such hospitals, she seemed to have forgotten
her own feelings when she first came to work in such
a place. But for the moment, she conceded, I could continue
to bring my meals back to the sitting room in the Unit. A
record was to be kept of what I ate and I was to be weighed
regularly. Bulimics, anorexics, and babies, like the starving
and the glutted, know the logic of feeding in its most violent

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The "threat" worked and I began to eat, minimally. My
throat didn't seize up and I didn't hide in the bathroom
to vomit. Half a sandwich, a bowl of cereal, an apple, a few
mouthfuls of institutional curry if I was being watched,
none if I wasn't, and so on. And I still drank pints of milk
daily as though somehow my body would translate what the
cow gave me into what I gave Jesse. How foolish I'd been,
if eating again was really this easy.


Only a few days after my arrival, I was joined by two
other mothers, faces mundane and unhappy, not saying much
about the phantasmagoria inside the skull. Strange, that I was
one of them. Their babies seemed veterans at three months
compared to Jesse, still fresh from the womb. Cathy wore
fluffy slippers through the day and thought her baby girl had
secret powers. She didn't speak much, perhaps not liking the
sound of her own voice. She performed her life in the Unit
as though a psychiatric hospital was a familiar place to raise
a baby.


Now I shared my room with Paula, an army wife. She
had the bed beneath the flayed wallpaper. If there'd been any
jokes to be had, we might have shared them. Instead, we soon
shared strategies for excising the pain. The nurses thought we
egged each other on. She wanted to see her other two children
but at first her husband wouldn't bring them in. In his
eyes I, too, was one of the queer ones.


I liked Paula, but for a while I hated her baby. She cried
too much. That flat sound, ignored by her mother, tortured
me. As I sat feeding Jesse in the chair furthest from Caroline's

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I compare memories, how scant is my recall of this
year after Jesse's birth, when set against all I can remember
after Eliza's. It's as though someone had taken a black brush
to my memory and covered the whole surface with tarry
darkness, just by chance missing the few bits of canvas I can
still see. Though I spent two months in the hospital, I am reliant
on other people's accounts to find out much of what
happened. And if I were to try and paint a canvas of the six
months following, it would still mainly be blank. The hardest
part of this is that I don't remember my baby. I believe,
I have to believe, that I was as intensely connected to, as passionately
in love with her in her first year as I am now; that,
even when there seemed to be nothing else, I had Eliza and
I had Jesse. But I can't pin up any pictures in my mind.


I've searched my medical notes for evidence of this
thing. For evidence of my love, through it all, for my tiny
child. Once, when I talk of wanting to take a bottle of pills,
the nurse asks, do you want to take Jesse too? And I reply,
"adamantly," "No, she's too beautiful to go with me." Otherwise
all I'm recorded as doing is feeding or changing or settling
Jesse well, or less well. I can construct my closeness to
her then only by way of our relationship later, which is as
forged as any that I could imagine.


There is a game Jesse plays with a fury that Eliza never has.
It's not the game so much as her tenacity that takes both Hugh

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By day, public life in the main ward was conducted along
its L-shaped corridor. Pushing open the main ward door and
stepping on to the long main corridor, a glance to right and
left showed the kitchen and dining room. From the start, I
liked the former and loathed the latter. The cleaners were
queens of the kitchen, always cheerful, and friendly to me. On
my first morning, as I fumbled with the hot water geyser and
rummaged the different tubs looking for tea bags, I heard
them talk of the tiny arrival in the nursery. When I said she
was mine, they treated me grandly. Altogether like someone
with a new baby, not someone with a psychiatric condition.
The cleaners were set apart, they had something active to perform.
The rest of us were meant to learn acquiescence. Other

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The dining room reminded me of school. Formica-topped
tables, thick-glassed hexagonal salt and pepper shakers,
and stackable chairs. The food arrived on a great trolley,
metal tubs and vats. The lids were taken off and patients left
to cut and thrust for themselves. I usually arrived after the
others and the food I would have selected was often gone.
Who's to say how much Jubilee Pie or Latticed Tart is due
to each? The food had as little interest as I in its own flavors
and I was usually quite happy to eat, or not eat, something
in place of what was due.


When eventually I dared go in at mealtimes, I was by
turns bored and frightened by my proximity to other patients.
One man, in about his middle forties, often came to
sit at the same table. He was clever, contemptuous, and described
himself as irredeemably schizophrenic. He liked to
trump every conversation, which he could do with ease,
and seemed undismayed by his own "crazy" behavior. But
when he mentioned his son, he shook with fear at the
thought that heredity held the last card and that he might
have bequeathed him this condition. There were other regular
eating companions but I can't put faces, let alone identities,
to them.


Beyond kitchen and dining room, there were windows
to the outside on one side of the corridor, bedrooms on the
other. Then a half-glassed room I came to know as the
ward-round room and some toilets. Beyond these, a broad
staircase marked the corridor's turn. Upstairs there were

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the corner of the corridor's L were a few sagging easy
chairs, almost always occupied. When empty, their dips and
hollows roughly shadowed a human form: head, bottom, elbows,
legs. Like bloodless stigmata, the collapsed upholstery
recorded, in these pressure points, the inert pain of its absent
inhabitants. People mainly sat. Not much else was done, not
visibly. Next to this corner was the main day room. I rarely
went in there. The television was usually on and the air was
brown and stale. There were French windows at the far end
through which people sometimes tried to escape.


Around the corner was the nurses' office, half-glassed,
and a last bedroom, the one I first slept in beside the entrance
to the Mother and Baby Unit. On the door to the Unit it
was written that no one, other than mothers or nurses,
was allowed in without notifying the staff. I had a privacy
through there unimaginable on the main ward and made full
use of it. Fraternizing with other patients was regarded as a
sign of mental improvement, and severely encouraged by Dr.
A. But I've never much wanted to be good at fraternizing
and the inside of a mental hospital was not the place to
begin.


Next to the Unit nursery was a small room labeled the
Milk Kitchen. The other mothers made up their babies' bottles
of formula milk in here, and soon after I arrived I had
to do the same, but with breast milk. I was getting too tired

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a dial to regulate the degree of suction. It ran
from 0 to 10. I never needed it higher than 4, but on one
occasion I jigged it to 8 by mistake. For a moment there
were stars as my right breast nearly disappeared up the tube.
However full the bottle, Jesse drank up every ounce I could
express. She always wanted more, so often I was woken anyway
to finish off the feed. I loathed the daily pressure of the
milking-machine and petitioned against it. After a time the
machine was returned home.


My first impression of the ward was not displaced, but
confirmed by my time there. Perhaps it is just as well that
my eye was turned so far inward. I soon ceased to notice the
texture of the place.


I favored the night. Though often dopey with sedation
and sleep, I liked feeding my baby then, no one else around
(except the nurse keeping an eye). The darkness gave reprieve.
The book at bedtime, written in the margins of the
daily horror story, spoke in a melancholy but quieter voice.
After feeding Jesse, I walked the ward corridor, twilit under

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>When I visited Fiona in the hospital, I was struck
by the competent, efficient, but completely unemotional
way she handled Jesse, picking her up, feeding
her and putting her down, as one of our friends
said, "like a fork in a drawer</i>."


Paradoxically, despite my need for solitude, and though
surrounded by people in the day, I was lonely. I yearned for
Eliza's infant gestures, the hugs and wriggles, and I needed
Hugh. But when Hugh put his arms around me, I shrank.
Each time his gesture spoke of something we shared, but
that I couldn't now return or return to. I was too far away.
To hug him would betray our old intimacy. No, the comfort
I longed for was that of relative strangers. I wanted women
to put their arms around me, to hold me in even the briefest
gesture of reassurance. But the nurses never touched me, unless
it was to prevent something.


It is the job of all nurses to keep an eye on their patients,
but of nurses on an acute psychiatric ward, this is uniquely
true. I was always being watched, at first more discreetly, from
a distance, and later, oh so closely. The nurses' glances seemed
impartial and they rarely offered an opinion. But what did
they do with all they saw? They checked what I ate, glimpsed
my daily phone calls to Hugh, came to find me if I tried to
sit alone, sat in the nursery while I fed Jesse, changed her,
bathed her, held her. They wanted to know how I felt toward
her and they checked our cuddles. They never touched me

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Food eaten: One Weetabixfor breakfast &amp; a few
mouthfuls of meat and carrots for lunch. A bit of
potato for tea. Fiona has lost 4 lbs in 5 days</i>.


<i>Fiona found very upset ... Spoke about
dreams: Jesse asleep in her arms &amp; Fiona going to
put her in her cot &amp; another form of Jesse already
lying there leering up at her who wouldn't go
away. Couldn't put Jesse on top of that form, leering
&amp; looking at her strangely. Dream ended because
the real Jesse woke up. Several dreams about
her &amp; Eliza going off on their own on long journeys,
e.g. them being on a railway track, just going
along, the two of them</i>.


<i>Discussed further children. Fiona wants another
baby quickly. Advised to wait a couple of
years. I am worried about this lady and suggest a
close eye be kept over next 24 hours</i>.


If I wanted to walk outside the hospital, I had to do so
in the company of nurses or a friend. I didn't want to go
home, nor even to flee the hospital. But after a week of all
this watching I needed, more than anything, to be apart
from everyone, just for a short while. Though tormented by
my thoughts, I longed to be left alone with them.

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first walk I took from that place is the only one I remember
well. Accompanied by a nurse, I left the hospital and
for a brief time walked the city with the rest of the world.
Jesse lay in a hospital pram, wrapped in "Property Of" blankets
against the cold autumn wind. Drizzle threatened the
air. We walked the long hospital avenue, trees making what
din they could with the last of their leaves. The boys playing
football on the grass didn't watch us, but then we were a
little way away from them. When we reached the road I was
given the choice: "Which way do you want to go?" Into the
city or into the suburbs, I asked myself. So great was my fear
of meeting someone I knew, I chose the suburbs. Even so,
everyone we passed could surely see I had come from the
mental hospital.


I had thought the walk would soothe Jesse to sleep but
she was restless in the pram. Though her eyes were closed
she flailed her tiny fists, flinched her cheeks. As for me, I
breathed this outside air with relief, though it did nothing
to ease the claustrophobia in my skull. We walked beside
big roads, heavy with traffic, then eased our way on to
smaller vales and drives, houses flounced to left and right by
net curtains. At one point we walked beside the river, a
stretch I didn't know. That made me uneasy, as though the
river and I shared an unspoken alliance, one I didn't want
to acknowledge.


<i>Asked to go out for walk; we walked along the
river. Fiona told me a dream she'd had last night,
which thankfully she'd awoken from. It consisted
of two tiny, malicious children plotting to kill their</i>

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During that first week in the hospital, many of my closest
friends were far afield. The first friend to see me there,
Sara, had herself been hospitalized years before for anorexia.
Only this shared fact made her visit possible. We stood in the
middle of the nursery floor, a big, blank space, and she put
her arms around my shoulders. While I cried, she held me.
To be held was all that I wanted and more than I could bear.


<i>She sat in a chair with her knees held against her
chest. A desperate fetal position — more like a
warding off than a seeking for solace. This woman
had changed utterly in so short a time, that was
what was disconcerting</i>


<i>Jesse was asleep in the cot — scrawny and
pale under a drab blanket — I felt concerned that
Fiona would hurt her. Although she said she'd
never do that. How she could not feel Jesse was
somehow to blame</i>.


Sara gave me a present for Eliza, a book about colors and
babies. Cheerful pictures of babies dressed in stylish pink,
white, black, red, yellow, playing with immaculate toys in
pink, white, black, red, yellow, surrounded by high chairs
and toys untainted by use. Motherless and happy, they
looked like the babies in a fashion catalogue. Eliza loved the
book. It had to be read each day. But when finally I brought

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>While talking she was crouched in a corner of the
nursery, hugging Jesse. States the corner is where
she felt safe. Very tearful throughout. She feels she
is making all of this up. But realizes this cannot
be so</i>.


<i>Hostile-looking &amp; uncommunicative this evening.
Spent periods crouched on the floor in the
kitchen, nursery &amp; lounge</i>.


Two of the midwives also visited me in that first week,
both women I liked greatly. But when they sat down beside
me, I was delivered into such a storm of fracture and dismay,
they decided their presence made things worse and stopped
coming. Though I didn't know why, I wasn't surprised. I
didn't warrant their attention. In the face of their affection,
I had wept out my estrangement. Their comfort was excruciating.
Like the skin sweetness of a bitter apple, it promised
something I knew I couldn't have more than a moment's illusory
taste of.


About three days after my arrival on the ward, I was approached
by a slender woman, designer blonde and dressed in
clothes with rare labels. How had she found her way to this
place? It must be a category mistake. She sat on the sofa opposite
me and explained that she was the occupational therapist.
I wondered why she had come to see me. I didn't want
any occupation. And in a rare piece of performance art at that

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I've always subscribed to a robust theory of misery in
my own case, in which a bracing walk, good conversation,
delectable novel, or strong drink can put to rout the worst
of it. Though it's not something I believe for other people,
I take a harsher line on myself. In this I guess I was following
the family line. But now the pressure in my head was
unrelenting and I could find no ease. Eight years earlier,
when my father had died suddenly, I used to wake in the
months afterward sick to my stomach with something that
for a moment I could not recall. Once I had rubbed the
momentary stick of sleep from my eyes, I knew the feeling
to be grief and that I didn't wish it to go. This time I didn't
understand the core of grief I was carrying. Though it
shaped itself to my life like an amoeba, I couldn't grasp it.


Five days in I had a conversation with my friend Adam,
come up from London to see me and Hugh in our different
emergencies. I sat at the pillow end, Adam at the foot,
of my bed. He gave me a proof copy of the book he'd just
written, a collection of psychoanalytic essays. The slim volume
sat on my bedside table the whole of my stay, unread.
It kept a connection for me, it became a talisman for the

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I embraced you, as usual, when we met, but your
body was limp and your face seemed overcast. You
took me into your room, as if you were going to
show me something but we were momentarily deflated
at meeting in such joyless circumstances. It is
terrible to see people you love wanting to be able
to enjoy your presence, and being baffled by being
unable to. You seemed completely normal and familiar
to me, but caved in and slowed down</i>.


<i>I wanted your vigor back; it was as though I
was seeing the underside of that glow of well-being
you usually exuded, your extreme exaggeration
and extreme generosity. The gentleness of manner
you had been reduced to was almost unbearable</i>.


<i>When I left you said "Come again when you
can ... soon," and "soon" seemed like an afterthought,
a new idea</i>.


What Adam and I spoke of, I don't recall. I only know
we spoke of my father. I was haunted, during those weeks,
by two ghosts, that of my dead father and the specter of
myself when I was about Eliza's age. That was when my
parents had split up, that was when my dad left me. And
here I was, abandoning my own daughter. So maybe that is
what I talked about. Anyway, something was consolidated
in that conversation, something still alive, just out of reach
in my mind. As we ignored the paper hanging from the

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the eve of my first full week in the hospital, I had
my own Saturday night jaunt. As the light failed in the sky,
I opened one of the doors from the Unit and walked into
the grounds. Avoiding the clear expanse of grass, I kept to
the shadows. Tucking myself beneath bushes, standing under
tall trees, my eyes reached for the darkening shapes their
branches made in the gloaming. My distress seemed to inhabit
the landscape. I felt at home in these shades. I walked
slowly at first, then faster, all unobserved, relieved to be still
palpable in this world beyond my own head. Then, after half
an hour, I returned. No one had noticed my absence.


The following evening I did the same. It was warm outside.
The vast hospital building gave no sign of the teeming,
distraught life it harbored inside. I felt very much alone, possessed
by my unhappiness but relieved to be away from the
impersonal and strangely offhand scrutiny of my hospital
existence. I was looking for a crisis, though I didn't know
what. As it was, my solitary walk proved enough. It went beyond
the bounds of acceptable behavior. It was not the walk
itself, I think, but the place I was discovered in that made it
too much for them to tolerate.


A railway line runs along one side of the hospital
grounds. I was standing beside it when a nurse found me.
She came running, breathless, alarmed. "Where have you
been, what on earth do you think you're doing?" she asked.
"Why are you walking here?" I replied that I wanted to be
alone and so I'd taken myself for a walk. She thought, of

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was a coincidence that she found me near the railway
line and not beneath a tree. But I couldn't be bothered to
refute her assumptions. I was looking at the world through
a piece of gauze. Everything out there seemed indistinct and
unimportant. In my despair I was beyond caring what others
thought about me, passive in the face of the decisions
suddenly made on my behalf.


<i>Puerperal Depressive Illness. Actively suicidal.
Section 5(2). "A" observation: 1. Allocated nurse
to be within touching distance and full view at all
times. 2. While using toilet, door must not be
locked and allocated nurse to remain immediately
outside. 3. If Fiona goes missing, search ward,
grounds, inform senior nurse, duty doctor and police.
Inform relatives</i>.


I was sectioned immediately. After that, of course, I could
never be alone. Someone was there wherever I walked, close
enough to touch me with just a single step. When I went to
the toilet, I could push the door to but not shut it and I
couldn't sit comfortably with the sounds of my bowels,
knowing someone was so near at hand. I'd found seclusion
in the bathroom before, but now a nurse sat in there with
me. How could I stretch my body out beneath the water
with someone so close behind? When I went to bed, the
door remained open and just outside I could see a figure
seated on a chair, in view of my dreams.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I walked the long corridor each morning to phone
Hugh from the pay phone in the foyer (he brought me a
daily stock of coins). And at my back, or at my side, walked
somebody else. When I spoke on the phone I hunkered
down and into the wall as far as I could, turning my back,
while my minder stood scant footsteps away. Now every time
I passed a door to the outside, I wished myself away. I became
furtive, scrabbling for a little privacy, boxed between a horrible
interior, where I was sole inhabitant, and a world beyond
that wouldn't let me alone.


For a short while I was caught in the trap of good behavior.
I couldn't choose my company, never knowing from
one nursing shift to the next who I was going to have beside
me. Some of the nurses I liked and some I grew to
loathe, finding their proximity unbearable, their remarks stupid,
and the looks they gave me insidious and disapproving.
Nevertheless I felt obliged to be polite to them. After all, it
was rude to spend hours in someone's company and not
talk. When Hugh came to visit and the nurse on guard
backed off a little, I tried to describe how oppressive it was
to have to make conversation in this way. Then even this
decorum ended. The conversation seemed to be over,
though I'd never managed to have it.


I would sit on the swirly sitting-room carpet with my
back to the wall and my knees drawn up to my chin. Or else
in my bedroom I could pull my bed a little way out from the
wall and make a niche just my size on the floor. Wedged between
two easy chairs, or between the television and sofa, or
the bed and the wall, I was enclosed. If the kitchen was empty
and I could go no further, I huddled down in a corner there.

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now I began to hit my head, against the wall or bed
frame, cupboard or chair. At first it was little more than a vibration,
invisible almost, reassuring, like a hand stroking my
skull. Then it became a gentle rocking motion. "Why are
you doing that, Fiona? That isn't the way to help yourself, is
it? Please don't." Once they started questioning me, I had to
act fast before I was stopped. I shut my eyes and let myself
go. Harder and harder I brought my head against the wall's
cold cheek until all I could feel was the bruise in my skin.
"Stop it, Fiona, stop it now. Stop banging your head or I'll
have to prevent you." The nurses tried to hold their tone
calm, but only a few could keep my urgent rhythm from
their voice.


If I could find that sharp edge of physical pain before I
was stopped, then it would distract me for a moment from
the other one. My muscles clenched — arms, legs, stomach,
and neck tight — as I sought relief. And for a few precious
moments I could think of nothing but my head on the wall.
Then somebody's hands were on me, tugging at my arms,
pulling me away, holding me from it.


<i>Has been banging her head and digging fingernails
into back of her hands</i>.


<i>Found with large hairgrip which she was trying
to break in half wanting to gouge at herself.

<i>Little short-tempered with Jesse this PM, not
wanting to change her dirty diaper, wanting to
watch the news instead</i>.


Again and again I returned to the wall. I had eyes only
for my own pain. When I was held off, it made me angry. If
I became too unmanageable, I was given medication early.
Sleep was held out to me like a lollipop to a child and in the
end I popped the hated pills.


At first I was given sedatives, then after about a week,
antidepressants too. The drugs seemed beside the point, but
I took them, unwillingly. They were all quite safe to take
while breast-feeding.


<i>Jesse was a wizened dopey little creature who very
quickly developed a rash of spots from whatever
drugs she was taking in with her mother's milk
(though the hospital had assured F that the drugs
she was taking would have no effect on the baby)</i>.


When after several weeks both Jesse and I came out in
a violently itchy rash all over, I was changed to another sedative.
No one apologized and, slumped deep within my depressed
inertia, I didn't protest.


<i>Persistent truncal rash — change Chlorpromazine
to Trifluoperazine</i>.

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I made one furtive attempt not to take some pills,
putting them behind my tongue instead of swallowing
them, then throwing them away when no one was looking.
Nobody said anything to me, but the pills were replaced
by a vile-tasting liquid. I had no choice but to
swallow. It left a horrid taste and a burning sensation in my
throat that I couldn't rinse away. I promised not to be
naughty again. I pleaded for the pills to be restored and
after a few days they were. I was humiliated. Sectioned and
deeply depressed, I had no power to refuse my treatment
directly. But they should have dealt directly with me,
spoken to me like an adult and warned me rather than
treating me like a small child. The drugs made me dizzy,
dry-mouthed, and slow. Maybe they helped to prevent
me from making any serious attempts to hurt myself, I
don't know.


My strategies for self-injury were only skin deep. I never
actively tried to kill myself. All I sought was that brief rush
of the nerves that made me forget for a moment, as my body
tried to accommodate some small thorn in the flesh. So I
scratched myself with my nails till skin burns tracked along
the backs of my hands and up my arms. This pain I could
achieve with the smallest movement of my hands, hard for
the nurses to see or prevent.


<i>Fiona had stuck a diaper pin through her r. wrist.

aged fifteen; it helped take her mind off other

Soon after Adam's visit, the first burns already scabbing
above my thumbs, I asked Hugh to bring me a pair of nail
scissors. After giving them to me, he felt uneasy and told the
nurses. I had put them in my bedside drawer, a resource
stored away in case. When I was asked for them, I handed
them over. My argument was not with the nurses but with
myself and I acquiesced in most things.


Only once did I manage to iron my clothes unwatched.
When I had finished the last shirt, I had my reward. I laid the
heated metal down upon my little finger, kept it there for a
moment, and then breathed out a gasp. The burn didn't show
until the next day. When asked how I came by the angry red
blister stretching across two knuckles of the finger, I explained.
I wouldn't be able to repeat it, my minders hung too
close by then.


In the kitchen was a large urn, always full of boiling
water. This offered easy, quick fixes of pain. One course of
water over my hand was usually all I could manage, without
my attendant moving in, suspicious as to why a cup of coffee
took so long to fill. Still, in my scale of negative esteem,
the scald was worth it.


<i>Continues headbanging, scratching hands. Admits
to putting her hands under the scalding geyser in
the kitchen</i>.


"Why don't they give her ECT?" the nurses would say
outside my door, close to tears. "It always works for these
miserable mums." I didn't hear their plea, though by now
I wouldn't have cared if they'd said they were going to

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the time I was put down on the ECT schedule, Hugh,
like the nurses, could see no other place to go to. Though
he'd always been deeply suspicious of ECT and acutely aware
of the arguments against it, now he, too, found himself acquiescing
with the hospital.


Nobody explained to me what it might do to my mind.
"It isn't painful and it might disturb your short-term memory
a little," I was told. "Nothing more." This was at best
misleading. What was meant by "short-term memory"?
What I knew of that day, or the days just before or after? Or
did it refer to weeks of recollection? Did the "disturbance"
mean I would be confused, or lose my memory? Would I recover
the memories that got lost, or would the ECT mean I
didn't care about them? I have plenty of questions to ask
now. I had none then.


Maybe the hospital's recalcitrance was a form of damage
limitation. I suspect so. Nobody knows how much memory
might be lost, but if they told you this you might try to refuse
the treatment. By talking vaguely of "short-term memory
disturbance," a patient can't say they weren't warned. I wasn't
warned, however, of the devastating effect it would have on
my memory. ECT cauterized it.


<i>ECT (1) Bilateral 1 × 3 seconds. Modified Grand
Mai fit: 25 seconds</i>.


<i>Angry this morning because she wants to be
able to conquer her illness herself — said she felt
she was going to the torture clink this morning</i>.

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Twice a week, for four weeks, I was taken to a special
place and there, my hand held, an electric shock was put
through my skull and a grand mal fit induced. "Don't
worry," one nurse reassured me, "you won't do anything
funny while you're in there." As though I would worry about
what I did while unconscious, rather than about what was
done to me. From midnight the night before I had to stop
eating and drinking, in preparation for the general anaesthetic
the following morning. The food was no problem. But
I got very thirsty breastfeeding Jesse. In the small hours of the
night, my baby at my breast, I longed for a cup of tea or a
glass of water. By nine o'clock the following morning my
mouth was doubly dry, parched with thirst as well as with
dread anticipation.


Although a muscle relaxant is injected along with the
anaesthetic to control the patient's convulsions, they need to
be sure that any rogue spasm has plenty of room. So I was
instructed to wear "loose clothing." This was no difficulty
because all the clothes I wore after Jesse's birth were "loose."
I wanted to hide my body away. I had one skirt in the hospital
so dense with association that I threw it away some
time after I left, and two pairs of Hugh's old corduroy
trousers. My shirts and sweaters were large, so they could be
hitched up discreetly while breastfeeding. And my self-regard
didn't permit jewelry. I only wear jewelry when I like
myself.


When the message came, I walked the long ward corridor
with both the other mothers, also in "loose clothing,"
and our three attendant nurses. At some point we joined
forces with any others from the main ward also going to be

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Out through the heavy ward doors we went, through
the foyer with the telephone and, for a moment, out of the
hospital. Four steps across tarmac, then through a door opposite
into the main hospital building. We walked several
long corridors, turned a few corners, until we came to a set
of double doors. We had arrived. Like a chamber of horrors,
there was one set of doors for entry and another, around the
corner, for exit. To make sure that those who were about to
receive caught no sight of those just shocked.


Inside, the décor was bland and upholstered. No foam or
rubber up the walls, but carpet. We all behaved so well. The
waiting room had magazines and easy chairs. It was a cross between
a dentist's or doctor's office and an airport lounge. As
though they couldn't quite decide whether we were going to
take the flight or take the medicine. We sat in the easy chairs,
not reading the magazines, and one by one we were called,
together with our appointed nurse. I preferred going first, but
so did everyone else. The nurses tried to make it fair.


It was peculiar, going into an operating theater where
there was nothing but unhappiness to operate upon. Inside,
there was a high medical bed with a bright light above. As I
was directed to sit on it, I was smiled at reassuringly by the
people in attendance: anaesthetist, psychiatrist, and others I
think. Then I felt scared. I'm quite tall, about five foot ten,

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While my nurse held one hand, the other was taken by
the anaesthetist. With a slight, expert movement, he threaded
a needle beneath the skin between my knuckles and my
wrist and the last thing I knew was a dense pain spreading
from my hand and up my arm.


Consciousness returned in another room. The others
from the ward were on either side, muttering and groaning.
Once I was back, I got out of there as fast as I could. I'd let
them into my head when I wasn't there and I didn't want
to stay around this place. More than once I was persuaded
to wait on my bed a little longer. The headache was often
worse if you tried to get up too soon, I was told.


Sometimes I found my shoes for myself beneath the
bed, sometimes I was too dizzy to do so. Then I was ushered
by my nurse into another room. With more easy chairs and
more carpet, it was like a mirror of the first. Here we all sat
again, only this time we'd been through the chamber of
horrors. There was a little kitchen appended, from where
the nurses brought their charges cups of tea and a large
family-assortment tin of cookies.


We all sat around, strangely joined by our separate
shocks, but apart in this newest waiting room. None of the

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By now I was itching to get out of here and scarcely had
the patience to choose my cookie. Others seemed relieved by
this parody of a social ritual we were seated in and took their
time choosing between the pink wafer and the vanilla.


As far as I remember, I never talked to the other mothers
in the Unit about the ECT. We didn't exchange stories the
way people do with other traumas, like death, childbirth, or
operations — on the heart, or knee, or varicose veins. ECT
was not a shared experience. Of course it might simply be
that the conversations have gone, because once those electrodes
had been placed on my temples, my memory was shot
to pieces. So I don't know whether they, too, lost their way
afterward.


<i>Complained of forgetfulness and didn't really know
what she was supposed to be doing</i> ...


<i>Very confused and forgetful throughout day</i>.


In the immediate fallout I couldn't even find my way
around the ward. Hugh had to show me the way to the
bathroom one day. Arriving on another, he found me frustrated
in my bedroom because there was nowhere else I

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Doesn't like having ECT, finds memory loss a bit
disconcerting. Still hates herself and doesn't feel
any different than when she came in</i>.


Once he saw what drastic sweeps the ECT made, Hugh
started a daily diary for me. It meant that I knew who was
coming in to see me that day and the next, or that there was
an ECT session or a ward round tomorrow. But even more
importantly it told me what had happened the previous day.
So I could at least read that Hermione, or my mother, Kate,
Tim, or Michael had been to see me, though I could find
nothing in my head with which to remember their visit.
Conversations were lost almost before I'd finished them.
Even Hugh and Eliza's daily visits are absent, a litany of
blanks in my mind. I needed them, but I can't remember
them. My days had disappeared, never to return.


<i>Hugh had described to me with clarity, pity, and horror
how she was, what had happened, and had told
me — for instance — that he'd come in to the hospital
to find her being wrestled to the ground by two
nurses as she was going berserk and trying to hurt
herself. Nothing he'd told me, however, prepared</i>

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I persisted in trying to read during all this. I tried and
failed, repeatedly, to take in Michael Ondaatje's novel, The
English Patient. It was a joke, picking up a detective novel
and reading the same page again and again because I never
could remember who had killed whom from one day to the
next. I even tried Adam's essays on psychoanalysis (that treatise
on the art of forgetting), but I could hold nothing in my
shaken mind.


Recollection is always shaped by forgetting. It would be
impossible to form memories if, like Luria's mnemonist, we
could not forget. This man, who made his living with his
prodigious memory, was incapacitated by all he could remember.
He couldn't get rid of, assimilate, or interpret the
clutter in his mind. But, unlike the mnemonist, with our capacity
to forget and to remember we are able to make up a
narrative of our life, to connect the present moment with

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The loss inflicted on me by ECT went far beyond ordinary
forgetting. As though suffering from a form of aphasia,
I lost the language of recollection, the capacity to give narrative
shape or continuity to my life. I felt robbed of my autonomy,
reliant on other people for the material with which
to shape any account. So Hugh might come to visit me in
the evening and I would ask him whom I'd seen that day
and what I'd done. But once he'd told me, I was still none
the wiser. Sometimes I'd feel the faintest echo of recognition
but that would be all. There was nothing there with
which I could shape my thoughts. I had no way of making
sense of my condition.


If only ECT brought its subjects out in a virulent rash, or
made their hair fall out. Maybe then the doctors would take
its effects more seriously. As it is, most people receive the
same kind of brush-off as I did. Queries are not regarded as
legitimate doubts about the nature and side effects of the
treatment, but dismissed as the anxious product of the person's
depression. All the more reason to get the electrodes on.
When I questioned anybody about the possible longer-term
effects of ECT on my memory, I was told it would have none.
Yet it left a horrible brand on my mind and memory for another
year and a half, maybe more.


Two weeks in, the first shock of ECT ringing in my skull,
continuity went. What I have left are mostly incidental

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My life in the hospital continued in the same way as before,
because friends and medical notes tell me so. But to my
mind, I became a cipher of my old self. Almost all I have are
occasional voiceless images, so indistinct that I'm not even
sure whether they're memories at all, of daily life: sitting on
my bed with a friend, bathing Jesse in the hospital nursery,
watching Eliza play in the Unit sitting room, eating food in
the dining room.


I didn't feel better after ECT. But at some point I did stop
trying to hurt myself, more or less. And at another I no
longer curled up as much. Now I was allowed out of the
hospital with Hugh, or a friend, as bodyguard. I remember
the first of these sorties. One Sunday in late November, a
month after my arrival, I walked into the city to have a pizza
with Hugh, Eliza, and three friends. As we crossed a bridge

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The things I know I remember are easily described: occupational
therapy, the weekly ward round, a Christmas trip
out for lunch. Although I escaped it for a while, I was advised
in no uncertain terms to go to some kind of occupational
therapy. My recovery would be assessed partly by my
capacity to manage it. Apparently it would mark some return
to health if I could spend a morning with strangers I had no
interest in, engaged in pointless activities. Never mind that
the last thing I wanted to be was sociable, especially on these
terms. Nevertheless, in the interests of my own escape, I
made the journey down different hospital corridors and was
dutifully occupied. Like everyone else, I made a three-legged
stool, sticking the legs into the predrilled holes. My only
autonomous gesture was to paint it red (varnish was the
norm). I gave it to Eliza. It was badly-weighted and constantly
tipped her off. Later, we mended it a few times until,

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The person in charge of the craft room looked like a
burly PE instructor. He was a kind man in his fifties, uncoercive
and, as far as he was able, encouraging to the people
suffered to come to him. With his support I made the beginnings
of bookends in the shape of elephants for Eliza and
Jesse. After drawing the design with Hugh, I cut them out
of plywood with a fretsaw. Then I sanded, undercoated, and
glossed them. Finally, at home, we painted on faces and tails.
Where the stool was underweighted and precarious, these
plywood creatures were loaded. They carried so much hope
on their sturdy elephant backs. We knew the funny side to
all this, but couldn't afford to catch one another's eye.


I went to a couple of cookery sessions in the "kitchen"
along the same hospital corridor, to fill up my occupational
therapy tariff. It was December and mince pies were being
made. Nearly all the others were middle-aged men and the
session was pitched for all of them. I was told how to weigh
out flour and how to grease pans. Even in my depression I
thought it hilarious that my cooking ability had come to
this. I, who had cooked feasts for years with my mother in
her catering business, I who cooked delicious food at home
with Hugh, here I was, standing meekly and dutifully
wrapped in an apron, while someone explained to me how
to glaze pastry with a brush. But I submitted graciously to
the instructor's advice and took my little batch of mince pies

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Wednesday mornings always had a particular, tight atmosphere
in the Unit because this was the day you knew you'd
meet the doctor, this was the day of the ward round. The
nursing staff seemed as intimidated by the prospect as the patients.
We'd sit waiting on our beds as the hour approached,
each of us nervous, though you might wonder, what could be
more alarming than what we were already living with? As
with the ECT, each wanted to be first. The order would be decided
upon elsewhere and then for each of us there would be
the summons and the walk, with a nurse, along the main ward
corridor to the room with the wall of frosted glass.


Each time I made the walk I'd feel a blush rise. Though
I was already in a psychiatric hospital, this visit to the doctor
signaled still further failure to shape my own life.


Less than a minute later we'd arrive at the glass room.
The nurse would knock while I'd look through at the fuzzy
head shapes that awaited me, as though by seeing them first
I could steal a march on my medical interrogators. At other
times, walking to the kitchen or the pay phone, I'd see heads
through the glass and hear the lowered cadences of voices.
So I knew you couldn't hear the words from the wrong side
of the glass and I knew you couldn't make out the faces
through the frosting. But still, when it was my turn to go in,
I felt uneasy. It was as though the room itself was designed
to remind you that nothing was fully private, nor fully visible
in this place.


A number of people raised their eyes with Dr. A. each
time I walked through the door. They were all, of course,

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt on trial here: at first I used to assume I'd been found
guilty and I took what I saw as my punishment quietly. I had
Dr. A. acting judge. She always seemed to me less interested
in finding out what I thought or felt than in having confirmed
some assessment she had already made. And in that
environment, organized around her own style of communications,
all her statements were self-confirming.


Later I was desperate to prove I was a good and upright
citizen and deserved a reward. Before Jesse was born, we had
decided to spend Christmas in Ireland with Hugh's family
and bought the plane tickets. I had joked with the travel
agent: "How can I give a name for the second child on the
tickets? It's still tucked up inside my stomach." And though,
alongside Jesse, I'd given birth to something so horrible and
unexpected, I'd never let go of my determination to make it
to Cork for Christmas. It became my life's goal and each
ward round the occasion to prove I was capable of achieving
it. After initially pooh-poohing it, then keeping it as a carrot
to encourage me, Dr. A. ultimately agreed to the journey.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the end of my two months in the hospital, in preparation
for my return to the ordinary, I had made several,
graded trips home. The first were in the company of a nurse.
We drove the half-hour to the cottage in the hospital car
and ate soup and homemade bread for lunch, left out for us
by Hugh. The kitchen seemed more like a film set than the
place where I lived. If I'd tapped the walls too hard, I'd have
put my fist through this facade I called home. Next I spent
a night at home with Hugh and finally a weekend. Nothing
remains of those visits. I pursued these excursions into independence
with intransigent determination, as though to
look to either side and consider why I'd set my heart on this
trip would have been too dangerous. Given what happened
after Christmas, I think I was right.


We flew to Cork a few days before Christmas and spent
two weeks with Hugh's family. The photographs show Eliza
with a stocking on our bed, a Christmas tree and presents
being opened, Christmas dinner and a crowd around the
dining table. Hugh remembers me as a haunted, unhappy,
and elsewhere woman, around whom the family stepped
gingerly, as though on needles. About that Christmas, this is
all I know — that one sodden day I went shopping with
Michelle, my sister-in-law. The rain came down outside and
that's all. This goal I'd fought for so fiercely, to be released
back into my life for Christmas, has shrunk to nothing and
to nowhere in my mind.


<i>On the 5th January I went to meet Fiona, Hugh
and the kids off the 6:20 plane. I'd thought of a
joke, that I would pretend to he one of those official</i>

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On our way home we were met by Hermione at the airport.
As we walked out of the airport, toward her car, I noticed
that a strap on Jesse's car seat had been broken. So Hermione
relinquished the belt on her trousers as a substitute. Although
this was hooked adroitly through and under by Hugh, leaving
Jesse secure, my stomach was caught on a hard barb of anxiety.
Jesse was going to be hurt if she traveled in that seat. I finally
submitted to Hermione's reassurances because otherwise
we would never have left the airport.


For two and a half months home had formed one half
of my life's geographical dialectic, the hospital the other. I
wasn't going to return to the hospital. But I dreaded coming
home. And when it happened, and I <i>went</i> home, it was
horrible. My home was no home to me.


<i>I unlocked the green door to our cottage and
Fiona and I trooped in to the cold kitchen.
Giving myself up to my usual relief on surviving
another car journey and arriving home, I unpacked
the heaps of luggage, the travel cot, the</i>

How should I write about the next months? As a series
of slashes, or a blank space, perhaps? I can borrow other people's
recollections, but I can't find my own. To be sure I remember
a few facts, but I have no inkling as to my state of
mind. It's like trying to walk around a city you've visited long
ago, and finding only wasteland. Where there should be that
haunting, distant familiarity, there is nothing. No streets to return
to, no pavements or gutters, no hidden facades, glimpsed
as you walk by, that recall another time. The population is
gone; not even the stringy cats or waiflike dogs inhabit this
empty place. I can walk backward and forward across these
months and discover nothing. So I am reliant on other people
— on Hugh more than anyone else — to remember for
me. I have to trust him and others for the significance of my
own life during this time. So my narrative becomes sparse
now as I kick up the dust in my memory to see what remains.

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I open the door to my house that day of our return, I
see nothing. There is nothing to conjure with. Hugh tells me
that on our return from Ireland I sank once more into an abjection
terrifying for others to see. I was frightened of myself,
unable to do more than just keep my head above the suck of
despair. Now I was visited by a different psychiatric bandwagon.
My home was in a different health trust than the
Mother and Baby Unit. Since I was no longer an inpatient
there, it had nothing more to do with me. Instead I was visited
several times a week by an intelligent, sympathetic psychiatric
social worker. He would smile, but not as though he
expected me to return it. Once he arrived as I was peeling
garlic and he showed me a shortcut for removing its papery
skin. I asked him whether I could see a psychotherapist, or
psychologist, on the National Health Service. He thought it
was a good idea, but advised me to wait a while because I was
in too vulnerable a state to take the consequences right then.


My health visitor visited regularly, but I dreaded those
times when I felt I had to listen to her family problems. We
even had a local authority home-help for a short while. She
was willing to do anything and I asked her to do some ironing.
But she was too cheery and her visits became an endurance
test. She insisted that the answer to unhappiness was
to "put one's face on" and never to go out without makeup.
She seemed blithely oblivious to my ashen-faced predicament
that had gone somewhat beyond making, or masking
up. I soon decided I preferred my clothes rumpled.


The final figure in this new group was the psychiatrist.
We found him behind a red door set into a tall, Victorian
brick terrace, up a narrow flight of stairs fresh-carpeted in

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I always met my new psychiatrist, Dr. B., in the waiting
room. He was very different from Dr. A., introducing himself
in a tone of quiet apology. Dr. A. was never keen on dialogue,
and once I was off her books she would not see me
unless I was referred by my GP. She had, in practice, a narrow
account to give of postpartum depression. But she had wit,
she was intelligent, and she seemed to give her full attention.
Dr. B. seemed kind, unconcerned, and astonishingly complacent
about the dilemma of depression. He talked as though
oblivious of its horror and of how it affects one's life, implicating
itself in one's past and one's future. He believed, he
told me, that my depression was an unfortunate physiological
illness that was fortunately easily treatable with medication
and ECT.


There was nothing else for me to do, so back I went to
the shock merchants. When it came to it, I had no therapeutic
alternative but convulsions. Psychotherapy, for all my interest,
did not seem to be available on the National Health
Service. And having talked to a few psychotherapists, it seems
possible that no psychotherapist would have taken me on in
that state anyway. This time I took my shocks as an outpatient.
Though my recollection seems to be chiefly of the first
visit, twice a week for four more weeks I was from midnight,
"nil by mouth," that strange phrase used by British hospitals
to indicate that the patient must not eat or drink before the
anaesthetic is administered.


We took Eliza each time to spend the morning with
Chris, a friend in the village. Then Hugh, Jesse, and I set out

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A cheery nurse came for me and we walked down the
inevitable long, insipid green corridor. The nurse wore a
certain perfume. It's not an unpleasant one, but its smell
conjures me back to that corridor walk in a second. There
were a few others with us, like the thin girl whose hands
and arms were criss-crossed by scabs and scars in neat lines
one time, bandaged from palm to elbow another. That day,
Hugh says, all the other patients had their arms bandaged
too, as though slashing had spread through the ward like an
infection.


There was no carpeted ECT suite in this place. We waited
in a room like a classroom, with blackboard, tables, and
chairs. Leftover props from some forgotten dramatic affair
were heaped around the edge, a large, tottering cardboard
palm tree leaning from one corner into the room. Then, one
by one, we were conducted across the corridor by the cheery
nurse and straight into the ECT room. Afterward we were all
taken back to a large dining room for tea and toast. Plastic
bread and pink jam and more cheeriness. I was relieved I
could return to Hugh and my baby, that I didn't have to stay
there.


<i>It was a relief to meet her again, drinking tea in
the canteen with the other three or four patients</i>

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In these months after Christmas I know, from the diary
Hugh filled in, that people came to stay, family and friends, and
we visited others. But there are no names, places, or events in
my mind. It's empty. I know nothing of the brush and touch
of my days with Hugh, Eliza, and Jesse, not a single breakfast,
story, bathtime, tantrum, diaper change, or cuddle. I remember
none of the times Hugh held me, stopped me from flying into
pieces day after day, none of the countless meals he cooked,
none of his consolation. My gratitude has to be blind, frustrating
to me and to him.


Toward the end of February, just after I had taken my last
shock, we went out for supper twice. I can still see the greenness
of Nicole's plants and the whiteness of Joe's walls. This
whiteness spread itself in my memory, for, driving home that
night, we got stuck in a snowdrift a quarter of a mile outside
our village. We walked back through deep snow, Eliza and
Jesse wrapped inside our coats.


Early in March, Eliza had a second birthday party, but I
don't recall it. I did visit Susie, a friend about to give birth to

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After Easter Hugh began to return to his work and I to
map my daily life with the children. To survive my inner
weather I had to focus on the outer weather. Together with
Hugh, I evolved a life that I could bear living, just. I had to
become the things I'd been fleeing for months: a pragmatist
and a "manager." So for months, right into deep summer, the
scope of my demand went no further than the doorstep —
washing the kitchen floor, doing the ironing, or cooking a
meal was the goal for the day. To accomplish that one thing
was a vindication of my rediscovered, perhaps reinvented,
autonomy, even if the nature of that thing interested me not
one whit. It was a convalescence like any other, with good
and bad weeks and days.


Sometimes I couldn't manage it all and the terrible inner
weather that was always brooding just under my skin exploded.
Electrical storms, thunder and hail, or endless rain,
seemed to fill the air around me. And I would scream at the
children, throw furniture and weep. Then find myself racked
with contrition and apologize and try to compensate them
for the kind of behavior I'm terrified of receiving myself.

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Like all the other women I've talked to who despaired
after childbirth, my home in those months was no sanctuary,
but a place to be feared. So I took flight from it whenever
possible, visiting myself upon friends in every state of mind.
Though I could rarely bring myself to say much about what
had gone on, they offered me practical solace and never told
me to pull myself together. Somehow, when I was out visiting,
I was safer from visitation by my own state of mind.


I finished with Dr. B. in the spring but carried on with the
antidepressants, as advised, until the following autumn.
Summer was a boon time — I had broken the back of the
breakdown, so I thought. I'd slumped a little each time I
phased down my drugs, but only for a day or two. So stepping
lightly out of a summer, which I can't remember, into autumn,
I stopped taking the last daily pill a year after Jesse's birth. My
depression reawakened immediately, as though from some
long torpor. It wasn't the same rage of self-loathing that had
sent me into hospital a year earlier. But it was debilitating and
at times I've not known how to bear it.


I never considered resuming the pills. They would simply
have delayed the dilemma. They enabled me to survive
an impossible crisis and helped me compose myself sufficiently
to begin life again. But they had no answers for me
and they hadn't erased the questions. Like the pelican, I
started plucking the flesh from my breast once again, not to
feed my young but to feed my self-contempt. Nevertheless,
that autumn I was no longer as mesmerized by my own survival
as I had been even three months earlier. Now my natural
curiosity, squashed beneath all else for a year, began to
reassert itself.

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>When we met, she would often appear with
wounds on the back of her hands and on her forehead.
She did not refer to these and was clearly
embarrassed to have them observed. For a long
time, during my visits, her face would be collapsed
into a shroud of woe, and only very rarely would
it light up with the bright, strong, intelligent smile
I most associate with her</i>.


Jesse took her first steps when she was a year old. Her
early ventures into the pedestrian world run parallel with my
efforts to understand what might have happened to me. I
took out the questions that had run around my head for a
year and gave them some air. The psychiatric treatment had
left me with no resources with which to understand or resolve
my intermittent but frightening melancholia. I couldn't
remember much of what had gone on in the year, but I had
to construct some kind of understanding somehow. So I tried
to make an appointment with Dr. A. I wanted to ask her
questions: how did she understand postpartum depression,
what did she think ECT did, and how did the drugs work?
What was the prognosis like if I were to have another child
(something I was keen then to do soon) and how long should
I wait before doing so? I was curious to know how she would
describe the state of mind I was still suffering under. But
she refused to see me, unless referred by my GP. This was a
blow. Even though she was overworked, etc. like all doctors, I
was dismayed that she'd concede no human connection. It
wasn't that I wanted treating. I wanted to understand the
treatment.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Instead I went to see Dr. B., who saw me willingly.
Though I brandished my list of questions, I still failed to
penetrate his calm manner. When I asked him what he
knew of the effects of ECT on the patient's memory, he suggested
I should be relieved to remember so little. He saw
no reason to delay having another child. After all, I'd got
better the first time, I'd get better again. If the depression
struck again, it'd simply be a question of more drugs and
more ECT. He failed to see why ECT was disturbing. I failed
to ask him whether he'd experienced it himself, to be so
blithe. I did manage to say that having an electric shock put
through one's skull while unconscious was a distressing experience,
but I don't think he chose to think that was important.


When I asked Dr. B. to refer me to a psychologist or
psychotherapist, as I knew I had a right to, he asked me to
explain, in five minutes, exactly why I thought I needed
psychotherapy. I tried to do so, citing my father, but clearly
I would have needed a more histrionic narrative to convince
him of much. He would refer me, he said, but as I
wasn't an urgent case, it might take months for an appointment
to come through. I left in a state of fury. Dr. B. had
been nice. He'd given me as much time as I wanted. But he
refused to acknowledge that my depression had any consequences
or part in my life.


A support group met every month at the hospital. So far
I'd thrown each reminder in the trash. But one Monday
evening in early October, a year after Jesse's birth, I returned
to the place, my heart racing. As I walked the long corridor,
I was possessed by an anxiety. Like someone returning to

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The ward had been redecorated in my absence, but nothing
was changed by that. It felt as uninhabited and bleak as
when I had first walked in. I arrived slightly early and entered
the empty nursery. No depressed mothers at large, it seemed.
As I looked out of the large nursery window, I was looking at
a view I'd never seen before. Of course the ECT might have
effaced it, but I had no recollection of the small back garden
with its neat, autumnal vegetables that I now saw. At that moment
the dark patch of earth outside carried the shape of my
curiosity, suspended for nearly a year and just daring to return.


The other stories I heard there were as different from
my own as the lives of the women who told them. Some
had experienced extraordinary delusions, seeing ghouls and
goblins, monsters and angels. They remembered shaping the
world into bizarre forms, animating ordinary objects like
beds, crockery, pills, and food, or imbuing them with farfetched
profundity. Others, more like me, had been struck
with appalling self-contempt and the wish to flee their own
lives. One woman arrived in a wheelchair, her blue-bruised
and swollen legs pinned and spliced with metal because
she'd jumped off a motorway bridge a year after her son
was born.


Some had left the hospital three years previously and
one woman was just about to leave, having been hospitalized
for six months. All, except me, were still taking antidepressants.
No one felt free from their illness and all were

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

None of the nurses who organized the group was willing
to offer any opinions about the causes, treatment or recovery
from postpartum depression. They seemed unsure of
the point of the group, expecting the women to know what
it was they were coming for. Since all the women, myself included,
were in varying states of confusion, embarrassment,
and anxiety about what had happened, no one was in a position
to do this. I returned for several months out of anger
and because I needed to ask questions. Since I failed to vent
my anger, couldn't get answers to my questions, and found
my support elsewhere, eventually I stopped going.


In early November I stopped eating during the day. I just
didn't <i>want</i> to anymore. It was a conscious decision, but not
one I could explain. Jesse and I had just quit breast-feeding, so
my body was my own again. I could starve myself without depriving
my child. My abstinence was a dry passion I pursued
with ferocity. Other people's anxiety only fed my resolve.


As long as I fed my children, I fasted. I turned my stomach
from breakfast, lunch, and tea, allowing myself not so
much as an apple or a dry piece of bread. It's exhausting,
fueling a protest with hunger. The half hour I could steal in
the day, with Jesse napping and Eliza watching television,

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After two months of this I had lost roughly twenty-eight
pounds and looked too thin. I was worried that my weight
loss would prevent me from leading my life but I was powerless
to start eating. Perhaps a well-timed "threat," of sectioning
or ECT was all that was needed. I don't think so. I
needed to empty myself and this was the only way I knew
how. Not eating was a way of keeping something at bay, just.


Lunchtime was awkward, if I was eating with other
adults too. Occasionally I'd eat a couple of mouthfuls,
for the sake of appearances. It made me feel awful, self-contemptuous,
displaced into some shadowland of identity.
It wasn't long before I started making myself sick, even if I'd
eaten only a tiny amount. I couldn't bear to keep the food
inside me.


My behavior was like a body-blow to Hugh. I felt like
I'd punched him in the stomach. He didn't want to ask
friends to supper because mealtimes had become a trial, not
a feast, for him. He became worried, sometimes angry. At

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At my wits' end, my own self-starvation drove me into a
conversation I'd always promised myself I'd have when I was
very rich. I could see that getting psychotherapy on the NHS
might never happen, or not for months. And when it did, it'd
be a very limited strike operation. So I decided to go for it
privately. I'd tried the psychiatrists, the support group, my
friends, and the patience of my husband. I didn't know
where else to turn and I was getting desperate.


I was living in the world now, looking after my children,
playing with them, enjoying and being infuriated by them.
Not only could I "keep house" again, but I was determined
to resume my intellectual life. I was to edit <i>Jane Eyre</i> for a
publisher. It seemed apt that I should be working on a story
with a madwoman up in its attic. After all, I was my own
Bertha Mason, using my body as a whipping-boy for something
I couldn't bear to name. In the thick of all my competence,
I still nourished myself on hunger and the same
raw pain that had burst from me a year ago. I'd started denting
the wall again, and drawing blood with my nails from
the shocked whiteness on my hands and face.


I'd reached a cul-de-sac. I'd survived the breakdown, I
was off the drugs. But I had nothing to say for myself and
was hard-pressed to treat myself kindly. Though friends were
congratulating me on the speed of my return to ordinary

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048373-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He listened hard, sitting in a chair across from me, and
made a few compelling remarks. But he would see me a
minimum of three times a week, financially impossible to
contemplate. He recommended someone else to me and I
visited her in early December. She, too, seemed to listen hard
and make the occasional, intelligent interjection. Enough
was enough and we made a date to begin in January.


It seems appropriate that I have been paying for this psychotherapy
with money left me by my grandmother. After
all, my depression has been, in part, a result of my family history.
Now that the money is gone, we have a lodger at the
end of our long cottage. Her rent buys me my two analytic
hours. It's odd how uncomfortable people seem to be when
they find out that I drive a thirty-five-mile round trip twice
a week just to talk about myself for fifty minutes, and then
pay for it.


What I do with my grandmother's legacy can't change
what has gone on, but it's given me different stories to tell
by way of understanding. Though I still don't know what to
make of it all, I can see how my recent horror is tied up tight
to the life I am constructed within. Given how much I like
fooling about with words, it was inevitable that my next step
should be to write about it all, the life and the horror.
