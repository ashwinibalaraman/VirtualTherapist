BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> It's um, they're trying to learn what is going on in this setting.
<b>PT:</b> And this is [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, [DEIDENTIFIED].  
<b>PT:</b> Oh, [DEIDENTIFIED]. 
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you never heard of them.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, but they don't know who you are or who I am.  Yknow, they remove any identifiers, so [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, how are you?
<b>PT:</b> Fine.
<b>DR:</b> Something happen?
<b>PT:</b> No, do I look like something happened?
<b>DR:</b> You look pretty good.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] there's someone else in the room?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, its okay, I'll, I've been mostly good, a little up and down.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see what you were like when I saw you last.  I saw you [DATE], you had a few near panic social anxiety episodes, your mood was fine, some anxiety, [INAUDIBLE], your sleep and appetite were fine, no suicidology, not helpless or hopeless.  You were in reasonable remission and we kept you on Zoloft at 133 with Ambien, we kept you on 12.5 of the controlled release?
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so you were okay except for some anxiety problems.  What is happening [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I would say it's that [INAUDIBLE], recently I've been actually feeling really good but I -
<b>DR:</b> The anxiety [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, on and off but I have these moments were I feel overwhelmed by things and it doesn't make any logical sense to me.
<b>DR:</b> How frequently do you go?
<b>PT:</b> It's recently, I mean today I was actually [INAUDIBLE] but in the last week or so I haven't really had any but we went and visited my family in [DEIDENTIFIED] in April and it snowed and snowed and snowed and I'm so anxious during that whole visit, [INAUDIBLE] shoveling the whole time and part of it, I wonder actually if had to do with certain [INAUDIBLE] didn't have to do with my family.  We were staying at my sister's next door neighbors house because the woman was away and she wanted someone to be there with her dog and the dog was really sweet, real huge, like sorta a really big and anyway there was this huge hundred and some pound dog that was so sweet, but the house just seemed ready to fail and part of the reason this woman is moving is because about four years ago her husband just died suddenly and we happened to be there when it happened because it was my sister's [AGE] birthday, so I remember exactly when it was.  And there were, it's like a homage to this guy everywhere and this woman's house was dated and she's been kind of depressed.
<b>DR:</b> How old is she?
<b>PT:</b> Late [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Why did he die?
<b>PT:</b> He went to the gym, he was really athletic.  He had just played, what is that -
<b>DR:</b> Racquetball.
<b>PT:</b> Racquet thing, yeah, was tying his shoes in the locker room and -
<b>DR:</b> And so she's got his picture all over the place?
<b>PT:</b> And we were, yknow, [INAUDIBLE] I couldn't bare to be in there and it was snowing and snowing so, so we ended up staying in a guest room but I just, I felt it's overwhelming.
<b>DR:</b> Were [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] as freaked out by everything?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> You felt [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I felt her [INAUDIBLE] about things.  She's somebody who my sister belongs to yknow, these scrapbooking clubs where all the people sit around and make scrapbook with photos.  It's sorta,  I don't think guys don't do it but I think it's kind of like quilting, it's a little bit female dominated [INAUDIBLE].  And this woman had all these books, all these papers, and all his things and she had never even [INAUDIBLE] and my sister told me that she, 'cause [NAME OTHER] can't make any decisions about where to put things, so she hasn't made any.  And she spent all this money on all these and it's this huge house.
<b>DR:</b> She's a troubled woman.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and it just really, I think I'm sometimes -
<b>DR:</b> You're really effected [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I'm susceptible, yknow, what I, I have a bit of a boundary -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you know that saying.
<b>PT:</b> And being in that home really, as soon as we moved over to my sister's house at the end because this woman was coming back, I felt so much better.  It really was -
<b>DR:</b> You take on emotions that are in the air and you really feel them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've always, I've always, even when I was a kid, you know, I get that, and um, let's see, I'm aware of it enough but I can't always stop it.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well, usually people like you become therapists.  I was going to say and I just wanted to make sure, usually children of alcoholics are that way for whatever reason.  Yknow, the alcoholic is so unpredictable and inconsistent and they have to, they are very intuitive, trying, anyway -
<b>PT:</b> Figure out what somebody needs.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And supply it, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But it's affected you all these months later.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm just trying to get, if I'm talking about it, I mean it's not like I sat around talking about the whole, it talking about it the whole time, thinking about it the whole time but that was since I saw you last.
<b>DR:</b> When was this?
<b>PT:</b> In April some time.
<b>DR:</b> Where was it snowing? In [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].  When we first go there it was seventy some degrees and all the flowers were out and then it started snowing and it didn't stop for days, it was two feet deep, oppressive, in April, it was really a bummer.  And um -
<b>DR:</b> And who were you seeing, who was there?
<b>PT:</b> Well we were visiting with my step dad who lives there and my sister and here partner who lives in the house next door to this woman and my sister's son who's married and has a baby and had dinner with my step dad's grown son from their lives.
<b>DR:</b> And it was nice visit, seeing everyone?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I had dinner with my friend [NAME OTHER], that was my favorite part, just going out with [NAME OTHER] and it was snowing like crazy outside.
<b>DR:</b> How's your mood been in general?  Just kind of sweep of time?
<b>PT:</b> Overall fine, sometimes really good.  Like in the past week, I was feeling utterly high, kinda, and then this week or today even, I started feeling kinda that transition anxiety to -
<b>DR:</b> Maybe transitioning into summer?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I start rehearsals for a play on Tuesday up in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And [NAME OTHER] graduates from his middle school on Friday.  I'm really going to miss them because I liked the school so much.  However, I have good news, I think, this happened since I saw you, I'm pretty sure it must have, [NAME OTHER] got his first choice of high schools.  I don't know if you remember that we were going through all the [INAUDIBLE], the applications and the tours and all the stuff and he got his first choice.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, so he got accepted, that's great.
<b>PT:</b> And his closest friend is going also.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, that's good.  
<b>DR:</b> The transition anxiety for him, moving -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's still, he's nervous about it too, which all the kids are because we went to this orientation thing and they're telling all the kids how much work it's going to be and how hard it's going to be and how much they're going to have to really up their standards and, yknow, production and, yknow, I sat there goin, oh, God, but that was a really good move that he got the first choice and I think it's a good choice for him.
<b>DR:</b> You said you've been a little bit high over the last couple weeks?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't mean manic, I don't think I've been -
<b>DR:</b> No high energy, racing thoughts, talking too much?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.  I just felt kind of like, it was a strange sensation almost because I thought, I feel like I'm kind of floating, I just know things are going to be good and I caught notice of that.  
<b>DR:</b> It's the opposite of depression, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Positive forward looking.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Good mood, high.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but it caught my attention, yknow, it was kind of -
<b>DR:</b> So your mood was unusually high?  Like you were on drugs?
<b>PT:</b> No, not like that.  Maybe that was the wrong word because I didn't mean high like stoned or anything like that but free of strain and -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, good.
<b>PT:</b> There were other things that had happened, sometimes I have a hard time separating out what's actually happening, almost an inner, because some things have, like I have a good friend who has leukemia and she's a single mom, the father was never really in the picture, they were never married, he kinda came and went and then he died two years ago of lung cancer and my friend's daughter is [NAME OTHER]'s age, that how we knew them from when they were little [INAUDIBLE] and my friend finally had to be hospitalized and her daughter was the one that let me know and she had to get her mom to the Emergency Room on Saturday night.
<b>DR:</b> Who took care of her?
<b>PT:</b> Well, [NAME OTHER]'s daughter was staying with a friend in the [DEIDENTIFIED] but in the meantime, nobody had plans to take her up to visit her mom at the hospital and she was staying in an apartment with a family of three that, I swear, is the size of this room and this little part of the office, and so I really kinda leapt in, I wanted to, I went over and was picking [NAME OTHER] up from school in the [DEIDENTIFIED], we would go up to their apartment on [DEIDENTIFIED] to feed the three cats, get [NAME OTHER] clothes and go up to [DEIDENTIFIED] to visit my friend and then -
<b>DR:</b> Is she going to be okay?
<b>PT:</b> Well, she's home now but it was, she was in the hospital a week.  She had a 107 fever.  She has opportunistic infections that nobody knows any plans or if she has anything about what she wants to happen if she's not okay, if she's too sick or if she dies then one of the other mother's said something to her about it but she says I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> She doesn't want to deal with it.
<b>PT:</b> But my own, yknow, I've gone crazy thinking -
<b>DR:</b> Well, what choices does she have for [NAME OTHER]?  No family who could take her?
<b>PT:</b> She has one brother who is out of his mind, [NAME OTHER] does -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She hasn't seen him in fifteen years.  He's not an option.
<b>DR:</b> Forget it.
<b>PT:</b> She has a mother who lives on [DEIDENTIFIED] and is [AGE] and that is it.  The father had another family up in [DEIDENTIFIED] and he left in his will, I intentionally leave nothing to my daughter [NAME OTHER] so, yknow, and I've always identified with this girl somehow, there are ways that we just bonded and so even years ago when she was [AGE] or [AGE], she would come and get on me crying [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You've known her, her whole life?
<b>PT:</b> Since she was [AGE] and sometimes she would get on a crying jag and she'd go I know [INAUDIBLE] your dad wasn't around either, I'm glad I can talk to you and she is an unbelievably wonderful girl but she's also kind of hyper.
<b>DR:</b> Would she fit into your family if it came to that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's funny because [NAME OTHER] and I actually separately thought of that.  [NAME OTHER] asked [NAME OTHER] about it and he said no.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] doesn't like her?
<b>PT:</b> He likes her, he doesn't want to live with her.  And -
<b>DR:</b> How old is she?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE] and he's [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]. Sorry.
<b>PT:</b> It probably is, yeah.  I mean they're pals, yknow, but, yknow, I'm sure that it's awkward.
<b>DR:</b> Interesting.  How big is your place?
<b>PT:</b> Two bedrooms so we don't really have a separate -
<b>DR:</b> Interesting, well, she couldn't live in [NAME OTHER]'s room so how would you manage that?   It's a bit of a fantasy for you but if you were going to make the fantasy reality, you'd probably have to move.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Then I felt bad because, in truth, as much as I adore her, I don't really want to take on, it's a whole other life that she has that, yknow, she's going to private schools, and very athletic and very involved in, she has all these social things that are, there's a lot of baggage there and I don't know if I'm up to it but I feel bad that I feel that way.
<b>DR:</b> Your friend hasn't asked you?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.  I did get information from somebody yesterday, [DEIDENTIFIED] or something, somebody I know, her brother is dying of cancer and she brought me a thing, things for teenagers [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's hope for the best.  I mean, are you sure it's terminal?
<b>PT:</b> They basically told her she's just have to try to manage.  It's not -
<b>DR:</b> Is she in remission then?  They can't cure it.
<b>PT:</b> They can't cure it.
<b>DR:</b> They can keep her in remission, that could last -
<b>PT:</b> The problem is it's kind of like AIDS I guess in that her immune system is so compromised that if she's exposed to some kind of infection, it can become much more serious.  I mean what they couldn't figure out in the hospital was why she had, where the infection was, they did CT scans and blood tests and all kinds of different things I guess to try and they couldn't find anything -
<b>DR:</b> Couldn't localize it.
<b>PT:</b> But she was in fevers every night and couldn't shake it, yknow, and um it's a tough one.
<b>DR:</b> It is.  All right.  Well, put it on the back burner for now.  I think the one we need to put on the front burner is your friend.  You need to start poking around, just feeling out people like you and others, yknow, what the situation is.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't seem reasonable to bring her into your home at this point right?  And you're ambivalent about it.
<b>PT:</b> I care about her.  I imagine, a lot of people are [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, and you can stay in her life and be, yknow, you just don't necessarily have to be the primary caregiver.  Someone else could take her and you would see her frequently and whatever.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  That's a tough one for her.  She might not even want to come and, yknow, she seems more comfortable with like her girlfriends that, even though they're a very chaotic household but she and the girls could play, yknow, goof around and it wasn't that certain role boy and girl -
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, two kids that age going through puberty in a tiny environment, yknow, I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER] was right to ask [NAME OTHER] first.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But really it's a tough -
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] didn't hesitate.  Now, not to say that he, he's got his own, I don't blame him really.  I mean if I were 13, I don't know that I'd want somebody moving in.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], an older child with sharing your parents is - 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You got used to it.  He got used to a good thing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Spoiled rotten probably.
<b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> It's been about the same but I've had a feeling that I've been eating, very little, but I gained some weight and that kind of bummed me out because of the summer, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Exercising?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yes I am, I've been swimming.
<b>DR:</b> How's your energy level?
<b>PT:</b> Up, yeah with help.
<b>DR:</b> With the Ambien every night.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine.  Are you getting a good solid night's sleep?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And so that allows you to have an increase in energy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Self-esteem okay?
<b>PT:</b> For the most part, yeah, I think so.
<b>DR:</b> And you're excited about the summer?
<b>PT:</b> I am, I was looking forward to it.  I always feel nervous before I start -
<b>DR:</b> Now you'll be up there on your own in your place?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] will come also.
<b>DR:</b> All of you for the whole summer up there?
<b>PT:</b> Well, for five or six weeks, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What will [NAME OTHER] do?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's a little tricky because he is going to try caddying at a golf course but he doesn't know yet if he likes, if he will like it.  You have to go and train we've looked into it and they pay, there are a lot of kids around his age, I guess, but [INAUDIBLE] pay them, plus they get tips.  He might go to horseback riding camp for a bit, other than that, I don't know what he's going to do.
<b>DR:</b> The golf courses are nearby where you live?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's a five minute drive.
<b>DR:</b> And your show is for how long?
<b>PT:</b> Five weeks.
<b>DR:</b> Wow that's a long -
<b>PT:</b> It's on [DEIDENTIFIED] which I've never seen on stage so I don't know how it's going to, it seemed a little sentimental to me but I'm looking forward to it too.
<b>DR:</b> And who are you playing?
<b>PT:</b> Do you know the -
<b>DR:</b> Well, I know the movie.
<b>PT:</b> I'm playing [NAME OTHER], yknow, the daughter.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I've worked with a number of people who are going to be in the show and with the director so that'll be good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think it will be a good production?  Do you like the people?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they're good.  I don't know the person who's playing the father.  I know he's a really, really nice guy and that he was, I've seen him in the movies because he's lived in [DEIDENTIFIED] for a long time, his name is [NAME OTHER] but I'm a little nervous because he is [AGE], with all that implies, I'm a little nervous about that but, hopefully, and there's a [AGE] year old boy.
<b>DR:</b> I mean you need to be an old man to play that part but, yknow, is he a healthy [AGE]?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know. I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> All right, good, so it should be a fun summer.  And, uh, [NAME OTHER], has he had any luck?
<b>PT:</b> He's been riding his bicycle a lot.  He's getting out and exercising.
<b>DR:</b> Is he trying still, hitting the pavement, yknow, doing auditions?
<b>PT:</b> He's waiting for his agents to call.  He had an audition for [NAME OTHER] which he didn't get but he did go and he worked on it so that was good.  It seems kind of like, I mean he wants to work but he just went to his college reunion a week ago and the theater department and he had a really good time.  A lot of people were kind of, some people were still doing it, but a lot of people kind of said oh I just don't have it in me anymore to struggle.
<b>DR:</b> And what do they ease into, what kind of work do they ease into after that?
<b>PT:</b> One person is doing public relations, somebody else is teaching -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Still making [INAUDIBLE], yknow.  So it really is tough because it's been a couple of years and that's a really long time.
<b>DR:</b> It's got to be rough on you and the family, yknow.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  He's kept his spirits up reasonably well considering and he isn't drinking at all, maybe occasionally if he goes out but he doesn't buy anything to drink at home.  He's taking pretty good care of himself.  I definitely feel the strain of it, yknow, I don't know what to do about it.
<b>DR:</b> There's nothing you can do.
<b>PT:</b> I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> That's how it seems to me.  Any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Feel helpless or hopeless?
<b>PT:</b> For the most part, no, occasional.
<b>DR:</b> Your moods are cycling?  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> Well, if you don't know, then how probably no.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You would know.  I mean cycling in a big way.  It turns out when you really study people carefully, everyone's mood cycles, kind of little cycles, yknow, like the way you described in the beginning, [INAUDIBLE] maybe glide down a little bit and that's normal.  The cycles I'm concerned about are big ones.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're not having any big ones, right?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> And your anxiety is under decent control?
<b>PT:</b> I think so.  I'm just aware of it.  I think I could learn to find some ways of relaxing somehow.  I don't feel my thought process, I think that I should be doing more, I could be doing more.
<b>DR:</b> Well that's low self-esteem.
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, people feel whatever, guilt or bad, that they're just not doing enough.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you're not living up to your potential?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, or if I just sit, I feel like I shouldn't just be sitting [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Something like that, yes.  Yeah, sometimes I feel, it doesn't actually for the most part seem to have that problem.
<b>DR:</b> I guess in comparison you could say, well compared to, yknow -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I also know of people who have a much harder time relaxing than I do who really are always, always, always, pushing and I wouldn't say that's me but in my own head I -
<b>DR:</b> That's fine but that keeps you ambitious and moving forward and doing things, that's fine.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> As long as you don't feel bad about yourself, that you're worthless or not, yknow, worthy when you're not accomplishing something, that's what we don't, the Zoloft seems to be the right dose?   The one full one and then a third?
<b>PT:</b> That's what I've just been continuing to do.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, you seem fine to me.  I mean for you, remember you have the chronic mood disorder -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And you're kind of normal, right?  These are normal problems -
<b>PT:</b> Well that's the thing I -
<b>DR:</b> Normal, this is nothing, yknow, if you were really ill, we wouldn't have the luxury to chat about [NAME OTHER]'s school and, yknow, your husband not working, yknow, we'd be figuring out how to get you out of the state you're in.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What you're experiencing is totally normal life.
<b>PT:</b> It is, yknow, I mean to say this to you and this is maybe kind of along the lines of what you were saying about the cycling, I actually went for a few weeks without crying at all.  I don't think I cry a lot necessarily anyway but it actually didn't feel right, I felt like this is like cut off somehow and a couple of weeks ago, and I couldn't read a book and I love to read, a couple of weeks ago, I made myself finish a book and it was like -
<b>DR:</b> Then you cried?
<b>PT:</b> And I read three, I'm reading my third book since then and today I was crying about, I saw something in the trash that [NAME OTHER] pointed out to me, it wasn't that I was upset but it was something [NAME OTHER], a homework thing that [NAME OTHER] had I guess thrown away because he had redone it and it said master works by [NAME OTHER] and there was just something about that that just got to me and I actually feel better to be in touch with the crying, yknow, I've been like able to fill up because it was kind of bizarre.
<b>DR:</b> What changed?  That's odd that you should not be able to and then now you're able to.  What changed, did something change?
<b>PT:</b> Not that I can identify.
<b>DR:</b> You need access to your emotions in a big way in your work now so I'm glad you're back into your kind of more -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I am too.
<b>DR:</b> More robust engagement with your internal emotional -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it was kind of strange to go, you know, I wasn't completely flattened out or anything but it was still kind of an odd slightly bottled up for me.
<b>DR:</b> It may be the one little piece of depression that you had, yknow, depression is almost like migraines or seizures, they just come and then they go [INAUDIBLE] and when the brain, you know, the brain percolates along in an okay place and then boom you're in one, you know, your migraine, or your seizure, your depression, and then, yknow, you come out of it.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> The brain on medication as yours is, if that thing comes, if the [INAUDIBLE] of the depression comes it would be hard for us to see it because you're well medicated.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> But that's subtle flatness.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> May be the one little tip off that your brain might have been in a depressed state.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> Even though you were probably fine with your medicine and you weren't really sad or, yknow, sleep, appetite, concentration, self-esteem, you were in an okay place but your brain might have been in its depressed phase.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> In it's migraine or seizure or, yknow, and then it just broke and you came out of it and you're kind of back into your normal place.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it feels better, you know, even if I'm crying or -
<b>DR:</b> Right, well, crying is normal.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Crying has nothing to do with depression, you know, you're supposed to cry.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> When something is sad, yknow, sentimental, that's fine, that's fine.  So you seem fine, you seem pretty normal to me.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.  I guess I am, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, in here we're so kind of obsessed about putting you under the microscope.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> To try and figure out -
<b>PT:</b> That's true.
<b>DR:</b> But, yknow, separate from that, I think you're kind of engaged more, you really seem fine.
<b>PT:</b> I think I am, I guess I am, yknow I think I am in terms of evaluating how I've been, yknow, up and down but normal.
<b>DR:</b> You almost don't want to admit it because of, yknow, [INAUDIBLE] about it.  You've had a really good run, right?  I mean you've not had a relapse.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE], so thank God for Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Indeed.
<b>DR:</b> Let's not change your dose.
<b>PT:</b> Did you happen to read, by the way, or hear about [NAME OTHER]'s book [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>DR:</b> I read a review about it or something.  She had depression?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, part of it seems a little easy solution thing, although she encourages, part of it, she wrote it because she wanted to encourage people to get help if they need it and that she benefited from medication.
<b>DR:</b> She also wants to cash in on her status as a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I'm sure the timing is not coincidental but it's a page turner of a book.
<b>DR:</b> Is it really?  That's good, okay, maybe I'll pick it up.
<b>PT:</b> She's somebody who's, she has experienced a lot of crazy relationships -
<b>DR:</b> Maybe she was cycler maybe she's not just a depressive but -
<b>PT:</b> Maybe so.
<b>DR:</b> But a cycler.
<b>PT:</b> Well that was the first book that got me going.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I read it in a day and a half.  And I'm going whoa -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I felt really good about myself, even though I think she's terrific but it was a very interesting book to read, her relationships with [NAME OTHER] who's like really wacko.
<b>DR:</b> Is he wacko?  He's a great actor.
<b>PT:</b> I know, he is but he's really moody, he has tremendous storages of anxiety that I never I guess been addressed maybe, and then, yeah, well if you read the book, you'll see what I mean.
<b>DR:</b> I'll let you know.
<b>PT:</b> It's a good summer read.
<b>DR:</b> Well take care.  Have a nice summer.  Good luck with the show.
<b>PT:</b> Well, thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Give my best to your family.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.  I hope you have a good summer too.
<b>DR:</b> Thanks.
<b>PT:</b> Bye.
