Dr. Collier looked brown and rested when he returned
from his vacation.


After we had small-talked about vacations, I said, "Dr.
Collier, there are three things I would like to discuss with
you."


"All right," he smiled. "Let's get them off your mind.
What are they?"


"The first thing is about something the dietitian told,"
I explained.


"Yes?"


"One morning Dr. Pierce called Miss Greear about a
diet for me. She'd already heard that I needed a diet. But
she refused to give me one."


"Why?" demanded Dr. Collier.


"She said there was no use to put me on a diet, because
you had told her that you had seen me eating hunks of
butter on my toast," I said slowly. "Did you really tell
her that?"


Dr. Collier laughed heartily. He shook his head. "I
never said such a thing. ... I never thought of saying
such a thing!"

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I didn't think you did," I said. "But I had to know.
And there is another question I want to ask you, too."


He nodded.


"Does a patient have to get worse before he can get
better?"


"Heavens, no!" exclaimed Dr. Collier. "Why do you
ask a question like that?"


"Because Dr. Pierce said the patients have to get worse
before they can get better."


"No," repeated Dr. Collier emphatically, "that's what
a psychiatrist is for ... to keep the patients from getting
worse. It's like anything else. The sicker the patient gets,
the more damage is done and the less chance the patient
has of getting well."


"That's what I thought. But I wanted to be certain."
I nodded. "Now, there is one other thing I want to ask
you about. I'm almost afraid to ask you."


"What is it?"


"Dr. Pierce told me it would take years and years for
me to get out. What do you think?"


"I see no reason for it to take years and years," answered
Dr. Collier without hesitation. "But they do report
that you've been more upset during the last two weeks."


"Yes, I have, Dr. Collier. I know I have," I agreed.
"But so many things have happened—and I've had so
much pain!"


Dr. Collier shook his head impatiently. "How do you
ever expect to get out, Mrs. Davenport ... the way you've
been acting on that ward?"


I shook my head.


"Cutting your hair for hours at a time ... bawling the
attendants and nurses out for reporting you ... not sharing
the lavatories and mirrors. ..." Dr. Collier looked
exasperated.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt big as a flea.


"It's your emotional immaturity, Mrs. Davenport," Dr.
Collier said sadly.


I winced and nodded.


"You'll have to stay here until you start doing better,"
he added.


My nose itched. I rubbed it.


"What did you and Dr. Pierce talk about while I was
gone?"


"We discussed the same thing you and I had already
gone over," I answered.


"Well, about the name your husband calls you," said
Dr. Collier, "we think you should find out why you are
sensitive to it."


"It doesn't seem important, Dr. Collier," I said wearily.
"I never did care for vulgar talk. And Dad sowing so
many wild oats probably made me more conscious of such
things."


"No," he said, "we don't think that would be sufficient
reason."


Dr. Collier didn't explain who he meant by "we"
either. But again I assumed that Dr. Mutter must have
something to do with this ... otherwise why would he
have wanted to see me?


"We've decided that your sensitivity to the name is
caused by the way you feel about something else," said
Dr. Collier seriously. He had an odd expression on his
face as he continued, "It is probably in your subconscious.
You think about it until Monday. We'll discuss it again
then."


Dr. Collier walked with me to the ward.


The ward was just the same. There was still no air.
Kitty was still lying on her bed with her face covered.
Marion was still looking out of the window.

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm not spending all my time looking out of a window
just yet ... Dear God ... not yet. ...


tried to lie on my bed—but I couldn't.


Ã walked to the sun porch ... think ... and back to
the end of the corridor ... think. ...


Was there anything in your childhood that would have
any bearing on this? I searched. There was nothing.


Back and forth ... back and forth ... from one end of
the ward to the other.


Think.


Was there anything after you were grown that would
have any bearing on this? I searched. There was nothing.


Think ...


How about your married life? I searched. There was
nothing.


I began to itch. My nose itched. My ears itched. My
head itched. My body itched.


I began to scratch.


Think ... Dr. Collier said to think. I won't think ...


Back and forth ... back and forth. ... When I wasn't
fanning, I was scratching.


Mary was sprawled on a chair on the sun porch. She
was staring at the floor.


"I hope you're feeling better today, Mary."


She raised her head, slowly. The movement seemed an
effort.


"I still have my sore tongue and flip-flops," she said
dully.


"Haven't the vitamins helped your tongue?"


"They haven't given me any vitamins. But my doctor
says if I don't get better in two more weeks they'll start
giving me electric shock treatments."


Mary was staring at the floor again.


Think ... I don't want to think ... I won't


Back and forth ... back and forth. ...


On Saturday morning Kitty received the hardest blow
she could have been dealt. She received word that her
father had had a stroke.


Kitty was disconsolate. She lay on her bed and cried.
(The private bedroom was already occupied by Evelyn.)


"If my father dies, I'll die, too," she said. "He is the
only person in the world who loves me."


"Some strokes aren't very serious, Kitty," I said, patting
her hand. "This might be a slight one."


"It's serious or they wouldn't have let me know about
it." She shook her head. "And if he died, I wouldn't even
get to go to his funeral."


Tears rolled down her cheeks.


An attendant came and stood by the bed. I walked to
the sun porch ... then back to the end of the corridor.


Back and forth ... back and forth. ...

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Think ... Dr. Collier said to think.


"You have seen attractive men, Mrs. Davenport?" That
seemed to interest Dr. Pierce and Dr. Collier.


Yes, I have seen attractive men.


Think. ...


I don't want to think. Why don't you want to think?
O.K. I'll think.


The first one I thought was attractive was about sixteen
years ago. Do you ever see him now? No. I haven't
seen him for fifteen years.


Do you ever think of him? Never ... never ...
never. ...


Back and forth ... fanning and scratching. ...


Iris lay on her bed "Hello, Iris."

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Iris nodded.


Why can't she smile just once!


Think ... I don't want to think ... Why don't you
want to think? O.K. I'll think.


You have seen two attractive men since you've been
married? Yes. How about the other one? Do you ever see
him? I've seen him once in the last three or four years.
Do you ever think of him? No! Yes ... Well ... Not
often ... Maybe every three or four months. What do you
think? I don't think anything. When I think of him I
always put him quickly out of my mind. Why? Why won't
you think of him?


Back and forth ... think ... I won't think!


There was no air. I itched all over.


Evelyn and I sat alone at lunch that day. When I
looked at her, I thought of Yvonne. There was no physical
resemblance. It wasn't that—it was her coloring. She was
getting the same gray look Yvonne had the day she left
the clinic.


Food ... it looked and tasted just like Miss Greear had
heard ... food. Ug!


Impatiently I sat, waiting for Evelyn to finish eating.
It was difficult to sit still.


There was a rapping noise. Turning around, I saw
Marion standing by her chair. She was rapping on the
table for order.


"I have an announcement to make," she said in a
monotone.


Everyone became quiet.


"I'm making this announcement because I think you
should know it," she said slowly, as if groping for proper
words.


We waited expectantly.

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Dr. Pierce told me yesterday that I made a passat
him." Marion sat down.


Some of the women laughed.


Evelyn shook her head. We left the table without
speaking.


Back and forth ... think ... don't think ... think
... don't think. ...


And itch ... itch ... itch. ...


No wonder they call places like this bug houses.


I'm getting worse. Yes. You're getting worse.


What if they start giving you electric shock treatments?


Back and forth ...


Evelyn began to cry. A student nurse took her to the
bedroom in the corridor.


Back and forth.


What if they change your doctor? What if they give
you one who keeps you upset all the time?


Back and forth. ...


Alternately fanning and scratching. ...


What if they'd give you a doctor who would browbeat
you about your emotional immaturity?


Back and forth. ...


Think ... don't think ... think ... don't think!


Why don't you want to think, Eloise? Don't try" to
escape things. Why don't you want to think?


I just don't want to think about it. And I won't! I'm
not going to think!


Back and forth ... back and forth.


You might as well go to the State Hospital, Eloise.
You're getting worse.


Marion stood at the window.


"Marion," I said, "I might as well go to the State
Hospital. I'm getting worse."


She turned and faced me. On her face was written

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121810-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Why do you think you're getting worse?" she asked.


"Because I can't sit still; there seems to be no air, and
I itch all over."


"Maybe we're in Hell, Eloise, and don't know it," she
said without emotion.


Abruptly, I turned away. I walked to the ward office
and knocked. Mrs. Rand opened the door. "Yes?"


"May I have a three day notice? I want to hand mine
in."


She looked searchingly at me for a moment. "Are you
sure, Mrs. Davenport. Are you sure?"


"No. I'm not sure of anything. But I'm still going to
turn it in. If they won't let me go home, I'll go to the
State Hospital."


Mrs. Rand handed me a printed notice. I dated and
signed it, and handed it back to her.


But I didn't get out in time.
