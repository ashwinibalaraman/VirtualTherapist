BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So, you've done a lot in the last month.  
<b>PT:</b> Notice anything?
<b>DR:</b> Well, your hair looks good.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I went to the hairdresser.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> I'm looking to see - is there color, or - it's a nice color.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.  Yep.  Yep.  And, the best part was [INAUDIBLE] again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> That's his favorite, the [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> There was no anxiety or -
<b>PT:</b> No, you want to know what really happened?  I knew it was gonna happen and I thought of it all day.  I was a little hyper but, you wanna get well, you gotta do it.  You can't just keep saying I'll do it tomorrow.  Tomorrow never comes.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Well, he came, I did it and when I opened the door and I said hi to him, it was a completely different person that I thought in my head.  I said you see how you were thinking, [PATIENT NAME]?  The reality and the thought is not the same.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I was very honest with him, I said look, I'm on my computer, I'm playing a gin game.  I said you didn't need to call me.  You didn't need me, yknow, um, [NAME OTHER] paid him, and I kept calling out just to -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I was okay.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> What did you think he was gonna be like before?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, [PHYSICIAN NAME], I get these feelings, like the scare that I might hurt somebody because I was on Prozac -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have any ones in my head.  I don't have an, uh, object, I just have the thought of - I wouldn't know who the person is because, see, when you think you're gonna hurt somebody, you don't know who you're gonna hurt.  I don't wanna hurt nobody so I don't have no one - I thought he had dark hair and, um,  sometimes when you hear their voice, you picture them looking - 
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> But he was completely different.
<b>DR:</b> Totally.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So, then I said see [PATIENT NAME], the reality and the thought are different.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right, um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, that happened, and I wanted to call you right away, but I didn't.  I said now, come on [PATIENT NAME], he's your doctor you don't need to call him.  You can tell your husband, right?
<b>DR:</b> You can tell me when you come to see me -
<b>PT:</b> Right.  And I was like proud of myself because see, I did handle that right, I didn't call you.
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely.  I mean, because I think it sounds like yeah, you knew the anxiety, you knew you needed to take care of it and you did it.  You told yourself that during the process of it, you were able to assess it and kinda say oh, yknow, like, he's totally different than I thought it was.  Look how my mind [INAUDIBLE] and you had a success in that, yknow, you were able to appreciate that success and you're telling me today, which is great.
<b>PT:</b> And I wanted you to be proud of me, I guess.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then with the hairdresser, I was a little on edge.  I drove to the hairdresser and I went in and, of course, I love [INAUDIBLE] and he said oh, well it looks the same.  But my hairdresser, she loves me dearly, and she would talk to me and I'm very frank with her.  I told her I'm on the Prozac.  I said I'm adjusting to it.  I said, but I was afraid of it and she did my hair.  I didn't think about no scissors.  I didn't think oh, I got this taken off, this taken off, this taken off.  I was talking, I was socializing with the people.  I'm a social butterfly, yknow, that, right?  And, um, I got a pedicure.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I did it all.
<b>DR:</b> Very good.  When was this?
<b>PT:</b> This was on, maybe, ooh, I would say three weeks ago maybe?  And, um, now I'm gonna start to go back to the dentist, get whatever I need to get done because I stopped everything, doctor, I was just scared to be with everybody.
<b>DR:</b> It looks like you're taking care of yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Do I look good?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> Do I look [AGE]?
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely not.
<b>PT:</b> No?  I have to tell you a secret.  You promise not to tell nobody?
<b>DR:</b> Okay - no, well, they're not going to tell anybody either.
<b>PT:</b> I met a friend on the net.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> A male.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> He's [AGE].  I have his picture.  I gave him a picture of me.  We play pool, we play Canasta, we play spades.
<b>DR:</b> Over the computer.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, over the computer.  But we talk live on the phone.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, um -
<b>DR:</b> You've met people on the internet before.
<b>PT:</b> No, I have never met anyone.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I thought you communicated with people.
<b>PT:</b> I communicate through talking, but this one, he's my friend and he's adorable and, um, he's married.  Um, thirty years like me, and, uh, we play cards, we laugh and doctor, [NAME OTHER] don't understand.  [NAME OTHER] knows I talk to people, but [NAME OTHER] does not understand that - he still thinks in his mind, because I go on the net, and because I play on the net - now my friend works nights.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, I'm not with him at nighttime, like we go in rooms, we talk to people.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm with him more in the daytime, a lot stays with me.  Like three hours a day.  We talk about everything because we do it live.  We don't have to type.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And he hears my voice and I hear his voice and we speak and he like, we're friends, but he, he cares a lot about me.  [NAME OTHER] takes - well - I said should I tell the doctor, I say to him, should I tell the doctor I'm worse or better and he looks at me.  I know I'm better, but I want to see what he feels.  He doesn't realize that the net is my own thing.  I don't have to be mentally ill or have a problem to enjoy the net.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> There's a person that's taking the time to give me their time and we laugh and we do mostly everything.  We flirt with each other, yknow.
<b>DR:</b> Are you sure he's not a little jealous?  
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Does he felt threatened by the friendship that you have?
<b>PT:</b> No.  He thinks that because I don't move around enough - which I don't, but I will, that I live an unhealthy life.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well a lot of people spend a lot of time at the computer.  And I think we talked once before that, yknow, it's a good thing, I think, for you when you're feeling isolated to make connections through the internet, but that real time, live relationships have much more value to them.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Like going and meeting people and not just having a virtual friend.
<b>PT:</b> Well, guess what I'm meeting him in October.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Why in October?  So I can get through all this, um, mental stuff so I can lose more weight so I can really feel good.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> And I guess, maybe, I don't know if your husband feels this way, too, but if you are spending more time at your computer, it's more sedentary it's not as physical, so that if you, if you had some activities that were just not in front of the computer, you may be able to reach some of these other goals.  Exercise and healthy - 
<b>PT:</b> Eating? 
<b>DR:</b> Being able to get out and exercise.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I have, I have a bike that I can ride.  I started to smoke again, too.  I might as well tell ya that.  That was bad because I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay?  I shoulda - I started up again.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, now we're going through all the things that could make a healthy lifestyle.
<b>PT:</b> Right, I needed to smoke for some reason, I guess, I guess, I don't know.  Um, it does help me and I do enjoy it.  That's another thing I enjoy, but I overdo it.  I won't fight ya on that.  I don't fight with [NAME OTHER] on that.  But, like, this person that came into my life, I met him after all my problems that I had.  Um, I told him how I went to the hospital, I told him I have a fabulous doctor, I told him I was crying a lot.  I didn't say about wanting to hurt people.  I didn't wanta scare the guy, yknow what I mean?  He don't know me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, I tell him I'm on Prozac and, um, we talk every day.  He's special.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I like him.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not marrying him, we know that already.
<b>DR:</b> Right, you have a friendship.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But you're intrigued, and it's kinda fun and exciting to imagine meeting him in October.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I fix my mini all cute for him and he fixes his for me.
<b>DR:</b> But the one thing [PATIENT NAME], when you're on the computer, how many hours a day are you on the computer?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't stay - I used to just go to bed at four o'clock in the morning.  I don't do that no more, doc, I can't do that any more.  I talk to him, I'd say a couple hours, with my friend and I get off.  I get off for dinner, I straighten up, I try to help [NAME OTHER] more.  [NAME OTHER], you can never satisfy him.  That's just him.  It isn't a bad thing, he is just that way.  I knew this.  One day, I really made dinner, did everything, straightened the kitchen, did it all.  He was very happy.  The next day, my hands hurt, I didn't feel good, I didn't feel like doing the dishwasher, I left it sit.  Then I get the, then I get, oh, we don't do nothin' around here, I'm a slave, I have to do - yesterday I did somethin', but doesn't keep that.  He brings the negative part of me out more.  I don't like that because you have me in a picture frame and because I did somethin' once, you keep tellin' people I do it forever.  Um, all the things that he has learned how to cook or has done, I brought it to him.  He didn't go out to do.  He won't realize that.  Like, um, pizza.  We make homemade pizza.  He makes the dough.  Oh, you didn't do much, now he's the one - I let it go, doc, because I know he's got some emotional problems or somethin' in there, but like if he were to come to talk to you or he would talk to somebody that I wouldn't want him - he would say well, she never does nothin'.  But he won't tell you when I do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You understand what I'm sayin'?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, no, no, no, no.  That's why I ask how many hours you spend on the internet.
<b>PT:</b> Well, in the morning -
<b>DR:</b> During the day, in a twenty four hour period, how many total hours are you on?
<b>PT:</b> Six, seven - 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you end up sleeping in a twenty four hour period eight hours?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so between sleeping and the internet, a big chunk of your day is used up, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I mean, you enjoy it.  You get a lot out of it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Better than what I get with him.  He's always too busy for me.  I said to him, like now, I said, um, after the doctor's, I said, you wanna go to the farmer's market in [DEIDENTIFIED].  Just to get out.  I have my hair fixed, I ain't embarrassed.  He said no, no.  I have to expect the no and say okay.  Now, if he wanted me to go to the farmer's market and I said no, I would hear ah, you don't wanna do nothin', you're always on the computer.  You get my point?
<b>DR:</b> Did you come over by yourself?
<b>PT:</b> No, I make him take me.
<b>DR:</b> So, he drove you over here.
<b>PT:</b> I could drive, doc.  I drove to the hairdresser.  It's just the point that I, I don't feel like driving.  Let him drive.
<b>DR:</b> Well, if he didn't want to go to the farmer's market, is there something else he'd rather do?  That you'd like to do?  Is there a compromise?  Something for both of you?
<b>PT:</b> No, he wants to do his thing.  He wants to, um, what does he want - fix tools, get ready - he's going fishing, trout fishing tomorrow.  I will be alone again, which I am when he goes hunting.  I have my orders to make my special potatoes that we have with the trout.  I do that good.  It's just home fries, I mean, with onion and cheese, but done really nice, yknow.  It goes well with, uh, fresh trout and asparagus.  And like, yknow, I'll be there and, um, I'll be on the computer.  I'll be playing games when he goes out trout fishing.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Does he go by himself?
<b>PT:</b> He goes with a friend.  A male friend.  And doctor, I don't care if he goes.  I'm not worried about that.  He needs to get out and do something.  But my problem with him is that, um, he watches me too closely.  Um, I'm gonna be honest, he says how many baths did you take this week?  I took some baths, what, do I have to - wait, why do I have to keep track if I'm not going nowhere?  If I didn't wanna brush my teeth, not because I'm mentally ill, but because I just don't feel like it, and I don't need somebody to watch over me and say well, you brushed your teeth seven times today.  Maybe you should've did it six.  There's something wrong with you.
<b>DR:</b> It sounds like he's overlooking at things, true.  And a spouse, for somebody that had been in the hospital with depression, sometimes that happens, like, you know, when a person is in the hospital and gets depression, or has, yknow, or has a problem then the spouse can feel powerless, you know, maybe even blame themselves, you know, so they end up on the extra lookout as people are getting better.  Yknow, are there other signs that are gonna happen that that person is gonna ignore - 
<b>PT:</b> He knows that's not gonna happen.
<b>DR:</b> That this person can do?
<b>PT:</b> I know when I am - if it wasn't for myself, and I'm not feeling bad, I would've never been here.  I never would've met you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Because I asked him, please take me to the hospital.  He said no, you don't need to go to the hospital.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> He minimized it, yeah.  
<b>PT:</b> They ain't gonna keep you.  Oh, I said, I think they will.
<b>DR:</b> Yknow, the fact that he goes out and socializes with some of his friends, I mean, might be a good example for you too, but I know all of your social life is on the computer, but you have so much to offer in person.  What I hope for you is that, maybe instead of spending seven hours a day on the computer, maybe it turns into five and for two hours you go out and meet people directly.  You may make that close friend that you're able to do something with.
<b>PT:</b> I have [NAME OTHER].  She came in and spent last weekend over the house.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  But, yknow, he's able to have this friend to go trout fishing with.  I mean, it's best for you to be able to make some friends that you're able to have a live visit - a friend like [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Yeah, [NAME OTHER] came over, she slept over, he made us dinner. Um, we always treat her well.  Her birthday came up and we went on the computer, I bought her a birthday gift and different things and she sleeps in my room because [NAME OTHER] and I don't sleep together.  Which I don't like, but like it's my fault, doctor, because I snore, I have this apnea or whatever it is or, uh, I'm this or I'm that.  Uh, I'm just a problem.  Okay, go sleep on the floor, do what you want, leave me alone, but then you ask me, come to my room, check my light, um, tells me to go to bed.  I feel like he's my mother.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And, um, I don't want a mother.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I want a lover back in my life.  I, if I'm in love, I've noticed this about myself, um, if I'm in love, or if I am occupied, I don't go into troubled water.  I go into troubled water when I'm left alone.  I don't know why I pick that, the knife thing, I pick up a knife now, and I look at the knife and I laugh.  It just - it was there at the moment, I guess, and, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I don't, like - I don't think about hurting somebody.  Now, when I go to sleep, I don't sleep with the crucifix no more.  Dear God, you'll get mad at me that I left you, but I really didn't leave you.  I'm starting to think, I know you don't like it but please, um, be here with me.  I used to sleep with the crucifix in my hand because I was afraid I would wake up and do harm to [INAUDIBLE].  Um, I don't do that no more.  I used to sit and play on the computer and used to say I don't want to hurt nobody.  Don't go there.  That feeling would come oh, God, if I hurt somebody - then I would get panicky.  I don't have that no more.  Um, I will go out and meet people.  I will not be in fear and thinkin' because I'm on Prozac I'm gonna like flip out.
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.  And, and, unless you tell people - I don't think even they'll realize.  
<b>PT:</b> But, I have one thing to say to you.  My vision is blurry a lot.  I know my eyes are not bad because I had them checked.  Prozac will do that to you sometimes?
<b>DR:</b> Not very commonly.  I mean has it been since you've been on the Prozac? 
<b>PT:</b> Well - 
<b>DR:</b> Did it start?  It's not like change of seasons or pollen or?
<b>PT:</b> It could be, because I will start with that.  I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Has it been, been since, I mean, the last few weeks, since it's gotten warmer and things are blooming and -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't notice.  I always had that.  I always have, uh, my eyes are always red.  Remember when I first came here, how red.  
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> Well, I was crying all the time, but the point is, I'm emotionally getting stronger and it's not due to [NAME OTHER], it's due to myself and being with other people.
<b>DR:</b> My guess about the blurred vision before we move on.  You have not had it, and you've been on the Prozac for a while and suddenly it comes up?  There's not some other reasons for it, too?  Yknow, you would've had it from the start with taking the Prozac and the fact that you've been on it for a while, other things can come up that are not related.  There are allergies and other things that come up.
<b>PT:</b> I do have other things that come up.
<b>DR:</b> So, my guess would be more than like it would be the change of seasons and allergies.
<b>PT:</b> Did my face get thinner?  
<b>DR:</b> A little bit.  
<b>PT:</b> I wanted a lot.  I want it all to disappear, you gotta wand?  I want to [INAUDIBLE] better.  No, I think it's because I'm infatuated with this person because he spends a lot of time and he really is good to me.
<b>DR:</b> That's why I was asking if your husband was jealous at all.
<b>PT:</b> My husband would never relate to that, doctor.  His mind does not go there.
<b>DR:</b> But he's very committed.
<b>PT:</b> In a relation - you mean committed to me?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> In a relationship of a partnership?  Yeah.  In a relationship as a lover?  No.  But, um, I guess maybe I have to change that, but I'm not willing to change that yet.  Um, I think it's time that he changed it.  Um, he can come in my room.  He don't have to sleep there, but he can come in my room.  If he comes to see how many times I take a bath, he can surely come into my room and keep me company.  
<b>DR:</b> Well - 
<b>PT:</b> Yknow, it still takes two for a marriage.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And, yknow, just because I had a problem, and you were part of my problem - he don't think he was, but he was part of my problem because he gave me a hard time during it because he couldn't accept what I was going through and, um, he gave me a hard time.  When I say a hard time, like, he, um, if you persist on doing this.  If this happens again, we will take the computer and I will get rid of it.  You will not watch Lifetime any more and I haven't watched Lifetime.  That's another big thing.  The day that I start watching Lifetime and not get affected by it, then I'm a hundred percent cured.  But I'm not ready to go back to Lifetime and watch them people kill people and then think I'm nuts and I'm gonna do that.  See, this all stems from -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Thinking I was not a normal person.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Not that I'm just, uh - and end up like that.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think that you've been down on yourself quite a bit, for a while.
<b>PT:</b> And some people have.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And I think, yknow, right now, you're building up your self esteem, you're obviously setting goals for yourself to feel better about yourself   And my guess is if you start feeling better about yourself, other things in the relationship probably will be easier, but, yknow, uh, you'll see changes there.  When you feel better about what you're doing for yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and he needs to stop being my mother.  He's like that.  He's very controlling.  He doesn't realize that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, that's okay.  He's not hurtful to me, like he wouldn't hit me.  Oh, God, he would never hit me now.  I would really sock it to him.  I would make my jokes now I would say if he came up now, I would say let me get the knife.  I would crack him up.  See, I'm at the point now where I can laugh about it now and, um, I'm happy.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I do think you're doing good.
<b>PT:</b>  I am.  And I'm taking the Prozac.  I don't know do I need another prescription?
<b>DR:</b> Do you have a refill for - I can write another one for ya.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and we'll get another appointment set up, too.
<b>PT:</b> So, are you pleased?
<b>DR:</b> Absolutely.
