<b>Stage I. Ordinary Life: 1960-1979</b>


I came from very stable parents, married for 43 years until
mom died in 1991. My parents had a grade 8 education.
Mom worked part-time taking care of an elderly lady in
her home. My father was a school custodian. Growing up,
I had four brothers and two sisters. I was the youngest. I
heard my mom had a fever while delivering me. There was
a real sense of family, which I cherish tremendously to this
day. There were no traumas in the family and we did not
receive any verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse or
physical punishment. I don't remember my mother or
father ever shouting. We attended the United Church. I had
nightmares for a couple of years at the ages of 6 and 7. The
only thing I can remember at the time when I awoke was
an image that I was too close to the sun and of being too
bundled up.


After my having had schizophrenia I explored the
ancestors and family members; none were identified as
having had schizophrenia or similar type symptoms. In my
immediate family a sibling has affected his health through
overuse of alcohol, and an extended family member
blinked a lot (almost constantly)—a tic disorder. Otherwise,
all family members seem to be stable, everyone happily
adjusted, married.


I grew up in a stable, mature neighborhood all my
childhood until I left for college at age 19. My high school
grades were average. I had part-time jobs during high
school as a stock boy at a department store and another as
a billboard sign painter. One of my interests was designing,
and I designed yearbook covers. I played drums in my
own band with friends and still do to this day. I had
friends, but since I wasn't into sports much and not as
good-looking as others, I was less popular but still liked
due to my sense of humor and being very good at visual
arts. I dated some. My siblings went as far as high school.
I was the only one to consider college. I wanted to be a
graphic designer or a psychologist. Mom said that I was
college material.


<b>Stage II. Recognized First Signs:
Preoccupation With Grandiose Ideas</b>


After graduating from high school in 1978, I went in circles
as to which talent to pursue. I knew I had many abilities—
drummer, visual artist, graphic designer, writer,
comedian, and more; it was hard to keep track of them. I
felt so scattered. It was confusing. I decided to work for a
year as a machinist before enrolling in a full-time college
program. In 1979 I left home to take a room at the YMCA,
living independently with my own free will. There I wrote
a lot of poetry about life, as I had become very philosophical

[p. <i>546</i>]

While working, I began to feel that I had such enormous
insight into subject areas I hadn't previously studied.
I felt as if I possessed a deep knowledge of how certain
things in life worked or could work. It was so tempting, so
interesting, so captivating. To resist these preoccupying
thoughts would have been to deny what I began to consider
as my strengths and the future of my career.


The thoughts were so strong and seemed so unique,
how could I ignore them? I did not know what to think of
them except that, because they presented themselves, I
thought I had to pay attention. I began to think of myself
as being somewhat special and having a special mind to be
thinking these things. I thought a lot about things—seeing
in my mind's eye how things were related to me. It was
like I was trying to understand an object's appearance and
behavior from different vantage points. I was hardly ever
bored because I constantly thought up problem-solving
answers to things I saw around me or problems that I
imagined. These ideas would capture my attention, forcing
me to question in a profound way what was going on.


I thought about how physical objects would affect
each other in a given spatial area and how color and light
would affect people. I invented an intelligence test (not
actually knowing how measuring is done by psychometrists).
I would spend hours designing my own kinds of
psychological tests with visuals and colors. At times I created
new kinds of Rorschach inkblot tests. I thought I had
some insight—an instinctual knowledge of what a person's
feedback to the tests would mean. There appeared to
be some deep meaning in what I was endeavoring to do. I
felt like I had been given a difficult problem to solve in
order to make some major discovery. For example, I
would think about physics-related concepts. Before, I was
never interested, not even mildly, in physics! I did not try
to avoid the realities of life by thinking these thoughts.
Rather, they surprised me, making me think there was
something special to be realized through these thinking
excursions.


I can see now that the products I worked on were not
saleable. That is, in the real world, such inventions and creations
made for market go through (and rightfully so) a rigid
feasibility test. My ideas wouldn't have made it past the first
phase of a market assessment. In retrospect, I feel I was
sidetracked for years with unfeasible and unrealistic ideas.


These out-of-the-ordinary thoughts were the first
signs of my illness (which I did not recognize at the time).
I did not have the experience of this kind of thinking in
high school or any other time. Because I now know that
these thoughts did not let me advance in life, I feel somewhat
ashamed to speak of them. What good did they do
me or anyone? None. I became so preoccupied at times
with these complex thoughts that they interfered with my
ability to concentrate on other things. Looking back, I can
say that this huge preoccupation meant nothing and
robbed me of valuable time.


<b>Stage III. Finding Explanations for
What Was Happening Led to
Progressively More Suspiciousness
</b>


Because I believed much of my thought-life was entertaining
and inventive, I thought I was "chosen." I thought I
was becoming one of the next sprouting great thinkers
endowed with important knowledge. I figured surely not
many people get unusual, deep, and creative thoughts
about products, literary pieces, concepts for movie scripts,
games, musical compositions, and visual artworks.


Since I had such an inventory of what I believed to be
ingenious ideas, I began to think that someone was interested
in capturing them or me to profit from it. Because I
thought my ideas could be worth millions of dollars, I
wondered if highly positioned executives in the sales
industry were spying on me or somehow devising a way to
tap into and record my creative thoughts because I was
important. This fueled my grandiose value of myself. It is
true that I very much felt a need to be needed. The more I
thought that my ideas were extraordinary, the more I
began to think that others were going to try to steal my
ideas from me. Then I felt afraid that my adversaries might
disagree with my thoughts and understandings about life,
or be jealous of my creative ideas—wanting to suppress
them or introduce them as their own. Thus, I wondered,
too, if I was being controlled by my persecutors in their
efforts to tap into my creative thinking process.


Being so creative was scary, to go out so far on an
unexplored thought limb knowing that most other people
didn't do that. It was lonely mental territory. There was
something very frightening about thinking I had "discovered"
or was "endowed with" far-out thoughts. There was
the fear that anyone could know where I had been in my
thoughts and what those thoughts were, especially when I
regarded the creative thoughts as "diamonds in the rough."


On the job as a machinist, I began to be preoccupied
with thoughts that others could somehow know what I was
thinking, that my entire thought-life was made available to
others, who were thereby stealing my ideas. Every day I

[p. <i>547</i>]

My anxiety and panic grew as I believed my mind
was being controlled. Fearful of this, I couldn't help but
suspect that some people (strangers mostly) in my presence
and while I was alone were knowing my thoughts; I
suspected that those people were the ones inserting
unwanted thoughts into my mind and making me think
things against my will. I went to college for the first time,
and the stress increased a lot.


One day, I saw glowing vertical gold bars all around
me while standing at a bus stop. I interpreted this experience
as comforting and that this was God's way of telling
me that I was protected and would be okay.


I thought a lot about thinking. Although it seemed I
had no choice but to think these "important" thoughts, I
felt successful if I was in control of my thinking enough to
perform mental feats. This meant that no one else was taking
my thoughts or putting thoughts in my head or able to
know my thoughts. I realize today that although that kind
of thinking was unproductive, I needed to reassure myself
that I was in control of my thoughts. By delving into the
backstage, behind-the scenes workings of my thinking, I
was assuring myself that I was in control of my own
thoughts. I had to reassure myself that I was not being
toyed with telepathically by someone else—that it was
only I who was minding my own business, that I really did
have a mind of my own.


<b>Stage IV. First Signs/Personal
Recognition—Things Are Really
Different Here
</b>


After only a few weeks into full-time college in fall 1979,
these fearful, tormenting thoughts became increasingly
distressing to the point where I was desperate. I went to
the philosophy and psychology departments at the University
of Toronto and asked professors there about what
might be going on inside my head. This was an awkward
and desperate thing for me to do. I was directed to the
Clarke Institute of Psychiatry down the street. Considering
that this problem was of the mind, going to a hospital to
see a doctor seemed to be the only, and best, thing to do. I
went there out of urgency—I couldn't take it anymore. I
had to be seen by someone. At the Clarke, an interviewing
nurse asked me if I believed others could read my mind. I
lied, saying "no" because I thought she must have had
mental telepathy to know that this was true to even ask
such a question!


I left feeling extremely discouraged and without
direction. Because of the intrusive nature of some people
being privy to my thoughts, I could not help but conclude
that my mind was going to die from a telepathic thrashing—
that my mind would be left in ruin to the point of
total insanity, that I would literally lose my whole mind. I
believed I was being persecuted, plotted against, by telepathic
means. I felt a strong need to hold on to my sanity. I
did not want to have extrasensory perception (ESP)—to
send or receive thoughts. This idea frightened me, and I
struggled to believe that I was not telepathic. I didn't want
to have anything to do with it at all. I wished more than
anything that this whole telepathy thing was not happening
and could not possibly be true.


I found myself staying up late into the night thinking
out my ideas—not forcibly, but following a stream of racing
thoughts. My thoughts were not frantic, nor did I have
mood swings at all. My ambitions in life changed. I was
going to disregard college classes and jobs and assume my
now very important, geniuslike self, pursuing the development
of new and inventive ideas that would make me
highly successful. I thought that I might become rich as a
result of my inventive ideas, though I wasn't interested in
becoming famous. Because the ideas were so prevalent
and there was meaning in exploring them for some special
purpose, I felt that to check them with reality would've
been unnecessary. I think also that I was afraid to check
with reality for fear that my ideas might be deflated and
my sense of having a useful and meaningful direction in
pursuing these might be demolished. It was like I was
compensating for the great interference the illness created
in my life and I had to keep my ego afloat, though this
assessment is not something I wanted to recognize at the
time.


I'm sure my brain chemistry became more imbalanced
through exhaustion. And as my thoughts consumed
me, my ambitions in life were forced aside. I became preoccupied
with dying. I was preoccupied with polar opposites
and values (e.g., God/ Satan, life/death). I withdrew
from social contact, laughed out loud to what I was thinking
about, felt emotionally flat. I often misinterpreted real-life
occurrences such as the behaviors of others as somehow
related to those conspiring against me. When people
passed by (police cruisers, door-to-door salespeople), I
thought they must be there to spy on me. When I half-heard
a conversation in the distance or the honking of a
car, I would think it held special significance for me. I
would randomly open a dictionary and find a word ("die,"
"liar," "evil") and interpret how the word had special
meaning for me. I saw Satan's face in an evil expression in

[p. <i>548</i>]

<b>Stage V. Recognition of Problem,
Starting Treatment</b>


Come March 1980, I knew something was terribly wrong
and I needed help right away. After consulting the college
nurse, I was advised to take a break. I admitted myself to a
hospital psychiatric ward and started taking antipsychotic
medication (trifluoperazine) for the first time to slow my
racing thoughts. I was relieved to know that this problem
was recognizable and treatable in a medical environment. I
remember being interviewed for a long time by a nurse
and a doctor. I felt comforted, as it appeared to me during
this process that something was going to be done—that I
was going to be taken care of. For the next few nights I
was put in a private room for observation. This alleviated
my fears of other people. On the ward, I saw other people,
some of whom I learned had the same problems as I did.
The only thing that freaked me out, as I recall, was another
patient who came up to me and said he could see the colors
of my aura around my head. But he was a patient and I
thought he couldn't be right about this and that this was
probably because of his illness. The meds made me sleep a
lot.


After 2 weeks there, I felt stabilized enough, was discharged
from the hospital, and given medication. It was at
this hospital where I was given an actual diagnosis: paranoid-type
schizophrenia. From 1979 to 1985 I suffered
from this. It was shortly after being hospitalized that my
parents learned more about schizophrenia. My mom and
dad were very supportive of me. They exhibited this support
by establishing a local Schizophrenia Society (1980).
Going to these meetings, my parents and I met other families
who were just beginning to understand schizophrenia.


At this time it occurred to me that it was silly to be
doing much of what I was doing about my "inventions" as
a layperson. But their allure was so strong and enticing
and the "high" of the excitement of my impending success
at discovery and invention was so great that I set out to
make this endeavor my career. I became irresponsible
about time, sleeping in and staying up late. I stopped
studying, which was something I couldn't concentrate on
anyway. I just went through the motions, though failing
badly.


But no matter where I went, the tormenting thoughts
would not cease. I felt powerless, horrified, and hindered
now that my education was set aside. I would continue to
feel this way for 5 years (even while on antipsychotic
medication). My main feeling was paranoia—day after
day—and every day I thought I was going to die from
whoever was monitoring my thoughts and inserting
unwanted thoughts into my mind. I felt so isolated, even
when I was in a crowd. I thought that someone around me
might be the one who was doing this to me, but I would
never know who. It seemed the source was elusive. I didn't
know if a person was doing this or if it was some alien
entity. It was surprising for me to ponder all of this
because I had never before thought, or cared, about mental
telepathy, ESP, alien beings, or the like.


<b>Stage VI. Seeking Solutions—Trying
Everything</b>


Summer break 1980 came, and I took up summer jobs. But
I realized I was mentally unemployable—totally preoccupied
by fears of dying, fears of others. I couldn't work at
any of these jobs because I was too preoccupied with paranoid
thoughts, so I decided to do a second year of college
through 1981, even though I was hardly mentally well to
do so. I tried to fix things, as these thoughts persisted, even
when I was on medication. I thought I needed to try herbal
medicines, becoming more religious, and taking anti-anxiety
pills; I tried on my own to use visualization to melt
away my stress in addition to taking my medication regularly.
Experimenting to discover what works and what
doesn't led me eventually to discovering how to rid myself
of the delusions.


<b>Stage VII. Beginning to Question
Delusions</b>


Leaving college in March 1981 after failing to get a
degree, I returned home. I was sleeping more than I was
awake due to the medications. In 1982 I had a med
change (to chlorpromazine) as I was too tranquilized. Figure
1 contains a Mental Health Center Note describing
my status in May 1982. The medication did help slow my
thinking down and allowed me to better think things
through.


In 1982, while I was attending a day program at the
local mental health center in my hometown, a counselor
told me that my hallucinations and delusions were not
external to me but were products of my own mind. This
piece of knowledge helped me tremendously, although it
took me about 6 months to believe this was true. Thoughts
do, in fact, seem to just pop into our minds at times without

[p. <i>549</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000048407-I0001&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

There was nothing happening in my small hometown.
Thinking ahead, I moved to Hamilton in 1983,
where my good friend lived and arranged to have a med
assessment through my family physician from whom I
received my meds refill. I then was put on a reduced
chlorpromazine dose. I was provided vocational rehabilitation
for those who were mentally ill—tested for aptitude,
given a work assessment, and placed in a few different
trial workplaces. Learning about my illness and living
skills, a counselor would ask only how I was feeling and
how the meds were with me. I wasn't seeing a therapist. It
was during this time I began to figure out a way to undo
my delusions. I reasoned that if some of my thoughts
were disturbed, I could use my unaffected mind to think
myself well again.


A delusion is a false belief one believes strongly and
does not question. Yet one does not want to be misled by
or base one's life on false beliefs. Therefore, it is important
to be open to exploring the possibility that each paranoid
belief may be a delusion.


For me to understand myself objectively required a
commitment to learn the truth. Doubt made me curious. I
probably would not have motivated myself had it not
been for a basic desire to survive what seemed to be a
life-or-death situation; I thought I was going to die—be
killed, kidnapped, assassinated, stolen away, or compromised
in some bad way. I pressed on to find out what was
going on.


<b>Stage VIII. Devising a "Four-Step"
System of Recovering Myself</b>


The degree of paranoia stifled my ability to live and think
freely. False suspicions impeded my progress in going forward.
Once I began to question, my suspicions could not
be verified. Once I acknowledged that there were holes of
uncertainty, I began to think that some of my thoughts
might be delusional even though they had the appearance
of truth and believability. As each day passed and I wasn't
killed, I dug deeper at my own scared pace.


Thus in 1983 on my own, I began designing a "four-step
system" to question, recognize, counterargue, and
replace delusions.


<b>Step 1. Begin to Doubt—Question the Belief With
"How" Questions</b>. Out of all the kinds of questions—
Who? What? Where? When? Why?—the question of
How? has been the most practical, the most helpful, in my
recovery (e.g., "How can this be possible?"). However,
the usual question that one asks is, Why? The question
Why? easily led me down the path toward thinking these
amazing things were happening to me because I was so
very special, because of divine intervention. Why? can
easily be supported by ill-reasoning. A person's answer to
why he or she is being persecuted can itself be a delusional
idea. Instead, one must explore How?—how he or
she is being subject to others' schemes.


When I started asking How? it helped me examine
reality. For example, despite the profound conviction of
my beliefs of being a victim of some parapsychical mind
tormentor, I asked, How is it that those I believe to be following
me never really give themselves away? How is it

[p. <i>550</i>]

How is it that I have been feeling very paranoid
about being persecuted for so long, yet I haven't been
killed, assassinated, kidnapped, or imprisoned? For so
long, I have suspected that a plot is being undertaken to
victimize me, but nothing along these lines has taken
place? I have not disappeared.


How is it that even though I suspect that I am being
written about in the newspaper in which my name is
exchanged with a pseudonym, no one else I know has
mentioned to me the parallel similarities? No one has
even interviewed me! How is it that, although I believe
that I have been mentioned on TV, no one else in my circle
of friends and family has mentioned hearing this as
well? How is it that another can be making me experience
bodily sensations when I know that these sensations
can occur on their own? How is it that others can
be hearing my thoughts out loud when they don't seem
to be doing anything with those thoughts? How is it that
other people know my thoughts but none of these people
reveal to me that they know something only I could
know when I have not shared it? How is it that I believe
that people are knowing my thoughts telepathically?
Doesn't this make me telepathic in order to acknowledge
this? It was paradoxical for me to realize that in
order for me to have the notion that somebody was reading
my thoughts, I would have to be telepathically
inclined!


The presence of "doubt" became a welcome discovery.
As I looked in the ceiling fan ducts, the cracks in the
wall, and other orifices in my apartment, I could find no
person and no recording equipment. On the way to a
friend's house I had to stop at a doughnut shop to use the
washroom. I still had the same feeling that I was being
watched. I began to wonder how my pursuer could be so
fast in setting up spying equipment when I didn't even
know beforehand that I was to stop off at this washroom.
For me to be "followed" by someone to the extent I
believed, someone would have to be as close to me as I
am to myself!


Doubting is constructive; the delusion is challenged.
To doubt the validity of a delusion does not mean to doubt
yourself as a whole. Doubting can be the gateway to truth.
Without doubt, one's delusions are preserved. With doubt,
one discovers. Embrace doubt to rethink and disperse
fears. Doubt eliminates uncertainty. It is the seed of argument.
The existence of "doubt" surrounding a delusion
allows for reality checks.


I began to doubt and approach the various delusion
scenarios one at a time at a crawling pace over a 3-year
period (1982-1985) until they were gone. I worked on
each one 100 percent until the delusions were not just
diminished but totally eliminated.


<b>Step 2. Recognize and Identify the Delusion</b>. The second
step was to recognize the delusion scenarios and to
identify delusions for what they were—false. Every time I
compared reality to a delusion, I found reality to be the
very opposite of what the delusional idea was making me
believe. It became apparent to me that reality was something
to be considered. This pet theory of mine was one I
referred to as the "opposite principle." I believe a delusion
can be eliminated with its polar opposite; the opposite of
delusion is reality, rationality, truth. What a relief it was
for me to discover that the opposite of what I thought was
real, was in fact real, thereby making me aware of the
falsehood of my initial perception.


How does one recognize a delusion in the first place?
After questioning, I began to recognize areas of uncertainty,
the next stage to recognizing a delusion. Delusional
beliefs differ from nondelusional beliefs.


1. I came to realize that delusions were <i>forced on me</i>.
They were unwanted, and I did not choose them. I did not
choose to believe that bad people were pursuing me in
such a disturbing way. I thought I "knew." Knowing preceded
thinking. Beliefs (such as those we have about political
parties, abortion, miracles and angels, capital punishment,
past-life regression, whether real men cry, and so
on) are not normally acquired forcibly and without choice.
They are commonly accepted, shared beliefs with others.
One chooses them. Starting from a point where they do not
exist in the mind at all, beliefs are normally built—they
are added to and sometimes decreased according to the
weight of evidence, opinion, and so forth. On the other
hand, delusions are in-your-face beliefs that bypass one's
decision-making process.


2. Another difference is <i>intentionality</i>. Most of what
we choose to believe contains a purpose or an intention.
Although all beliefs (whether ordinarily accepted or delusive)
have meaning, intention stems from choice. In delusions
there is no choice with regard to theme, content, or
intensity. Reality is something that is neither derivative
nor dependent. It exists necessarily, independent of the

[p. <i>551</i>]

3. Conviction, pervasiveness, intensity, obtrusiveness—
these are powerful delusion characteristics that
shield the person with schizophrenia from noticing a delusion's
false façade.


4. Political machination by powerful, ubiquitous
groups believed to have skill in concealment is a common
element of delusional explanations: the FBI, the KGB, the
CIA, the Catholic Church, God, and Jesus are among the
favorites. This kind of theory meets the requirements of
explaining the invisibility of the agent (who is disguised)
but makes it necessary to look behind the disguises. Thus,
physicians, nurses, family members, and other patients
may be hypothesized to be members of the agent group
(Maher 1974). It is wise if these powerful groups are part
of your belief to go to step 5.


5. Delusion and reality cannot occupy the same territory,
but bits and pieces of reality and delusions can intermingle,
making them harder to sort out.


6. Delusions and hallucinations are a product of one's
mind; they do not come from an exterior source.


7. A delusion is always an experience that is imaginable.
It often reflects previous imaginative undertakingsd—
pre-illness concerns.


To be rational means to perceive reality and to draw
proper inferences from it.


<b>Step 3. Examine the Evidence. Gather Disconfirming
Evidence. Create and Write Down Counterarguments</b>.
The belief stayed fixed until I researched and found skeptical
debunking counterarguments and disconfirming evidence.
Overcome by the stranglehold of delusions, I
fought almost unceasingly for the troops of reality to save
me. If reality was a door, I could say that I knocked on it
10,000 times while I trembled in fear, unshielded from the
barrage of imaginary horrors that surrounded me. Then I
began to calm down more and more until I no longer
believed in the ESP intrusion ideas.


Initially, I believed I was being persecuted by way of
mental telepathic intrusions, having thoughts inserted into
my mind that I did not believe to be mine, having my
thoughts known by others. I believed someone was knowing
what I was doing and thinking. I thought circumstances were
contrived. The "implanted thoughts" were designed as a ploy
to "get me" or try to make me go crazy. I decided, "If I'm
going to die at any moment from this antagonistic source, I
may as well investigate who it is and face my horror."


At my own pace, I investigated my delusions. Checking
reality, I looked in wall vents and other areas that
caused a large degree of fear and apprehension—places
where I believed there might be a hidden camera or tape
recorder. A belief, in and of itself, can't kill a person; neither
can a misbelief. What can confronting a belief do that
is worse than what is involved with the belief itself? With
trepidation, I began to read scores of books on ESP to see
if I was really a victim of a telepath's torment. I am comfortable
in knowing that mental telepathy cannot work.
When a delusion is stacked against a conscious awareness
of reality and rationality, the delusion falls apart. While the
delusive ideas disintegrate, their pretense is revealed.


I put on my detective cap. I would test out arguments.
I tried to develop the strongest arguments possible against
the falsehoods. I made a list of all the rational alternatives
that I could think of. I looked for evidence for what really
was happening and what really wasn't happening. I asked
myself, "How do I know this?" Did I actually see it or just
a "sign" of it? Did I really hear it, or could I have misinterpreted
what I heard? Did I smell, taste, or feel it? Did
someone tell me this? Is most of my evidence beyond my
senses or interpretations of signs and symbols? I tried to
test reality in terms of the here and now transactions with
other people rather than assuming what their supposed
intentions were or predicting what would happen. Since I
realized I had a bias toward thinking meager evidence
confirmed my false beliefs, I looked particularly hard for
disconfirming evidence.


To rethink my belief system, I compared the way
things really are with what my delusions claimed. Over
time, I repeatedly found nothing that would substantiate
the convictions of my delusions. I viewed each delusional
experience objectively from a reality standpoint. As I
grilled my false beliefs under the examining light of truth,
they failed. Nothing could support them except coincidence
or further misinterpretation on my part. I developed
counterarguments and explored alternative interpretations.


If I tended to rebelieve a delusion, I decided I hadn't
argued and investigated enough. It can take years to dismiss
a belief altogether. Since I guess I had a tendency to
jump to conclusions or make thinking errors, a delusion
would sometimes resurface after I had thought I had
worked on it enough. I investigated further, developing
counterarguments at my scared, crawling pace. It took
time to get over the shaky thought that a delusion might
still have life.


<b>Step 4. Replace Delusions With the Objective Truth</b>.
The last step was to replace the delusions with reality,
truth, and rationality. To replace a delusion may simply be
to totally believe the delusion is false. The truth, for me,
was that mental telepathy does not work. I began to realize
that there is a big clue to recovery in all of this—delusions
are opposite to reality. To prove to myself that
something is false, I had to prove that something else is

[p. <i>552</i>]

Here is an example of how I used the steps on one
delusion:


1. Doubting/questioning: Are people <i>really</i> spying on
me with monitoring devices?


2. Recognizing delusion: Can I find clear, tangible,
evidence to indicate that I am being spied upon? No. This
paranoid thinking must be delusional; it does not agree
with reality.


3. Counterarguing/finding disconfirming evidence: I
look into walls, floor radiators, ceiling ducts, and other orifices
where I suspect a spying device is hidden, but I never
find any. I can't identify one specific person following me
and spying on me as I have suspected.


4. Replacing the delusion: I replace this paranoid
delusion with objective truth and reality: truly no one is
after me in a conspiring way.


This belief modification illustrates a cognitive change
toward my environment and people around me.


After implementing this method of four steps starting
in 1982, my delusions stopped one by one in the course of
about a 3-year period. My counterarguments had worked. I
recognized the first delusion was gone in 1984. After that I
began weaning off medications (chlorpromazine) S-L-O-W-L-Y
for about a year and a half until I went off altogether.
I have not been on any medications since 1985.
From 1985 to 1987, I recovered from the trauma of having
this illness. I continued to check my thinking and made
self-assurances that I was okay. I was able to do this successfully
without further medications. From 1985 to 1990 I
continued with vocational rehabilitation/work assessment.
It was not until about 1986 that I was able to get a part-time
job. I began writing up my ideas around 1987 and reading
journals in the therapy field to support my method and discovered
that others, primarily in England, were using similar
ways called cognitive therapy to help schizophrenia
patients rid themselves of delusions. I returned to college in
1990, graduating in 1992 in graphic design. In 1994, I finished
my book, <i>On Second Thought—Eliminating Paranoid
Delusions in Schizophrenia</i> (unpublished), which contains
the Delusion Elimination Equation (figure 2).


I feel certain that delusional thinking cannot occur in
my mind anymore. The delusions are stopped and I
believe will not occur again. Carlson (1998) writes,
"Knowing is more powerful than believing" (p. 35). I

<b>Stage IX. Getting Help</b>


I do not make schizophrenia a purely cognitive illness. I
accept the physical component (including genetic predisposition)
to this illness, namely the role of dopamine receptors
in the brain triggered by stress. In reviewing my recovery, I
came to ask myself, "How can my mind, my nonmaterial
rationality, affect a change in my brain's (the material's)
chemistry and thereby correct an imbalance?" When I first
wondered about this "mind over matter" dilemma, I also
wondered if this idea had a psychotic background. I had been
hesitant to share this mind-chemistry inquiry with health
professionals lest the question itself stemmed from ill-thinking.
I asked myself, "Is this the kind of thinking that is typically
born out of schizophrenia?" Successful cognitive
restructuring and belief modification efforts may realign or
bring into balance the neurochemicals involved. Thus the
processing of information in one's brain can then be filtered
correctly. With less confusion concerning delusive convictions,
my stress level and subsequently my brain chemistry
could shuffle into proper balance again. Franklin (1986)
writes that this new discipline is based on the perception that
human emotion, thought, and behavior are the result of the
interplay of molecules across the surface of brain cells. The
scientific premise here is that mental processes are therefore
measurable in chemical terms. Backus and Chapian (1980)
confirm what I have believed all along:


The state of your biochemistry can affect the way you
feel. There are ways to change your biochemistry; one
of the ways is through drugs. Another way to change
is to begin maintaining an adequate nutritional base,
exercise, and a properly-functioning body. Your
thoughts, too, can change your biochemistry. That's
right; what you are thinking right now can actually
change the chemical composition of your brain cells
and the rest of your central nervous system. (p. 26)


<b>What Are We Doing To Help People
With Schizophrenia Lessen the Impact
of Delusions?</b>


Resource opportunities such as I have presented to diminish/eliminate
delusions ought to be accessible to consumers.
I believe that not all of the consumers' thought-life
is ill and that they can learn objective thinking skills
and to exercise an awareness of reality. Certainly, counterarguments
and disconfirming evidence against the concept
of mind-reading ideas must be made comprehensible and
be specifically tailored to a consumer's delusion scenario.
I believe that consumers can adapt my strategies to their
delusion descriptions. Working on these at one's own pace
is best. Recovery takes time, and relapses may occur. I
emphasize the importance of medication that allows the
consumer to learn strategies when ready.


Consumers, I have been told, feel encouraged by my
recovery, but I am quick to extinguish any false hope. Certainly,
there are some consumers who may not be able to
eliminate their delusions. But I maintain that a chance to
diminish a delusion by a nonconfrontational belief modification
approach is better than unnecessarily living with
lifelong paranoid fears.
