Behavior is the outward expression of what we think and
feel. Children are often unable to express their thoughts
and feelings in words; therefore, they show us their inner
selves by acting out and showing us what is going on in their
minds. As professionals, we need to be aware of this and learn to
watch and "listen" to what a child is telling us. Usually, children
do not even realize what they are communicating and therefore
may not be able to explain themselves if questioned about their
behavior.


As children grow and develop over time, their behaviors and
how they express themselves also change. To better understand
what a child is expressing through his or her behavior, we must
be aware of each child's developmental level and life circumstances.
With this knowledge, we are in a better position to know
whether or not the child's behavior is of concern or if it is normal
at his or her age and life circumstance. For example, throwing a
tantrum is quite normal for a 2-year-old, but if a 10-year-old
tantrums at the same level, we would be more concerned and
would need to investigate why a 10-year-old needs to express
himself or herself in such a manner. Is it because the child's
mother is depressed and the only way the child can gain the
attention he or she needs is by tantruming? Before trying to "fix"

? <i>General Categories of Behavior Problems</i>


<i>
<b>Internalizing</b>
</i>


Internalizing disorders are based on behaviors and feelings
that are more inwardly directed. Because children with internalizing
disorders are often not disruptive to others, these children
can be overlooked and not referred for appropriate help. Anxiety
and depression are the most common internalizing disorders in
children, although often maltreated children experience posttraumatic
stress disorder. In children, it can be difficult to identify
these disorders because they exhibit many symptoms differently
than adults so that a depressed child may appear very different
from a depressed adult. The following is a list of some symptoms
that may be normal in the short term but may be of concern if
they persist or if a child experiences many of these at once:
agitation, nightmares, avoidance of activities or people, difficulty
falling or staying asleep (insomnia) or hypersomnia (sleeping too
much), difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, irritability, being
easily fatigued, poor appetite or overeating, low self-esteem, and
feelings of hopelessness.


<b>
<i>Externalizing</i>
</b>


Externalizing disorders are based on behaviors and feelings
that are outwardly directed and generally easily observable. The
behaviors associated with these disorders are often disruptive to
others and therefore are addressed more quickly than internalizing
disorders. Therefore, it is important for professionals to be
watchful of all children in their care because many children with
internalizing disorders are not identified and therefore continue
to suffer alone while the children with externalizing disorders
receive much attention. Girls tend to be internalizers, whereas
boys tend to be externalizers. The most common externalizing
disorders in children are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and a group of disorders of acting-out behaviors--disruptive

[p. <i>275</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00295&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is important to note that in children depression and anxiety,
disorders we normally think of as internalizing disorders, are
often exhibited through externalizing behaviors. A child who is
acting out in school (e.g., throwing objects and getting into fights)
may actually be depressed, although he or she does not appear
depressed in the same way as an adult would appear (e.g., sluggish
and sad). It is important to refer children with such problems to
mental health professionals for additional evaluation.


• <i>Assessment</i>


To obtain the best sense of a child and a child's behavior, one
should gather information in a variety of ways: (a) direct observation
of the child, (b) reports from caregivers, and (c) the use of
objective screening measures. For any of these methods, it is
recommended that the caregiving professional observe the child
in different settings and make inquiries of multiple informants.
It is important to speak to the child, parents (both, if possible),
teachers, and any other adult involved in the care of the child.
Children often act differently in various environments, and therefore
each informant may have distinct or even contrasting views
of the child. These methods are discussed further as follows:


<i>Observation:</i> When observing a child, the goal is to learn more
about the child's behavior, and therefore it is important to
examine how the child interacts with others (especially peers and
significant adults), what frustrates or stresses the child (recess,
math, transitions from one activity to the next, etc.), and how the
child copes with frustration and stress (does the child withdraw,
become aggressive, or become agitated?).

[p. <i>276</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00296&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Caregiver report:</i> This is an interview with the caregiver in which
the caregiving professional is trying to gain as much information
about the child's behavior as possible.


<i>Screening measures:</i> The most common screening measures used
to assess children's behavior include the Child Behavior Checklist
and the Conner's Rating Scales. These measures have both parent
and teacher forms. Each questionnaire lists a range of problematic
child behaviors that may be grouped into an overall set of
problem scales (e.g., attention problems, social problems, and
anxious or depressed). If enough items in a group are checked by
the informant, the child is said to be exhibiting significant problems
in that area.

<b>
<i>When to Refer</i>
</b>


When a child's behavior, internalizing or externalizing, interferes
with a child's functioning (e.g., peer or family relationships,
academic functioning, emotional well-being, and physical
health), it is recommended that the child be referred for additional
assessment. For example, when a child is acting out in
school and therefore is unable to focus on his or her work and is
not achieving as expected, the child should be referred for a
psychological evaluation and perhaps psychotherapy. When a
child's behavior changes dramatically, such as when a child who
is generally outgoing suddenly becomes very withdrawn and shy,
a referral should be considered.


<b>
<i>To Whom to Refer</i>
</b>


There are many professionals who work with behavior problems
in children. In an outpatient setting, a child may be referred
to a clinical social worker, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist. Often,
schools have their own counselors who may be able to work with
the child. If a child needs a complete psychological evaluation,
the child should be referred to a psychologist because psychologists
are the only professionals trained to do a full battery of

The term <i>child and youth development</i> is a very broad one.
For the purpose of this chapter, <i>development</i> refers to the
child's cognitive, educational, motor, and language development
as well as the development of adaptive behavior (see
Appendix 4). Children who have experienced trauma of any type
(be it physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or physical or emotional
neglect) often show signs of delayed development. In fact,
it is almost expected that a maltreated child will demonstrate
difficulties in at least one area of development, although no
specific effects of maltreatment have been observed. The difficulties
may not be due directly to the maltreatment; rather, the
problems may be related to the troubled environment that is
associated with maltreatment and in which the child lives. A child
who has been neglected may lag behind other children of the same
age in motor and language development, or a child who has been
abused may act out or be unable to focus in school, leading to
academic problems. As a caregiving professional, one can have a
significant impact on the life of a child by learning more about
development and understanding when to refer a child to the
appropriate professional to further evaluate and treat if necessary.


The following section describes each area of development, the
measures commonly used to evaluate each area, and possible

[p. <i>279</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00299&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• <i>Areas of Development and Assessment Measures</i>


<i>Cognitive development:</i> refers to a child's cognitive or intellectual
abilities, commonly referred to as intelligence quotient (IQ). A
cognitive evaluation assesses what a child is capable of doing
rather than what he or she is currently achieving. Cognitive
abilities generally assessed are a child's ability to problem solve,
how a child thinks about or understands his or her world, how
and what a child understands what is said to him or her, and how
and what a child is able to communicate to others. The most
common cognitive assessment measure for children is the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition. Screening measures
are not recommended due to their serious limitations.


<i>Educational development:</i> refers to what a child is learning or his
or her level of achievement in school. An educational evaluation
assesses what the child is actually doing or achieving as opposed
to what he or she is capable of doing (as described previously). A
child is diagnosed with a learning disability when he or she is not
achieving at the level expected given his or her cognitive abilities
(IQ). An educational evaluation generally assesses the main areas
of schooling, such as mathematics, spelling, reading, and writing.
Measures commonly used to assess educational development
include the Wechlser Individual Achievement Test and the Woodcock-Johnson
Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised. The Wide
Range Achievement Test-Third Edition is a frequently used
screener.


<i>Motor development:</i> refers to how a child is developing in terms
of gross motor skills (sitting, standing, and walking) and fine
motor skills. Children attain motor developmental milestones
within an age range. For example, children begin to walk between
9 and 18 months of age. Common measures used to assess a
child's motor development include the Bayley Scales of Infant
Development-Third Edition (BSID-III) and the Denver Developmental
Screening Test-Revised (DDST-R).

[p. <i>280</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00300&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Language development:</i> refers to how a child is developing in
terms of his or her language acquisition. For example, children
generally imitate new words by 12 months of age and combine
words into short sentences by approximately 24 months of age.
Common measures used to assess a child's language development
include the BSID-III, the Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental
Scale, the Early Language Milestones, and the DDST-R.


<i>Adaptive behavior:</i> refers to how a child functions in the day-to-day
world. Skill areas included in adaptive behavior assessments
are communication, socialization, motor, and daily living skills.
A common measure used to assess a child's adaptive functioning
is the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales for Children.

<b>
<i>When to Refer</i>
</b>


In general, if the caregiving professional has questions or
concerns about a child's development, the professional should
not hesitate to call the primary care physician and inquire as to
whether the child should be evaluated. Specifically, if a child fails
a screening exam, is exhibiting significant difficulties in school,
fails to attain developmental milestones, or appears significantly
"slower" than other children, a call to the primary care physician
is warranted.


<b>
<i>To Whom to Refer</i>
</b>


Children generally need to be assessed by a primary care
physician before referral to a specialist. It is helpful to the
physician to provide as much information about the child as
possible. If the child's parents are unavailable, and if the physician
does not have prior information on the child, the caregiver
accompanying the child should have a detailed medical history
of the child, such as birth history, birth weight, birth complications,
neonatal history, ages of developmental milestones, hospitalizations,
serious illnesses or injuries, allergies, current medications,
and family history of illnesses. Information should also be

The emotional experience of a child or adult is one of the
most complex aspects of human existence. It is also one
of the most fragile. At the most basic level, emotions
consist of private internal sensations that can be experienced and
described only by the individual. Emotions experienced internally,
however, influence all other aspects of behavior and
thought, resulting in observable changes that reflect different
emotional states. For example, children from the preschool period
onward can label the internal sensations associated with
experiencing anger, and it is usually relatively easy for adults to
identify the outward, behavioral manifestations of anger in the
typically developing child. During development, both the internal
and the external aspects of emotions change significantly as
the ability to regulate emotional expression matures. This developmental
process can be easily disrupted by traumatic or stressful
incidents in a child's life and by the absence of appropriately
supportive and nurturing relationships with parents or caregivers.
When this occurs, children display emotional disturbance that
can have a profound negative impact on their ability to successfully
negotiate life's challenges.


Children who are maltreated are at particular risk for developing
emotional problems. Negative and traumatic experiences

[p. <i>283</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00303&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• <i>Evaluation</i>


There is no one agreed-on method for evaluating children's
emotional state. This is complicated by the fact that clear standards
for distinguishing normal from abnormal emotional functioning
and expression do not exist. In this situation, it is important
to obtain reports from several individuals in a child's or
adolescent's life before reaching a conclusion about the presence
or absence of an emotional disturbance. When there is agreement
across settings and among important individuals in a child's life,
concern is increased that an emotional disturbance is present and
creating problems in the child's life. In addition to your own
professional observations, important individuals to include in this
assessment are parents, teachers, siblings, and other adults who
interact with maltreated children. Each individual may be some-what
biased in his or her personal perspective, but moderate
agreement between individuals is strong evidence that a problem
exists that needs professional attention. Observation from multiple
perspectives is the most valid and reliable method for evaluating
children's emotional and behavioral status.

[p. <i>284</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00304&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• <i>Referral</i>


It is important to make appropriate referrals for additional
assessment and possible treatment when an emotional disturbance
has been identified in a maltreated child. Delayed or
avoided treatment leads only to more chronic problems that may
be more difficult to treat later. Resources for evaluation and
treatment of emotional disturbance include mental health professionals,
such as social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists.
Mental health clinics in the community and hospitals are good
sources to locate these resources. In addition, local school systems
can provide some resources because they are required by law to
evaluate and provide services for emotional disturbance, even for
preschool children. No matter what system is used for additional
assessment and intervention, it is important to use advocacy and
case management skills to continue to access appropriate services
for emotionally disturbed children and youth.


Direct methods used by professionals for assessing child and
adolescent emotional state include interviews with children and
self-report scales, such as the Children's Depression Inventory,
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and the Youth Self-Report
form of the Child Behavior Checklist. Difficulties with
interviews have been discussed previously: Children with emotional
disturbance may not be able to effectively communicate
their emotions. Self-report scales can be easy to administer and
very useful in the evaluation of adolescents. A problem with
self-report scales is their limitation with children younger than
age 10 in whom the ability to identify and self-report emotions
is not fully developed. Indirect methods for assessing child and
youth emotional state include projective tests such as drawings,
sentence completion tests, storytelling in response to pictures,
and interpretation of inkblot responses. These latter methods
require substantial clinical training and experience for accurate
administration and interpretation. Even with these skills, the
usefulness of these methods for evaluating children younger than
age 10 is uncertain.


Emotional state is one of the most complex aspects of children
and youth to accurately evaluate and treat. The ability to identify
emerging emotional problems and provide early intervention,
however, is critically important to preventing chronic, long-term
emotional disturbance and substantial disability. Given the high

? <i>Mental Health Effects of Child Abuse</i>


Recommendations for assessment of the clinical functioning of
maltreated children are guided by studies that identify the effects
of abuse. Several studies provide useful information about various
consequences of abuse and on a range of appropriate instruments
(see Kolko, 1996). Suggestions for assessing some common mental
health problems are described in this chapter.


? <i>General Assessment: Considerations and Issues</i>


Whenever possible, it is useful to collect information across a
range of topics from multiple sources, including child victims and
their siblings, caregivers and other adults in the home, teachers,
clinicians, and records. These efforts may complement one another
in highlighting different aspects of the precursors to or
impact of the abusive experience or both (e.g., risk factors,
clinical symptoms, and impaired functioning). Such information
may not only clarify the child's functioning but also serve as
outcome indicators (targets) to help document the impact of
intervention on a child's adjustment (e.g., medical status, social

[p. <i>287</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00307&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The use of different methods may enhance the overall utility
and accuracy of the assessment. Although most information is
obtained from parent interviews, it may also be collected using
child self-report instruments, structured diagnostic interviews,
and behavioral observation or ratings. The inclusion of multiple
informants, measures, and assessment methods may help develop
the most accurate and comprehensive understanding of an individual
case to guide an appropriate intervention.


? <i>Assessment of Specific Problems</i>


Many maltreated children have problems with physical aggression
and violent behavior, among other conduct problems, that
may lead to delinquent or even criminal activities. These problems
may manifest as physically coercive acts (e.g., fighting and
cruelty), persistent defiance (e.g., authority conflicts), or antisocial
behaviors that are concealed or "covert" (e.g., lying and
stealing). It is important to evaluate the frequency, severity, and
duration of such problems using parent or teacher questionnaires,
such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991)
and its associated measures -- the Teacher Report Form (TRF) and
the Youth Self-Report. These scales assess diverse behavioral and
emotional symptoms and social competency (social skills). Other
questions might examine the child's involvement in verbally and
physically aggressive behaviors (e.g., fighting and weapon use).
It may be helpful to obtain more specific information by asking
parents about the frequency and severity of individual behaviors
(e.g., fighting, stealing, and lying) within the past week.


Symptoms of hyperactivity and, specifically, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, often manifest as problems with attention,
impulse control, and overactivity. Generally, children receive the
diagnosis before the age of 7. Questions should be asked of
teachers and parents about the severity of these types of problems
relative to that of other children of the same age and developmental
level (e.g., "How excitable or impulsive is your child?"
and "Is he easily distracted?"). It is important to assess the effects
of the perceived hyperactivity at school and at home. If this
concern is raised, evaluation by a pediatrician or mental health
professional is recommended.

[p. <i>288</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00308&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Problematic social behavior and poor interpersonal skills
include poor peer relations and negative peer behaviors, limited
peer involvement and initiations during play sessions, and social
isolation. Specific social skills can be evaluated individually (e.g.,
"How well does he maintain conversations ... use polite language?"),
and peer relationships can be evaluated using the
previously mentioned scales (e.g., CBCL and TRF) or a few key
questions (e.g., "How many close friends does he have?" and
"How often does he get involved in social activities?"). Teachers
can help supplement an interview with behavioral observations
during social activities (e.g., recess).


Problems with self-esteem, depression, and anxiety, which
have been documented in high-risk samples, can be assessed
during child or parent interviews. Often, child interviews may
elicit feelings of sadness, a sense of lost pleasure in previously
enjoyable activities, feelings of hopelessness or distortions about
oneself or one's future, or all these, which should prompt additional
evaluation of suicidality (ideation, intent, and plans).
Specific items useful to evaluating severity of depressive symptoms
include the child's level of sadness, loss of interest in
preferred activities, irritability, physical complaints and loss of
energy or weight, guilt, and negative perceptions of oneself, the
world, and the future. Problems with anxiety may be manifested
by frequent worries, multiple fears, physiological symptoms related
to anxiety, and avoidance of specific situations or people.


Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related reactions are
important targets for clinical treatment that merit careful diagnostic
interviewing. Questions about scary events in the child's
life can determine whether a significant stressor has been experienced
and, if so, the severity of any resulting symptoms (e.g.,
hyperarousal and numbing). Certain instruments evaluate the
severity of these reactions, primarily in sexually abused children
-- for example, the Children's Impact of Traumatic Events
Scale-Revised (Wolfe, Gentile, Michienzi, Sas, &amp; Wolfe, 1991)
evaluates the severity of problems in four areas (e.g., PTSD-intrusive
thoughts), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children
(Briere, 1996) assesses depression, anxiety, posttraumatic
stress, dissociation, anger, and sexual concerns. These measures
may help to determine the severity of specific problems following
a physically abusive or traumatic experience.

[p. <i>289</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00309&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A child's mental health problems may be related to parent-child
conflict and family problems, which may be important to
evaluate from the child's perspective. These problems often are
reflected in hostile comments, lengthy arguments, and threatened
or actual physical altercations as well as reduced cohesion and
support among family members. Assessment can ascertain perceived
positive and negative characteristics of the parents and
family. Maltreated children may reside in families characterized
by limited parental supervision and positive discipline and inconsistent
or excessive use of harsh discipline, highlighting the need
to assess the caregiver's use of different management practices.
Other questions can supplement what is known about the family's
level of conflict and hostility or punitivenesss. Observations
of family interactions in the home may be especially helpful to
identify targets for intervention.


Of course, it is important to also determine positive family
influences. Thus, questions should be asked about the level of
children's social support from different sources (e.g., family,
teacher, and peers). Finally, aspects of the family environment,
such as warmth, cohesion, supportiveness, and expressiveness
(e.g., "How often do you do things together?"), are important to
assess. Understanding the family's relationships, activities, and
structure provides a helpful perspective regarding family influences
on the child's behavior.

Preventive pediatric and dental care for children and youth
is the keystone of efforts to ensure their health and wellbeing.
By ensure that such preventive care is received, problems
can be detected early and thus dealt with more effectively
and efficiently. The maintenance of an accurate record of a child's
well child care, in addition to illnesses, such as in a medical passport,
helps ensure that maltreated children receive appropriate
care. The ability of children to reach adulthood healthy and prepared
for the world they will face depends on such efforts.

? <i>Summary</i>


Although the previous discussion provided the recommendations
for preventive pediatric and dental care for all children and
youth, those that have been or are being maltreated, especially
neglected, may not have had the recommended care and thus
need "catch-up" visits. In addition, additional health problems in
these children may require more than the routine visits. An
appropriate catch-up schedule should be planned.

[p. <i>293</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00313&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Health includes physical, emotional, and dental status.
Primary health care screens children for potential problems
so as to intervene early and prevent problems from
occurring. It is thus important to assess whether the child has a
pediatric and a dental provider, and whether adequate care has
been received (see Chapter 60, this volume). The following are
of special interest:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Are immunizations up to date?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Were vision and hearing screens OK?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Were there any concerns regarding development or mental
health?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Were other problems noted (e.g., anemia, lead poisoning,
and sickle cell disease)?
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• Are immunizations up to date?


• Were vision and hearing screens OK?


• Were there any concerns regarding development or mental
health?


• Were other problems noted (e.g., anemia, lead poisoning,
and sickle cell disease)?


The previous information may be available from the child and
parent, but contact with the primary health care provider should
provide useful information. If adequate primary care has not been
obtained, there may be important gaps (e.g., immunizations),
making it difficult to be sure of the child's health status.

[p. <i>294</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00314&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If health problems have been identified, one needs to know
the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The cause(s)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Its severity (e.g., how often does it affect the child?)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How it affects the child (e.g., can the child play sports, go
to school, and do most things?)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• What treatment is needed
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Is the treatment being fully implemented? (If not, why
not?)
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• The cause(s)


• Its severity (e.g., how often does it affect the child?)


• How it affects the child (e.g., can the child play sports, go
to school, and do most things?)


• What treatment is needed


• Is the treatment being fully implemented? (If not, why
not?)


Some problems are minor (e.g., occasional ear infections) and
need limited care; others are more serious and have lifelong
implications (e.g., diabetes). It is important to recognize that the
same disease can affect children very differently; for example,
asthma can be a daily problem or cause symptoms every few years.
Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the condition affects
the child. It is useful to know the extent to which the treatment
enables the child to function well, free of symptoms. For example,
medications may fully control a seizure disorder, allowing the
child to do most things. It should be recognized that physical
problems may affect emotional health and vice versa. Mind and
body are surely connected. Thus, serious and chronic diseases
raise concerns about a child's mental health. Much of this information
may be available from the child and parent, but clarification
with the health care provider is recommended.


Health problems may not have been identified, especially if
health care has been inadequate. Screening can be done by asking
the child and parent whether they have any health problems:
<blockquote>
<p>
For children: "Is there anything about your health or body
that bothers you?"
</p>
<p>
For parents: "How would you rate your child's health--
excellent, good, fair, or poor?"
</p>
</blockquote>


For children: "Is there anything about your health or body
that bothers you?"


For parents: "How would you rate your child's health--
excellent, good, fair, or poor?"


"Fair" or "poor" are red flags that additional evaluation is
needed. There are several brief questionnaires that professionals
can use for assessing children's behavior (see Chapter 56, this
volume). Sometimes, health problems can be observed (e.g., a
disfiguring burn and a sad, withdrawn child). Caseworkers and

[p. <i>295</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00315&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A child's functioning reflects his or her health status. The
following are some useful questions:


Regarding physical health:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can he or she perform developmentally appropriate activities
of daily living (e.g., dress himself or herself and
climb stairs)?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can the child play sports?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Can the child attend school regularly?

</td></tr>
</table>

Regarding emotional health:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• How does the child get along with others--at home, at
school, and in the neighborhood?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>

Regarding dental health:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Does the child have a toothache?
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• When was the last time the child saw a dentist? (After age
3, the child should be checked every year.)
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Such questions provide a screening of a child's functioning and
health status. Possible problems will often require additional
evaluation.


• Does the child have a toothache?


• When was the last time the child saw a dentist? (After age
3, the child should be checked every year.)


The previous picture may be drawn mostly by talking with
the child and parents. Talking to the child's health care provider,
however, is strongly recommended. Other professionals (e.g.,
teachers and therapists) may also add valuable information.
Caseworkers might explain that their work includes ensuring that
children are being adequately cared for. Caseworkers may also
have concerns or information that are important to convey to
health professionals. Periodic communication between caseworkers
and health care providers is valuable, with the frequency
tailored to the specific circumstances. By sharing information and

[p. <i>296</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00316&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Children involved with child protective services, especially
those who have been in substitute care, may have had health care
from multiple providers. It can be extremely helpful if the
caseworker collects information from those who have been substantially
involved, particularly primary care providers, to develop
a relatively complete record of the child's health. This does
require a considerable effort to first obtain the names of health
care providers from the family, and in some instances permission
to contact them, but it can be very worthwhile. Several states have
implemented "health passports" as a medical record for children
in foster care to have a comprehensive view and to improve the
health care of these high-risk children.

[p. <i>297</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00317&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The support that children receive in their natural social
networks contributes significantly to treatment outcomes
when children are victims of maltreatment and to the
prevention of future abuse or neglect because social support
offers children many human resources. Social support provides
counseling and emotional nurturance that are important to psychological
healing. Also, it provides access to information, services,
and material assistance that children may need. Children
are unlikely to be aware of possible therapeutic aid, social services,
or school support, or to ask for and obtain such assistance,
without the help of adults. Social support may be instrumental in
developmental remediation and skill acquisition, particularly in
areas in which psychosocial growth is impaired by abuse or
neglect. Supportive adults can serve as substitute attachment
figures, for example, and contribute to improving social skills
deficits and damaged self-esteem. Social support networks are
also important to the prevention of future maltreatment, especially
as adults assume responsibility for monitoring children's
well-being. For these reasons, understanding children's social
support networks (especially from the child's perspective) is an
important therapeutic and preventive goal.

[p. <i>298</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00318&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An important step in understanding children's social support
networks is appreciating the nature of the networks and how they
change with development:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Children's social networks are less extensive than those
of adults, especially early in life when their primary social
relationships are within the family. Even after their social
networks have expanded with day care, preschool, and
primary and secondary school relationships, the family
remains central to social support. Although this is a
problem when family life is abusive or traumatizing (although
siblings can be supportive), it is important to
remember that during most periods of early life children
also have relationships outside the home in day care or
school, with extended family members, in neighborhood
activities, or in after-school programs. Identifying where
a child perceives that social support might be found
outside the home is important.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Children's social networks overlap with those of their
parents. Family friends, neighborhood associations, extended
family relationships, and church and recreational
contacts are shared by parents and offspring. Moreover,
parents are often mediators of their children's social
networks through their willingness to plan, schedule, and
arrange transportation for offspring. Thus, social support
to children often must occur indirectly through their
parents.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>

attachment figures for younger children.

What is the best way to assess children's perceptions of their
support systems? In general, a two-step process is required: (1)
assessing the breadth of a child's social network (i.e., who is the
child regularly in contact with?) and (2) assessing how supportive
these people are from the child's perspective. It is also often
helpful to distinguish different forms of support (e.g., emotional

[p. <i>299</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00319&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Depending on the child's age, various approaches can be
considered. Specific questions can be used to probe the kinds of
support older children experience in different relationships (e.g.,
"Are there people to whom you talk about really important
things?" and "Are there people who make you feel good or
special?"). A series of concentric circles can be used to "map"
younger children's perceptions of their closeness to various people
in their networks (with the innermost circle representing
"people who are most close and important to you" and so forth).
Once the breadth of a child's support network has been identified,
ranking procedures can be used to indicate the one or two
people who are most important to the child when help is needed.
Sometimes, simple and straightforward inquiries (e.g., "If you
needed help, who would you ask?") can accomplish the same
goal. Visual aids (such as a schematic thermometer with increasing
levels indicating how much emotional support, companionship,
and tangible assistance children believe they receive from
specific people in their networks) can be especially helpful with
younger children. Also helpful would be a walk around the child's
neighborhood and other familiar settings coupled with specific
questions about who the child knows, what kinds of experiences
he or she has shared with these partners, and who would the child
turn to if he or she needed help. There are also standardized
questionnaires and rating instruments that can be used with older
children (Belle, 1989).

Visitation with their birth family is a core service for
children in out-of-home care. Many foster parents and
group care providers report that children present challenging
behaviors before, during and after visitation. Therefore,
assessing children's behavior related to visitation is critical in
permanency planning. This chapter provides examples of typical
behavioral problems related to visitation, underlying feelings and
issues to explore, and strategies to use in assessing these behaviours
and issues.


? <i>Typical Behavioral Problems and
Underlying Feelings and Issues to Explore</i>


It is important to individualize children who are in care and
understand that they have their own histories and needs. There
are some behaviors, however, that commonly occur with regard
to visitation and separation, and it is helpful to be prepared to
assess for these. For instance, many children have sleep problems,

[p. <i>301</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00321&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hostile behaviors, both physical and verbal, are very common
in children at visitation times. When hostile behaviors are seen,
it is useful to consider whether the child might be expressing
feelings of anger or feelings of loss. Both anger and loss are
powerful and scary feelings for children--and for adults--so it is
not surprising that these are sometimes expressed in behavior.


Another possible issue to be explored is whether the child is
attempting to cause the foster parents to reject him or her in hopes
of being returned. Finally, posttraumatic stress should again be
considered.


Many children in care act inconsistently. For instance, sometimes
they may have mood or behavioral swings. Possible underlying
issues for these behaviors include uncertainty about the
future, confusion, and lack of trust.


Many foster parents have indicated that they are very challenged
by children who lie and-steal. These behaviors may be
related to children's hopes that, if they misbehave, they will be
returned. These behaviors could also indicate anger, lack of trust,
or low self-esteem.


Some foster children are overly affectionate. This may be
assessed as regression to an earlier developmental stage due to
anxiety or to wanting to be seen positively. Other foster children
may be described as pseudomature; they seem old beyond their
years. These children may be trying to assert some control in their
lives, may be fearful of getting close emotionally to the foster
parents, may be rejecting the need for birth parents, or may be
reenacting previous roles played in their birth families.


Finally, it is also common for foster children to run away or
act withdrawn at times of visitation. When children run away,
they may be depressed, feel overwhelmed, or be trying to assert
some control over their lives. When children act withdrawn, they
may be feeling hopeless, depressed, or having posttraumatic stress
symptoms.

? <i>A Case</i>


Mrs. R. is a single 22-year-old mother of three children, boys
ages 6 and 4 and a 2-month-old girl. A neighbor alleges that
the boys are unkempt, unsupervised, and approach strangers
for food. At an initial unannounced visit on a summer day, a
child protection worker found Mrs. R. watching TV inside a
sparsely furnished apartment with the baby asleep next to her
on the couch. Mrs. R. stated she was unaware of the whereabouts
of her boys, who were found outside playing together.
When questioned, the older boy reported he last ate yesterday
evening and last bathed several days ago. The younger boy
did not respond to questions. Mrs. R. said he rarely talked
and knew only a few dozen words. For food, Mrs. R. had
only three cans of soup in the apartment. She reported she
was breast-feeding the baby. Mrs. R. denied any drug or
alcohol use but reported she had been feeling "down" for
several months and that she knew she had not been caring
well for her family. The child protection worker took the
family to a nearby food pantry, helped Mrs. R. make a
doctor's appointment for the baby, and scheduled a time the
next day to talk further with Mrs. R. Mrs. R. said she would
welcome additional help.

? <i>The Caregiver's History</i>


Information about the parents' past can provide valuable clues
about the kinds of interventions that will best help them protect
their children. Ideally, a child protection worker will complete a
thorough social assessment and history of each family, including
a thorough history of each parent or caregiver. It has been said
that if one does not know what to do with a family, one has not
done a thorough assessment. Important aspects of a caregiver's
history include special events in childhood, relationships with
caregiver's parents and extended family, and health, romantic,
employment, education, and legal history.


A helpful way to gather this information is to draw a family
genogram with the family. The genogram is a visual depiction of
the family tree with some additional vital information, such as
important dates, employment, brief personality descriptions, and
a visual depiction of who gets along with whom. A limited
genogram of Mrs. R.'s family is shown in Appendix 6. Details on
how to draw a genogram are provided by McGoldrick and
Gerson (1985).


The genogram allows you to learn a great amount about a
family in a short time and provides a reason to ask important
questions about personal history. If used correctly, it also helps
build a working relationship with parents. Parents may be pleased
to have been assigned a child protection worker who has taken
the time to understand their social reality. By the time the
genogram is completed, confusing parent and child behaviors
may make sense when seen in the context of personal history.


An advantage of the genogram is that it forces the child
protection worker to specifically ask about the parent's relatives,
relationships with romantic partners or other parents of the
children, and families. Thus, the child protection worker is not
only assessing family history but also the social support available
from family members and potential placement resources if
needed later. Regarding Mrs. R.'s family, she has a sister who may
serve as a placement resource and a source of support, but in
general she is isolated from her family.


Many aspects of a parent's past can affect how he or she cares
for his or her children. Many of these can be assessed while

[p. <i>307</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00327&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For parents struggling to care for their children, one should
explore memories of how they were cared for when they were
children. Does Mrs. R. remember being hungry and there being
no food to eat? At what age was she allowed to go unsupervised?
For other families, questions about how the parent was disciplined
might be the most crucial. Mrs. R.'s genogram shows that
she does not believe her mother did a good job raising her. She
felt neglected and uncared for and remembers being teased at
school for having dirty clothes. This might suggest to a worker
that Mrs. R. has never learned how to supervise children and that
her family may not be supportive in helping her make parenting
changes.


Do not feel compelled to find a "smoking gun" in a caregiver's
past. Child maltreatment is caused by multiple factors. It is a myth
that every maltreating parent has been maltreated.

[p. <i>308</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00328&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>It Is Not What Is in Your History
But, Rather, What You Think About It</i>


Be careful how you interpret the information you obtain about a
family member's history. None of us are doomed to repeat the
mistakes of our parents. Research on a variety of family problems
has concluded that most people who experience a problem in
their family of origin do not re-create the same problem in their
family of creation, although they are at greater risk than others
of doing so. In other words, most children of alcoholics do not
become alcoholics, although they are at a greater risk of becoming
alcoholics than those people who did not have a parent who was
an alcoholic.


Research rooted in attachment theory suggests that parents
who can think about their difficult childhood experiences coherently,
and who talk about the negative ways in which they were
affected by their parents' actions, often raise securely attached
children. In other words, parents who understand their history
can work to ensure better environments for their children.


? <i>Signs That Caregivers Understand
Their Painful Histories</i>


• Express how they were harmed by maltreatment received
as children: These parents may recognize how their children
are being harmed.


• Talk about how they wished things would have been
different when they were children: These parents may be
willing to make changes in their own lives to help their
children.


• Motivated to avoid mistakes of own parents: For example,
some children of alcoholics purposefully abstain from
alcohol so that their spouse and children avoid the horrors
they experienced. If Mrs. R. can express what it was
like to feel neglected by a depressed mother, she may be
more likely to seek help for her own depression.

? <i>Red Flags That Suggest a Caregiver's
Past Is Hindering the Ability to Parent</i>


• Not being able to talk about painful childhood experiences:
These parents may deny or avoid thinking about
the maltreatment their children are receiving because
acknowledging their children's pain may mean having to
acknowledge their own.


• Denying that the maltreatment they experienced as children
had any effect on their development: These parents
may think that their children will be unaffected by the
maltreatment they are receiving.


• Idealizing a perpetrator of abuse: If parents overlook their
parents' troubling behaviors, they may be willing to overlook
their own.


• Excusing the behavior of an adult who mistreated them
or saying that they deserved the maltreatment they received:
These parents may be willing to excuse the behavior
of other perpetrators, or they may distort their current
situation to think that their children deserve the maltreatment
they are receiving.


Parents exhibiting the previous behaviors may benefit from
psychotherapy to help them process their childhood experiences
and see how these have had an impact on their development and
the parenting of their children. Unfortunately, parents who deny
or distort their history may also be the most resistant to treatment.
They may fear confronting a painful past. It may be helpful to
point out, as concretely as possible, the effects that current
behaviors are having on the development of their children.

The key to effective service planning with parents is a
careful assessment of their attitudes, knowledge, and level
of functioning, as well as the other intrapsychic and
behavioral disturbances and contextual factors that may interfere
with the use of skills of parents. This information facilitates
targeting treatment, monitoring progress, and adjusting services
as needed. It also allows for documentation of final outcomes that
are useful for decision making (e.g., termination of parental
rights, reunification) and for examining more general program
effectiveness. <i>Assessment of attitudes and behavioral skills in
specific domains of parenting</i> (e.g., medical care knowledge and
the ability to provide cognitive stimulation) and of <i>cross-domain
capacities</i> (e.g., interpersonal problem solving, perspective-taking)
are needed.


Before discussing specific techniques, a brief discussion is
needed regarding professional resistance to conducting assessments
(e.g., concerns that it will damage the relationship; needs
will be identified that cannot be handled, such as suicidality; and
lack of progress will be used against them or their agency). Some
concerns may have validity, but others may not. For example,

[p. <i>311</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00331&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A framework (i.e., the areas crucial to assess) is needed to
structure the selection of the assessment method(s). The assessment
of level of functioning refers to what parents do in various
domains (e.g., how they diaper an infant, carry out discipline of
a 4-year-old, or deal with a teenager's violating a curfew). In
contrast, assessment of attitudes and knowledge has more to do
with the foundation of information and beliefs on which a parent
draws to perform the functions of parenting. For example, parents
may try to keep teenagers at home to listen to their problems,
instead of letting them be with peers, because they believe this is
what teenagers <i>should</i> do. Also, they may spank a 3-year-old for
not staying out of their way when they are in a bad mood, if they
believe that 3-year-olds are capable of perspective taking.


Given the heterogeneity of parental deficits, it is difficult to
provide a single assessment strategy. Capacities to complete basic
survival tasks, handle emergencies, and provide for a child's
developmental needs require attention. Common areas that require
attention are noted in Table A7.2 of Appendix 7, and
methods for collecting this information are outlined in the following
sections.


? <i>Informal Interviews and Observations</i>


In talking with parents, one should pay careful attention to their
spontaneous narratives regarding children for indicators of <i>disturbed
attitudes or beliefs regarding both their children and their
role as parents</i>. Examples of distortions in such narratives include
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Assumptions of mind reading (e.g., "He <i>knew</i> I was
tired.")
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
</p><p>[p. <i>312</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00332&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
• Evidence of attributional biases (e.g., "He's that way--
he's selfish" and "She knew it would get to me.")
</td></tr></table>

• Assumptions of mind reading (e.g., "He <i>knew</i> I was
tired.")



[p. <i>312</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00332&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• A sense of low self-efficacy as a parent (e.g., "She thinks
she's boss" and "He thinks I'm stupid.")


• Indications of spillover of negative affect from other
relationships (e.g., "He's just like his father--no good!")


When questioning a parent regarding problems with his or her
child (e.g., crying, tantrums), a set of specific questions can also
sometimes uncover distortions in the parent's perceptions. For
example, a parent might be questioned in the following way
regarding his or her response to a tantrum:
<blockquote>
<p>
Worker: All mothers get upset at tantrums, but for all
mothers it is different. What about it was the
hardest part for you?
</p>
<p>
Mother: He thinks he's boss.
</p>
<p>
Worker: What about being a mother of a child who thinks
he's boss is the hardest part for you?
</p>
<p>
Mother: He thinks I am stupid.
</p>
<p>
Worker: Feeling that way must be awful! Are there other
people who make you feel this way?
</p>
<p>
Mother: He's just like his father. He was always calling me
"dummy"!
</p>
</blockquote>
For this mother, her history with men and low sense of self-efficacy
emerge in difficult transactions with her son. These might
be dealt with in addition to providing skills on how to handle
tantrums.


Worker: All mothers get upset at tantrums, but for all
mothers it is different. What about it was the
hardest part for you?


Mother: He thinks he's boss.


Worker: What about being a mother of a child who thinks
he's boss is the hardest part for you?


Mother: He thinks I am stupid.


Worker: Feeling that way must be awful! Are there other
people who make you feel this way?


Mother: He's just like his father. He was always calling me
"dummy"!


In visits with families, informal observations can be collected
on the quality of parent-child interactions. Recording of behaviors
across visits may identify patterns of responding that are
problematic (e.g., poor stress management, inability to negotiate
conflict, failure to identify safety risks, and little use of positive
approaches). During interactions, questions regarding parents'
beliefs and thought patterns can also be solicited (e.g., "I just saw
Johnny have trouble with following your commands. Why do
you think that is?").

[p. <i>313</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00333&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Structured Assessments</i>


Although informal interviews and observations can be useful,
structured methods can provide a broader and more thorough
coverage and, in some cases, norms against which to measure the
meaning of parents' responses. Interview protocols, self-report
instruments, and formal observational schemas exist for many of
the domains noted in Table A7.2 in Appendix 7. Some cautions
are in order, however. Most have limited psychometric data (e.g.,
norms, versions in different languages, and validity data with
large samples and with diverse sets of parents). Given that parents
involved with child protective services (CPS) are also under legal
constraints, they may not respond honestly. Also, if parents have
lost child custody, the lack of contact may affect their responses.
Finally, our ability to predict future violence has been questioned.
Nonetheless, the available methods can provide a useful starting
point.


Promising approaches exist, including self-report measures
for parenting beliefs and knowledge, measures of problem-solving
capacities, and ones assessing cognitive distortions regarding
children (although the latter are less well developed) (see
Appendix 7 for sample measures). Many have subscales measuring
domains of parenting and the level of child risk. Some have
norms on parents who have been involved with CPS.


Behavioral protocols exist that might be adapted for observations
of parent-child interaction (Marsh, 1991; Appendix 7).
There are several ways to approach these observations (e.g., home
vs. clinic setting; structured vs. "naturalistic" interactions). Specific
common aversive child-rearing and child care situations can
be presented, and parents can be asked to enact them with their
children or role-play how they typically handle these situations.
Both their thinking in the midst of such difficulties and weaknesses
in their strategies can be examined. The situations you
present may vary with the developmental level of the child (e.g.,
feeding, handling of noncompliance, supervision, disagreements
with partners, and problems with teachers). Care must be taken
to obtain an adequate sample of interactions. Indices of parental
behavior derived from single, short samples (e.g., 45 minutes)

[p. <i>314</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00334&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Neglect Issues</i>


Neglect is an important area of assessment. It should include
direct parenting judgment and behavior (e.g., handling of emergencies)
and indirect choices that parents make regarding the
environment in which they raise their children (e.g., home safety)
(Appendix 7). For the latter, caution must be used because
poverty often determines whether parents do in fact have choices.


? <i>Assessment of Parent Resources and
Liabilities and Critical Contextual Factors</i>


Parents may also have skill deficits that interfere with treatment
or other problems that interfere with the optimal use of their
parenting capacities. For example, literacy is needed to read
prescription labels or to use parent education materials; thus, an
assessment of basic reading and writing is important. Psychiatric
problems can also interfere with parenting (e.g., depression), and
using screening instruments can determine treatment needs (see
Appendix 7 for sample measures).


Parenting involves a match between the parent's capacities
and the child's needs. Thus, an assessment of child functioning
may be useful. Common screening instruments can be administered,
and referrals can be made as needed for more detailed
evaluations. Broad-spectrum and narrowband (e.g., attention
problems, trauma) screening instruments are available. Because

[p. <i>315</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00335&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Parents function best under low contextual stress and with
high levels of positive social support. Thus, assessing these two
contextual factors is crucial. The number and type of stressful
events (e.g., daily hassles vs. life events) and the parents' perception
of the intensity of these events need to be considered.
Selecting instruments that fit parents' social class and life circumstances
is important. Assessing social support includes collecting
data on the size of parents' social networks, the amount of
contact, the valence (positive or negative) of that contact, and the
satisfaction with the support provided. Potential instruments are
listed in Appendix 7.


? <i>Cultural Context</i>


In performing evaluations, variation in cultural practices should
be considered. For example, high parental control may be viewed
negatively in one culture but signify caring in another. Culture
may also influence the meaning of social cues (e.g., children
turning eyes downward when speaking to adults may be mistakenly
seen as fear when it may signify respect). (For additional
information, see Chapters 9, 20, 48, and 71, this volume.)

All children with chronic health problems must have an
identified source of primary medical care. To assess
whether the care provided is adequate, the worker must
first be aware of the needs of the child. Talking with the child's
primary care provider will clarify the child's condition, needs,
and treatment as well as impressions of how the family is coping.
The family's perception of the situation can then be assessed.
Identifying barriers to care helps guide appropriate intervention.

Assessing the strengths and needs of caregivers is a joint
process that requires establishing rapport with caregivers
as the critical first step to gathering information needed
to ensure the child's safety and to help the caregivers change the
behaviors or conditions that are related to the risk of maltreatment.
Child protection agencies tend to be problem focused. As
a result, many workers focus on identifying, categorizing, and
labeling what is wrong with parents, their weaknesses, and their
limitations. It is clear that all human beings have strengths.
Workers must determine these by examining the whole person.
They must identify the behaviors or conditions of the caregivers
that must change to reduce or eliminate the risk of maltreatment,
and they must also search for the caregivers' strengths that will
provide the foundation on which change can occur.


? <i>Domains of Information</i>


The domains of information gathering necessary to identify the
caregivers' strengths and treatment needs include the following:

[p. <i>321</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00341&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• <i>Physical health:</i> Are the caregivers physically healthy? Do
they have any illnesses or conditions that may impact their
ability to provide care and nurturing for their children?


• <i>Psychological functioning and emotional expression:</i> Are
the caregivers emotionally healthy? Do they have a good
self-concept? Are the caregivers likable and honest? Are
the caregivers able to express love and affection to their
children? Do they have any psychological problems, and,
if so, what is the extent of these problems? Do they have
good coping skills? Are they able to control their feelings,
thoughts, and impulses?


• <i>Cognitive functioning:</i> What are the caregivers' levels of
intellectual functioning? Do they have any limitations
that may impact on their care of the child? Are the
caregivers able to accurately assess the situations in which
they find themselves? Do the caregivers have insight?
How would you describe the caregivers' problem-solving
abilities?


• <i>Social functioning and interpersonal relationships:</i> Do the
caregivers have positive and healthy relationships with
adults (family and friends) outside the home? Are the
caregivers able to form trusting relationships with others?
How would you characterize the nature of the caregivers'
relationships? Are they characterized by openness, help,
and support?


• <i>Childhood history:</i> Did the caregivers grow up in nurturing
and loving environments? Were the caregivers' childhood
experiences fraught with trauma, abuse, or
deprivation?


? <i>Identifying the Caregiver's Strengths</i>


The fundamental skills of identifying, respecting, and making use
of people's strengths and resources must be emphasized in the
assessment of caregivers' strengths and treatment needs. By
searching for strengths and abilities, the worker is identifying
something powerful in the caregivers as well as something often
neglected. The following strategies can assist in identifying caregivers'
strengths:

[p. <i>322</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00342&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Move beyond the behavior contributing to the risk of
maltreatment and search for the purpose or positive
intention behind it. Workers must believe that all behavior
is purposeful, it meets a need in the individual, and it has
healthy intention behind it. For example, a father who
was physically abused injures his 4-year-old son, who has
been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and engages in destructive and aggressive behavior.
The father loves his son and is trying to control his son's
behavior so that he will develop into a healthy functioning
adult.


• Discuss the caregivers' interests, likes, and abilities. Listen
to how the caregivers talk about everyday things. Ask
what they do for fun. Thoroughly examine all parts of the
caregivers' lives to find hidden strengths.


• Find out the caregivers' hopes and dreams. Ask them what
they want out of life. Ask them where they would like to
be in 5 years. Ask about what they hope for their family
and their children.


• Caregivers who abuse or neglect their children or both
have often survived abuse, neglect, trauma, or deprivation
as children and many other difficulties as adults. Therefore,
determine what personal qualities they have that
helped them survive.


• Everyone has had times in their lives when things were
going well. Ask parents the following: "Think of a time
when things were going well. What was different? How
would you describe what was different this morning when
you didn't have a drink?" This helps identify abilities
successfully used in one situation that could be used to
address other problems. (For more examples, see Chapter
19, this volume.)


? <i>Determining What Behaviors or
Conditions the Caregivers Must Change</i>


Determining what must change to reduce or eliminate the risk of
maltreatment requires an analysis of the information regarding
the caregivers' physical health; their psychological, social, and

[p. <i>323</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00343&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Which of the caregivers' behaviors or conditions are
contributing to the risk of maltreatment? (The intent is to
move beyond the symptoms.)


• What do the caregivers need to do to change the behaviors
or conditions? For example, in a case of sexual abuse, the
nonoffending mother may need to work through her own
victimization to fully meet her daughter's need to be
believed and emotionally supported.


• How pervasive is the problem? How many aspects of the
caregivers' lives do the problems or conditions affect?


• How serious is the problem?


• How long has the problem been occurring?


• Are the caregivers capable of changing the problem or
condition?


? <i>Summary</i>


To identify caregivers' strengths, workers must first believe that
all human beings have strengths. It is the worker's role to help
caregivers discover the strengths they can tap into to help them
change the behaviors or conditions that contribute to the risk of
maltreatment.

All human beings are motivated to meet basic needs. Clients
frequently differ in their state of readiness or eagerness
to change, however. Also, their readiness to change may
fluctuate from one time or situation to another. Motivation is
clearly linked to the degree of hope that change is possible. Part
of our role in assessing motivation is to foster hope through the
development of a helping relationship (see Chapter 8, this volume).
Thus, although this chapter is concerned with assessing
motivation, it is also about enhancing motivation.


How do we know when caregivers are motivated to change?
Is it because they agree that they need help? Is it because they
attended a parent education class? Is it because they appear to be
distressed by their current situation? The degree to which clients
are ready to change varies over time and has been described as
following a pattern:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Precontemplation: not seeing any need to change
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Contemplation: considering change but also rejecting it
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. Determination: wants to do something about the problem
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. Action: takes steps to change
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
5. Maintenance: maintains goal achievement
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
6. Relapse: recurrence of some earlier problems
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

This chapter provides a brief outline of areas that will inform
the practitioner's assessment of a client's readiness to enter into,
continue, and adhere to specific change strategies.


? <i>Assessing Comfort With the Status Quo</i>


Although occasionally families come to us through a self-referral,
most of the time our first contact with a family occurs because
someone else was concerned and made a referral. Thus, information
suggested about the engagement process (see Chapters 7
through 12, this volume) must be considered before we can make
an accurate assessment of a caregiver's comfort with the status
quo. The best strategy for assessing the degree of comfort with
the status quo is to help all family members talk about their daily
lives and their degree of satisfaction with their current situation.
Part of our goal is to raise doubt "that everything is OK" and help
caregivers recognize the consequences of current behaviors or
conditions that may contribute to maltreatment. Although they
may not initially listen to you as an outsider, they might be
convinced when they hear their children talk about how scared
they are when they are left alone at night.


? <i>Assessing the Degree of Hope
That the Situation Can Be Different</i>


As suggested previously, motivation is very much affected by
hope. It is important that we assess the client's hope that the
situation can be different by what they say, by what we observe,
and by what they do. It is also important that we recognize that
sometimes clients are incapacitated by conditions that need to be
addressed first (e.g., depression). It is easier to pursue a goal (even
if one is unhappy with the status quo) if one has faith that the
goal can be achieved. One method to encourage hope is to follow
the suggestions offered in Chapter 19 (i.e., help family members
identify the exceptions). For example, sometimes families need
considerable help to remember the times when things were better
or to create a picture of what their life could look like with fewer
stresses and strains. Sometimes it is difficult to convey hope that
things can be different because clients have had negative experiences
with formal systems and cannot imagine that a worker
could actually want to work with them, not against them. Nevertheless,

[p. <i>326</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00346&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Assessing Motivation and Values</i>


To sustain change, goals must be consistent with a person's values
and culture, and we should not try to impose our values on others
(see Chapter 20, this volume). Sometimes, however, we may be
able to offer a broader vision of ways of being. For example, if
having a clean house is not something the caregiver thinks is very
important, it may be necessary for the worker to understand what
value the caregiver may have that may reinforce a goal to keep a
child's environment healthy (e.g., "Every time one of the kids get
sick, everyone ends up getting sick. I know it's no fun taking care
of sick kids all of the time"). Also, if the caregiver dropped out
of school in the eighth grade, he or she may not believe that to
succeed in life children should do well in school. To construct
goals that will be achieved, we need to better understand our
clients' values and beliefs. Family members are the best source of
this information.


? <i>Assessing Whether Wants and Goals Are Realistic</i>


A very important role that we play in the assessment process is
understanding what the caregiver wants to change and whether
this view of the future is realistic and achievable. Some caregivers
want to work on goals that exceed their capacity (e.g., seek career
goals that are beyond their personal aptitude). Other caregivers
might suggest goals that are beyond the sphere of influence of the
caregivers and the worker--for example, interest in their children
having no contact with their father ever again). If there is nothing
to suggest that the children are unsafe when they are with their
father, it is unrealistic that this goal could ever be achieved. We
want to encourage self-determination, which fosters motivation;
we do not want to contribute to a caregiver's failure, however,
by knowingly developing plans that are unrealistic.

[p. <i>327</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00347&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Assessing Strength of Motivation</i>


Sometimes, caregivers express an interest in change, but because
their view of the problem is different from ours, they may not
have the willingness or skills to fully engage in the process. For
example, a caregiver might state,
<blockquote>
<p>
It is OK if you see my daughter, Malinda, so she learns how
<i>not</i> to talk back to me, but I really don't have any time for
this stuff.... I have to hold down two jobs plus take care of
these kids and the house.
</p>
</blockquote>


It is OK if you see my daughter, Malinda, so she learns how
<i>not</i> to talk back to me, but I really don't have any time for
this stuff.... I have to hold down two jobs plus take care of
these kids and the house.


Alternatively, a caregiver might say, "I'll do whatever that court
order says, and then I want my kids back but I don't have time
to go to the school and talk with Eugene's teacher." Part of our
goal in the assessment process is to assess not only what a
caregiver says he or she is willing to do but also what he or she
is unwilling to do. Sometimes, when we detect weak motivation,
it may be because of a disparity in one of the other assessment
areas (e.g., the caregivers feel OK with the status quo, do not
really have hope that things can be different, are being asked to
do things that are inconsistent with their values, or have unrealistic
ideas about how things can be better).


? <i>Summary</i>


Motivation is much more than compliance with a court order or
service plan. Even if a caregiver acknowledges the need for help,
we may observe ambivalence or actual avoidance of the difficult
tasks required to actually change long-standing behaviors or
conditions. As noted in Chapter 11, caregivers that are the easiest
to work with may actually be less motivated to change. Caregivers
who initially react negatively to our intervention (see Chapters
10 and 11, this volume), however, may have the most potential
to change. Assessment of motivation is complex and begins with
the first contact and continues throughout the change process.

Currently, the most common life-threatening diagnoses in
a young adult are HIV infection and cancer. The general
facts presented in this chapter regarding HIV infection
may be helpful when you are dealing with an HIV-positive
caregiver. AIDS is caused by HIV Being infected with HIV does
not mean that the person has AIDS. Also, AIDS is a syndrome
that develops when the immune system is no longer able to
function effectively in preventing illnesses that the body can
normally resist.


<i>Signs of AIDS in Adults</i>


Early signs are nonspecific and can include swollen glands,
tiring easily, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and diarrhea. The
most common AIDS-associated condition in both women and
men is a serious lung infection called <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia.

[p. <i>330</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00350&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Women and AIDS</i>
</b>


• Women are usually the primary caregivers of their children,
and illness related to HIV or AIDS can affect their ability to
care for their children because of hospitalizations, debilitation,
and central nervous system disease.


• Early diagnosis of HIV is important: The only way to determine
if a person is infected with HIV is with a blood test.
Survival time for women is shorter than that for men because
women often are not diagnosed early and therefore do not
receive treatment early. Compared to men, HIV-infected
women have less access to care and poorer use of health care
resources.


• Domestic violence, homelessness, and lack of social support
for women may be important factors. Therefore, it is important
to identify infected women as soon as possible and enroll them
in a comprehensive health care program.


• The following are common problems in women with AIDS:
esophageal candidiasis (yeast), herpes simplex virus, esophagitis,
bacterial pneumonia, vaginal infections, pelvic inflammatory
disease, and menstrual irregularity.


<b>
<i>Life Expectancy</i>
</b>


Average time between infection with HIV and onset of clinically
apparent disease is approximately 10 years. A small percentage
of infected individuals die within months following infection,
and approximately 5% have no signs of disease even after 12
years. With the new multiple-drug treatment, life expectancy is
expected to increase considerably.


<b>
<i>Health Care Needs</i>
</b>


All HIV-infected individuals must have primary health care
provided by staff knowledgeable of HIV and AIDS.

[p. <i>331</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00351&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>New Advances in Treatment of HIV Infection</i>
</b>


Major advances in assessing the severity of HIV infection and
in treatment have occurred. Tests such as the viral load have
shown how high levels of virus correlate with worsening clinical
course. Patients with AIDS have a larger amount of the virus than
do asymptomatic patients. Decrease in viral load due to treatment
is strongly correlated with improved clinical outcome.


<b>
<i>Current Recommendations for Treatment</i>
</b>


The current recommendations are based on the very poor
prognosis of untreated HIV The HIV virus can becomes resistant
to antiviral drugs, especially if the drugs are not taken as recommended,
requiring excellent compliance with treatment. Therefore,
the long-term suppression of viral growth and preventing
resistance can only be achieved with combinations of medications,
known as "highly active antiretroviral therapy."


• Effective antiviral treatment should be introduced before extensive
immune system damage has occurred.


• Viral load monitoring is an essential tool to determine the risk
of disease progression and response to antiviral therapy.


• A combination of antiviral drugs should be used to suppress
HIV replication to below detection level by sensitive viral load
tests.


• Education and support should be provided to patients to
achieve compliance with complicated treatment using combination
antiviral therapy.


<b>
<i>Counseling and Support</i>
</b>


Knowledge that one is infected with HIV is emotionally
devastating to most individuals and often to the family. Stresses
experienced by affected families include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Separation, grieving, loss (e.g., placement of children in substitute
care, loss of function, and death), and depression
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Stigma, guilt, ostracism, and secrecy

• Alteration of caregiver's lifestyle, plans, finances, and housing
needs


• Intense involvement with medical systems, hospitalizations,
handling numerous appointments, problems in obtaining
medications, and making medical decisions that may be life
threatening


• Child care, especially as the caretaker's illness progresses


• Legal guardianship and permanency planning


• Behavior problems in children


• Issues related to death and dying


When the caregiver has AIDS, professionals need to be aware of
the previous issues and be able to help families deal with them by:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Providing ongoing assessment and counseling of psychosocial
needs of the parent or caregiver and children
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Helping parents plan for the future care of their children and
make preparations for themselves
</p>

<tr><td>
<p>
• Accessing resources for legal help with issues of temporary
placement during an acute exacerbation of the illness and later
with permanency planning

• Considering the needs of the whole family
</p>

<b>
<i>Caregiving Capacity</i>
</b>


The initial impact of learning of HIV infection is devastating
to most individuals. Depression, denial, anger toward the person
who is the probable source of HIV infection, and feelings of
shame, guilt, and fear of abandonment or violence are common.
The latter makes disclosure difficult; therefore, issues of confidentiality
are important when dealing with other family members.
Providing emotional support and referral to medical and
other professionals experienced in the care of HIV-infected individuals
is crucial. Assessment of the mother's or caregiver's ability
to care for children should be ongoing. Even when a mother is
ill, with support she can continue caring for her healthy children
but she may need special help if a child is also HIV infected and
is on multiple medications. If a parent is becoming sick, plans
should be discussed regarding future care of the children, such as
drawing up a formal legal permanency planning document. If the
parent needs hospitalization, help in arranging interim care for
children will be needed.

A strengths-based orientation to child protection practice
provides the opportunity to develop or build on existing
competencies needed by the family to respond to crises
and stress, to meet needs, and to enhance the functioning of the
family system. Uncovering strengths, however, cannot be accomplished
in a simplistic manner, just as using a checklist to asses
risk cannot capture the interrelationships among factors that
increase the likelihood of maltreatment. Strengths not isolated
variables but, rather, form clusters and constellations that
are dynamic and interrelated. Research on family strengths has
identified a core set of 12 qualities that help families cope with
stress and meet the needs of their members. This chapter reviews
each quality and considers how each of these areas of assessment
may be relevant to child protection practice. As you review these
areas, you will notice the interrelationships among them:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. A belief in and commitment to promote the well being and
growth of individual family members and that of the family
unit: Is this family in which all members reside in the same
household but each member comes and goes, or are there
strong connections between members? When important
decisions need to be made, do they talk over the implications

of the decision for each member? If there are strong alliances
between family members, individuals may be able to be
counted on to follow through with safety and treatment
plans that benefit other members.

[p. <i>338</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00358&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

2. Appreciation for the small and large things that individual
family members do well and encouragement to do better:
Similar to the first quality, if individuals are proud of each
other, then they will be more likely to support each other to
fully participate in a plan that will reduce the risk of
maltreatment. Ask each member to talk about the positive
qualities of other members. What makes them particularly
proud? How do they show or convey that positive feeling?
How often do they feel they take each other for granted? It
is important to remember that when caregivers feel unappreciated,
this may lead to negative interaction or withdrawal
from caregiving responsibilities.


3. Concentrated effort to spend times and do things together,
no matter how formal or informal the activity or event Ask
family members to talk about how they spend time together.
Even if they spend time pitching in together to do household
chores, there is a supportive quality to this activity versus
the case in which a family's members spend time in the same
household but not together. Ask what they like to do for fun
as a family. Even when things are difficult, if the family
works to do things together, individuals are less isolated and
more able to cope with stress.


4. A sense of purpose or agreement that permeates the reasons
and basis for continuing in both bad and good times. What
happens when the family faces a problem? Do family members
"stick together," or do they blame each other for their
troubles? If family members say they will be home at a
certain time to help with the evening meal, do they follow
through or do they let each down if they get better
offers? Even families who stick together in their negative
reaction to intervention possess a quality that we can build
on.


5. Common agreement among family members regarding the
value and importance of assigning time and energy to meet
needs: What do family members agree about? How do they
come to agreement on issues that are most important?

[p. <i>339</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00359&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

6. The ability to communicate with one another in a way that
emphasizes positive interactions: Are family members able
to share concerns and feelings with each other in productive
ways? When there are disagreements, do family members
listen to all sides of the story? This area of assessment is
especially important in families for which domestic violence
is a concern.


7. A clear set of family rules, values, and beliefs that establish
expectations about acceptable and desired behavior: Do
family members agree about how each member is expected
to behave? Does everyone have the same understanding
about family rules? In the absence of this quality, families
may have conflict because rules are unclear. Furthermore,
families who clearly do not hold consistent values and
beliefs may be more likely to neglect needs of some
members.


8. A varied repertoire of coping strategies that promote positive
functioning in dealing with stressful life events: Do
family members have ways to keep their mind off their
worries? Are they able to keep things in perspective and take
things one at a time? Do they have others to turn to for
support? Being overwhelmed with stress can result in withdrawn
behavior and possibly neglecting the needs of children
or in exploding, which could result in family conflict
or abuse.


9. The ability to engage in problem-solving activities, designed
to evaluate options for meeting needs and obtaining resources:
Are family members able to talk together about
problems and arrive at solutions, or do problems multiply
or seem to occur repeatedly without long term solutions
being developed? In families that seem to live in constant
crisis, and as a consequence the care of children is compromised,
this is a particularly important area of assessment.


10. The ability to be positive and see the positive in many aspects
of their lives, including the ability to view crisis and problems
as an opportunity to learn and grow: Do family members
have the view that something good can be found in

[p. <i>340</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00360&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

11. Flexibility and adaptability. Do family members have a
history of helping each other when something goes wrong?
Does everyone pitch in to find a solution to a problem?
When families have the capacity to adapt to unexpected
circumstances, relationships between members are less likely
to break down, and children are more likely to be nurtured
and supported.


12. A balance between the use of internal and external family
resources for coping and adapting to life events and planning
for the future: In times of need, does the family first
try to find solutions on their own? Are they able to recognize
when they need to access outside resources? These are skills
we try to build through our intervention.


Although it is unlikely that most families will show evidence
of strengths in all these areas, it is important that we examine
areas in which strength does exist. Examples of assessment instruments
(without copyright restrictions) to assess family
strengths, resources, and social supports are provided in Appendixes
8 and 9.

? <i>What Are Ethnographic Interviews?</i>


<i>Ethnographic interviews</i> are tools for learning about another
culture from an "insider's" point of view. The core concern is
with the meaning of actions and events to culture members.


? <i>What Is Culture?</i>


<i>Culture</i> can be defined as learned values, beliefs, and behaviors
of a defined group of people. The group may be as small as a
family or as large as a continent. Cultures differ in many ways
(e.g., child-rearing practices, ways of resolving conflicts, and
interpersonal communication).


Larger cultures, such as a nation's, have cocultures. Cocultures
share features of the larger culture but are also distinctive.
The United States has several cocultures--for example, African
American and Japanese American. In addition, many recent
immigrant groups are maintaining their native cultures (although
in the future they may evolve into cocultures). Thus, the United
States has a dominant culture, cocultures, and other cultures.

[p. <i>342</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00362&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Worker and client culture and coculture differences are a
major barrier to effective services. Culturally unaware workers
may be ineffective. They may misjudge a situation or provide
culturally inappropriate services or both. Ethnographic interviewing
may help you to overcome cultural barriers and become
more effective.


? <i>How Do Ethnographic Interviews
Compare With Other Interviews?</i>


Like all interviews, ethnographic interviews have a purpose; have
beginnings, middles, and ends; and use standard interviewing
techniques. Ethnographic interviews differ from other interviews
in specific purpose (interviewer learning), focus (culture), and
participants' roles (learner/teacher). They are more like friendly
conversations than formal interviews. The interviewer actively
expresses appreciation (e.g., "I'm learning so much from you"
and "I never heard about ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ diseases before").
Change-oriented interview techniques are not used.


? <i>What Do I Want to Know?</i>


Try to learn about child welfare-related topics that will be helpful
to you. Possible topics are family composition, structure, and
processes; child-rearing beliefs and practices; attitudes and behaviors
toward human service agencies; and helping resources
used by culture members. Because your time is limited, you will
need to prioritize your topics.


For your chosen topics, brainstorm possible questions. For
example, regarding families you might want to know who belongs
to the family, who is involved in child rearing and in what
way, what child behaviors are defined as acceptable and unacceptable,
how children are disciplined, and who speaks for the family
in its contacts with the outside world. What else might you want
to know?


? <i>What Should I Ask?</i>


What you want to know and what you ask in the interview are
not the same. People are generally unaware of significant aspects

[p. <i>343</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00363&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ethnographers usually focus on daily life by asking descriptive
questions. One approach is to ask a person to describe a typical
day. Using this approach, one can explore more fully an identified
topic when it is mentioned by the interviewee. Another approach
is to ask about a specific type of interaction or episode--for
example, "Tell me about the last time your son was disrespectful."
Try to obtain rich descriptive detail, for example, by asking the
parent to describe a recent incident and who was involved, when
and where it occurred, what happened, why he or she thinks her
son was disrespectful, and how he or she responded to the son.


"Disrespectful" is an example of a cover term. <i>Cover terms</i>
are words or phrases that literally cover a range of cultural ideas
and meanings. Sometimes, cover terms stand out because they are
unfamiliar to you. At other times, they will be familiar terms that
mean dfferent things to you and your client. For example, you
and a client may not mean the same thing by "good child" and
"bad child." Cover terms can literally "uncover" a wealth of
cultural information if explored. When you do an ethnographic
interview, you will need to balance following your interviewee's
lead and cover terms (he or she is the expert) with structuring the
interview to meet your learning needs.


? <i>Whom Can I Interview?</i>


You can use ethnographic interviewing techniques with clients,
other members of the culture, or people who are knowledgeable
about the culture.


? <i>How Do I Prepare for an Ethnographic Interview?</i>


Prepare by identifying what you want to know and writing
possible questions. Both are tools to help you listen for topics that
you might want to ask about in greater detail. Identified topics
can also help you to jump-start the interview if it lags. Decide
whether you want to ask the person to describe a typical day or
a type of episode. Choose the approach that you think will make

[p. <i>344</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00364&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To set the stage, admit your ignorance to your potential
interviewee, express interest in finding out what life is like for
him or her (or other culture members), ask the person to be your
teacher, arrange to meet in a mutually comfortable setting, and
agree on a time and time limit for the interview. Most important,
relax. Remember that ethnographic interviews are friendly, interesting
conversations. Enjoy your learning!

Family functioning is an elusive concept that has many
dimensions and is defined differently based on theoretical
principles and racial and cultural identity. Some practitioners
view attributes such as family adaptability (the ability to
change roles, rules, and relationships to cope with environmental
and personal stressors) and emotional bonding of family members
as critical dimensions of family functioning. Other practitioners
view family problem-solving abilities and communication
skills as critical dimensions. Irrespective of the theoretical perspective,
the purpose of assessing family functioning is to learn
how families manage typical daily living activities and to determine
whether these activities satisfy the needs of individual family
members and the family as a whole.


Assessments of family functioning evaluate environmental,
cultural, social, physical, and psychological functioning of its
members. The primary difference between family assessment and
individual assessment is a focus on the entire family as a unit as
opposed to focusing on a single individual within the family.
Given that family needs vary considerably depending on developmental
levels of family members, community assets, and access
to cultural, financial, material, and human resources, it is important
for practitioners to evaluate both family strengths and needs

[p. <i>346</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00366&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This chapter outlines four primary attributes of healthy family
functioning: Connections, Assets, Relationships, and Environment
(CARE). These attributes capture both internal family
interactions and transactions between families and larger systems.
It should be noted that practitioners may not formally assess each
of the CARE dimensions. Family problems, severity of crises, and
family composition will help set priorities.


? <i>Connections</i>


Connections are the first element in the CARE assessment of
family functioning. This assesses family access to resources and
supports outside the household, including extended family members,
neighbors and friends, schools, employers, health and mental
health services, religious institutions, recreational activities,
and other community groups and organizations. Social support
systems generally help in the following ways: supplying food and
clothing, lending or giving money, assistance with health or
mental health needs, and providing emotional support, help with
job hunting, child care, transportation, recreation, use of telephone
and appliances, and ethnic and cultural activities.


Connections are an important component of family functioning.
The reciprocal nature of social support makes it especially
appropriate for families with limited resources. Goods and services
may be exchanged, making families feel less like they are
receiving charity than asking for help. All families need resources
outside of the family unit to function optimally. During the
assessment, practitioners collect information on the types of
formal resources available in the community (public transportation,
public safety, recreational and educational resources, and
health and mental health services) and informal resources (relationships
with friends, extended family, and neighbors). This
element of family assessment is especially pertinent to families of
color. Racism, discrimination, and poverty require many families
of color to depend on each other to meet daily needs by sharing
meals, child care, and a home.

[p. <i>347</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00367&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Assets</i>


This element of the CARE protocol focuses on skills and abilities
that enable healthy family functioning, including parenting skills,
knowledge of child development and age-appropriate expectations,
and problem-solving abilities.


<i>
<b>Parenting and Child Development
Knowledge and Skills</b>
</i>


Caregivers are the most important and influential people in
young children's lives. An evaluation of healthy family functioning
must include data on the caregiver's parenting knowledge and
skills. In addition to assessing the degree of affection, emotional
bonding, physical care of a child, and discipline techniques, the
ability of caretakers to teach children skills and to set limits must
also be assessed. Parents must understand the developmental and
cognitive abilities of children at various ages because these dictate
what children are able to do. For example, parents of 3-year-olds
cannot expect them to make their beds perfectly. Three-year-olds
are unable to understand the steps involved in making a bed, and
they do not have the fine motor abilities to do so. Other important
parenting skills to assess include competence in establishing
rules and setting limits, structuring time and activities, ignoring
inappropriate behaviors, and rewarding and punishing behaviors.


Although assessment of parental roles is important, it is crucial
to also assess attitudes and perceptions of children. For example,
do children show respect for parents? Do they follow instructions?
Do children have shared activities and companionship with
parents? Are children involved in age-appropriate family decision
making and problem solving?


<i>
<b>Problem-Solving Skills</b>
</i>


Families are constantly faced with unexpected emergencies,
obstacles, and problems. Occasionally, these problems are significant,
and at other times they are minor. Irrespective of the type
of problem, a family's ability to systematically strategize, generate
solutions, and select a plan increases the likelihood of satisfactory

[p. <i>348</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00368&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

? <i>Relationships</i>


This CARE element assesses relationships with other household
members, communication patterns, and roles and their effect on
relationships between family members. The nature and quality of
relationships with family members can be a key factor in assessing
family functioning. Families that have a strong sense of identity
and connectedness, share common values, beliefs, rituals, and
cultural traditions, interact with each other in warm and affirming
ways, and express warmth and affection toward each other
are likely to be able to draw on these resources during crisis
periods. Family members who are isolated from each other,
maintain troublesome communication patterns, feel little pride
or sense of "oneness" as a family group, or have weak bonds and
little commitment to each other, however, are much less likely to
pull together during stressful times. Particular attention should
be given to assessing a family's cultural identity, pride, and
relationship to ethnic community resources and services. Having
a strong racial identity and practicing cultural rituals and traditions
can help sustain families through difficult times.


<i>
<b>Communication</b>
</i>


Open communication is the most important characteristic in
healthy family functioning. Practitioners must carefully attend to
both verbal and nonverbal communication because messages are
often incongruent. For example, tone of voice and facial expression
might send a different message than words. Although verbal
and nonverbal messages are essential, the most important component
of communication is listening. Assessing if family members
speak for themselves or depend on others to speak for them
gives clues to inappropriate communication patterns and to
power relationships within the family. Practitioners should observe
and inquire about typical communication patterns among
family members.


In addition to communication patterns, it is important to
assess relationships (subsystems) within the family, including

[p. <i>349</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00369&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>
<b>Roles</b>
</i>


All family members perform specific roles to maintain relationships
in families. These roles help to maintain the stability of
the family and are often gender based and stereotypical. For
example, women routinely perform roles such as caregiver, nurturer,
child care provider, disciplinarian, cook, house cleaner, and
relational roles such as wife, girlfriend, lover, partner, mother,
grandmother, sister, and friend. Children also stabilize the family
by playing roles such as scapegoat, passive child, perfect child,
rebel, troublemaker, comedian, and studious child. The ability to
perform several roles and to move in and out of these roles fluidly
is crucial.


It is critical to assess family roles because roles tend to be
complementary. For example, if one parent is strict, the other
tends to be lenient, and if one child is quiet and passive another
tends to be boisterous and assertive. Complementary roles reinforce
each other. When assessing the significance of roles in
families, it is important to understand that people tend to become
established in their roles and find it difficult to change because
other family members expect that behavior. Family members may
find themselves stuck in certain roles while at the same time
hoping others will change.


? <i>Environment</i>


This is the final element of the CARE protocol, and it assesses the
home environment and sufficiency of resources to meet the daily
living needs of family members. This element assesses economic
resources (source, stability, and adequacy of income) and tasks
for basic living. For example, workers should assess the safety and
adequacy of current living arrangements, including space, basic
household provisions (furnishings, toilet, bathing, cooking, and
sleeping), management of household chores, and regularity and
adequacy of meals.

? <i>Conducting an Assessment of Family Functioning</i>


Practitioners use multiple sources of data when collecting information
for family assessments, including informal observation,
interviews, paper-and-pencil measures, and standardized measures.
The following are resources and suggestions for collecting
data to assess family functioning:


CARE Interview Questions


<i>
<b>Connection</b>
</i>


• In what ways are you and your family connected to other
members of the community?


• Does your family participate in any religious, cultural, or ethnic
community groups or organizations?


• Does your family experience any special risks or benefits from
living in the community?


• What types of help do you give and receive from your family
and friends?


<i>
<b>Assets</b>
</i>


• How do you discipline your children? Does the discipline work
for the short term? Long term? How do you know it is
working? Which method of discipline do you believe works
best?


• How do you manage your children when you are frustrated
with their behavior?


• When you are faced with a difficult problem, how do you go
about solving it? Who is involved in the decision? What
happens if your plan fails? Are all problems solved this way, or
do you solve some problems differently?


<i>
<b>Relationships</b>
</i>


• How would you describe your relationship with other family
members? (Relationship)


• How well do family members communicate needs and expectations?
(Communication)



[p. <i>351</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00371&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• Tell me about your daily routine. Start at the beginning of the
day and tell me who does what? (Roles)


• Is your family's problem related to someone failing to perform
an expected role? Why is the role important? What would
happen if the person never performs the role? (Roles)


• Which members belong in the family (family members may be
biological, adoptive, or close friends as long as they are considered
family members)?


<i>
<b>Environment</b>
</i>


• Is income sufficient to support your family (pay rent and utility
bills and supply necessities such as food and clothing)?


• Do you worry about your financial situation?


• What are the daily and weekly household chores?


• Who participates? How are those assignments decided?


• Does the family eat meals together? How often?


<i>
<b>Paper-and-Pencil Tools</b>
</i>


<i>Ecomap:</i> A graphic representation of a family's connection to
social resources. The ecomap uses circles to depict social resources
and symbols (dotted lines, broken lines, etc.) to represent
the nature and strength of the relationship.


<i>Genogram:</i> A graphic representation of three or more generations
of family members. The genogram can also include information
about intergenerational relationships, occupations, religious
background, family roles, and racial and cultural background.

A clear and responsive parent-child relationship forms the
basis for healthy personality development as children
learn to communicate their needs and desires and to
respond to the demands of others. Parent-child relationships play
such an important role in children's development that they can
protect or buffer children against the threat of a hostile environment,
such as poverty or community violence. In optimal circumstances,
the parent-child relationship is characterized by a balance
in which parents and children take turns signaling and responding
to one another. Communication is clear because each adapts to
the rhythm style of the other and to the demands of the situation.
For example, a mother's response to a crying child varies depending
on whether she thinks the cries signal hunger, pain, or fatigue.


In maltreating families, parent-child interactions are often
distorted and marked by signals that lack clarity, misperceptions
of signals, inconsistent responses, or responses that are not
appropriate. Thus, maltreatment may occur when a parent misperceives
the child's cries and responds either by withholding
basic caregiving needs (neglect) or by hitting the child "to make
him stop crying" (abuse). Similarly, parents who are depressed or
overwhelmed by their own mental health needs may be unable

[p. <i>354</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00374&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Children also vary in their capacity to communicate with their
parents. For example, children who are ill, premature, or temperamentally
challenging may be less able to communicate clearly.
An analysis of parent-child interaction is important in the evaluation
of maltreatment, but it does not necessarily yield an explanation
regarding the reason for the distortion.


Parent-child interaction is often assessed through three methods:
(a) self-report from the parent or child, (b) report from
another source (nurse, teacher, social worker, etc.), or (c) direct
observation. Self-report often includes an interview with the
participants about the interaction. Questions may be directed to
the parent or child (usually individually and in private) and
address their perceptions of the quality of the interaction. Report
from another source is assessed by interviewing a third party
about the interactions observed between the parent and child.
Direct observation occurs when the parent and child are observed
interacting with one another.


Although evaluations of parent-child interaction are often
directed toward parents and their infants or toddlers, parent-child
interaction is a critical issue throughout children's development
and should not be limited to the early years. Evaluations
should be directed toward both parents and children rather than
focusing exclusively on parental behaviors, and they should
include information about the context. For example, if a child
has been ill or a family pet has died, interactions may not be
typical. In addition, evaluations should consider multiple contexts.
Children and parents may have little difficulty communicating
with one another in low-stress situations in which there
are few demands, such as free play, but they may have difficulty
in situations that are potentially stressful, such as mealtimes or
separations.


Observations of interactions may be conducted in the home,
during health care visits, or in other settings (e.g., during a meal,
playing a game, reading a book, and waiting for a visit). The
following questions are synthesized from existing protocols of
parent-child interactions and can be used to guide observations
or interviews:

<b>
<i>Position</i>
</b>


• Are the parent and the child positioned so they are comfortable?
In the case of a young child, does positioning provide
adequate support?


• Are parent and the child able to see and hear one another?


<b>
<i>Setting</i>
</b>


• Is the environment free from distractions (noise and activity)
that may disrupt the parent and the child?


• Are the parent and the child dressed appropriately for the
setting?


• Are the parent and the child clean and adequately groomed?


• Are the demands of the situation (i.e., what's expected) clear?


<b>
<i>Parent and Child: Clarity of Cues and Comments</i>
</b>


• Do the parent and the child direct clear and coherent comments to one another?


• Are comments or instructions from the parent to the child
consistent with the child's developmental level?


• Does the child use words or actions to attract the parent's
attention (rather than misbehaving)?


• Does the parent praise the child after he or she has done
something positive?


• Does the parent prepare the child for new events or activities?


<b>
<i>Parent and Child: Responsivity</i>
</b>


• Do the parent and the child look at and attend to one another
periodically (as opposed to ignoring one another or attending
to other activities)?


• Do the parent and the child "listen" to what the other says or
watch what the other does (or does each respond only if the
other person is loud, forceful, etc.)?


• If one person makes an error, does the other person correct the
error respectfully (as opposed to laughing or making a disparaging
comment)?


• If one person exhibits distress, does the other person offer
comfort or support?


• If one person makes a request, does the other person acknowledge
the request?

• If the child is disruptive or misbehaves, does the parent discipline
the child without disparaging the child's character, evoking
guilt, or physically forcing the child? Does the child end
the disruptive behavior?


<b>
<i>Parent and Child: Affect</i>
</b>


• Do the parent and the child have affectionate expressions (as
opposed to neutral or hostile expressions)?


• Do the child and the parent smile or laugh in response to
something positive?


• Are comments between the parent and the child affectionate
and respectful (as opposed to hostile or exclusively directives)?


• Does the child cope with new events or activities without
becoming distressed or withdrawn?


• If the parent praises the child, does the child look appreciative
or happy?


• Are conflicts resolved with mutual respect?


• Is the overall tone of the interaction positive and mutually
respectful?

? <i>General Considerations</i>


Because domestic violence and child maltreatment are closely
correlated, all cases of child maltreatment should be assessed for
possible domestic violence. If domestic violence is discovered in
a family, it is important to remember that all children are indirectly
affected by domestic violence in the family, whether they
are maltreated or not. Each child in the family should be assessed
for the possible effects of domestic violence. The effects on
children of exposure to domestic violence vary widely. Common
sense may lead one to believe that the severity of a child's
response to witnessing domestic violence is correlated with the
severity of the violence that he or she has witnessed, but this is
not so. The child's age, developmental stage, gender, and role in
the family interact with the nature of the violence he or she has
witnessed to heighten or to mitigate the effects of witnessing
violence. All assessments are of unique individual children in
specific family situations. Assessment of the child's treatment
needs involves knowing what to examine (assessment criteria),
where and how to examine (assessment process), and how to
interpret the information (treatment planning).

? <i>Assessment Criteria: Distress Versus Trauma</i>


Some experts suggest that all children who experience sudden,
unexpected, and overwhelming situations that include high
physiological arousal and affective constriction, such as witnessing
domestic violence, will experience distress. The following are
signs of distress:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Coping ability is temporarily overwhelmed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Defenses are used flexibly.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) responses are
evident.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Personal and environmental resources can be accessed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Outlets for expressive responses are used.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Dynamic play occurs in therapy.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Memories of distressing events are specific.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• A sense of control is regained in a timely way.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The distressing event is experienced as something that
happened.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The implicit or actual threat to a child's "being" is resolved.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• Coping ability is temporarily overwhelmed.


• Defenses are used flexibly.


• Acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) responses are
evident.


• Personal and environmental resources can be accessed.


• Outlets for expressive responses are used.


• Dynamic play occurs in therapy.


• Memories of distressing events are specific.


• A sense of control is regained in a timely way.


• The distressing event is experienced as something that
happened.


• The implicit or actual threat to a child's "being" is resolved.


When physiologic arousal and affective constriction are intense
and chronic, trauma results. The following are signs of
trauma:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The child's coping ability is chronically overwhelmed.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Defenses are rigid and become part of the child's personality
structure.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Chronic PTSD responses and fragmentation of personality are
evident.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The child is isolated from personal and environmental
resources.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• The child shows defensive symptomatology or acting-out
behaviors or both.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Play in therapy is static or repetitive, lacking thematic
movement.
</p>
</td></tr>

• The child has a debilitating and pervasive sense of loss of
control.


• Traumatic events are experienced as self-defining ("I am
bad" or "I am a troublemaker").


Traumatized children have incorporated the violence they
have witnessed into their sense of themselves. These children
display persistent (longer than 1 month) symptoms or acting-out
behaviors that cause them emotional disturbance or impairment
in important areas of functioning that may include:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Reexperiencing the traumatic events via intrusive
thoughts or feelings, recurring dreams, flashbacks, and
distress or reactivity to cues similar to the traumatic events
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Avoiding thoughts, people, and places that remind children
of the traumatic events as well as difficulty in
recalling aspects of the trauma
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• General numbing of responsiveness, reducing interest and
participation in significant activities, restricted affect, and
a sense of doom or limited future
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• Evidence of increasing arousal demonstrated in sleep
problems, irritability, outbursts out of keeping with
provocation, hypervigilance, concentration problems,
and heightened startle response

? <i>The Assessment Process</i>


Assessment is a process of sampling information from different
sources in different circumstances. Direct and indirect interviewing,
observation, testing, and using collaterals are assessment
methodologies. Direct interviewing involves speaking to individuals
directly about issues. The child and family are primary
sources of information. Extended family, substitute caregivers,
educators, and others involved with the family can provide
collateral responses to direct questioning. Indirect interviewing
refers to techniques that allow assessment criteria to surface in
response to inquiries that are not directly related to family
violence. Indirect inquiry is important because children and

[p. <i>360</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00380&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Observations of family members interacting in office or at-home
setting in dyads, with peers, and in the family group can
yield assessment criteria unavailable via interview. Arranging
visitation, structured or unstructured parent-child play, caregiving
opportunities, discussions, and home visits provide the assessor
an opportunity to gather information about assessment criteria
through observation.


A variety of tests, interview questionnaires, and other written
or interview protocols may yield additional assessment information.
Child and adult attachment inventories, developmental
assessment tools, personality assessment tools, and family interaction
and relationship assessment tools can all yield information.
Currently, however, there is no one assessment tool that specifically
assesses the treatment needs of children who witness family
violence.


? <i>Interpreting Treatment Needs Based on
Information Generated During Assessment</i>


The assessment process generates information that can be compared
to the framework provided by assessment criteria. Using
these criteria, the assessor can determine if the child appears to
be more or less distressed or traumatized. Distressed children can
benefit from relatively short-term treatment. Treatment of choice
involves guaranteeing their safety, activating existing personal
and environmental resources, and giving them the opportunity
in therapy to identify, express, and work through upsetting
experiences. This may occur in group or short-term individual
therapy. Traumatized children are likely to require long-term
intervention and, perhaps, special circumstances to help them
monitor and manage self-defeating or explosive behaviors. In
general, traumatized children need

• To move from unpredictable danger into reliable safety


• To integrate trauma by reconstructing and assimilating the
"trauma story" with acknowledged affect and memory


• To move from isolation to reconnection of tnoughts to
feelings and past experiences to the present and to connect
to a community of supportive relationships


? <i>Summary</i>


In summary, assessment of the treatment needs of children who
witness domestic violence requires familiarity with criteria related
to distress and traumatization, use of a variety of methodologies
to obtain relevant information, and the determination of
the best course of treatment based on clinical judgments regarding
the assessment information.

When practitioners begin working with families, the
anticipated outcome depends on the goals of the treatment
program or social work services; in all cases,
however, practitioners begin services with great anticipation of
positive outcomes. This chapter identifies family and worker
factors that hinder or facilitate successful outcomes. An accurate
assessment of these factors will assist workers and families in
developing realistic expectations and meaningful intervention
plans.


? <i>Worker Factors</i>


Engaging and motivating families are important qualities in
successful interventions. Family commitment to intervention
plans is largely based on the worker's ability to "join" the family.
Joining is the most critical initial task of family intervention and
is the foundation of future success with families. It refers to a
family's sense of connection to the social worker. A practitioner's
ability to enhance connections with families by demonstrating
understanding, instilling hope, showing respect, and expressing

[p. <i>363</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000334627-I00383&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another worker quality that facilitates successful outcomes is
the ability to balance family problems, needs, and stressors with
strengths, resources, and assets. Families may feel hopeless if all
interactions with workers focus on problems and deficits. A
worker who has skills in acknowledging, validating, and affirming
family strengths, resources, and needs facilitates the likelihood
of achieving positive outcomes with families.


? <i>Family Factors</i>


A family's likelihood for succeeding depends on the family's
insight into their problem, prior involvement with child welfare
services, overall family stress, and available resources and assets.
Although a family's ability to recognize and articulate their own
strengths helps reinforce interventions and increase the likelihood
of successful outcomes, family strengths will not be discussed
in this chapter.


A family's insight into their own environmental stressors (e.g.,
eviction, loss of job, and serious illness) and personal stressors
(e.g., marital conflict, gross neglect, substance abuse, and domestic
violence) helps in assessing the likelihood of a successful
intervention. A family that can understand and identify environmental
and personal stressors contributing to a family crisis is
much more likely to be able to problem-solve and to change
behaviors to increase family stability.


Prior involvement with child welfare services is another important
factor in assessing the likelihood of success. Families
previously involved with child welfare may be discouraged,
believing that family conditions will never change; they are not
likely to engage in services or to be motivated to change. Families
who have experienced positive involvement with child welfare
assistance, however, may be more likely to be motivated, hopeful,
and ready to become actively involved in services again.


A third factor for assessing the likelihood for successful
intervention is an assessment of the overall family stress. Families

Finally, a family's resources and assets may contribute to
treatment outcomes. Availability and access to transportation,
adequate and safe housing and neighborhoods, employment-related
stress, marital conflict, inadequate health care, and racial,
gender, or sexual discrimination may affect a family's outcome.
