BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So I thank you very much for helping me -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Communicate better.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  How have you been doing?
<b>PT:</b> Fine.  Um, I don't know whether you know that I had a heart attack back on, uh, well, I went to the doctor on [DATE] because I was having chest pains after -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Um, my visit with you.  It wasn't the same day that I saw you, but when I said I wanted to go get my chest x-rays to see what they said.
<b>DR:</b> That's right.
<b>PT:</b> So, but in the meantime before I could get there, I called my doctor and told him that I wanted to come in to have an EKG done and I want my chest, I was having pains in my chest and I wanted him, you know, to do an EKG on me so when I get there -
<b>DR:</b> You were smart.  Oh, my goodness.
<b>PT:</b> When I got there, he said that I needed to go to the hospital.  So I went, he sent me to [DEIDENTIFIED].  When I got to [DEIDENTIFIED], they did another EKG.  They told me I had a heart attack 2 weeks before that.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't even know it was a heart attack.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.  Did you remember feeling anything like indigestion or a shooting pain in your arm?
<b>PT:</b> It did.  Yes, shooting pain in my arm and some -
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes that's a sign.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and then the, uh, clamminess.  That was when my legs was tired.  I meant to bring the little thing that they put this thing in me -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Um, the little card and stuff, but I thought I would travel light, but I left the name of the medication that I was taking.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, the card that they had gave me to, cause I had coronary heart valve disease -
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my word.
<b>PT:</b> And a rheumatic fever valve.
<b>DR:</b> Was this when you were a child?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they said I must have had it when I was a child and I didn't, I don't remember having it.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't know.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That's a shock.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so they got me on heart medicine, but my case manager, I call her [NAME OTHER].  I called her right after getting home from the hospital and I gave her the list of medicines that I was taking.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  I know that somebody left me a message.  So metoprolol -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Simvastatin, the baby aspirin 1 a day -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The Plavix -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And lisinopril.  Wow.  My goodness.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I'm lucky.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness you're right.  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't even know.  I was still doing my household chores and everything.  I didn't even know that I had one when I -
<b>DR:</b> Bless your heart.
<b>PT:</b> When they told me at the hospital, I said, a heart attack?
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  And that's why they call it a silence, you know, kind of a situation.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Another remarkable thing is that your blood work has been excellent, um, you know, with your cholesterol, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Everything except a one measure.  Remember we, uh, looked at something that might tell us about arthritis.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I went there -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> On, um, they said it's just a little, uh, they don't call it, uh, it's a form of arthritis, um, but it's a ost, it's something, but it's just, the, um, bone in here, wear and tear or something she said, but I don't have to come back for a, a year, but they didn't even put me on no medication either.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you have pain anywhere else?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, just right here.
<b>DR:</b> Just the arthritis?  It's that one spot [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> And sometimes over here and sometimes in my knees, but mostly right here -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> In the joint part.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Wow.  And they didn't give you any particular medication to help with that [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> No, I just take Aleve and that leaves, you know, take away the pain.
<b>DR:</b> So the Aleve does work okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  Well, bless your heart.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now that they know about the rheumatic heart valve, do they feel as though the medicine that you're taking should help prevent any future problems?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, um, they said I shouldn't have no problem, but the Plavix and the aspirin, I can't miss it.  That I got to take it -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Everyday.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Well, you're very wise and I know you're really excellent about, uh, making sure that you take your medication on a regular basis.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, and the only thing they advised me to do is to stop smoking the cigarettes -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And they didn't say, too much say nothing about my diet, but I know I have to watch my diet.
<b>DR:</b> And you've been good about that.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum, but I wonder why they have me on, well, I'll ask the heart doctor next time I go -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> To the appointment because if I didn't have high blood pressure, I didn't have no cholesterol when I came in, why am I on the medication?  I know they said one cholesterol medicine was to prevent, um, your arteries from clogging up -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't, I don't mind taking the heart medicine and the, um, aspirin, but after a few months, I'm going to ask, um, why do I have to be cause it's a low dose of, um, blood pressure medicine and, and, uh, I think it's a low dose of blood pressure medicine and -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> The, um,  medicine that I take, if my blood work and everything is fine, I don't see why I have to take something for cholesterol and high blood pressure if I didn't have either one of those and I'm not diabetic or noth, anything.
<b>DR:</b> I think sometimes even within the normal range, sometimes a person can be in the high end of that and maybe, you know, how cholesterol can build up in your blood vessels.  Uh, maybe it can happen on a damaged heart valve too.  I'm not quite sure.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So they may be using it in your situation a little bit like the aspirin to help prevent -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Something in the future.  Um, and how much are you smoking these days?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I had, when I came home from the hospital, I was down to 2 cigarettes a day.  I don't know whether it's cause of the holiday or what, but I wasn't really buying a pack.  Just the last couple of weeks, I bought a pack and I smoked 9 cigarettes that day -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And then I had the rest of them to the next day and then a day after that, um, I bought a pack.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And how long has that lasted you?
<b>PT:</b> The pack?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It only lasts like 2 or 3 days -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But I don't need to be smoking at all.  That's the one thing that they want me to stop.  They say it could cut my chances, you know, if I stop smoking the cigarettes -
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> After, it's, I'll be okay and, but as long as I smoke the cigarettes, I might, I could be back in the hospital.
<b>DR:</b> It's an extremely hard habit to break.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it is.
<b>DR:</b> I used to smoke as well and I smoked about as much as you did.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know, sometimes 2 cigarettes -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes a little bit more, but I felt like I really needed it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they say go cold turkey -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> But they don't understand.  A person that don't smoke, it's hard.
<b>DR:</b> It can be really hard.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I'm looking back.  I'm going way, way back in history before we even started working together.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> I'm looking at some of the different medicines that you've tried.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> One of them, and this is going way back -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> To 1998 with Wellbutrin.  Do you remember anything about how you felt when you took the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> What happened?
<b>PT:</b> It had me having more anxiety -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It can because it was originally, uh, developed to be like a diet pill.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You know how some diet pills were like an amphetamine -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And speeds people up.  So I definitely would not want to worsen that.
<b>PT:</b> No, 'cause I didn't like that.  I remember that medicine.
<b>DR:</b> You have a good memory.  Yeah, 'cause it's also -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Zyban.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, doxepin, this was way back with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Effexor.  Imipramine.  I know you and I worked with that some back in 1997, um, and I think partly because of the chronic pain that you were feeling -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> As well as the panic, uh, that was -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Adding onto your depression.  Serzone we had for a little while.  Um, I'm just trying to see if there's anything else from the past that might be something we could consider again to help with the nonsmoking.
<b>PT:</b> I hope it will, that will be a blessing for me.
<b>DR:</b> Did your heart doctor talk to you at all about Chantix?  That's that new -
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Antismoking pill.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> That might be something.  I -
<b>PT:</b> They were just telling me to go cold, they was plum, they, just go cold turkey.
<b>DR:</b> That's easy for other people to say.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, my goodness.  Um, you've done well with the Remeron and the lorazepam for -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Quite some time.  Um, why don't I give you some information.  The Chantix is the new antismoking pill.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, it involves taking it for 2 or 3 months.  A lot of plans do cover it.  Uh, I was thinking maybe we can set an appointment for early in the new year, give you a chance to read up about it, see what you think about maybe giving it a try.  I'm reluctant to load on too much with the holidays coming and the new medicine that you've taken.  However, um, I can give you the information and if you say, hey, this is great, I can't wait to start, uh -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I can't just try it?
<b>DR:</b> It's a situation where usually they recommend you give it at least a month and you start taking like 1 pill a day for a couple of weeks and then you move up to 2 pills a day or whatever.  Um, let me get out some information on it 'cause I think it could be okay to take it with what you're taking now.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I also could call the pharmacy and see could I take it.
<b>DR:</b> That's definitely true.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause, because they have, you know, the, all the heart medicine that I take and when I have to take a cold medicine, I ask them what could -
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.  I know I have some information about this.  Let me just see.  Something that's readable.  Okay.  Here it is.
<b>PT:</b> Does it have any side effects like anxiety or anything?
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes and that's the tough thing.  Sometimes people report feeling a little bit more depressed.  So if you did, then I would recommend holding off, you know, save your pills and wait until the next time that we get together so we can talk -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> About it.  Um, this does a nice job explaining some of what's going on with it and I can make a copy of this for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And this is also a lot of detail about the Chantix here.  Um, so basically, um, part of the way it's set up, this is one also that I, uh, printed out from online -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Is that, um, you start with just, uh, a pill a day, then you work your way up a little bit, and it makes you want to smoke less essentially.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So sometimes, here's a good illustration.  I can copy this for you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Day 1 to 3, you take 1 tablet a day and it comes like in a packet where all this is written out.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Day 4 to 7, 2 a day, and then day 8 to the end of treatment, 1 a day.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> So I wouldn't be on it for that long.
<b>DR:</b> It's usually, they recommend ideally 12 weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, there's a lot of information in here about potential side effects, usually upset stomach, sometimes some constipation.  Uh, sometimes people have strange dreams.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, and sometimes they feel more depressed.  If you felt more depressed, I would say hold off -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And, um, you know, until the next time that we have a chance to get together.  So the other thing that they mention and it's a good point, some people are able to stop smoking right away and it takes a little bit of time to adjust to not having the nicotine -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> In your system.  So you may feel a little bit sleepier, uh, but usually that goes away after a few days and you have had times where you only smoked 2 cigarettes a day.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> I would want to give that a try.
<b>DR:</b> I think it's definitely worth considering.  Let me write you a prescription for it -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm going to Xerox these for you so you'll have it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> That'll also give you some information.  It also comes with a very nice, um, kit.  There's -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> An 800 number that you can call.  Um, the company that makes it is very committed to helping people stay with it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So and there are some things that, uh, you know, essentially are reasons that people stop.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> My doctor told me smoking hurts my health.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, it's hard to catch my breath.  I don't want to expose my family and friends to smoke.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Don't want to spend the money on it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's true.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It's expensive these days.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I have been saving a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Yes, that's so good and with the holidays coming and everything.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Well, let me go ahead and write out a prescription for you.  Good for you.  I think that's -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I, I -
<b>DR:</b> Really important.
<b>PT:</b> Really, really do want to stop smoking cigarettes.
<b>DR:</b> That is the spirit.  All right.  Let me get out my prescriptions for you.  Well, bless your heart.  That's a real shock.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You're so healthy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I thought I was too.
<b>DR:</b> And we just got back those wonderful -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Lab reports -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But then again sometimes especially with rheumatic fever, it kind of leaves your heart valve, uh, vulnerable -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I didn't even know -
<b>DR:</b> To infections.
<b>PT:</b> When I was a kid that I, my mom never said anything about it.
<b>DR:</b> She may not have even realized it
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Since, you know, back when we were growing up, you know, there were a lot of things going around.  Mumps and, you know, people had fevers and -
<b>PT:</b> But then they said it's not common in the U.S.A.  So my dad, he was overseas a lot.  So I was thinking maybe -
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  That's possible.
<b>PT:</b> He came and gave us a kiss or something and that's maybe how I caught it or something.
<b>DR:</b> Without even realizing.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It is possible.
<b>PT:</b> You think my insurance will pay for that?
<b>DR:</b> It often does.  Now if you run into any trouble, um, what I will do is do what's called a prior authorization -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And that is when I call or write something to fax to the company saying it's really important for your health -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we have the documentation that you were seen for -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> A heart problem and that it's very -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Important that you stop and I think that they will approve it.  We may need to fight with them a little bit, but I'm going to write it on a separate -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Prescription.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'm even going to put down the nurse's number -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You know, if the pharmacist needs to get the message to us right away.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I believe that the first month they just do the starter pack -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And then I'm going to write for the second and third months.  It's that 10 mg blue tablet twice a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So this will be month number 1.  Okay.  And then months number 2 and 3 and once we get the approval, they're probably going to approve the whole 90 days.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> With all this going on, it sounds like you're staying on top of your depression pretty well.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I am.
<b>DR:</b> That's wonderful.
<b>PT:</b> I just recently started, um, like last week having a little panic attack here and a little panic attack there.  I think it's close to the holidays.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.  Do you have enough lorazepam to help you get through -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> That period?  Okay.  'Cause I could write for an extra one if that might help, you know, from time to time you  might need an extra one in the course of the day.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Why don't I do that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just so you'll have it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know, if you end up a little bit ahead of the game, that's all right.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  So the way I'm going to write it now, I had been writing the 1 mg 4 times a day as needed.  I'll put, um, 1 every 4 hours as needed and then you could have up to 5 a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So if you wake up in the middle of the night -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Heart pounding and just that terrible -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Especially if this can aggravate your [INAUDIBLE] a little -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It'll be nice to have something that you can take.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Do you still take the Periactin?
<b>PT:</b> I don't need no more right now.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't need [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's just a once-in-a while thing I know.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So we'll put the Remeron on the last prescription.  Okay.  So we've got the Remeron, the lorazepam.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Now you can take up to 5 a day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Chantix, months 2 and 3.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Which if you want, you can go ahead and turn it in with month number 1.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You know, they'll, they'll understand I went ahead and wrote for the whole 90 days.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So I'm going to put please call nurse, [NAME OTHER], at [DEIDENTIFIED] with prior auth questions.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then we can work on it together, but definitely that would be something helpful.
<b>PT:</b> All right.  Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> No problem.  So I'm going to walk out with you while you make a follow-up appointment.  I'm going to Xerox these things -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So you can have them on hand and let's have you come back maybe in the next month or 2 just see how it's going, how things are sitting with this, um, sort of in the middle of when you're taking it.
<b>PT:</b> Do I have to come back for these too when I come back for this?
<b>DR:</b> Two months, yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.
<b>DR:</b> Is that okay?
<b>PT:</b> I thought we was doing 3 months on that.
<b>DR:</b> Do you think you might be able to do the 3 months with it?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> All right.
<b>PT:</b> That's what, I thought that's what we was doing.
<b>DR:</b> I'll tell you what, why don't we plan on that and then if you need to come back sooner -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Just call and let them know.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] 2 refills.
<b>PT:</b> I don't have to take any blood work while I'm on this medicine?
<b>DR:</b> There's no special blood work that they recommend.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Anything that your doctor recommends that you have, you know, on the basis of, um, of, uh, what's going on with your heart situation -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It would be great to have copies faxed here.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um -
<b>PT:</b> You want, you have a fax number 'cause -
<b>DR:</b> You bet.  I will put that down.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause I can tell my doctor to fax you the paperwork I mean from where I was in the hospital because he has that too.
<b>DR:</b> That would be so excellent.  All right.  And, in fact, on this prescription, that could be a note for your doctor -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I'm going to say planning to start Chantix, Chantix, 90-day plan, and then please fax any blood work or hospital records from past year and in future to me at [DEIDENTIFIED] and also put down my direct voicemail on here.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> My direct voicemail [DEIDENTIFIED] and I'll put the nurse.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  That's not a prescription, right?
<b>DR:</b> [NAME OTHER].  No, I'm just using it like a notepad.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And I'll, on top I'll put for [PATIENT NAME]'s medical team.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So for any doctor that you see -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> It's fine for them to have this contact info.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].  All righty.  So 2 refills and that gets you 3 months altogether with the Chantix -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> As well.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And definitely if you want to come back sooner, not a problem.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Now that's for your doctor.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You can take that to [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to copy this and just say I'm so glad you're okay.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.  And I appreciate it.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, bless your heart.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> There's a tissue if you'd like.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, take one for the road.
<b>PT:</b> Whoop.
<b>DR:</b> There you go.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you so much.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  Oh, it's my pleasure.  And I'll walk out with you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
