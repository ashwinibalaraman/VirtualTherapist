CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSESSMENT


In the 1950s, cardiologists Meyer Friedman and
Ray Rosenman observed that their cardiac patients
were more likely to display a specific combination of
behaviors called the Type A behavior pattern (TABP)
in comparison to individuals without heart disease.

Two general methods have been used to assess the
presence or absence of TABP: structured interviews
and self-report questionnaires. The Structured
Interview (SI) method developed by Rosenman and
Friedman, and a subsequent videotaped Structured
Interview (VSI), are considered the best means of
TABP assessment. During the SI, individuals are
asked a series of questions such as how they react to
waiting in lines, driving in slow traffic, and facing
deadlines at work and home. The interviewer evaluates
the degree to which feelings of impatience, hostility,
and/or competitiveness are expressed, as well as
the style of response. Stylistic indications of TABP
would include explosive, loud, and rapid speech, and
indications of a potential for hostility. The VSI is
videotaped so that Type A indicators such as head
nodding, rapid eye blinking, hostile facial expressions,
and vigorous gestures can be seen. Disadvantages of
using the SI and the VSI are the intensive interviewer
training that is required, variability due to the interviewer's
behavior while interviewing subjects, and the
variability in scoring taped interviews.


Several self-report questionnaires have been used
in studying TABP, such as the Bortner Rating Scale
Type, the Framingham Type A Scale, and the Jenkins
Activity Survey (JAS). The disadvantage of such measures,
however, is that they rely on self-perceptions,
which may not be accurate. Furthermore, individuals
may be influenced by the desire to endorse socially
admired characteristics. Nevertheless, self-report
methods have the distinct advantages of being less
expensive and easier to administer than structured
interviews, and have proven to predict coronary disease
in some studies (see below). Structured interviews
are generally preferred over questionnaires
because they directly evaluate behavior and have the
strongest association with coronary heart disease
(CHD).


EARLY RESEARCH ON
TABP ASSOCIATIONS WITH HEART DISEASE


Large-scale epidemiological studies on TABP as a
risk factor for heart disease began in the early 1960s.
The Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS) followed
3,524 men, ages 39 to 59 years, with annual
follow-ups for approximately 8 to 9 years (Rosenman
et al., 1975). Information such as medical history,
socioeconomic factors, physical activity, diet, and cigarette
smoking was collected, but the particular focus
of the study was the measurement of coronary-prone
behavior. TABP was assessed using the SI, with the
final behavioral rating being made without knowledge
of standard risk factors. Three key findings of the
WCGS supported the TABP-heart disease association:
(1) TABP was an independent risk factor for heart disease,
(2) men characterized as Type A had roughly
twice the risk of developing heart disease as their Type
B counterparts, and (3) the pattern was a good predictor
of a second heart attack in men who had already
suffered one.


Similar results were found in another large,
prospective study, the Framingham Heart Study,
which has followed more than 5,209 healthy residents
of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, since
1948 (Haynes, Feinleib, &amp; Kannel, 1980).
Participants were between 30 and 60 years of age at
the time of enrollment, and included both men and
women. Type A behavior in Framingham participants
was significantly correlated with the risk of CHD in
both men and women. These and subsequent studies
offered enough evidence for the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute to publish a critical review in 1981
in which a consensus of psychologists and cardiologists
concluded that TABP was an independent risk
factor for coronary heart disease in middle-aged U.S.
citizens in industrialized geographic areas (Review
Panel on Coronary-Prone Behavior and Coronary
Heart Disease, 1981).


CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS


Despite these promising early results, the majority
of studies conducted since 1979 have not reported a
positive relationship between TABP and coronary
heart disease. For example, an 8.5-year follow-up of
the WCGS revealed that among patients who survived
the 24-hour period following a coronary event, Type A

[p. <i>520</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284044-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It has been suggested that the discrepancy among
study outcomes may be due to the methods used to
assess Type A in these studies. Friedman and
Ghandour (1993) have argued that the detection of
TABP, similar to other diseases, cannot be made by
either a written or orally administered questionnaire.
Nevertheless, TABP investigations have generally
employed some type of questionnaire to assess Type A
behavior. Other proposed methodological problems
are sample bias due to the obvious exclusion of
patients with fatal myocardial infarctions, restriction
of range when using high-risk groups, and inconsistency
in scoring methods to evaluate disease.


Attempting to reconcile contradictory results, some
researchers have broken the Type A behavior construct
into subcomponents. What most studies have
found is that the hostility and anger dimensions of
TABP appear to be the most predictive of CHD.


DISEASE MECHANISMS


Assuming an association between TABP and coronary
disease, individuals with TABP may be more
vulnerable to heart disease than Type B persons
because they have a substantially greater sympathetic
nervous system response to stressful or demanding
circumstances. This response is characterized by
increases in heart rate and blood pressure, and a surge
in adrenal hormones. Because Type A people tend to
overrespond to challenges, no matter how large or
small, and because they place themselves in a greater
number of demanding circumstances, they experience
these heightened physiological responses for longer
periods of time each day. It has been suggested that
the frequent surges of epinephrine and other adrenal
hormones, which increase stress in the cardiovascular
system, may injure the inner layer (endothelium) of
the coronary artery walls, making them more susceptible
to atherosclerosis. Studies have also found that
Type A individuals tend to maintain high levels of stress
hormones throughout the daytime hours--levels that
do not decrease until after they have gone to sleep. The
deleterious effects of stress hormones on the heart and
the arteries are therefore greater in Type A persons.


TABP MODIFICATION


Modifying Type A behavior can be difficult, particularly
in a success-oriented culture that rewards competition
and ambition. Behavior modification,
relaxation techniques, and biofeedback training have
also been successfully used in altering TABP. A multifactor
approach, however, may be most beneficial, as
demonstrated by the Recurrent Coronary Prevention
Project (RCPP; Friedman, Thoresen, &amp; Gill, 1986).


In this study, approximately 900 TABP patients
who had suffered a myocardial infarction (i.e., heart
attack) were randomly assigned to either a control
group or a treatment group. The control group
received standard counseling, in the form of group
discussions about the importance of diet, exercise, and
medication adherence to avoid future cardiac events.
In addition to this standard counseling, patients in the
treatment group also received counseling designed to
modify the beliefs and expectations underlying Type
A behavior. More specifically, beliefs about material
achievement, being in control, and striving for the
approval of others were challenged. Behavioral
changes such as talking more slowly and interrupting
less were also promoted. After 4 years, there was a
45% lower occurrence of a second myocardial infarction
or sudden cardiac death in the group given TABP
modification. The RCPP was initially designed to
continue for at least 6 years; however, the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute insisted that because
the researchers had been able to demonstrate that
TABP modification significantly prevented coronary
recurrences, the TABP modification should be given
to the control groups. After 1 year, the percentage of
recurrence dropped dramatically in the original
control group.

The occupational stress and organizational psychology
literature also suggests that in order to reduce Type A
behavior and/or hostility, factors such as job demands,
time urgency, hostility, job insecurity, and a punitive climate
in the work environment need to be modified.


CONTRIBUTIONS OF TABP RESEARCH


Although the anger and hostility subcomponents of
Type A behavior are now largely considered the "toxic"
elements of the construct, the original TABP studies contributed
to a new and growing field called behavioral
medicine, dealing with the influence of psychological
and behavioral factors on health. TABP research resulted
in the recognition of the fact that behavioral characteristics
can be as influential on the disease process as such
traditional factors as high cholesterol and high blood
pressure. This subsequently led to decades of fruitful
behavioral research, as well as attention to the role of
stress and hostility in coronary heart disease.
