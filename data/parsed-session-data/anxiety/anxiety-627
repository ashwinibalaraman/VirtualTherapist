<font size="4"><b>He Only Hit Me Once and I Didn't Even Cry</b></font>

...Dad cried though. He cried a lot. At least that's what my mom
frantically reported back to me, her baby boy, about an hour after
the incident.


Physically speaking, I was fine. He really didn't even hit me that
hard, and I <i>did</i> deserve some sort of punishment, given what an asshole
I was being that night.

The reason I didn't cry was because I was so petrified that he had
used his belt for the first time, and as soon as he started to pull it out
of his beautiful, silk slacks, the only way I could escape the fright
was to imagine that it wasn't happening. I was sort of numb to any
real impact it might have had on me. It never should have happened
but his sons were acting like idiots and embarrassing the shit out of
him in front of his cronies.


Downstairs, about ten close friends of my parents, who routinely
came over for kosher food, gossip, and gin rummy, were unaware of
the drama unfolding a few floors above, and kept company with my
poor, stressed-out mother. She valiantly tried to keep them happy, at
the same time sensing the nightmare of a potential early death
upstairs. Given my dad's weak ticker, I suspect Mom was much more
concerned with losing a husband than an offspring. Given how I
already felt about myself in general, I could hardly blame her.


The brief and rare violence sort of went in slow motion. Dad
appeared more like Lee J. Cobb in <i>On the Waterfront</i> to me than anything
real, and taken by the intensity of it all, I felt more like a theater
patron than a bad boy.


Sure, there was a little bit of shock that set in for a few moments,
but I didn't feel as frightened as I might have because my brother,
the other rabble-rouser, also experienced Dad's frustration and
wrath, and having his company sort of diluted the overall panic.
There was a safety-in-numbers thing going down between us even
though it was just the two of us.


We were somewhere around the ages of David and Ricky Nelson.
For some reason that night we seemed to be acting crazily irresponsible
and not caring if we humiliated our folks. We simply refused to
give a civil "yes" to the scores of pleas from our parents to go to bed.
After six or seven snotty "no's" we were ushered away in a furious
energy field of my old man's pure will.


I don't remember whether it was my older brother or me who
was more to blame for that dark night, but, regardless, the eerie part
is that it was one of the few times I can recall, to that point in my
life, when I knew with any clarity that I had taken an action (albeit

Maybe that's why the belt seemed almost amusing to me. I actually
<i>was</i> a jerk-off that night and yet it was almost a relief to have
some kind of cause and effect, in a home where perhaps only parapsychologists,
or maybe archeologists, would have had an outside
chance of unraveling any understanding as to why things were said,
or why people responded the way they did. An unspoken veil of
confusion always lurked in my childhood home, and might have
prompted me to joke at the time, the world's youngest comic, "Hey,
I'll tell you, talk about anxiety, every room in my house is a wreck
room." The central feeling of my adolescence was never quite being
sure if my feelings or reasoning counted. This left marks deeper, and
more emotionally scarring, than anything a belt could ever do. I felt
like a little prizefighter, always on the ropes, trying to defend myself
for merely acting decently if whatever I've done or said didn't perfectly
reflect my parents' sense of things or put them in a good light.
For some odd and ultimately hurtful reason in their psychological
makeup, it was hard for them to allow me to be myself without it
almost always becoming adversarial if who myself was didn't agree
with them on every point. If I ate this I should've eaten that. If I
went to work with my father, it was either "about time" or "I'm not
really cut out for the job." If I felt sick and wanted to stay home from
school I was immediately doubted. It was like being in a matrix of
control and early on I fought my way out with jokes and isolation. I
remember my mother bought me these atrocious-looking green
pants and I just couldn't even think about wearing them but she
raised such a stink I wore them anyway, feeling like shit all day until
a very cool and hip teacher friend of mine made me see the ludicrousness
of it all and it was yet another occasion when laughter

Trust me, babe, <i>it's lonely at the bottom</i>. How was I supposed to act
when I had no idea how or why? My only choice, it became increasingly
clear, was to look for that same hole Alice found in Wonderland
so I could split from my own Confusionland, get the hell out of
that environment and find some impartial people—delicious
strangers, even if they had to look like fucking <i>talking playing cards</i>.
Emotional beggars can't afford to be choosers.


Although I was needy for the right attention, I still managed to be
simultaneously paranoid about my trick knees. Because if and when
I ever found that white rabbit and jumped down that hole after him
toward my hopeful salvation, it seemed like quite a long way and
who has time to get knee-pads at a potential turning point in your
life like this? Surprise! Surprise! I never found the hole except the
one I was already in.


Still, I'm sorry, Dad. I really am sorry. I'm sorry that I made you
cry that night, and the few other times, but I swear on your grave
that I had no idea who I was or what you or anyone else expected of
me. I also didn't know that the deck was stacked and the house
always won. Your house. <i>The House that Guilt Built</i>.


Just like in Las Vegas. The house always wins there, too. You
know I headlined a few times in Vegas? I made a lot of bread, too.
Ain't that something, man? You were gone a long time by then, but
you would probably have been proud of me, even though it was a

Funny, I never stopped performing, even when I wasn't getting
paid for it. And I swear, Pop, it kills me that you were never alive to
see me on stage. I bet you wouldn't have ever cried or dropped dead
because of that. I bet you would have applauded. I wish you could
have lived to be there.


I guess I never told you this until now but I never really felt like a
man in front of you. Come to think of it, I don't think I ever felt like
much of a man until I got on stage. Imagine that, Dad? I bet if I'd
only had the balls to tell you that when you were alive, you would
have been cool about it and would have made it all better. And I bet
you would have liked me more, too. I'm right, aren't I? Come on, I
know you're listening. Really. You see, I'm spiritual now. I swear.
Isn't that a good thing?...Fine, play hard to get. But it better be a
good thing because, man, it's been a <i>long road to serenity</i> and just a
hop, skip, and a jump to the bar down the street and insanity. You
know what? I have a feeling you know about this shit already without
me telling you.


But I don't think you know that I was always left feeling like the
little kid you hit with that cool, big belt of yours, on that night I
acted like a schmuck in front of your friends.


Anyway, I was too confused to apologize to you back then, but I
prayed, after Mom told me you were crying, that you knew I sort of
didn't know what the fuck I was doing. I never knew really, like I
said; not until I went on stage. Not until I became a comedian. People
always tell me what guts it must take to be a stand-up. Now <i>that's</i>
a joke. Between you and me, it's the easiest fucking thing I've ever
done or ever will do. It's like I had no choice; it just came naturally. I
rarely admitted it to myself back when I started—or rarely even
admit it now—but on stage, I really feel like "the luckiest man on the
face of the earth." Every night when there's an audience to see me I
am as grateful as Lou Gehrig was when he tragically was forced to
express his feelings to the world as he retired.


I hate to admit it to you but I always felt more comfortable

<i>I was on a mission</i>. Every day. For the rest of my life. It sounds stupid,
Dad, but in a weird way for me I guess it really was true what
they say, "the show must go on." I wish you could have been there.
Just fucking once. It only took me about eight weeks to get up the
nerve to go to a club but almost thirty years, and then not even to
your face, to really tell you how I really felt around you.
