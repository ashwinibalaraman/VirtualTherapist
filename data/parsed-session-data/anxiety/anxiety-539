IN PARIS ON A CHILLY EVENING LATE IN OCTOBER OF
1985 I first became fully aware that the struggle with
the disorder in my mind--a struggle which had engaged
me for several months--might have a fatal outcome.
The moment of revelation came as the car in
which I was riding moved down a rain-slick street not
far from the Champs-Éilysées and slid past a dully glowing
neon sign that read HÔTEL WASHINGTON. I had not
seen that hotel in nearly thirty-five years, since the
spring of 1952, when for several nights it had become
my initial Parisian roosting place. In the first few
months of my <i>Wanderjahr</i>, I had come down to Paris by
train from Copenhagen, and landed at the Hôtel Washington
through the whimsical determination of a New
York travel agent. In those days the hotel was one of the
many damp, plain hostelries made for tourists, chiefly
American, of very modest means who, if they were like
me--colliding nervously for the first time with the

It reappeared, however, that October night when I
passed the gray stone façade in a drizzle, and the recollection
of my arrival so many years before started
flooding back, causing me to feel that I had come
fatally full circle. I recall saying to myself that when I
left Paris for New York the next morning it would be
a matter of forever. I was shaken by the certainty with
which I accepted the idea that I would never see France
again, just as I would never recapture a lucidity that
was slipping away from me with terrifying speed.

Only days before I had concluded that I was suffering
from a serious depressive illness, and was floundering
helplessly in my efforts to deal with it. I wasn't
cheered by the festive occasion that had brought me to
France. Of the many dreadful manifestations of the
disease, both physical and psychological, a sense of
self-hatred--or, put less categorically, a failure of self-esteem
--is one of the most universally experienced
symptoms, and I had suffered more and more from a
general feeling of worthlessness as the malady had progressed.
My dank joylessness was therefore all the more
ironic because I had flown on a rushed four-day trip to
Paris in order to accept an award which should have
sparklingly restored my ego. Earlier that summer I
received word that I had been chosen to receive the
Prix Mondial Cino del Duca, given annually to an
artist or scientist whose work reflects themes or principles
of a certain "humanism." The prize was established
in memory of Cino del Duca, an immigrant
from Italy who amassed a fortune just before and after
World War II by printing and distributing cheap magazines,
principally comic books, though later branching
out into publications of quality; he became
proprietor of the newspaper <i>Paris-Jour</i>. He also produced
movies and was a prominent racehorse owner,

The Prix Mondial Cino del Duca has become greatly
respected in France--a nation pleasantly besotted with
cultural prizegiving--not only for its eclecticism and
the distinction shown in the choice of its recipients but
for the openhandedness of the prize itself, which that
year amounted to approximately $25,000. Among the
winners during the past twenty years have been Konrad
Lorenz, Alejo Carpentier, Jean Anouilh, Ignazio
Silone, Andrei Sakharov, Jorge Luis Borges and one
American, Lewis Mumford. (No women as yet, feminists
take note.) As an American, I found it especially
hard not to feel honored by inclusion in their company.

Depression is a disorder of mood, so mysteriously
painful and elusive in the way it becomes known to the
self--to the mediating intellect--as to verge close to
being beyond description. It thus remains nearly in-comprehensible
to those who have not experienced it
in its extreme mode, although the gloom, "the blues"
which people go through occasionally and associate
with the general hassle of everyday existence are of
such prevalence that they do give many individuals a
hint of the illness in its catastrophic form. But at the
time of which I write I had descended far past those
familiar, manageable doldrums. In Paris, I am able to

On the day of the award ceremony, which was to
take place at noon and be followed by a formal luncheon,
I woke up at midmorning in my room at the
Hôtel Pont-Royal commenting to myself that I felt
reasonably sound, and I passed the good word along to
my wife, Rose. Aided by the minor tranquilizer Halcion,
I had managed to defeat my insomnia and get a
few hours' sleep. Thus I was in fair spirits. But such
wan cheer was an habitual pretense which I knew
meant very little, for I was certain to feel ghastly before
nightfall. I had come to a point where I was
carefully monitoring each phase of my deteriorating
condition. My acceptance of the illness followed several
months of denial during which, at first, I had
ascribed the malaise and restlessness and sudden fits of
anxiety to withdrawal from alcohol; I had abruptly
abandoned whiskey and all other intoxicants that June.

At any rate, during the few hours when the depressive
state itself eased off long enough to permit the
luxury of concentration, I had recently filled this vacuum
with fairly extensive reading and I had absorbed
many fascinating and troubling facts, which, however,
I could not put to practical use. The most honest
authorities face up squarely to the fact that serious depression

In my reading I had learned, for example, that in at
least one interesting respect my own case was atypical.
Most people who begin to suffer from the illness are
laid low in the morning, with such malefic effect that
they are unable to get out of bed. They feel better only
as the day wears on. But my situation was just the

What I did not say, and which was no joke, was that

Simone del Duca, a large dark-haired woman of
queenly manner, was understandably incredulous at
first, and then enraged, when after the presentation
ceremony I told her that I could not join her at lunch
upstairs in the great mansion, along with a dozen or so
members of the Académie Françise, who had chosen
me for the prize. My refusal was both emphatic and
simpleminded; I told her point-blank that I had arranged
instead to have lunch at a restaurant with my
French publisher, Françoise Gallimard. Of course this
decision on my part was outrageous; it had been announced
months before to me and everyone else concerned
that a luncheon--moreover, a luncheon in my
honor--was part of the day's pageantry. But my behavior
was really the result of the illness, which had
progressed far enough to produce some of its most
famous and sinister hallmarks: confusion, failure of
mental focus and lapse of memory. At a later stage my
entire mind would be dominated by anarchic disconnections;
as I have said, there was now something that
resembled bifurcation of mood: lucidity of sorts in the
early hours of the day, gathering murk in the afternoon

Madame del Duca was magnanimous in accepting
my apology and the lunch went off without further
strain, although I couldn't completely rid myself of the
suspicion, as we chatted somewhat stiffly, that my

The pain persisted during my museum tour and
reached a crescendo in the next few hours when, back
at the hotel, I fell onto the bed and lay gazing at the
ceiling, nearly immobilized and in a trance of supreme
discomfort. Rational thought was usually absent from
my mind at such times, hence <i>trance</i>. I can think of no
more apposite word for this state of being, a condition
of helpless stupor in which cognition was replaced by

And zombielike, halfway through the dinner, I lost
the del Duca prize check for $25,000. Having tucked
the check in the inside breast pocket of my jacket, I let
my hand stray idly to that place and realized that it
was gone. Did I "intend" to lose the money? Recently
I had been deeply bothered that I was not deserving of
the prize. I believe in the reality of the accidents we
subconsciously perpetrate on ourselves, and so how
easy it was for this loss to be not loss but a form of
repudiation, offshoot of that self-loathing (depression's
premier badge) by which I was persuaded that I could
not be worthy of the prize, that I was in fact not
worthy of any of the recognition that had come my way
in the past few years. Whatever the reason for its disappearance,
the check was gone, and its loss dovetailed
well with the other failures of the dinner: my failure to
have an appetite for the grand <i>plateau de fruits de mer</i>
placed before me, failure of even forced laughter and,
at last, virtually total failure of speech. At this point
