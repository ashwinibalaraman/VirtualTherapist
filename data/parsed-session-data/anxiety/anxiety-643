I guess it's true. You can't have it both ways unless you're fucked up.
If you're not fucked up you <i>can have everything you need with one person</i>.
You can surrender yourself without feeling you're held prisoner.


It doesn't matter to me much anymore what other people want
or say is the right way to feel about love. I know what I want. I want
to stop wanting what I don't have. I want to feel, for once, grateful
and able to love someone fully. I want to accept someone without
looking to make them something they aren't. I want to finally admit
to myself that I'm good enough to be loved. I'm getting tired of the
chase. I'm getting tired of the manipulation. I'm feeling stupid thinking
I'm not being who I really am. I'm exhausted from looking for
someone who <i>won't</i> tell me what they want from me. I'm gloomy
over the prospect of thinking that I always need new prospects. But
I think I'm just about at the end of my rehearsal at being a man.


"Ready, Mr. Lewis?"


"How's the crowd?"


"Sold out."


"Really?"


"Are you kidding me, Mr. Lewis? It's standing room only."


"No shit... Hmm... That's nice... That's, uh, cool."


"Are you all right? Want me to hold the curtain? You need a
drink?"


"Huh? Oh, no. Ha! That's funny. No, I'm cool, really... I'm just a

"No kidding?"


"Yeah. She once told me that she felt that what you really needed
was a good long hug from a good woman."


"She said that?"


"Yeah. She worries about you. Tell you the truth, it pissed me off
a little. I got a little jealous but now that I had the honor to meet you
it doesn't bother me as much."


"I'm glad."


"So, you ready?"


"Yeah... Tell me something. How long have you been married?"


"Me?"


"Yeah."


"You really want to know?"


"Yeah."


"Let's see, Joanie and I will be married...holy shit...twenty-eight
fuckin' years, pardon my French, this September sixth."


"Isn't that something. Are you happy?"


"Mr. Lewis, I really think you should get out there."


"Seriously. Are you happy?"


"You really care?"


"Yeah."


"I'm the luckiest motherfucker on the planet. I mean she has her
faults and stuff but if she stuck with <i>me</i>, I mean, shit, I'm one lucky
motherfucker."


"Good for you. Okay, get me out there."


"You got it, Mr. Lewis...you'll be great. They all came for you."


"I know. Mind if I ask you a personal question?"


"Anything Mr. Lewis."


"Did you ever fuck around?"


"Not once."


"I'm ready."
