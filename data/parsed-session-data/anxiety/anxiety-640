<font size="4"><b>Marry Her, Asshole</b></font>

It's near the end of the millennium and I'm near the end of my fear-of-intimacy
rope. I have experienced tidbits of closeness with many
women but what I've experienced much more is fear. Fear of being
swallowed up. Fear of being criticized. Fear of never doing enough.
Fear of her leaving me, out of the blue, for reasons she can't explain.
Fear of being fearful that I don't deserve to be with someone I
dig. Fear of having double the fear because I'll become guilt-ridden
and take over her fear of me leaving her. Fear of being funny when
the moment maybe didn't call for it and being chastised for it. Fear of
basically never being myself again, even though I've never really

I think it was FDR who said, "There is nothing to fear but fear
itself." Thanks again, Mr. President, for nothing. Not only did you
react tragically slowly in recognizing Hitler's atrocities but now I can
just hear your booming voice, once again blundering, this time on a
much smaller scale, and making people like me feel that being riddled
with fear is simply a walk in the park. What bullshit! Do you
have to rub it in? You're dead. Let me live in peace with my own
fear. And let's face it, you didn't have the perfect marriage. A little
shrinkage for you and your First Lady might have been a good thing.
Unless you were too afraid. Wimp.


Presidential history aside, the lowest point in my confusion about
the subject of finding "the one" occurred after dating someone I was
convinced was the best woman for me, based on where I was at in
my life, that I'd ever dated; and yet I suffered through one of the
oddest, most disconcerting and humiliating events with her, an
event that wound up making me feel like I was really just full of shit
about ever truly wanting a relationship.


Two hours prior to this experience I had spent what I had
thought to be some of the most honest, revealing minutes ever with
my therapist. I had gone on and on and on and on, listing every
incredible quality my girlfriend had and how meaningful it was.
Then I went on and on and on and on about how odd it felt being
comfortable, instead of lonely and always on the make. Much to the
apparent delight of my shrink I seemed to be feeling very positive
about it being about time that I accepted love from one woman
without always being halfway out the door. I mean, I don't know if

So, the session ends. I always end it. It's a therapy quirk of mine.
I hate being told when to stop feeling. So during my visit I usually
take a few furtive glances at her many clocks, all placed perfectly
around her office so she can help me and tell the time simultaneously,
and I can boast that I have always started to leave her office
before she has ever said, to the best of my recollection, "We have to
stop now."


Anyway, moments later I was in my car, trying not to dangerously
daydream too much as I am prone to do when feeling
euphoric after great, eye-opening sessions. Over the years I have
come frightfully close to running down pedestrians simply because I
was light-headed with enlightenment and somehow driving without
looking consciously through the windshield.


Then it happened. The disease struck just like it used to when I
was mainly battling alcohol. Back then, when I thought that I could
just deal with my drinking problem by cutting back, it never failed
that as soon as I was "good" one day, I partied the next. It never
failed. I felt I deserved a reward for my maturity and abstinence the
day before. So in this instance, I was so thrilled with at least sounding
to my shrink like an honest-to-goodness adult in a loving relationship,
I again felt deserving of a nasty reward, and must have
unconsciously put out my antenna while driving back in search of
any hot woman, in any car, in any crosswalk, at any intersection,
just to take my mind off of all that growth and perhaps get myself in
trouble like always.


It didn't take long. There she was. Although it was a little past
twilight I saw enough of this beauty's profile to slam on the brakes of
any maturity I might have displayed just moments before in front of
my doctor. Her windows were a little tinted in what looked like

I drove like the crazy man I am, weaving in and out of traffic, trying
to create a simultaneous stop for both our cars at the nearest
traffic light. I'm occasionally good in bed but I'm even better at this.
I made it. No ticket. No guilt. Total excitement. The rush was there. I
stared shamelessly at this woman's car—it was rapidly getting dark
and the stunning shadows made her look even more beautiful
through her passenger window. I prayed that she would open it. I
didn't care if she recognized me nor did I know what I would say. I
knew only that there was a chance that if she really blew me away,
and smiled back at me, I might ask her to pull over, and worry about
the shame and guilt later.


She made it easy. Her electric window came down real fast. I was
in a state of shock. She was amazing-looking. I knew my insane car
chase hadn't been in vain, but for a whole different reason. The fantasy
woman was my own girlfriend. I didn't recognize her vehicle,
but it had to be pretty obvious to her by the look on my face that I
hadn't had a clue it was her, until she'd opened her window.


She started to laugh and just before the light changed she asked,
"So, just how long was it until you knew it was me?"


I immediately lied: "Oh, please honey, don't be ridiculous."


"Uh-huh," she said with a smirk, then added, "I'll speak to you
later."


I was humiliated. Caught with my pants down in rush-hour traffic.
The horndog without his clothes. Move over, Mr. Emperor. I'm
center stage now. This was a first. I tried to pick up my own chick.
Holy shit! What was that all about? I was flabbergasted. I mean, the

When I got home I finally admitted that I hadn't known it was
her, and being the cool woman she is she was flattered and mocked
me a little. Although she did ask me what I would have done if it
wasn't her. I told her I didn't know. I guess my honesty pushed her
into admitting that for a few seconds before she opened her window,
she didn't know it was me either. Cool, but she hardly risked her life
in traffic chasing after a fantasy mate who could have been married,
a lesbian, a leper, an escaped mental patient—anyone. But it was my
own woman! I'd hit on my own woman.


I felt pathetic. And then a few days later I ran into some rock star
acquaintance of mine, who in his prime must have had a zillion
women and a whole world of unknown wet female fans from every
country wanting him. I told him the story. He chuckled for a second,
knowing me pretty well and how tortured I was being with one
woman, and then he got this really thoughtful, yet sorry look on his
face. He said one sentence and split.


"Marry her, asshole."
