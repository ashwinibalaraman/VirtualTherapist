I slept late again. After last night's associations I lay back
on my soft bed and fell into a state of blissful relaxation. The
wise doctor's methods are working. I haven't seen a spider in a
long time.


I woke up about 2 P.M. when there was a knock at the door.
I got out of bed and opened the door and there was the wise
doctor, a little out of breath from his tiring hike up seven flights
of stairs. "I don't care much for these newfangled elevators,"
the wise doctor explained, entering my room and sitting down
on the edge of the bed I had just vacated to catch his breath.
"No, I can't say as I do; a flight of stairs is safer; I don't trust
those certificates of inspection they put in those contraptions
that lift you up to your floor so fast your stomach drops away
beneath you."


I wondered if the wise doctor had a little touch of claustrophobia.
But I guess we all have our troubles of one sort or
another, even eminent Viennese physicians.


"You shouldn't really write the things about this city you
do, you know," the wise doctor tells me, after he's caught his
breath. "They're not trueâ€”all those accusations you make about
human beings which are really spiders and little white blobs in
the place of human beings. Not true at all. This is a very nice
city. I never enjoyed a more invigorating walk in my life than
the one I had this morning while you were asleep. You really
ought to get up earlier, instead of sleeping through the best
hours the way you do. Then you would find out you really live
in quite a nice town."

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Oh," I say, hoping to leave it at that, just a simple one
word answer; but I can't; my unconscious hatreds won't let me,
"You see only the good side," I said. "What about the perverse
lip-smiles you find on every other corner; the perverts walking
around with their ugly thoughts; the vicious gleam of sadism I
read in so many eyes every time I go out for a walk; what about
all that? Surely you've seen it too."


The wise doctor laughs again. Long and loud. His sense of
humor never fails him at these points and he knows that this is
the best therapy for many of my suspicions. "Nonsense," he
says, after the laughter has died down. The joyful laughter that
woke up my sleeping bunny and filled his big round eyes with
sparkling lights I had never seen in them before; that woke up
the big bunny and caused him to come over to the laughing
physician with a single bound and stick his big head under
that large weather-beaten arm of the wise physician; under that
strong skilled arm that knew how to hold a delicate hypodermic
needle in just the right way, but also knew how to hold onto
the rocks and the crags when he wanted to climb up to a higher
ledge during a mountaineering expedition. So Freud sat there,
on the edge of my bedspread, with his arm around the giant
bunny, and the laughter died down.


"Nonsense," he repeats; "I met some charming people in my
walk this morning. An old man asked me if I could spare a few
cents for a breakfast he was planning to buy himself, after he
collected enough pennies. I told him I didn't have a cent to my
name, flat broke, hadn't seen a wealthy client in years. But he
started to talk to me anyway. We talked for a long time.
Talked about the world and its problems and ourselves and our
own little anxieties. Then I took him to a restaurant I know of,
where I had a meal for nothing the other day. The proprietor
was very nice to me when I told him our predicament and gave
us both a couple of steaming bowls of hot soup and some rye
bread and a couple of huge slices of swiss cheese. He told us
to pretend we were giving him the money for it, so we did.
And the soup was out of this world; I haven't tasted anything
like it for ages. So you see it's all a mistake; all these thoughts

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So I promised the wise doctor I would take his advice, but
they were there, in my unconscious, the curled lips and the
phony voices and the perverted minds. I would work on it
though. Maybe I could get over them if I tried. Wipe them out.
Destroy them where they lived and had their home base, in my
own subconscious mind. The big bunny knows I'm working at
it. He looks over at me from his resting place under the sure
and comforting arm of the wise doctor and his head tilts a little
to one side in an expression of curiosity. Trying to guess what
I'm doing. Then he realizes I'm fighting the unconscious masochism
and his eyes go soft and downy with approval. He knows
I'm doing the right thing.


"Did you have any dreams while I was gone?" the wise
doctor said, after the humor had died down and his face
became serious again, and he pulled out the little pad in his
pocket, to take down my dream for future reference.


"Yes, I did," I reply, remembering them suddenly. I had
forgotten my dreams until he asked me. Then I remembered
them in a flash. It's something in the wise doctor's voice. He
can pull up memories with his questions that our own conscious
minds would never be able to remember, unaided. His voice is
so sharp and sure; so unwilling to admit defeat; so positive the
answers will come when he asks his questions in that rapid-fire
tone of intellectual authority.


"I dreamt I was back in the hospital again," I say. "It was
an unpleasant dream, a little nightmarish around the edges."


"That's good," the wise doctor replied, not taking his eyes
off the notes he is writing with a small black ball-point pen.


"Why is that good?" I ask, a little surprised that a nightmare
should be a good sign.


"Well," Dr. Freud answers, gazing up from his pad and
looking into my eyes for a second, but not seeing the blue iris
at all, or the white cornea. Seeing right through in a flash, as

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well," he continues, "we know that you have a problem
of paranoid anxiety. Now the dream can often act as a very
effective anxiety discharger, if you will pardon the strange
expression. The dream has a way of getting rid of all the surplus
anxiety that we cannot cope with in real life. You see how
necessary to our well-being our dreams are? If we go around
during the daytime afraid of invisible guns and vicious enemies
standing on every street corner, then the dream can cope with
these fears that the waking mind cannot do anything about.
We repress our anxiety and our paranoid suspicions into the
unconscious. Then the dream releases them. Releases as much
of them as it can, so they will not bother us any longer. It
does this in the form of an unpleasant dream, or, if the dream
has a lot of anxiety to cope with, in the form of a nightmare.
The dream is unpleasant, but it is better to have an unpleasant
dream and discharge our fears somehow, than to let the paranoia
grow and cause us mental difficulties."


"But if my fears are of guns and spiders, why did I dream
of a hospital setting in my nightmare, where, according to you,
I feel myself safe and sound."


"It is all part of the distortion process," the wise doctor
replies. "We cannot admit we dreamt of our real fears, when
the actual truth is we did just that. On a deeper level you were
dreaming about the spiders and the guns; but your conscious
mind works even in your dreams, and you changed the guns and
spiders into a hospital setting, so the dream would not be as
nightmarish as it might have been. You also dreamt about the
hospital because it is far away. Again we see a wish fulfillment
at work in your dream. You placed your danger far away in
the dream to reassure yourself that your fears were actually a
long distance from you. You changed the spiders and guns into
a hospital and then you put the hospital far away from you;
you made your hospital the place over on the East coast where
you used to live; so then you felt safer and more secure and the
danger became less imminent. The anxiety was discharged in

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I guess so," I said, feeling a little easier about the whole
thing, and deciding the wise doctor might have been right.
Perhaps the dream-distortion process <i>was</i> a healthy mechanism.
Maybe my little nightmare had done me some good.


"But I'm sure your old friends back in the Eastern hospital
would be a little upset if they found out you were trying to
make their pleasant residence a symbol for spiders and hostile
guns," Freud said, laughing a little at the thought, and digging
his subtle fingers into the soft fur of the big bunny's neck and
giving our rabbit friend a free massage with those skillful
Viennese fingers.


There is a short silence and all I can hear for a while are the
cars out in the streets, silent cars, moving smoothly to their
destinations without any frantic blares of a horn to frighten
away the black spiders. For the spiders are all gone now. The
big white bunny and the wise physician have gotten rid of them
all.


"I think we were going to talk a little about your mother,
if I remember correctly," the wise physician said, bringing me
back to the analysis we had started last night.


"Yes," I said, wondering what he had up his sleeve. I've
been asked about my mother so many times by so many psychiatrists
I hardly see how the wise physician can come up with
anything new.


But he does. He looks up at me and suddenly the strange
words are coming from those thin skillful lips which have solved
more than one patient's problems with the amazing words they
form and thrust into the unexpectant ears of the waiting
audience.


"When was the first time your mother spanked you?" the
wise doctor asks, the words reaching my ears and causing a
reaction of shock which reverberates through the vast network
of nerve cells that make up a human brain, mine included.


I do not say anything for a little while. I just try to absorb

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I don't think she ever spanked me," I replied at last. "At
least I cannot ever remember her having occasion to do so."


"Ahhhh ..." the wise doctor replied, smiling. "That is what
we all like to think, but it is simply not true. It is so much
wishful thinking on our part. Every mother punishes her children
at one time or another, though she may not ever remember
doing so and her children might have completely forgotten the
occasions.


"I do remember that she was very strict, though, sometimes,"
I said, trying to make at least some contribution to the conversation
and supply the wise doctor with some evidence for him to
work with.


"How do you mean?" he inquires with an inquisitive glance
of the black flashing eyes.


"Well, we were all scared of her temper as children. Myself
and my brother and sister. My brother got the worst of it
usually, though now we all say he was spoiled. His father
spoiled him a little, but mother was always spanking him for
getting into too much mischief."


"Now we have something to work with," the wise doctor
said, a smile effusing his features and a look of peace easing the
worried look that had heretofore been knitting his high massive
brow into a number of thin wrinkles. "Did you ever see your
brother being spanked?" he asks.


"Yes, a number of times," I reply, unable to understand as
yet the motivation behind all this unexpected line of analysis.


"Have you read my little essay called â€˜A Child Is Being
Beatenâ€™?" the wise doctor asks.


"No. I haven't even heard of it," I reply, a little shamefully.


"No, I guess you haven't," the wise doctor answers, looking
over at my long line of books with a number of titles blessed
by his authorship. "I notice you only have my well-known
writings here. My books. <i>Interpretation of Dreams, Psychopathology
of Everyday Life, Civilization and its Discontents</i>.
You probably haven't read any of my essaysâ€”which is a shame.

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The wise doctor is silent a few minutes, thinking about the
old days. Thinking of sunny Vienna and the peddlers taking
their horses and carts down the cobbled streets. Thinking of the
cold light of truth that came to him there, in the university,
when he was all wrapped up in neurology and becoming famous
for his papers on the behavior of the nervous system in animals
and in man. Becoming famous, but Brucke could not find a
place for him in the university as a neurologist, and he had to
leave. Left for France and Paris and the little cafÃ©s glowing in
the light of the fading evening sun and the girls and boys
sitting around the little patio-tables with their wine and their
laughter and their poetry. For Paris and an introduction to
Charcot, the greatest authority in the field of hysterical pathology.
Charcot, who found that the simple process of posthypnotic
suggestion could cure more cases of hysteria than all
the surgeon's knives in Europe. And back to Vienna, with the
old hypnotist's experiments ringing in his heart and new convictions
of his own concerning the treatment of mental disorder.
Back to Vienna and the laughter and the scorn and the ridicule,
as he propounded his theories of the suggestive power of our
unconscious mind and the psychic basis in the neurotic illnesses;
the psychic and the sexual components in the human ego, which
could come to the surface and undergo a healthy transformation
by the simple process of free association. And the scorn he met
with when he told the medical profession of his theories and his
experiments with the new method. The scorn, until a few
people began to understand. A handful only, but at least there
was a start. And the cold nights when they would all gather
around the stove in the room they had rented to talk over
the science of psychoanalysis. Jung and Adler and Rank and
Wilhelm Stekel and Theodor Reik; Hanns Sachs and Sandor
Ferenczi; and Karl Abraham. All gathered in a circle, and the
revolutionary new ideas and insights flying around the small,

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Back to Vienna and his family. His sons and daughters and
the long hikes up the German mountain ranges. And his children
coming to him with their childhood dreams. The soft innocent
dreams of childhood, that flit through our minds like sparks of
light and hope in the joyful beginnings of our infancy.


Back to Vienna and his practice. And the patients who
would argue with him and tell him they did not dare continue
their visits because their relatives disapproved of the interpretations
he was making of their neuroses. But some of them understood
and stuck with him and provided him with the empirical
evidence he was looking for. For the evidence and the cures and
the restored lives and the new minds, when all the memories
had come to the surface and the ego had been reconstructed
and made strong again.


And then the war and Jung splitting off and going his own
way with his theory of archetypes and religious dream symbols.
And Adler leaving too with his theories of an ego psychology
independent of the unconscious instincts. Most of them leaving,
in fact, and going into their own paths. He had given them all
birth. Without him, they would never have made any kind of
a name for themselves. But all children leave home at one point
or another, and psychoanalysts are no exception.


And the traumatic neuroses induced by the thousands by the
horrors of the war. And the necessity of looking for a death
instinct in the unconscious to couple with the erotic instinct.
And the second war, the new dictatorship, the flight to England.
And the eventual recognition, the eventual respect and veneration
he knew would one day be his. Letters from everywhere,
from all over the world; they had all conceded and granted him
the discoveries he knew he had made. The letter from Romain
Rolland, the French author of poetic prose and beautiful biographies.
The letters from Einstein and the urge to strike up a
basis for lasting peace on the basis of intellectual foundations
alone. And the peaceful English countryside in the spring when

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could see all these dreams and others flitting over the tired
eyes of the wise doctor, who had consented to spend a few
days with me, analyzing my problem, and offering his solutions.
And I knew this was one of them, sharing these memories with
me. Letting me see them flit across those dark eyes with their
lights and shadows, heart pains and joys, defeats and victories.
Snaring it all with me. Snowing me we are all human, even
renowned psychoanalysts, and we all have our heartaches and
our pains, our moments of joy, our memories which are so
important to us. It is part of life. Part of the process of life I
must try to adjust to; and the wise doctor is starting the adjustment
going with his reveries and the consolation that is in them.


"But we must get back to the analysis," he says at last,
disappointing the big bunny a little, who had been taking in all
these memories. His large downy eyes growing dreamy as he
listened, and perhaps half hoping, in that big bunny heart of his
that the wise doctor would go on dreaming of the past forever.
For even though the wise doctor was not speaking with his
lips, the big bunny had his own secret way of taking all the
wise doctor's memories into that vast dark brain. Taking it in
and letting the little cobbled Viennese side streets find their
place with the Arctic regions of snow and the cold glittering
stars, by some remarkable process of synthesis that only a
beautiful bunny can understand or accomplish.

<b>March 12, 11:30 P.M.</b>

"Here's some food for your paranoia," the wise doctor says,
after going out for a cup of coffee somewhere and coming back
with a copy of the day's newspaper. I look at the headlines.
Something about Castro. Then, in the smaller headlines, the ones
over the individual columns, I find they have discovered a dead
rat, infected with plague.

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I thought this kind of thing only happened in the middle
ages," I said, feeling the paranoia grow a little.


"Nothing to worry about, young man," the wise doctor
assures me, placing a hand on my shoulder and reading the
news column with me. "You see, it says further down, that
there hasn't been a death from the plague since 1909, and all the
while there have been animals dying from it without infecting
human beings. Nothing to worry about."


But I remember a movie with Richard Widmark where they
had a similar problem and kept the danger silent and kept the
deaths silent, restraining the papers from publishing warning
signals, until the whole thing was over, so there wouldn't be
any panic. I want to tell the wise doctor about this movie but
he seems to read my thoughts.


"Oh, I know what you're thinking," the wise doctor says
with a laugh. "You've probably seen one of those movies on
the subject. No, no," he continues, laughing a little, "no, those
movies don't know anything about it; they're written that way
to give the public a little thrill by throwing in a little fiction to
scare them. No, no, no, young man," the wise doctor continues,
"you are much too suggestible. That is part of the paranoic
mechanism, suggestibility. Fiction becomes reality. Anything
anyone tells you becomes the gospel truth. You know this
yourself. You talk about it in the first sections of your associations.
That's no good, my boy. You can't write about the
danger of suggestion and then remain as suggestible as anyone
else and panicking on the smallest of warning signals; no, you
must believe what you write, if you think it is the truth. Otherwise
your written words are in vain. Not the spiders and the
guns which you admit you write out of your own imagination.
But the hypothesis you present that suggestibility may be an
important factor in mental illness. It is important. You are perfectly
correct to say so in your associations, young man. But
you cannot say so with the typewriter and say something else
with your own heart. That doesn't work. That is no help at all."


I guess he is right and try to forget about my fears and the
movies I watched a month or so ago on my eighteen-inch TV

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I am digressing, myself, and the wise doctor knows it.
"Come on," he says. "Enough of this plague paranoia and any
recent movies you might have seen on your television set. We've
got to continue with the analysis."


So we continue.


"Now, my good man, what were we talking about? Oh yes!
Your mother and your amnesia concerning your first punishments
and your remembrance of how she would spank your
brother when he got too mischievous, or something along that
order."


"Yes, that was it," I say, having forgotten where we were

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes. Yes I was," the wise doctor continues. "Well you
ought to read that essay some day, young man, if you get the
chance. In it I point out the mental reactions that take place
when one member of a family sees another one being punished."


"You mean I felt guilty and repressed the guilt I felt at
enjoying the spectacle and now the guilt is coming up in the
form of paranoia?" I asked.


"Yes, yes. That is part of it. You saw your brother being
punished and felt guilty. That explains your guilt complex. Why
you are always identifying with the suffering members of
society instead of the pleasure-loving members. You still haven't
gotten over the guilt associated with your childhood memories.


"But it isn't the guilt that interests us most. This is secondary.
The more important emotion is the envy and jealousy you
experience in the incident."


"Envy?" I ask, puzzled.


"Yes. The guilt is there. And explains why you felt guilty
about leaving the Eastern hospital and why you got a case of
paranoia after your discharge. You thought your fellow patients,
whom you left behind you at the hospital, were being punished
for their sickness, the same way your brother was punished by
your mother. You felt guilty upon your discharge as you felt
guilty when you yourself reached the age when you no longer
needed to be punished by your mother and were allowed to
watch your younger siblings receive their punishment. You see
the analogy? Eventually you grew up in the hospital as you
grew up as a child. And you no longer required the therapy
that the other patients still required. You identified the patients
that are still there, or still living in mental hospitals, with your
own younger brother, and felt guilty over being no longer of
the mental age to require such treatment as your fellow patients
must still receive. You were too old now to be spanked, to put
it symbolically. But you were not too old to suffer. The guilt
was there because there are still your brethren among the mentally

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But the guilt, as I said before, is secondary. The envy is
primary. You see when we no longer need our parents' disciplinary
guidance, we actually have a more serious problem on
our hands than we expected. The process of maturation is not
a bed of roses. When our parents no longer guide us, we must
guide ourselves. And this might seem to us at times even more
difficult than our early ability to rely on our parents. And the
problem of handling our own emotions and controlling our own
lives often seems very difficult compared to those early days
when our parents settled the matter for us, swiftly and surely,
with the blow of their hands or maybe a leather belt if we were
too unruly. Sometimes the punishment of others is far more
easy to bear than the punishment of our own mind, of our
superego, of our own conscious mind fighting to control the
unruly instincts of our unconscious self. Mental discipline is the
hardest discipline of all to attain and sometimes we would all
like to regress to the time when someone else took care of all
our disciplinary problems with a few sharp blows, and we did
not have to do anything but behave in such a way that the
blows would be as few as possible. But the blows of life, young
man, are much more powerful than the blows our parents can
ever give us; and they require much more will power on our
part, to find out the correct behavior which will keep these
blows down to a minimum.


"So you see where the envy comes in, young man? In a
sense you envy your old friends at the hospital, because their
disciplinary problem is very simple. Although their problem is
not really a disciplinary one as I have already stated, though
this is not of consequence; the important thing is you feel that
a hospital serves a disciplinary purpose and you compare this
disciplinary purpose with the role once played in your life by

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"In a way, the paranoia represents a desire to regress. In a
way you wish these imaginary guns would become real and
they would cart you off to the police station and lock you up
as you imagine in your paranoid fantasies. Why? Because you
would identify the punishment of society with the punishment
your mother gave you when you were so young you couldn't
remember what was happening, but not too young to realize
that your mother really loved you and was taking care of your
welfare. Do you see what I'm driving at?"


"Yes," I answer. "It all makes a good deal of sense. So where
do I go from here?"


"Nowhere, in particular," the wise doctor replies, trying to
keep the analysis on an even keel, and not rush the cure.


"It is sufficient for the moment that you understand what
I am saying and I think you do," the wise doctor says with a
smile, stroking the big furry presence beside him which is now
sound asleep. The big bunny knows I am safe in the guiding
hands of the wise physician and do not need the help of his
smooth-running electronic computers stored away in that big
starlit brain, for the time being, at any rate. He knows the wise
doctor's quick dark eyes can see as well as his own soft downy
gaze, and so he is taking it easy for a while.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Will it help my paranoia then, just to understand what you
have told me?" I inquire.


"I'm sure it will," the wise doctor replies. "Not immediately
perhaps. It will take a little time. But even if you do not notice
any immediate changes, or cannot grasp all the things I have
said at once; even if this is the case, you will soon start to feel
better. The fact that you have agreed to listen to my analysis is
already a step in the right direction and will bring its own
reward. Analysis always takes time. A mental cure is never an
overnight process."


"Yes, I agree," I say, remembering that it is two years now
that I have had this paranoia. Had it continually. Sometimes it
goes away for a few days but it always comes back. But now I
feel a little hope. Not much, but a little. I begin to feel a little
strength inside that I had not yet experienced. A little confidence
that I have the power to lick this problem of paranoia
and unconscious masochism. That I was only lacking the proper
tools for the job, and that these tools are now being given me,
by the wise and skillful hands of the wise doctor, who is still
employing those talented hands in soothing the big bunny and
inducing a peaceful sleep in the large bunny's mind by a few
deftly applied strokes over that vast coat of snowy fur. Which
melts and becomes warm and living and real under the knowledgeable
hands of the wise doctor.
