<font size="4"><b>Chapter 12: Stress, Coping, and Family Health</b></font>

The ways in which people cope is
the most significant mediating
factor in determining consequences
of life stress on their health (Bomar,
1996). To date, much of the stress, coping, and
health research has focused on the individual
as the unit of analysis. Rarely, however, does a
person manage life's demands on his or her
own. Individuals also belong to a family, and it
is within this context that they deal with day-to-day
life stressors. Of necessity, what the individual
does or feels can affect the whole
family unit, just as the family unit is an important
influence on individual behavior. Pender
(1996) wrote,
<blockquote>

Health values, attitudes, and behaviors are

health in the family value structure and the

Helping families to learn to cope successfully
with the stressors that they face in their day-to-day
lives is a formidable task as family
practitioners examine the many perspectives
and interpretations of family stress, coping,
and health. In this chapter, theoretical models
of family stress, coping, and health are detailed
and critiqued. Conceptual definitions
are presented, issues of measurement and
logical and empirical adequacy are reviewed,
and the contributions of respective research
findings to nursing knowledge are evaluated.

- <b>TRADITIONAL FRAMEWORKS
OF FAMILY STRESS, COPING,
AND HEALTH</b>


Interest in family stress and coping originated
within the social sciences. Formal theorizing

[p. <i>296</i>]

On the basis of both qualitative and quantitative
longitudinal investigations conducted
on families faced with war-induced separations,
Hill's ABCX model evolved into the
double ABCX model (McCubbin &amp; Patterson,
1983a). This evolution was based on several
fundamental observations. First, in the
face of conditions of chronic stress, families,
operating as a system, are forced into a crisis
and called on to reorganize and change their
patterns of operation. Second, the ABCX factors
defined in the Hill model were not sufficient
to explain the variability in postcrisis
family functioning involving reorganization
and recovery. Therefore, additional factors
were identified. Third, the outcome of family
postcrisis behavior and processes appeared to
be that of adaptation. Families need to achieve
a different level of functioning as a result of
changes in the family system. This level of
functioning, referred to as adaptation (XX
factor), reflects the family's effort to balance
demands placed on the family unit referred to
as "pileup" (AA factor) with the family's resources
and capabilities (BB factor). Family
appraisal (CC factor) involves an overall assessment
of the family situation, including the
stressor and its hardships, changes made, the
family's capability, the compatibility of family
changes with member needs and development,
and the coordination and synergism of
these family changes with all aspects of family
functioning and system needs. Coping is
the family's operating arm for producing these
changes, reducing tension, and achieving family
harmony and balance.


With the added focus on the family processes
involved in adaptation, namely, the
family's postcrisis behaviors, the double
ABCX model took on a subsequent transformation
referred to as the Family Adjustment
and Adaptation Response (FAAR) model
(McCubbin &amp; Patterson, 1983b). In this
framework, family processes involved in adaptation
are introduced and described. The
family's movement through postcrisis recovery
involves a set of processes inclusive of
change, synergism, congruency, coordination,
assimilation, accommodation, and coping. Interestingly,
research on family protective factors
and processes emerged as the FAAR
model was being introduced and subjected to
scrutiny and additional study. Family protective
processes gained prominence as family
scientists examined the patterns of functioning
that served to protect families from being
"crisis prone" and that also served to foster
the ease of family recovery in the face of a crisis

[p. <i>297</i>]

The development and evolution of family
stress theory took another bold step with the
emergence of the Resiliency Model of Family
Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation. Not only
did risk, protective, and recovery factors gain
prominence in the resiliency model but also
the conceptual framework evolved as a result
of research on families of different ethnic
groups and cultures as well as emerging interest
in multiple levels of family appraisal found
to be relevant in understanding and explaining
family adaptation (McCubbin &amp; McCubbin,
1993; McCubbin, McCubbin, Thompson, &amp;
Thompson, 1995/1996). In the Resiliency
Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation,
the assumption that families manage
stressful situations over time emphasizes the
family's ability to recover from stressful
events and crises by drawing on patterns of
functioning, strengths, capabilities, appraisal
processes, coping, resources, and problem
solving to facilitate adaptation. Because of the
centrality of the resiliency model in the study
of family stress and coping in nursing, it is reviewed
in depth later.


Using a symbolic interactionist perspective,
Boss (1987) proposed that although the
meaning of an event to the family is the most
important factor influencing family stress, it is
the least well understood. Furthermore, because
families do not live in a vacuum, the
context of family life is critical in shaping experiences
of stress. The Contextual Model of
Family Stress (Boss, 1987) develops the concept
of family context, situated as two concentric
circles surrounding the concepts of the
ABCX model. In the innermost circle, internal
context relates to factors that the family
can change and control and includes three dimensions:
(a) structural context, including the
family boundaries, roles, and rules; (b) psychological
context — the family's perception
(both cognitive and affective) of the stressful
event; and (c) philosophical context, or the
family's values and beliefs. Unlike the internal
context, the family has little or no control
over its external context — the broader environment
in which the family is situated. This
outermost circle includes the elements of culture,
history, economics, development, and
heredity. Boss also differentiates between
family stress and crisis. Family stress is a neutral
concept that simply describes pressure experienced
by families that changes family
equilibrium in some way. Two outcomes of
stress are possible within Boss's model: crisis
or coping. Crisis is a serious disturbance in
the functioning of the family such that the
family is immobilized. Coping refers to the
family's management of the stressful event
such that there are no detrimental effects on
family members. Although this definition of
coping is tied to effectiveness or success in
management (an outcome), Boss also refers to
coping as a process of managing the stressful
situation, leading to confusion about the nature
of this concept.


Burr, Klein, and associates (1994) developed
a systems-oriented model of family
stress as a means of addressing inconsistency
between family theories that emphasize systems
processes and the deterministic assumptions
of the ABCX model and theories that
have evolved from it that have guided much of
the research about family stress and coping.
For these theorists, stress is viewed as a process
that is intrinsically linked to other family
systems processes. Family stress occurs when
usual rules for managing family life (i.e., rules

[p. <i>298</i>]

In summary, this brief overview of family
stress and coping theories that have evolved
within social science provides a glimpse into
foundational work in this area. For in-depth
descriptions of these theories, the reader is directed
to the original texts. Although much
theorizing about family stress and coping
evolved from the ABCX model, there is a
clear indication that scholarship within this
domain is shifting its focus to consider the impact
of systems thinking, the role of family
strengths and resiliency, and the role of context
in family stress experience. Foundational
work conducted within the social sciences has
been influential in nursing's approach to family
stress and coping. Although family stress
and coping theories that have evolved within
nursing bear some similarity to social science
perspectives, they have been less bound to
these theories and, therefore, provide unique
ways of understanding family stress and coping.


- <b>EVOLVING PERSPECTIVES
IN NURSING</b>


It is no accident that theories of family stress,
coping, and resiliency emerged within nursing.
The durability of the family system in the
face of adversity has profound implications
for both the short- and long-term health and
well-being of family members, who may be
living with disease or disability. Nurses are
challenged to promote the health and development
of both family members and the family
as a unit. In the following sections, three
theories that have advanced nursing's ability
to understand, predict, and work with families
under stress are examined. The theories
reviewed vary in both perspective and stage
of development and are presented as examples
of nursing's unique contribution to understanding
family stress and coping.


<b><i>The Resiliency Model of Family Stress,
Adjustment, and Adaptation</i></b>


<i>Origins and Evolution</i>


One of the important developments in
family stress theory is advancement of theories
that explain resiliency in the family unit.
Family resiliency theory, a natural extension
of family stress theory, was developed to shed
light on our understanding of how and why
some families, when faced with the adversity
of illnesses and traumatic conditions, are able
to cope, endure, and survive. It also plays a vital
and positive role in explaining support and
in-home care to promote the well-being of
family members who may be threatened or affected

[p. <i>299</i>]

The combined research and theory-building
efforts of nursing and family scientists,
encompassing a period of 15 years at the endowed
Institute for the Study of Resiliency in
Families and the Family Stress, Coping, and
Health Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
have resulted in the Resiliency
Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation
(McCubbin &amp; McCubbin, 1993,
1996). This framework has been used to guide
research by nursing and behavioral scientists
throughout the world working both individually
and collectively to isolate protective and
recovery factors in the family unit that may affect
physical and psychological outcomes of
family members affected by medical conditions.
In addition, the resiliency model and derived
findings have fostered the parallel research
efforts directed at the development and
testing of reliable and valid measures to assess
risk, protective, and recovery factors to be
used in family and health-related investigations.
The development of family measures to
study stress, coping, and resiliency has been
in progress for the past 20 years (McCubbin &amp;
Thompson, 1987, 1991; McCubbin, Thompson,
&amp; McCubbin, 1996; Olson et al., 1984).


<i>Resiliency and Family Nursing</i>


In the context of family nursing, <i>family
resiliency</i> is defined as the property of the
family system that enables the family unit to
respond constructively to (a) a stressor (in
combination with risk factors) and, in so doing,
maintain its positive functioning and ensure
the well-being and development of the
family unit and its members (i.e., protective),
and (b) disorganization (family crisis brought
about by a stressor in combination with risk
factors) and, in doing so, bounce back and restore
its positive functioning and ensure the
well-being and development of the family unit
and its members (i.e., recovery).


The concept of family resiliency has a
rich history embedded in the longitudinal research
on resilience in children (Werner,
1984; Werner &amp; Smith, 1982), the study of resiliency
in children at risk for adverse developmental
outcomes (Garmezy, 1991a, 1991b;
Rutter, 1990), investigations of children's
competence as a protective factor in the face
of risk situations (Garmezy, 1987; Garmezy &amp;
Masten, 1991; Luthar &amp; Zigler, 1992), and the
study of resiliency in inner-city adolescents
(Luthar, 1991; Luthar, Doernberger, &amp; Zigler,
1993).


There has been a proliferation of research
on resiliency in children and youth with investigations
designed to determine which aspects
in the family milieu emerge as central protective
factors in the development of resiliency in
children (Baldwin, 1990; Conrad &amp; Hammen,
1993; Richters &amp; Martinez, 1993; Wyman,
Cowen, Work, &amp; Parker, 1991). In the past decade,
nursing and family scientists have expanded
this earlier focus to investigate and advance
theories to explain variability in
resiliency of the family system in the face of
normative (McCubbin, 1999) and nonnormative
life events and changes (McCubbin,
McCubbin, Thompson, Han, &amp; Allen, 1997).


Drawing from two decades of family
stress, coping, and resiliency research to
which they are sustained contributors,
McCubbin and McCubbin (1993, 1996) in
collaboration with their colleagues (McCubbin
et al., 1995/1996, 1997) developed and
tested the Resiliency Model of Family Stress,
Adjustment, and Adaptation. This conceptual
framework has been used to guide both family
science and nursing studies throughout the
world. The 36 copyrighted research instruments
developed by the McCubbin and
McCubbin team and tested for reliability and
validity have been used to measure various dimensions
of the resiliency framework, particularly
risk, protective, and recovery factors.

[p. <i>300</i>]

As described previously, the Resiliency
Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation
is rooted in Hill's (1949, 1958)
ABCX model and has evolved systematically
for a period of 20 years. This evolution has
been fostered by both qualitative and quantitative
studies of families faced with life events
such as war-induced separation (McCubbin,
Dahl, Hunter, &amp; Plag, 1975), having a child
member with a chronic illness (McCubbin &amp;
McCubbin, 1993), and normative transitions
and changes (McCubbin, Thompson, Pirner,
&amp; McCubbin, 1988). The inductively derived
conceptual model of family resiliency focuses
on the role of risk, protective, and recovery
factors in the prediction and explanation of
family resiliency (McCubbin et al., 1997).
The McCubbin and McCubbin framework
seeks to explain why some families endure
life's hardships and traumas with minor adjustment
and appear to be buffered by protective
factors. The framework is also intended to
explain why families in crisis, or those who
experience disorganization and a need for
change due to life events, are able to bounce
back, recover, and adapt through the use of recovery
factors in the process of restoring,
changing, and introducing new patterns of
family functioning.


A more complete diagram of the family
resiliency model (McCubbin &amp; McCubbin,
1996), which has also been developed to have
predictive and explanatory value in the study
of families of different ethnic groups, is presented
in Figure 12.1 (adjustment phase) and
Figure 12.2 (adaptation phase).


<i>Family Adjustment:
A Short-Term Response</i>


In the face of a diagnosis and the demands
of caring for a member with an illness
or disability, the family's initial reaction is
predictably to maintain the "status quo" with
minimal changes in how the family typically
operates and behaves. In this "adjustment
phase" of the resiliency model, the family system
draws from its existing patterns of functioning,
strengths, and protective factors (e.g.
accord, hardiness, time and routines, celebrations,
and traditions). The interacting components
in this phase of family resiliency are
seen as (a) the stressor event (e.g., diagnosis,
illness, and disability); (b) the family's vulnerability
(risk factors and the pileup of concurrent
life changes, such as marital conflict,
abuse, and history of violence); (c) the family's
established patterns of functioning (e.g.,
family time and routines and family traditions);
(d) the family's resources, both internal
and external to the family unit (e.g., cohesiveness
and social support); (e) the family's appraisal
of the stressor and its severity; and (f)
the family's coping repertoire and problem-solving
communication (e.g., seeking consultation,
openness to medical advice, and seeking
support from support groups). In the short
term, the family directs its energy and does all
that is possible to keep family system changes
to a minimum and attempts to maintain
healthy functioning in the family unit. The
family seeks to maintain harmony and balance
among its four basic components — namely,
the family's interpersonal relationships, the
family's development and member well-being
(including spirituality), the family's structure
and functioning, and the family's relationship
with the community.


The confirmation of a diagnosis or disability
or both, combined with ever-increasing
demands on the family unit to modify its established
patterns of functioning, to introduce
new patterns, and to find harmony and balance
in the family system will often move the
family into a crisis situation. Family crisis is
not a pejorative term. Rather, it represents a
state of temporary disorganization accompanied
by a demand for changes in the family's
expectations, rules, and overall patterns of
functioning. At this point, the family struggles
to modify the old and introduce new patterns
of functioning to achieve family adaptation —

<i>Family Adaptation: The
Long-Term Response</i>


The level and ease of family adaptation,
according to McCubbin and McCubbin
(1988a, 1988b, 1993, 1996), is determined by
many interacting factors. These moderating
and mediating factors include the pileup of
family demands and risk factors extant to the
family unit (e.g., prior marriage with
stepchildren in the household) and its history
as well as demands created by an illness situation
(e.g., home care regimen and treatment
plans). The family continues to develop, and
normal family life cycle transitions (e.g., having
an adolescent in the home), prior strains
(e.g., conflict regarding religious beliefs and
spending money), unresolved conflicts and issues
(e.g., marital conflict), the positive and
unexpected side effects of a family's efforts to
cope (e.g., conflict because spouse takes on
additional work to make ends meet) also come
into play and influence the family's response
and adaptation. The concurrent normal and
abnormal life events (e.g., death in the extended
family) and the ambiguity regarding
what the future will hold for the family unit
must all be taken into account in evaluating
the family's capability for managing the diagnosis
and future course of treatment for the ill
member. The accumulation of life changes
and hardships determines the extent to which
the family's capabilities and protective
resources (e.g., income, psychological and interpersonal
strengths, and established patterns
of family functioning that serve to creates stability
and predictability) are disrupted, deteriorated,
drawn down, or depleted and what remains
of these patterns to be applied to
helping the family to adapt to the current family
crisis situation.


Family recovery factors are also important
in the resiliency model. Efforts to create
and adopt new and necessary patterns of functioning
are important to consider in an
assessment of family resiliency. For example,
the family's ability to comprehend and integrate
a home care medical regimen into their
pattern of functioning, while maintaining or
restoring family harmony and balance is an
important consideration in the family's ability
to achieve a satisfactory level of adaptation.
The family unit may need to establish a supportive
network of friends and associates to
help them to cope with the situation. The
medical community of physicians and nurses
may be a new part of the family's network of
support—a social group that did not exist or
that was not previously important. Family system
resources of flexibility and problem-solving
communication that ensure a mutually
supportive and encouraging rather than a
conflictual pattern of communication may become
even more important to the family unit
in a crisis situation.


The resiliency model, which also draws
from Aaron Antonovsky's exemplary theory
building and research on "sense of coherence"
(see Chapter 8 of this book) also underscores
the importance of the family's appraisal processes
in achieving a satisfactory level of family
adaptation. Families are also called on to
reconcile differences and conflicts that may
emerge when the family unit, through a trial-and-error
process, adopts patterns of functioning
to cope that may not be congruent with the
family's strongly held beliefs and values. The
family's worldview, or what McCubbin and
McCubbin (1996) call family schema, must
also be congruent with the family's newly instituted
patterns of functioning. For example,
McCubbin and McCubbin note that family
members may find meaning and value in raising
the nation's consciousness about a disease
or disability a family member may have with
the hope that more research funding could
lead to new and effective treatments. To
champion this national cause, however, may
move a family unit farther apart because some
members may be "on the road" while the remaining
members struggle to achieve balance

[p. <i>304</i>]

The family unit is also called on to give
meaning to the health problem. Family meanings
are the collective views of the family unit
cultivated, developed, and adopted (actively
and passively) by family members to render
legitimacy and acceptability to the current situation
(e.g., illness and disability). These values
relate to the family's efforts to cope, to the
family's adopted patterns of functioning, and
to the family's hopes and beliefs for the future,
given the crisis that has altered the family's
original life course to a substantial degree.


Family paradigms may also change to
give legitimacy and meaning to the new patterns
of functioning. Families may have
shaped and adopted a family paradigm for
work that affirms family members' individuality
to do what is necessary to promote their
own professional or work careers. In the face
of a family health problem, this paradigm may
be cast aside and replaced by a shared commitment
to have one member devote his/her
full-time efforts to the care of a member who
is ill or disabled with the agreement that, at
some time in the future, this member may pursue
his or her own career goals. Family paradigms,
according to the resiliency model,
serve a vital role in stabilizing and giving predictability
to the family unit. They are most
commonly created and adopted to guide the
family's central areas of functioning—
namely, the family's marital or partner communication,
sexual relationship, parenting relationship,
work and family relationships, financial
management, in-laws and relatives
relationships, and social relationships.


The resiliency model includes a family's
cultural and ethnic history that may be embedded
in the personal history of its members.
McCubbin and McCubbin (1996) argue that
culture and ethnicity play a critical role in
shaping the family's response to family crises
and the adoption of patterns of functioning
needed to achieve a satisfactory level of adaptation.
By drawing from and conducting
studies of African American, Filipino, Asian
American, and Native Hawaiian families under
stress, McCubbin and McCubbin isolate
the importance of culture and ethnicity in the
family schema (e.g., values, beliefs, and rules)
and sense of coherence (e.g., trust, control,
and manageability), both of which are confirmed
to be important to the family process of
adaptation in the face of family crises.


<i>Instrument Development and Use</i>


The Resiliency Model of Family Stress,
Adjustment, and Adaptation emerged from
and continues to be shaped by an inductive
process with research informing theory. Consequently,
the development of family measures
to study risk, protective, and recovery
factors in the process of adaptation has been
continuous since the introduction of the initial
versions of the theoretical framework in
1978. Throughout the years, the Family
Stress, Coping, and Health Project has
generated 36 reliable and valid self-report and
family system-focused research instruments.
In testing the evolving theory, a host of
family adaptation measures have been used,
including the family APGAR (Adaptation,
Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve)
(Smilkstein, 1978), FACES (Family and Cohesion
Evaluation Scales I, II, IIA, III)
(Olson, Portner, &amp; Bell, 1978, 1982), Family
Index of Regenerativity and Adaptation-General

Member Well-Being Index (McCubbin &amp;
Patterson, 1982/1996), Family Distress Index
(McCubbin, Thompson, Thompson, &amp;
McCubbin, 1993), and Family Attachment
and Changeability Index (McCubbin, Thompson,
&amp; Elver, 1995/1996a). In addition, measures
of family risk factors, family protective
factors, and family recovery factors, presented
in the book <i>family Assessment: Resiliency,
Coping adaptation—Inventories for research
and practice</i> (McCubbin, Olson, &amp;

Schema-Ethnic Inventory (McCubbin,
Thompson, Elver, &amp; Carpenter, 1992/1996)


<i>Nursing Research</i>


The evolution of nursing research using
the resiliency model resulted from the profession's
interest in exploring family change and
adaptation over time. Although the theoretical
framework had its origin in war-induced family
traumas, the resiliency model gained currency
by virtue of its relevance to the study of
families coping with many health problems,
including myelomeningocele (McCubbin,
1988a, 1989), handicaps (McCubbin, 1988b),
cystic fibrosis (McCubbin, McCubbin, Mischler,
&amp; Svavarsdottir, in press), and cerebral
palsy (McCubbin et al., 1981).


Carr (1995) affirmed the value of the resiliency
model as a guide to nursing research.
Many nursing studies have examined family
stress and adaptation within the framework of
the resiliency model. For example, the resiliency
model has been used to guide research
on families coping with acute health problems,
such as myocardial infarction (Carr,
1995), severe trauma, and head injuries
(Kosciulek, McCubbin, &amp; McCubbin, 1993;
Leske &amp; Jiricka, 1998). The model has also
been used to study family responses to
chronic childhood conditions in many contexts,
including those caring for infants with
chronic apnea at home, children with congenital
heart conditions, and children with a variety
of illnesses participating in early discharge
programs after rehabilitation (Svavarsdottir &amp;
McCubbin, 1996; Youngblut, Brennan, &amp;
Swegart, 1994). In addition, the model has
been used to examine life changes such as retirement
(Smith, 1997).


<i>Critique of Model and
Special Considerations</i>


Originally, Hill's ABCX model offered
simplicity and a charted, linear approach to
knowledge development about family stress
and family crises. McCubbin, McCubbin, and
associates (McCubbin &amp; McCubbin, 1988a,
1988b, 1996; McCubbin et al., 1997) have
made the case for looking beyond family crises.
They have fostered a line of research designed
to isolate those risk, protective, and recovery
factors that provide nursing with the
best possible predictors of family adaptation
in the face of a range of illnesses, disabilities,
and life situations. Ironically, although the
complexity of the Resiliency Model of Family
Adjustment and Adaptation has shed new
light on critical factors that shape the outcome
of family adaptation, particularly for those

[p. <i>306</i>]

As noted by the developing authors, but
also emphasized here, there is much to learn
about families under stress, including why
and under what conditions families "bounce
back." The resiliency model needs to be expanded
or competitive frameworks introduced
or both to explain the variability in perceptions
and meanings of events by the family
and individual members. Furthermore, the
contribution of daily hassles to the cluster of
risk factors that families must deal with on a
day-to-day basis needs to be examined.
Studies that address the complexity of coping
behaviors and repertoires and identify when
they serve as protective and recovery factors
in the processes of family adjustment and adaptation
are also needed. Finally, the issue of
potential deliberateness of family crises needs
to be studied. Do some families allow themselves
to enter a crisis as a planned strategy so
as to change and transform themselves for
their own good? Nursing has much to offer the
advancement of the resiliency theory as we
move toward greater understanding of family
risk, protective, and recovery factors and the
conditions under which they operate most effectively.


<i><b>The Framework of
Systemic Organization</b></i>


<i>Origin and Evolution</i>


A second family model, the Framework
of Systemic Organization, draws on principles
derived from open systems theory (Von
Bertalanffy, 1968) and social ecology (Bronfenbrenner,
1977). In contrast to other models
discussed in this chapter, its origin is not
rooted in theories of stress and coping. In fact,
neither term appears in Friedemann's theoretical
articles or textbook (Friedemann, 1989a,
1989b, 1995). Instead, the framework presents
an explanation and visualization of general
family functioning. Within the total family
process, coping is seen as a series of
actions undertaken to resolve incongruence or
disharmony within family members, between
members, and between the family and its environment.
Friedemann (1995) claims that everyone
affected feels incongruence; it can
therefore be defined as stress. Friedemann
offers the idea that coping is embedded in the
family process (Anderson &amp; Tomlinson,
1992) and suggests that coping represents the
entire family process as it unfolds day after
day. This implies that the process is indivisible
and responds to an innate, often unconscious,
need of the systems (family and individuals)
to gain congruence. Coping is not
linear or circular but rather three-dimensional
in its complexity; it is not a response to a stimulus
but rather a series of strategies of the entire
family system and its members to respond
to changes from within or from the environment.


The development of the Framework of
Systemic Organization started with the discovery
of four distinct dimensions of family
functioning as a result of a factor analysis
done for the purpose of testing an instrument
to measure family functioning (Friedemann,
1991a). Family maintenance and coherence
address the stability of the system or homeostasis,
whereas family change and individuation
refer to family growth or morphogenesis.
These four dimensions are easily detected in
family therapy literature. Homeostasis is discussed
as the outcome of two groups of behaviors.
The first, described by Bowen
(1976), represents system maintenance, or
collective behavior patterns such as decision
making, enforcing rules, caring for the sick, or
screening information. These behaviors are
grounded in a set of values and beliefs that are

[p. <i>307</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086815-I077&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br /><a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_caption_42002');">caption</a><div id="_caption_42002" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:1px solid #800000; padding:2px;">Figure 12.3. Framework of Systemic Organization</div>

Growth or morphogenesis is also easily
divided into two groups of behaviors—those
that are enacted at the family system level and
those enacted at the individual level. At the individual
level, family members engage in individuation
as they develop interests, commit
themselves to goals outside the family, and
connect with other people. At the system
level, the family then adjusts to the diversity
of its members through system change. It accepts
information from outside and integrates
<ill> by making the necessary organizational
changes (Kantor &amp; Lehr, 1975).
</ill>

In addition to stability and growth,
Friedemann complements the model with two
other systemic targets, control and spirituality.
These she conceptualized inductively by examining
her own family and nursing practice
and deductively based them on the work of
Kantor and Lehr (1975). From this perspective,
the family is seen as a system composed
of individuals and interpersonal units, all
having unique qualities of their own. The
interactions of family members occur as sequences
of acts and purposeful repetitive patterns.
The notion that family strategic patterns
are relatively stable and basic to a larger overall
family life process is central to the framework
of systemic organization (Friedemann,
1989a, 1991a). This life process is represented
graphically in Figure 12.3.


<i>The Model</i>


According to Friedemann (1995), coping
with any type of change is intimately fused
with the life processes of the family and its individuals.
All systems seek <i>congruence</i>, a
state in which all interacting systems and subsystems
function harmoniously in that their
rhythms and spatial patterns are attuned to
each other. Because change is ongoing and
occurring at a rapid pace, a state of congruence
is Utopian. Nevertheless, systems strive
to at least approach congruence to the extent
of feeling its effect as peace of mind, calmness,
and well-being. Friedemann claims that

[p. <i>308</i>]

Coping with change, therefore, pertains
to four distinct processes. The first process is
maintaining stability through the continuation
of values, traditions, and daily routines.
Growth, the second process, occurs through
adaptation and readjustment of the system's
operation to changes from within and outside.
Growth implies a change of attitudes and values
(second-order change) and not simply a
readjustment of roles and minor behaviors to
keep the family functioning (first-order
change) (Watzlawick, Weakland, &amp; Fisch,
1974). The third process is control, a reaction
to change that attempts to eliminate or minimize
threats to stability, with homeostasis being
the goal. Examples are disciplining children,
screening information, or seeking
medical care. Finally spirituality is defined as
changing one's own system (individual or
family) to find meaning and congruence. As a
result, the family accepts the change and incorporates
it into its overall life process. Spirituality
implies connecting with and becoming
a part of other systems, be it other individuals,
organizations, nature, or a higher being, and
thereby finding a new identity and meaning
(Friedemann, 1995).


In the family, these processes of coping
can be observed as behaviors that pertain to
the process dimensions in the inner circle of
the model (Figure 12.3). System maintenance
involves organizational strategies and includes
concepts such as power structure and
problem negotiation patterns (Haley, 1976);
family structure and generational boundaries
(Minuchin, 1974); coalitions, rules, and roles
(Haley, 1976; Lewis, Beavers, Gossett, &amp;
Phillips, 1976); and family organization and
control (Moos &amp; Moos, 1984). Coherence entails
behaviors used to establish and maintain
emotional bonds. Related concepts are closeness
and empathy (Lewis et al., 1976), cohesion
(Moos &amp; Moos, 1984; Olson et al.,
1984), and enmeshment (Minuchin, 1974).
System change behaviors are necessary to adjust
to change from within and the environment.
Concepts such as morphogenesis
(Buckley, 1967), adaptability (Olson et al.,
1984), and family growth and flexibility
(Kantor and Lehr, 1975; Lewis et al., 1976)
address these processes. Individuation consists
of behaviors that individuals employ to
follow their interests and search for meaning.
On the family level, individuation relates to
the family's accommodation to members' differences
in values, opinions, lifestyles, and
schedules. Individuation is implied in concepts
such as self-differentiation (Bowen,
1976), self-disclosure, and expressiveness
(Lewis et al., 1976).


<i>The Nursing Process</i>


The task of categorizing behaviors according
to these process dimensions may be
formidable because the same behavior could
be categorized in more than one process dimension,
depending on the reason why it is
undertaken. For example, a family walk in the
woods could be system maintenance if done
for the sake of physical exercise, coherence if
its purpose is to find togetherness, individuation
if a family member seeks a connection to
nature in his or her search for meaning, or system
change if the walk is to provide a new
identity and reorganization of priorities for the
family. Consequently, nurses need the family's
interpretation of their own behaviors to
reach conclusions. Nursing within the Framework
of Systemic Organization is therefore a
client-driven, holistic, and in-depth approach
to individuals and families. Nurses assess

[p. <i>309</i>]

Friedemann (1995) explains that for a
family to be healthy, all members need to express
a reasonable level of satisfaction with
the family or well-being. To achieve well-being,
each person's developmental needs have
to be honored by the family. Although developmental
needs differ with age, all refer to
growth and change. Friedemann claims that
every crisis in a family occurs when growth is
inhibited, and thus every crisis is a developmental
crisis.


Be it for the sake of crisis resolution or
simply to enhance the life process, the goal of
nursing is not the family's health but the facilitation
of the process the family chooses to
achieve its health (congruence) and allow
each person to grow and develop freely. The
entire process is coping and occurs within the
dimensions of the life process described previously.
The challenge for the nurse is to make
an assessment that represents the family's reality,
not the nurse's.


Friedemann (1995) promotes open discussion
in which the nurse reveals her or his
theoretical thinking by explaining the major
concepts of the model in simple terms and
then encourages the family to explore how everyday
strategies and specific coping attempts
may fit into the four process dimensions. An
agreement about necessary changes is reached
jointly. Strategies to enhance the family process
that lead to a balance of targets that the
family considers optimal are developed by examining
the family's successes in using strategies
in the past. The nurse then assists the
family in using familiar strategies or in the
creation of new ones. Interventions such as
teaching, practicing interactions, or procuring
new resources are used if the family discovers
a need for new strategies. Friedemann has
specified a step-by-step approach in an intervention
model for substance abusing families
(Friedemann, 1989b, 1992). This model also
has been applied in other areas of nursing
(Friedemann, 1995; Friedemann, Jozefowicz,
Schrader, Collins, &amp; Strandberg, 1989).


The Framework of Systemic Organization
is appropriate for families of various cultures,
structures, and/or economic situations.
Whereas the general life process depicted in
Figure 12.3 is generally applicable to all families,
vast differences are found in the specific
strategies used and in the emphasis placed on
certain targets among various types of families.
Within the Framework of Systemic Organization,
culture is defined as two processes
occurring simultaneously—namely, culture
maintenance and culture transformation.
These processes are inherent in the pursuit of
stability versus growth or the maintenance of
cultural tradition versus adaptation of life patterns
to a changed environment. Consequently,
culture is lived within the family life
process. To assess cultural patterns, the nurse
simply follows the dimensions of the life process
and examines how certain strategies are
used to pursue family targets (Friedemann,
1991b, 1995). Because many of these may be
unfamiliar to the nurse, the unbiased use of
the model has the potential for promoting cultural
awareness.


The use of the framework reduces the
comparison of client families along preset
norms that may not be valid for all. Instead of
using norms, the nurse can let the family
judge its own level of health or effectiveness.
He/she may disagree with the family's self-assessment
based on signs of congruence or
stress within the system. In such cases, the
nurse is encouraged to point out inconsistencies
and suggest reevaluation of the situation.
Ultimately, however, it is the family who
makes the decision to change and to make
change happen.


<i>Instrument Development and Use</i>


To use the major concepts of the Framework
of Systemic Organization as a theoretical
basis for research, they need to be
operationalized and measured. Key concepts
are family health and congruence. Friedemann
(1995) states that health can only be estimated

[p. <i>310</i>]

The Assessment of Strategies in Families-Effectiveness
(ASF-E) instrument is
available for initial screening of family health.
The ASF-E (Friedemann, 1991a; Friedemann
&amp; Smith, 1997) represents a subjective assessment
of family effectiveness in all four dimensions.
Respondents mark statements of family
functioning ranked according to levels of effectiveness
that are most like their family. The
latest version has 20 items and subscores for
the targets of stability, growth, spirituality,
and individuation (Friedemann 1998). The
ASF-E has been examined for content, construct,
and concurrent validity (Friedemann,
1991a, 1998). Internal consistency of the
ASF-F is satisfactory, with Cronbach's alpha
coefficients ranging from .69 to .78 for the
subscales and .82 for the total scale. Furthermore,
respondents' scores on the ASF-E have
been found to converge with their descriptions
of family process dimensions specified in the
framework (Friedemann &amp; Smith, 1997). The
ASF-E has also been translated into three foreign
languages and tested in four countries
with families experiencing different life and
health situations. The four targets of the
framework were clearly defined through exploratory
factor analysis in all studies. This
provides substantial evidence of the instrument's
cultural applicability. Because the
evaluation of family effectiveness is subjective,
a high score also implies satisfaction.


In addition to its use in research, the
ASF-E has shown merit as a clinical tool. It
provides a basis for general discussion, the selection
of a focal dimension (scored lower
than the others), and the determination of
needed changes. The tool may also be used to
facilitate discussion about differences in perceptions
among various family members and
to seek a clarification of a desired life process
that satisfies all members. Having defined
such an ideal, the nurse can then work with
the family in determining what coping strategies
to use to arrive at their goal.


The family APGAR (Smilkstein, 1978)
has also been used successfully as a complementary
measure of satisfaction. A variety of
existing standardized anxiety measures and
measures of negative emotions, such as anger
or depression, are recommended to explore
the existence of personal and interpersonal
conflicts that may or may not be family based.


Within the Framework of Systemic Organization,
the family process is also seen as the
major determining factor of outcomes such as
quality of parenting, caregiving, or adjustment
to difficult situations. A tool to measure the
family process at this level needs to delineate
strategies without judging their effectiveness.
Such a tool (ASF-F [Function]) is under development
by Friedemann and others but
needs refinement. Challenges faced in development
of the ASF-F include the need to ensure
cross-cultural relevance of the items and
difficulty related to categorizing each activity
with a specific process dimension.


<i>Research Testing the Framework
of Systematic Organization</i>


Throughout her book, Friedemann (1995)
cites hundreds of studies that provide support
for theoretical tenets of the Framework of
Systemic Organization. In addition, many
studies have been undertaken specifically to
test propositions deduced from the theory.
There are three issues of concern to researchers
working with this and other systemic
frameworks. First, systemic models defy linear
causality, which is the basis of empirical
research. Second, the framework uses a reciprocal
interaction worldview (Fawcett, 1995).
Therefore, the family process is constantly
evolving. This implies that there is no objective
truth of the kind that empirical research
seeks to discover. Finally, the framework of
systemic organization stresses the importance
of understanding diversity, whereas most statistical

[p. <i>311</i>]

Unfortunately, there is no research
method that circumvents these issues. Friedemann
(1995) advocates between-methods triangulation
to group data generated by more
than one method, thereby converging partial
truths. While using innovative approaches, including
qualitative methodology guided by
the framework, close attention to the sampling
procedures, sequencing of the methods, and
interpretation of the data is imperative (Floyd,
1993). A few examples of such research exist.
Pierce (1998) conducted an ethnographic
study of African American families to examine
their experience of caring and the meaning
they found in the process. The Framework
was used as a template along which emerging
themes and behaviors of caregivers were
grouped. The experience of caring involved
eight caring actions pertaining to the four process
dimensions (physical work, sacrifice,
taught and shared actions, structure of caring,
communication, accommodation, mutuality,
and learning). Meaning was described by the
way the caregivers pursued and balanced the
four targets to find congruence. The meaning
of caring encompassed 13 expressions (emotional
burden, evasion of conflicts, motivations
concerned with love and duty, approval
of the care recipient, philosophical introspection,
self-development, fairness, filial ethereal
value, self-contemplation, Christian piety, living
in the moment and hoping for the future,
and purpose). The findings supported the notion
of culture in that patterns were maintained
and transformed within the domains of
caring actions, family functions, and expressions
of caring of these caregivers.


Similarly, Friedemann's study of family
involvement in nursing homes showed that
family functioning measured with the ASF-E
and certain items of the Family Environment
Scale (Moos &amp; Moos, 1984) were the strongest
predictor of families' expectations to be
involved (Friedemann, Montgomery, Rice, &amp;
Farrell, 1999). A qualitative inquiry associated
with the same study complemented these
results by showing that families tried to maintain
their family style even in the nursing
home and desired involvement that was congruent
with the emphasis they placed on the
four family process dimensions. Whereas coherence
was important to most and maintained
through visiting, direct care was related
to an emphasis on system maintenance. Activities
of learning and patient advocacy were related
to families' emphasis on growth and
connecting with their environment (Friedemann,
Montgomery, Maiberger, &amp; Smith,
1997).


Smith and Friedemann (1999) showed
that the framework is well suited to the development
of family process models at the
midrange level in a study involving families
with members who suffered from chronic
pain. Both the ASF-E and in-depth interviews
were used to assess family functioning and the
role that pain plays in the family and in regulating
interactive patterns (Friedemann &amp;
Smith, 1997). The interviews were minimally
structured, and the Framework of Systemic
Organization was used mainly for interpretation
of the results. Dominant themes pointed
to the struggle of the family in finding congruence
—a struggle that was played out by the
individual with pain and on the family level.
The informants with pain reported a great
need to belong and to be heard. In their family
life, this need remained unmet resulting in
distress, loneliness, and confusion. This emotional
climate set the stage for ensuing family
strategies. Several processes were evident. A
cycle of obligations was evident as the individuals
with pain sacrificed themselves for
others, thereby gaining charismatic power and
the ability to bind others through obligation to
serve and reciprocate. A second dynamic was
extreme closeness at the expense of individuation
of the family members and the third was
family isolation from the environment. From
these phenomena, it was evident that healing
as defined by the respondents meant approaching
congruence by breaking the cycle
of obligation and freeing the individual from
the emotional bondage. In support of the
framework, families that reported healing engaged

[p. <i>312</i>]

DeMarco (1997) extended the framework
by applying it to staff teams in acute care hospital
units. Without prior theorizing, focus
groups were used to explore the nature of staff
nurses' interactional behaviors. Results were
used to create items that were organized according
to the four process dimensions of the
Framework of Systemic Organization and
then tested conventionally (DeMarco &amp;
Friedemann, 1995). This approach resulted in
a valid and reliable instrument. In her dissertation,
DeMarco (1997) refined the instrument
and tested a model that she explicated using
the Framework of Systemic Organization in
which relationships between family function
and workgroup function and between family
intimacy and work relationships were hypothesized.
Significant positive correlations were
found between relational patterns in the family
and at work. Silencing the self in the family
was related to keeping silent at work and
being compliant with expected feminine roles
which subsequently led to inner hostility.
These emotions were conceptualized as negative
coherence or lack of individuation.
Nurses who found personal meaning in their
work and incorporated new knowledge experienced
personal growth and demonstrated
positive individual coherence or individuation
at the workplace. DeMarco's findings clearly
speak to the process of seeking congruence or
failing to do so.


<i>Critique and Summary</i>


The approach to nursing practice within
the Framework of Systemic Organization
leads away from a narrow focus on the causes
of distress and methods to deal with the
stressors to a direct intervention with the system
influenced by the stressors in the context
of the entire situation. Likewise, research uses
multiple methods to interpret process as it unfolds.
The approach to practice and research
needs to be family process-specific and, therefore,
sensitive to the families' subjective stress
appraisal. Research and practice methods
must accommodate vast differences in reactions
related to cultural, developmental, and
economic factors that can be assessed only
through open-ended, in-depth interviewing.


Unfortunately, linear approaches to nursing
care that are preferred by nurses for the
sake of simplicity and ease of application are
not congruent with this framework. Thus, any
situation that appears to be easy may become
immensely complex when multiple confounding
factors are added. Nevertheless, Friedemann's
(1995) book provides assessment and
intervention examples so that nurses can learn
to shift their thinking from cause-and-effect
decision making to a more complex systems
approach.


Research studies with the framework
have the potential of revealing novel types of
information, but the danger of getting lost in a
complex maze of mutually interacting forces
exists. Designs need to maintain a fine balance
of simplicity and depth to be useful and
interpretable. Few guidelines currently exist
for the convergence of various research methods,
and the results derived from such methods
and carefully planned designs are greatly
needed. Research with the Framework of Systemic
Organization is still in the experimental
stage, and its quality needs to be carefully
monitored. Nevertheless, this framework
tends to appeal to independent thinkers who
dare to take their research efforts beyond existing
parameters and experiment with new
approaches in the search for new solutions.


<i><b>The Developmental Health Model</b></i>


<i>Origins and Evolution</i>


Another family theory, the Developmental
Health Model (DHM), is a theoretical extension
and refinement of the McGill Model
of Nursing, a curriculum model first developed
by Moyra Allen and faculty at the

[p. <i>313</i>]

At the Nursing Theory Congress in 1986,
Allen presented early theoretical work, which
grounded SRN within an evolving system of
concepts that she called the Developmental
Health Model. Since 1989, Ford-Gilboe and
colleagues at the University of Western Ontario
have been extending Allen's work by
more formally describing theory concepts and
their relationships and by testing hypotheses
derived from the DHM. An explanation of key
theoretical concepts and their relationships
based on a model developed by Ford-Gilboe
(1998) follows (Figure 12.4).


The aim of the DHM is the development
of knowledge about the nature of healthy development
in individuals and families and the
role of the nurse in facilitating this process
(Allen, 1994). An early health-promotion
model, the McGill model, was originally developed
as a means of fully articulating a
complemental role for nursing that was distinct
from that of medicine (Allen, 1977).
Many theoretical influences can be identified.
Families are viewed from a systems perspective
in which the interaction and influence of
individual members, the family unit, and the
broader environment on each other are considered
(Allen, 1983, 1994). Consistent with
the World Health Organization's (1978) view
of health promotion, the DHM emphasizes
process and adopts a strengths perspective
that focuses on how families develop capabilities
needed for healthy living within the context
of everyday life events and the social conditions
within which they live. Social learning
theory (Bandura, 1977) provides a frame of
reference for understanding how families
cope with and learn from life events and how
this learning is transferred from one situation
to another (Allen, 1994). Ford-Gilboe (1998)
contends that the DHM is an "empowerment
model" because its emphasis on strengths,
process, and shared power between the nurse
and family fosters reflection and self-awareness
while building the skills needed to effectively
manage life events and work toward
health goals that are important to the family.
Thus, this approach may be particularly well
suited to families who have been disenfranchised
in some way (e.g., those living in poverty,
single-parent families, and survivors of
abuse).


<i>Key Concepts and
Their Relationships</i>


In the DHM, health is a multidimensional
construct composed of many concepts and
processes (Gottlieb &amp; Rowat, 1987). At least
four characteristics contribute to a family's
overall pattern of health: health work, health
potential, competence in health behavior, and
health status (Ford-Gilboe, 1998). Furthermore,
health is viewed as a characteristic of
the family—a way of living—that is learned
and shaped within the context of family life.
When viewed in this way, it becomes possible
for families to learn how to be healthy as they
experience and deal with life events. These
situations offer opportunities for families to
develop health. Illness is one such situation,
as are other expected and unexpected life
events, such as the birth of a baby, managing
a period of unemployment, or adapting to life
as a single-parent family. Thus, health and
illness are separate concepts in the model
(Allen, 1983, 1994).


Two of the most important attributes of
health are coping and development (Allen,

Relationship of Key Concepts in the Developmental Health Model (DHM) (reproduced from Ford-Gilboe, 1998)</div>
[p. <i>315</i>]

<i>Health Work</i>. Health work, the central concept
in the theory, reflects the process through
which families develop or learn problem-solving
and growth-seeking skills over time.
Health work is a universal process that reflects
essential human qualities—the desire
to learn from and cope with life experiences
aid to develop one's potential. Although families
engage in health work on their own, the
nurse may share this activity when assistance
has been sought to support the family's efforts
for managing a particular situation.


As participation in health work increases,
families become more active in experimenting
with new ways of coping and developing and
make conscious choices to seek healthier
ways of living. Thus, health work may be represented
on a fluid continuum from lower degrees
to higher degrees with many variations
evident between these two extremes. In general,
lower degrees of health work are associated
with lack of interest in or conscious
thought about health matters, a preference for
established health routines over new ideas regardless
of their effectiveness, a focus on
weaknesses or barriers to achieving goals, and
a tendency to base health decisions primarily
on expert opinion or default (doing nothing).
Families who demonstrate lower degrees of
health work engage in limited or inconsistent
problem solving when faced with a challenging
health situation.


In contrast, higher degrees of health work
are reflected by interest and active involvement
in health matters, a focus on family
strengths and abilities, and experimenting
with alternative approaches for promoting
health in collaboration with experts as needed
(Ford-Gilboe, 1997a, 1998). Thus, these families
use a proactive, problem-solving approach
to manage health situations that includes
a constellation of behaviors, such as
observing the situation and gathering information,
examining and analyzing the situation,
generating new and existing alternatives
for managing the situation, selecting options
by weighing the pros and cons and fit with the
family's lifestyle, trying out and evaluating
the plan, and modifying the approach as necessary.


Health work is both situation specific and
general. Because health work develops over
time, families learn to deal with particular situations
using both new and established ways
of coping and developing. As these behaviors
are learned in one situation, they become integrated
into the family's ways of living and
may be translated into new situations that occur.
Thus, when the health work of a family is
examined across different situations, a general
pattern or style emerges.


Furthermore, the degree to which a family
engages in health work is influenced by at
least three factors: the health potential of the
family and its members, the broader context
of family life, and, when present, the way in
which the nurse works with the family (i.e.,
the style of nursing).


<i>Health Potential</i>. Health potential refers to
the strengths, motivation, and resources of
the family and its members (Allen, 1983,
1994; Ford-Gilboe, 1994). Family strengths
are the internal capabilities of the family and
its members that are exhibited as a unique
family functioning style (Ford-Gilboe, 1998).
Qualities of family members, such as personality
dispositions, are also important sources
of family strength. All families, even those
faced with what seem to be insurmountable
challenges, possess strengths (Dunst,
Trivette, &amp; Deal, 1994). Motivation refers to
the family's overall interest in health matters
as reflected by the priority given to health
issues, the family's desire to change health
behavior based on current needs, and family
members' beliefs about their ability to influence
health (Allen, 1994). The motivational
aspect of health potential is closely tied to

[p. <i>316</i>]

Because higher degrees of health work
require active involvement and a view of
health situations as family rather than individual
issues, participating in this process over
time also enhances the health potential of the
family and its members by (a) building new
strengths, (b) cultivating motivation through
the experience of success, and (c) developing
resources of information and support.


<i>Broader Context of Family Life</i>. The broader
social context in which the family is embedded
may affect the extent and pattern of
health work. The nature of this influence is
thought to be situation-dependent. Consistent
with an ecological systems perspective
(Bronfenbrenner, 1977), at least three levels
of the environment can be considered when
describing the context of family life: (a) characteristics
of the family (e.g., cultural background,
stage of the family life cycle, and
family history), (b) characteristics of the immediate
environment (e.g., stressors or
chronic demands imposed by a particular situation,
safety of the neighborhood, and availability
of needed services), and (c) broader
sociopolitical forces that affect family life
(e.g., changes in social programs or policies
and cultural biases or stereotypes that work to
disenfranchise certain groups).


<i>Style of Nursing</i>. The role of nursing in the
DHM is to assist the family to develop
healthy ways of living by structuring experiences
that assist the family to actively engage
in the process of health work. The method of
nursing that accompanies this goal, called situation-responsive
nursing (SRN), is presented
as an alternative to a more traditional,
a priori approach to practice. Key characteristics
of SRN include a view of the family as
client, an orientation to the health aspects of
situations (i.e., how a family copes with situations),
a belief in the need to work with
families over time, development of a collaborative
relationship between nurse and client,
use of an exploratory approach that focuses
on the family members' perceptions of their
situation as information is collected, and a focus
on family potential as opposed to deficits
(Allen, 1994; Gottlieb, 1982; Gottlieb &amp;
Rowat, 1987). This approach contrasts with a
more traditional method of nursing that is
characterized by an individual focus, the
nurse as expert, use of an a priori assessment
framework, episodic care in which interventions
are delivered to the client during a brief
period of time, and a focus on deficits as opposed
to strengths (Allen, 1994).


Allen further emphasizes the importance
of identifying and building on the health potential
of the family by structuring opportunities
for learning new health behaviors that
capitalize on existing family strengths, motivation,
and resources. Thus, the nurse indirectly
fosters health work by assisting the
family to build its health potential. Once developed,
these capabilities can be drawn on to
facilitate health work. Using a SRN approach
is, therefore, theoretically more effective in
assisting families to build health potential and
to engage in health work than the use of more
traditional practice approaches. Over time,
improvements in both health potential and
health work will translate into better health
outcomes (i.e., competence in health behavior
and improved health status) for these families
(Ford-Gilboe, 1998).


Nursing process within the Developmental
Health Model builds on the principles of
collaboration, negotiation, and inquiry. Assessment
is guided by five broad questions
that focus on describing the health situations
with which the family is dealing and
providing some structure for exploration and
dialogue. The goal of assessment is to arrive
at an understanding of how family members
view the situation for which help has been
sought, their goals for managing the situation,
and their current ways of coping, including
their use of resources. As the nurse works

[p. <i>317</i>]

<i>Outcomes of Health Work: Competence in
Health Behavior and Health Status</i>. As families
engage in health work over time, they develop
the skills used as part of the health
work process (i.e., problem solving and goal
attainment), and, as their interest in health
and awareness of health issues increases, they
began to adopt healthier lifestyle practices
(e.g., improved exercise, nutrition, and stress
management). Therefore, competence in
health behavior implies that families are effective
in managing health situations and
achieving health goals and in making and sustaining
lifestyle changes that are important to
them.


The health potential of the family contributes
to the development of competence.
Families who have a well-developed reservoir
of capabilities at their disposal are more likely
to view themselves as competent and to ensure
that their actions are consistent with their
self-perceptions. Over time, increased competence
in health behavior may ultimately result
in improvements in health status. Health status
refers to the functioning of the family and
its members, as indicated by concepts such as
quality of life, satisfaction with family life, or
ability to engage in activities of daily living
(Ford-Gilboe, 1998).


<i><b>Instrument development and Use</b></i>


The Health Options Scale (HOS; Ford-Gilboe,
1997b), a 21-item summated rating
scale, was developed as a measure of Health
Work. This instrument is currently being used
as part of a program of research testing the
DHM. Participants indicate the extent to
which their families engage in behaviors consistent
with health work using a 4-point
Likert-type scale from "strongly disagree" (1)
to "strongly agree" (4). Higher scores reflect
higher degrees of health work. Items representing
both extremes of the health work continuum
are included, necessitating reverse
scoring for some. Items are arranged in three
subscales: (a) Attending, which reflects active
involvement in health matters (8 items); (b)
Goal Attainment, which reflects identification
and pursuit of health goals (6 items); and, (c)
Experimenting, the extent to which the family
uses a problem-solving approach to resolve
health problems (7 items).


Confirmatory factor analysis was used to
assess the dimensional structure of the HOS
using data from a community sample of 325
parents. The proposed three-factor solution
supported the data (GFI = .89) and accounted
for 98% of item variance. Internal consistency
of total and subscale HOS scores has been acceptable
(α &gt; .70). Concurrent validity has

[p. <i>318</i>]

The reliability and validity of the HOS
with children (ages 10-17 years) are currently
being examined using data collected from 200
children in school and community settings. A
clinical version of the HOS has been developed
and is currently being tested by undergraduate
nursing students working with families
in the community.


There is a good fit between many existing
instruments and the theoretical definitions of
health potential, competence in health behavior,
and health status proposed in the Development
Health Model. The following are examples
of instruments that have been used to
measure these constructs:

(Ferrans &amp; Powers, 1985, 1992)


<i><b>Research Testing the
Developmental Health Model</b></i>


The positive impact of situation-responsive
nursing (SRN) has been documented using
a variety of approaches. Both process and
outcomes of SRN have been examined in ambulatory
care units and community nursing
centers (called health workshops) in which the
model was initially demonstrated and evaluated
(Allen, Frasure-Smith, &amp; Gottlieb, 1980;
Frasure-Smith, 1997; Frasure-Smith, Allen, &amp;
Gottlieb, 1997). Across these studies, nurses
who adopted a situation-responsive approach
to practice were found to focus more on helping
clients cope with challenging life situations
and less on treatment of illness. Further-more,
clients reported that these nurses were
more helpful than those who employed more
traditional approaches. The clinical usefulness
of SRN in a variety of clinical settings
has also been described (Carnavale, 1997;
Feeley &amp; Gerez-Lirette, 1992; Grossman,
1997;Meister, 1997; Tyler, 1997). Pless et al.
(1994) compared the effects of a 1-year
health-promoting intervention based on the
principles of SRN to usual care on psychosocial
adjustment of 332 chronically ill children
recruited from hospital speciality clinics.
Analysis of covariance was used to test the
hypothesis that the intervention would be effective
in either reducing or preventing maladjustment,
with baseline scores on several child
outcome measures used as covariates. As hypothesized,
after 1 year, children in the intervention
group were less dependent, less anxious,
and less depressed than those in the
control group.


Concept development and formal testing
of the DHM continue. At the University of
Western Ontario, Canada, the DHM is well integrated
into the undergraduate curriculum,
and lessons learned from using the model in
practice provide vital information necessary
for theory refinement. Much of the theory-testing
and refinement work is being conducted
by faculty and graduate students as
part of the Family Health Promotion Research
Program within the school of nursing. Formal

[p. <i>319</i>]

Although the number of studies testing
propositions derived from the DHM is limited,
findings from these studies provide consistent
support for the theory propositions. A
positive relationship between health potential
and health work has been found in the five
studies in which this relationship was examined.
Many individual and family strengths
have been used to operationalize health potential,
such as resilience, optimism, family hardiness,
family cohesion, and social support.
Furthermore, seven measures of health potential
were found to significantly predict 22% of
the variance in health work in a sample of 138
families with preadolescent children (67 single-parent
families and 68 two-parent families)
(Ford-Gilboe, 1997a, 1997b). Support
for the relationship between health work and
competence in health behavior has been provided
through positive relationships found
between health work and health-promoting
lifestyle practices (four studies) as well as between
health work and both problem-solving
elfectiveness and goal-attainment effectiveness
(one study). The positive influence of
health potential on competence in health behavior
has been supported through
relationships found between mothers' resilience
and healthy lifestyle (Monteith, 1997)
and between many health potential variables
and healthy lifestyle, problem-solving effectiveness,
and goal-attainment effectiveness
(Ford-Gilboe et al., 1999). In two separate
studies, positive relationships were found between
health work and health status measured
using quality of life and family functioning.
Finally, relationships in a causal model that
included the concepts of health potential,
health work, competence in health behavior,
and health status were tested in a sample of
236 single-parent families using structural
equation modeling (Ford-Gilboe et al., 1999).
The model was found to fit the data (GFI =
.987; adjusted GFI = .934), and all specified
paths were moderate and significant (<i>r</i> = .45
to .55, <i>p</i> &lt; .05). Health potential, health work,
and competence in health behavior were
found to predict 30% of the variance in family
functioning.


The consistency of these results with
samples of families who differ in terms of
family form, stage of the lifecycle, and socio-economic
status suggests that the model is applicable
to a wide range of family units. With
the exception of Burrill's (1998) study, samples
have been predominantly English speaking,
with the majority of participants identifying
most closely with Canadian culture and
reporting British or European ancestry. Although
cultural variations in the model are expected,
little research has been conducted in
this area. Findings from Burrill's (1998) study
of Latin American Mennonite families suggest
that the goal attainment aspect of health
work may be less culturally relevant for this
group than for families who have been integrated
into the dominant culture. The issue of
applicability of the theory to families in other
countries, who experience different cultural
and social realities, needs to be studied. Despite
these limitations, the DHM has proven
utility as a guide for clinical practice. As theory
development continues, the Development
Health Model is emerging as a potentially important

<b><i>Discovering Family Stress, Coping, and
Health Experiences Through Qualitative
Research and Atheoretical Approaches</i></b>


<i>The Need for Qualitative Inquiries</i>


Questions about how families experience
and cope with stressful events as well as the
expected and unexpected outcomes of coping
over time could be addressed using qualitative
methods. Qualitative research has the potential
to increase understanding of family behaviors,
motivations, and experiences within a
context of multiple environments of influence.
Qualitative research encompasses an array of
methodological approaches that are bound together
by common purposes and characteristics.
Because qualitative methods are used to
describe experiences from the perspectives of
the family and its members within the context
of their lives, they are ideally suited to discovery
and exploration of family processes and
relationships (Deatrick, Faux, &amp; Moore,
1993; Morse &amp; Field, 1995).


The principal critique of intervention research
through integrated reports or meta-analysis
is that the outcome measures are
gathered from a single-family member as
"reporter" of family functioning (Gillis &amp; Davis,
1993, p. 265; Feetham, 1990; Feetham,
Perkins, &amp; Caroll, 1993). There is further
need to address effective types of interventions
for different types of families and clinical
problems and, most important, which outcomes
can be influenced the most by specific
or combined interventions. Despite these specific
critiques related to methodological concerns,
the most important issue is the need for
a connection between stressor specificity and
the intervention choice. Ogden-Burke, Kauffmann,
Costello, Wiskin, and Harrison (1998)
state that when nurses can identify stressors
with specificity, they can focus on interventions
that can make a difference for families
and individual members.


According to Ogden-Burke and colleagues
(1998), the current theoretical approaches
supporting family stress and coping
relationships and predictions lack a basic
sense of connection with each other. This, in
turn, suggests the need for inductive, qualitative
research to expose the nature, patterns,
beliefs, values, and experiences of stress and
coping to build knowledge in the practice
area. There is a real need to move away from
heavy reliance on theoretically based structured
questionnaires that are lengthy and often
inflexible. Stressors do not occur in a standardized
order, nor do families experience
stressors in the same way. Thus, interventions
can only be inductively discovered based on
exploration of current and unique stress and
coping variables of families and individual
family members.


To understand what is known inductively
about families with a child with a chronic condition,
qualitative studies were reviewed and
then compared to a stress and coping theoretical
framework (Ogden-Burke et al., 1998).
The findings supplied family researchers with
not only a formidable review of many qualitative
studies but also a synthesis of qualitative
findings that strengthens transferability of the
data in relationship to extant theoretical
frameworks.


<i>Qualitative Research Involving Families
With a Child With a Chronic Condition</i>


Qualitative studies that have explored
how families cope with children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) provide good examples of how specific
interventions can be created and implemented
to enhance adaptation and to help
build or validate theory (Kendall, 1998;
Smith, 1998). Kendall found through a
grounded theory approach that parents could

[p. <i>323</i>]

These are two examples of how the open
process dimension of rich, thick data derived
from the family participants supplies researchers
with specific, tangible experiences.
The nature of the actual engagement of researchers
with families can also become a
therapeutic connection with families and specific
family members who have not been able
to tell their stories to others because their stories
did not fit a questionnaire schedule or
their responses became diluted in the controversial
issues regarding scoring of "family"
data (Loveland-Cherry, Horan, Burman,
Youngblut, &amp; Rodgers, 1993).


Other qualitative studies have enlightened
understanding of family experiences of
stress and coping, such as (a) families and
children who were technology-dependent at
home (Allen, Simone, &amp; Wingenbach, 1994;
Petr &amp; Barney, 1993; Young, Creighton, &amp;
Suave, 1988), (b) families with children who
are developmentally disabled or have behavior
problems (Snowdon, Cameron, &amp; Dunham,
1994; Deatrick, Knafl, &amp; Guyer, 1993;
Petr &amp; Barney, 1993; Strauss &amp; Munton,
1985), and (c) families with children experiencing
life-threatening illnesses and uncertainty
in the context of chronic illnesses, such
as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease,
lupus, and scleroderma (Barnes, Bandak, &amp;
Beardslee, 1990; Charmaz, 1990; Cohen,
1993; Gallo &amp; Knafl, 1998; Graves &amp; Hayes,
1996; Knafl, Breitmayer, Gallo, &amp; Zoeller,
1996).


Through survey research, Hentinen and
Kyngas (1998) were able to identify and describe
adaptation of parents with children who
had chronic conditions. Although many family
stress and coping theories have emphasized
the need for health care staff to support
and give parents information about strategic
resources in dealing with crises, the findings
of this study indicate that emotional and instrumental
support are much more important
to parents.


Essentially, the previously mentioned
studies create a map that allows researchers to
understand that parents (a) often feel incapable;
(b) need help dealing with equipment
vendors; (c) need help with insurance companies,
government funding, and travel; (d) have
to deal with others offering help but are not really
being available; (e) have to deal with the
child's fears and developmental changes superimposed
on illness; and (f) have to cope
with other people's attitudes regarding care
for a child at home (Ogden-Burke et al.,
1998).


<i>Other Qualitative Research in
Family Stress and Coping</i>


There is a body of qualitative research
that explores caregiver and patient experiences
as they relate to chronic mental illnesses
(schizophrenia), cognitive changes (Alzheimer's
disease), and the coping patterns and
needs of caregivers described through the
"burden" they experience (Brown, 1993).
Caregiver burden has been studied extensively
for clients who suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's
disease (Chou, 1997; Grassel, 1998;
Gwyther, 1998; Kane, 1997; Vrabec, 1997).
Caregiver burden has been explained as an objective
burden (disruption of family life) and a
subjective burden (e.g., caregiver response to
the situation) (Vrabec, 1997). It is known
that objective burden is reflected by disruptions
in finances, roles, and neighbor relations,

[p. <i>324</i>]

It is unclear whether the experience that
caregivers have in relation to Alzheimer's disease
and dementia is similar to or different
from that of caregivers of clients with other
chronic illnesses. The following is the key
question: How do caregivers experience the
responsibility of caregiving at this point in
time in health care delivery? The experiences
of caregiving with chronically ill populations
are not anecdotal in nature but provide evidence
of strong personal voices that can direct
health policy research and family-based interventions.


<i>Research Priorities</i>


A three-round Delphi study of families
and children in families revealed a need for
qualitative research designs and methods to
explore stress and coping (Broome, Woodring,
&amp; O'Connor-Von, 1996). The highest
levels of consensus for researchable topics on
children with acute illnesses and chronic conditions
included (a) factors that influence
health-seeking behaviors and habits in children,
(b) factors that influence the abilities of
families to balance the demands of chronic illnesses
and the psychological effects of trauma
on children, families, and health care providers,
(c) service needs for families with children
living with HIV/AIDS, (d) effects of
family decision making and child competence
on treatment outcomes, and (e) influences of
family values on use of primary care health
services. Although these research priorities
address the child-family interface specifically,
they also have applicability to other relationships
within aging families (e.g., filial responsibility
with parents) and adult-adult relationships
in general.


Although each of the research priorities is
presented as the "effect" or "influence" of a
factor on a behavior or health outcome, each
can be viewed as a potential research question
about patterns, experiences, values, and attitudes
that are shaped through facets of family
life. Finally, although it is an assumption of
this part of the chapter that research priorities
are universal questions for all people, differences
in race, ethnicity, class, and gender are
formidable reasons to continue to enhance
transferability of findings with and through
different populations of peoples and families
using qualitative family stress and coping research.


- <b>FUTURE
IMPLICATIONS</b>


This chapter has guided the reader through
the development of theory and research with
families and has discussed current approaches
to practicing nursing and designing
nursing research. Certain trends have become
visible with the passage of time.


Historically, the perspectives of stress
and coping theory and research differed significantly
from the systemic perspective of
family systems and family therapy theory and
research. Family stress, first perceived as one
or more stress-inducing events (Holmes and
Rahe, 1967), later became a mutually reinforced
pileup of changes (McCubbin, 1987/
1996) that affected family functioning or family
health (Pearlin, 1991). Even with the introduction
of the concepts of appraisal and style
of coping (Sorensen, 1993), the process of
coping was considered to be linear and to occur
along a timeline. A shift to more systemic
thinking occurred with the new understanding

[p. <i>325</i>]

In nursing, scholars have adopted certain
common views about the family that depart
from the linear perspective. Family health is
conceptualized as a complex process and coping
as overall problem solving. Interventions
are viewed as family driven, with the goal of
empowering families to use their own resources
to become healthy. This has resulted
in a shift in the role of the nurse from the expert
who diagnoses problems to a partner
who can work with the family to mutually explore
family strengths. Finally, the importance
of viewing the family in a broader context of
culture and community life has been reinforced.


Thus, newer trends in nursing include the
notion that the overall family process signifies
coping (Anderson &amp; Thomlinson, 1992;
Friedemann, 1995). Research is seemingly
several steps behind such theory development,
however. Even self-proclaimed systemic researchers
rely on linear models that explore
coping as an independent or dependent variable
or as a mediator because traditional research
has few solutions for the exploration of
systemic, mutually reinforcing processes.
Qualitative methods have gained importance
in family nursing research because they lead
to a broader understanding of people's experience,
motivation, and the meaning ascribed to
certain situations.


It can be anticipated that the previously
mentioned trends will continue into the future.
Nursing at the family system level will provide
many benefits to patients discharged
from hospitals and rehabilitation centers, family
caregivers, parents with young children,
families of the mentally ill, and others. Nevertheless,
such care will remain a luxury rather
than the norm within the United States'
money-driven health care system. Some nurse
practitioners will practice family nursing unofficially
and will seek creative ways to be
reimbursed. Some nursing schools may be inclined
to push family nursing theory into the
background of their advanced nursing curricula,
however, and scientific and medically oriented
course requirements will prevail. This
stands in stark contrast to an urgent need for
effective family interventions as patients are
discharged with more serious health problems
and families are expected to provide more of
their care.


Family stress theory will need to be further
developed in a systematic way so that it
will slowly converge with other types of systemic
family theory. Researchers from various
disciplines need to work together and add
their individual perspectives to complex family
research projects conducted in the context
of different health and illness situations, such
as drug abuse prevention, oncology care, diabetes
maintenance, cardiovascular disease
prevention, and the parenting of chronically
ill children. Family researchers will need to
focus on family processes while they work
with other experts who are knowledgeable
about various health problems and developmental
issues. Together, they will find creative
solutions for symptom maintenance, disease
prevention, health promotion, or rehabilitation.
These interdisciplinary teams also need
to include researchers skilled in a variety of
research methods. Projects that combine
methods, such as those undertaken by Friedemann
and her team (1997), need to be undertaken
more frequently. Most important, such
projects will have to be longitudinal to explore
the ongoing evolution of the family process as
situations change. Such research will not only
focus on commonalties and average performance
but also will describe variations in
family processes based on age, culture, or socioeconomic
status. In fact, studies addressing
distinctions between such groups in terms of
perceptions, motivation for self-care, caregiving
processes, or parenting approaches will
become the center of attention. Much creativity
will be required to render justice to the
complexity and variety of family interactions
and the pursuit of family health.
