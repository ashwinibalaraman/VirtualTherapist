<b>DR:</b> A lot of new stuff.
<b>PT:</b> And then -
<b>DR:</b> Do they have you out looking for night sky?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, not really, we're doing a bunch of math, math in it, it's really not that fun.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Well, there are some nice, you could see some planets last night.  You ought to go out there -
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> And look.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Did you see them?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Which, what planets?
<b>PT:</b> Venus and Jupiter I think.
<b>DR:</b> I think so.  I couldn't decide if the one was Mars or Venus, probably Venus.
<b>PT:</b> We, we said, we said, we were talking about it in class today.
<b>DR:</b> And that's what he said?  Venus and Jupiter?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I don't know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> They were pretty bright up by the moon, aren't they?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, they were.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> See, you're appreciating astronomy already.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [LAUGHING].  Right.  Um, but I'm trying to do the math, that's hard.  Everything else I've got, I've got a C in English too -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And everything else As and Bs.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm very happy.
<b>DR:</b> You studying much?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Do you?
<b>PT:</b> I mean I study occasionally, but I don't study as much as I should, but [INAUDIBLE] if I made a C without study then obviously -
<b>DR:</b> Obviously what?
<b>PT:</b> If I studied, I'd make an A, but now I do study my astronomy mainly.  I'm writing down notes everyday in class when everybody is sleeping in class, I'm writing notes and I'm learning in class -
<b>DR:</b> Are you?
<b>PT:</b> I take from what I've learned in class back to the next day.
<b>DR:</b> Do you learn when you take notes?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's how I learn.  That's how I've done things all year like whatever the teacher tells me, I write it down and to look at it and to write it down is a big help to me.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause it's like memory.  It's like sticking in my memory.
<b>DR:</b> And how's your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, sir.
<b>DR:</b> No problems?  Side effects or otherwise?
<b>PT:</b> No, sir.
<b>DR:</b> You take them regularly everyday?  Pay attention in class and listening and -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I find it fun now.  It's weird.
<b>DR:</b> You -
<b>PT:</b> It's like I'm so bored I'm like it's fun.
<b>DR:</b> You like to learn things?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.  Yeah, I might as well do something.
<b>DR:</b> As long as you're there, you might as well just learn.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Don't waste, don't waste your time, right?
<b>PT:</b> I guess so.
<b>DR:</b> Now the Zoloft, you're on 1.5, is that right?  And the Adderall is morning and afternoon?
<b>CG:</b> Right.  'Cause she's taking 1 of those in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Not 2 a day?  Just 1?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What time does it wear off?
<b>PT:</b> Around, probably at the end of the day.  I mean, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Makes, doesn't make homework too tough for you?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.  Well, my senior year, we don't really have that many, much homework.  We have like, like a worksheet and we'll do it in class instead of doing it at home, you know what I mean?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Like you're more doing it in class than you are -
<b>DR:</b> You don't have, uh, projects or -
<b>PT:</b> No sir, not yet.  But we're, we should be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No senior project?
<b>PT:</b> No, sir.  I think in astronomy we're going to make our own planet or planet or an alienation.  We're going to make like an atmosphere.  I mean not an atmosphere but another, what is that called?  Galaxy.
<b>CG:</b> Hmm.
<b>DR:</b> You're going to make a galaxy, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You're pretty powerful to make a galaxy, huh?  Make planets.  [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> So you and your boyfriend are okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is he treating you like a princess?
<b>PT:</b> Yes sir.  He, um, he got a puppy yesterday.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, now, you're in love.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> For sure.
<b>PT:</b> He got a Black Lab named Dixie.
<b>DR:</b> You girls and puppies.  They tell me, I have four boys and I tell them if you ever want to attract girls, take, get a puppy and go sit at the park.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> That's right.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> A baby or a puppy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I don't like babies.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> No, but you would be, you'd be over there checking it out.
<b>PT:</b> You know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> So whose dog is it?  His dog or -
<b>PT:</b> It's both of ours.
<b>DR:</b> Is it yours and his?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> He told me I could keep it for now, when it gets older 'cause he has a bunch of other dogs -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What's your mom think of that?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You guys having a joint dog?
<b>CG:</b> Well, as long as I don't have to feed it.
<b>PT:</b> I'll feed it.  I'll pay for it.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So you, how long have you guys been together now?
<b>PT:</b> For a year and eight months, eight months now.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Serious, huh?  You think he's the one, huh?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know yet.
<b>DR:</b> That's good.  I'm glad you don't know.  You don't need to know.
<b>PT:</b> I don't want to -
<b>DR:</b> What's he doing next year?
<b>PT:</b> Um, he's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  And what are you going to do next year?
<b>PT:</b> Go to college.
<b>DR:</b> Where?
<b>PT:</b> I'm thinking about like going to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then transferring somewhere.
<b>DR:</b> Stay at home for two years?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're not applying anywhere are you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I applied to [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] here?
<b>CG:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] -
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] a couple more pieces of paper.
<b>DR:</b> How far's that from home?
<b>PT:</b> Um, not too far.  I mean if I went to [DEIDENTIFIED], I probably would stay with my grandma.  She lives like right down the road from it.  Well, not right down the road [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [INAUDIBLE] down to [DEIDENTIFIED].  We're kind of about halfway.
<b>DR:</b> And [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Where's [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Or what are you talking about?  Where's, where's [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it's in the middle of the state.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> I've got to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> So [DEIDENTIFIED] probably be your best bet?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What's your mom thinking about you living with your grandma and not with her?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> Probably [INAUDIBLE] but then I can take care of her.
<b>DR:</b> Take care of -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Doesn't she take care of herself?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, she does, but she's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Who's going to take care of you?
<b>PT:</b> Myself.  I'll be old enough.
<b>DR:</b> You think so?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's a lot of responsibility.  Get yourself fed, get yourself to school, study on your own, nobody to check up on you, nobody to bug you.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Does that make you nervous?
<b>PT:</b> A little.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Is, now [DEIDENTIFIED] I've never seen, been to that campus.  Is there a lot of very nice -
<b>PT:</b> It's, it's pretty.
<b>DR:</b> Is it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've seen it like I've been, I [INAUDIBLE].  It's pretty nice.
<b>DR:</b> Where's it at in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>CG:</b> Right off the bypass [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Is that a growing campus, you think?  Is it, uh -
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  That's [INAUDIBLE].  They said, um, in the next two years maybe, it's going to go to a four-year college instead of two.
<b>DR:</b> You'd probably be better going there if you're going to go to a four-year school rather than tech.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  But I'm kind of shooting for tech 'cause I really think that I need to have some like I want to get used to college and then [INAUDIBLE] college.
<b>DR:</b> Well, [DEIDENTIFIED]'s not big.
<b>PT:</b> I know, but it's growing.
<b>DR:</b> Hum?
<b>PT:</b> It's growing.  So [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You should go talk to them -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And see what they, what it's like there 'cause [DEIDENTIFIED]'s is pretty big.
<b>PT:</b> Is it?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is.
<b>DR:</b> It's pretty big.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, it is.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  It has a lot of students 'cause [DEIDENTIFIED] may not have quite as many and I know that some of the [DEIDENTIFIED] branches that I have been to, the people there just seem real proactive and helpful with their students.
<b>PT:</b> I went to the [INAUDIBLE], but I don't know how [INAUDIBLE].  I mean I saw the classrooms and everything [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you wouldn't commute there.
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> That's what I was kind of thinking.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE], but there I'm [INAUDIBLE].  Well, I'd really like to [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> They had huge screens -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> They treat it like a movie really.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you ought to go see [DEIDENTIFIED].  Do you have a preference where you want her to go?
<b>CG:</b> Hum-um.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> If you go to tech, make sure you take classes that can transfer.  Sometimes kids end up taking classes that can transfer.  Whereas at [DEIDENTIFIED] they'd pretty much be assured, because it's part of the same system.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> It's exciting for you.  You don't think about it too much though, do you?
<b>PT:</b> I mean I'm trying to think about it, but it's just like I don't know.  Like I don't know.  They get, I, I'm just glad to be [INAUDIBLE] but I honestly don't know where I want to go.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know you don't want to spend another year in high school.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>CG:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I know that [INAUDIBLE].  I want to go to like, hmm -
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED] would be okay and if it doesn't work out living with grandma, you could live at home.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Right, 'cause if you went to tech, you'd live at home, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So you kind of think it'd be better if you stayed with your grandma?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.  I'm not sure.
<b>DR:</b> Have you ever stayed with her for any length of time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  How was that?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it was pretty good.  It was good.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you're going to be gone most of the day.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> You working?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm catering right now.
<b>DR:</b> How's that going?
<b>PT:</b> It's fine.  I'm, I've been catering on Wednesdays.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So I'm -
<b>DR:</b> They pay you something?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I get, I get pretty good money.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  What are you doing with it?
<b>PT:</b> Well, using it for gas and spending [INAUDIBLE] 'cause I have one check coming in from Wednesday and I have another check coming in from Saturday after I get [INAUDIBLE].  I'm going to be wore out.
<b>DR:</b> Your attitude's been pretty good?  Your worries aren't too bad, huh?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You worry about your boyfriend much?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Not too jealous?  Is he?
<b>PT:</b> He can be.  Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, because you're around all those cute boys at school?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and he needs to be [INAUDIBLE].  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> Is that what you tell him?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Is he going to adult ed?
<b>PT:</b> No, he's in the process of trying to find somewhere to go and [INAUDIBLE].  He doesn't know how like, he doesn't know if he's going to be [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Is he not too organized?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's organized.  He's smart, he is.  He knows, I mean he can do stuff like [INAUDIBLE] in order for him to get a good job.
<b>DR:</b> Where's he work now?
<b>PT:</b> Well, his dad's trying to find him a job within his company [INAUDIBLE].  They make a lot, [INAUDIBLE] dollars an hour.
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't work now?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> What's he do all day?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].  I don't know.  [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> That'd be boring.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  That's, he can't [INAUDIBLE] and he won't do jobs [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> You do?  You're going to take him to work then too?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Make sure he gets there and does a good job and -
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> And what is, when does his responsibility come into this?
<b>PT:</b> I know.  I know.
<b>DR:</b> I don't think you can, uh, make people do that -
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Like that.  He's going to have to motivate himself.
<b>PT:</b> I mean he's motivated.  He just, um, sometimes he doesn't [INAUDIBLE] with things.
<b>DR:</b> You sound discouraged with him.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I want him to get a good job because I know he can do [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Eating good?  Energy's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Not too tired?
<b>PT:</b> I have PE every morning.
<b>DR:</b> Do you?
<b>PT:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Everyday?
<b>PT:</b> We go in the weight room and we work out a lot and we have football coaches [INAUDIBLE].  He's like, he used to be like, he's the football coach there.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Anyways, he makes us like, he makes girls like put like weights on [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> And they start off with like a five-pound weight.  Crazy.  [INAUDIBLE] and doing benches, I was like -
<b>DR:</b> So this is just one semester, I guess?
<b>PT:</b> No, this is all the year.
<b>DR:</b> Really?  Everyday?  Wow.
<b>PT:</b> Everyday in the morning.
<b>DR:</b> Keep you guys in shape, huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do any of your classes change in January?
<b>PT:</b> Um, one class changes.  My government class changes and economics class.

<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Not a lot of A's in there, are there?
<b>PT:</b> Not a lot.
<b>DR:</b> Not everybody will pass it.
<b>PT:</b> Well, it's kind of easy this year.  I mean I don't know.  Like we all help each other out [INAUDIBLE] but not cheating, but we'll all get together and study or we'll tell each other when to have our papers due.
<b>DR:</b> Are you pretty organized with things like that with your papers and getting them done -
<b>PT:</b> I do.
<b>DR:</b> On a timely bases?
<b>PT:</b> I feel really organized this year.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  So you know where things are and -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I just, I got tired of being unorganized all through the years and stuff and I had to go get new binders and stuff like that.  So I just thought [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What was it so bad being unorganized?
<b>PT:</b> Um, just 'cause, uh, because I would throw stuff down and not think about where to put it in the binder.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, so what?  What's so bad about that?
<b>PT:</b> I mean I can't find it.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, you waste time trying to find stuff?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But then when it shows up you can be surprised.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Wow, I didn't know I had that.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING].  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>DR:</b> [LAUGHING].  What you're doing is a lot smarter, of course.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> And I like, I take time to like, even like on my breaks and stuff, like break's not that big of a deal now, like I'm not going to hang out with my friends anymore, I just like sit there and like put my binders and stuff, put all my stuff [INAUDIBLE].  I don't [INAUDIBLE].

<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> She doesn't give you too hard a time?
<b>CG:</b> Hum-um.  No, she's pretty good.  I can't complain.
<b>DR:</b> You're very fortunate to have a, uh, kind of a laidback, understanding mom, you know that, don't you?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, don't worry.  I was thinking about that today.
<b>DR:</b> Were you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because everybody told me they got their phone taken away because they got in trouble for something on Friday.  Well, I mean it wouldn't, probably wouldn't matter to me because I know how to use it.
<b>CG:</b> [LAUGHING].

<b>PT:</b> Probably not -
