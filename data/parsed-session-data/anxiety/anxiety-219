COUNSELOR: 185... 34-130. Interview one. Interview one. Robinson counselor. Interview one. Robinson counselor. (inaudible at 0:00:17.0).
COUNSELOR: First (ph) let me just say that... We're only allowed to do (ph) twenty sessions together. And, it really-you've been... They're really (inaudible at 0:00:33.2) a means to talk about things that really most concern you, that are really most relevant to (inaudible at 0:00:38.0). 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I'm really-I find it really healthy though, to (inaudible at 0:00:53.8).
CLIENT: I don't know where to begin. I'd never... had gone to a counselor center.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:06.1)
CLIENT: Right! So this is my first crack at it. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:11.5)
CLIENT: And I (inaudible at 0:01:13.4) with them. Even that's-what I do, I'm a grad student. (inaudible at 0:01:18.5)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:01:18.5)
CLIENT: Although.. well the reason that I really (inaudible at 0:01:30.6) is that I'm realizing to myself, that I come expecting that I have problem, to seek help. And I thought, "No. That's illogical for me to do." And I asked around and I got the main (ph) number of this place. And the reason that I am here is because I have a problem, as far as sex is concerned. And, I find myself leaning more towards homosexual than heterosexual. And, I don't want to be, you know [all that stuff] (ph). But time and again, I've never ever really had a heterosexual relationship. So I really couldn't say if I'd like that either. So.
COUNSELOR: And it might be you don't really have any experience (inaudible at 0:02:26.4). 
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: Not exactly-(inaudible at 0:02:28.6) you've seen if you like it or not. 
CLIENT: Right yeah right.
COUNSELOR: But I guess-you know I couldn't live with (inaudible at 0:02:34.9). Kind of feel attractions towards those men, and it kind of bothers you. 
CLIENT: Yeah right. So... and again, I've been (ph) with men and I never really experienced... never had a sex act with a woman. And, I think I'm kind of afraid of it. 
COUNSELOR: What-(inaudible at 0:03:01.3) you can tell me -  what do you explain to me you didn't like the men, how that is (ph). (inaudible at 0:03:10.1) 
CLIENT: Yeah, you know. More or less. Believe me, it's nothing else. It felt more-an incredible (inaudible at 0:03:24.8) or anything else. (inaudible at 0:03:27.4). 
COUNSELOR: Kind of (inaudible at 0:03:28.2).
CLIENT: Yeah right. Yeah. It was. And I haven't been able to-approach it as far as a woman is concerned. 
COUNSELOR: Can you say more about (inaudible at 0:03:40.3).
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know... why. Because I'm that type of a person. I'm not the person who would-I'm not the type of person who takes the initiative. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like... when you say you're not the type of person who takes the initiative, that keeps you away from women? Or, that... 
CLIENT: Yeah. It does. Yeah. That would keep me away from-it would keep me from more or less approaching a woman. Yeah. (inaudible at 0:04:30.1) Kind of a feeling. When I-whenever (ph) I end up with a woman and we're having a sexual relationship. It really didn't mean that, okay this is it. Well, one thing that (inaudible at 0:04:54.8). It's been like, you just-don't had sex with them, because it's not like you're married. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:05:05.5)
CLIENT: Yeah that is (inaudible at 0:05:07.1) You know nothing is really (inaudible at 0:05:10.3). 
COUNSELOR: Right. Yeah, sure. Like I guess the concern is that you're (inaudible at 0:05:20.6). Just being that there hasn't been any, but yes there's also kind of a feeling that-
CLIENT: Yeah. There really hasn't any... real opportunity you know, like, come about. I don't know I would react, to tell you truthfully. I really don't have any idea. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like-say you'd been in a situation where there was an opportunity. You don't know if you'd really want it or-
CLIENT: Yeah I think - I did. But again I don't know how I-how the whole thing would come about. Turn out, how the whole thing would turn out. I really have no idea. 
COUNSELOR: Well when you say you have no idea, you can't (inaudible at 0:06:05.6).
CLIENT: I don't think so. 
COUNSELOR: What can you-like what can you see happening. What do you imagine might happen. 
CLIENT: The thing is that-if I had had a sexual relationship with a woman, it wouldn't be like-I wouldn't like to have any commitment toward this woman as far as the relationship is concerned. So if I had a sexual relationship with a woman I'd just like to be able to (inaudible at 0:06:44.6). And just walk away and forget the whole thing. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, you'd like to have the experience without anything-
CLIENT: Yeah right. That's what-you know. Yeah right. You got it. That's about it. 
COUNSELOR: I guess I still-I'm a little confused. I still don't know if you feel kind of like you're afraid of something. 
CLIENT: I-I'm - the way that I have been brought up, and I was brought up in a Catholic school and parochial school. And you always respect a woman. You don't ever touch a woman or anything like this. You know this is (inaudible at 0:07:40.4). It's just something that isn't done. And, you know this is what had been pounded into my head. (inaudible at 0:07:50.7) You always respect a lady (inaudible at 0:07:57.6). 
COUNSELOR: And having sex with a lady is not respecting her, is that what you mean. 
CLIENT: Yeah, more or less. But it was like you just don't, unless of course you're married. By that time, who knows what may come about.
COUNSELOR: Sounds like you've been really cutting to the roots for it, for why you're [kind of feeling]. 
CLIENT: Yeah I think that why-definitely why I'd be afraid of a -
COUNSELOR: Yeah I can sure see, it's kind of hard to feel like-it's kind of an attitude (inaudible at 0:08:37.0). You respect... and you kind of really (inaudible at 0:08:41.3) not feeling positively toward sex towards women. But I still kind of get a sense of what that feeling is about, or whether it feels (ph). I know that's kind of hard to do. 
CLIENT: Well you know like-(inaudible at 0:09:01.2). So like a person-if you had been a virgin. And you find that most people are wilder (inaudible at 0:09:12.9). For you it's more when you're drinking. And if you're not-I probably don't. A hell of a lot more comfortable here, drunk, something I don't know. High or something. And this is probably-you know this is probably you know, what it's like. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you'd feel (ph) if you're drunk. 
CLIENT: Yeah right. 
COUNSELOR: You'd feel the same sort of nervousness when you're drunk. You feel kind of locked- like somehow (inaudible at 0:09:41.1)
(crosstalk)
CLIENT: Right. You just don't-you don't feel-really drunk but just kind of drunk. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah. You feel very very (inaudible at 0:09:53.8). 
CLIENT: Yeah. That's (inaudible at 0:09:57.6). It's not a very comfortable feeling. I should get drunk more often. I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: I can really tell a sense of there being nervousness right now. (inaudible at 0:10:14.7)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:10:18.6)
COUNSELOR: Would you like to talk about it?
CLIENT: My nervousness? 
COUNSELOR: Like if there are things-things that (inaudible at 0:10:28.5) that seem pretty relevant to you. 
CLIENT: Yeah. I've actually done some though and experienced something. It's not a nervousness anymore. It's just kind of a first crack at it, like I needing help (ph). Besides I'm really kind of... more or less a-you're not really-
COUNSELOR: Kind of a (inaudible at 0:10:48.6).
CLIENT: Yeah you're relaxed (ph)! Yeah they used to have these-the first time in anything that I found myself I would be nervous. The first time in anything. I... (inaudible at 0:11:06.7). Stuff like that. I found myself getting better-(inaudible at 0:11:10.6). It really didn't bother me. I really wasn't apprehensive-like I was before. I (inaudible at 0:11:18.6) and stuff like. I could barely open up my mouth. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you know being-you were nervous maybe in World History. 
CLIENT: I don't know. Maybe it's because you're afraid of failure. Because whatever you do you're afraid you're going to do... more or less shot down. 
COUNSELOR: You kind of feel like-like on the spot or it feels like you're-like this is (inaudible at 0:11:42.3) or something? 
CLIENT: Not-sometimes that's how I feel. Maybe-like this thing here, I probably-maybe-the more experience and my knowledge more or less is at the bottom of my experiences. And maybe the... (inaudible at 0:12:11.3). I'd rather feel like... (inaudible at 0:12:16.1). 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:12:20.0)
CLIENT: Yeah right. "Let's just do the same old stuff." 
COUNSELOR: This concept about... failure. Does that-does that have anything to do with you [being sure] about sex with women? 
CLIENT: No I don't think so. I really don't. Because you know-there, in that type of (inaudible 0:12:45.0) situation would arise, I would be apprehensive about, more or less, even going with the situation. And it wouldn't be a sense of failure. Not until I realized that I had failed, if I couldn't fail.
COUNSELOR: It's like that kind of looks-something negative in this decision. 
CLIENT: Yeah. That's it. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like the situation itself would seem so nervous. 
CLIENT: Yeah. That's it. (nervous laugh)
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like-sleeping with a woman, having sex with a woman, [is a really tough thing]. That's incredibly... potential (inaudible at 0:13:21.6). Like the situation might be just, incredibly (inaudible at 0:13:26.0). 
CLIENT: The problem is finding a woman. I mean you know like I said, I don't think that I know-I'd be very apprehensive about having sex, now, with a woman who I'm very familiar with, with no commitment at all. But with someone else I think it would be very much, less, apprehensive or something? 
COUNSELOR: Less but still apprehensive.
CLIENT: Yeah. See, the woman-she'd would have to name, set the game. (inaudible at 0:14:08.5)
COUNSELOR: Kind of like you (inaudible at 0:14:12.0). 
CLIENT: Uh-uh. No. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: What kind of laugh (ph) is that. Is that about nervousness or you don't know what to do?
CLIENT: Maybe that's it. Maybe nervousness and not knowing what to do. (laughs) I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Because you're (inaudible at 0:14:30.7) or feeling like you really really have to be pulled in today,.
CLIENT: Not pulled in... you know. Yeah I just do that. But other wise, it's good enough to a (inaudible at 0:14:46.5). And, I don't know maybe I don't have that much respect for it, getting back to the idea of respecting all women. Maybe that's a woman who I didn't have that much respect for. I really didn't feel like I'm doing anything dirty. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like-you can't quite see yourself, having sex with (inaudible at 0:15:11.0). 
CLIENT: Right, right. 
COUNSELOR: And how do you feel-how do you feel about things that (inaudible at 0:15:32.3) with men. (inaudible at 0:15:37.5) have you felt bad about those or? 
CLIENT: Yeah you know like, afterwards, there are guilt complexes and things like that. But (inaudible at 0:15:50.9). Not at the time. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:15:56.5) I kind of sensed (inaudible at 0:15:58.4) this doesn't feel right to you. 
CLIENT: No, no. Yeah right. I try to stifle it. And-
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:16:12.2)
CLIENT: Right. From the sex and toward, sex within myself, I try to stifle it. 
COUNSELOR: Try to stop you from-
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Sexual feelings for homosexual men. 
CLIENT: And you know more or less, yeah. And (inaudible at 0:16:30.5) in wars and things like that. All sorts of stuff. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, you're really trying-
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: Cut that out of me, it's kind of whenever (inaudible at 0:16:41.7). 
CLIENT: Yeah but it's-kind of hard. (laughs) Silence. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Silence makes you nervous?
CLIENT: Yeah it does. Yeah it makes me nervous. Except for after the game (ph). 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:12.8)
CLIENT: Pardon me?
COUNSELOR: I'm not sure I know what you mean. 
CLIENT: Oh well I mean-I teach school. On Friday afternoons it's always (inaudible at 0:17:18.7). so that's why, after I haven't experienced silence for all afternoon. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: It's like an experience where you can really be your own-
CLIENT: Uh-huh. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:17:31.4) be even more nervous inside. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Right. (laughs) I never did understand it. You know. With someone. I can experience silence by myself, and just kind of relax and fall out. But with someone it's kind of nervous. I tend to fill in silence with someone else sitting right. I feel like, "Wow, I better say something." 
COUNSELOR: I wasn't sure I understand. Kind of like you feel like the pressure to conform (ph) to the silence. 
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: Makes you feel very nervous inside. Does talking about that make you more nervous or?
CLIENT: Talking? Yeah, it doesn't make me more nervous. But, I don't know what to say. And that makes me nervous. And I don't know-if I don't have anything to say, then I get nervous. (inaudible at 0:18:46.6)
COUNSELOR: I think you think I'd like you to say more about your feelings about sexuality. But I don't want to pressure you into doing it. It feels really comfortable to me. Do you see what I mean? This could be kind of a place, you want to- you're feeling like, that's still something very important to me, but I kind of sense it. (inaudible at 0:19:17.6) 
CLIENT: Yeah, that's true. If you'd ask me a question I'd answer it. (inaudible at 0:19:25.2)
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's the thing. What I'm trying to do, in [just a few hours] (ph). Yeah, sounds like it (inaudible at 0:19:33.6). 
CLIENT: Yeah that's true. But I mean it doesn't do me a whole lot of good just to talk about them. 
COUNSELOR: To talk about...?
CLIENT: Yeah, I could-I could go to the confessional, and talk there. I don't know. It's just one of those things. I've done that before, too. Didn't do me a whole lot of good either. 
COUNSELOR: I guess kind of what kind of difference would (inaudible at 0:20:13.2). 
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah right. I don't even know, as far as a psychiatrist's role is supposed to be. 
COUNSELOR: Pardon?
CLIENT: What your role is supposed to be. 
COUNSELOR: My role?
CLIENT: Yeah. What you're supposed to do. 
COUNSELOR: It varies from different people to different people. And what I really want to try to do here, really try to understand what you're saying, what your experiences are, and what it feels to you. Kind of, take the (inaudible at 0:20:54.7). Do you think your feelings kind of help you to focus on what they are, and breath more deeply [in a way] (ph)?
CLIENT: I said it all to myself, many many many times. 
COUNSELOR: See, the problem, I think sometimes when young (ph) people say things to themselves is, it gets lost. You don't know where to go from there. Sometimes if someone, says something back to you, helps you focus it more (inaudible at 0:21:24.5) inside your own head. 
CLIENT: And so, ultimately I would just go further. And wouldn't I going further solve the problem? 
COUNSELOR: It often does. (inaudible at 0:21:43.3)
CLIENT: I don't see how it's separate. 
COUNSELOR: How do you feel... do you feel like your problem is kind of unsolvable? Like really tucked away (inaudible at 0:21:58.7) sexuality?
CLIENT: God I hope not. No. If I did I wouldn't be here, that's it. No, that's why-well-I just hope not. Maybe I'll be able to answer your question after we're all through. If it is unsolvable, we'll know. I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of-I really sense that you just feel kind of frustrated by (inaudible at 0:22:28.9).
CLIENT: Yeah. Frustrated. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like (inaudible at). 
CLIENT: Yeah, at least the way it could be. As far as I-I'd like to get married and all this stuff. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. And I'd like to share feelings with someone and do things and all that sort of stuff. Of course sometimes, I'd like to be alone too. 
COUNSELOR: You kind of like being alone, but it's kind of an (inaudible at 0:23:01.1). You like times with both. And when (inaudible at 0:23:05.6) you want a whole lot to do (ph). 
CLIENT: No I don't want a whole lot-you know like when... everything's contained, if I want something, if I want it to be there. 
COUNSELOR: You kind of really, would like that. Get married, find someone you liked but - 
CLIENT: Yeah. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: It's hard to see that as a possibility but-
CLIENT: Right. I don't want to keep anybody out. The whole thing.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:23:33.7)
CLIENT: Say for instance if I did get married. And then you know, I did get married. And I had found out that I really feel - that I'm gay. I don't have a sexual identity. And it'd be-I don't want to cheat anybody out. (inaudible at 0:23:52.5) That's why. That's why I'd be apprehensive about getting married. And knowing whether I enjoy it. 
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you feel a... desperateness (inaudible at 0:24:12.8). 
CLIENT: Right. That's the whole thing. Maybe when I have - - when I run up with this woman, who isn't-doesn't have any commitment, it'll solve my problem. 
COUNSELOR: It kind of make it seems like an experience will solve the problem. 
CLIENT: I don't know. I said maybe. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Well what keeps you from (inaudible at 0:24:38.3). 
CLIENT: I don't know how to say I'm (inaudible at 0:24:40.4). 
COUNSELOR: Well what is it-how do you go about it with men.
CLIENT: I - they just-you-they just, you meet a man. I can meet him in a john or anywhere. They're always willing to take the initiative, that's all. But like I said, a woman won't. Or doesn't. Or I haven't run up with any, that do, more or less, if you want to call them a prostitute or a whore or whatever. But I haven't run up with. One-well-I know a girl who-we had been to bed together and all that stuff. I'd never been real nervous or anything. And then I said, "Okay" and she said, "No." And that just blew that [whole thing] (ph). 
COUNSELOR: Tell me some more about that. You'd been to bed together (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah we had been -  we were in bed together and making love and all this stuff. And you're ready to experience intercourse and she said, "No." 
COUNSELOR: How did-how did that bring a surprise to you?
CLIENT: You know shot me right down. I said, "Okay. Goodbye." 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like her rejecting and not wanting you. 
CLIENT: Yeah right! It's like, "Well why'd you go this far?" That was the whole thing. Well what, you know, why? 
COUNSELOR: You really-that's (inaudible at 0:25:54.7). 
CLIENT: Yeah right. That was like-that was it, then and there. I was like, "Okay, goodbye." You know that was it. 
COUNSELOR: Was that a recent thing or?
CLIENT: No, about... two years back. 
COUNSELOR: How did you-how did it feel to you, when you were lying around-
CLIENT: Oh it was nice. I enjoyed it. I really did. I was aroused and everything else. And it was nice. 
COUNSELOR: So it was kind of not like-a woman doesn't attract you. 
CLIENT: Oh no. No, it's not that. 
COUNSELOR: Do you find women attractive? 
CLIENT: Most women. 
COUNSELOR: I see so it's kind of like-you do kind of get the sense that it would be enjoyable. 
CLIENT: Oh yeah. I do, yeah.
COUNSELOR: You were really enjoying with this one, and she stopped you-
CLIENT: That was it. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:26:52.1) But I get the sense that sometimes ultimately (inaudible at 0:26:56.5). 
CLIENT: Oh! It was more-she again was that type of a woman. Who more or less said, "Okay, let's-we can go to bed together." I said, "Fine." And then we went to bed together. And then-she just said, "No." And then I said to myself, "What were you trying to prove?" And I knew her-I knew her quite well. But... I knew her quite well but I also knew that-she sleeps with other men and all this stuff. So I wasn't like-I wasn't going to be the first or anything as far as that was concerned. So I wasn't going to have even have that commitment or anything else like that. One of those-cheats (ph), I don't know. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah it's kind of like (inaudible at 0:27:50.4). 
CLIENT: Yeah it did. Yeah it did. But still-I saw her after that, and I still talk to her once in a while and stuff like that. It isn't like I don't talk to her or anything like that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that's where was kind of important element in all of this. It's kind of like, who you are to her, in bed. Yeah, being sexual with a woman, and never likes that to stop. Do you feel kind of like-kind of taken like you are doing something wrong? Or did it feel good? 
CLIENT: Oh... she had me (inaudible at 0:28:33.3). She couldn't take this and all this stuff. And she (inaudible at 0:28:37.5) birth control pills and all confused and concerned that she might become pregnant, all be all (inaudible at 0:28:44.6). 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:28:46.9). 
CLIENT: And I, like I said, I felt that, "Well, if you had known this before, then why did you even start?" As far as this was concerned. 
COUNSELOR: But did you take it as some kind of like, (inaudible at 0:29:03.9) of you? 
CLIENT: No. No I didn't. Actually she was enjoying herself too. I think she was. She sure acted like it -  yeah right. She told me it wasn't that (ph). 
COUNSELOR: You kind of like when girls maybe take the initiative and you sound like you do really enjoy (inaudible at 0:29:28.3) with women. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Right. That was it. 
COUNSELOR: But it's kind of like, you're having to (inaudible at 0:29:34.0). 
CLIENT: No, no. 
COUNSELOR: Why, because women haven't taken the initiative? 
CLIENT: Yep. 
COUNSELOR: Well I guess now I'm kind of just wondering what (inaudible at 0:29:46.2) to move on. 
CLIENT: And why I don't take the initiative. (laughs) That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's because, like I said, the way that I was brought up. "You'd better take the initiative." 
COUNSELOR: Sure. I guess kind of like you just feel like (inaudible at 0:30:07.1).
CLIENT: Mm-hm. I know. At this point I should've outgrown it. 
COUNSELOR: Well I guess it's kind of like, you can certainly see why you are the way you are. 
CLIENT: Oh yeah. 
COUNSELOR: And also certainly see why (inaudible at 0:30:22.8) you are. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Uh-huh. That's good. Maybe if I (inaudible at 0:30:31.3) one, and found out that I really enjoyed it. Then I would have enough to know that I really enjoyed it. And then I'd know, if I enjoy it this much, it at least gives me the incentive to take the initiative.
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: But I think-I guess kind of, at least the amount of enjoyment you got, of being with this girl, her rejection ultimately kind of destroyed-
CLIENT: Yeah right. It did. Because then-
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:30:58.9)
CLIENT: It was never really completed. It was like it was just, half-there. And that was it. It was really kind of bad. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like-I guess kind of what I'm wondering is, does this also prevent you from taking the initiative in parts (ph) like that might end up like the last time. 
CLIENT: No. I don't think so. Because the last time she took the initiative too. I don't think so no. I mean that's not-I mean you know like I said, if someone-if a woman approached me and said 'Okay, let's go to bed." I wouldn't-I would be happy to answer because (inaudible at 0:31:47.1). But no. I would. 
COUNSELOR: Would you.
CLIENT: Yeah. I would. (inaudible at 0:31:58.7) You know what I mean. As far as-like I said I'd really like to know, what the ultimate outcome would be. 
COUNSELOR: Right. Sometimes [when we say] (ph) the ultimate outcome, we might not want to judge it all at one time. 
CLIENT: Right, right. I understand. Really I do. 
COUNSELOR: Because what's happening is putting a lot of (inaudible at 0:32:26.5) because it might not be so enjoyable because maybe, you're wondering (inaudible at 0:32:32.0). 
CLIENT: Yeah that's true. That's true. Have a regular affair then. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: I guess-now, is it a kind of fear that keeps you from taking the initiative? I mean can you-
CLIENT: I don't really -  really that's the whole thing. What's keeping me from taking the initiative. I don't know. My own head maybe. Particularly the way I was brought up. Saying I don't (inaudible0:32:55.6) sex with women. Play with her. Don't ever. It's just like-she's the one who guides the way. She's the one who says, "Yes." She's the one who says, "No." And what she says, you do. You just - 
COUNSELOR: She calls the shots. 
CLIENT: Yeah, she calls the shots. 
COUNSELOR: How does that affect your view, (inaudible at 0:33:25.7) and how you feel that way. 
CLIENT: Suppose she says, "Okay." And she's just going to go and approach me off the street. Not the way our society is (inaudible at 0:33:42.6). At least a society that has (inaudible at 0:33:46.9). 
COUNSELOR: And I kind of sense that you just see yourself more, at a loss. That you don't know how to go about doing it? (inaudible at 0:34:03.7) I sense that you feel like you want to take the initiative. (inaudible at 0:34:10.5)
CLIENT: Yeah I-I. I don't know if I want to or not. The only way I would take an initiative or any sort of initiative, if I had a sign from her. It's the only way. 
COUNSELOR: And what it mean if you didn't have a sign and you took initiative. 
CLIENT: If I didn't have a sign and I took the initiative. That would mean that she would, flat (ph) down that she would say, "Yes." 
COUNSELOR: Well and I guess, just a suggestion. 
(crosstalk)
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:34:58.7) I'm just afraid of doing-(inaudible at 0:35:02.1). I can - 
COUNSELOR: Kind of unique theory. And get yourself together - 
CLIENT: Yeah you finally-yeah and you finally get enough nerve to stop and then you say, "No." Yeah, that might be it. And you say, "No" too. 
COUNSELOR: kind of like maybe-like if she said, "Yes." I guess you'd kind of feel, well that's okay. 
CLIENT: Yeah, right. 
COUNSELOR: but if there was kind of like-the worst thing that could happen is that you could (inaudible at 0:35:32.4). Kind of like, where are you any difference in the way you are now. That's kind of the (inaudible at 0:35:41.2) that you could slap down. 
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: That's kind of like-
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It's a whole lot more scary because, you feel like you let yourself down and do not have anything. 
CLIENT: That's true. I (inaudible at 0:36:02.5) a big fat "No" to. I'm the type of person that really takes this-really personally. And something else-you really-okay, hell with you. You know but I did take it personally. 
COUNSELOR: You're kind of taking it (inaudible at 0:36:23.5). 
CLIENT: Right. I know. Yeah right. Even I-I want to feel close to her. At (ph) a dance. And she would say, "No." I'd kind of take as a rejection. 
COUNSELOR: Did that, happen to you? 
CLIENT: Oh yeah. When we-when I was in high school. Of course it didn't-it didn't stop me from asking any others to dance, but I did, have a feeling of you know, (inaudible at 0:37:01.4). I may have sulked for a minute or two. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like they were setting (ph) your emotions. 
CLIENT: Yeah. [Not a whole lot] (ph) but they were all-I've come to the conclusion, just to, now it really wasn't anything. You know, but at that point it was something, asking a girl to dance in high school and then she said, "No."
COUNSELOR: Is that kind of like-like then that would be (inaudible at 0:37:31.8). 
CLIENT: Oh yeah it was. It really was. 
COUNSELOR: Because like now taking the initiative (ph) and (inaudible at 0:37:36.3). 
CLIENT: Yeah. Of course I wouldn't even ask the girl if she would like to go to bed with me. I couldn't. It would be like-I wouldn't ask her if she wanted to go to bed. I don't think I could. I really don't. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:37:54.0). 
CLIENT: Yeah right. That's true. That's true. But I-
COUNSELOR: You just can't see yourself doing it.
CLIENT: No I couldn't. I really-I don't have that (inaudible at 0:38:12.1). [Really ask her] (ph) if she really wanted to go to bed with me.
COUNSELOR: What-it's kind of like you get the idea [that she won't] (ph) respond to you. Or (inaudible0:38:28.1).
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: It seems like (inaudible at 0:38:32.7). 
CLIENT: That's right. You don't even kiss a girl unless you have respect for her. That's the way it was. You don't even kiss a girl unless you really have respect for her. You really like this person, but you don't even kiss a girl. And that's the way it was. You don't-it was like you just don't. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:39:01.2) Anything that kind of (inaudible at 0:39:04.9).
CLIENT: (inaudible at 0:39:07.4) I just-I just think back to the things that, being brought up the way I was. Look back at the things that had been said. It was just like, (inaudible at 0:39:22.5) it really wasn't. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of regret the way you were brought up. 
CLIENT: Oh yeah, you know- going to grammar school. You just don't-you don't go near a girl. You don't have any girl-boy things. And stuff like that. Oh, I remember, in grammar school, I'd [go on] (ph) a retreat and all the girls would leave and the boys would stay. It was just one, retreat. That was pretty-it was very exciting. But they said, oh God. "Never masturbate. And if you ever experience an erection, make the sign of the cross and it will just go away." 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:40:17.2)
CLIENT: Oh yeah, it's bad. You really had to say the prayer and it would just go away. And then, they'd show, Walt Disney movies and shows like that. It was like, "And don't you dare laugh." It was like-yeah, but you know, brainwashed children like this. (inaudible at 0:40:46.2) Chicago. 
COUNSELOR: It was kind of like-
CLIENT: In a way you could do it too. 
COUNSELOR: In a way you really kind of, feel like you've been brainwashed. 
CLIENT: Oh yeah-I can-I'm, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:41:00.1)
(crosstalk)
CLIENT: Yeah. I felt that I had been brainwashed. And I still think that it wasn't good. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:41:05.9)
CLIENT: Even if I was, (inaudible at 0:41:10.9) everybody else is concerned, I-my body (inaudible at 0:41:13.1) every day. But, now I don't though. But I still-I say to myself I'll go back one day. I'd love to (inaudible at 0:41:23.5). It's part of me and I believe in it. I don't know if I-yeah, I believe in it. I believe in it. And it's part of me. (inaudible at 0:41:35.9) 
COUNSELOR: How does it feel?
CLIENT: Feels kind of nice. It wasn't-things have changed a little bit, as far as, everything else was concerned. It was kind of nice. It was - I think I may go back and take it up again. (inaudible at 0:41:58.1) But you know it's like, I can't really be a part of it because living in sin, I could never-I could never receive holy communion and I could never really fulfill the whole bit unless I confess. And, that's what's, (inaudible at 0:42:16.8). 
COUNSELOR: Going to confession?
CLIENT: It wasn't worth up to the sense that I was afraid to go, no. And go up and tell them and afraid of being balled out probably. 
COUNSELOR: Being afraid of (inaudible at 0:42:27.9) living in sin and being afraid of telling them.
CLIENT: Telling them about my-you know, myself and my sex life and everything else. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: How does this-you know like your homosexual experiences-
CLIENT: Yeah, right. Oh God, yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 10:42:27.9).
CLIENT: Oh yeah. Right. I really am afraid to go and tell them, what it was. Which I -  which they say I shouldn't be. We were always -  that's the way I'd been, the way I was brought up. And I didn't have too many-there was a couple of times (inaudible at 0:42:59.4), you were balled out in the confessional. But nothing really, terribly [would go down] (ph). You were always afraid to (inaudible at 0:43:05.8) because you were afraid of what you might experience inside the confessional.
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like-I kind of sense like you feel that you really are (inaudible at 0:43:17.7)-
CLIENT: Oh yeah, I do. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:20.8).
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Not as much-
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:28.4).
CLIENT: Yeah, not as much-like I said I just kind of tried to block the whole thing out of my mind. But it always came up. Yeah, I had the feeling that I had been doing something wrong. (inaudible at 0:43:42.9). 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:43:44.4). 
CLIENT: Yeah right, yeah. (inaudible at 0:43:48.7) terrible. Yet you know you'd (inaudible at 0:43:51.8) and you had all these flames (inaudible at 0:43:53.9)-all these flames and the skeleton and all that stuff. 
COUNSELOR: It made a real big impression on you. 
CLIENT: Yeah, it was really something else. It was really-Oh God. And then he showed us-he showed us his impression of heaven. And the glorious clouds and music. And, Mary standing up there. Oh it was-it was really really (inaudible at 0:44:13.4). You were sitting there crying and caring. You know but I mean at that age, anything that's something like that, wow. 
COUNSELOR: It sounds like to me you feel like you're (inaudible at 0:44:26.9). 
CLIENT: I do. I'm convinced of it really. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: I'm kind of sensing you're really critical of your homosexual experiences-
CLIENT: Yeah. (laughs)
COUNSELOR: Are sort of evil and repulsive (inaudible at 0:44:38.5). 
CLIENT: Yeah right. It-yeah right. And I feel-unless of course-and then going back, and it really sounds silly. And I know it sounds silly. But you know if I just (inaudible at 0:44:49.6) get away from it and then, just kind of let the whole thing-never have another homosexual relationship, with anybody. And confess everything that I had done. And then, everything would be fine. And end up in heaven again. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:45:04.8)
CLIENT: Right. 
COUNSELOR: And you'll be (inaudible at 0:45:07.7). 
CLIENT: Right, right. Yeah, that's it. That's what [we were] (ph) taught. (inaudible at 0:45:11.0) Cleansed. (inaudible at 0:45:14.3). 
COUNSELOR: (CLIENT: at 0:45:16.3)
CLIENT: No no. I don't. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:45:22.1). 
CLIENT: I was at up my parents' house and (inaudible at 0:45:24.2) came up and he was like, "Are you going to heaven? Do you think you're going to heaven?" And I said, "No." (laughs) You know I think that-God (ph), I shouldn't have said that. If I had been someone who said, "Well probably. I don't know." Or something like this. Yeah something like that. I told him really frank, I just said, "No." And I thought, "Oh wow. He must think I'm really crazy." (inaudible at 0:45:48.5) Then he said, "Oh would you like to go." And I said, "Oh, sure." (inaudible at 0:45:52.6) something at his church. It was really something else. It was funny. I had to laugh. Though, it was funny. It really broke her up. 
COUNSELOR: Could you-could you say more about, like how that come (inaudible at 0:46:07.3)?
CLIENT: A fear.
COUNSELOR: A what?
CLIENT: A fear.
COUNSELOR: A fear?
CLIENT: A fear of God, a fear of burning in hell. (inaudible at 0:46:17.0).
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:18.6) 
CLIENT: Yeah. I feel kind of bad. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:24.4)
CLIENT: Yeah right. (inaudible at 0:46:29.6) they will come. 
COUNSELOR: And kind of like-I guess in part also, you were, trying to stop having these homosexual experiences? 
CLIENT: Oh yeah. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:42.3)
CLIENT: Yeah right. I mean (ph) like I said, (inaudible at 0:46:48.2) and things like that. Yeah right. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:46:50.6) trying to stifle that, but can't quite see how to get to, a heterosexual relationship.
CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible at 0:47:01.0)
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:47:02.9) They hadn't offered it.
CLIENT: Right. And with their own (inaudible at 0:47:07.6), not even married. I'm really, ready to, you know, get married, right. And just to feel like a (inaudible at 0:47:15.6) right. And then you know, I'll take [that chance] (ph) my number, (inaudible at 0:47:19.9).
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:47:21.8)
(crosstalk)
CLIENT: That would really-that would make them feel bad as, living a homosexual way of life.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, having intercourse outside of marriage is, a sin but it's (inaudible at 0:47:35.1). 
CLIENT: Yeah, yes yes yes. It's not really bad. 
COUNSELOR: (inaudible0:47:39.2) 
CLIENT: Yeah right. It did. It's really not that bad at all. But you know. It is sad, words (ph) like sinner, I mean I did confess it. They didn't say something. And I thought to myself, "Well why didn't they say something." Why didn't they say, "Well, do this or do that." Instead of saying, "Oh no you shouldn't' do that. Seven 'Hail Marys' and Seven 'Our Fathers' and your sins will be forgiven." And that point, you really couldn't say you were repenting because you really couldn't say, you weren't going to go and do the same thing again. In order to really repent, you just have to really have it on your mind you aren't going to do that again. And you're never going to do it again. Of course I tried, to-
COUNSELOR: Did you-confess about the homosexual experience. 
CLIENT: Oh yeah when I was, in high school. No-I wasn't in high school. (inaudible at 0:48:48.0). Yeah. Oh-well when I was in high school, it was masturbation and things like that. And that was a 'no' too. Don't do that either. 
COUNSELOR: They told you, "No." 
CLIENT: Yeah right.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:49:00.6). 
CLIENT: Yeah right. You know they said, "No." It was something wrong. And pray to the Blessed Mary for, guidance and that stuff. (inaudible at 0:49:14.8) That was, really kind of rotten when you think about it. You know they just have an opportunity to really help people and don't, even- and yet (inaudible at 0:49:29.1) nothing goes further. 
(crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: It's like you're told it's wrong but-
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:49:35.5)
CLIENT: What I do.
COUNSELOR: It's like you really want to help them find-
CLIENT: Yeah right. 
COUNSELOR: What they're doing for you. 
CLIENT: Yeah right.
COUNSELOR: But you haven't gotten it yet. 
CLIENT: That right. I wouldn't have been there, if I didn't feel bad about-I would never have said anything if I didn't feel bad about it. And-they'd know it. So why didn't they do anything about it. I don't know. Yeah that's - . (inaudible at 0:49:55.4) They tell you all these 'don'ts' but when you do it they don't tell you how not to. 
COUNSELOR: Just tell you you're evil. 
CLIENT: Yeah. Tell you you're bad. No. But you'll be good after you say these two prayers. (inaudible at 0:50:11.2).
COUNSELOR: Yeah, I kind of really -  it's kind of like you expect (ph) the kind of feeling that "I'm broken" and you want (inaudible at 0:50:25.0). Same kind of sexual (inaudible at 0:50:27.7). 
CLIENT: Never lied to myself and say, "Oh God."
COUNSELOR: You really don't want that. 
CLIENT: No-yeah, I don't think anybody did to tell you the truth. I find it very very [hard to believe] (ph). 
COUNSELOR: But yet you can't quite-see over the heterosexual movement (ph).
CLIENT: No I can't. Now I often wonder, (inaudible at 0:50:58.0) think I'm pretty-the ultimate, that had been brought up in the Catholic religion. (inaudible at 0:51:03.5) How do they find their way around heterosexual relationships. It's beyond me. But everybody's different. That's the thing. 
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, you can't find your way. 
CLIENT: Yeah right. That's it. That's it. Can't find your way.
COUNSELOR: Does it kind of feel-kind of, different and (inaudible at 0:51:35.8)? 
CLIENT: No. 
COUNSELOR: Pardon?
CLIENT: No. I wouldn't do-well. Yeah there's a sense of hopelessness but there's still hope. Because as long as I, you know, as I keep on trying, maybe. 
COUNSELOR: When you say, "Trying.", I just kind of-
CLIENT: Kind of (inaudible at 0:51:57.7) right. (inaudible at 0:51:59.3). 
COUNSELOR: But trying I guess is also trying to take an interest (ph) too. 
CLIENT: Yeah but that's a different-that's a whole different thing. 
COUNSELOR: A different way. 
CLIENT: Yeah right. (inaudible at 0:52:12.6). 
COUNSELOR: They're not-I guess the ways (ph) aren't, opposed to be each other and in fact they work well together.
CLIENT: Yeah that's true. That's true. Maybe, (inaudible at 0:52:24.5). 
COUNSELOR: Yeah because I just feel like, when you're talking about taking (inaudible at 0:52:33.4), what you're trying to say more is, in a sense you (inaudible at 0:52:38.4), being put down.
CLIENT: Yeah. And I thought that maybe, if I were to take the initiative, I'd still wouldn't take the initiative to someone who I didn't feel committed to, a commitment to. Even I would take the initiative. 
COUNSELOR: Is that because (inaudible at 0:52:57.7).
CLIENT: That, and the feeling that, "Okay if I did take the initiative, this person might feel that I am feeling committed. That I am committing myself at that point too."
COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:53:19.0) you were kind of-
CLIENT: Yeah right. You said, "Okay. Okay you don't know [if you] (ph) could get married to something like this." And you know, I said I don't feel that I could put myself in that type of a situation, at the place where I am now. The sexual thing I have now, I couldn't put myself into that kind of position. For this person's sake, and my sake. For that matter I couldn't.
COUNSELOR: Kind of like, you do want to get married, you want it to be the rightful (ph) kind of marriage.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I want to make sure. Marriage is a-a life thing for me. It's not really-I think that's it's really-that's it. Of course someone was talking about this concept where they (inaudible at 10:53:19.0). And kind of an agreement with that also. Not-not because of sex. Sex within (ph) a marriage, but-
COUNSELOR: I don't know (inaudible at 0:54:17.0). 
CLIENT: I said to them, "And if you were married and you're going to stay (ph) up to five years, you don't think you could live with this person. You just say, "Okay." (inaudible at 0:54:26.3) There isn't really a big divorce or anything. You just don't sign the next contract. But, I just think that-I think I'm kind of in agreement with that. Not just because of sex, because of the situation that I'm in. But I think it's very difficult for any two people to live with one another. And, if you've signed that is going to-(inaudible at 0:54:51.1) for five years. You really stand a chance of doing it. It's really, kind of hard to get out of it. That's why I'd be in kind of agreement with that. But it's still a big commitment, especially when you (inaudible at 0:55:02.9) and things like that. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah but it's kind of like, you really, want to eventually get married and to love. Kind of like you really can't see (inaudible at 0:55:17.2). 
CLIENT: Yeah. That's true. Not-a kind of life that's, good. A life that's sharing things and doing things, just together a lot. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you live a life that's sharing the good things and bad things with somebody, (inaudible at 0:55:37.6). 
CLIENT: Yeah that's right. Just, talking, you know stuff like that. It's kind of life that I lived, with all this really crud-you know this is it. 
COUNSELOR: You need to live then-the part of the (inaudible at 0:55:53.7) that will make you feel that (inaudible at 0:55:56.9). Made that kind of life hard for you.
CLIENT: God, yeah right. It's always, well, you're going to get married and have kids some day. And the whole society is geared toward that life. All of society is geared toward that life today. It's like they look down on someone who isn't. 
COUNSELOR: And all-
CLIENT: Especially a girl, my God. 
COUNSELOR: It's like the society is geared toward that kind of living and, you're going to have to be outside that way of living. 
CLIENT: Yeah I would. Yeah. That's it.
COUNSELOR: And kind of have a fear of it, that-
CLIENT: Oh yeah right. 
COUNSELOR: That you'll be-that (inaudible at 0:56:32.5) you do, (inaudible at 0:56:33.6). 
CLIENT: Yeah right. Right. 
COUNSELOR: That kind of hell on earth.
CLIENT: Being in this one or the next one too. Sounds like a big deal.
COUNSELOR: I've got to stop now (ph), I've got a - .
CLIENT: Okay. 
COUNSELOR: Now look we should set up times (inaudible at 0:56:51.8). 
CLIENT: Okay times yeah. 
COUNSELOR: Now you-teach right?
CLIENT: Right, right. So...
COUNSELOR: What, what, what are your times that you - . [0:57:04.3]
