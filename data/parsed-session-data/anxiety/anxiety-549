BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Thank you.  So how are you?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm better.  It's generally fatigue, you know?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'm just, you know, like today, like I wake up in the morning and I just feel weak.  I feel like I've been run over by a truck.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, and it lasts all day or just?
<b>PT:</b> Today it's lasted until really about ready to come here and kind of, you know, out of it, but it's been a stressful week because I had a doctor's appointment on Monday, it was with [NAME OTHER], I find those sessions, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Is she doing hypnotherapy with you?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And it usually takes it out of me and then I had an appointment, 2 appointments on Wednesday with, actually I had 2 doctors' appointments on Monday and 2 on Wednesday, 2 on Thursday -
<b>DR:</b> Well that's a lot.
<b>PT:</b> Then 1 today, so I met with, uh, my endocrinologist sent me over to see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who's another endocrinologist.  Um, because for a long time the different doctors I've seen have thought the pituitary gland is not right, so, um, and now [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and my appointment was for 11:30 and I left his office at 1:30.
<b>DR:</b> Waiting or seeing him all that time?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I waited about 45 minutes and then I, the nurse caught up my history and I waited another 20 minutes in the examining room and then he came in, and he's probably spent about 2 minutes with me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> He told me that he didn't want to compete with another endocrinologist.
<b>DR:</b> He didn't want to what?
<b>PT:</b> Compete.
<b>DR:</b> What did he mean by that?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I didn't understand what he was trying to say either and, um, because I've seen so many of them, um, I had seen him actually in 2005.
<b>DR:</b> Did he remember?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think he remembered me.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But, uh, uh, I was referred over by [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] who's at [DEIDENTIFIED], he's an endocrinologist, so I thought they all worked together.  And, uh, he said, you know, your doctor's perfectly capable of ordering these tests himself.  And I thought but he is kind of the authority as far as, um, pituitary and my doctor's very young.  He just comes there from [DEIDENTIFIED] so I followed him over there.  And, um, I said to him, um, you know, my estrogen's way too low, I've had several endocrinologists and doctors tell me that my progesterone's too low and my DHEA was coming at one time just, you know, not even measurable.  And he said, well, who's following up on all these things, and I said, well, really no one and I talked to him about the, I talked to his nurse about the, uh, my ferritin levels being too low too.  And, uh, and I said, well, look can I become your patient exclusively and would that, you know, make you happy and satisfied, your requirements?  And, uh, he said, look, and so he wrote down, he scheduled the, um, pituitary test on [DATE] and then he wrote down and any other test, you know, required.  So I also had an appointment with my endocrinologist that day that I went back to him and, um, because I said to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], well, he said to me, he said you've already mentioned some tests that should be done.  He says, not only the DHEA, the testosterone, everything should be measured at one time.  And he said your doctor could have done that.  So I went back to my doctor and he was kind of, he said, well, he's a little bit of a quirky guy.  He said, I said, well, why, can you sign off on me and just release me as your patient and talk to him?  And he said I think it would be in your best interest to do that.  And I said, well, for now, I said, I hate leaving you because we get along so well, but I think that he can do all this testing, so, um, and my son who has Klinefelter's .  I said, will you -
<b>DR:</b> Your son?
<b>PT:</b> My son who has Klinefelter's.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, the one I met?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, right.  I asked if he would take him as a patient and he said to me, well, who is he seeing?
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I said, well, he has seen an endocrinologist, I said, he's seen a urologist, he said well, I'll compete with a urologist.  So he said, yes, I'll be happy to see him.  So it was just kind of a strange kind of, you know, kind of a interview with him.  But then they told me in [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER]'s office that he is actually not part of [DEIDENTIFIED], he is in private practice.  So I don't know how all of this works, but they say [DATE] they'll do the tests.  What they give me is L-Dopa and they'll challenge the pituitary gland and measure my human growth hormone.  And I guess, uh, at that time I'll talk about doing all the other tests, because, uh, I know that, um, a signal that there's something wrong with my pituitary glands that all these hormones are coming in way too low.  And, you know, I've got too much testosterone, I'm not converting DHEA it's going into testosterone and it's not trickling down into any of the estrogens, so something's wrong there.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe that could be contributing to the fatigue factor.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I definitely -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> The pituitary not working right.
<b>DR:</b> Because you don't seem as depressed as before.
<b>PT:</b> No, and I think it's related to human growth hormone and having these hormones balanced and that's what the compounding pharmacist has been saying to me for a long time is that your hormones are out of balance.  You know, you've got all the symptoms of everything being out of whack.  He said even your thyroid's not in, in range, and it isn't.  And they've been picking up on that too, so, um, I have to go over Monday and have a TSA, TSH measured again because it was too, coming in to low, I've been getting too much thyroid hormone again.  So it's like the pituitary gland is, they're all saying the pituitary gland is just reacting so sensitive to minute changes in thyroid hormone, it's just, so I'm never in the range.  I mean, hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, I can't seem to get in range.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, but your mood seems a little -
<b>PT:</b> My mood is better.  I'm, I, uh, I still have some anxiety like driving here my son drove here and, uh, I would have driven past here.  [LAUGHING].  Um -
<b>DR:</b> You get anxious about driving?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no I, I, I like the idea that he, you know, he, he likes to drive me because he's very nice.  He's doing me a favor and he is.  But, um -
<b>DR:</b> Is he off now from school or?
<b>PT:</b> No, he had class this morning.  So, uh -
<b>DR:</b> Now your husband and your other son are back already, they left and -
<b>PT:</b> Right, oh, they got back on Sunday.
<b>DR:</b> How was that for you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I was really glad to see them and I saw some pictures and I wish I'd been there with, you know, [DEIDENTIFIED] was founded in 1424 and they have a lot of, they chose to go with their graduation, they have a church service beforehand and then they have, they gowned him.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum, so you're sad you missed it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm really sad I missed it.  He had his white bowtie on and his girlfriend came out from Spain to see him too and, um, she was sorry that I wasn't there.
<b>DR:</b> You've met her though?
<b>PT:</b> Pardon?
<b>DR:</b> You've met her though?
<b>PT:</b> I met, I have met her though and, uh, you know, my son confided in me that, uh, you know, she was really sick, think I may have told you, in Spain and I mean she does have herpes.  Now he's tested positive for it now too.  So he has not been ill but she was really, really ill and she, you know, that he told me that, uh, the way she thinks, she got her mother talked to, she finally confided in her mother and father the doctor and, um, her mother had been molested by an uncle who was a priest who was schizophrenic and her mother has herpes and she told [NAME OTHER] when she was very young she was molested by this priest too, so she thinks that that's where it came, because she's not a, what's the word I want, a loose living girl really.
<b>DR:</b> The girlfriend isn't?
<b>PT:</b> No.  So she's been very studious.  She speaks 5 languages.
<b>DR:</b> How old is she?
<b>PT:</b> [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> Is he serious about her?
<b>PT:</b> I think he likes her a lot, but I don't know.  So, you know, all of this that he takes the LSAT exam tomorrow morning but he just got back last Sunday and he's been studying very hard for that.
<b>DR:</b> Is he nervous about it?
<b>PT:</b> I think he is.  He's been, you know, just making that transition to the sleep, the jet lag thing, and then they took the exam, 2 trial exams the last 2 days and he did lower on them than he's been doing, and like 15 points and he says that made such a big difference, so anyway.
<b>DR:</b> He wants to go to school here in [DEIDENTIFIED] or?
<b>PT:</b> No, he probably want to go out of state.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, but I hope I can get this fatigue under control.  You know, I just think it's, it's such a weird thing that I feel.  You know, I feel it in my shoulders and my neck -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And my heart.  I just feel -
<b>DR:</b> You don't feel able to exercise?
<b>PT:</b> No, I still have this dizziness, you know, it's almost like an anxiety that brings, you know, I don't know where this anxiety is coming from.  Um, last night I only had to take half of a half of a Klonopin with the, um, Luvox and that seemed to be okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, you could cut down, sure.
<b>PT:</b> And I haven't been able to, I haven't had to take it during the day, although tonight my husband wants me to go to a Christmas party with the people he works with and I might have to take it.
<b>DR:</b> You could do it, take it before you go.  You don't drink anything, so -
<b>PT:</b> No, I won't.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, do it, it'll help make it easier for you.  You're not looking forward to it or?
<b>PT:</b> I'm so tired I just, you know, it just seems like more of an ordeal than -
<b>DR:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED] or local or?
<b>PT:</b> Up in [DEIDENTIFIED], he works up in [DEIDENTIFIED]so -
<b>DR:</b> But he'll drive.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he'll come home early and then we'll change and, I've just been so tired I, when he was out of town it really was more relaxing.  When [NAME OTHER] and I are together it's -
<b>DR:</b> Why is that, the expectations from him?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because we ate dinner early and, uh, I didn't, um, you know, I cook dinner every night and, uh, I usually make a nice dinner and I, but I never know when he's going to be home exactly.  So, uh, [NAME OTHER] is just kind of low keyed and he doesn't really expect a lot and we went out to dinner to a restaurant on Sunday, Saturday night before they got home.
<b>DR:</b> Um, did you enjoy that?
<b>PT:</b> And I, you know, enjoyed that.  And my other son is kind of, uh, my other son is so difficult.
<b>DR:</b> Why is that?
<b>PT:</b> He has an extreme temper.  And he's, um, he can't seem to get focused on anything.  If he's interested in something it's 1000%, if he's not then it's difficult and he's really bright, but he's very frustrated and he's like angry all the time.  He's kind of mean.
<b>DR:</b> Is he similar to your husband in a way like that?
<b>PT:</b> No.  No, he's, and he just doesn't get around to doing things and he's, right now he's -
<b>DR:</b> Frustrated?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's, he's sick too, he has the bronchitis and an ear infection and a touch of pneumonia so he's home in bed with an antibiotic.  Actually I'm on an antibiotic right now too for a bacterial infection since I get a lot of infections.  I think being on antibiotic makes me very tired too.  So but he's taking a codeine cough syrup and -
<b>DR:</b> How's he going to take the exam?
<b>PT:</b> Well, this is my other son.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  [LAUGHING].
<b>PT:</b> My oldest, my oldest boy.  There's [NAME OTHER], and then [NAME OTHER] is the one who got a degree in Scotland, he's [AGE], [NAME OTHER]'s [AGE].
<b>DR:</b> And he's the one with the pneumonia.  Or he doesn't have pneumonia?
<b>PT:</b> He has a touch of it, so he's, but he -
<b>DR:</b> What does he do?
<b>PT:</b> He was selling insurance and now he's just, it's just not, nobody's buying anything so he's moved back home.
<b>DR:</b> He does not work?
<b>PT:</b> No, he's been looking for a job but he told me he said he's feeling very stressed out trying to find something.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's a tough economy to find a job.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> How do you feel about him being home?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I like all my children being home, but he's, you know, he has his coffee, he leaves, he leaves everything out.  He used to be such a perfectionist, now it's like he doesn't care.  His room is a mess -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And, um, I'm kind of worried about him to be honest with you.
<b>DR:</b> You think he's depressed?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think he is.  Um, he had a girlfriend for 5 years and she wanted to get married and we really enjoyed her and he didn't want to get married so they just broke it off and -
<b>DR:</b> How long ago was that?
<b>PT:</b> About, uh, about a year and a half ago.
<b>DR:</b> Does he miss her?
<b>PT:</b> I think at first he did, that he regretted it, but, um, because they were very creative together.  She was an opera singer and a graphic art designer and he met her in college.  Now he's going out with someone who's, he's [AGE], she's [AGE].  She's heiress to the [DEIDENTIFIED] fortune.
<b>DR:</b> The [DEIDENTIFIED] sausage?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, ham and all that.  And she's 1 of 12 children.
<b>DR:</b> How did he meet her?
<b>PT:</b> At the union league club.
<b>DR:</b> Do you like her, have you met?
<b>PT:</b> I've never met her.  So -
<b>DR:</b> How do you feel about the age difference?
<b>PT:</b> Well, he's, you know, he's old enough to know, he says he enjoys her company.  I don't know, she's never been married.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know what kind of family, husband has said, you just have to marry that woman, and he said I will never [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> He doesn't want, but he never met her either.
<b>PT:</b> No, we've never met her.
<b>DR:</b> You want to meet her?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I would meet her.  My husband had a chance, he dropped [NAME OTHER] off downtown and asked, he said do you want to come in and meet her, and my husband said no which I think was wrong.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, why [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I asked him a lot of questions about her, so -
<b>DR:</b> Is he open about?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he's pretty open, my boys are pretty open with me, they're not with their father, but they, I get all the dirt.  [LAUGHING].  And my son [NAME OTHER], the one who has Klinefelter's, had been going out with a woman who was [AGE] and he's [AGE].  They did not like that idea at all.  But she's moved down to, uh, Louisiana and now he wants to go down and visit her after Christmas.
<b>DR:</b> You didn't like it because of the age difference or there were other reasons?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I haven't met her.  He met her through the internet and, uh, it seems like she's kind of a, kind of a bohemian existence and I don't, I think he's, it's his first person he's ever gone out with and -
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> I think they had a very close relationship and I don't know, I would, I would like to meet her but he's bought him his ticket to go down and, uh, I know that my husband's just going to have a fit about it so I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> It's interesting 2 of the boys are dating such older women.  That's, wonder what's the reason for that?
<b>PT:</b> Probably because they've always been taken care of by a woman.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That's what I'm thinking.
<b>DR:</b> But he's not, you're not worried about him being depressed though?
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER], I think it's, he has a lot of anxiety I think because he does do a lot of things.  Um, he's very sweet.  He took my father in law's wife, his third wife, the others have died, took her to get her hair done the other day and my father in law was busy and, uh, she's, she's very found of him when the rest of the family doesn't like her very much.  I get along just fine with her too.  I think they're being difficult because she's practically [AGE].  And the neighbor next door who's [AGE], [NAME OTHER] buys flowers for her and takes it over.  He was great friends with her husband who passed away 2 years ago and she makes cookies for him and he used to cut her grass and now her youngest son is home living with her who's an alcoholic.  But [NAME OTHER] has a real conscience about things and it snows he's the one who goes out and shovels the driveway and helps get the trash out and -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.  Well he's caretaking.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, he is.  And we've -
<b>DR:</b> Has he come to deal with the Klinefelter's or?
<b>PT:</b> He has.  Um, we only found out he had it when he was [AGE], um, and I knew that there was, as I say, there was something wrong -
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> For a long time and I just didn't know what but he was very withdrawn and he gets along well with older people but he doesn't get along, doesn't have many friends his own age.  He, um, he goes to France every summer with a group from [DEIDENTIFIED] on a wine tasting tour and that's kind of his hobby is wine.  Um, and he goes over to [DEIDENTIFIED] and [DEIDENTIFIED] and he gets along with the French and the Belgian guy over there and the chef and that's the kind of company for him to go over and have a glass of wine.  And he goes to school.  He's a good student.  He works very hard.
<b>DR:</b> Hm.
<b>PT:</b> So I think maybe next year, it'd be good for him to go away to school as much as I would hate that.
<b>DR:</b> You'd miss him?
<b>PT:</b> I'd miss him a lot.  I think it'd be good for him.  So I'm kind of up and down a little bit.  When I saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] we decided to keep the Luvox at the 200.
<b>DR:</b> That's fine, we can go higher.
<b>PT:</b> Which seems fine, but if I start feeling like I'm getting depressed again she may take it up 50.
<b>DR:</b> Well, let's keep it there.  Because you're on the estrogen too, right, right now too, so I think the combination will boost the mood.  So and you definitely seem much, much calmer than [INAUDIBLE].  So I'd just keep the medicine the way it is and then we'll continue with those hypnotherapy sessions and see where they take you.  I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> I still feel like I'm a little, I'm like out of it, you know.  I feel like I'm inebriated at times.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's why [INAUDIBLE] higher in those.  I'd love you to do some exercises.  Is there anything you can do?
<b>PT:</b> Well, I have a, I have gotten out more, so I've got all my Christmas shopping done.
<b>DR:</b> It's cold though.  But, I mean, you don't have like a machine at home, a treadmill or bike or something?
<b>PT:</b> No, I was thinking of going over to, um, I can go over to [DEIDENTIFIED] you can walk there in the mornings before they open the mall and my father in law has a pool in his condominium I could go there.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> How about that, yeah, we talked about that last time.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so I have a friend, [NAME OTHER], who'd go with me and, uh -
<b>DR:</b> What about him?
<b>PT:</b> Well, my father in law goes to [DEIDENTIFIED] because he had heart surgery and doesn't work out.  He wants me to go with him but they won't take me until I get a sign off on cardiologist because of my echocardiogram.  I'm still waiting to get in to see that cardiologist, although -
<b>DR:</b> Well, go to his pool there.  I mean, if you go there 20 minutes a day, how far, is, he's not too far?
<b>PT:</b> It's about 5 miles.
<b>DR:</b> What?
<b>PT:</b> He's about 5 miles away.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, go over there.  Try to do 20 minutes a day of swimming and I think that'll supplement the medicine you're on.  So you don't need any refills on anything?  You're okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I was going to ask, I'm, I think a patch would be better than just taking this estrogen at one -
<b>DR:</b> Patch is fine.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I don't know how that would work because I was going to ask you for a prescription on this because I've got my last refill from the last psychiatrist.  Um, for the estradiol and I can ask, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] if he can make it into a patch, I don't know if he can.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, ask him if he can do that.  If you're comfortable with this, it's much easier.
<b>PT:</b> So and you mentioned that the, um, Klonopin comes in like a sublingual.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I might, I'd -
<b>DR:</b> You want that?
<b>PT:</b> I do, and I'd carry that with me and -
<b>DR:</b> Let's see how that goes.
<b>PT:</b> The other thing that's kind of [INAUDIBLE] and I've had several of them which shows just questioning as I always do whether or not I have vasculitis.
<b>DR:</b> It's common as we age.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] changes?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, that's common.
<b>PT:</b> There's the lesion.
<b>DR:</b> Pardon?
<b>PT:</b> I have some lesions.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah -
