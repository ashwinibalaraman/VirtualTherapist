<font size="4"><b>Chapter 29: Existential Cross-Cultural Counseling: When Hearts and Cultures Share</b></font>

<b>CLEMMONT E. VONTRESS AND LAWRENCE R. EPP</b>


DURING THE PAST 30 years,
counselors have come to recognize
the impact of culture on therapeutic
relationships, diagnoses, and the
techniques they use to help clients. During
the 1950s and 1960s, counselors generally
considered counseling to be counseling; that
is, theories and techniques that worked with
one group of clients would work with
another group, regardless of cultural background
(Jackson, 1995). One indication of
how far the helping professions have
departed from this position is the <i>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV)</i>, which has been prepared to
incorporate an awareness that the manual is
used in culturally diverse populations in the
United States and internationally (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. xxiv).
Although significant advances have been
made in recognizing that clients are reflections
of the cultures in which they have been
socialized, a theoretical framework still
does not exist to help counselors work effectively
with culturally different clients who
do not fit comfortably within the worldviews
of the American psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral,
and humanistic approaches to
counseling. The purpose of this chapter is to
offer an existential model of cross-cultural
counseling, but the sticky issue of defining
the culturally different client will remain a
philosophical and practical challenge.


Three or four decades ago, counselors, psychologists,
psychiatrists, and social workers
began to call attention to the problems they
encountered in working with the culturally
deprived, the culturally disadvantaged, and
African American (or "Negro") clients. During
the 1970s, the literature that described
the dimensions of the problems presented
by such clients increased (Jackson, 1987,
1995). At the same time, some universities
introduced graduate courses to enhance the
effectiveness of counselors working with the
culturally different (Sue, 1981). These
courses are now required by the various
accreditation bodies in counseling and psychology,

[p. <i>372</i>]

What these courses offer is essentially a
group approach. In other words, there is
today — as there was during the 1960s — the
tendency to generalize about the characteristics
of a minority group in graduate classrooms,
at professional conferences, and in
journal articles and books. Even though
Americans of Hispanic, African, Asian, and
indigenous descent continue to become total
participants in and reflective of the national
culture, it often is assumed that cultural differences
among ethnic groups are readily
distinguishable and easily described. It is
our contention that although there are some
shared values within ethnic groups, there is
a danger of stereotyping ethnic groups if
counselors expect too rigidly a given set of
behaviors from them. Approaching cross-cultural
clients with stereotypes can cause as
much misunderstanding as can approaching
them with stark ignorance of the cultural
values they do hold.


<b>CULTURE</b>


Culture is simultaneously visible and invisible,
conscious and unconscious, and cognitive
and affective. Although most of it is out
of sight and out of mind, it provides humans
with their most essential qualities, which are
transmitted throughout the life cycle by way
of socialization. Culture is the sum total of
their beliefs and procedures for negotiating
environments at each stage of existence
(Vontress, 1986). Most people are products
of five concentric and intersecting cultures:
universal, ecological, national, regional,
and racial/ethnic. The cultures are neither
entirely separate nor equal. The most foundational,
the universal, is biologically determined
and influences all others.


Regardless of the conditions under which
people live, they still must adjust to the fact
that they are humans. For example, African
Americans are, first of all, culturally alike
because they are members of the human species.
As such, they share biologically dictated
behaviors of all members of the
human group. Second, they are forced to
adjust to the same climatic conditions as are
all other Americans. Third, as members of
the national culture, they take on the behavior,
attitudes, and values of Americans in
general. Fourth, they are influenced by the
culture of the region in which they live.
Thus, Marcus, a native of rural Alabama, is
apt to betray his roots by the manner of
speech peculiar to that region. Fifth,
because of Marcus's African ancestry, Euro-Americans
are apt to react to him as if he
were inferior, a fact that leaves psychological
scars on him and on members of his
group (Vontress, 1986).


This perception of culture suggests that
everybody is multicultural in the sense of
being composed of multiple cultural influences
rather than being culturally monolithic.
It also limits the groups that may be
classified as culturally different to those
who share traits that traditionally have
been recognized as cultural — ecological,
regional, national, or racial/ethnic traits —
rather than those who share a universal
characteristic. Therefore, women, gay men
and lesbians, the physically challenged, and
senior citizens are not considered culturally
different because they are socialized in the
same families and under the same cultural
influences as are their male, straight, able-bodied,
and younger siblings and relatives.

[p. <i>373</i>]

<b>AN EXISTENTIAL MODEL OF
CULTURE</b>


Humans are products of their genetic
endowments and life experiences. At conception,
their destinies already are determined
in part by the DNA helix that exists
in every cell. The final shape of that destiny,
however, is influenced by individuals' life
experiences. Human genetics and life experience
intermingle as they are filtered through
five cultural layers. The first one is the <i>universal
culture</i> or the way of life that is indicated
by the physiology of the human species.
People are conceived in a given way,
they must consume nourishment to live, they
grow into adulthood, they contribute to the
welfare of the group, and they grow old and
die. These and other ways of life are invariable
dimensions of human existence. Therefore,
they may be called <i>universal culture</i>.


Human genetic endowment and life
experiences also are shaped by the ecosystem
and the demands that it makes on people's
way of life. The climatic conditions,
indigenous vegetation, animal life, seasonal
changes, and other factors determine how
people interact with nature and themselves.
Obviously, people who must use dog sleighs
to commute to the grocery store see life differently
from those who need only to pluck
their nourishment from trees and plants in
their backyards. Imagine also what it must
be like to live several months of the year in
complete darkness and how such an existence
affects daily activities. For these and
other reasons, it seems tenable to posit the
existence of an <i>ecological culture</i>, the second
ring of the cultural filter.


The third ring of the filter is the <i>national
culture</i>, which derives from the fact that a
stable community of people share the same
territory, heritage, language, economic system,
government, and allegiance to a way of
life for which they are willing to die if necessary.
Although people born abroad may join
the community, they must fit into the culture
already established by earlier generations.
In other words, they are expected to
become <i>acculturated</i> or to take on the culture
of their adopted country. In large measure,
schools serve as primary institutions of
acculturation for young people. However,
everybody needs to learn to negotiate the
culture of the host country. They must learn
its rules and regulations, many of which are
sanctioned by law. The social demands and
expectations that provide self-direction for
individuals in one country usually are inadequate
to ensure comfortable adjustment in
another country.


The fourth cultural layer that helps to
make people into the persons they are is the
<i>regional culture</i>. Many countries manifest
distinct regional differences in terms of language,
dress, customs, and other ways of
life. Regional differences exist for various
reasons. In large countries, different climate
zones influence how people negotiate environmental
differences. In others, proximity
to the borders of neighboring countries contributes
to a blending of cultures along the
boundaries. Regional cultural differences
also often are byproducts of military conquests
and political annexations.

[p. <i>374</i>]

The fifth and final ring is called <i>racial/ethnic</i>,
mainly because racial and ethnic
groups usually reside in separate communities
where they perpetuate their ways of life.
Separatism is especially true in countries
where racial attitudes are such that racially
and ethnically different people feel unwelcome
in the dominant group community. In
Paris, for example, there are sections of the
city where Africans live, a section where
Arabs reside, and other sections where various
other ethnic groups settle in their own
neighborhoods. In New York City, the same
phenomenon is observed. There is not only
a Harlem where African Americans reside
but also a Spanish Harlem where Spanish-speaking
people of color live and perpetuate
their culture. It is unnecessary to debate
whether people choose voluntarily to live
among their own kind or whether they are
forced by the larger society to do so. The
results are the same — a racial/ethnic culture
that is transmitted from one generation to
another. Although people may relocate to
other communities, their cultural roots usually
remain in their communities of origin.


<b>THE CULTURAL DISTILLATE</b>


Individuals are distillates of a cultural filter
consisting of five layers. The filtering continues
throughout their life spans. At each
developmental stage, their genetic endowment
interacts with life experiences to determine
the nature of their existence. Each
human is distinctively different from all others.
As Vontress (1979, 1996) pointed out,
individuals embody four dynamically interactive
"worlds" that can be best described
in the language of German existentialists
(Binswanger, 1962). First, there is the
<i>Eigenwelt</i> or that "private realm" of the
human personality that cannot be shared
with or completely understood by another
person. Second, the <i>Mitwelt</i> suggests that
what people are is a product of their relationships
with others. In fact, many would
say that, no humans really are themselves;
rather, they are composites of the other people —
primarily their parents and siblings —
who shaped their personalities, just as their
genes directed their physical characteristics.
Third, humans are influenced by the
<i>Umwelt</i> or the natural environment. How
people relate to that environment directly
affects the nature of their existence as well
as their personalities. Although the natural
environment often is taken for granted, it
makes the difference between life and death
for thousands of species residing in its
bosom, which is affectionately called
"Mother Nature." Without the natural
environment's nourishment and support,
none would exist. Fourth, humans relate to
the <i>Überwelt</i> or the spirit world. They
require the respect, direction, love, and
affection of parents, elders, departed love
ones, and potent spiritual entities. The spirit
world connects people with those who,
although come and gone, still reside in them
due to memories, genetic contributions, and
cultural indoctrination (Vontress, 1996).
Perhaps this realm also includes intangible
feelings of the here and now such as love,
empathy, devotion, respect, and altruism
that bind the human community together in
mutual understanding with a powerful, if
unseen, emotional glue.


The existential model of culture presented
here highlights the paradoxical complexity
and simplicity of human existence.
Culture should not be viewed separately
from the rest of life; it is the compass of life.
Because people cannot live to adulthood
without a set of practices and procedures
designed to guide their existence, they
require a culture for their orientation and
survival in the world. The model intends to
communicate the notion that acculturation
has a purpose. That purpose is to ensure

[p. <i>375</i>]

During existence, humans must maintain
a working rapport with themselves; that is,
they need to know themselves at all times.
Second, they are obliged to establish and
maintain a rapport with others because they
exist in the world of others and require their
love and respect. Third, it is absolutely necessary
that individuals recognize that they
are a part of the animal kingdom and are
governed by biological systems similar to
the ones that animate other creatures.
Fourth, there is a need for humans to relate
to something or somebody greater than
themselves. These four needs are dynamic
and interactive. Each may demand fulfillment
more strongly at one period of life
than at others. For example, the need to
learn about one's self is urgent during adolescence
as one's body quickly changes in
the service of developing organs of reproduction.
Although the need to relate to others
is a powerful force throughout life, it is
especially demanding during early adulthood,
when individuals prepare to assume
adult roles and to initiate intimate and,
hopefully, lifelong linkages with members of
the opposite or same gender. In many societies,
people seem to be more in touch with
their spiritual selves toward the end of their
lives than at other stages of their existence.


In general, everything that lives manifests
a predictable chronology of existence. It is
conceived, sprouts, bears fruit, shrivels up,
dies, and returns to nature to be recycled.
This sobering and inevitable cycle also
occurs with humans. The model intends to
suggest that human existence is a continuous
and changing movement. During youth,
human existence flows quickly and abundantly.
As people age, the flow of life
(genetic expression and life experiences)
slows, but the evaporation process continues
unabated until the tub of life is empty.
No one escapes from life alive, nor can its
flow be slowed or reversed. Considering
how our existence ends and evaporates
helps to emphasize how precious each
moment is.


<b>THE BALANCING
OF THE FOUR WORLDS</b>


In recognizing the four worlds of human
existence in this model, we outline the expansive
outlook of existential cross-cultural
counseling. The existential cross-cultural
counselor is a macroscopic and holistic
thinker who sees beyond superficial cultural
differences to find the imbalances
among the client's four worlds that produce
and maintain his or her emotional disturbances.
Viewed as an organic whole, the different
worlds are like the developing petals
of a flower. For a young sapling to bloom
fully, each petal must grow and integrate
into the single entity of the flower. As van
Deurzen-Smith (1988) applied this notion
to counseling,


It is not possible to work exclusively in one
[existential] sphere and neglect all the other
aspects. Though clients frequently emphasize
their struggle in one particular dimension,
it is usually essential to ensure that
difficulties in living get worked through on
all four dimensions. (p. 88)


Existential cross-cultural counseling recognizes
that life is an intricate balancing act.
The physical, public, private, and spiritual
worlds all require attending or else their neglect
will form a hungry vacuum that cries
out for emotional nourishment. Individuals
must learn how to balance and integrate the
various existential spheres of their lives so
as to achieve a meaningful synthesis. Due to
differing life circumstances, certain individuals
will find this task easier than will

[p. <i>376</i>]

However unequal our existence in the
four worlds, each of us inevitably moves
toward death in which all humans find their
ultimate equality. We cannot stop time; the
sifting of the hourglass grains is the most
rigid and unmerciful aspect of living. Yet,
this irrevocable movement enriches life and
reminds us of the short chronological
boundaries to our existence. Yalom (1980)
believed that the striving to transcend death
is the creative force behind our monuments,
inventions, books, artistic creations, and the
like, all of which are conceived to gain individual
immortality through the realm of
ideas or materials. Some persons, however,
become stuck in the past to distract themselves
from their movement toward death,
with the sad byproduct that this retrospective
existence hampers their creativity and
enjoyment of the present. It is easy to blame
the past for life's unhappiness; it is more difficult
to find the courage to move forward
and make the best use of the time remaining
within the four worlds of existence.


<b>THE CULTURES DEFINING US</b>


Existential cross-cultural counselors realize
that cultural groups cannot be understood
with fixed principles or stereotypes. Human
groups always are changing and possess
great diversity among members. Although
cultural differences can become sources of
cross-cultural misunderstanding, when one
scratches off the patina of culture from a
human, one finds at the core a humanness
that is universal. The existential cross-cultural
counselor approaches every culturally
different client as a unique human first
but uses some of the concepts listed in the
following subsections to help understand
the influence of culture in the client's life.
Each concept is briefly defined, and the
implications for existential cross-cultural
counseling are discussed.


<i><b>Acculturation</b></i>


<i>Acculturation</i> is the process of becoming
adapted to a new or different culture with
more or less advanced patterns. It usually
suggests that the new arrival or socially
excluded takes on the language, values, attitudes,
dress, and behavior of the host culture.
Becoming like the others also implies
duration, as Fischer (1965) pointed out.
That is, it takes people a while to adjust to a
new culture. Young people tend to acculturate
more quickly than do their older cultural
peers (Turner, 1986). The related concept,
<i>assimilation</i>, conjures up the image of
the human organism unconsciously absorbing
surrounding stimuli. Because culture is
cumulative, it seems tenable to conclude
that young people in a host culture or community
are apt to become more like the people
in that community more quickly than
are their older relatives who have been
socialized during their formative years in
their native cultures.


An obvious implication is that the more
clients are acculturated, the more counselors
can feel comfortable using theories and
techniques they use generally with American-born
clients. However, counselors are faced
with the problem of having to make a determination

[p. <i>377</i>]

<i><b>Collectivism Versus Individualism</b></i>


Collectivism and individualism are concepts
widely discussed and contrasted in
social science (Triandis, 1994). <i>Collectivism</i>
refers to social systems in which individuals
submit to the interest of the group, which
may be the family, ethnic leaders, community,
work colleagues, nation, or other
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_22686');">[note]</a><div id="_note_22686" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">affiliations</div>
that provide a sense of belonging for
the people. On the other hand, <i>individualism</i>
suggests societies in which the needs,
desires, and aspirations of individuals take
precedence over those of groups such as the
family, kinship clan, and community at
large. Although the concepts often are presented
as polarities, it probably is more correct
to view them as indicators of general
tendencies and inclinations that can coexist
in the same individuals depending on the
issues or circumstances (Carrithers, 1992;
Dube, 1988).


With the intense and constant movement
of people from one nation to another, it no
longer is tenable to hold to fixed views
regarding them. People who are individualistic
in one country often become
collectivistic in another country, and vice
versa, for various reasons. For example, in
developing countries where agriculture is
the primary means of subsistence, people
benefit from being neighborly. In capitalistic
societies where individuals often live and
work in impersonal environments, others
who do not contribute significantly to the
fulfillment of one's immediate needs are
seen as competitors rather than as compatriots
(Fischer, 1965). In collectivistic societies,
the heads of families assume a powerful and
respected role. In individualistic societies,
household heads exert much less influence
over family members, especially adults.
Existential cross-cultural counselors need to
ascertain the extent to which clients are
products of individualistic or collectivistic
socialization. It is a good practice to ask clients
whether there are people at home or
elsewhere who should be consulted regarding
the presenting problems and their solutions.
To enter into counseling without
respecting the heads of families may negatively
affect the outcomes of counseling.
Whatever recommendations are decided on
in counseling may be rejected by family
authority figures unless they are consulted
early in the counseling process.


<i><b>Cultural Intuition</b></i>


Cultural intuition is the immediate
knowledge, sensation, and rapport that
counselors often experience when they
relate to clients from their own cultures. It is
the empathy that people feel for cultural
peers. As a result, there is increased ability
to relate to clients and to determine the
nature of their presenting problems. This
concept should not be interpreted to mean
that counselors external to the native cultures
of their clients are unable to empathize

[p. <i>378</i>]

Although cultural intuition is a human
phenomenon, the uncanny ability to know
what another person thinks, wants, and
feels without knowing the origin of the
power is especially prevalent among homogeneous
groups unaffected by outside influences
(Moles, 1967). In such societies, each
person is a veritable template of the other.
Even so, cross-cultural counselors must
guard against countertransference or unconsciously
generalizing their own experiences
onto clients, who are in fact different
from them in many ways because they were
socialized in other families. People are alike
and different at the same time.


<i><b>Direct Versus Indirect Intervention</b></i>


In helping clients, counselors talk to them
face to face or interact with others on their
behalf. In the United States, counselors usually
talk directly with clients who have
problems, especially adult clients. On the
other hand, in many cultures external to the
American society, the head of the family
assumes responsibility for all problems in
the unit. If a family member has a problem,
then the head of the household consults the
helper on behalf of the entire family, not just
the person who is perceived to be the identified
patient. In collectivistic societies, individuals
do not have problems; rather, families
have problems, and this in turn reflects
negatively on the heads of families who feel
responsible for their entire units (Triandis,
1994; Vontress, 1991).


Indirectness seems to be more pronounced
in traditional collectivistic societies
than it is in their individualistic counterparts.
In West Africa, for example, parents
and other adults in extended families socialize
children by reciting fables, riddles, and
maxims designed to inculcate important lessons.
When the children become adults,
they are apt to consult traditional healers
who use the same indirect intervention
strategies to communicate suggested solutions
to problems that clients present
(Vontress, 1991). Indirect intervention
refers to counselors working through one
person to assist another person. It also refers
to indirectness in terms of the language and
techniques that counselors use to help their
clients. In general, American-born people
are apt to be up-front in communicating
with people. In counseling culturally different
clients, direct communication styles
might offend them.


<i><b>Historical Hostility</b></i>


People are cultural extensions of their
forebears (Fischer, 1965; Wade, 1993). Even
though much of the past no longer is a conscious
part of their present existence, it continues
to affect their relationships with others,
especially those whose ancestors were
participants in the earlier history. For example,
because of slavery, many African Americans
harbor unrecognized negative feelings
toward Euro-Americans (Vontress &amp; Epp,
1997). In a like manner, Native Americans

[p. <i>379</i>]

The phenomenon can be observed in
many parts of the world. In Africa, old ethnic
rivalries cause parts of the continent to
be drenched with blood and set in motion
the exodus of thousands of refugees fleeing
the murderous attacks of adversaries whose
hatred for them goes back many generations.
In Europe, the slaughter and displacement
of people in the former Yugoslavia is
another example of historical hostility being
vented against people long removed from
the events of the past that first triggered the
hostility. In the Middle East, old hostilities
continue to simmer and threaten to explode
at any time. Therapeutic phenomena such
as resistance, transference, and the reluctance
of clients to self-disclose often are
manifestations of events buried in the cultural
histories of counselors and clients.


<b><i>Holistic Versus Monistic Diagnoses</i></b>


Societies differ in terms of what people
perceive to be problems in life, their causes,
and who should be consulted to remedy
them (Fischer, 1965). In general, in modern
and technologically advanced societies,
human problems are categorized into four
groups: physical, psychological, social, and
spiritual. Each category has its own set of
specialists who are trained to relieve individuals
of their problems. In the United
States, individuals consult physicians for
biological problems; they consult counselors,
psychologists, and psychiatrists for psychological
concerns; they consult social
workers and related experts for social difficulties;
and they consult ministers, priests,
rabbis, and imams for spiritual guidance.


In traditional societies, humans and their
problems in living usually are understood
holistically. In West Africa, for example,
individuals seek the counsel of a single
healer for problems ranging from a broken
toe to perceived conflict with a deceased relative
(Vontress, 1991). They also consult the
healer when they are concerned about the
yield of their crops. Mainly animists, they
perceive problems in holistic terms. Everything
in their environment is related. To
understand problems presented by clients,
healers in traditional Africa seek to understand
their relationship with nature, other
people, themselves, and the spirits that they
consider important in the conduct of their
lives. American counselors who focus exclusively
on the psychological dimension of
their clients' lives must recognize that in
many cultures the social, physical, and spiritual
dimensions of people's lives are just as
important as the psychological ones. Therefore,
they are advised to search for ways in
which to explore these dimensions with clients
from holistic cultures.


<b><i>Personalism</i></b>


<i>Personalism</i> is a perspective on life that
maintains that the person is the center of
intrinsic value (Lavely, 1967). People are
more important than what they do to earn a
living or the material things they possess. In
general, collectivistic societies in which individuals
live interdependently in small communities
encourage the development of
reciprocal interpersonal alliances (Mounier,
1992). Neighbors inquire daily about the
well-being of families and the individuals in
them. Privacy is not a cherished value as it is
in industrialized urban societies. Individuals

[p. <i>380</i>]

As a cultural ingredient, personalism has
implications for counseling culturally different
clients. First, clients may annoy counselors
with personal questions that seem inappropriate.
For example, they might ask
counselors whether they are married,
whether they have children, or how old they
are. Such questions usually are signs of
respect. Clients want to indicate that they
value counselors as humans. Second,
personalism has implications for diagnosis.
Individuals are considered to be more than
sets of traits that can be inventoried and
added up. Each person is a dynamic presence
that responds to the same environments
differently at different times. Viewing
clients as a static sum-total of inventoried
traits and facts is apt to cause many culturally
different clients to resist taking tests and
accepting the results as indications of who
they are.


<b><i>Introspection and Self-Disclosure</i></b>


Introspection and self-disclosure are
closely related concepts. <i>Introspection</i>
refers to the self looking within to discover
and evaluate the content housed there. In
counseling, it is assumed that the content
and insights derived from introspection will
be shared with the counselor. The revealing
of the self to others so that they may know
that self is called <i>self-disclosure</i> (Chelune &amp;
Associates, 1979). Counselors need to recognize
that in many collectivistic societies,
people are socialized to submerge the self in
the interest of the group. In such cultures, it
might be considered impolite or unhealthy
to focus on the self; the person is a part of
the whole. On American college campuses,
international students from family-centered
societies often write their family names first
and their given names last on official documents.


However, there are other reasons why
some clients might not self-disclose. For
example, African American lower class
males resist revealing personal content
unless they perceive their audience to be persons
of goodwill. Although most of them
can introspect, what they discover about
themselves might be so painful that they do
not want to share it with anyone. Historical
hostility also can keep such clients from self-disclosing
with counselors whose ethnicity
symbolizes historical oppressors. In fact,
clients have been known to generalize the
hostility to African American counselors
whom they perceive to identify with Euro-Americans.


<b><i>Cultural Anxiety</i></b>


Life is a series of events taking place in
different venues populated by people and a
variety of natural and man-made objects. In
large measure, socialization of the young in
any culture is designed to teach individuals
to manage different problems, situations,
and expectations as they move through their
life spans. Because parts of the world differ
in terms of climate, soil, terrain, and foodstuff,
it is understandable that cultural
groups develop a variety of patterns of
behavior required for survival. Their survival
skills put them in good stead so long as
they remain in their native cultures. When
they travel to strange lands, however, they
are likely to experience uneasiness because
of their unfamiliarity with role behaviors in
the host cultures.


In coming to America, many individuals
from collectivistic societies characterized by
interdependence among family members are
overwhelmed by anxiety. Back home, relatives
validate their personalities and statuses

The symptoms of cultural anxiety often
are misdiagnosed because they are reported
as somatic in persons from nonpsychological
cultures. That is, individuals often
complain of headaches, eye strain, constipation,
inability to sleep, and other physical
problems. Although living far away from
their family members, they often communicate
with them by telephone. Counselors
who intervene to help them adjust to the
United States should ask them about the
advice they receive from their parents and
other significant adults back home, whom
their cultures recognize as the repositories
of appropriate advice. Such inquiries
enhance the rapport with clients and contribute
to the effectiveness of therapeutic
interventions with them.


Cultural anxiety approximates the <i>DSMIV</i>
diagnostic category of separation anxiety
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994).
It also resembles homesickness, which many
American college students experience.
However, it is a much more intense feeling
for individuals residing in a totally new culture
where most of the cues and responses
acquired during socialization back home
serve little purpose. To some degree, racial
and ethnic minority group members who
are citizens of the United States experience
cultural anxiety when they move from the
comfort and support of their communities
to mainstream cultural environments.
Those who have been socialized in integrated
settings prior to going away to college
usually fit in well on most campuses.


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR COUNSELING</b>


It is antitherapeutic to stereotype clients
who appear to represent national, cultural,
or racial groups. People with ancestral roots
in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the
Americas, and other parts of the world defy
the simple classifications that their superficial
racial characteristics would indicate.
Their forebears, in adjusting to the natural
and social requirements for living, evolved
behavioral differences to adapt to their
regions of the continent, but many of these
differences can be lost to subsequent generations
who are socialized differently. Differences
in socioeconomic status, religious
beliefs, and educational attainment further
confound the ability to stereotype ethnic
group members.


American racial and cultural minorities
also elude precise definition. For example,
wealthy Hispanics, regardless of their countries
of origin, are different from those from
rural villages in Central and South America.
Those who are of the third and fourth generations
should not be compared with people
who are recent immigrants. In the case
of Native Americans, it is unreasonable to
consider individuals from different tribes or
those who live in cities as similar to people
who still reside on reservations. In counseling
Asian Americans, it is important to recognize

[p. <i>382</i>]

<b><i>The Relationship</i></b>


Even though it is untenable to generalize
about group similarities and differences as
they relate to psychotherapeutic relationships,
it is useful to recognize that some
clients in all cultural groups respond to
counseling differently because of their
socialization. For many, the idea of introspecting
and self-disclosing is cause for high
anxiety. For others, historical hostility or
prejudice toward their counselors' cultural
or racial groups may impede the establishment
of effective rapport. Other clients
from countless backgrounds may expect
friendly, relaxed, and personal relationships
with their helpers, an expectation that
might be threatening to counselors who perceive
helping as a scientific enterprise
demanding a prescribed social distance
between interactants. Potential clients present
too many perceptions and expectations
of helpers to forewarn therapists of each
possible cultural pitfall. Instead of relying
blindly on therapeutic relationship prescriptions,
therapists should realize that the therapeutic
relationship, as modeled in Western
psychology textbooks, is imbued with cultural
assumptions that might need to be
altered creatively to serve culturally different
clients.


Throughout the history of counseling
psychology in the United States, authorities
have devoted more attention to the helping
relationship than to any other aspect of the
therapeutic enterprise. Some writers and
theorists have made the relationship the
essence of counseling itself. The emphasis
on the relationship has highlighted numerous
problems in cross-cultural counseling
because, in the United States, clients from
lower status racial, ethnic, socioeconomic,
and national backgrounds are unaccustomed
to relating to their higher status
counselors as equals. They often feel
uncomfortable in cross-cultural counseling
relationships because they believe that they
are being judged by people who are affluent,
more educated, and perhaps unfamiliar
with the moral compromises and complexities
of a less privileged existence.


In a few instances, culturally different clients
might desire unequal relationships with
their counselors owing to their cultural
belief that professionals are wiser and able
to provide accurate advice. Although professionals
do possess a wellspring of useful
information, and although clients may
accord them the deference of respected
elders or even gurus, it is important for
counselors, irrespective of their clients'
attributions, to maintain a posture of philosophical
equality with their clients. Culturally
different clients might wish to defer
to the opinions of their counselors, but there
is something detrimental to the human spirit
across cultures when counselors do all of the
thinking for their clients. Achieving some
degree of <i>individuation</i>—to borrow a term
from Jungian psychology—in personality
may be a universal developmental task that

[p. <i>383</i>]

The existential cross-cultural counseling
relationship strives to approach what Buber
(1970) called the "I-thou" rapport, that is, a
deep fellowship stressing honest sharing and
mutual regard. It would not be an overstatement
to characterize this relationship as one
that generates a platonic exchange of love
akin to what the Greeks called <i>agape-love</i>,
whereas Boss (1963) chose to label it
<i>psychotherapeutic eros</i> without intending
to imply the romantic element that the word
<i>eros</i> would suggest. Although underemphasized
in other counseling theories, existential
counseling sees the sharing and generation
of loving feelings as a powerful
therapeutic force essential to all significant
relationships, not simply therapeutic ones.
Satir (1988) expressed the value of love
most powerfully: "Without loving and
being loved, the human soul and spirit curdle
and die" (p. 141).


In the existential cross-cultural counseling
relationship, the counselor is not a blank
slate awaiting projection in the Freudian
schema. In fact, the therapist's interpretation
of transference is peripheral to this
encounter given that existential counseling
assumes that seeking a parental relationship
or friendship with a therapist is a natural
striving, disguising the very human desire
for connection, bonding, and love. To be
effective facilitators of such authentic relationships,
therapists must be truly willing to
help others as a calling and must be at peace
with themselves as imperfect and mortal
humans who can honestly draw on their
own experiences and frailties and be
unafraid to share these with their clients.


The existential cross-cultural counseling
relationship is spontaneous, unselfish, and
respectful, and it shows reverence for the client's
culture and uniqueness. Existential
cross-cultural counselors love their fellow
humans as they love themselves. They are
personalistic in the counseling relationship.
The person is more important than anything
else in life—role, status, class, money, or
attractiveness. They do not distance themselves
professionally from their clients.
Gross (1978) found that psychotherapeutic
closeness increases the likelihood of successful
counseling. In other words, it is important
that clients believe that their counselors
appreciate them deeply as fellow humans.


Existential cross-cultural counselors are
world citizens who commit themselves to
helping their fellow humans through life.
They do not allow cultural, national, or
racial ideologies or conflicts to loom large in
their encounters, for to do so is to encourage
cultural defensiveness on the part of their
clients. Although it is ironic in a profession
that prides itself on its caring and humanism,
Vontress noted how radical the notion
of a caring therapeutic relationship is to the
professional counseling community:
<cit>
<q>
</q></cit>

Over the years, my colleagues have come to
see me as an iconoclast because I reject the
notions of therapeutic objectivity and professional
distance and declare them to be
anti-therapeutic.... I believe that we must
genuinely care about our clients as fellow
human beings. I have come to despise the
professional games and bureaucracy that
we dispense as our means of helping others.
No wonder clients often come to hate
counseling centers; these organizations often
reflect the insensitivity of the clients'
world instead of offering a place of refuge
and healing, (quoted in Epp, 1998, p. 12)

[p. <i>384</i>]

<b><i>The Diagnosis</i></b>


There are several points that therapists
should keep in mind when diagnosing clients
external to the mainstream culture.
First, therapists should ascertain whether
assessment tools and procedures normally
used with dominant group clients are
appropriate for their culturally different
counterparts. Second, they should decide
whether to diagnose from an "emic" or
"etic" perspective or both. That is, should
the yardstick for "normal" be based on the
expectations of the individual's immediate
cultural group (emic) or on those of the
community at large, extending beyond the
client's racial or cultural neighborhood
(etic)? In most cases, people move through
several cultural layers in a single day. Therefore,
both the emic and etic perspectives
might need to be considered at the same
time. Even so, the focus of therapy always
depends on the nature of the presenting
problem. Third, therapists should determine
whether a purely psychological assessment
is sufficient or whether the diagnosis
should be based on social, physical, and
spiritual considerations as well. Each client
must be viewed individually, not in stereotypical
terms.


In choosing diagnoses, therapeutic professionals
need to recognize that life consists
of opposites and contradictions (Lowen,
1980). That is, to understand and appreciate
the negative, it is imperative to experience
the positive (Ricken, 1991). Humans
are a complex mixture of opposites—sanity
and neurosis, rationality and irrationality,
good and evil, aggression and compassion,
and so on. Due to life circumstances,
upbringing, and perhaps biology, some have
learned to keep these polarities tilted in the
positive direction, but it is a naïve conviction
that some live without pathology or
evil; all attempt to live managing their negative
polarities so that they do not hurt themselves
or others. In diagnosing presenting
problems and personalities of their clients,
counselors should resist temptations to classify
people and their struggles with the
human condition into simple categories of
praise and blame or health and sickness.


<b><i>The Intervention</i></b>


Historically, counseling psychology in
the United States has placed considerable
responsibility on clients to help themselves.
The imposition of counselors' own values
and expectations on clients has been discouraged.
Counselors are taught not to
think for clients but rather to help clients
think for themselves. However, expecting
helpers to solve their problems is normal for
people from collectivistic cultures in which
authority figures often directly influence the
lives of others. Therefore, it is understandable
if such people, on their arrival in this
country, anticipate the type of intervention
to which they have become accustomed.
Furthermore, culturally different people
may be more comfortable talking to counselors
if the clients can bring other family
members or friends with them to the consultations.
Counselors are advised to determine,
during their first interviews with clients,
what the clients expect from them in
terms of the outcomes and styles bf intervention.
Do clients prefer (a) to work things
out for themselves with a minimum of assistance
from counselors, (b) to work cooperatively
with counselors, or (c) to be authoritatively
directed by counselors in searching
for solutions to their presenting problems?


Existential cross-cultural counseling is a
voyage to self-discovery not only for clients
but also for their counselors, who invariably
see a little of themselves in each of their clients.
The main goal of therapeutic encounters
is to engage individuals in personal
struggles to confront the areas of "stuckness"
in their lives (Johnson, 1971). To

[p. <i>385</i>]

Perhaps the simplest way in which to
communicate the existential intervention
style is to refer to it as a Socratic dialogue.
As the reader may recall, the ancient Greek
philosopher Socrates had a knack for getting
individuals to discover themselves and
to live according to the content of their self-discoveries
(Wolff, 1976). He was convinced
that the surest way in which to attain
reliable knowledge was through the art of
disciplined conversation in which he acted
as an intellectual midwife (Stumpf, 1975).
He would confront people with various
points of view on topics under discussion
and try to bring into focus their strengths
and weaknesses. Out of this experience,
he hoped that individuals would develop
their own wisdom and resulting directions
in life, giving birth to new selves (Johnson,
1977). Socratic dialogues did not
always end in clear-cut answers for individuals
(Rychlak, 1979). Sometimes, the hard
questioning would trigger ideas in the
minds of students that would take time to
understand. This approach to knowledge of
self was called the <i>maieutic</i> or hatching
method.


In essence, existential cross-cultural
counselors, like Socrates, do not use a bag of
tricks to get their clients to explore their
existence. If they have a "technique," then it
is their focus on the unique existential struggle
of each client. As dialecticians, they look
for difficulties in impeding the unfolding or
becoming of individuals and help them to
discover the reasons for their stuckness
(Christian, 1977). There is no one way to
accomplish this task. How counselors do
their work depends on the uniqueness of the
interactants. Counselors must ask themselves
how they can know and enter the
worlds of their clients (May, 1967). Once
they are inside, the most important question
is what counselors should do next. The
answer to this self-inquiry resides in the
hearts and minds of counselors, not in a recipe
box of techniques. In an interview,
Vontress warned,
<cit>
<q>
</q></cit>

I do not know whether all counselors are
equipped to be existentialists, however
simple this philosophy may sound. Being
an intimate friend, in a therapeutic sense, is
emotionally draining for the counselor
while healing for the client. In my opinion,
counseling techniques ... are not for the
client's benefit but [rather] for the counselor's
[benefit]. They are a structure for
the therapeutic interview as well as the
filler, or white noise, to use when the counselor
is unsure of what to do. (quoted in
Epp, 1998, p. 6)


The central agent of healing in existential
cross-cultural counseling is the therapeutic
personality of the counselor (Frank, 1961),
who relates to the client as a fellow traveler.
In graduate schools, many counselors

<b>CONCLUSION</b>


Existential cross-cultural counseling is a
rich philosophical approach to psychotherapy
that shares many of the same tenets
with the world's major cultures and religions
as well as both Eastern and Western
philosophies. It is this fact that makes it a
universally applicable theory of counseling.
However, existentialism subtly challenges
the other counseling perspectives in its expansive
view of life through the four worlds
and through its belief that a narrow focus
on cognitions, feelings, or psychodynamics
in the therapeutic relationship addresses
only a narrow slice of existence. Ultimately,
the existential cross-cultural counselor wishes
to concertedly explore with the client all of
life; not simply the random issues that
emerge in session—the transient importance
of which might only fade into the background
of the larger scheme of life that went
unexplored.
