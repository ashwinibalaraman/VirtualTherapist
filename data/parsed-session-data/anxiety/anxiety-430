<font size="4"><b>Breathing Retraining</b></font>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE STRATEGY</b>


Breathing retraining, also referred to as <i>diaphragmatic
breathing</i> or <i>abdominal breathing</i>, is a successful
method used to reduce physiological arousal or anxiety.
When anxious, breathing tends to become shallow and
rapid. This breathing pattern can perpetuate or even
worsen the state of tension in the body by reducing the
amount of oxygen being supplied to the brain. In addition,
rapid, shallow breathing may result in hyperventilation,
which occurs when excess carbon dioxide is in
exhaled in relation to the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream.
People tend to hyperventilate when they are feeling
anxious or tense. However, hyperventilation itself
increases symptoms such as dizziness, increased heart
rate, and tingling sensations, which serve to further exacerbate
the anxiety. Breathing retraining can help reduce
physiological symptoms of anxiety by increasing the
oxygen supply to the brain and by triggering the
parasympathetic nervous system, which works to restore
the body to a calm, resting state. This technique is particularly
useful for people who suffer from panic attacks,
social anxiety, phobias, or other anxiety disorders.


<b>GUIDELINES FOR
IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY</b>


The first step in breathing retraining is to learn to distinguish
between shallow chest breathing and deep
abdominal breathing. One helpful way to identify such
difference is by placing one hand on the chest and the
other hand on the abdomen right beneath the rib cage.
First, one takes a normal chest breath by trying to make
the hand on the chest rise and fall while inhaling and
exhaling through the mouth. Once able to recognize the
sensations associated with shallow chest breathing, the
next step involves "retraining" the breathing process by
taking deeper abdominal breaths. This is done by inhaling
slowly through the nose. Attempt to minimize
the movement of the hand on the chest when inhaling
by forcing the air deeper into the abdomen, which will
cause the hand on your abdomen to rise. It is sometimes
helpful to imagine inflating a small set of lungs below
the rib cage. While exhaling, the client is asked to
breathe out slowly through the nose as the hand on the
abdomen falls back down to the resting position. Practice
sessions need last only approximately 5 minutes. Some
people find it helpful to count slowly to five while
inhaling and count backward to zero while exhaling.
Counting can serve to slow down the breathing rate,
which decreases the chances of hyperventilating. These
exercises are easiest to do while lying down at first.
After becoming comfortable with the exercises while
lying down, the client progresses to a standing position.
Ultimately, this technique can be successfully applied
while in a sitting position during daily activities (e.g.,
while driving, at work, in a meeting).
