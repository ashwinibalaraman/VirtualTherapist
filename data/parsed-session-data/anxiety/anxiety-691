Opening Commentary on the session:
<b>In this session, my interventions are largely unsuccessful. This happened because I wanted "A" to be at a place further along both developmentally and psychologically than she was. For most of the session, "A" externalized most of this session, that is she attributed the source of her distress as others' behavior, and was not able to reflect on her reaction to their actions, nor on her participation in the situations she presented. The ultimate goal in therapy is the help patients see their role in generating or sustaining their distress so that they don't put blame wholly on others. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_769');">[note]</a><div id="_note_769" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"></div></b><b>This doesn't mean, of course, that a patient shouldn't recognize when she was been abused or mistreated.</b>
In this session, I tried to pull "A" along to a more "psychologically mature" place, rather than meeting "A" where she was emotionally,. In retrospect, what may have been happening is was in psychoanalysis is called a parallel process. This is when the therapist treats the patient similarly  to how the patient treats someone in her life. In this session, "A" speaks about how her frustration that she can't get her boyfriend to behave and respond the way she wants him to. Similarly, I try to get "A" to respond a certain way and I don't adjust my interventions when they continue to be unsuccessful.
<b>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</b>
(00:05:37)
THERAPIST: Hi. Come on in. I saw I had a message. I was just making sure it wasn't you. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_1672');">[note]</a><div id="_note_1672" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" arrives 5 minutes later. Historically, psychoanalytic therapy focused on how the patient behaves toward the treatment. Coming late, missing sessions, arriving very early for sessions are considered to be meaningful, and reflect some part of the patient's conflicts. There are several theories on what lateness in particular can mean. Is there some immediate concern or feeling that the patient wants to avoid talking about? Was she unhappy with the previous session? Is she having feelings toward the therapist she can't express? These are questions that analytic therapists consider. Whether and how to bring address these with the patient is a matter of clinical judgement and tact.</b></div>
CLIENT: Okay. Feeling any better?
THERAPIST: Yeah. Much better thank you. It was just a cold.
CLIENT: So I don't think I mentioned about how Jamie and I fight when we talk about travel. So we planned a trip for the end of March, which led to a huge fight again last night. And he's looking for like perspective and he just becomes very, to me it seems, irrational. And then it's just downhill. And I end up feeling like I'm in a position more like ... like nothing that I'm going to do is going to please him for that moment because I don't know what he wants. So I tried asking like, "Seems like whatever I do, like nothings really making you happy at the moment like what you want." And he was like, "I don't know." So that was terribly frustrating. But it all starts with trying to plan a trip and we narrowed it down to a couple of different countries and he asked ... well he was like ... he always, "I want you to pick this." Because I feel like, not like it's a test, but he's traveled a lot and I've traveled less and he's always like, "It would be more fun if we could do things together." But then, I feel like I'm in a position where I'm in a position where I'm always being like tested.
(00:07:24)
CLIENT: And then when I like present things he's just like, "Well that's not ... like what do you mean you want to go to Panama? What do you want to do?" So then I'm like, "Okay." And end up feeling like I have to like build a case because I feel like a lot of times his stance is like disagreeable verses being agreeable (inaudible_00:07:43). So basically last night he was like, "Where are you thinking?" And so we had dropped Iceland and I was like, "Well after we do yours I would like to go. But not now I was really hoping on someplace warm." And so we talked about like Panama and Nicaragua and then ... it's just ... I don't know, negative. Like, "How are we going to meet? What are we going to do?" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_4356');">[note]</a><div id="_note_4356" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" begins the session by describing that she feels attacked. She says that she wants to appease her boyfriend but she can't figure out anyway to do this. I wonder if this feeling of being under siege, a truly unpleasant feeling she might wish to avoid, led her to arrive late. This is not something I would suggest at the moment but it's a way I'm listening to the material.</b></div> And I'm like, "Well if you can like calm down a second I can tell you." And he just starts saying things that don't make sense and I know it's like deep in the weeds and nitty-gritty but like stuff like that really sets me off. Cause when he's like, "How are we going to plan to meet in a foreign country like Central America is hard?" And I'm like, "Well all the flights fly through Tennessee so wouldn't that make it easier? If I'm stopping in Tennessee and you live there. We can just make sure we get on the same flight. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_5284');">[note]</a><div id="_note_5284" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Jamie is behaving in a way that is drawing "A" in. Rather than her saying, "it seems like you're very anxious right now, what are you anxious about?" she launches into defending herself. She gets drawn into it because one of her inner conflicts is between a hyper critical part of herself and a part of herself that tries to appease her inner critic. She cannot hear his anxiety because her conflicts are being stimulated.</b></div>
(00:08:31)
CLIENT: And then I feel like I get caught up in those little details that ... and then it was just one thing after another where he was like challenging me that I didn't do enough research on it before I tell him what I want to do. And then he's like, "That's besides the point." And I'm like, "What are you talking about? Because you're asking me what found. I'm telling you a little bit. You're telling me it's besides the point."
THERAPIST: You have no tolerance when people are childlike. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_6268');">[note]</a><div id="_note_6268" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This may not have been the most useful comment. I make it with "A"'s father in mind. How she is behaving with Jamie is remarkably similar to how she acts with her father. She describes her father as irrational, childlike, critical, unrelenting, etc. When Jamie exhibits some of these features, she is set off.</b></div>
CLIENT: No. (Chuckle)
THERAPIST: No tolerance what's so ever.
CLIENT: Cause I feel like I'm ... well I can definitely be irrational at times, but like logical. And then when he gets angry he doesn't want to talk on the phone. So this is happening through chat and I just feel like that's really child like. Because all these chats are like throwing back and forth and like you have to keep up with reading them and we're both angry. So we're like typing odd. I'm like, "Why don't you just call me and I can explain." And he's like, "No."
(00:09:32)
CLIENT: So then that pissed me off. But so then we end up booking the tickets, the airline tickets because it was like a really good price. And then after he's like, "Well I don't even know if I want to go. We have twenty-four hours to ..." I don't know. I don't even know where this went. But by the end of the conversation I felt like I didn't even want to speak. And I like got up to brush my teeth and then when I came back he's was offline and I haven't talked to him this morning. But I feel like we both just start pushing each other's buttons and I feel like I really try to be aware of like ... like what maybe sets him off? And I try not to do it, but I feel like when he starts doing it to me like I just ... I have no control (chuckle) I do it back.
THERAPIST: Yeah. What was ... I think it's less that what sets him off and more about what sets you off. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_8081');">[note]</a><div id="_note_8081" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I am trying to move her from focusing on his behavior to helping her be more reflective about her own feelings and behavior. Her next comment shows that she is not in a place to do this.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. And then what sets me off is when he's like, "You're not doing your research. You're not doing this or you're not inspired to travel." Why am I choosing a trip to go on and like researching if I'm not inspired to travel. And you can't have a discussion with him about those things, it becomes like terribly frustrating. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_8646');">[note]</a><div id="_note_8646" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>It would have been helpful for me to comment that she feels deeply misunderstood.  This, rather than my previous comment, may have helped her focus to her feelings and experience. Right now, she is externalizing the source of the problem. Her complaints are along the lines of "It's him, not me. He needs to change." When patients identify others as the source of their problems, they cannot grow.</b></div>
(00:10:46)
CLIENT: Usually he's pretty good about not being like an extremist. But like in those situations it's like either ... like I'm like, "I kind of like to travel. Maybe not to the extent that you do, but like I can still like it. I know that it excites me and I want to do it." But to him it's like, You live, eat, and breathe travel and research it twenty-four hours a day or you hate it. And then when I don't like meet that expectation I hate it and then him just saying that to me? Really irks me because I don't hate it. (chuckle)
THERAPIST: I'm sticking to my original thought. You don't have much tolerance when people are childlike. And clearly I have no idea what the thing is about travel for him, but clearly there's a lot of anxiety around it and when his anxiety is kind of immature you ...<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9912');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9912" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Typically, when the therapist has to reiterate her point, it's not a good intervention. If the patient can't use comments productively, it's better to let them go, and listen more attentively.</b></div>
CLIENT: Oh, yes.
THERAPIST: You want to rationalize him out of the immaturity.
(00:11:35)
CLIENT: Right. So how do you deal with someone who's ... so and normally I'm like ... I do think. Like I know that when he's under pressure, like the man just cracks. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10429');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10429" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>She says this with a critical tone. She's continuing on the theme of how bad he is behaving.</b></div> So I'm like ... first of all like we haven't traveled to a foreign country together. So I'm like, "Maybe we can find a place and maybe it's a little more safer or that speaks English." Because we're both not very strong in Spanish and maybe that will like relieve a little bit of the stress. So we brought up a couple of places and I don't want to go there, I don't want to go there. "Okay. You don't want to go there." But then I'm like ... <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_10991');">[note]</a><div id="_note_10991" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>A psychoanalytic therapist is always listening to the patient's communications on several different levels. One level is listening to what the patient says as a commentary on her experience in the current session. This is referred to as transference. The fact that she is talking about a place where they may not speak her langugage may, on an unconscious level, refer to how she feels she and I are speaking different languages. This hypothesis is based on the fact that she has not been able to use most of my interventions in this session. Perhaps she is saying, "you don't understand me and I don't understand you." We are not speaking the same language right now.</b></div>
THERAPIST: There's many wonderful English-speaking places that are not here but that's beside the point. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11802');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11802" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This may not have been beside the point. Unconsciously, I may have make this comment as a way of saying, "there are a lot of places that people have the opportunity to speak the same language," indicating that the therapy room can also be a place where we can find a common language.</b></div>
CLIENT: Well we knew that ... we looked at like Belize in particular because we wanted (giggle) to go like South or Central America.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm. But they speak ... a lot of the people in Belize are Guatemalan. You'd be okay with speaking English in Central America or whatever.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: That's not the point.
CLIENT: Right. And then I'm like, "We can get by." And he's like, "No we can't." So, okay.
(00:12:30)
CLIENT: And then I know we're coming from different places so I really try to pick a place where like some sort of common meeting ground.
THERAPIST: Oh my God going to Central America from Texas is so easy. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_12834');">[note]</a><div id="_note_12834" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>At the time, I didn't appreciate where my comments were coming from. In retrospect, I continued to address that understanding is "closer" than she might think. However, I don't think these were particularly helpful interventions.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. So ... and he's just saying like ... I mean it's just stupid and it's funny now. But like last night I was really fired up.
THERAPIST: What feels funny about it now? Because you're laughing now. You don't seem as angry.
CLIENT: Because it's like, like stupid stuff. Like why are we fighting over ...? Well I feel like it's almost funny ... I don't understand what his thought process is. And I know it's not my job to understand everything, but I can't like fathom in my head why he would say it's so difficult and then like backlash against that area of the world. Because it kind of like it feels like making up an excuse that it's hard to get too but I'm like, "It's not. And I already did the research." I feel like he has like a habit if like he doesn't want to do something he won't just say, "I don't want to do it." It's like little hits and drops of information and you kind of have to figure it out so that I end up wondering like to you even not want to go there? And if you don't why wouldn't you just say it? I don't know why it's funny now. I guess because I'm not dealing with him right now. (laugh) But it's just really frustrating. And then the whole thing is like, "Well ..." at the end of the we always end up saying like, "We're never doing this again. Go travel with your friends and I'll do it alone." And it's not what I want. I feel like both of us do want to travel and like why is it so difficult? And that's probably lately like the only time we really fight. Like I feel like we've worked on like many other things. I'm like overcome like a fair amount of obstacles and improved our communication. But when it comes to the subject of travel it's just like doomsday. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_14830');">[note]</a><div id="_note_14830" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Why is travel doomsday? Thinking about it on a metaphoric level, does travel mean movement or progress? Does it mean going to an emotional place she has never been  Psychoanalytic therapists are attuned to different levels of meaning, that people express many things in one thought, much of which they are unaware of. It's the job of the therapist to generate and hold onto these multiple layers of meaning and introduce them to the patient when the timing is right.</b></div>
(00:14:26)
CLIENT: And I feel like, I mean the option is don't do it, but it just feels weird like when we both want to do it but we can't like get our shit together and like do it together. Because its not like a matter of one person like not wanting to go and the other person, or one person not having an interest. But I guess in his head I don't have an interest. Now I feel like I'm rambling. But ...
THERAPIST: Really? How so?
CLIENT: Yes. I don't know. I feel like because it's like the same fight over and over with him. I'm like, "California or this or ..." Not mean, but it's just like the same things or he doesn't ... I don't know. He doesn't think that like I research things fast enough ... and then like some of it comes down to like he sits at his computer all day at work and just reads about things, like I can't do that.
(00:15:24)
CLIENT: So you know I research a little bit and I read what I can and ...
THERAPIST: Doesn't he have to treat patients? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16365');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16365" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm not sure where that comment came from but it wasn't particularly useful.</b></div>
CLIENT: He does. I don't know how he ... he's like superman. Like somehow he'll read like hundreds of studies, do procedures and still manage to surf the net all day long. And he's like one of the top like readers in his group too. So I don't know how he does it. Maybe he like truly is gifted where he's like way up here. (laugh) I don't know but it's frustrating to be like ... I do have this passion and I do, you know read about the countries and do the research and I don't know. I feel like part of it like bothers me a little bit that I feel like maybe like my aptitude isn't up to his. But he really doesn't ... like he's always like, "You're just as capable of doing all this stuff as me." And then that makes me more angry because like I know that I am, but to spite my ... like before I said my passion to do so ... I don't ... Those like extreme words just really get under my skin. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_17374');">[note]</a><div id="_note_17374" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Here "A" elaborates on why she feels she needs to please and appease her boyfriend–she feels inadequate compared to him and feels like she can never live up to his expectations. This would have been helpful for me to comment on.</b></div>
(00:16:32)
THERAPIST: Why?
CLIENT: Because I feel like they're not true statements. And then he like puts me in a bucket where I'm this or I'm this. And so it's like if I say that I like travel, it's not meeting up to his standards then ... I could say that I don't like it but that's not true. And then if I say that like I like it a little he just doesn't get ... there's no middle. He doesn't get it. So I almost feel like ... I like ... I don't know. Like forced to say that I don't like something when I do. And that's just, I don't know. Annoying. But yeah, I feel like the fight last like led to all sort of like nasty things. Like I ended up telling him to like go travel with one of his female friends and then I felt like took some like digs at her. Ended up not very productive. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18450');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18450" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>She continues on the theme of failing to meet his expectations. Her suggestion that he take a female friend on the trip speaks to her feelings of inadequacy, as if she's saying, "maybe you'd prefer another woman."</b></div>
THERAPIST: So well if he says things that aren't true, why does that matter? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18778');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18778" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This comment was way off, and potentially hurtful. I think I'm trying to help her not take his difficulties personally, to separate his issues from hers but in addition to being insensitive, I'm missing the most important point which is his comments resonate with her underlying fears.</b></div>
(00:17:33)
CLIENT: Because I feel like he's like, "You don't like to travel, so let's not do it." And then that ... I guess that kind of matters because then we don't ... I'm not doing some things that I want to do with him and I feel like its just not true. [starts crying.]
THERAPIST: So what's making you sad right now?
CLIENT: I have no idea. I don't know. I just feel like ... I feel like it's a big obstacle in our relationship. I feel like there's something that I want to do and I want to do with him and then his like solution is, "Well, like you don't like it. Clearly you don't like. So let's not do it." And then it's really annoying. (emotional) And so then, I don't know I feel like part of me is like, "Well screw it, like I'm going to go anyways." But then I feel like that really takes time ... time away from like us; he and I spending time together. (slightly crying) And like I don't want to do it with someone else. I want to do it with him.
(00:18:37)
CLIENT: And then I feel like once we're on the trip it's fine. It's the whole planning piece that like, it's just like no winning. Like I could give him a couple of ideas quickly and then if I don't have all of his answers then like I didn't research enough. And then I'm like, "Okay." Like if I like plan an itinerary maybe that will give him more structure and information. Then he complains that it takes too long. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20543');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20543" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" is moving between sadness and anger.

Like I gave you an idea and you want all this information. So then I try to give you information with that." And then you say that it takes too long. And it's like ... I don't know. I feel like it just really brings out the worse in us. So ... yeah. I don't know why I find it so upsetting or saddening. (sniffling)
(00:19:36)
CLIENT: But, yeah, like I feel like if ... you know like ... I feel like this should be like a happy, fun thing. Not ... I don't know, stressful or something that causes us to fight. So ... Yeah. And then I feel like, well, you know do we just like ... like kind of remove it, the stressor and not travel with each other? But I don't think that really solves the problem.
THERAPIST: Well any two people in an intimate relationship can be childlike at times. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_21782');">[note]</a><div id="_note_21782" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>When I work with couples, I provide a good deal of psychoeducation and this is one of the ideas I share with couples.</b></div>
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: And so that's not really an answer because the problem is for whatever reason this causes him a lot of anxiety and he sounds like he throws a temper tantrum. And you try to reason with him in these moments. You're very determined to reason with him, which makes him throw more of a temper tantrum because that's not where he's at, at the moment. You're missing him. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_22339');">[note]</a><div id="_note_22339" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>What I am trying to do with her is more advanced that where she is at the moment.

Trying to understand what goes on in the mind of another is an important part of having healthy relationships. "A" is not there yet so I am asking her to do something she can't yet do. What would have been more helpful is to talk to her about how desperately she wants to reason with Jamie. This is what is more emotionally salient at this point in the session.</b></div>
(00:20:48)
CLIENT: Mm-hm. Right. But ... yeah ... I like ... I'm like I just don't know like how to deal with it, because he's like asking questions; I'm answering them. Then he's like ...
THERAPIST: Right. But the problem is that you're answering them. I mean, he's anxious. Sounds like you're really anxious.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: This isn't going very well.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: We need to figure out what to do.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. I don't know ... And I know like that is like a trait with him like across all ... like even at his job if he has a good or bad day or like ... I've seen him in like the same situation with like friends traveling. It's like you have to like talk him off a ledge to like ... and it's obviously easier like when I'm not the party he's having the conflict with, but ...
THERAPIST: So he uses this across all travel plans with all people?
CLIENT: Travel ... even just work. He doesn't have conflict with people but like he'll get like really stressed out and then it's almost like he's like irrational. Like he had a performance feedback and he thought it was bad feedback but it was just like what I thought, especially from like managing people, it was just like a small constructive area of focus. And then I said, "Like you're never going to get a review where you never have anything to work on. Everyone has something to work on." He was like freaking out and then he decides to come to Providence for a couple of conferences this week and that didn't work because he didn't think he was going to make partner and he started to like looking for other jobs and like we really feel like talking but, "I'm sure it's going to be okay. Like it's a very small thing. Like if you were like making mistakes, like that would be much worse. It was a bedside manner type thing. So he, he does have that type of personality that I'm usually good with consoling him and helping with other people. But when I'm involved I can't deal with it or then I end up like in this like fight or flight. I'm constantly like fighting to like prove that I do have a passion to travel or prove that I did take a look at the flights and see how we could meet up or ...
(00:23:02)
CLIENT: And then I think it's like the tone of it too. Its never like, like excited. Like, "Oh. Like so what did you find?" It's just like, "I bet you didn't do this." Like, "Actually, I did." And then like he's like, "Well ..." For example, you know, "Do we even Visa to go to the country?" " No we don't." " Did you even check?" " Yes I checked. Why would I say I didn't?" Like I guess those things really annoy me. And then I feel like its almost like no ... I don't know, like no trust almost. Like he can't trust me to ... I don't know look at something or complete a task. So you want to have this sort of like oversight. But then you tell me that like you get annoyed with me because I don't run with it.
THERAPIST: What about his bedside manner? Did he get the (inaudible_00:23:49)?
CLIENT: He doesn't work well with like the techs and he like, he doesn't know how say anything nice or he's kind of like demanding and so he'll just be like, you know, "Set the table or why didn't you do this or ? Instead of being like, "It maybe helpful if you can prep this (inaudible_00:24:08)." And so ... and then I guess he like didn't ... he didn't connect well with the patient and the patient complained and I think it was partially his fault in how he handled the situation. Because something happened where the referring doctor had like a miscommunication with him and something ... he wasn't like ready for the procedure. I don't really know what the procedure was exactly but ... it was kind of like how he handled the situation when the patient was complaining that caused the patient to complain about him. So this came off but ...
(00:24:44)
CLIENT: Yeah. He doesn't know how to say things like in a nice way. It becomes very like accusatory. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_27101');">[note]</a><div id="_note_27101" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is important information that she has not mentioned before about her boyfriend. "A" takes her boyfriend's attitude toward her personally whereas he seems to behave this way toward many people in his life. It highlights how unrealistic "A"'s attempts to "reason" with him is, and to  make him recognize how critically he is treating. Treating people this way seems to be part of his personality which he can't simply be talked out of.  Also of note is how similarly she portrays Jamie and her father. This speaks to the psychoanalytic idea that we tend to seek out partners who remind us of our parents, especially the parent with whom we've had the most trouble. The idea is that by seeking out a partner who reminds us of a problematic parent, we are trying to fix that parent and undo the pain that relationship created for us. For "A" this would be, "if only I can make Jamie less critical and more reasonable, I can undo all the suffering I endured from my father's criticism, unfairness and irrationality". This is an unconscious, rather than an intentional, wish/ behavior. This also speaks to why mourning is a central concept in psychoanalysis. If a person is able to mourn the kind of parent she didn't have, she no longer needs to seek our relationships to right the wrongs of childhood.</b></div>
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And that's just really ... and then the way I react to that is like starting to prove why I like I can do it or I did do this research or I do know this and I was thinking it's probably not good in the moment. But I feel like ...
THERAPIST: Well you feel like he's talking to you and he's not.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: This is ... you're not really talking ... he's not evaluating your skills and then giving you feedback on it. He's just kind of ... it sounds like he's just sprays in the air, his anxiety and whoever ends up getting hit by it, so be it. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_29064');">[note]</a><div id="_note_29064" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Again, I'm trying to help her see his vulnerabilities but this is not something she can use at the moment.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. But I'm like if he's like ... like when he's like asking, well then like he's never a rash person and last night he was like, "Why didn't you book it now?" Like Now. I'm like, "Okay. Well like are you sure you want to go here because you, you know you generally research and normally you want to do all of those things. And he's like freaking about the prices dropping then he was like, "You don't care like if you waste money." And I'm like, "Well that's not the case" But I'm also not going to like commit to something if I don't know if I want to do it, I mean ... So then we like discuss the flights, the times, the seats, we pick out where we're going to go and then I had an airline gift card from my mom. So I had to like find the confirmation number and put it into the website so I could get the credits. And he was like, "Did you book it? Are you booking now?" I'm like, "Mm-hm. Wait a minute I had to login." " Are you booking now?" " Yup. Wait a minute I'm putting in the gift card." And he's just like, "You're being so slow." And then I was just like, "Can you shut-up for one second because I'm trying to do this? Can you give me five minutes, please?" And it's funny, but it's not funny because like I think things like that are funny. But he's not. Like he's really upset at that time.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:26:54)
CLIENT: And I just ... I don't know how that I could ... and then a couple times I'm like, you know, "Can you just calm down for a minute?" Like we're kind of losing track of the conversation and that doesn't work. But I don't know what works.
THERAPIST: You describe him exactly like your father. I'm not saying he is like your father. But you describe him exactly ... you just switch the names, it would be the same. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_31014');">[note]</a><div id="_note_31014" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I am careful to say that she "experiences" them similarly, not that they are similar.

(Chuckle)
CLIENT: Right. So ...
THERAPIST: He so rationally expects this but then he expects the opposite of this at the same time and it really doesn't make any sense. And then he wants this and then he says this to this people. But if you say this to this people is it obvious how they're going to react? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_31569');">[note]</a><div id="_note_31569" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>As a way of reaching her, I spoke from within her perspective, using her intonation as well, which allows her to hear herself in a different way (see below)</b></div>.
CLIENT: (Laughter) So ... that doesn't sound good. (Laugh)
THERAPIST: What part of it?
CLIENT: Because I feel like I really don't like my dad. (Laughter) No. I like him, but ...
THERAPIST: You love your dad.
CLIENT: I feel like I don't respect him for many reasons. I guess those reasons that I agree are (inaudible_00:28:02) but maybe their rational or irrational tendencies maybe similar. But yeah. I'm like, I don't ... like the only thing I can think to do at that moment is just not speak. Like finish ...
THERAPIST: Well because it riles you up.
CLIENT: Right. And then I feel like whatever I say, I don't know, will ... at that moment the only thing I can think to say is like, you know, "I do know this about the country or ..." Because I feel like he's, I don't know, he's asking these questions and then I end up answering them. But then he comes back with like, "That's not even what I wanted." Then I try like the, "What do you want?" and he doesn't know.
(00:28:50
THERAPIST: You have a hard time excepting at the moment that he's having his temper tantrum and that probably you need to leave him be or the two of you need to leave each other be. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_33004');">[note]</a><div id="_note_33004" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I missed an opportunity to follow up on her comment about not knowing what Jamie (or her father) wants.

CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: You don't want ... you want to talk him out of it.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: Have you ever seen a kid have a temper tantrum?
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: Have you ever tried to talk him out of the tantrum?
CLIENT: (Laughter) No. So ... yeah.
THERAPIST: Can you put your words ... can you put your feeling into words right now?
CLIENT: (Laughter)
THERAPIST: And I'm not saying that Jamie is an infantile person. But everybody has infantile parts of themselves and some have more than others. And some have just different ways of expressing it.
CLIENT: Right. Yeah. It's just ... I don't know. I feel like there's just ... if we fought about like other things and I felt like they made more sense. Like money, how often we see each other, I don't know. But I feel like travel, which is supposed to be like a pleasurable thing, should be pleasurable.
THERAPIST: Some people don't do well out of their routine and comfort zone. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_34374');">[note]</a><div id="_note_34374" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This was also a multi-layered comment as I think in retrospect I was also referring to "A".</b></div>
(00:30:01)
CLIENT: I don't know if he's just really high strung, I don't know ... he's high strung but ... He like, thinking back when we left Arizona, we were going though, we had to take like, you know a shuttle from where we dropped the car off, we get on the plane and we've never flown together before. And he was just like, rush, rush, rush. And then he was like complaining about how many things I had in my hand and I mean, we like bickered and you know it was funny we were laughing by the time we were through security, but I was like, "Why do you care how many things I have in my hand? Like just go. Like I don't pack my coat in my suitcase like you. There's no room for it, get over it." And then he's like, "Why do you have your phone in your hand? Put it in your pocket. We're trying to go through ..." I mean, just shut-up, like ... and it's not like I was delaying things. I don't know. And then I feel like this is really like an extra rational side because why does Jamie get mad? It's not like I was holding up line. Why does it bother him that I held my coat and phone? But ... I don't know ... it's just in these travel type situations this just comes out and it really is like the demise of us.
THERAPIST: I mean, I would think that there is something that you ... that keeps ... I mean I'm curious about what keeps you engaged, because you know very quickly what isn't working and you keep doing it.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: And so, I'm wondering like if there is a way in which there's something that feels not necessarily good about it, but something that's in it for you too and being engaged in this way. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_36177');">[note]</a><div id="_note_36177" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>Again, somewhat futility, I try to have her step out of being the victim of Jamie's irrational behavior and encourage her to reflect on her role in it.</b></div>
CLIENT: Well I think when we're on the trip we have a really good time. It's getting there that's the huge problem. So I mean at the end of the day we are on a trip and we're having a goodtime. We're seeing someplace new and I feel like that's, you know the good part of it. But the planning piece is rough.
(00:32:09)
CLIENT: And ... yeah. So I don't know what keeps me engaged. I think every time when I'm like, "That's it. I'm done. We're not traveling anymore. And then I think I can't do this with you." And then I feel sad. And then I don't know if that's the piece that you know that makes it worth it. But I feel like it's so stressful like at times like I feel like that could really be like the demise of our relationship because it's something like I want to do with my partner and experience with and it's something that he says that he wants to do with them. And that's like we've discussed that, you know we don't want kids. We don't want these things but like that kinds of like, you know one thing that I think is like good for us and to do together. So if can't do that together then I don't know, what do we ... not what do we have to do? But I don't know. I don't know then I think it like brings up like all sorts of other feelings like ... and I know he's like irrational about like what I want you to take what I say seriously or why ... I don't know why do you dealt with it like I couldn't ... look on a stupid website and find out if like we need a VISA or not. Or ... but I think like if he's going to act like that ... and he doesn't act ... really travel is probably the only time like when I say with the two of us. But it's just like if he's going to act like that all the time like it's going to be a losing battle, constantly.
(00:33:33)
THERAPIST: Well, you take what he's saying personally the way you take what your dad says personally.
CLIENT: And I take what he says much more personally.
THERAPIST: Jamie?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't know about that.
CLIENT: (Laughter) No?
THERAPIST: Why do you think that?
CLIENT: I feel like my dad like really gets under my skin. And a lot of times I feel like because I'm ... well, I says that I don't care, but it upsets me. But I feel I don't care almost. Like when Jamie says things like I feel like, like maybe whatever my dad says like impacts me like many layers in. But like what Jamie says just like zaps me. (Chuckle)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: Yeah. And then ...
THERAPIST: Well when I made the ... when I've made the points about you're not having tolerance to his irrationality, you then go on to really point out quite just how irrational he can be.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: You've already convinced me of that.
CLIENT: Right. (Laugh)
THERAPIST: But it's like you're saying, "Yeah. But he's really, really, really irrational."
CLIENT: Yes. (Laugh) If I'm open.
THERAPIST: Almost as if you say, "How else could I do this because he is so, so, so irrational?" <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_39518');">[note]</a><div id="_note_39518" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm pointing out how victimized she feels by his irrationality. She's externalized the problem such that the only solution is for him to change.</b></div>
CLIENT: Yeah. Well, yeah. I feel like ... well what I'm dealing with, with my dad, like a lot of times I just like walk away and I don't care. And then with him it's like I really do care and I don't know, like part of me is really trying to help him, like you feel really stressed out and I did look at some things that can make it easier for us. And it's like he's not open to that and then ... not that I feel my effort is wasted but, you know. I guess like I feel like a little annoyed and then ... I don't know if sad is a good word but like I put in this time and effort to try to, you know maybe make the trip a little bit easier as far as like getting up and ...
(00:35:33)
CLIENT: And then he's so like irrational like he doesn't recognize it and then he complains that maybe it will be difficult to meet up. So I don't ... and so I just don't know how to like respond because like they're reasoning doesn't work and the kind of like maybe you should calm down. Maybe calm down and reconvene doesn't really work, so. And then not talking on the phone, I feel like, I don't know. I feel like that's having like a heated debate through IM is not very productive. So ...
THERAPIST: Well productivity, none of this is productive.
CLIENT: It's not, I mean I feel like we're just ... like you can't say you don't know what word was a reaction or something else. It just makes it very difficult. It's just like when you're angry, like you read fast and then you miss words and like read them in a different way too. But, you know I just feel like it's ... I don't know how too appease him in those situations.
THERAPIST: Yeah. You're really looking to appease him. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_41417');">[note]</a><div id="_note_41417" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm again trying to draw her attention to her experience but she quickly goes back to Jamie's flaws.</b></div>
CLIENT: So, yeah. I don't know. And like he gets so hyped up, like he's like he wants these answers and he wants to get it all figured out now. And like a lot of times with him like it comes down to money, like he's really, I guess this bothers me a little bit. He's very frugal, just fine. But sometimes I feel like you don't need to be so frugal at like the expense of like and every persons feelings or <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_41961');">[note]</a><div id="_note_41961" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>At this point, I could have made a comment like, "you feel he's also frugal emotionally". I think this would capture her experience while at the same time moving her away from the concrete and toward an awareness of her feelings.</b></div>... I don't know because feel like a lot of his stress was coming from money too. The plane ticket was going to go up and he was going to have to pay an extra whatever how much it was going to cost. And it's like, I don't know, it's okay nobody really wants to, to waste money. But it's like he causes his own stress because in his head he was like, "Do I make a decision now?" And he doesn't know if he's ready to do or do I pay more for the ticket? I don't know how that goes until I deal with him, but. Sometimes I feel like, "Let's take a moment apart." Doesn't necessarily work because he wants to get it resolved right then.
(Pause)
CLIENT: I just feel it's very ... like we talked before, look I don't like to be in the state of like discomfort or ... so I don't know if I find things like this just like extra ... being in a place of discomfort really bothers me or ... but I don't like when we fight like this.
THERAPIST: Well it seems like at these moments you feel like the only way that you can be less upset is if he gets less upset. But he's not getting less upset. He's getting more upset. And you try to help him be less upset so that you can be less upset. But you're being ... you're trying to make him less upset is making you more and more and more upset. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_43523');">[note]</a><div id="_note_43523" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm highlighting how dependent her emotional state is on his.</b></div>
(00:38:51)
CLIENT: Right. So how ... like how do I ... I guess I just never know what to do because I'm like trying to help to make him less upset and it's making him more upset. It's making me more upset. And then the, like the taking a break doesn't work. The giving him the information he wants doesn't work. And then sometimes I think like does he get annoyed with me because he doesn't ... I know he's throwing a tantrum because he may not be getting what he wants, but does he really have like an issue with me? Because he's wants me to do something kind of like we've talked about like with my dad and like I'm not that ... I'm never going to think like him or do something like him which is fine, but can he not deal with that? Like is he always annoyed because what if I give him is not like what he would do himself. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_44459');">[note]</a><div id="_note_44459" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" expressed that fear that not only does she not feel she can please Jamie, she thinks that he expects her to be like him. She feels he won't tolerate her being her own person.</b></div>
(00:39:53)
THERAPIST: Right. That's when you're taking things personally.
CLIENT: Right. And that's how I end up feeling because it's like he expects ... like ... I mean ...
THERAPIST: Let me add something. He doesn't know what he expects. He's regressed. He doesn't have any expectations, he's regressed. The only thing that you can know is that whatever you give him isn't going to be right. That's a place, you can start from there. But you don't start from there. You start ... it's like the kid is having a temper tantrum and you're shaking a rattle and you're giving him a toy car and you're giving him the bottle and you're doing all this stuff and this kid is just screaming. But you think, "Oh if I just figure out the right toy everything is going to be okay."
CLIENT: Right. So what do you do with the kid with a temper tantrum?
THERAPIST: You go into the other room and let it play itself out. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_45631');">[note]</a><div id="_note_45631" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>A better comment would have been not to take the temper tantrum personally.</b></div>
CLIENT: (Laughs)
THERAPIST: What you're saying is that he has a temper tantrum anytime the issue of travel comes up so it's unclear what do because you want to travel.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: I don't know what the right solution is, but I can certainly tell you what are the wrong solutions.
CLIENT: Giving the answers?
THERAPIST: Well, yeah. You're engaging ... you're really wanting him to be rational. You're not in a sense giving him the luxury of being irrational and I can see why he ... I'm not justifying his behavior. I'm not saying this should be fun for you and you're not, you know? I'm just saying like you're asking, you're like, "I want help with this situation?" So you know in this sense I guess I'm saying if you really want to make it good for yourself you need to be that quote, unquoted bigger person. That his temper tantrums are (inaudible_00:41:26) for whatever reason. And it's hard for you to accept how irrational he can be. And he sounds like he doesn't know what he wants. I mean, I'm being metaphoric and again I'm not trying to put him down. I think we all have these parts of ourselves and it sounds like his are very concentrated around, you know particular issues and you know, he's not thinking. He doesn't know what he wants. He's just anxious. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_47077');">[note]</a><div id="_note_47077" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>I'm wanting her to have a larger perspective on what is happening between her and her boyfriend.

CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you're trying to reason with him. I could see why it irritates him because he's trying to be irrational and you're telling him he has to be rational. That's when you start getting into a conflict.

THERAPIST: Maybe. I mean you have a hard time talking to him as an irrational person.
CLIENT: Right.
(00:42:26)
(Pause)
CLIENT: So yeah. If after the fact if you can talk about it and have maybe a productive, good conversation, yeah. I definitely think like I like ... I don't know, like I push and then I want to reason and I don't know how to walk away from that. Or if I do like I feel like it's not ... I don't know, it ends up being like in a negative way. It always makes things worse. Like it's kind of like not so much like, "Why don't you think about this and we'll talk about it?" Like I get so annoyed that I'm just like, "Look, I'm done, goodbye." And then I leave.
THERAPIST: You don't want to like allow ... you don't want to sort of let someone be irrational.
CLIENT: Yeah. I don't know why. I feel like I don't ... well I think I can be irrational, but ... I feel like a lot of times ...
THERAPIST: Well you don't have any tolerance for your own irrationality either. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_49387');">[note]</a><div id="_note_49387" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>This is an attempt at a different avenue to help her be more reflective of herself.</b></div>
CLIENT: Right. And I think that's what bothers me because like I, I'm sure there are times when I don't identify. I mean, like a lot of times like I quickly identify and then I feel annoyed with myself that I've been irrational. And so I don't know how to build that tolerance there. Or wanting to learn to like walk away for a little bit. But not in an irrational way. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_49878');">[note]</a><div id="_note_49878" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>The intervention helps her to think more about herself.</b></div>
THERAPIST: Walk away without stomping away.
CLIENT: Right.
(00:44:08)
CLIENT: And then when it comes back to like the fairness, because like I just don't have the tolerance and when it's going on I just think its almost unfair that they're being so rational and then I get annoyed and then it's like I want to stomp away. Maybe that's when my irrational side comes out. Because I don't know.... I think consciously like I don't want to be nice to you because you're being irrational. But I think part of its like I'm so frustrated and like, "I just can't deal with this." I don't know like stomp away.  <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_50604');">[note]</a><div id="_note_50604" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><b>"A" continues to be more self-reflective, bringing in the issue of fairness and how important fairness is to her.

THERAPIST: Yeah. I know you feel really unsettled. It's like he's having a temper tantrum and that that's to get the temper tantrum in you.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: And you're both having a temper tantrum.
CLIENT: Right. In that I could see it like first, I thought, "Okay he's starting to freak out." And I try to be like, "You know this could be a lot easier than you think."

She's essentially saying, "just snap out of it." Probably one of the reason her boyfriend reacts so negatively is that she acts dismissively toward his feelings.
