REVISITING. We turn to the past. Three weeks ago Ginny
called to tell me she had suddenly decided to go home for Christmas,
since Karl and all of her friends were leaving and she couldn't bear
the thought of being here alone. As she described her visit East, it
sounded like a journey into guilt. She introduced it by saying that
she should have stayed longer, that she was there only thirteen
days, that she hadn't been fair to her mother or her father, that she
spent only three days with them and the rest of the time with her
friends and she hadn't been sensitive enough to her parents' needs.
On Christmas day Mother had picked up and gone to the beach for
three hours by herself because she was upset. Ginny came down,
asked her father where Mother was, and said, "What's the matter
with Mother--is she crazy, going out to the beach today?" Immediately
Ginny's sister bombed her for her thoughtlessness in saying such
a thing.


In a period of five to ten minutes, as Ginny was describing her
home, I suddenly had an entirely new perspective on the making
of Ginny. In so many ways I envisioned her mother as a guilt-inducing
machine. When I expressed some of these thoughts to
Ginny, which I did fairly openly, Ginny quickly rushed to her
mother's defense: for example, Mother had gone to the beach "to
experience some of her more stormy emotions." She then tried to shift
the onus of blame to her domineering and matriarchal grandmother.
I agreed that it wasn't her mother's intention to create guilt,
but, nevertheless, that's what happened. Ginny continued by considering
how awful it is for her mother because her two daughters are
leaving her. I suggested that a mother's job is to prepare her children
to be able to leave home, but Ginny brushed this aside almost
impatiently.


Then she talked (in my language) about her inability to differentiate
her ego boundaries from those of her mother. She said
that her psychotherapist in New York was always shocked that she
and her mother would use the bathroom at the same time. She
wanted Mother to see her bras, she wanted to show her figure to

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so we talked about these things, though I suspect without
much benefit for Ginny. (I persisted because it was illuminating
to me; I gained a much clearer view of Ginny within her family
context.) She wants so much for things to be different, had such
hopes of going home and really breaking through. But what does she
really want? She wants to return to a warm, loving idyllic childhood
that never in fact existed. Or, at least I think it never existed. It's
remarkable how little Ginny and I have talked about her childhood.
I'm very wary of getting sucked into a Proustian recircling of the
past. Stay in the future with Ginny. She'll have a different past soon.
She told me a dream, prefacing it and concluding it at least a half
dozen times with the commentary that it was a silly dream that didn't
mean anything. Naturally I see this as secondary revision and can
only conclude that the dream was in fact very important. The
dream was that I was having dinner with a number of gurus, who
were obviously incompetent, and yet I was saying that they were
O.K. The dream was unsettling because in it she said she ought to
have someone new to work with. However, in her waking state she
knew this wasn't so and thus decided to hide the dream from me, lest
I take it seriously. Her associations to this were newspaper articles she
had read about me (which had misquoted me somewhat), in which I
criticized Esalen and other kinds of encounter groups, especially an
encounter group leader who led a group that she had been in.


She talked about her new job as a traffic guard. She finds it very
humiliating and then joked with me saying that I thought I was
working with a writer and now I'm working with a policewoman. I
became very uncomfortable at that and felt that I was in a sense,
at least in her mind, doing the same thing her mother had been
doing, making great demands on her for production, and she sensed
that she had to be a writer and produce for me rather than for herself.
I said as much to her, but with little effect. No doubt there is more
than a little truth therein. I do want Ginny to be able to write. And

IF I WERE accused of a crime I would be my own best witness.
Whenever I talk about people I love, I always make them seem
guilty and I do this with a smile. Because if I'm guilty, they're
guilty, guiltier in your eyes. I was giving you information, though
I don't know why, because you're not going to make any evaluation
or come up with an answer or plan. Anything good that
happens in this therapy happens simultaneously.


I knew I was giving you ammunition against my parents. That
made me feel worse. Especially since that day I was mailing a
letter to them--"Dear Mommy and Daddy" and giving them lots
of real love. I feel if you talk to someone else about people,
you are betraying them. I probably betray myself most of all since
I am always telling things about myself.


During the session though I didn't feel bad. I was much too
hot--I felt like I was in leggings, a bundled up baby--and maybe
I should have said something. But then I adapted myself to the
heat, and the heat was a cozy pastime. I am a lazy boy fishing
off a bank. If I put the right kind of mother bait on, you will
always bite.


No, I know what you were trying to do. To tell me to believe
in what I say. To accept the limitations and faults of my parents.
But every time I do think about those things, I seem to

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have told them almost everything in my life. But my life is
not there, in all those facts and stories. It still feels buried. The
only vital agitation I have with these facts is dreams. And then
my parents and I are much more active and ghastly.


Comfort I have been trying to get is by digging down, burrowing
back to the nest, surrounding myself with calm. I really think
I must be still burrowed in the cave, like Plato's cave, since I
write and think only with analogies. Everything is like something
else. Even this write-up is so veiled, it is not direct. Maybe
you wouldn't understand it. Here's another translation. "Yeck!"
That's how my mouth and eyes and face and mind feel after I
have revelled (pun--I meant to say but misspelled "revealed")
just enough to keep me floundering but not drowning.

A RATHER distant hour. I felt distant from Ginny and think she
probably felt distant, though not so much as I. In fact, it is only with
considerable effort that I can bring myself to dictate this. There was
a five-minute lag between the first and second sentence. She started
off by saying she has been outside herself the past few days, and feels
nervous and tense. I couldn't find any convenient way of involving
her or involving myself in what was going on. I tried to get into last
week, but she remembered very little from that session. She then
talked about her feeling that she doesn't change. She gets to a certain
point in her sexual relations with Karl but can't go any further. She's
done the same in therapy with me. I tried to pry up some examples
of changes that she has made, in fact, even suggested that we get out
one of the old tape recordings we made a couple of years ago. She
wasn't too happy about that and managed to come up with a few

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Following this she returned to her relationship with Karl. Her
current plight is that she is merely marking time, waiting around to
be told when it will all be over. A few days ago he gave up his
business and took another job. She knows this change means something
and what it may mean is that he will begin saving money to go
to Mexico and then she will, one day, learn from him whether or not
he intends to take her with him. If not, the relationship is over. I was
rather overwhelmed with the helplessness she expressed. At the same
time I realized that she takes pride in her helpless tragic pose. I even
tried to bait her by referring to her as the little match girl, and then
followed quickly with the suggestion that she decide, adult-like, what
she wants from the relationship. Is there no decision she has to
make? Is there anything in the relationship that might make her
move to terminate it? For example, if Karl refused to support her, or
if he would never permit her to have children. It was very difficult
to prod her into saying that she could make a decision. In fact, it's
even impossible for her to ask Karl whether he intends to take her to
Mexico; she feels she has to wait in silence until he tells her. I
ended up the session rather despairing and baffled about how I could
infuse her with any respect for her own rights. At one point she
said she tried to ask me a couple of weeks ago about my vacation and
she couldn't pull it off; it would be the same thing with Karl. I suggested
she try again with me. Could she now ask about my vacation
or about anything else? She asked how I felt the sessions were going,
but since it was already after the hour was over, we passively
agreed to pick up from there next time.

AT THE END of the session, things began when you asked me to
ask you a question. It's kind of like kids miming throwing

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And with Karl I try to be all good, simultaneously storing my
mistakes in my brain. With you I try to be all bad. I say all the
worst things about my situation. And neither way is realistic. I
realized that last week.


I would like to flow with my moods and take from you. But
instead, before I come in, I have a theme song--"I am nervous."
And the overture keeps playing until in the last minute when the
curtain's about to come up with your line, "Ask me a question,"
I notice that it's intermission for another week.


I go outside and make the air smell like popcorn for me. And
I think I'm hungry and this at least is a real sensation, so I go
buy a lunch with black and white soda, with expectation stretching
back to when I was five years old, and a hamburger, and
when I don't enjoy either, I am still paying $1.79. It strikes me
like a wave--that here I am paying this money for this crap,
and I have just not given you anything. (I don't mean money
which I don't want to pay. I mean real feelings.)


Probably the horrible things I say in session make me feel
guilty. You were right about word magic. Although when you said
it, I thought you meant all the bad metaphors I used to cover
up real statements.


This whole write-up for sessions is word magic which I hide.
Which I wouldn't want anyone to see.


But the biggest magic that has ever entered my life is not
words but real emotions and actions, like tears and thrashings.
I get lost talking. I have no subtext.

I have been able to appreciate the good things that happen
to me.

A RATHER important meeting. I had the feeling, it may be an
illusionary one, that we broke new ground today. But then I think
of the old story back at Johns Hopkins of the patients who would
come in for years and almost every week the chart would say--
patient better, patient better--and then at the end of several years,
one sees that there really has been no change. Nevertheless, even
taking this into consideration, somehow I feel that we moved into
new and fertile territory today.


Things started with Ginny complaining of a very severe migraine
headache. I uged her to see an internist, whereupon she quickly
changed the subject and launched into a discussion she had had with
a good friend, which merely reinforced some things we had talked
about at our last meeting: namely, that this friend and her husband
would like Ginny to visit them sometimes alone, the reason being
that nobody sees much of Ginny when Karl is around. She gives
herself up when he is present, becoming little more than a mute and
featureless shadow. In the midst of this I tried to state very clearly,
and more than once, that I thought the relationship with Karl was a
limited one in which she was not herself, and, what's more, that
changing might not be a way of losing the relationship but strengthening
it, since I suspect that Karl, or any man, would relate more to
a full woman. I also mentioned the opposite possibility; it may be
that Karl has a good deal invested in her being just the way she is
and any change would drive him away, in which case, I said, I'm not
sure that would be particularly calamitous, since an involvement with
a person who doesn't let one grow is hardly a healthy situation for
either party.


She went on then to engage in some more self-derogatory sentiments.

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She blocked for awhile. Then I began to prod her for her feelings
toward me. She stated that she hardly ever writes about me in the
post meeting write-ups, and she knows she never presents me to her
friends as a real person, in fact pretends to have little allegiance to
me. She added that her friends are curious about me, for example,
they want to know my age. I asked her what she told them and she
said "thirty-eight," and I said that was very close, that I was thirty-nine.
She admitted having cleverly manipulated me into telling her
my age without asking me directly. We went back to last week, when
at the end of the hour I suggested she ask me something and I asked
her again to do so. Then she asked how I really felt about the hours,
were they O.K.? I told her that she could probably find out a lot
more when she reads what I've written; basically I had mixed
feelings--occasionally I felt impatient or pessimistic and often I felt
good about them. She wondered how she would feel later about my
saying that I was pessimistic or discouraged. I pointed out that I don't
often have that feeling, and that I felt reluctant about saying that
openly to her because she always presents herself as such a fragile
flower, that I am afraid such a comment would leave her crushed
and defenseless.


I asked her what else she wanted to ask me, and then she asked
whether or not I thought of her between the sessions. I tried to rephrase
that by asking if she meant whether or not I care about her.
That was difficult for both of us for awhile, and she seemed on the
verge of tears. Abruptly she said she doesn't really care if I care
about her "in that way," but then she started to cry and confessed
that she thinks about me, about parts of my body and my hair, and
wondered how she's allowed me to become such an important part of
her life. Also we got into a discussion of the fact that she can't really
get well because if she gets well, she'll lose me, for it is unlikely that
we shall continue our relationship as two equal adults. At the same
time, however, she wants me to treat her like an adult, and I said to
her, fearing very much that I was being a scolding parent, that to

OH GOD. Yesterday's session was the first that I began to feel my
own methods. And why I defeat myself. I play the children's
game that says "take five steps," but unless I say "may I?" I
get put back or put myself back. After the session in little ways
I tested my power. And that kind of extended the session further.
For instance, at night when Karl wanted to read instead of going
to bed, although not coming right out with it, I did tell him that
there was something between reading and deep sleep.


In that one bramble bush toward the end where I said "I don't
want you to like me like that but (big pause) to care for me,"
I started half crying. It was more like I cried because here I was
back to my old cliché, "Do you like me, care for me?" I start
to cry and get ashamed because I have travelled so little. Like
a child who says "ma ma" up to five years old, crying in frustration
because though he means "ma ma" he means a whole
lot more.


When I was home I saw how my parents must have done
everything for me when I was young. Comforting me even before
I needed it, feeding me, buying me wonderful things. So somehow
I feel like I've never made a needy gesture. Everything was
just all around me in abundance. And that's the way I place
myself around other people now--like a delicious fruit bowl
waiting at a table, and the fruit already a little spoiled.


As with everything I seem to have gotten stuck on the sentence,
"I need," or "Do you like me?" Three years ago that was revolutionary

What follows close behind me is my catatonic shadow that
convinces me


I do not move.


I do not stagger on.


I don't progress.


I only pose, a model for my shadow,
a shadow for my silhouette.

A RATHER unsatisfying feel for this hour. I think I've been too
intrusive in forcing my values upon Ginny. I was too authoritarian
today, too directive, and engaged in too much exhorting and preaching.
But it was hard for me to do anything else. She began the hour
by talking about her many fantasies of leaving Karl and somehow
starting life anew. Over and over again, when I hear these fantasies,
I can only think that there is obviously a strong part of her
that wants to leave him, that is highly dissatisfied with the relationship,
or that perceives the relationship as a stifling one. Then she
described an incident in which Karl suggested to her that she share
the gasoline money with him. He is now earning approximately $90
a week, she only $30. She does the cooking, grocery shopping, and
the cleaning, and though she feels it's unfair for her to have to pay
gasoline money as well, she made only a feeble protest to his request
and ended up by consenting.


I tried to make her see that giving in to something she considers
unfair stems from a refusal to recognize her own rights. I feel that in
the long run this is self-destructive; she's almost insuring that Karl,
if he's a well-integrated person, will soon tire of their relationship. If,
on the other hand, he's the kind of person who really needs such a

Unfortunately, however, the treatment hour took on the aura of a
pep talk, in which I was urging her to do things she may not be
ready to do; yet somehow I want to impart to her the knowledge and
the feeling that is really her responsibility to change her life. It
may be that Karl is such a limited person that they will break up,
and I guess I feel in the long run that's just as well. On the other
hand, I could imagine that Karl or any man would be really impressed
at her gradually growing up and becoming a "mensch"
and if that's too much for him to handle, so be it. I'm sure Ginny
in the long run will find plenty of other men who can appreciate
her as a more integrated person.

IT'S HARD for me to remember what happened. It all seemed
pretty direct and straightforward (a cliché, that sentence like
"How are you?"). When I go in to the session like that--full of
grievances that have been aching all day--I feel like I have a
deficiency, like a vitamin one, and you have to supply the
stuff that gets my complaints out, that stops the cracked record
from repeating.


I think you probably got to see more of me as others see me,
or as I function, in that session. I don't really try to interact

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the first time in therapy you didn't side with me--you
know how you said, "Well any man would leave a woman who
only showed the surface." I liked that.


I think Karl really is a good strong person. And he is only
stingy because he is not in love. If he did love me, things would
come naturally--the gasoline would flow without me having to
make a federal case out of it. I guess I am really hurt because
in putting down petty rules for Karl and me, I know I am asking
them to take the place of love and generosity.


When I finally told Karl, it was anti-dramatic. He said he didn't
like the martyr quality in me. "Behind every martyr is a shrew."
He says he only wants to be told things and that's true. When I
tell him something immediately, he's very pliable, acquiesces,
doesn't put up a fight, provided my voice comes out deep and
resonant. However, as soon as I delay the emotion, and then
replay it, if he detects the slightest screechy timbre to my voice,
he turns on me, and whatever point I've won, I've also lost.


And the dialogue never got as deep as I had planned. But it
was still better to get it out.

I HAD a patient immediately after Ginny and some unusual scheduling
difficulties which didn't permit me to dictate a note on her. Now
it's been several days and the interview has begun to blur in my mind.
The most striking thing was that she came in and immediately
said, "Well, don't you want to hear what happened?" and then went
on to tell me that she had talked to Karl about the things we had

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At some point in the interview I wondered what she wanted to
work on next. She talked about making love and wanting to be able
to ask for things for herself. I wondered what she wanted to be able
to ask for. What Ginny said then was so benign that she couldn't
help laughing at herself: she merely wanted to ask Karl to do something
a little longer because it felt good. I asked her to say this aloud
a couple of times, so that she could take some distance from it and
see the absurdity of her inability to say this, and she could not repeat
her statement without mimicking herself or saying it with a
funny accent.


She also expressed the feeling that what she has with Karl is very
precious and I am going to take it away from her somehow. When
she was lying in his arms in the morning, she realized how much
this means to her and that nothing else is really as important. Ginny
also felt rather proud of herself because she had had a migraine the
night before, hadn't taken any strong drug for it, and somehow
managed to triumph over the headache without being all drugged up
today.


It's remarkable how four days later I can't go back and really
recapture what my feelings were to her during the hour. They all
blur into a generalized good feeling, and I know that she was happy
and bouncy during the session. Of course, I always like to see her
like that. Now I do remember that we talked about how young she
felt. She does manifest herself to me often like a very young girl. I
also remember that, as usual, she shouldered all the blame for
therapy sessions which she considers unsatisfactory. Obviously
there must be times when she is dissatisfied with what I give her,
and she rather tenuously got into the area by admitting she sometimes
wishes I could show her more of myself. I asked her what kinds
of things she wanted to know, but we didn't get very far with
that question.

WHEN I came yesterday I was expecting a surprise. Something
that would make the session a little different. An emotional
assignment. The expectation of going cured a migraine. My
fantasy and release kept step with my walking as I rounded the
long path to the hospital. I am always "cured" and jubilant on
the walk in, and feel about as heavy as a piece of duck down.


I say things in therapy that are not true. Even as I'm saying
them, I know I don't believe them, that they will confuse you.
Like when I said, "you're sitting across from me and seeing
nothing." Many times you've told me you don't think of me as
nothing. If only I could catch myself when I'm saying things like
that, contradict myself, say "No that's not what I mean," maybe
then I could take myself seriously when I speak. I don't fight
for my words. They just come. That's why I tend to disbelieve
them. And you diminish in my eyes when I see you going after
my words too seriously--some of my words.


You said one thing yesterday that I had never thought of before
and therefore came as a revelation--that if I am so scared to
say "such benign things, they must be substitutes for angrier
things hiding." I don't know if they are angrier things or just
stronger things. Like not saying "I love you" to K, when I sometimes
feel it.


Anyway all the energy I have, even yesterday, seems to be
wasted on observation. And yet it's not observation of a present
moment, but big memory observation, years of experience that I
can tally with one sarcasm. And when good things come up they
hardly penetrate my way of looking. I am what I see, not what
others see in me, but what I see. I feel very removed. Maybe
that's why I can't get close to you with words. Cause I can't get
close enough to myself with words. If these write-ups were
intellectual, that'd be one thing. But I don't even think in them.

Lately you've been putting slight pressure on me to do things.
Like thinking about the gasoline. I appreciate this. Because every
small thing I do gives me more to work with, more exposure, and
disappointment, cause it is still one removed, not originating
with me. Coming from you.

THE MEETING started off in black despair. Ginny said she had
been up almost all night, because of a terribly upsetting incident
which centered around Karl's saying to her that she was, in effect,
"a sexual lump." I remember Nietzsche's statement that the very first
time you meet someone you know all about him, and from that point
on you gradually erase these correct impressions. My first response to
her description of the incident was that it corroborated my first impressions
of Karl; it was a horridly callous remark and should have
called forth some anger in Ginny. She went on describing it in
some detail, I got sucked up into her pathos, and considered with
her ways to break through the impasse that had developed between
them. It seems that she had, earlier in the evening, perhaps unwittingly
rejected his advances, and thus felt responsible for his reaction
and, in fact, totally accepted his definition of her as a lump.
She began feeling like a lump in all aspects of her being despite the
fact that Ginny is anything but a lump. She is alive, imaginative,
deeply creative, and very bouncy. Indeed, earlier that day she had
gotten dressed in some outlandish spoof costume just to amuse Karl
and later had gotten into a long giggling spree in a German class
they had attended together. All this stands out in marked contrast
to seeing herself as a lump.


All I could do at this point was to question her willingness to
accept another person's definition of her. She lives in constant terror

Gradually, however, I returned to my feelings about her anger. In
her fantasies during that night she once again imagined leaving
Karl and even committing suicide. In a dream she and Karl were
being pursued, and Karl was killed. I commented that, although she
claims to feel no anger toward Karl, she killed him off in the dream.
She pointed out that they were together and that she begged for his
life to be spared, but I think that was irrelevant. The important
thing is that she expresses some of her anger in her fantasies and
dreams, but is absolutely unable to do so consciously. As we talked,
she remembered a fleeting feeling, a whispered hope that Karl might
apologize to her in the morning, and I tried to make her recognize
that hidden part of herself which felt offended and expected an
apology. But there was no way in which I could help her overtly
experience any of her anger toward Karl, even in play acting. As a
rehearsal exercise, I suggested she try to express some of her disappointment
with me. This was quite hard for her to do. We ended the
hour with her feeling that she had failed once again. I tried to
reassure her with the explanation that we had gotten into a really
crucial area for her--one which we'll have to work on for a long
period of time: her inability to express any anger, or aggression, and
her inability to assert herself and demand her rights all fit together
in this gestalt. What stops her from feeling anger, let alone expressing
it, is something we haven't even begun to explore. I've got a
hunch she has a brimming, but hidden reservoir of anger, but is
fearful of tapping it lest she be unable to turn off the spigot. At one
point I even taunted her with the question, "Could it be that sweet
little Ginny wants to murder somebody?" But I got no response.

DURING the session, a part of me was really getting excited, but
it was surrounded by the therapy character who sits on the
leather chair and listens and thinks "maybe." And on cue concludes
tamely that nothing really happened, though there is still
a possibility.


When you kept wanting me to go after anger and I couldn't,
I felt miserable inside but I also felt "very adult" sitting there
on the outside. It was almost like you were interviewing the
parent and the child.


I would listen to the little thing inside and then I would tell
you about it once removed. Inside I was boundless, saying things
like--"Fuck you. Fuck him. Fuck him." But it would just sit
there. Never really talking itself because if it would, it couldn't
use the same kinds of words I do or the dubbed conversational
tone.


I pose as heavier and "stronger" and "more conventional"
than the small anger or sadness inside. Which would dribble out,
wet my eyes, be mostly incoherent, attack the things that go
round in my memory. It's like when you say, "Maybe Ginny's so
angry she wants to kill." I agree with you--we're like two women
at a park and one has the child on a leash and there are so
many things--swings, jungle jims--the child could get into, and
we discuss abstractly those things. I feel a slight tugging on the
leash, like a man who goes fishing to sleep on the shore with the
sun and some beer. He feels a pull, smiles, dozes and lets the fish
nibble and go. I always feel the little pull in our sessions.


Sometimes, like that night before, I feel desperate and tired.
But I never really catch what has been biting and gnawing at
the line. I just get calm again and it is gone, the terrifying
feelings, the helplessness.


You gave me a great deal of hope and confidence when you
said that you had started to see me and my problems more

A WORKDAY, bread and butter session. Ginny started by telling
me that she had been thinking about the content of our last meeting,
especially about her inability to express anger, which she recognizes
as very true indeed. Not only is she unable to voice her
anger, but she is terribly uncomfortable around other people who
can and do. She then described a conversation with Karl following
our last session, in which he, as he often does, asked her what we
talked about, and wondered whether it had been about the previous
night. This surprised me somewhat because it seems as though Karl
is much more closely attuned to their relationship than she sometimes
implies. He was giving her a perfect opportunity to talk about her
anguish, which she did to some extent, saying that she didn't like
being called a lump, but he pointed out that when he said this, she
didn't do anything--just lay there and became even more like a lump.
This, to me, tended to confirm what I've been suggesting to Ginny
for some time--that her fear of expressing anger because it might
endanger her relationship with Karl (or someone else) does in fact
bring about the very thing she dreads, i.e., a stunted or severely
damaged human relationship. By not giving vent to her anger and
other profound emotions, by remaining a one-dimensional person,
she prevents people from relating to her with the kind of depth
and egalitarianism she would prefer. If Karl leaves her, it will not
be because she has driven him away with her anger, but with her
lack of anger. I wondered whether she has always been like that.
Ginny said "yes" and gave a couple of examples when she did express
some anger but shook with terror during the act. She pointed

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I said that perhaps one of the things she could do would be to
start talking about her feelings toward me, which might be easier
than with Karl. She nodded, as though that were very logical, but
when I asked her to talk about some of the things that she disliked
most in me, it was extraordinarily difficult for her to say anything,
although we've been through this several times already. The
criticisms she selected were thinly veiled virtues. For example, one
of my problems is patience; I am too patient with her. Most of the
things she said were based on the premise of my omniscience. She
stated that I really knew everything that was going on but there were
times in the therapy group when she wished I had acted in such a
way as to satisfy the needs of certain members, even though that
may not have been what they needed in the long run. I pointed out
that she attributed more omniscience to me than I possessed and that
there were times, in fact, when I really didn't know what the hell
was going on with some of the group members or with Ginny, for
that matter. She reacted as though that were really news to her.


Next she mentioned a couple of other things; she wished that I
could reveal more of my feelings, that I could show more annoyance
with her, but she's not sure whether I wouldn't just be like her
mother at that point. She talked again about how upset she feels
when Karl is not sleeping because she thinks he is contemplating
leaving her. I felt frustrated, caught again in a vicious circle, and
could only comment that her worrying about Karl's leaving her
causes her to be tense and anxious, which in turn will promote the
very thing she fears. I wondered whether the same pattern occurred
in her conversations with me: that she was so worried about my
leaving her that she has to be careful about what she says. She denied
that, but later asked, in a whisper, what was going to happen to
our sessions after the summer. I pretended that I didn't hear her so
as to make her phrase the question a little more clearly; in other words
what I wanted her to do was get some experience in asking a straight-forward
question, which is entirely her right to ask. So what she did
was to ask me, "Will you continue seeing me after June?" I answered
that I would. I asked whether there was anything else she wanted to
ask me and she said "no." She talked about the lack of personal
feeling she's had toward me, unlike her strong interest in other people

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Somehow we began to speak again of her sexual feelings toward
Karl and her inability to initiate any sexual activity, although Karl
had recently "given her permission" to make sexual demands on him.
She talked about her sexual tensions during the day and her ability
to deal with them rather quickly by masturbation, since I had assured
her it was okay. It seems as though my attempts to take some
of her guilt and anxiety out of the masturbatory act were successful.


I had planned to see her next week, even though I couldn't make
it on our normal Wednesday, but as she wasn't necessarily expecting
it and had made some other plans, I finally decided that, since next
week is so hectic, we'll skip the session.

GINNY


OF COURSE I have waited too long to write this. (It's Monday
morning, nearly a week gone by.) I remember we talked about
honesty, anger, speaking up.


The next night Karl was restless which was a contagious condition.
I couldn't calm him or sleep myself. The anxiety and
sense that I should be doing something was too much to allow
for sleep.


So while I hear things in therapy, and am kind of buoyed up
by the hope it gives me, when the time comes for applying
them, I stay with my old patterns. They are already there, in
remote control.


When you asked me to tell you my bad feelings and opinions
of you, I sort of did it more intellectually than emotionally.


I know all the ways to describe my fiascoes. Describing anything
else would be a new experience.


While I appear to go about with a selfless face, I am really
more selfish than Karl. I don't even think that what I am doing

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I will try to do better in the therapy reports. I think the reason
they are so hard is that I'm not on multi-levels (fear is the great
leveler) so that when I comment on things in the reports, I think
they must be obvious or already said.

WE DID NOT meet last week. Ginny started off the session by
saying that she had spent last Wednesday (our usual meeting day)
with friends. Her friend, who had just finished a long workshop
for changing her own behavior, spent about five hours working on
Ginny. Ginny felt she was being strangled by this girl. I felt that
she was implying that she had already been strangled by me. We
returned to familiar ground, i.e., Ginny's inability to express anger.
It's becoming clearer and clearer, I think, to Ginny and to me that
this seems to be a major conflict area. It's also becoming clear that
whenever she gets close to expressing any anger she bursts into tears.
She's done this on several occasions during the week. I told her
that I thought her behavior was perfectly explicable if we accepted
the assumption that she is harboring a murderous degree of rage and
has to be terribly careful not to let any of it leak out. This didn't
seem to mean much to her but she started to talk a bit about

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At this point she said she feels guilty about the lousy write-ups
she's been handing in to me. I told her if she really wants to stop
feeling guilty, she should write better reports. She knows this, of
course, but really wants to hear me punish her for it. I wondered
about the subterranean world she says she writes in; what does she
hear? What happens there? What does she not say in my office? She
went on talking about her sexual feelings, that she felt somewhat
sexually stimulated coming in here now and it was a kind of a different
feeling than usual, an adult sexual feeling. Somehow it involved
me but she couldn't quite bring herself to say so, nor could
she admit having any sexual fantasies about me, since that embarrasses
her so much. I imagine it is awfully unfair for me to expect
her to talk about her sexual fantasies toward me when I would not
be willing to talk about my sexual fantasies toward her. In fact, I
don't have any overt sexual fantasies about her, but I can easily push
myself into feeling quite pleasant about touching Ginny or holding
Ginny, although I guess the professional role is so deeply ingrained
in me that I have difficulty extending the fantasy to sexual intercourse
with her. However, I think that part of the shame she feels
results from the inequality of a relationship, where I'm expecting
her to talk about fantasies, yet not sharing in them; so in a sense
the shame is to be expected and I was being unfair in urging her to
talk about them. Ginny keeps insinuating that somehow or other I
should be pressing her harder, that I should do something more
dramatic. Sometimes I get the notion that a really good therapist
would, at this point, tell Ginny she has three months to make some
change or end therapy; I wonder whether it's because I like Ginny

I HAVE an impression that I talked a lot. I came in with a wild
nervous energy. In my dreams I had been a loved woman having
affairs, and this made me happy, satisfied and aggressive as
soon as I got up. When you were five minutes late for the session,
I started to get angry, because I wanted to see you, didn't
want to be sent home. And I fantasized that you had left for
lunch partially forgetting me, and later leaving word for me to
come back tomorrow. And I said (knowing I shouldn't be angry
since you were doing me the favor and not vice versa) to forget
it, that I would just come the next week. See I'm getting emotions
but they're all evolving from fantasies or turning into
fantasies.


Anyway I'm glad I at least talked in your office. A lot of times
you say "I don't follow you," and usually those times are when
I'm not making real sense--bull shitting, and reminiscing, using
my fantasies as the experience. Like when I said I felt like a
forty-five year old woman, and that everything was over for me.


When I told you about Eve's coaching me on bringing out
more of my feelings and self in conversation rather than just
relying on impressions and punch lines, I didn't equal the feelings
that I had had that day. (You see I thought that the closed
trap I was in was just with you, that with you and sometimes Karl
I withheld things. But then I found I was doing it with my best
friend too and being put down for it.) I couldn't recapture for you
the anxiety it gave me. But maybe that is my mistake in therapy
--to think that I must produce everything I've experienced or
feel I should have experienced. To keep going over experiences

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That first time I ever spoke to you, three years ago, was the
perfect time. (I was ripe from intense therapy and awakening.)
All my emotions since then seem to be dwindling away from
that vibrant moment, when I felt I spoke to you in truth and
vulnerability. After being mirrored <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_53973');">[note]</a><div id="_note_53973" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗ Literally, before a glass curtain with an audience of doctors.</div> in group therapy for two
years, I'm always self-conscious in there with you now. I have an
image of me, rather <i>than just experiencing myself</i>. I feel generally
stagnant, all damned up. Whenever I say something it is
usually very premeditated or fluff. Either way I feel I am not
digging down into any new sources. I don't surprise myself most
times and I'm sure I don't surprise you. This makes me angry
at you, but angrier at me. I'm the one who has blocked up the
current, only allowing a small seepage of feeling to escape. And
when it does, I stare at it till it dries up or you do. I don't
know what has made me so self-conscious. Maybe part of it is
seeing myself through Karl's strong severe eyes.


I'm released from this self-consciousness--when I'm having
fun with Karl or friends or you ask a question that is right. When
I become involved and am not worrying about every response and
what I must do. Then I miss a lot, but I feel more and usually
have less memory. I get off clean. The moment and experiences
seem finally over, without any bad echoes.


In therapy I can't marvel at your reactions to my controlled
givings. I don't give you a live person to work with. At least this
is the way I perceive it today. Even when I feel other things,
this other critical image of myself is superimposed and locked
in place. When I'm as nervous as I was today, it's like a television
picture jumping up and down. It's the same old soap opera
but it wouldn't stand still.


Maybe that fantasy about making love <i>and talking</i> at the same
time is a fantasy about therapy too. That you would talk me
into giving way, freeing my feelings, giving liberty to other feelings
besides defeat. Usually when you say, "What do you feel for

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I seem to be more on my guard in therapy than anywhere else.
Even though I know it would make you happy for me to act a
little different. I don't.


Part of the defeat I feel is being able to deceive you and
not get booed. I acted on the stage and somehow my face and
body are superficially there whenever I want them. They put in
an appearance, they understudy for emotion and strength. This
gives me no good feelings though. However after therapy I am
usually more able to act out my aggressions which are a retaliation
against my posing.

I HAVE NOT seen Ginny for three weeks. The last two weeks I
have been in Boston. The week before that I was supposed to meet
Ginny at 11:00 and catch a 2:00 o'clock plane to the East Coast. I
planned to do this until Tuesday when I really began to see that it
was impossible for me to get everything done in time to catch that
last flight out for Boston. I worked all day Tuesday and late into
Tuesday evening and finally after a great deal of hesitation I decided
that I had to call Ginny up Tuesday night and cancel the
appointment. I still gave her the option on the phone of letting her
know that if it were an absolute emergency, I would still try to
swing some time to see her. Her response at that point on the phone
was that it was too bad she wasn't going to meet with me because
she had a good report to give me. I felt badly at missing this,
frankly because I was curious to see what had happened, but at any

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Essentially what Ginny told me was that for a couple of days she
had felt extremely well--that it seemed to have begun perhaps on
Sunday evening with Karl again calling her a lump, accusing her of
going right to sleep every night and not really caring for him, and
she apparently retorted directly, returning anger for anger. The following
morning she was able to be angry at a schoolboy who had
been disobedient and taunted her on her job. No matter that she
scolded the wrong boy, she was still able to find the right one and
scold him, and no matter that he still didn't pay any attention to her.
She began to feel very strong and potent and take herself very seriously.
It sounds as if Ginny had a glimpse of her inner strength and
form, and then suddenly my cancelling the interview took everything
away from her. She said that she had a feeling that somehow she
was going to be able to come in and get some renewal from me that
would keep the current going and that my going away in a sense
put an end to the circuit. She couldn't fully express these things to
me on the phone because when I called she was just a couple of
feet away from Karl with whom she was playing liar dice. This
placed her in a rather difficult position between the two men in her
life, and she whispered into the phone that she couldn't really share
these recent changes with Karl because they wouldn't make any
sense for him.


All of this was said in a rather brilliant fashion. Ginny was quite
perky and even though she talked about this good feeling as belonging
to the past, it seemed to me as if it were at least partially
still present. I had a lot of thoughts about what she said and tried
to explore them all systematically.


First, I wondered about the annoyance she must have felt toward
me for cancelling our session. She couldn't get too far with that, of
course, and I almost had to say some things for her, such as: one
would have thought that I could have planned my day a little
better, or that if I really cared for her, I would have tried to see her.
She had thought of some of these things but then let me off with
the excuse that I had to cancel everyone. At first she thought it was
because she wasn't paying me, but then dismissed that interpretation
by saying that I was cancelling all my paying patients too. This incidently
indicates to me that I keep overlooking the whole question

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another thing I tried to investigate was the meaning of the fact
that her good feelings vanished with my inability to see her. I told
her that I had the fantasy of a young child performing fancy dives
on the diving board and saying all the while to his mother "watch
me, watch me," and when suddenly after a half hour he realizes that
his mother hasn't really been watching him, this strips the pleasure
from the entire procedure. In other words, it is lamentable that
Ginny has to feel good only for me. She denied this, insisting she
felt good for herself as well, but something was missing; my interpretation
was that she felt I didn't care enough.


A lot of other things are going on in her life now that are upsetting
her. She must move from the house in which she is living,
since her landlord and his wife have just gotten a divorce and everything,
including the furniture she has been using for the past year,
is being sold very quickly; Ginny immediately berates herself for
not dealing with this in a superhuman fashion. She has volunteered
to help the landlord who is incapacitated with sickness, and then
criticizes herself for not fulfilling this function with total equanimity,
when of course anyone would be upset for having to give up things
he had lived with and loved, including the landlord. It is characteristic
of Ginny to take almost any happening as a sign of her own
inferiority or lack of grace. She feeds the events of her day into a
self-critical mill churned by the power of her own self-hatred. I talked
about this, pointing out some of the "shoulds" which govern her
self-perception and impose superhuman demands. She spoke about a
girlfriend's visit and I tried to make her see their meeting from the
viewpoint of her friend; Ginny is aware of the fact that the girlfriend
thinks highly of her. I know that Ginny must be constantly exposed
to a great many good feelings about herself--the good feelings that
I have about her are shared, I suspect, by most of the people who
have continued contact with her, and I wondered with her why all
of these good feelings from others somehow never make a dent on
her basic core of self-hatred. That's about where we ended the
session today.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps a bit more than before, I begin to see some light at the
end of the labyrinth. The mere fact that Ginny was able to have a
two-day high is very heartening. Sometimes a patient can hold inside
himself this kind of experience as a reference point for future progress,
recognizing familiar terrain when he gets near again. Ginny
now tends to do the very opposite. She remembers this peak and
immediately realizes how dead she is the rest of the time. However,
I think we'll be back at this point again many times in the future.

GINNY came in extremely distraught today. Furthermore, I was
between 10 and 15 minutes late, which obviously didn't help matters.
I felt somewhat guilty during the meeting for having been late
because this was not the day to have been late for Ginny. On the
other hand, maybe it wasn't harmful since it helped her mobilize her
anger a bit toward me. I was harried by the architects in planning
the new psychiatric building across the street, and as I was leaving
today for a few days, they kept pushing me over the time limit, but
still my lateness was not absolutely unavoidable. At any rate Ginny
really feels as though she's slipped back several notches. She feels at
her very worst. What happened is that she's been under a tremendous
amount of pressure. She must find a new apartment to live in within
a week, all of her furniture is being sold out from under her, Karl
severly burned his hand because of her negligence in the kitchen,
she hasn't been able to write for three weeks, etc. etc. I felt
concerned about her increased distress this week and told her so. I'm
sure that when the dust settles, she'll feel a lot more comfortable.
However, I think it's quite important now to see clearly what she
does to herself during times of stress.


What she does is to start doing things for everyone else, then she
wallows in a great deal of self-pity, and perhaps makes herself so
pitiable that she ends up being rejected by others. What's different

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was so much going on, I had difficulty knowing what I
could do to help her; and at the end of the session I had the distinct
feeling that I hadn't been very useful. Ginny walked out looking
somewhat discouraged and downcast, probably with the feeling that
it had been a long trip to see me for no real profit.


During the interview I had tried to make her realize that the situation
was not out of control as she imagined it to be: she retained her
freedom of choice in each instance and could take any of these problems
one by one and think of corrective moves. With some minor
effort, for example, she could correct her own untidiness and the
messy rooms. However, she seemed much too distraught for such
practical suggestions to have any effect. Furthermore, she stated that
she was too harried this week to write up anything for me--she had
said everything she wanted to say last week and if she had anything
more to say, she would say it to my face. This sounded awfully

At any rate, I had some contact with the old Ginny today, a return
to discouragement, pessimism, and puzzlement on my part and to
Ginny's feelings of shame about her messiness and sloppiness; we
were both sucked into her pit of self-abasement.

GINNY started off by saying she didn't have her report, she didn't
have time to do it, but then muttered under her breath that she did
have time to go to the races. When I questioned her, she insisted she
really was much too busy, every moment of her time had been spent
in packing and moving, and any free time she gave herself was a
necessary respite from the household situation. She was depressed,
not much was happening, she had said everything there was to be
said at the last meeting. All of this left me disgruntled and I felt an
urge to scold her for not writing the report, since that's her part of
the contract she made with me. In fact, I even considered telling her
that if she wasn't going to keep up her end of the contract, I wouldn't
keep up mine. But that would make the writing extremely coercive
and mechanical, and I also hesitated from saying this because she
was so dreadfully down. For the next twenty or twenty-five minutes,
we had an extremely dull session. It was mainly a rehash of things
she's talked about before. I don't think she uttered one fresh or refreshing
phrase. Mainly she served up once again a nondescript selection
of drab morsels from her self-negating smorgasbord.


I tried to find a way to cut into this constructively, but I was
simply unable to say anything to her during the first part of the interview.

I then proceeded for the last fifteen minutes of the interview to be
a Mother-extreme. For example, she had said that one thing she liked
was when I suggested she go on the train and she had gone on the
train last time. I asked her whether she went on the train today--
she said no, and I asked her why not, and we went into the details
of why she hadn't caught the train today. Then I asked her exactly
what she had done today, and she told me what time she woke up
and what she was thinking about. I asked her what she did then and
she talked about her washing and the fact that she hadn't washed
very well and I pursued this by asking if she would like me to wash
her and she said no, but she'd like me to give her a "free shower." It
was a funny choice of words, the "free" made no sense; however, I
couldn't find out any more about that. She then talked about breakfast,
saying that she really wanted cereal and strawberries, but
wouldn't permit herself to have that, even though it may have meant
that the strawberries would remain uneaten and become rotten. She
says it's just one of the ways she has of depriving herself of what
she wants. Her mother in the past would help her decide what kind
of food to eat. I persisted in this line of questioning for awhile and we

This certainly livened things up in the interview. At one point
she said she felt very hot, almost like a sexual hotness, and then went
on from there to talk about something that sounded quite curious
and rather intriguing; she had almost decided today that she was not
going to let me get to her and that she was going to remain in control
of me by being untouchable. She remembered being that way in the
group--aloof and emotionally unreachable. I asked her more about
how that would make me feel toward her. She said that the only
word that came to mind was "in awe of." This seems to suggest that
by not being touched, by remaining somewhat dead, she manages
to control me and perhaps, through her frigidity, Karl. There is a
tight, defiant fist inside that fuzzy mitten.

THIS WAS a very tense, unsettling interview. First of all, today was
the day we exchanged our written reports of the last few months. I
haven't done too much thinking about them except to tell the
secretary to get the write-ups together. This morning I was going to
spend some time reading mine and perhaps editing them to make
them more intelligible to Ginny, since I haven't been proofing them
after dictation. As I started reading, I became more and more embarrassed
and asked myself what on earth I was doing showing all
of these to Ginny and wondered what their effect would be on her.
I finally resolved all of this by stopping after reading a couple of the
write-ups. I also glanced over a couple of Ginny's in the process but
didn't read hers systematically either, since I felt we both ought to do
that together this week and talk about it next time. One thing that
was evident to me was that in one sense the tables are turned--
Ginny often sees me as having the upper hand and yet when we look

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1002976812-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ginny came in looking very well today. She had called and
switched days so she could come a day earlier because Karl was going
to be driving her down today. The whole meeting was rather tense
and a lot of the tension was of a sexual nature. Ginny talked about
her intense sexual feelings, which seemed to circulate around me or
at least be tangential to me. When I asked her whether feeling sexy
was in any way related to seeing me today, she would go from there
to talk of masturbation, with a sense of gratitude for my having given
her permission, almost as if I were a priest-pardoner.


Then she talked about how upset she felt at calling me yester-
day to change the hour, how it was like her mother who had once
forced her to call boys on Sadie Hawkins day. I commented on the
fact that in the last session she had talked about having sex with my
delegate or helper. She said that if she could tell Karl everything
she has been able to tell me, she'd feel much more easy and would
probably be able to allow herself greater sexual freedom with him.
I wondered if an extension of this line of thought might be that if
she were to have sexual relations with me, she would be able to
unblock herself further yet. She said she sometimes thinks of that but
doesn't really permit herself to think about it for long or to fantasize
it. I suggested that she does at a subintellectual level, since she gets
flooded with sexual tension when she comes into the office. I wondered
if talking about it would help to exorcise the tension which was
present and which did seem to be blocking her today.


We had a hard time getting through the hour. Time seemed to
drag. Maybe it was the expectation of reading the reports. We discussed
the way she looked in her mini-dress, which she considered
much too short; she felt embarrassed about it, sorry she had worn it
or sorry she had not worn long pants with it. I asked what she
thought my reaction to her dress was. She didn't take me up on this
and I gratuitously told her that I hadn't noted any of the unflattering

I'm quite curious about her summaries and her response to mine.
Next week seems a long time away.

I SHOULD have written my report before I started reading your
reports. But anyway I had a fantasy in the session last time--it
belongs to my vulgar dreams. See I was so nervous and thought
that if I could have masturbated before or right there, I would be
relieved and could get on to the business at hand. This bizarre
thought had overtones and in fact was plagiarized from a scene
in <i>The Story of 0</i> where a girl does it in her office on a swivel
chair in front of a man. But this really wasn't what I was feel-
ing. I'm not sure if all of the above is real or just a clever
pastime to get out of concentrating. When I go blank, I try to
align my thoughts to things I've read in books--secondary sources
of experience.


However, what was real is that when I do personal things, I
imagine you there lots of times. So in my transparency I couldn't
see what would be the difference if you were there in my mind
or were really there. At home, for instance, you sometimes appear.
I talk to you. That day in session it was like coming in
with a stomach-ache. It was just a practical remedy, I thought.
I had all that nervous energy and no sanctuary. And your office
is like a sanctuary for me--where I can say some of the things
I need to, with amnesty, without fear of being judged. When I
need privacy other times, I station you by my bedroom door,
or next to my bed. Kind of like a psychological bouncer. You

I waited six days to write this. It's the last time I will do it
this way. From now on I will be serious.


In your write-ups you call me Ginny. Whereas I just talk to you.
But maybe because of that I have to be more careful what I say,
yours is a diary and mine's just a phone conversation where I'm
always conscious that I am connected to you and someone can
eavesdrop.
