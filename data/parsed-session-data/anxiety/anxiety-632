Let's see, it must have been sometime around 1973. Watergate was a
happening thing, and as for me, I didn't mind being poor, drinking,
smoking weed, and obsessing about nothing except how that night's
set in New York City would go, or the prospect of meeting new
women. Oh baby, what a blast to care only about stand-up and
women. Man, how I dug my early twenties. Family wasn't driving
me crazy (I mean, at least I had some logistical space), I had great
friends, and I was on a comedic mission. All I had to do was take care
of myself. It's a piece of cake when you're happy—or at least think
you are.


I was so jazzed by the daily experience of actually being accepted
as a comedian by my peers, not to mention by the parade of well-known
comics from my childhood who now watched me perform.
The same twisted quipsters who were once just images on a TV
screen making my life easier to stomach as a kid now were actually
telling me, <i>live and in person</i>, that I made them laugh. It really was a
dream come true.


Had I stopped for even a second to worry about my future in such
a capricious, self-centered, and cruel business, I might have shrieked
and hid like a coward for the remainder of my life, and done nothing
but dream about doing the thing that mattered to me. But at that
point in my life some undeniable force drove me to find some kind
of authenticity. Luckily I didn't have a realistic bone in my body and
had also felt so alone and misunderstood for seemingly forever that I
had no trouble diving into a business where most fail. In fact, failing
as a comedian never entered my mind. I was in a cocoon, living day
to day without much thought about doing anything else, ever again.
I was having the time of my life. I was on my own, forging an identity
I'd had such a hard time figuring out during my adolescence,
and answering only to what audiences seemed to like. I could then

As a recovering alcoholic looking back, I'm sort of jealous of this
former me, because I did all of this high-wire, taking-a-shot-at-the-dream
stuff while still being able to drink like, I guess, normal people
do. You lucky bastards! It's a shame H. G. Wells isn't around now
and open for business so I could rent his time machine and try to nip
my disease in the bud before it got me. No dice. Shit, alcohol is really
tricky. But as with Tricky Dick, the cover-up can last just so long if
you are destined to be taken down. Yet booze didn't control me
then. It wasn't even my friend. It was more like a cool acquaintance
who hung around just to enjoy my goings-on, and didn't ask for a
damn thing in return. It was a setup.


I drank and occasionally smoked a joint when I was back in the
sack in my numerous shacks (they were hardly apartments) with,
believe it or not, struggling comic groupies. Hmmmmmmm. "Step
right up and watch me hump and if you fake your orgasm good
enough I'll even throw in a few new monologues afterwards."


It was a real pleasure to get a nice buzz on while actually <i>nurturing
</i>a few glasses of wine <i>(nurture</i>—what an impossible thought now)
and to be in a head space where I felt so loose and self-confident that
I actually might have been legitimately relaxed and happy. In <i>those
</i>good old days when I drank, I was rarely if ever sloppy or mean-spirited.
I even think I stopped to worry about driving my car if I was too
high. Given where I've been since, by comparison, I was a picture-perfect
drinker in those days.


My idea of what a drunkard was, at that time in my life, was
based on gossip I'd heard about alcoholic relatives I rarely saw or
who were out cold when I was visiting, or on painful-to-watch
films where guys like Ray Milland and Jack Lemmon could make
you taste their own puke, or on tales about legendary artists who
drank themselves into oblivion. I never saw myself in any of those
scenarios.


This "normal" type of drinking and fucking around stayed pretty
stable for me until I was about thirty—when I suddenly started to

It was perhaps that little feeling of insecurity, which I couldn't
deal with or have much insight about, that I began to douse with
what I thought was a normal consumption of alcohol. This was a
frightful harbinger of bottles and bottles and bottles of champagne to
come in the not-too-distant future, a future filled with so many
great nights and ultimately many alcoholic escapades, until at last I
realized that my greatest accomplishment would not be having the
clout and artistry to sell out Carnegie Hall, but having the balls to
one day finally admit that I was a drunkard.


It's easy to know when you're funny, but much harder to know
when you're fucked up. I mean, how can you know? You're fucked
up. So eventually I was no longer just watching old movies about
alcoholics, I was living my own.
