Insomnia and the sleep disorders present a
variety of problems. Some are primarily
behavioral, whereas others have a dominant
biological component. Regardless of etiology,
sleep problems are remarkably common.
Approximately 65 million Americans suffer each
year from transient sleep difficulties, and about
30 million more Americans have chronic insomnia
(Hauri &amp; Linde, 1996). Moreover, approximately
35% of adults report some type of sleep
disturbance each year, with half of these individuals
describing their sleep problems as "serious"
(Gallup Organization, 1995; Mellinger, Balter,
&amp; Uhlenhuth, 1985).


The cost of sleep disorders is exorbitant.
In 1990, the National Commission on Sleep
Disorders Research, a commission created by
Congress to investigate sleep disorders and
their effects on the population, reported
the annual cost of sleep problems to be in the
tens of billions of dollars (Dement &amp;
Vaughan, 1999). In addition, estimates indicate
that 24, 000 people die each year from
accidents related to falling asleep while driving
(Dement &amp; Vaughan, 1999). The report
generated by the commission advocated
extensive training for primary care doctors, a
national awareness campaign on insomnia,
and increased awareness of the behavioral
and medical treatments available for the
treatment of sleep disorders.


Despite recommendations from the National
Commission on Sleep Disorders Research,
physicians rarely receive training in the assessment
and treatment of sleep problems. Medical
students obtain between 0 and 2 hours of training
specific to sleep disorders (Dement &amp;
Vaughan, 1999), and this lack of training is
reflected in clinical practice. For example, many
physicians do not ask about insomnia during
office visits (Dement &amp; Vaughan, 1999).
Moreover, when insomnia is recognized, physicians
defer to medication treatment rather than
very efficacious behavioral treatments. In fact,
practice guidelines from the American Medical
Association, the Canadian Medical Association,
and many health maintenance organizations
indicate that behavioral interventions should, be
the treatment of choice for insomnia.

<b>Background and Etiology</b>

<b>
<i>The Basics of Sleep, Sleep
Architecture, and Sleep Cycles</i>
</b>


Sleep is an exceedingly important activity.
Although scientists are not certain how sleep

[p. <i>426</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00436&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fatigue also contributes to a host of psychiatric
and medical diagnoses. Both anxiety
and depression have a strong sleep component.
Among patients with depression, 85%
report insomnia and 10% to 15% complain
of hypersomnia (Ford &amp; Kamerow, 1989).
Patients with bipolar disorder frequently
function energetically for days or weeks on a
few hours of sleep and then have periods of
hypersomnia associated with major depressive
episodes. Changes in sleep can predict
a major depressive episode (Perlis, Giles,
Buyesse, Tu, &amp; Kupfer, 1997), and denying
sleep to someone who has bipolar disorder
can trigger a manic episode (Ford &amp;
Kamerow, 1989). Patients with posttraumatic
stress disorder also report sleep disturbance,
including nightmares and insomnia
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994).


Insomnia is also associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis,
asthma, fibromyalgia, headaches, and chronic
pain. Between 50% and 70% of patients with
a pain diagnosis suffer from a sleep disturbance
(Moffitt, Kalucy, Kalucy, Baum, &amp;
Cooke, 1991; Pilowsky, Crettenden, &amp;
Townley, 1985). Patients with fibromyalgia,
rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, and/or
headaches have been found to have alpha
wave intrusions into their delta sleep, indicating
that their deep sleep is interrupted by
wakefulness (Gupta, Gupta, &amp; Haberman,
1986; Moldofsky, 1989).


Sleep deprivation can also cause pain. When
individuals have their deep delta sleep
interrupted, they complain of musculoskeletal
tenderness, which resolves after 2 nights of
noninterrupted sleep (Hauri &amp; Hawkins,
1973). Sleep is also essential for normal functioning
of the body's immune system and for
healthy cell growth. This explains why sleep-deprived
individuals are more likely to get sick
and tend to heal less rapidly as compared with
well-rested individuals (Hauri &amp; Linde, 1996).


The amount of sleep that humans need to
function maximally varies both by individual
and by age. Whereas newborns need about
16 hours of sleep per day, 2-year-olds need
about 13 hours. Teenagers require about 9 hours
of sleep per night, and adults need 7 to 8 hours
on average. Interestingly, the amount of sleep
an individual may require varies from about
5 hours to 11 hours. Therefore, 7 or 8 hours
per night reflects an average. Adults over age
65 years need as much sleep as do younger
adults, but their sleep tends to be less deep and
they tend to wake more during the night.
Researchers are not sure why this is the case,
but they believe that it may be a natural outcome
of aging or that it may be related to
decreased activity, medications, and/or having a
variable schedule. Approximately half of adults
over age 65 years have a chronic sleep disorder.


<b>
<i>Sleep Cycles</i>
</b>


There are five stages of sleep that occur in
cycles during the night. These are referred to as
Stages 1 to 4 and REM (rapid eye movement)
sleep. Each stage is defined by depth of sleep,
brain wave activity, eye movements, and muscle
tone. Stage 1 sleep is a light sleep and is characterized
by short fast brain waves (called, theta
waves) and slow eye movements. This type of
sleep occurs at the beginning of the night or
during the day with boredom or fatigue. People
are easily aroused, from a Stage 1 sleep and on

[p. <i>427</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00437&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

REM sleep is distinct from the other stages
of sleep. Humans are very active physiologically
during REM. For example, during REM,
the muscles of the body stiffen, eyes move
rapidly, and heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen
use, and respiration become more rapid
and variable. In addition, during REM,
reflexes, kidney function, and hormonal patterns
change. The body's temperature regulation
is affected such that people will not sweat
or shiver. During REM sleep, both genders
experience engorgement of the genital region--
causing erections in males and clitoral
engorgement in females. It is during REM
sleep that humans dream.


A typical sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes,
and healthy sleepers complete four to six cycles
per night on average. After a few minutes in
Stage 1 sleep, Stages 2, 3, and 4 occur. Stage 2
sleep repeats, followed by REM sleep, before
the next 90-minute cycle begins. During the
early part of the night, a greater amount of
time is spent in deep Stages 3 and 4 sleep.
Closer to morning, REM sleep is lengthier.
During the night, normal adults spend about
5% of the night in Stage 1 sleep, 50% in Stage 2
sleep, 5% in Stage 3 sleep, 10% to 15% in
Stage 4 sleep, and 20% to 25% in REM sleep.
Most people can function well if they are able
to complete four to six sleep cycles during a
night (thereby sleeping about 6 to 9 hours).


<b>
<i>Insomnia</i>
</b>


Insomnia is the most common sleep problem.
It is characterized by an inability to fall
asleep quickly (generally within 30 minutes),
waking during the night with difficulty in
returning to sleep, waking too early in the
morning, and/or having nonrestorative sleep.
In addition, sleep disruption must occur at
least 3 nights per week.


Insomnia is typically categorized in terms of
chronicity. Transient insomnia typically lasts a
few nights to a few weeks. Most people will
experience transient insomnia sometime during
a year. Transient insomnia can be triggered
by a variety of factors, including stress, life
changes, illness, a poor sleep environment, shift
work, medication changes, jet lag, and poor
sleep habits. Transient insomnia can become
chronic due to classical conditioning. For
example, one patient described insomnia that
started after a divorce. He described waking
during the night because of stress and sadness;
after smoking a cigarette, he was able to fall
back asleep. This patient reported that the
divorce was finalized 3 years ago. He felt like he
had moved on emotionally, but he still awakened
during the night and could not fall asleep
until he smoked a cigarette. Unfortunately, the
attempts made to try to improve sleep often
worsen the problem. Chronic insomnia can last
from a month to many decades, causing both
functional (e.g., decreased concentration,
depression) and medical (e.g., headaches,
hypertension) complications.


<b>
<i>Restless Leg Syndrome and
Periodic Limb Movement Disorder</i>
</b>


Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is defined as an
urge to move or shake the lower extremities
because of an uncomfortable sensation. Most
often, this affects the legs, but it also is experienced
in the arms or in muscles in other parts
of the body. The feeling typically is more exaggerated
in the evening and often can prevent a

[p. <i>428</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00438&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Periodic leg movement disorder (PLMD)
is an insomnia disorder that is accompanied
by repetitive episodes of muscle contractions
(0.5 to 5.0 seconds in duration) separated
by intervals of 20 to 30 seconds. Awakenings
may be associated with these movements.
Most patients with RLS have PLMD.


The prevalence of RLS and PLMD in the
general population is between 9% and 15%
(Hening et al., 1999). The number of cases
increases as people age and the symptoms
can become more intrusive with time.
Approximately 43% of people with RLS
describe the onset of the disorder before age
20 years (Hening et al., 1999). Prevalence rates
for PLMD in people age 60 years or over range
from 20% to 58% (Dickel &amp; Mosko, 1990).


<b>
<i>Sleep Apnea</i>
</b>


The definition of a sleep apnea episode is
the cessation of airflow through the nose or
mouth that lasts 10 seconds or longer. Sleep
apnea can be caused by a variety of conditions
and can be exacerbated by alcohol use or allergies.
There are three types of sleep apnea: central,
obstructive, and mixed. Central sleep
apnea is the cessation of breathing due to lack
of respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea
is characterized by sufficient respiratory effort
from the lungs but blockage (obstruction) of
the airway. The mixed category refers to apnea
in which the obstructive phase follows a central
phase, thereby combining both central and
obstructive sleep apnea. People of any age can
have sleep apnea, although it is more common
in older adults and in those who are obese.


Patients should be evaluated for sleep
apnea if they are experiencing excessive day-time
sleepiness. This manifests in falling asleep
at inopportune times, for example, while driving
or during meetings. Sleep apnea sufferers also
tend to snore loudly. The consequences of
sleep apnea can be severe because patients not
only will lack sufficient oxygen in the blood
but also will have excess carbon dioxide. They
frequently have comorbidities, including cardiac
arrhythmia, headache, malaise, fatigue,
weight gain, and night sweats. In addition,
sleep apnea sufferers are frequently awakened
through the night as they try to clear their
airways; they rarely complete 90-minute sleep
cycles. To clear their airway, sufferers may
gasp or describe a feeling of drowning. They
tend to be the most fatigued patients referred
to sleep clinics for evaluation.


<b>
<i>Narcolepsy</i>
</b>


Narcolepsy is a disorder distinguished by
the rapid onset of a sleep cycle, typically
triggered by periods of excitement. People
often have their first episode of narcolepsy
between ages 10 and 30 years (Hauri &amp;
Linde, 1996). Reports indicate that there are
100, 000 to 600, 000 narcoleptics in the
United States (Hauri &amp; Linde, 1996).


Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy
(i.e., lack of muscle tone), hypnagogic hallucinations
(i.e., dreamlike hallucinations), and
sleep paralysis. During a narcoleptic episode,
the patient immediately will go into REM sleep.
Patients with narcolepsy often report vivid
dreams or hallucinations. Obviously, this disorder
is an extremely dangerous condition given
that people can fall asleep without warning
while driving or operating heavy machinery.


The cause of narcolepsy appears to be
genetic, and treatment is usually medication.
Both stimulants and antidepressants have
been prescribed, and some patients find relief
by taking naps during the day. More
recently, modafinil has improved wakefulness
in patients with this problem. Although
untreated narcoleptic patients fall asleep
rapidly and without warning during the day,

[p. <i>429</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00439&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>
<i>Dreams, Nightmares, Sleep
Terrors, and Sleepwalking</i>
</b>


People dream during REM sleep; therefore,
dreams typically occur at the end of
the night when REM sleep is longer. People
dream for about 2 hours every night and
recall dreams if awakened quickly from
REM sleep. Dreams can also be remembered,
through specific training strategies designed
to enhance recall.


Throughout history, people have looked to
their dreams for meaning and prophecy. There
are varying theories as to the importance of
dreams; some psychologists (e.g., Carl Jung)
have spent much of their careers investigating
the role of dreams as a window to the unconscious.
Other professionals believe that dreams
are simply people's interpretations of the physiological
arousal that occurs with REM sleep
(Walsleben &amp; Baron-Faust, 2000). Regardless,
many laypeople believe that dreams are meaningful
and are disturbed when they have
anxiety-producing dreams or nightmares.


Sleep terrors typically occur in children.
Unlike nightmares, sleep terrors occur earlier
in the evening during the deep delta sleep
(Stages 3 and 4). Nightmares tend to occur
toward the end of the night when REM sleep
is longer. Because children have more delta
sleep than do adults, children are more prone
to night terrors.

<b>Assessment and Treatment</b>

<b>
<i>Evaluation/Assessment Phases</i>
</b>


Because the etiologies of sleep disorders are
multifaceted, a thorough evaluation is imperative
to ensure appropriate treatment planning.
An initial interview should include questions
regarding sleep onset, number of awakenings,
total hours of sleep achieved, sleep habits,
snoring, and level of fatigue during the day.
Diet, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, medications,
herbs, medical conditions, and exercise should
also be evaluated. It is important to note that
patients will frequently underestimate the
amount of sleep they achieve. Therefore, it can
be useful to interview a spouse to corroborate
the information given. Another method of
evaluating sleep patterns is to have the patient
complete a sleep journal. Unfortunately,
patients often have difficulty in complying with
this recommendation, or they report inaccurate
information.


When self-report techniques are insufficient
for diagnosis and treatment planning for a
sleep disorder, a patient may benefit from
a polysomnogram test. A polysomnogram
involves using electroencephalography (EEG)
to monitor brain and muscle activity, heart
rate, and respiration. By interpreting brain
waves and muscle activity, a specialist can
identify the type of sleep disorder.


If a patient complains of loud snoring and
reports periods of no breathing followed by
gasps for air, an evaluation for possible sleep
apnea should, be arranged. A test for blood
oxygen levels, called oximetry, is often used
to evaluate for sleep apnea.


<b>
<i>Treatment of Insomnia</i>
</b>


Treatment of insomnia integrates sleep
hygiene (i.e., good, sleep habits), stimulus control,
relaxation training, and sleep restriction
components. These behavioral strategies are
effective for 70% to 80% of patients with
primary insomnia (Morin et al., 1999). In a
review of the literature on the use of nonpharmacological
treatments for insomnia, Morin
and colleagues (1999) found that patients
treated with behavioral interventions were
"better off" (i.e., they fell asleep faster after
treatment) than approximately 80% of
untreated controls. In addition, patients
taught cognitive-behavioral skills slept longer,

[p. <i>430</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00440&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Improvements in sleep were maintained on
follow-up. After 3 and 6 months, patients given
cognitive-behavioral intervention maintained
gains realized in sleep onset and number of
awakenings (Morin et al., 1999). In fact, some
studies show that patients actually sleep longer
at night 6 months following treatment than
during the initial posttreatment assessment
(Morin et al., 1999). This may be because
patients need a few months to fully integrate
behavioral strategies into their lives. Additional
long-term benefits of cognitive-behavioral
training for insomnia include a reduction in
medication use and increased independence
from medical intervention (Morin et al., 1999).


Reflecting the breadth of literature supporting
the use of behavioral treatments for insomnia
and the side effect profiles of most hypnotics,
current best practice guidelines from the
American Medical Association and the
Canadian Medical Association indicate that
behavioral treatment should be the frontline
treatment for insomnia. However, because of
inadequate provider training and an over-reliance
on the "quick fix" (i.e., medication),
physicians rarely use structured behavioral treatments
to treat insomnia. Instead, most people
who suffer from insomnia use over-the-counter
medications or prescription sleep aids.


<i>Core Components of Cognitive-Behavioral
Treatment for Insomnia</i>


<i>Stimulus Control Therapy</i>. Stimulus control
therapy teaches patients to use environmental
cues to augment, rather than inhibit,
sleep. The premise of the therapy is that individuals
will be reconditioned to sleep efficiently
when sleep-incompatible activities are
reduced and sleep-associated activities are
increased. Patients receive the following basic
rules pertaining to the bedroom environment.
First, they are to use their beds for sex and
sleep only; they are not to read, watch television,
or do business or other work in bed; and
they are not to stay in bed if awake for longer
than 20 minutes at a time. Second, they are to
go to bed only when sleepy. Third, they are to
maintain a regular wake-up time. Fourth,
they are to avoid napping during the day.


<i>Sleep Restriction</i>. The goal of sleep restriction
is to train patients to sleep more efficiently
by limiting the amount of time spent in bed.
This strategy capitalizes on fatigue so as to
train their bodies to fall asleep quickly and
to sleep through the night. Patients are first
instructed to compute their sleep efficiency by
dividing their time spent sleeping by their time
spent in bed. They estimate the average
amount of time they spend sleeping at night.
Next, they choose a wake-up time that
they will adhere to every day of the week.
Additional recommendations are to avoid napping
and to get out of bed if still awake after
20 minutes (e.g., from stimulus control training).
After the assessment and setup phase,
patients select one of the following techniques.


<i>Significantly delay going to bed</i>. This strategy
is the most difficult because it requires the
patient to go to bed much later than usual
while keeping his or her wake-up time constant.
First, the patient determines a wake-up
time that can be adhered to strictly. The initial
bedtime is established using the average
number of hours of sleep a patient achieves.
For example, if a woman typically spends
9 hours in bed but only sleeps 6 hours because
of waking, the recommendation is to spend
only 6 hours in bed. If her wake-up time is
6:00 a.m., she would go to bed at midnight the
first night. She would follow the stimulus control
strategy and get up if she is not asleep
within 20 minutes. She would also get out of
bed if she wakes for longer than 20 minutes
during the night. The patient then would continue
to go to bed at midnight until she achieves

[p. <i>431</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00441&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Delay bedtime by 15 minutes</i>. This strategy
advises the patient to go to bed 15 minutes
later than usual every night until he or she is
able to fall asleep quickly and sleep through
the night. Therefore, the previously mentioned
patient would still have a consistent wake-up
time of 6:00 a.m. and would still follow the
20-minute rule, but instead of going to bed at
9:00 p.m., she would go to bed at 9:15 p.m. If
she cannot achieve 85% sleep efficiency after a
few nights, she would go to bed at 9:30 p.m.
Eventually, this patient may find that if she
goes to bed at 10:45 p.m., she is able to fall
asleep quickly and sleep through the night.


<i>Use an intermediate delay in going to bed</i>.
The third strategy is an intermediate one
between the first two strategies. The patient
first sets a consistent wake-up time, avoids
napping, and follows the 20-minute rule. The
patient is then instructed to go to bed as late as
possible. This intermediate strategy works well
for many patients because they cannot stay up
late enough to use the first strategy. Also, this
third strategy tends to work more quickly than
the second strategy. The previously mentioned
patient would continue to stay up late until
she achieves above 85% sleep efficiency. Then,
she would go to bed 15 minutes earlier until she
found the time when she could maintain good
sleep efficiency and feel rested during the day.


These sleep restriction techniques capitalize
on patients' fatigue to help them learn, adopt,
and maintain good sleep habits. Many insomniacs
actually cause their own insomnia by going
to bed too early and by failing to maintain a
consistent sleep schedule. Typically, patients will
have one or two bad nights of sleep because of
a transient event and will adjust their bedtime
to be earlier because they feel fatigued. This is
problematic because the body is not accustomed
to spending additional time in bed, and in an
attempt to accommodate the change in bedtime,
sleep cycles are altered and sleep becomes less
efficient.


When informed of this pattern, patients
often identify that their sleep difficulties
began when they initiated a change in their
bedtime by going to bed earlier due to a
partner's schedule, an illness, or a stressful
period. With appropriate information,
patients learn after a few nights of poor sleep
to go to bed a little later. They understand
that attempts to address a few nights of poor
sleep by going to bed earlier is not effective,
even though going to bed earlier makes intuitive
sense if a person is fatigued.


<i>Sleep Hygiene</i> (<i>i.e., good sleep habits</i>).
Sleep hygiene refers to health practices (e.g.,
diet, exercise, substance use) and environmental
factors (e.g., noise, light, a comfortable
bed, ambient temperature) that may be
inhibiting sleep. In terms of health practices,
patients are instructed to reduce caffeine use
to less than five cups of coffee or tea a day and
to avoid using any caffeine after 2:00 p.m.
Caffeine has a half-life of 4 hours; therefore,
half of the caffeine consumed at 4:00 p.m. will
still be in the body at 8:00 p.m., and a quarter
of the initial cup of coffee or tea consumed at
4:00 p.m. will be in the body at midnight.


Patients should also limit nicotine intake
and never smoke if they wake during the
night. This suggestion will help to eliminate
waking to smoke. Frequently, smokers classically
condition themselves to wake at the end
of each 90-minute sleep cycle for a cigarette.
Finally, patients are told to refrain from using
alcohol as a sleep-inducing aid. Although
alcohol can make people feel sleepy, it inhibits

[p. <i>432</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00442&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In terms of sleep hygiene, patients are also
educated about the benefits of daily exercise
for sleep but are cautioned to avoid vigorous
exercise too close to bedtime. Exercising
intensely before going to bed can cause problems
with falling asleep because people
may find themselves too energized (due to
the release of the endorphins) or too hot to
sleep. The body naturally cools as it prepares
to sleep. Therefore, if people are too hot due
to exercise or hot summer temperatures, they
often have a hard time sleeping.


In addition, individuals need to make sure
that their rooms are dark and quiet and that
their beds are comfortable. Because light
helps to reset the biological clock, it is essential
to avoid, bright lights in the evening and to
expose the body to bright light in the morning.
Shift workers can have a difficult time falling
asleep after the "graveyard shift," particularly
if they drive home in the morning light without
sunglasses.


Patients sometimes state that their partners
snore or that there is intermittent noise coming
from the street that keeps them awake at
night. Unfortunately, intermittent noise is the
worst type of noise for sleep. The body can
acclimate to consistent noise (e.g., the sound
of crickets or of a nearby freeway) or to total
quiet, but intermittent noise can cause waking.
Suggestions for managing this include using
white noise (e.g., turning on a fan or a fish
tank) and using earplugs. It is not uncommon
for couples to sleep apart if one snores loudly
or has PLMD.


Most often, sleep hygiene rules are integrated,
into a treatment program. A few studies
have evaluated the effectiveness of using
sleep hygiene education alone and have
found a modest effect (Morin et al., 1999).
One study found that approximately 27% of
patients improved when given sleep hygiene
education (Schoicket, Bertelson, &amp; Lacks,
1988), but other studies have found a more
modest response to this intervention (Morin
et al., 1999). In general, sleep hygiene is considered
a necessary part of an intervention but
insufficient as a stand-alone treatment.


<i>Relaxation-Based Interventions</i>. Relaxation
techniques have also proved to be useful
in insomnia treatment. Studies have shown
that progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback,
imagery training, and thought stopping
all can reduce autonomic arousal and facilitate
sleep (Morin et al., 1999). Biofeedback and
progressive muscle relaxation help individuals
to relax the muscles of the body and activate
the parasympathetic nervous system or relaxation
response. Imagery training and thought
stopping help to retrain the mind to focus on
calming thoughts, thereby reducing the sympathetic
nervous system response and hopefully
activating the parasympathetic nervous
system. Although other relaxation-based
interventions have been advocated for insomnia
(e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, meditation,
hypnosis), these have not been adequately
evaluated (Morin et al., 1999).


Relaxation-based interventions are important
in facilitating sleep. Many insomniacs
become so anxious about falling asleep that
they activate the sympathetic nervous system,
thereby releasing endorphins, tensing
the muscles, and increasing heartbeat and
respiration rate. As one might expect, this
response is incompatible with falling asleep.
Through classical conditioning (i.e., anxiety
regarding falling asleep that is then paired
with one's bed), a transient sleep problem
can become chronic. Insomniacs who have
developed a strong association between anxiety
and their beds often say that they can fall
asleep easily in a hotel room or in the guest
room but can never fall asleep quickly in
their own beds. The primary goal of the
relaxation therapies is to reassociate the bed
with a restful state and help reduce the
anxiety or autonomic arousal associated
with sleep.

<i>Paradoxical Intention</i>. Paradoxical intention
is a cognitive technique in which the patient is
requested, to stay awake. If the patient is
instructed to stay awake, falling asleep is no
longer the anxiety-producing goal. Thus, by
prescribing the patient's worst fear--staying
awake--the patient paradoxically responds by
falling asleep more quickly. In essence, this intervention
helps to reduce the performance anxiety
associated with sleeping.


<i>Developing a Cognitive-Behavioral
Sleep Improvement Program</i>


Most of the treatment programs in use
today include multiple sessions and integrate
stimulus control, sleep hygiene, relaxation
training, and sleep restriction components.
These programs are often six to eight sessions
in length and may require additional sessions
for screening and paperwork. Evaluations of
these programs are often dependent on patient
self-report through sleep diaries, although a
few studies use polysomnogram tests to
measure outcome.


At Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento,
California, a single-session treatment program
was developed and evaluated using individual
(<i>n</i> = 20) and group (<i>n</i> = 72) formats (Wolfe &amp;
Helge, 2002). Primary care physicians
referred patients to a health psychologist, who
administered an insomnia treatment protocol.
Individual sessions were 25 minutes, and the
group sessions were 90 minutes. Before treatment,
each patient completed a brief questionnaire
that included queries about sleep onset,
awakenings, daytime fatigue, and sleep habits.
In addition, there were questions regarding substance
use, diet, and exercise. Approximately
75% of referred patients attended the program
(Wolfe &amp; Helge, 2002).


The first section of the intervention was
informational, including information about
sleep cycles, sleep architecture, individual variations
in sleep, and sleep changes over the life
cycle. The second section of the intervention
included information regarding stimulus
control, sleep restriction, and thought stopping.
The final section included a review of sleep
hygiene, exercise, sleeping pills, herbs, and
melatonin. The information regarding sleep
cycles and sleep architecture was designed to
provide the supporting rationale for implementation
of sleep restriction, stimulus control, and
sleep hygiene. Patients created a personalized
sleep plan during the group and individual
appointments (Wolfe &amp; Helge, 2002).


One month after treatment, patients'
progress was assessed by telephone follow-up.
Results indicated that 90% of the patients
who had individual appointments and 74% of
the patients who attended group appointments
improved the amount of time spent sleeping at
night (Wolfe &amp; Helge, 2002). Individuals
gained an average of 1.78 hours of sleep per
night, and group members gained an average of
1.90 hours of sleep per night (Wolfe &amp; Helge,
2002). A second cohort of patients (<i>n</i> = 35) who
participated, in the same treatment protocol, but
with a different health psychologist, had results
slightly better than participants in the initial
cohort (Wolfe, Helge, &amp; Jacobs, 2002). One
month after treatment, 87% of these patients
reported improved sleep by an average of 2.38
hours per night (Wolfe et al., 2002). All participants
were to be reassessed 1 year following
treatment to determine whether treatment gains
were maintained.


Anecdotal comments from participants
were interesting. A common theme was skepticism
about the techniques. For example, a
typical remark was "I thought what you suggested
was silly, but I decided to try it anyway."
Another typical patient comment was
"I did not think it would work, but I was
amazed at the results." Finally, some patients
noted benefits from the information about
insomnia: "I thought I had depression, but
now I realize I was just sleep deprived."


This intervention was developed with the
purpose of efficiently and effectively treating
primary care patients with insomnia. The

<i>Medications Used to Treat Insomnia</i>


In today's "quick fix" society, patients
and providers alike have a penchant for medications
as the frontline treatment for insomnia.
Even before office visits, patients have
often tried over-the-counter medications
such as diphenhydramine and Tylenol PM
(a combination of diphenhydramine and
Tylenol) for sleep. If these medications were
as effective as advertised, it is unlikely that
patients would continue to seek assistance
from their primary care providers.


Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed
for sleep. These agents replaced barbiturates
and barbiturate-like substances that were
associated with addiction, respiratory problems,
and occasional deaths. A benefit of
benzodiazepines and other hypnotics used
for insomnia is that they work quickly.
However, hypnotics can cause daytime sedation,
tolerance, and rebound insomnia.


Current guidelines from the National
Institutes of Health (1984, 1991) suggest that
short-term use of hypnotic medications may
be indicated for acute insomnia, but these
medications should be used with caution. If
prescribed for sleep, hypnotics should not be
taken for more than 2 weeks. At the time of
prescribing, a tapering strategy should be in
place to minimize risk for potential problems.
One strategy to avoid tolerance is to have the
patient use the medication only 3 or 4 nights
a week and to use the lowest effective dose. A
patient who has an abuse history or who has
to perform tasks that require alertness and
quick reaction times (e.g., driving) on awakening
should be cautioned when prescribed
sleep aids. Finally, hypnotics prescribed to
elder adults require extra care.


Trazadone is an antidepressant frequently
prescribed for people who have insomnia
and a depressive disorder. However, the
Food and Drug Administration has not
approved the use of trazadone for people
with insomnia. Trazadone should, be used
with caution because it can cause daytime
sedation, priapism, and hypotension.


Melatonin is a hormone often used for insomnia.
It is released by the pineal gland into the
bloodstream and is produced from tryptophan.
Tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan,
then to serotonin, then to N-acetylserotonin,
and finally to melatonin. Melatonin
regulates the body's sleep cycle, circadian
rhythm, and endocrine production and is
essential for sexual maturation, growth control,
pain control, balance, and regulation of sexual
activity (Natural Medicines Comprehensive
Database, 2002). People produce more melatonin
when it is dark, thereby stimulating the
onset of sleep. It may be an effective agent to
help some adults with sleep onset. Moreover,
melatonin may be useful for symptoms of jet
lag, for shift workers, and for insomniacs with
blindness. However, data demonstrating the
efficacy of melatonin are inconclusive.


Although most consider melatonin relatively
safe, it is not for use in children because it may
affect their maturation. There also is concern
that taking melatonin may increase daytime
somnolence. In addition, melatonin may
interfere with the effectiveness of cardiac medication
and medications used to reduce immune
system response (e.g., steroids, other cortisone

<i>
<b>Treatment of RLS and PLMD</b>
</i>


Behavioral strategies for treating RLS and
PLMD include moderate amounts of exercise
in the evening, hot baths, and distraction.
Walking before bedtime has been helpful for
some patients. However, intense exercise
appears to exacerbate the symptoms for many
sufferers. Hot baths are effective for some
patients, and distraction exercises (i.e., tasks
that require intense concentration) have support
for symptom reduction. In addition, some
patients find relief from massage or vibrating
stimulation before sleep, and there is some evidence
that reducing caffeine and improving
sleep habits are useful. Most of the published
literature has focused on medication treatment
for RLS and PLMD, but there is some evidence
to support integrating behavioral strategies
with pharmacological regimens.


Unfortunately, many of the medications used
in treating RLS and PLMD have limited effectiveness
and can cause tolerance and rebound
symptoms. There are five classes of medications
typically prescribed: dopaminergic medications,
opioids, benzodiazepines, adrenergic medications,
and anticonvulsant medications. A review
of the costs and benefits of these agents is
beyond, the scope of this chapter, but Hening
and colleagues (1999) provided an excellent
review of the treatments for RLS and PLMD.


Folic acid and iron supplements have proved
to be effective for patients with RLS and PLMD
who are deficient in these minerals. Some
reports suggest that the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or tricyclic medications
reduce symptoms of RLS, whereas other reports
indicate that these medications can aggravate
the disorder (Hening et al., 1999).


<b>
<i>Treatment of Sleep Apnea</i>
</b>


Treatment of sleep apnea is dependent on
the etiology. For example, in children, a common
cause of sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils.
With tonsil removal, the apnea can be relieved.
Other surgical techniques, lauded as permanent
cures for obstructive sleep apnea, have not been
as effective as originally expected. With patients
who are obese, the best treatment is weight
reduction because this serves to open adequate
space for airflow. One of the most successful
treatments for other patients with obstructive
sleep apnea is the continuous positive airway
pressure machine (CPAP).


The CPAP provides continuous positive
airway pressure through the nostrils to force
the airway clear, enabling the patient to
breathe. This treatment is effective for many
people, but a major complaint is discomfort in
wearing the apparatus. In fact, many of the
patients given a CPAP do not adhere to recommendations
to use it. It is critical that the
facemask fits properly and that the patient
acclimates to the machine. This is often done
by training the patient in relaxation techniques
and having him or her use the machine
while awake but during sedentary activities
such as watching television. Having a machine
force air through one's nose can be extremely
uncomfortable, especially while trying to initiate
sleep onset. Therefore, adequate training
and problem solving are essential given that
the consequences of living with untreated
sleep apnea are unfortunate and avoidable.


<b>
<i>Light Therapy</i>
</b>


Light therapy has been investigated as a treatment
for patients with a variety of problems,

[p. <i>436</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00446&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In general, light therapy is effective in
treating delayed sleep phase syndrome and
advanced sleep phase syndrome (Chesson
et al., 1999). With delayed sleep phase syndrome,
the individual has difficulty in initiating
sleep at the appropriate time and awakens
too late. With advanced sleep phase syndrome,
the patient falls asleep too early at night and
awakens too early in the morning. With both
sleep phase disorders, the release of hormones
and the level of body temperature indicate
that the person's sleep phase is not oriented
correctly. Having individuals expose themselves
to bright light in the morning and wear
darkened glasses at night appears to be effective
in resetting the circadian rhythm and
resuming a regular sleep schedule (Chesson
et al., 1999). In addition, light therapy appears
to be useful with seasonal affective disorder
(Chesson et al., 1999). Light therapy is
described as a safe intervention when used
according to American Academy of Sleep
Medicine guidelines. It may be useful for shift
work problems, jet lag, and non-24-hour
sleep/wake syndrome in some blind, patients
(Chesson et al., 1999).


<b>
<i>Napping and Sleep Deprivation</i>
</b>


Approximately a quarter of all Americans
are sleep deprived (National Sleep Foundation,
2002). This translates into billions of dollars in
lost productivity and accidents. In response to
this pervasive sleep debt, many businesses have
created special environments for napping, and
there have been articles in the popular press
describing the benefit of quick "power naps."


Sleep "debt" can be "repaid" with a brief
nap during waking hours; however, there is an
optimal strategy for napping. Ideally, a nap
should last between 15 and 40 minutes or be
2 hours in length. A brief nap can be very
restorative. The most favorable time to take a
nap is early afternoon. This is when people's
natural biological clock indicates that it may be
time for a sleep cycle. Some patients successfully
time their naps halfway between the time
they awaken in the morning and the time they
go to bed, finding a 15-or 20-minute nap to be
adequate to renew their concentration and
energy. However, insomniacs should be wary
of napping. Napping late in the afternoon can
negatively influence nighttime sleep. If an
insomniac has rested during the day, he or she
might not be fatigued enough to fall asleep
quickly at night.


<b>
<i>Treatment of Nightmares
and Night Terrors</i>
</b>


Nightmares tend to be more common
when patients are under stress. There are two
main treatments to help patients cope with
undesirable dreams. The first involves reassurance
that intense dreams are common and
that dreaming about something is not an
indication that one would act in a similar
manner in real life. Often, patients present
with sexual or violent dreams and express
concern that these dreams are indicative of
underlying desires. Through reassurance and
normalization, their distress can be reduced.
Recommendations to avoid the daily news,
violent movies, and other negative images
before bedtime also are helpful. In addition,
patients can learn to dream about pleasant
scenes by rehearsing these images before bed.


For recurrent nightmares (e.g., being chased
or pummeled by a foe), patients are instructed
to return to the dream and change the ending.
This is particularly helpful with children who
are taught to imagine themselves as their
favorite superhero and then turning on the foe
and winning the battle. For this strategy to be
effective, the patient should create the image
that makes the most sense to him or her to be

[p. <i>437</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00447&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Night terrors can be particularly alarming
to parents. They often involve brief periods of
screaming; children may open their eyes,
begin perspiring, and appear to be experiencing
a state of panic. After a few minutes, a
calm state of sleep returns. Usually, an individual
experiencing a night terror will not

[p. <i>438</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00448&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Three additional strategies can be helpful in
reducing night terrors. First, psychotherapy for
stress reduction is useful. Second, advising the
patient to sleep for a longer period, thereby
reducing the amount of deep delta sleep, can
help. Third, physicians may prescribe a benzodiazepine,
such as diazepam, for a few days to
reduce the delta sleep associated with night terrors.
This last strategy may be helpful if a child
is sleeping away from home and is concerned
about arousing others. However, benzodiazepines
should always be used with caution.


Sleepwalking is also associated with delta
sleep and is more common with children than
with adults. It is also more frequent when
people are under stress or sleep deprived,
and it can be a result of certain medications.
Sleepwalking can be quite dangerous.
Treatments include reducing stress, getting
adequate sleep, ensuring a safe sleeping environment,
and taking medication.

<b>Conclusions</b>

Each year, sleep disorders affect millions of
people and cost billions of dollars in lost
productivity, health care, and accidents. For
the majority of sleep problems, including
insomnia and nightmares, cognitive-behavioral
intervention is the treatment of choice. For
other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, RLS,
and PLMD, behavioral interventions play a
significant role. However, it is far from routine
practice for patients with sleep problems to
receive these interventions or learn about them
during visits to primary care clinics.


Enhanced training during medical school has
been recommended as one strategy to improve
assessment and intervention for patients with
sleep problems (Dement &amp; Vaughan, 1999).
Unfortunately, physician training continues to
be limited in this regard, and this deficiency is
reflected in clinical practice; medications continue
as the first line of intervention for sleep
problems that would be better treated with
behavioral interventions. This observation is not
too surprising. Physicians generally report difficulties
in identifying behavioral problems in
their patients and frustration with implementing
behavioral change strategies (Alto, 1995).


A realistic practice solution is access to
behavioral experts who can provide effective
cognitive-behavioral interventions in primary
care. This strategy is practical because many
patients with a sleep disorder will also present
with medical and psychiatric complaints. A
behavioral-medical approach, the integration
of medical and behavioral sciences, appears to
be an excellent solution for the sizable population
of those suffering with sleep disorders.

<b>Case Study</b>

"John Doe," a 39-year-old male, presented to his primary care physician with
symptoms of anxiety, irritability, decreased concentration, headaches, and insomnia.
He stated that his problems began about 5 years ago when he relocated, married, and
changed his job. He reported feeling happy with his current situation and satisfied
with his marital relationship and his job, but he revealed that he felt "run down."


When queried, about sleep habits, John denied having difficulty in falling asleep
but stated that he awakened frequently during the night. He said that he went to
bed at 9:30 p.m. because he was "too tired to stay up any later," but then he awakened
at 3:30 a.m. and drifted in and out of sleep until it was time to get ready for
work at 6:30. He was concerned that he may be depressed because he felt "worn
out and sad" even though his life was good.


John noted that his sleep habits changed following his marriage. When single, he
would, go to bed at midnight and get up at 6:30 a.m. He reported that with this schedule,
he felt rested and refreshed. However, when he married, he began to go to bed at
10:00 p.m. because this was his wife's bedtime. During the past year, he altered his
bedtime to 9:30 p.m. in an effort to combat his ever-present fatigue. He was concerned
that his lack of energy was beginning to affect his work and relationships.


A physical examination determined that John was in good health. Laboratory
results were within normal limits. The patient was instructed to use sleep restriction
to retrain his body to sleep well. Specifically, he was to go to bed later in the
evening until he could fall asleep quickly and sleep through the night. He was
reminded that he felt rested after 6.5 hours of sleep and that his previous sleep
schedule of going to bed at midnight and waking at 6:30 a.m. was effective for him.


After 1 week, John reported feeling much better. He stated that going to bed later
was very difficult at first because he was so tired, but after 3 nights his sleep had
improved and he began to feel better. In addition, he started walking daily at lunch
and found that his energy level and mood had improved. During a follow-up visit,
his progress was reviewed and recidivism was discussed. John was quite pleased with
his improvements because he felt more like himself again. In addition, he reported
that his mood and concentration were better and that his headaches had decreased.
One year later, he denied any ongoing problems with sleep. He noted that during
periods of transient insomnia, he continued to use sleep restriction strategies that
provide him with rapid improvement.
