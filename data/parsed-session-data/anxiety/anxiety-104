BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
COUNSELOR: One-eight, January 22, 1971, session number 1.
PATIENT: Are you just sitting there waiting for me to say something?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
PATIENT: I can't - what - I don't even know what I'm supposed to talk about.
COUNSELOR: Well, it doesn't really matter, like, you know, whether you start with what's on your mind, what made you want to come for therapy, what you're feeling like, what you're trying to do.
PATIENT: I told my roommate, she just tells me to go (inaudible at 0:00:42.3) thing to say. I think basically, the reason I want - considered therapy is because I've been considering possibly going to a psychiatrist or a psychologist or something for about three years because I never really - I was always unhappy but I never really knew why.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:01:05.3
PATIENT: And giving it a lot of thought and I've decided basically what's the matter is I just don't like myself. And I'm not sure why I don't like myself. But I've noticed a weird kind of unconscious reaction, like, all my life I've gotten compliments on my smile. And so I hate my smile. I stand in front of the mirror, check out these different smiles and then I don't like it. I just don't like it at all. And I thought this was really weird. I mean, you know, I used to say to myself - people would say that and I'd think to myself, oh, wow, all of a sudden I realize that I was actually really disliking anything anybody complimented me on and that's weird.
And I don't know why, but also a sense in the fact that, I mean, I've also felt very alone now with my life.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I've adapted and my brother's (inaudible at 0:02:03.6), we're not blood relatives (inaudible at 0:02:04.8). And I've know that I was adopted ever since I was a little kid. And I've always had friends and I've always been loved, I mean, you know, probably more than some people that are just born to their parents. But I've always felt alone, I've always felt like, you know, I should maybe have more or I should be included in more things or something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, not enough a part of things.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, and I've often wondered if - I'd hate (inaudible at 0:02:29.4) to find out that it was because I was adopted because I really (inaudible at 0:02:31.8) my mom, you know. But I think maybe some of it could stem from that. I don't know, not a rejection of it or not feeling bad about it, but just something and I don't really know what it is.
COUNSELOR: And like you're saying, but, you don't really understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I don't know why. I thought maybe if I could understand why I don't like myself or get an idea somewhere, that maybe I, you know, could (inaudible at 0:03:01.7).
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. I don't think I really know what you mean when you say you don't like yourself.
PATIENT: Let's see, I don't like myself, I just basically do not like myself or anything about me. The only one thing I do like about myself is my hair. I like my hair, I think it's nice hair, the right color and just the right length and everything else. But I guess maybe I don't think there's anything attractive about me.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
0:03:32.6
PATIENT: I think that's part of it, physically or just personality wise either one.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And...
COUNSELOR: You look in the mirror and except for the hair.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, yeah, I really got a shock last night. I'm in a ski club and we've gone on a couple of ski trips. And one of the guys was taking movies, you know. And I've always taken bad pictures. And I just (inaudible at 0:03:58.6) it was the pictures, you know, I just, you know, always had crummy pictures, you know. The only picture I ever liked of me was (inaudible at 0:04:06.1) like me.
And then movies - and that someone had taken a movie of me when we were sitting down in the bar one night, on Saturday night (inaudible at 0:04:15.3). And I really - it was like the realization that all these things that I'd been saying were true. I really am ugly.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's not just you think you're ugly, you are?
PATIENT: Right, yeah.
COUNSELOR: There's the picture. Yeah.
PATIENT: And I don't know, I (inaudible at 0:04:32.5) ugly (inaudible at 0:04:36.3). And I really think that's part of it. I don't know [ph]. That's basically what's bothering me, this feeling of probably being alone and I guess I associate the feeling of aloneness because I'm not either socially accepted, physically or personality wise or something.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh, you mean, like, other people who aren't your friends don't take you in either?
PATIENT: Right, yeah.
COUNSELOR: So it's like - it's almost like there's a photograph and you look ugly. And there - well, you don't have friends, so, like, that's, like, another kind of almost objective evidence.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, right. And I know - this goes for - I think it goes with two things, it's either, like, not having boyfriends, well, that didn't bother me so much. It's a hassle, but it doesn't bother me so much as not having female friends. I mean, it's not that I don't have any, it's just that I always - well, it bothered me more when I was in high school than it did when I was in college. Well, it bothered me (inaudible at 0:05:54.6) high school and college (inaudible at 0:05:55.7) since I'm back now because I do have a couple of friends that I do do things with, you know.
0:05:58.9
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And, but in high school I had all kinds of friends when I had a car because in my sophomore year and my senior year, is the only person who had access to a car. And I had all kinds of friends, but the minute the other people would start getting cars, you know, I never got called. You know, we've got a car now, would you like to come with us? No (inaudible at 0:06:22.1).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And this made me mad because all these people I felt were my friends, you know, and I thought we just enjoyed being together and, you know.
COUNSELOR: You figured they're really after your car?
PATIENT: Right, yeah (inaudible at 0:06:30.8). And it was just that - I'm making an honest attempt trying to get somewhere in the range of being attempt but not being pushy, to make friends, you know. And I'll go out with some friends, like, in college and we'll have a pretty good time, you know. And they're going someplace and I say, "Would you mind if I come with you?" "No, fine, come with us," you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And go out and you have a good time with them. Okay, you do this several times, and as long as, you know, they say okay and they don't hesitate before they say it, you know, like, they really - they don't care. If you have a good time you think, well, now they know I'm interested, they will...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Start every once in a while - you know, we're going to the Hub, well, call (inaudible at 0:07:14.8) and see if she wants to go, no way. And I always felt, you know, this has always bugged me.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And I - and probably made it worse is that fact that all the way through high school my brother was very introverted. He had buddies calling him up all the time.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: "Do you want to go do this? Come on, Benny, let's go do this, let's go do that." "No, I don't want to." You know, and I would think after a while, you know, after a certain amount of time they know he wasn't going to go and they quit calling him. No way, you know, all the way through high school they did this.
(Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: It's something about - see, now they kept calling him and he never accepted.
PATIENT: He never went, yeah.
COUNSELOR: But did they call you?
0:07:52.5
PATIENT: No, the only time I ever get a call is from one of my girlfriends, you know, that couldn't get their father's car. "Hey, (unintelligible at 0:07:57.7), you want to go out?" "Great, where are we going?" "Well, we thought we'd go up to Joe's" or some place like that, local places that kids hang out when they're not at school. "And by the way, can you drive?" Yeah, I thought, here it comes, but I went ahead and went.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because it's - I had fun with them. Once we all got together I did have a good time, I didn't feel like I was being left out.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Like, it was I was there but I wasn't there, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And I had a good time and it was better than sitting at home.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: But (inaudible at 0:08:32.4) didn't aggravate me as much as it did my dad, you know, by somebody who'd call me up, I'm going out, can I borrow the car? You know, I knew my father would always say, "What's a matter, can't they get their own car?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:08:50.1).
COUNSELOR: Almost like, it wouldn't have been so bad if, like, he wasn't saying - if he wasn't making a fuss about it too.
PATIENT: Right, right, well, it brought it up more to me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: I would have just accepted it and put it in the back of my mind.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, right.
PATIENT: I do that, I have a convenient memory. Things that I don't enjoy, that I was unhappy about or hurt about or something, I just file under forget and forget it. But I also forget things I should remember. I don't know. But I think, like I say, it's this feeling of being alone.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:09:28.2
PATIENT: And I (inaudible at 0:09:28.8). And if I sit and logically think about it, I've got friends and they do call me and we do do things again. And I'm busy, I made sure this year. Last year I lived by myself and I was really (inaudible at 0:09:42.9). But this year I live with somebody else. I am in a ski club and I'm on a bowling team. I make sure that I'm out of the house three nights a week. I don't even have time to do any - you know, sit at home.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I still have that feeling.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it's not that you don't have people around you, it's that you don't feel valued by them.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, right. You know, like if I - you know, if I didn't show up it would be misery, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And I know that the people appreciate me because say they appreciate me, and, I mean, just make signs that are very obvious to anybody, you know, to me that I'm appreciated and they enjoy my company, and yet, still inside, I could be right in the middle of a whole entire room of all my friends and know - be able - something else that bugs me is to be in a room with people and not be able to talk to them because I don't know them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I could be in a room with people that I knew and I still feel like if I go up and talk to somebody (inaudible at 0:10:38.8), and I still feel kind of, like, you know, sitting in the corner, hiding or something. And this is - sort of things that bother me being alone, this feeling of (inaudible at 0:10:53.3). I was very more verbose about this whole thing. The other night I was really depressed. I don't know, I'm not really sure why. First of all, I'm fed up with my dad.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:11:05.1
PATIENT: And but I'm scared to go get another one [ph].
COUNSELOR: Yeah, which is hard to...
PATIENT: And I don't know, just a bunch of different things, I was really depressed. My roommate, she's done a lot to help me, really, for me to figure out some of the problems. Like, I get - I don't know how to go about solving anything or any steps. But I have a better realization of some of the things that really are bugging me, basic things that are bugging me, not just the superficial immediate things.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:11:42.3) or anything. But I started really - she told me that if I ever feel depressed, go ahead and get depressed because that's something else, all my life through no duress by my mom or anybody else, I never - my mom said she noticed it when I was a kid. And when I was a teenager, you know, when you're subject to real highs and lows?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:12:02.1), I never did that. I never get really, really happy about anything, very rarely, and at the same time, I never get really depressed about anything. I just don't let myself, you know. And I was consciously sitting there trying to get - I mean, after I started getting depressed I decided to relax and get just as depressed as I could get because Meg says that often helps.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: It really does. And I got kind of like a check and balance system. I was trying - I'm sitting there trying to get depressed and I still couldn't...
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, couldn't cry - cry (ph).
PATIENT: Which is weird too, I can cry at movies, fill a bucket but...
COUNSELOR: But you can't cry for yourself.
PATIENT: Not until recently. Something - I met a guy and it seems like every time - every other time I'm with him I feel like I'm going to start to cry. That's weird too, that I don't understand either.
0:12:58.3
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But...
COUNSELOR: Yeah, something about when you're with him - I don't know.
PATIENT: I don't know and it - and one thing is I don't really have time to (inaudible at 0:13:17.0) special. I can talk to girls chit-chatty stuff but (inaudible at 0:13:21.5) talk to men at all. I just run out of conversation, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I don't know, I have something I want to say and I don't know how to say it. I know how to bring it up. I get mad at myself and - or he does something that - you know, I'm sitting there - you know, like - it's like, I don't know what I expect out of him but I'm expecting something different than what he does, a little more or something. That's, like, I think probably another thing is that I don't really know what I'm expecting people to do for me, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: How they're supposed to, you know, show their affection for me or show their appreciation of me, but they're not doing it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's the same thing with Jay, you know, I wish he'd do something else but I'm not real sure - I mean, if I even to myself say, I wish he'd do this.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you just want something without knowing what it is.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's a - I think it's some kind of an affection, it's a wanting of affection, which I got lots of when I was a kid. I mean, I wasn't deprived, my parents didn't beat me or anything. We did stuff together all the time. (Inaudible at 0:14:27.6) taking a psychology course - the biology course, heal myself. But I really don't know how to go about combating this feeling. I don't know where to start.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
0:14:44.5
PATIENT: That's the reason I came here. I don't know (inaudible at 0:14:46.4) again. And that's all I think of right now (inaudible at 0:14:54.0) really what bothers me.
COUNSELOR: And, like, even now right now, you laid it out and, like, you don't know where to start on it in your life. And also, like, where do you start on it here?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. And just ran out of things to say.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Do you mind if I smoke?
COUNSELOR: No.
PATIENT: No.
COUNSELOR: That funny look on my face was envy because I quit last September.
PATIENT: Yeah, so that I'd like to - you know, to do (inaudible at 0:15:35.8), something else I'd like to do is go on a diet. I started so many diets, I just can't stick with them. Again, and this, I figure part of this too, my mother thinks I'm crazy. She thinks I'm just - I've just thought of an excuse not to go on a diet. But I would like to lose weight.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But in the back of my mind I've - you know, people have said, you know, well, (inaudible at 0:16:00.5) you lose weight, fine, you know. But I have this - my mom thinks I'm crazy but I really think it's true. It's not just an excuse, that in the back of my mind I'm saying to myself, well, fine, you could lose, you know, so much weight that you could turn sideways and disappear you'd be so skinny and look really nice. And then what would you do if people still didn't recognize you?
COUNSELOR: And, like, you wouldn't even have anything you could pin it to.
0:16:24.5
PATIENT: Right, yeah, you know, I've always got the excuse, well, it's because of my weight, you know, especially the excuse for why I don't get along with men, you know. I don't have zillions of boyfriends like I should have or something. I don't know. But it's, like, you know, well, then wait a minute, what if I go ahead and lose all this weight and then that wasn't the problem in the first place?
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then what do I do, you know? So now I...
COUNSELOR: And then you feel really lost.
PATIENT: Yeah, and so now I've still got an excuse, you know. And I don't know. And (inaudible at 0:17:03.4), you know, I mean, and then this problem I have of being anxious as far as men are concerned. I really - my brother - I'm going with this guy, I met him in November or December, November - end of November. And we went out New Year's Eve and he came over the house New Year's Day and so, met all my family and everything. And my brother said to mom the other day on the phone, he says, "I know what Susan's problem is, she's just too anxious." And, like, I know that and I really like (inaudible at 0:17:40.0).
And so I decided, you know, that I'm going to be a little more reserved (inaudible at 0:17:45.0). Except, you know, in not trying to make the same mistakes that I've made with other boyfriends that I've had, you know, is exactly what do I do and what do I not do, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When are you being pushing and when are you just being - you know, showing that you care?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When, you know, (inaudible at 0:18:04.8) I mean, being pushy and when you're being considerate. I don't know. If I really could ever - if I ever really knew what I had done wrong with other men I could probably help a little more. But it's really so hard because I'm just the way I am. You know, if I'm anxious, I'm anxious.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I'm excited about it, I'm excited about it and I'm going to be anxious. And I have to sit there and think - if I want to go over and talk to him, you know, I have to say, no, you stay here and let him come to you because that's the way it's done, I'm going to be miserable. And there's no way I could be happy in a relationship with a guy unless I can just be me, you know.
And my mom say, "Well, try to find a happy medium." So I've been trying, but I still - I feel uncomfortable.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Because I just want to, you know...
COUNSELOR: It isn't natural to you?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, because I'm pushy I guess. And yet, at the same time I don't want a man that I can just push around. I don't want a guy like that either. I want a guy - you know, I don't want a guy that I can push, which is kind of difficult to find a guy that you can push but will push back I suppose or something.
0:19:09.8
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm. But the way that you are naturally, like sort of spontaneous and sort of like real direct doesn't seem to be what's called for, for being with guys.
PATIENT: Right. I never was very good at being a girl, never have been. Got to be more devious, I can't do that, that's so phony. I never could do that. Not that I'm that real but I just can't be that phony on purpose.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Do you think I have a problem or do you think it's all in my head? I mean...
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Well, no, but I mean, I know I haven't got a huge problem, that (inaudible at 0:20:03.9) commit to anything, you know. But I mean, do you think it's something that's just - that can be helped in any way or is it something that I have to live with? Is it - I can't...
(Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: That kind of question is, like, you know, I don't know. It's not the kind of thing that I can answer for you.
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: I mean...
0:20:36.5
PATIENT: But I (inaudible at 0:20:37.9) different things that I could do, you know, like just sitting back and obviously saying, now, look, you're wrong, you are appreciated.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: You can tell, you can just see.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Even though you can't feel it in your mind or whatever, you can tell just by people's reactions. But it doesn't help, I still feel so - I think - I don't know, it's just feeling alone all the time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And everything else stems from that. I don't know how to combat it in my mind or where to go - how to start.
COUNSELOR: Well, you're feeling alone all the time. That's basic (inaudible at 0:21:26.1). What am I asking you about? What's that like?
PATIENT: Well, what's it like to be alone all the time?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Miserable, it really is. I found - to keep from being alone, basically to keep from being depressed I have - when I lived by myself especially, I spent 99 and nine-tenths percent of my time when I wasn't at work in a fantasy world. You know, just daydreaming (inaudible at 0:21:59.1) fantasized of dreams and stories and plots, you know, I wasn't even in, just - and I watch television a lot and just nothing constructive or useful. I go on binges every once in a while where I go out and buy something creative to do, different, you know, something to paint or something - and I'd get maybe started. Some of these things I didn't get started I just spent the money for, and I still got them in the closet somewhere.
COUNSELOR: You keep moving, you keep yourself occupied.
PATIENT: I always revert back to my safe little fantasy world because there I know nothing could go wrong.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:22:37.5
PATIENT: And, you know, I can't - I will never fail in my fantasy world and it's a lot easier. Still, sometimes - I don't know, I just - I don't know I just - I like to be around people. And I like to be around people lots, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I'd like to be - I don't know, not really a social life but I like to go to places like Joe's and be able to sit and talk to people and know people in there, just be able to walk in and know people. But of course, going to Joe's, you have to, like, go to school here or go in there an awful lot to meet the people in there. But down at school, you know, I could walk in and I knew most of the people, and most of the people knew me, but I really couldn't go in and just talk to them.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, it was, like, 90 percent of the time I know that I could - if I'd walk up and say, "May I talk to you?" They'd say fine, they wouldn't be bothered, and I could sit down and talk to them, but I can't do it.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: I always feel like, well, you know, they might say yes but then I'd really be interfering, you know, or something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is that an avocado?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:23:48.4) I was trying to remember what it was and I just couldn't remember. Do you start it from a seed?
COUNSELOR: Somebody else did.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:23:56.6) back in Maine my mom had it growing all over the house.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She's (inaudible at 0:24:01.0) anyway.
COUNSELOR: You were talking about, like, not wanting to be interfering?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, I don't want to inflict myself upon anybody that doesn't, you know...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't want to push my - I don't know, I guess I just have the feeling that people should come to me, but you got to meet people halfway. And so I - then what happens is I completely (ph) once in a while just - I'll keep going meeting people, you know, further than half way. Then every once in a while I just stick my head out too far and I just kind of pull it back and stay in my shell for three or four months, because I realize that, you know, I'm doing all the going out and nobody's coming in.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:24:46.9
PATIENT: I mean, you know, I'm going all the way out to meet somebody, and I just have no reciprocation at all.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and, like, hey, wait a minute, what's happening, you know?
PATIENT: Yeah. Because I don't - you know, it's like, if I want to go someplace, you know, like, I still get the feeling sometimes, you know, if I want to go someplace, to a bar or something like that, you know - this girlfriend where the ski club is, is a bar. And (inaudible at 0:25:18.3) it was formed, we formed it because all the people - there's about 140 of those people who go to this one bar who are interested in skiing, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: We've been talking about it, you know. So we just got together and formed a ski club and it's most of the people who go to this bar and their friends who'd got in. And, you know, still, if I want to go to the bar and call her up and say, "Are you going tonight?" And she says fine, you know, "I'll meet you there, fine," you know. And yet, there are some times where she's going - when I'm there and she's there, we both have a good time. I don't bother the least bit [ph] and get along well. And I'll call her up and I'll saying, "Are you going?" And she says, "Yes, I'm going." And I said, "Well, you know, I'll meet you there, all right?" She says fine, we have a good time. But I just wonder why doesn't every once in a while when she knows she's going, and she knows that I like to go, why doesn't she call me up and ask me if I'm going and if I'd meet her there, you know?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and since she doesn't, what does that mean and, like...
PATIENT: Right, why not, you know, why wouldn't she? We have a good time together, we enjoy each other's company, she respects me as a person I know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So then why if I go out all the time, why doesn't somebody come in? And that's the other thing that bothers kind of all my life. And this is - this is - it's aggravated by the fact that my brother - everybody used to call him and he never would go. You know, he'd never do anything with his friends.
COUNSELOR: What would it mean to you if someone called you?
0:27:11.3
PATIENT: If somebody called me?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, has this girlfriend said, "Hey, you know, let's go?"
PATIENT: It (inaudible at 0:27:16.6) fantastic, it really would.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: I mean, you know, I just - even if I didn't want to go, I'd go, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I was tired and just couldn't even walk or talk or see straight, you know, I'd make it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's almost, like, it would bring tears to your eyes almost.
PATIENT: Well, yeah, if I cried it would probably. It would really make me happy because, you know, it's, like, somebody knows I exist.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and you're not sure anybody does.
PATIENT: Right, yeah. The same thing with Jay, you know, Jay and I have a fantastic time together. We're slowly getting closer. I really - I don't know how to go about finding out - that's another thing, you know, about who Jay really is, you know, I mean, to know him just as a person.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: One thing I think is part of growing up or getting older or what, is the fact that I never really cared before, I never even thought about it, you know, but now I worry about it, that I don't know how to go about finding out who he really is, you know. What kind of questions to ask or just play it be ear, you know. It's something you have to play be ear, you can't plan an attack, well, on Tuesday night I'm going to find out this.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
0:28:23.9
PATIENT: I really don't, you know, read situations that well with people, that - you know, that one subject following something else that I'd really be interested in knowing or what. But Jay is the same way, and I'm doing the pushing. But it's just like I go ahead and do it because first of all, I know he doesn't mind. If he doesn't want - if I suggest something he doesn't want to do, he won't.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, but I get tired of suggesting it but I don't have - if I wanted to stay home alone, I wouldn't have to suggest it. Like, we always like pinochle and I was out to my parents' house last night. And my father says, "Listen, why don't you and Jay come over Saturday night and play pinochle with us?" Because he knows we're both broke. And we have a lot of fun sitting around my parents' house playing pinochle with them or cribbage or something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's a cheap date and we'd still be together and have a good time, you know. And I thought to myself, "Well, I really shouldn't do it." You know, I really shouldn't keep inviting him over and let him invite me somewhere sometime first, you know, every once in a while. And - but after I saw that film I was really depressed. And I couldn't decide whether to, you know, to free him from his - the horror that he knew or just to...
COUNSELOR: I didn't understand that.
PATIENT: Well, I really - I thought...
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Yeah, after I saw the film last night, the pictures of the ski trip, the two pictures of me, I'm thinking....
COUNSELOR: Oh, I see.
PATIENT: I started to wonder, I think, I wonder if Jay is nearsighted, you know, if he doesn't care. Then I got to thinking, well, no, Jay is a nice looking guy and he's got fairly good taste because I saw - I know a couple of the girls he used to go out with and I like them. And so I decided that probably I'm just not as ugly as I looked in the picture.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, this helped a lot and what I was trying to decide, I couldn't decide - I knew first of all that I shouldn't push him. He wants to go out Saturday night he would have asked me by now. But that's not always true with Jay.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: You know, I mean, like, I don't know what he would do because I've never given him enough chance. I've never just sat home and waited for him to decide to call at five o'clock on Saturday night and say, "Hey, you want to go bowling?" You know, I can't wait that long. I want...
COUNSELOR: You want to know, you want to know.
PATIENT: You know what, Thursday night is soon enough to ask, you know. But right now in the situation that we're in, like, all of us are - both of us and all the kids in the club are saving our pennies and our nickels and dimes for these ski trips, you know. And we don't have any extra money. I got rent to pay, Jay has got car payments to pay. And he lives at home. And so I decided he really hasn't got enough money to ask me to go out.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
0:31:19.0
PATIENT: And we get along well enough that - well, he took me out for a sandwich, like, after the club meeting last night. And so I figure, you know, if he wanted to go out he would because he didn't even have to ask me out or anything, you know. I didn't even wait for him to leave, I just said, "Listen, I'm going to go, I'll see you, bye-bye," you know. And kind of followed me out the door, I didn't ask him to, you know, which helped a lot. He knew I was complaining to Josie about this picture, my girlfriend, Josie because I'm sitting there getting more and more upset, you know. And she saw me out of the corner of her eye, she said, "What's the matter?" "There's nothing the matter, I'm fine", you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She said, "You're upset about something, what is it?" And this is the kind of thing also, you know, somebody sees me upset and walks over and says, "Why are you upset?" This is another obvious thing that I realize, that people do care if I'm upset or not. I do have friends. And yeah, I still feel the same way.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, last night, like, Josie walked over to you and Jay did follow you, but somehow, it's almost as if it's getting so far but it didn't sink in all the way.
PATIENT: Right, right. And I was - and he asked Josie what I was upset about and Josie told him. And so when we were eating dinner - we were having a sandwich after the meeting (ph), he said - he said something about it and I said, "Oh, well, I've already decided, you know, that the picture just wasn't a good picture of me." He said film just can't capture my innate beauty, you know. And then I said, "Right, Jay." He said, "Now, listen," he says, "I can knock you all I want to but you can't knock you," you know.
0:32:51.3
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: And this made me feel good. But, I don't know. So last night was a good night and a bad night.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I don't know, like - so I asked Jay - anyway, back to (inaudible at 0:33:06.4). I finally decided to go ahead and ask him if he'd come over Saturday night after he asked me out to have a sandwich, because I decided he didn't have any money. I knew he was broke, and he could always say no, you know, he doesn't have to say yes - doesn't want to come.
And so he's coming, I don't know what time. He has to call me and find out. I didn't know what time so I didn't tell him. (Inaudible at 0:33:41.0) I remember it was an example (inaudible at 0:33:45.2).
COUNSELOR: I forget too.
PATIENT: (Inaudible at 0:33:55.5).
COUNSELOR: What was it about - was an example of (inaudible at 0:34:04.4)?
PATIENT: I think it was - I started out something about, oh, being pushy with Jay I think.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Or something like that, is the fact that I knew that I shouldn't ask him, you know. I mean, I knew that I should just wait but I couldn't do it because I wanted to see him. And he has the option to say no. Because I just say, listen - talking to my dad, he said, he wanted me to ask if you'd like to come over and play cards Saturday night, you know, and he could say yes or no. I'd ask him only once and I wouldn't have asked him again.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:34:41.0
PATIENT: I probably still shouldn't have done it, it's not proper etiquette, not the way to trap a man. (Inaudible at 0:34:49.3).
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, (inaudible at 0:34:51.8), no, really, you don't like proper etiquette, and so...
PATIENT: Well...
COUNSELOR: (Inaudible at 0:34:58.7).
PATIENT: Well, it's not proper etiquette, it's devious etiquette. It's not proper etiquette.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: There are socially acceptable ways to trap a man, but they're all devious. And, you know, as far as proper things, you know, that you do say or don't say to somebody's grandmother or something like that, I go along with all that. I'm nice to grandmothers and dogs and stuff like this.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But this conniving, you know.
COUNSELOR: It doesn't fit you.
PATIENT: I don't know if it doesn't fit me because I can't do it, or if I can't do it because I don't enjoy it or what, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I like to think that I can't - I just - you know, I just wouldn't do it even if I could. But that's not true, probably would try it a couple of times if I had the art. So funny, I (inaudible at 0:35:53.4) this girlfriend with him (ph), she's basically a nice kid, I liked - there have been times when I wouldn't want to talk to her (inaudible at 0:36:04.7) in. But I like her basically as a person. But she can do some of the rattiest things to the guy she's going with, and they take it. She doesn't even have to be going with the guy, she could just have him as a friend, he'll come over to visit her - the guys are always dropping by her house all the time just to visit, not because they're going with her, they don't date her. You know, they just enjoy, you know, doing things with her.
And still jump (ph) over to her house and she'll - before they're through, she will have talked them in to helping her clean her house, wash her dogs and wash dishes, you know. And they keep coming back.
0:36:41.3
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she can talk a guy - with just asking him once and then doing anything in the world. And I just think, you know, gee, if I could get a guy to do half the things she can get a guy to do.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I don't know what it is that she's got. She's - she's...
COUNSELOR: How does she do that?
PATIENT: Right, I don't know. And it's not something she works at. I mean, it's just something - and Josie is very aggravating. These guys are always aggravated at her, always mad but they do it anyway.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, they'll do nothing - they'll go over there and end up helping her do something, you know, and the next time you see them they'll do - you didn't even know they were there, the next time you see them they do nothing. They gripe about what they had to do when they went over to Josie's house, you know, instead of not going back, they just keep going back. That's what I don't understand.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:37:31.9
PATIENT: And these are guys that she's not dating, these are just friends of hers. And the things she can get the guy she's dating to do is fantastic, you know. It's really weird and this is something, you know - it's the same thing, I don't know how she does it.
COUNSELOR: What has she got?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, what does she got?
COUNSELOR: Like, she must have something built in that you haven't got.
PATIENT: Right, right, it's just aggravating (ph). I figure I ought to be able to come up with something on my own that's just as good as hers, but I don't know where to start. If I could think of a really good asset that I had personality wise or something, but I can't. About the only asset I have is I can sit and talk for hours and not say a thing, and that's not always an asset, but I can do that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and what's serious about that is, like, you're not sure that - that you don't feel like you do have anything that will draw people to you.
PATIENT: Right, yeah. I used to - something I've slowly gotten away from that I used to do badly before, that I'm not really sure how I got myself away from it, I guess just consciously or something, unconsciously, consciously...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is I used to talk really loud because that was something - this is again the feeling of being on the outside looking in. And when I was a little kid I had friends and we always did stuff together, you know. But I'd start to say something and, you know, I'd be with three or four people, and all my life this has happened - I'll start to say something and somebody else will start to say something.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Right in the middle of what I'm saying and (inaudible at 0:39:12.5) right, you know.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: In the middle - maybe what I have to say is only two sentences long, interrupt me right in the middle of it and just start talking and everybody listens to them as if I wasn't even there.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah, I was just thinking of that.
PATIENT: You know, and this has happened all of my life, it's like I'm not there. Unless I'm with one person by myself, you know. I mean, a group of people with my friends, I'm like, you know, low man on the totem pole, the least necessary person there. And so consequently, I used to talk very, very loud because I would just continue after a while - this happened enough, I was just continue talking, you know, and just get louder and louder and louder. And I got to the point where I was just practically shouting all the time. My mother would say, "Don't talk so loud, we can hear you, you know, we're not on the moon" or something like that.
0:40:03.2
COUNSELOR: But it was, like, you had to talk so loud to get them to hear you.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, because they wouldn't listen (inaudible at 0:40:10.4) because I had to talk over who else had interrupted me. But - I mean, and it is something that's obvious. Now whether this is caused by the fact that maybe I talk too much. And so when somebody else finally got a word in edgewise, or maybe, you know, they would listen to them, or maybe it's because, like I say, I can talk chitter-chatter but don't really have anything important to say. And so if somebody else had something to say they would switch their field of interest, you know, to listen to what they had to say because they knew that maybe I'd gone on for hours and not say anything.
I don't know if it was something like that, if it was just - you know, that's a nice logical explanation that makes you feel better. But I don't know what it is. I know I can - I mean, looking back and retrospect, I really can't say.
COUNSELOR: But the feeling it gave you was that they really didn't care whether you were there or not?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. And they didn't - you know, as long as - they listened to me as long as nobody else was talking.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The minute they had a chance to listen to somebody else, they would. Out of things to say again.
COUNSELOR: I must be funny to talk to because I'm kind of quiet and sort of waiting for you.
PATIENT: Yeah, you sit there waiting for me to say something and I can't think of anything else to say.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: I'm talking (inaudible at 0:42:12.9). Just a second, I can think of words - words to start out, I'm not very good with words. I was talking to my roommate the other night about something I wanted to talk to Jay about. And I really can't get started in talking about it. I don't know, I just lost my train of thought.
COUNSELOR: It's like some kind of hump to get over.
PATIENT: Right, and I can't - I have trouble talking to men in the first place anyway, you know, except just to - you know, if I could carry on a conversation, if I could think of something to ask (inaudible at 0:42:57.7) walking in my local tavern, my favorite bar and see people that I know, you know, and I can walk up and I say, hi, how are you? Fine, how are you, you know?
COUNSELOR: And that's it, I can't think of anything else to - unless I know that they specifically have some project going, you know, that I know about that they've talked about, you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: I can walk in and ask Josie how her dogs are, and Alicia, how work's going because she's been having trouble at work, or I could ask - and talk - ask Jay lots of things because I know more about Jay than I do about anybody else, you know. But I really, you know - after I say, hi, you know, how are you, then I really have nothing else to say, you know, and then I guess (inaudible at 0:43:33.2), hi, how are you? Fine, how are you? And then I kind of fade off into nothing, and then they'll walk away because I really have nothing, you know, interesting to say, and which I could understand.
0:43:42.3
But I really - talking to people is an art, you know, it comes - the more you know about somebody the more you can - nothing more than - the more questions you can throw at them when you first see them, you know, hi, how is your mother, your father, you know, your dog? But that kind of stuff is not that interesting, you know, unless - one - you know, like, if you have somebody, somebody has a big project going. You know, like this one friend of mine has a boat that he's been working and building. Well, you know, that's something he enjoys talking about, you know. So you can ask him questions if it's something he enjoys talking about or she enjoys talking about. (Inaudible at 0:44:35.3).
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right. That was the same person and didn't realize that it wasn't six yet.
PATIENT: Oh, know what (ph) (inaudible at 0:44:46.3) with people is difficult, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I never - I could talk about myself for hours, that's no problem at all. But talking about something else, unless I specifically know something they're interested in.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The only thing I know to do is - there's two things you can do, walk in and start talking, boy, did I have a rough day today, you know, tell them a sob story or something.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or something interesting that happened to you.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:45:13.0
PATIENT: But I realized listening to Alicia-Alicia's brother had an accident Christmas Day in his car, Eve in his car. And we were in the Three, which is a place we go. The next night - and I heard the same story so many times. Every time somebody came in I heard this story from Alicia. I was getting really bored with it, you know, and I realized, you know, things like that, tell them once or twice, you know. But sob stories or even happy stories get boring.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And so I didn't really know what to talk about unless I can ask them specifically they have interested (ph) or for something - you know, one or two people have something they're really - some real big gripe. One thing is a little more to talk about, extends the conversation about two and a half minutes beyond, hi, how are you, is the club.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: People who have gone on the ski trips, you know. This week I walked in, my conversation was can't thin of anything else to say, you know. I should be able to think of something, but - how are you? Fine, how are you? How was your week, you know, how long did it take you to recover from the ski trip, you know?
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: Did you get your pictures developed yet, things like this, you know? That's - that draws about two and a half minutes as I said and then...
COUNSELOR: And then?
PATIENT: And then I have nothing...
COUNSELOR: What next?
PATIENT: Right, and this - because I really have nothing to contribute until somebody else starts a conversation, then the chances of me having something to contribute to the conversation are increased.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, once somebody starts a subject of conversation.
PATIENT: Right, you know, it's like a - and then - then, this is when the kid (ph) gets going, the subject of conversation I have something to say on, forget it, the floor is taken, it's mine until I'm finished.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right, yeah. Once you get started, you know, you're doing fine but it's getting into something that starts you.
PATIENT: Right, and it's all - I don't know. (Inaudible at 0:47:13.4) how did I get on that one?
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like - it sounds like part of the trouble is not wanting to make a mistake, not wanting to tell the same story twice, not want to rattle on too long about something they're not interested in.
PATIENT: Um-hmm. Well, I'm really worried about these kind of mistakes. Not wanting to make mistakes is right because (inaudible at 0:47:44.5) of them just accidentally without doing it on purpose. But these kind of mistakes I'm more worried about is because these are the things that I have caught myself doing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:47:57.6
PATIENT: These are things that I know that I do, given half a chance I will do them. I do not feel that I do them as bad as I did when I was, like, in high school.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Even further back to grade school. But all of this rattling on once I get the floor, once I get the, you know, the center of attention, you know, talking loud and everything, all of it stems from this feeling of being not accepted, being alone. And...
COUNSELOR: It's kind of like you're demanding to be accepted or something.
PATIENT: Right, it's what you can't do in working with people, you just have to - you know, I went through a period where I thought, well, going to let them come to me for a while and they didn't and I knew they wouldn't. You know, going to be myself and let them accept them from me, except me for me. You know, there's got to be people in the world who are going to accept me for me, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:48:45.4
PATIENT: Like, they're all phonies and I'm not or something, you know. And that didn't happen either. There are a few people, you know, I do have friends. I am not completely alone in the world. But...
COUNSELOR: You don't want me to think of you as sort of this friendless little...
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: I don't want you to think of me in the way - an island in a sea of people or anything. But I don't know, I just - I have a feeling maybe there should be more people or something. I don't get the satisfaction of, you know - I want my phone to ring, you know, 17 times at night or something like that, I mean, that would (inaudible at 0:49:25.5).
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: Probably get upset if they did, you know. Don't call me anymore.
COUNSELOR: You'd like to feel appreciated and special.
PATIENT: I just like to know that people know that I exist.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But this is something - still, this being alone, this feeling of aloneness which is really what it is goes back as far as I can remember. All the way back - I can remember - I can't remember much of what happened, like, in the first grade or the second grade. But I do remember this feeling of being alone.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't remember it when I was in kindergarten, but I remember it back that far. I don't think I remember about being - I mean, I don't remember specific instances in the first grade or the second grade or anything.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My brother remembers - he swears he (inaudible at 0:50:19.8) before he was born, he remembers far back when he was a little kid, incidences. I don't have that good of a memory. But I do remember the feeling, the feeling goes back. As far as I can feel back to the first grade. And I don't trace it back and my feelings (inaudible at 0:50:37.6). And I don't know - nothing really strange, you know, happened at that time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:50:48.7
PATIENT: But it could be...
COUNSELOR: Been with you so long.
PATIENT: This is one of the reasons - probably like I say, I've been - I have known that I was adopted. This is something, and I wonder if this could be it. I have known that I was adopted ever since I was - I can remember knowing anything. I've always known that I was adopted. But I think...
COUNSELOR: You didn't belong to your family naturally.
PATIENT: Yeah. But I've never - I've always felt kind of, you know, I mean - most people when they're adopted, they wanted children. Children who are adopted are wanted because parents - especially when my parents adopted me, it was almost 21 years ago. Well, they would have started the process more than 21 years ago. It was not that easy to adopt children just to adopt them, besides the social pressures. My parents' friends, you know, you don't know who, you know - you get an illegitimate kid whose father was a gangster and whose mother was a slut or something, you don't know what you're getting, you know, don't adopt children, you know, just...
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm.
PATIENT: And since they had a lot of pressures on them, so I really know they really wanted kids.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And besides that, there were so many extra kids more than parents at the time.
COUNSELOR: Yeah,
PATIENT: You know, you didn't walk in and - you know, we have a baby for you that was just born that we can give you if you want it, you know. She had a choice of - my mother had a choice of three - they wanted a girl so she had a choice of three girls at one time, you know.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which make even more special because she picked me.
COUNSELOR: She picked you.
PATIENT: Right, and they have a choice of three, you know, after waiting all that time. So - and like I said, we've always done things together. We've always had a good time. The only time that I don't really feel alone - except, like, on Saturday nights when everybody's out and I'm home, I might wish that I could go out or something. But I'm always retreating. My parents (inaudible at 0:52:41.9) whenever I get lonely or anything, I just go out to my parents' house. And I might get depressed, but I don't feel lonely anymore.
But - and my mother is never - like, it's not that I'm tired to her apron strings or anything. I say (ph), the feelings go back before anything like that would happen. And as a matter of fact, I was perfectly willing after I graduated from college to live at home. My mother said no, uh-uh, too many parents who have problems with their kids living at home. And too many kids have problems living at home. She said, "Why don't you just go get yourself an apartment?"
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Which is (ph) - my mom's cool in thinking about things like that.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, right.
PATIENT: Most mothers won't do that.
COUNSELOR: Wouldn't think that, yeah.
PATIENT: Right, and so she's pretty cool that way. And my dad, he agreed until it came time for me to leave. He said, "I think that's an excellent idea," you know. And then I told him, "Dad, I'm going to get an apartment." "Why don't you wait?"
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My mother said, "No, do not wait."
COUNSELOR: Did that make you feel appreciated?
PATIENT: Yeah, it did, I mean, I didn't feel like I was being thrown out. My mother appreciated that I'm - it's time for me to be on my own now, you know. I'm supposedly nearing adulthood and should be making my own way. Of course, then if I, you know - if I - you know, I'll go out one weekend and wait two weekends to go back out again (inaudible at 0:54:00.5) on Sunday afternoons (inaudible at 0:54:01.2), it's been so long since I've seen you. This has slowly gotten worse since I'm slowly getting older, you know.
When I first moved away, you know, I came out, you know, one week and come back three weeks later, the first thing she says, "You back already?"
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm.
PATIENT: Now if I don't come on every other weekend, "It's been so long since we've seen you." But I think maybe this feeling - I went to kindergarten, but it didn't - like I said, I don't feel the feeling of being alone so much then. I always - but in the first grade something could have happened, the realization that I've always been quick, you know, to say I'm adopted because this has been a pride point for me. I mean, I don't say, I'm Susan Miller, I'm adopted.
COUNSELOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I mean, I've always been fast to say it, I haven't been slow to say it.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it isn't like a secret you don't tell people.
0:55:02.6
PATIENT: I had this one girlfriend that I grew up with (inaudible at 0:55:05.3) that she and I were fairly close, we went to a lot of places together. We went to the ski lessons together and stuff. We weren't best friends or anything, we knew each other. We were in the same classes and everything all the way through grade school. And it wasn't until I was 14 years old that I found out she was adopted too. And she's never told me.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And she knew that I was adopted.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I don't know, I must have been fast to say I was adopted or something and - when I was, like, in the first grade meeting these new kids, and realized that everybody - nobody else was or something.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you were different.
PATIENT: Right, and I don't know. Because I went to - I really wasn't that out of place because I went to a Catholic school my first year and there was - the only one Catholic school in the whole entire town. It was a large town. So people were sending their kids to Catholic schools. The kids weren't going to school with the kids that lived next door to them when they'd been playing with for three or four years while they were, you know - or they became of school age. They were all in a new situation, you know. And I still was out of place.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I remember eating lunches by myself. And I didn't like the school in the first place. And I liked my teachers. I don't remember - I really don't remember - I remember having my mom deliver me to church. You had to go to church before you went to school. I remember my mom delivering me to church in the morning before classes started. And I'd sit in the pew by myself for church, didn't really have any friends that I played with at all.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, I'd go home and play with my friends from the neighborhood after school.
COUNSELOR: But you were a stranger in the school?
PATIENT: Right, and all the other kids were too but I just didn't form any friends.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'd grown up with one other girl who was a year older than I was. And we'd always played together, I'd never had to make adjustments, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
0:57:09.5
PATIENT: She was (inaudible at 0:57:10.3), she was there, we always played together because we were the only two girls in the neighborhood. And I never had to adjust to meeting new people, and I guess I didn't know how or something. And then to make matters worse, right in the middle of my freshman - of my first year in school when I was, you know, a first grader, we moved out of my old neighborhood into a new neighborhood. So not only did I not know anybody at school...
COUNSELOR: You didn't know anyone at home either.
PATIENT: Right. And but when I went to second grade, I went to a public school which is in the area. And ever since then I knew I had friends I played with. We played in school and I always was with a group of people. But I always felt like I was, like, on the fringes and ever since then I've felt that way.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I don't - you know - I'm tired of it.
COUNSELOR: Tired of being on the fringes?
PATIENT: Right and I think it shouldn't - I think I am still there, you know. Like, with Josie, Josie and I are good friends and we enjoy each other's company, Alicia are good friends and we enjoy each other's company. But buying (ph) something special, they just are not going to call me and say let's go to the Hub, let's go to the Quatro, let's go do this, let's go do that, they just won't do it.
What I want to do - what I want to try to do is just get my mind adjusted to the fact that, you know, enjoy it while I'm with him and don't worry about it.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm.
PATIENT: Because it doesn't make that much difference.
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm, um-hmm.
PATIENT: But I can't do that, I can even tell myself and I'll listen, you know. This won't do at all. Just...
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Making yourself unhappy for nothing.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but it still bothers you even though you try not to let it.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Meg has helped a little bit. If Meg were probably home more - she gets home late and she goes to bed. She goes to work about 6:30 in the morning. She works out in Albany selling - you know, in the Albany area up there. And then when she's through at five o'clock she's got to drive all the way back in, you know. So I feed her something and she drags herself to bed.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Gets up the next morning and does it all over again. And once in a while she'll have a extra burst of energy and we'll sit around and talk for a while, and go to Joe's for a beer or something.
0:59:31.5
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And just - the little time that I do spend with her has helped. Because - well, first of all, I've never - another thing is, I've always had, all my life, people coming to me to solve their problems, you know, (inaudible at 0:59:48.6). They always felt that I was more level headed.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And things like this, you know, more common sense or something. I would say people come to me with their problems, you know, and I'd solve them for them, you know. And try to get a reciprocal training group [ph] and listen, I'm upset about this, you know, get two words into the sentence, lost them. They're gone, you know, they're not listening.
COUNSELOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: But, you know, I mean, I have...
COUNSELOR: That's another one, like, you don't exist again.
PATIENT: Yeah, when they need help from me, you know, they know I exist, you know. This is something else I was - this was one of my pride points in high school, the only - but one of the biggest ones that I had was the fact that, fine, maybe they'd only call me, you know, when they needed my car or something like that, you know. Maybe they didn't include me in other stuff, but I know that they'll come to me when they need help.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't have to go to them they'll come to me when they need help.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When they need something, and not, like, money or a car when they, you know...
(Crosstalk)
COUNSELOR: When they got a problem.
PATIENT: When they got a problem and they want somebody to talk to, and they want somebody to help them solve it, you know. I used to be pretty good at doing that except my own problems, of course, I never was very good at that. But and so consequently, I got to the point I never would tell anybody my problems because I knew nobody would ever listen.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I had this one girlfriend who use - one time got real mad at me because she's always telling me her problems, you know. And then one night she said, "You know, you never tell me your problems," then I'd always come back with, "I don't have any problems." You know, I'm perfect or something. So one night I was really depressed and I was out at her apartment. And so I decided I'm going to tell her my problem, you know.
1:01:29.8
I must have gotten three sentences into my problem and she - and she's sitting there like she's listening, I thought, "Well, she may get upset with me after a while, she's going to listen, right?" I got about three sentences into it and she looked at me and she opened her mouth, I thought she was going to make a comment. And she asked me a question about something that was totally unrelated. She asked me if I believed in infinity or something weird like that.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I was talking about a problem that had - you know, didn't have any abstracts to go along with it or anything, you know. And so then I thought, "Well, that's it." And Meg is the first person I've been able to talk - you know, sit down and tell my problems to and she'll make comments.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She didn't have any solutions but she'll make comments and I - and put her two cents worth of ideas and stuff like that, you know. So it's helped, somebody, you know, I can...
COUNSELOR: Yeah, like, at least Meg will listen.
PATIENT: Yeah, she'll listen (inaudible at 1:02:24.0). And she'll listen and make, you know, constructive criticism or, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Her idea of what to do may not be my idea of what to do, or I may not feel like it will help but she's, you know - she sat and she listened.
COUNSELOR: At least she's trying.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, she's trying and she cares.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, that other girl, like, it must have - when she said that about infinity.
PATIENT: It blew my mind completely. I - I've been...
COUNSELOR: How could you not care at all?
PATIENT: Right, and the thing that...
COUNSELOR: How could you be that indifferent?
PATIENT: Right, and the thing that was so funny is because she had been - I even introduced it. You know, she's always saying, "How come you never tell me any of your problems? I'm always telling you mine, I want to hear some of yours, I want to be able to help you, you helped me," you know? So when I introduced it I said, "All right," I said, "You've been wanting hear my problems, I've got a problem."
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: "That's really bothering me. I want to talk about it." She said fine, you know, she said fine and I started talking and she started thinking to herself about what she was going to talk about next, wasn't even listening to the topic. And so she asked me the question, I looked at her and I started to yell at her. And I thought, "No, won't do any good." Won't do any good at all, you know, to really give it to her. And so I answered her question, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, you got off talking about infinity.
PATIENT: Something like that, infinity or stars or space or something, it was something like that, something in that area.
COUNSELOR: So you gave it up.
PATIENT: It was really funny, though, because the next time she said that to me, I said, "Mandy, I tried that once."
COUNSELOR: Um-hmm.
PATIENT: And I told her the situation and she felt kind of bad.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I still don't tell her any of my problems.
COUNSELOR: I guess you don't want to have that happen again?
PATIENT: Well, the kind of problems that she has that I try to help her with, I don't think she could help me with mine anyway.
COUNSELOR: Uh-huh, I see [ph].
PATIENT: But I just thought I'd throw them out, you know, get her opinion of (inaudible at 1:04:20.7).
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And she's got some hang-ups that she really needs help above and beyond mine.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, we should be quitting for today.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: My understanding is that we're to see each other twice a week.
PATIENT: Twice a week?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I didn't know that.
COUNSELOR: I think they need that for their research project.
PATIENT: Oh.
COUNSELOR: Is that going to be possible for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, what times would it be?
COUNSELOR: Well, you have to make it late in the afternoon, right?
PATIENT: I can make it in the daytime sometimes.
COUNSELOR: Oh, wonderful.
PATIENT: Like, early in the morning.
COUNSELOR: Oh, wonderful.
PATIENT: Like, from nine to ten?
COUNSELOR: Oh, yeah, that's okay I thought you were going to say, well, from eight to nine.
(Crosstalk)
PATIENT: I don't get up before 8:30.
COUNSELOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I talked it over with my boss and he said nine to ten would be fine.
COUNSELOR: Oh, well, that's great because, like, it gets kind of late in the evenings.
PATIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Maybe next Tuesday?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday, okay, from eight - from nine to ten?
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Good.
PATIENT: Now if we have to see each other twice a week, I can only take one - you know, like, one day off in the morning.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, and the other time would have to be...
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Late, okay.
PATIENT: He said he didn't mind one hour a week, you know.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, but, like, you don't want to push him for more than that.
PATIENT: Right, yeah.
COUNSELOR: Yeah, okay, and then we can do one, like, at 4:30 or four or whenever (inaudible at 1:05:52.3).
PATIENT: Right, yeah. Okay, all right. And should I - when I get here should I just come on up?
COUNSELOR: Well, take a look and if the receptionist down there...
PATIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: Get her to give a call but if she isn't, come on up.
PATIENT: Okay.
COUNSELOR: Do you know what to do with these?
PATIENT: No, uh-uh.
COUNSELOR: They have this box downstairs there's these two glass windows by the waiting room.
PATIENT: Um-hmm.
COUNSELOR: And in the one that's nearer the stairs there's this box behind the glass, and you have to stick this slip into the box if the window is open or just into the glass so the receptionist can write down your next appointment, so she knows when you're coming.
PATIENT: Okay, all right. Now - okay, I'll find it.
COUNSELOR: Good.
PATIENT: Is it just a box with a hole in it, right?
COUNSELOR: Yeah, it's got this little slot, it's like a shoebox or something.
PATIENT: Right, okay. 
COUNSELOR: Yeah, yeah.
