<i>Seattle, Washington</i>


Ms. S, a 34-year-old Filipina American
woman, came from a family of educators.
She had worked successfully at a community
college in Nevada but wanted less
severe weather. Ms. S interviewed and
successfully landed a job at a small-town
community college that served several surrounding
towns. She moved to this working-class
community and started with high
hopes of finding, if not a permanent home, a
home that would be rewarding for a long
time. Unfortunately, within 6 months, she
was puzzled that she did not receive the
support that seemed to be so forthcoming in
her interviews. Colleagues, previously
friendly, were more distant. She was not
informed of department parties on multiple
occasions. She tried harder to reach out, but
to no avail. She had even changed her style
of dress from blazers and trousers or skirts to
more casual clothes and grew out her hair
due to feedback that she dressed differently--looked
different from other faculty
on campus. Puzzled, because she saw her
clothing as appropriate, she was willing to
remove this as an obstacle.


Ms. S was puzzled at her difficulty connecting
with the faculty. She had fit in well
in her previous department and was able to
communicate with even some of the most
difficult people. She began to worry when
her faculty mentor for promotion and tenure
started giving her odd advice. More than a
year later, when she asked to start her tenure
review, as she was told she could when she
was hired, she felt that she was penalized for
being organized and going up for an early
review. She received embarrassing reviews
of her teaching methods, style, and content
of her courses from two faculty members

From another setting, Mr. R, a 50-year-old
African American man, had worked for the
same transit service for more than 10 years.
Evidence supported his claim that he was
respected and a good problem solver. He had
repeatedly been voted to a shop steward position
starting in his first year on the job. He
spent extra time with employees he represented.
He put in overtime, not always charging
the company. With the hiring of a new
employee whom he had helped to get a job,
racial harassment toward him started. Graffiti
with White supremacist messages appeared
on the transit vehicles and in the restrooms.
When he complained, he was told to clean it
up. A noose had appeared by the water fountain
that he drank out of each day. A death
threat note with racist language had been
slipped through a slot in his locker. He
repeatedly tried to bring these events to the
administration's attention but with little effective
intervention. He began to lose sleep,
become irritable with his family, socially
withdraw, have panic attacks, and cry on
Sunday nights in anticipation of returning to
work on Monday. He developed high blood
pressure and gained weight. He felt that he
was second-guessing the meaning of some
coworkers' actions and comments. Eventually,
his physician prescribed antidepressants and
strongly encouraged him to enter counseling.
As a last resort, he did enter counseling and,
within 2 months, came to the conclusion that
he had to take a leave from work to maintain
his sanity and restore some sense of control
over himself and his life. However, taking a
leave added to his sense of helplessness.
Eventually, he quit his job. This move, too,
was difficult. He had difficulty looking for
jobs, embarrassed that he was unemployed
and fearful of being asked why he left his last
job. He started having unpredictable panic
attacks that contributed to his reluctance to
leave his house. These symptoms started to
significantly affect his wife and children. He
felt he had failed them, which further contributed
to his depression.


Ms. S's and Mr. R's stories provide a
backdrop for looking at personal injury
psychological evaluations within a culturally
and racially appropriate manner. Both were
sent by their lawyers for an evaluation of current
functioning and possible damages associated
with the experiences they sustained in the
workplace. They had already filed lawsuits
against their former places of employment.


A typical evaluation would consist of a
review of the complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
if this occurred and its findings, a review of
the legal complaint, a review of personnel files
(including performance evaluations, memos,
corrective action memos, commendations, and
courses or trainings completed), and a review
of medical and counseling records, possible
collateral interviews, and the legal complaint.
They would likely take the Minnesora Multiphasic
Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) and
perhaps some other psychological test. In

This chapter provides theoretical explanations
for why racial and ethnic origins of
harassment in the workplace are particularly
damaging to an individual and the extent of
damage it may set in motion. It further outlines
the relevant aspects of an evaluation for
claims of this nature and the diagnoses that are
common. Without this knowledge, many typical
psychological evaluations may add injury
to possible sustained injuries associated with
the case for which the client is being evaluated,
particularly when it involves racial, cultural,
or ethnic origins of harassment. The reader
familiar with sexual harassment will find
much in common with the origins of distress
caused by racial, cultural, or ethnic origins of
harassment (O'Donohue, 1997). Race, in particular,
as with gender, often represents a master
status on which fears are projected. In
addition, a secondary class status has been
experienced that makes these individuals more
vulnerable to maltreatment in the workplace.
Allport (1954), in his classic text <i>The Nature
of Prejudice</i>, defined racism as "an antipathy
based upon a faulty and inflexible generalization.
It may be felt or expressed. It may be directed
toward a group as a whole, or towards an
individual because he is a member of that
group" (p. 9). He also observed that anti-woman
sentiments occur and survive with the
same dynamic as racism. For many women of
color who are harassed in the workplace, they
are the recipients of the intersection of racism
and sexual harassment.


With the passage of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of minority status-specif
race, sex, national origin, color, or
religion--harassment policy guidelines have
been set forth in the workplace. Nevertheless,
there has been a delay in the appearance of
lawsuits claiming racial or national origins of
color discrimination in the courts, which have
appeared in notable numbers only in the past
decade. This delay may be due to several factors,
including the fact that in 1991, the Civil
Rights Act was amended to provide the foundation
for recipients of discrimination to
legally seek relief from the problem as well as
damages (Lindermann &amp; Kadue, 1999).
Several high-profile racial suits have appeared
in newspapers across the country since the
Civil Rights Act of 1991 was amended. Some
of these suits have awarded plaintiffs significant
damages of more than $1 million (e.g.,
Haines, 1996).


The literature on racial or ethnic origins of
harassment primarily documents discrimination
against persons of African descent (e.g.,
Forman, Williams, &amp; Jackson, 1997; Mays,
Coleman, &amp; Jackson, 1999), but it extends to
all groups in which persons are deemed
racially or ethnically different. Issues of accent,
dress, type of food eaten, and language spoken
other than English at work have been used as
sources of discrimination. Loo (1994) has documented
and defined racism against Asian
American veterans in the service of their duty
assignments in the Vietnam War. Nevertheless,
the public is more familiar with the type

[p. <i>481</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00495&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Racism in the Workplace</b>

Institutional racism and discrimination do not
have to be intentional for them to have psychological
and physical consequences (Weiss
et al., 1991-1992). Defending the perpetrators
or the institutions that ignore allegations of
harassment often involves trying to suggest
that if there was no intent, harm could not
ensue or must be minimal. However, lack of
conscious malicious intentions does not clinically
correlate with the lack of significant negative
effects on one's quality of life and
psychological well-being. The consequences or
effects of harassing behavior are the focus of
the person affected. Because this type of stress
or trauma is perpetrated by a person, the
impact of such actions is greater than if one
sustained injury in an industrial accident or
natural disaster (Janoff-Bulman, 1992; Root,
1992).


Institutional racism is characterized by
practices or policies that systematically limit
opportunities for people who historically have
been characterized as psychologically, intellectually,
or physically deficient or limited in
capacity by virtue of attributes assigned or
assumed based on assumed race, ethnicity,
or ethnic origins (Katz &amp; Taylor, 1988).
Although a company harassment policy provides
an avenue for complaint and conveys a
message of expectations of respectful behavior,
it does not guarantee a harass ment-free
environment. Management must enforce policies
to make it clear that racial or ethnic origins
of harassment will not be tolerated.
Although an agency or institution may have
policies in place intended to remedy racial discrimination,
individual representatives may
nevertheless perpetuate discriminarion. If

[p. <i>482</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00496&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The evaluator must challenge several
assumptions about racial and ethnic origins of
discrimination and harassment in the workplace.
Although the behaviors that constitute
harassment may not be obvious to everyone,
particularly if they are not sensitive to its many
faces, the insidious effects of racism and discrimination
can be life changing. These experiences
are situated historically in U.S. race
relations. This history lays the foundations for
the level of seriousness that the consequences
of these types of processes, leveled at an individual,
may have (Root, 1992).


In summary, at least five assumptions must
be examined in doing an evaluation:
<table>

<p>
1. Poor treatment in the workplace, when it is
intertwined explicitly with racial comments,
even if occurring at different times but in
the same workplace, can be impossible to
separate from racial discrimination. It
appears the same, regardless of intent.

2. Some people, no matter how overt their
discriminatory or prejudiced actions may
be, will be ignorant or defensive; they will be
unwilling or unable to perceive their actions as

they may feel entitled to discriminate.

to undo racial prejudice, it still exists.

addition to their supervisory role to provide
them the status to lie and be believed over
other employees or to be perceived as more
credible than their employees may be.

clear policy against racial discrimination, it
does not preclude it or the persons representing
it from operating in ways that are
discriminatory and perpetuate institutional
racism.

<b>Examples of Harassing or Discriminatory Behaviors and Strategies</b>

Harassing behavior can range from death
threats with concomitant racially inappropriate
remarks to stereotyping. It is impossible to
provide an exhaustive list of examples to cover
a broad range of potentially infinite discriminatory
and harassing actions. Instead, common
strategies are listed with an example. At
its extreme, the combined strategies result in
someone feeling tortured while held hostage.
Although one solution is to quit the job, for
some people, these are jobs they have held for
20 years, and it is unreasonable and difficult to
think of quitting; it could be hard to find comparable
work elsewhere, particularly if one has
advanced in pay or status within the system.
These advances may not automatically transfer
to other employment.


<i>Simple discrimination</i>. This includes namecalling,
racial epithets, stereotyped imitations
of accents or vernacular speech, graffiti, racist
cartoons, and racist jokes. For example, a

[p. <i>483</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00497&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Administrative discrimination</i>. Promotions
are blocked. A less qualified White person is
selected. For example, an African American
man has been used to train the last three men
promoted ahead of him but junior to him. He
has even acted as the acting manager at various
times when the position has been vacant.


<i>Colonization strategy</i>. A more insidious
trauma is inflicted when other employees of
color are used to perform the discriminatory
actions. When a racial minority woman is
involved, she may be compared to another
minority woman whose behavior is held up as
ideal. This is the Madonna/whore contrast
used in racial stereotyping (i.e., the good
minority vs. the bad minority). For example,
an employee is told that she is not the recipient
of racial discrimination because other
minorities have been promoted. Another
female colleague of color, who is particularly
compliant, will be used as an example. It is
either said directly or suggested that the complainant
should try to be more like her. In a
different setting, an African American manager
may be used to tell an African American
employee that he or she should not be affected
by the racist actions and turn the other cheek.


<i>Low expectations</i>. Employees of color are
assigned less desirable, less challenging, or
dead-end assignments.


<i>Bystander apathy</i>. An employee is subjected to
racial jokes and racial epithets daily. These
may be directed at him or her or toward other
persons. Repeated use in the workplace can
reduce an employee's sense of safety. Vicarious
psychological injury can result from the stereotyping
as well as the diffusion of responsibility
when no one else is willing to take action
or sees a need for action. For example, a
Cambodian American man told his coworkers
that it was hurtful when people made fun of his
accent. However, no one made attempts to
stop other coworkers from this behavior.


<i>Modem racism</i>. A boss accused of discrimination
or harassment will point out that they
have hired other minorities and, in fact, done
favors for these particular employees. Dovidio,
Gaertner, Kawakami, and Hodson (2002)
described aversive racism in the workplace as
persons denying they would ever be prejudiced
and, in certain circumstances, might be helpful
in ways that support their claims. However, in
laboratory settings, the data suggest that the
subtle ways in which they behave and do or do
not take action suggest that they are uncomfortable
and may discriminate in an interracial
setting. For example, a manager may provide
some flextime to accommodate a young Latina
mother's child care arrangements. Simultaneously,
she provides messages that this employee
has limited abilities and is untrustworthy.


<i>Servant strategy</i>. An employer expects the
employee to baby-sit, do extra work, show up
to facilitate some aspect of work on days off,
and so forth, in line with a personal maid,
butler, or baby-sitter.


<i>Double standard</i>. The employee has less room
for errors. Errors count more than when a
White employee makes them. Policies of confidentiality
may be violated if negative information
is sought.


<i>Lack of training</i>. A new employee is not offered
the help offered to previous or other new
employees, so this employee's performance will
suffer and he or she will be a disadvantage in
performing the responsibilities of the job. An
employee seeking a promotion may be denied
classes, trainings, or other opportunities to keep
him or her competitive for promotions.

[p. <i>484</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00498&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Unrealistic expectations</i>. These expectations
may include meeting unreasonable deadlines
or being assigned important projects in which
failures or mistakes will be public. In this way,
the public failure will allow other people to
take over the harassment.


<i>Mischaracterization</i>. Stereotypes are imposed
on the individual, positive or negative. When
positive stereotypes exist, negative stereotypes
may emerge. An employee's reactions to reports
of racist events may then be characterized as
overly sensitive, hysterical, and dramatic. Those
who attempt to seek relief from the incidences
may be characterized as unassertive with
coworkers, overly dependent, and ineffective.


<i>Isolation</i>. Direct messages to coworkers or indirect
messages may encourage previously friendly
coworkers to avoid an employee. Subsequently,
they are threatened even more by not knowing if
they are believed and being watched or if reports
are being made on their actions.


<i>Lethal discrimination</i>. At the extreme are
death threats made verbally or in writing,
attempts to run over people or hit people with
vehicles, tampering with chemicals or equipment
in the environment, and the presence of
guns, knives, and other weapons that threaten
bodily harm or death. For example, an African
American man's anxiety escalated when an
employee who had been harassing him for
months showed up to work with a rifle in his
car and made sure that he let him know that
he hoped he "wouldn't be forced to use it."

<b>Sorting out the Sequelae to Exposure to Environments that are Racially or Ethnically Harassing</b>

If someone is diagnosed as suffering acute or
long-term harassment or discrimination, that
person is likely to fulfill a diagnosis of some
form of affective or anxiety disorder. Neither
of these disorders, however, alone or together,
can capture the full picture of those people
who have recurrent intrusive thoughts, nightmares,
and even flashbacks of work situations.
Their tendency to socially withdraw, wish to
die, or quit their line of work is not just
depression or anxiety. It is related to suffering
a trauma that rendered them tortured, helpless,
and overwhelmed by their capacity to
cope. In an interview situation, one might be
perceived as particularly reactive, even with
hysterical features, if the evaluator does not
understand the potential destructiveness of
racism. For many people, their symptoms are
captured well by posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and acute stress reaction except for
Criterion A, threat of death or bodily injury to
self or another (American Psychiatric Association,
1994, p. 427). However, when someone
has been physically threatened, he or she may
best be diagnosed with an acute stress reaction
and, after a period of time, PTSD. In this
section, conducting the assessment and understanding
symptoms are core.


<b>Approaching the Assessment</b>


The evaluator has the difficult position of
sorting out if the distress makes sense, given
the meaning of the individual's experiences to
them in the context of his or her life. The evaluator
must have the experience and the means
to sort out if the client's story and symptoms
make sense. Evaluators must place their reactions
in the context of the client's past history,
the context within which the client works, and
the meaning of being affected by the harassment
or discrimination. Most often, clients,
whether self-referred for therapy or referred by
a lawyer for evaluation, are competent, motivated
workers who take pride in their jobs and
make a point of trying to excel. They often
pursue a legal case for social justice reasons.
Although the possibility of a monetary settlement

[p. <i>485</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00499&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A frequent shortcoming of conventional
personal injury evaluations that involve
discrimination is that evaluators lack an
understanding of the political context for comprehending
discrimination in the historical
context relevant to the personal life of the
client. Agreeing that racism is uncivil and illegal
in the workplace, they may not understand
why it is important to have the clients tell their
stories about what happened to them in the
workplace. This approach to the evaluation
heightens the fear by many minority status
individuals that the evaluator does not understand
them in context and may be vulnerable
to stereotyping them. Furthermore, because
the evaluator may reflect some characteristics
of the harasser, the age, power differential in
the evaluation setting, racial status, and gender
of the evaluator may be triggers for defensive
or cautious behavior. Without awareness by
evaluators that some of their characteristics
may be triggers for increased anxiety, cautiousness,
and overgeneralization, the evaluators
may proceed in a way that compromises
their goals. It important for evaluators to
inquire or assess if the client's cautiousness in
the evaluation is possibly related to these factors.
Evaluators may want to get physical,
behavioral, and status descriptions of the persons
who have been the alleged source of
harassment or discrimination. By doing this,
evaluators have a greater context within which
to evaluate the client's defensiveness and behavior
and may decrease the defensiveness in context
rather than inadvertently heightening it.


Besides doing a standard evaluation that
obtains some family history to put an individual
in historical context, the evaluator also
needs to obtain an education history and
thumbnail sketch of work history. The meaning
of these latter two histories is sometimes more
significant if evaluators also know some of the
educational history and employment or career
history of their clients' families. This gives
some sense of the clients' expectations of
themselves and their families' expectations.
Often, tremendous guilt and depression ensue
because some may believe they have let their
family down or have let their reference group
down by being stereotyped or unable to be
strong in the face of adversity. For example, an
African American salesman was fired despite
being a top performer for several evaluation
cycles. He felt ashamed and embarrassed
because of the stereotypes of unemployed
Black men and, despite his strong work ethic,
his fear of going out for interviews for new
jobs while unemployed. His inability to cope
contradicted his sense of being a strong and
effective Black man.


It is important to remember that as the evaluator,
one's job is not to assess whether the
things they claim happened--unless there are
obvious disparities in evidence and narrative.
One determines if the clients' stories and
symptoms are congruent; if the clients are
competent to tell their stories, have sustained
harm, or might be feigning symptomatology
for secondary gain; the extent that their symptoms
are seemingly caused by the events they
report; the meaning of the events to them; how
they have tried to cope to reduce their symptoms;
and any relevant diagnoses.


The MMPI-2 is the gold standard of psychological
evaluation, but it is not appropriate
to use with persons who have grown up in a
culture that is not of European origin and
philosophy of thinking. For example, in evaluating
a man who had grown up and schooled
in Somalia through his young adult years, it
was not appropriate to use the MMPI-2. Many
of the items would have different meanings
than are typically employed, and norms do
not exist to help the interpretation of a profile

[p. <i>486</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00500&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If possible, I suggest that the interview be
conducted in two sessions. The interviews can
take from 4 to 10 hours. The length is affected
by the chronicity of events in the workplace,
the age of the client, the level of distress the
client is experiencing, and the client's style of
narration. The evaluator will listen with a critical
but compassionate stance. The interviews
must include the range of information obtained
in conventional evaluations: work history,
educational history, family background, mental
health history, alcohol and drug history,
and the meaning of what happened to the
client and his or her understanding or personal
theory of why it happened. However, in evaluating
someone who has been chronically
harassed due to his or her ethnic origins or
racial background, one must add elements to
the evaluation to form an opinion on any psychological
damages the client has sustained,
make relevant diagnosis, and estimate what, if
anything, the individual might need to do to
overcome the harm he or she has sustained.
These elements include allowing clients to tell
their stories. Clients will more often than not
spontaneously offer elements of their stories
throughout other aspects of the interview.
However, I suggest the evaluator only obtain
enough information initially to provide an
overview while reassuring the clients that they
will be able to tell their stories. This reassurance
will reduce interruptions and decrease
anxiety when the evaluator attempts to
ask clients to hold that part of the story until
later.


The first session provides contextual background
obtained in a typical evaluation
described above. With this interview, the
results of testing and a review of documentation
are discussed; the second interview is designed
to ask clients to tell their stories, parts of
which will already have emerged.


The second interview establishes diagnoses
and possible other sources of explanation or
origin for any diagnoses. Thus, this interview
must include an exploration or inventory of
the other Stressors such as assaults outside of
the workplace, relationship strife, or family
problems that have occurred in a relevant time
period that may be a likely or alternate source
of explanation for symptoms. For many persons,
telling a story of ethnic or racial harassment
must be contextualized. It can take up to
several hours to tell such a story, which may
be longer than a typical evaluation. The evaluator
is able to observe how the story seems to
affect the client, as well as any changes in composure,
emotion, language, coherence, or
organization in telling the story. Any changes
provide hypotheses to be explored.


When clients do tell their stories, there are
typically discreet events that are particularly
distressing. It can be useful to ask if there was
anything significant about how, where, or
who took the actions. What was at stake for
them, or how helpless or powerful did they
feel? Were there any witnesses? How did the
witness act? Besides asking what action was
taken to their knowledge to address this event,
it is useful to ask what their expectation was
for reporting the event. If they did not report
the event, then why not? Ask for the personal
meaning of the event. The evaluator can make
a list of discreet events and ask the client to
rate each event on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1
representing <i>slight distress</i> and 10 being
<i>extremely distressing</i>. As a way of checking
consistency and further understanding clients'
source of distress, clients can be asked to indicate
the three most distressing events to them.
Again, assessing why each of these events was
more distressing than an event with a lower
rating is informative. During this part of the
interview, there is often mere visible distress,

[p. <i>487</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00501&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The other critical element typically not
included in these types of evaluations is a
history of experiences with racism or ethnic
discrimination. This history necessarily goes
back to childhood. These experiences can be
elicited as most potent experiences, first experiences,
and experiences that are irritants but
do not feel damaging to their core. The therapist
can also explore the meaning of these
experiences and how and if they changed their
worldview, coping, or approaches to certain
situations. It is useful to find out the family
value placed on silence or speaking out about
this type of discrimination and the coping that
was imparted. Another element of this interview
is asking for the person's awareness of
what environmental cues now serve as triggers
for anxious feelings. The triggers are not always
obvious as second-order conditioning may
imbue certain people, places, actions, statements,
sights, sounds, or smells with threatening
value. Unfortunately, the consequence of
racial harassment sometimes conditions
"Whiteness" to serve as a trigger for anxiety or
intrusive thoughts because, more often than
not, White persons usually are the perpetrators
of racial harassment in the workplace.


Last, symptoms need to be assessed. It is
useful to ask when symptoms began and even
to ask for ratings on a Likert-type scale for
symptoms such as anxiousness, worthlessness,
loss of drive, anxiety, and so on. A list of 10
common types of symptom clusters are
described below that I have compiled after
years of working with persons who have sustained
harm from working in environments in
which they have been discriminated against
racially or ethnically.


<b>Ten Common Sequelae</b>


The following list of 10 symptoms has been
gleaned over 15 years of working with persons
who have specifically been self-referred for
therapy or for evaluation due to workplace
discrimination or harassment. I do not sense
that the list of symptoms is different for these
two populations. However, during litigation,
the trauma story is kept alive through depositions,
requests for documentation, meetings
with attorneys, and settlement hearings or
trial. Thus, the immediate distress may be
more obvious and sometimes more acute.


Many persons subjected to acute or repetitive
acts of discrimination experience several
of the following clusters of symptoms. Weiss
et al. (1991-1992) reported many of these
symptoms in their survey of persons who had
experienced ethnoviolence. The presence of
several of these symptoms suggests that clients
struggle against and with wounds to some core
aspect of their spirit, reputation, or psychological
defenses. Often, the harassment and discrimination
are experienced as an attempt to
destroy character. With chronic harassment, a
client may start to manifest symptoms associated
with being held hostage. Thinking about
what has happened and what might happen
next monopolizes his or her daily ruminations.
The client may wonder what he or she could
have done differently. This individual is
acutely aware of his or her harasser's actions.


For clinical purposes, I suggest that the
experience of any racism does stress an individual
at some level. Chronic racial or ethnic
origins of harassment have some lasting
impact on the causation of symptoms that
may last from months to years. One to three
clusters of symptoms below represent the low
end of psychological harm. However, if these
are Clusters 1, 3, and 4 or 7 in any degree of
moderateness, the effects are moderately
severe. Endorsing four to seven clusters usually
represents a moderate degree of psychological
harm. Experiencing more than seven of the
clusters represents severe impact. Often,
Cluster 9 is one of the last to be manifested.
Cluster 6 may be resistant to erosion for a long

1. <i>Anxiety</i>. The client may dread going to
work. This is particularly notable when the
client has been someone who has looked forward
to going to work or has derived a considerable
amount of identity from work. She
or he may experience panic attacks, bad
dreams, somatic symptoms, or an intensification
of chronic physical or mental conditions.
For example, someone with a tendency to
have high blood pressure may manifest much
higher blood pressure, blood sugar in diabetics
may be harder to control, arthritis may be
more painful and extensive, and migraine conditions
may be more frequent.


2. <i>Paranoia</i>. The client manifests extreme
self-consciousness or second-guesses others'
intentions. She or he worries about the attributions
that people make of her or him based
on race or ethnicity. Similarly, there is focus
on what misinformation people may have.
This cluster of symptoms contributes to a
desire to avoid people and makes it more difficult
to seek other employment in the same
city. Some clients may find themselves changing
their routines of places they frequent such
as the grocery, car wash, or church because of
their extreme self-consciousness and worry
about what other people might know and
what misinformation they might believe.
These symptoms are particularly acute in persons
for whom the harassment is made public
through news spots on television or radio or in
published stories. She or he starts to fear a loss
of positive reputation or fears damage to an
otherwise neutral or positive reputation.


3. <i>Depression</i>. The following are symptoms
of a major affective disorder for which
the person may qualify: social withdrawal
from friends, family, or pleasurable social
activities; difficulty getting out of bed; difficulty
keeping up with responsibilities and chores (or
an awareness that accomplishing things feels
exhausting); fatigue; and irritability. In general,
a person may feel exhausted keeping up
with life. At its extreme, one may wish to die
to be relieved of misery and to relieve their
families of the ripple effects or the toll their
misery or unemployment takes on the family.


4. <i>Sleep Difficulties</i>. Although difficulty
sleeping is a symptom of depression, it is considered
a separate cluster because it is often
one of the first symptoms. One may have difficulty
falling or staying asleep or may wake
up early. Often in trying to sleep, racing or
intrusive thoughts persist about past events or
anticipation of the next day of work.


5. <i>Loss of Confidence</i>. Previously confident
people lose confidence in their ability to
trust and evaluate people. Without this confidence,
many interpersonal interactions
become that much more difficult, which can
increase anxiety in interpersonal interactions.
This is particularly significant if someone's job
has entailed interacting with the public, supervising
people, or doing public relations work.


6. <i>Worthlessness</i>. This worthlessness
reflects a loss of confidence in one's value or
competence as a worker despite evidence to
the contrary. This symptom cluster can reflect
an extreme sense of humbleness to the extent
that one truly believes he or she may have
nothing to offer and is totally replaceable.


7. <i>Intrusive Cognitions</i>. Involuntary
obsessional, intrusive replays and recollections
of meaningful events are unpredictable at
times and draining. Sleep may provide little
escape from these intrusions, which may manifest
in bad dreams or nightmares. intrusions
may impair work performance. The energy to
stop intrusions may leave one more exhausted
at the end of the day. Simply being at work,
meeting deadlines, going to meetings, having

[p. <i>489</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00503&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

8. <i>Helplessness</i>. Feelings of helplessness
revolve around two things. One may feel helpless
to stop the harassment with individual
confrontation or the implementation of complaint
procedures. Someone who does not
want to quit his or her job may feel trapped.
Second, systematic harassment often results in
rewriting one's character or mischaracterizing
that person's competence, values, and personality.
This mischaracterization is often replete
with racial or ethnic stereotypes such as <i>laziness,
untrustworthy, sexually provocative,
sneaky, addicted, accent too heavy</i>, and
<i>unqualified</i>.


9. <i>Loss of Drive</i>. This cluster of symptoms
often emerges after prolonged harassment
and sometimes after one has left his or
her job. A formerly ambitious person does not
feel ambitious. Assumptions of how the world
works have been shattered. An extreme but
frequent manifestation of this cluster is the
desire to abandon one's career or change one's
line of work. Someone who has formerly initiated
projects may not do so for an extended
period of time. The loss of drive or ambition,
coupled with other symptom clusters such as
worthlessness, anxiety, and paranoia, makes
seeking work very difficult. During job interviews,
a person may have difficulty projecting
competence and desire for the job.


10. <i>False Positives</i>. The interpersonal experience
in the workplace may result in overgeneralizing
certain characteristics and associating
them with possible harm. In an effort to protect
oneself against further harm, one may
become suspicious or anxious of persons who
resemble the harasser. Thus, the client may
have become more suspicious of persons
racially or ethnically similar to the person who
has harmed him or her. This is more often the
case with persons who have not previously
experienced significant racism or discrimination
than those who have had significant racist
experiences over their lifetime.


Other typical symptoms include exacerbation
of physical symptoms, such as migraines,
acne, headaches, and skin conditions, or the
development of physical conditions that are
serious, such as high blood pressure, diabetes,
asthma, and autoimmune conditions. Other
physical responses may include hives, nausea,
sweating, and chest pains. Williams and colleagues
have documented the correlation of
stress, minority status, racism, and physical
health (e.g., Ren, Amick, &amp; Williams, 1999).
Fang and Myers (2001) and Mays et al. (1999)
have demonstrated a correlation between
physical response and symptomatology to the
stress of racism. Landrine and Klonoff (1996)
have studied the correlation of the increased
tendency toward smoking and increased psychiatric
symptomatology in African Americans
who score higher on an inventory measuring
exposure to racist events. Weiss et al. (1991-1992),
in a random survey conducted in 1989,
found that the perception of prejudice in different
environments, including the workplace,
resulted in both physical and psychological
symptoms.


One common psychological consequence of
chronic harassment in the workplace is the
desire to abandon this line of work as the type
of work and the conditions associated with it
become triggers for many symptoms associated
with the original harassment. Although it
is not in the purview of the evaluator to help
clients feel psychologically better after an evaluation,
it is important for the evaluator to
understand the feasibility of the client's changing
work, the source of this desire, and the
meaning of changing one's line of work.
Sometimes, a change of careers may further
exacerbate the trauma, with loss of income,
status, and a profound sense of grief.

<b>Diagnoses</b>


The most common diagnoses given following
the impact of racial, cultural, or ethnic origins
of harassment are acute stress disorder, post-traumatic
stress disorder, adjustment disorder
with depressed mood or with mixed anxiety
and depressed mood, major depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, and panic
disorder without agoraphobia, using the
fourth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (<i>DSM-IV</i>) as a
guide (American Psychiatric Association,
1994). Although the experience of chronic
racial or ethnic origins of harassment can be
traumatic, it can be difficult to meet Criterion
A1 of the diagnosis, which requires threat of
bodily harm or fear for one's life or physical
safety. In this case, PTSD is still a useful conceptualization,
but a diagnosis of adjustment
disorder, major depressive disorder, or one of
the anxiety disorder diagnoses may capture
most elements of the psychological distress.


Existing theories provide explanations for
the symptoms that emerge in the context of
chronic racial harassment. The social psychological
theories that are useful, offered by
Perloff (1983), Janoff-Bulman (1992), and
Lerner (1980), suggest that damage comes
from confusion when the person is confronted
with a world that does not operate according
to rules of justice or fairness. Although clients
will typically agree that this is not a fair world,
their psychological defenses, like those of most
persons, are constructed to believe and make
order out of how the world operates. When
this is profoundly challenged, they become
aware that they have less control over what
happens to them than they thought. Perloff
(1983) proposed a shift in vulnerability from
unique to universal that creates confusion and
disorientation in beliefs about causality. It is
common for people to resort to believing that
when bad things happen to a person, there is
usually a rational explanation. Some "unique"
characteristic of the person or his or her
behavior must serve as at least a partial explanation
of causing his or her vulnerability to
victimization. Thus, an individual may believe
that if a person does his or her job conscientiously
and with pride, is collegial to coworkers,
or goes the extra mile, bad things will not
happen to that person in the workplace. This
is belief in a "just world" (Lerner, 1980).
When bad things do happen to an individual
who holds this view, he or she does not have a
way of comprehending causality. This creates
anxiety. Quickly, this individual comes to
believe that what operates is "universal vulnerability,"
which stems from merely being
perceived as a member of a group that holds
lower status and about which other workers
attribute stereotypes. This essentially shatters
assumptions about how the world works and
causes significant disequilibrium (Janoff-Bulman,
1992) and a sense of helplessness.
Helplessness has been causally linked to
depression.


Behavioral conditioning theories also provide
useful ways of understanding how helplessness
develops and how environmental
stimuli acquire threat value. Repeated exposure
to harassment without effective intervention
or ability to stop it creates learned
helplessness. Out of self-preservation, certain
cues associated with events can acquire threatening
value; they become discriminative stimuli,
causing significant anxiety. These triggers
can result in false-positive responses to threat
as a way of minimizing harm. The individual
has to work very consciously to try to prevent
this type of conditioning from taking place.
Most individuals are not initially aware that
this conditioning has taken place.

<b>Summary</b>

When the workplace is the site of chronic discrimination,
it has psychological consequences
for most individuals. Although the Civil

This chapter provides a foundation for elements
of the evaluation process that can be
converted into elements of history taking for
therapy. These evaluations must necessarily
ask for details of the story and take a history
of experiences with racism. The psychological
consequences and the explanations for the
impact of symptomatology were offered.


In general, people are resilient. However,
the damage of repeated racism in the workPlace
ensues from a sense of threat to one's
means of a livelihood, sense of regard or value
in the workplace, and disbelief that overt racism
can exist on a repeated basis, even after brought
to the attention of superiors. When it occurs in
the workplace, one can be both trapped and
shocked. It profoundly challenges a person's
sense of causality in the world and his or her
sense of safety. These experiences almost
always move an individual from the prevailing
sense of invulnerability for self and unique vulnerability
for victims to a sense of universal vulnerability
from which she or he is not exempt
simply based on his or her minority status.
