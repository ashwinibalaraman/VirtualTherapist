BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: Well I had a really tough week. Really, really bad.
THERAPIST: Sorry to hear that.
CLIENT: That's okay. You can't—I think a lot of it is from this proofreading job. Just having a time pressure, having pressure being from doing something for somebody that I really like and having it be something that I'm supposed to be good at and not feeling like I'm doing a very good job. But I—yes, it's not exactly a free-fall but a very steep decline. It's like all of the things that I get anxious about have kind of come out in full force. And I kind of tried to keep completely updated on it but I can't really—I was getting, I don't know. Kind of I was getting worse upset and I just didn't want to be happy or it appears that when I get worse I don't want that to burn other people or what. So I would be like yes I had a pretty tough day today and I said that four days in a row. But I didn't quite realize that that added up to things are really, really bad until yesterday I called James and said okay what do I do with this situation and ended up being like no, James, things are really, really bad. He's said okay. [00:02:40]
THERAPIST: What was going on?
CLIENT: I'd come into campus with the intention of working. I needed to tell Principal Seth (ph) [inaudible at 00:03:02] term paper until next week but whatever. And I was coming to tell Principal Seth (ph) and was planning to work. I felt pretty good about working when I got up in the morning; by the time I got into campus after an hour on the train, I was anxious enough that I didn't feel like I was up to starting a new research project. I said well I'll just work on this other article that I'm working on for an hour and that will calm me down and I'll get to the next thing. And after an hour and a half of working on the bibliography I was just a complete wreck. I just couldn't—I was suicidal, it was just kind of falling apart. Okay, I need to stop working. I don't know what to do. I need to figure something out. [00:04:00]
My main reason that I came here today to talk about the last project that I did for him. And I haven't done any work since then for him. And what's more, the way that the employee system works is really stupid. They require that you turn in your hours for the week by Thursday afternoon, and instead of saying you just have a Thursday to Thursday week, as is sensible, they ask that you estimate your hours for the next three days. And so I had said I would work four hours and I hadn't done that. So I had four hours of work that I had gotten paid for but I haven't actually done yet. And so I expected him to tell me to do. Yes, but really what happened was that I called and I said can you help me solve this. This is the situation and he said I don't really know what you want, what do you think you should do. And I was like I'm calling you because I need you to tell me what to do, like it's so hard. Yes, and so what he said was sensible, was the only real problem here is that you're doing really badly. Everything else is not a big deal and is not really anything.
THERAPIST: So I think you were partly reacting to my being away.
CLIENT: It was part of it. It's one of those things where... [00:06:02]
THERAPIST: My hunch probably worse than what you would want to.
CLIENT: Oh, much worse than I would want to. Yes, I really wanted to be okay with that and I am sort of not. But it's not just that you were away, it's that everybody is away right now. Like [inaudible at 00:06:28] is out of town, well she's not out of town but she's on a working vacation.
THERAPIST: What's that?
CLIENT: I think she's hiding from work for two weeks while she works on a paper or project. And so she said I can see private practice clients if they need to, basically. She said I can fit you in if you need to see me, but—I'm sorry?
THERAPIST: Oh okay. I said it's [inaudible at 00:06:54].
CLIENT: And then Franco is out of town until mid-August. My dad just left for Asia.
THERAPIST: For how long?
CLIENT: A couple weeks. And it's hard to me to talk to people about that. And I feel like the worse I get the more I'm kind of frantic and not in control and but the things I need are so much less able to be—people just can't get them. There's so much more out of proportion that I can't, I don't even want to ask. So, yes. But, I think it was an unlucky weekend for you to be gone as much as anything else. I hope you had a good time. [00:08:33]
THERAPIST: Thank you. I suspect my being gone is more of a factor in that although maybe I'm wrong; hopefully [00:09:34].
CLIENT: So this idea or this thing that you brought up, my secret or whatever about that, I'm in part afraid that I will get better, that's really throwing me for a loop. Not because it's not true but because it is true and that makes me feel even more that all of this is my fault. I don't know. I am in some sense choosing to be in this situation and so... [00:10:35]
THERAPIST: Like you're more responsible than you have felt like.
CLIENT: And I don't always feel, it's always somewhere in my mind but it's been much more at the front. I'm having a really hard time. I mean I have been so scared that I was going to come back in here and say I had a really bad week while you were gone and you were going to be really disappointed in me. And that's something I formulate that thought in words and then the reasonable part of me says no, that's really not how therapy works.
THERAPIST: Take your time. [00:12:39]
CLIENT: And maybe that is [inaudible] insane, correct? I feel like people forget about me. If I don't call them and say that things still suck, I'm still here, I'm still having a hard time and I still need your help, then they think I must be doing better and they don't call me. I don't want to have to ask for help every single time, every single day, all the time. And then I don't blame people for forgetting either. It's just kind of how it works. That's just kind of how emotions work. You know, the worse it gets, up to a point and not beyond that point but up to a point, the more important it becomes to me not to break down in front of people. So... [00:15:40]
THERAPIST: Makes it more out of proportion. Your upset feels more unfair to somebody else you think?
CLIENT: Yes. More and more, as you said, the more we burn that it begins to take up too much of our filler space. Whether that's right, I feel like I had to [learn it] (ph). [inaudible at 00:16:11] a very kind of brittle chatty person, which I don't like, probably because it's very hard for me to listen to other people when I'm like that. [inaudible at 00:16:37], am I doing good? Yes, I'm having a rough time but, and then I change the subject. But I already said I'm having a hard time. I can't, I can't... [00:16:57]
THERAPIST: Really share that with them?
CLIENT: Yes, but I feel like that's on me.
THERAPIST: But you generally feel when it comes to it most that everything is on you.
CLIENT: Well, yes.
THERAPIST: Unfortunately.
CLIENT: That is true. James and I talked last night and it was rough. He's gradually developed this dynamic where I would be having a really hard time, really breaking down, always (ph) breaking down. I will talk to him about it, tell him what's going on with me and then there will be just silence, minutes on end of silence. And he's doing this because he's got his own conflicting and hard emotions that he's trying to keep under control so that he doesn't hurt me. He's trying not to say the wrong thing, and he's trying to listen to me, which I have asked him to do, but it really makes me feel like he's done (ph). [00:18:37]
And so last night I think I said when I'm like this—we had been having a conversation about psychology basically and I said well look this conversation's going to be too much for me. He said okay. But I cut it off in the middle and I tried to kind of go back and wind it down and he said no, just stop. Tanya, just stop it. Don't try to keep going. And I just broke down and cried and cried and cried. And silence. And so I said at this point in time when things are like this, it would be helpful to me if—for you to say nice things. Comfort me. Tell me that you love me and everything's going to be okay. Talk. And—more silence. And he said I do love you and this is what I'm trying to deal with. And I said I'm trying to tell you what I need but part of that is I need not to have to ask for it all the time. I need not to have to say say something to make me feel better. That's compressing about half an hour's worth of talking. [00:20:37]
THERAPIST: Well I imagine it's hard enough for you to be implicitly asking for something by being that upset when you're talking to him, and then to have to go another step of actually explicitly asking...
CLIENT: I mean I've been trying to say this for weeks. Anyway where I was going with this was that it's harder for me, I was thinking about it this morning, it's harder for me to have James feel like he's failed me than it is for him to actually fail me, or for me to deal with that. He really did fail me last night in some ways. He really—he should've been able to do things differently; he should've been able to take care of me better. But I can't stand him thinking that.
THERAPIST: That's a much worse thing for you, the thought of his feeling that way, than if only you were feeling that way [inaudible].
CLIENT: Yes, pretty much. [00:22:35].
THERAPIST: Yes, I noticed that my nose [inaudible]. I guess this also pertains to your worries about disappointing me by having had that need. And that though I am well aware that constantly you are, as the more reasonable part of you think about it differently, that you worry that I'm going to feel like I've failed if you have a hard week in addition to your feeling like you have?
CLIENT: Yes, in some ways. I just don't want it to be hard for you to take a vacation. That seems pretty ridiculous to me; I don't want that. [00:24:17]
THERAPIST: I see. That would make you feel terrible.
CLIENT: Yes. Yes, I don't want that for you and I really don't want to be the cause of that.
THERAPIST: And that's what most worries you about telling me how bad thing have been?
CLIENT: That and, I can't even think, I was getting better and now it feels like I'm not any more. We just talked about my being afraid to get better. We just talked about it.
THERAPIST: Yes, I was wondering how that fit in. Okay, so what you're saying is that you're worried this is a reaction to that?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: That you were feeling better and now you can't handle that and so you're getting way worse again?
CLIENT: Yes, and I don't know whether it's actually a reaction to that but because that's in my mind, I feel like my getting worse again is very much my responsibility and [my pain] (ph) is my fault and I worry that he will think that also. [00:26:46]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: I'm disappointed.
THERAPIST: Are you going to be thinking something along the lines of well it looked like Tanya was turning a corner there but I know some part of her is dead set against that.
CLIENT: Yes, or that I've decided not to turn the corner.
THERAPIST: And that that's her responsibility and that you may kind of have some say and decided not to get better. And that would make you the sort of person who wants to be upset, who wants to be affecting people because of that? Something like that? [00:28:15]
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Have you been [00:28:33] quite a bit?
CLIENT: Crying about you hasn't been high on my category, but it's on there.
THERAPIST: Yes, and it sounds like what has been high on the list is worrying that it's your fault.
CLIENT: Yes, and worrying about similar things about other people, everybody else, yes. But the things I need from other people are so out of proportion to what anybody can actually give me and that I'm choosing to be this kind of a burden. And so then people forget about me and don't help me because that's too hard.
THERAPIST: Because you're deciding to be so much trouble anyway?
CLIENT: You're being really [inaudible at 00:30:20], being really disappointed (ph) that people would quit asking. That's so fucking useless. I can't get two hours of work done a day without leaving. How am I going to live like this? As soon as I get excited about something I just run into a wall. I just can't do it. [00:32:38]
THERAPIST: You're referring to the new jobs?
CLIENT: Yes, yes.
THERAPIST: Also like therapy getting better?
CLIENT: I think that's more thinking about the job and not the—I feel like I'm getting better and so it's like okay I can take on this new job. I'm thinking that this is something that I love, this is something that I can get engaged with and I feel like I'm pretty good at it. Then it just sends me right back down into Hell and then I can't work. And I'm obsessing over mistakes that I made. [inaudible] It's like Tanya, you're a proofreader. The point of proofreading is that no one ever catches everything. That is—you've made your peace with that a long time ago. I just can't handle it. [00:34:41]
THERAPIST: Okay, so I mean it's sort of sounding like you've a bunch of things converging. You're getting jobs, you're feeling a little better, and then a bunch of people leaving or not—or stop or not asking how you were doing, which maybe all sort of contribute to the feeling that if you're a little better or things are going well or something then everybody's going to forget. [00:36:09]
CLIENT: Maybe, but I'm really okay with the people forgetting if I'm actually doing well. Really I am.
THERAPIST: I see, it's more when you're not. Then it's trouble.
CLIENT: And it's not that my doing a little better so far has been—I cry once a day, or once every two days. There are only a couple of hours a day in which I'm in utter despair. And I'll take that over where I am right now, but I don't want people to forget about me now. The work is really—I mean I haven't talked about it as much right now because I've had more time to kind of process it. And I found that dealing with it that I really was I think precipitating things. I'm just feeling like I'm never going to be able to do as well as I want to do it. Yes.
THERAPIST: So you mean the work that you're doing now is part of what precipitated how often you been feeling is not being able to do it as well and you never will? [00:38:27]
CLIENT: Yes, feeling like it's hopeless. Yes. And then thinking well if I'm feeling this bad, which is minor, how am I going to [really do] (ph) that job now? How do I do that? I don't even know what my life is going to look like in two months.
THERAPIST: My hunch is that that's much of a—I know it feels like a cause but I think it's more of an effect than a cause. The trouble with the work is that I just think it's more feeling emotionally such a wreck and feeling so sad, disappointed, scared. It's not that I'm saying work isn't important; I know work is terribly important. But if I'm—people say I'm trying to line the dominoes up in order—I think the word domino comes after the lack of emotions and relationships domino, although I think you tend to focus on the work domino and then what comes after it. It's not that I'm doubting your experience how awful it is for saying that these aren't real and crucial worries about what the fuck you're going to do if you can't work for more than two hours a day. Of course that is important, but I think you tend to look at that one and away from the sort of being a disappointment to you, disappointed by other people being apparently taking up emotional space and people feeling like a wreck and then not being able to work. [00:41:23]
CLIENT: Okay, yes. And it might just be that all of the other stuff [on the edge] (ph) for whatever reason wasn't—didn't feel as I was doing as good a job as I wanted to and then that makes everything else way, way worse. But it just blows everything up. It's awful in fact. That makes sense.
THERAPIST: [inaudible] but are there other things that you had in mind that you have been worried to let me know about?
CLIENT: No. I mean I let you know the things that I'm worried about, that occurs to me that I'm worried to let you know about.
THERAPIST: Why don't we stop for now and we'll talk some more tomorrow. [00:44:16]
