<font size="4"><b>Loneliness and Health</b></font>

Loneliness has been defined as the unpleasant
experience that occurs when a person's network of
social relationships is deficient in some important
way, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Loneliness
can be mild and fleeting but it can also be a persisting,
distressing experience. Robert Weiss has identified
two main types of loneliness: social loneliness stemming
from the absence of an adequate social network,
and emotional loneliness stemming from the absence
of emotional attachments provided by intimate relationships.
The proportion of people who acknowledge
loneliness varies as a function of various factors

Sociologists dating back to Durkheim have seen
social ties as the mortar of society, arguing that when
people feel alienated and lonely society is prone to
breaking down. Consistent with this view, among adolescents
loneliness has been associated with running
away from home and delinquent acts such as gambling,
theft, and vandalism. Similarly, sex offenders
have been found to be high in loneliness and a correlation
exists between suicidal ideation and loneliness.
Loneliness can be a costly, serious problem for individuals
and for society as a whole.


LONELINESS AND MENTAL HEALTH


Taking the American Psychiatric Association's
widely known <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders</i> (<i>DSM-IV</i>) as a standard for mapping
the terrain, there are numerous varieties of deficient
mental health. These have been grouped into
such categories of disorders as childhood, anxiety,
mood, personality, psychosis, eating, substance abuse,
and sleeping. A number of researchers have examined
loneliness as a correlate of mental health (for earlier
reviews, see Jones &amp; Carver, 1991, and Ernst &amp;
Cacioppo, 1999). They have generated a reasonablesized
body of work on anxiety, mood, and personality
but fewer investigations on other topics. In contrast to
the extensive evidence developmental psychologists
have gathered showing that children rejected by their
peers are vulnerable to loneliness, researchers have
done very few investigations on loneliness and childhood
<i>DSM-IV</i> disorders per se. Some researchers have
studied clinical populations, although undoubtedly a
majority have administered paper-and-pencil measures
to students or community residents. Thus, many
of their findings apply more to mental health tendencies
among members of the general public than to
individuals with clinically diagnosed psychopathologies.
In any case, numerous noteworthy correlations
have been found.


<b>Anxiety and Mood</b>


Several studies have shown that the more loneliness
people report, the more likely they are to report
anxiety. Complementing self-reports, trait lonely individuals
have high mean levels of cortisol, a physiological
indicator of anxiety. Loneliness has also been
implicated in various more specific forms of anxiety.
For instance, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann saw loneliness
as having much in common with panic states.
Empirical studies find loneliness coupled with social
anxiety in both children and adults. Not only has loneliness
been included as a facet of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), but also, among Israeli soldiers
exposed to the stress of the 1982 Lebanon war, loneliness
was an antecedent of combat-related psychopathology
2 years later.


During the 1970s, investigators observed a considerable
concordance between loneliness and depression,
so much so that they questioned if the two are
separate phenomena. The answer is yes in the sense
that statistical analyses have shown them to be distinguishable;
logical analysis indicates that depression
can result from any number of events whereas loneliness
is a response to interpersonal deficits, and their
correlates differ to some extent. More recent work
shows that a self-critical form of depression is more
closely associated with loneliness than a helpless,
dependent variety. Complementing their greater
depression, lonely individuals also report more negative
and fewer positive feelings in response to mood
scales. Lonely individuals are not a happy bunch.


<b>Personality</b>


In an early article published before World War II,
Gregory Zilboorg portrayed the personalities of lonely
individuals as manifesting narcissism, megalomania,
and hostility. Clinical writing and some statistical evidence
with clinical populations suggest that loneliness
is common among adults with so-called borderline
personalities. Such individuals have an unstable sense
of self and unstable interpersonal relationships, are
impulsive, have difficulty controlling their anger, and
engage in "acting out behaviors." Correlational
research shows loneliness is associated with several
other personality characteristics such as law self-esteem,
shyness, self-consciousness, neuroticism.
pessimism, specific forms of perfectionism, and insecure
attachment.

<b>Psychoses</b>


Loneliness is also a part of the experience of
schizophrenics. In one study, older adult patients
with residual-type schizophrenia mentioned that
they felt their loneliness had increased over the
course of their lives. In another study involving a
small number of schizophrenics and control participants,
schizophrenics were more lonely than controls.
Interestingly, and seemingly at odds with
discrepancy explanations of loneliness, the difference
between actual and ideal social support was the
same for both groups.


<b>Eating Disorders</b>


Loneliness appears to feed into eating disorders,
although it is probably associated with both over- and
undereating. Studies support the conclusion that obese
as well as underweight individuals are lonely. With
respect to loneliness, researchers have examined two
specific eating disorders, bulimia and restraint.
Bulimics are binge eaters who then purge themselves
of their food. Two forms of complementary evidence
show loneliness to be a characteristic of bulimics:
(a) Among a sample of college students those matching
the criteria for bulimia nervosa were higher in loneliness
relative to participants not suffering from
bulimia, and (b) older bulimics remember being
lonely in their childhoods. Restrained eaters are individuals
who think a great deal about food, have concern
over their weight, and tend to diet to control it.
Restrained eaters are lonely in their dispositions, yet
when they are put in a lonely mood, their food intake
is increased.


<b>Substance Abuse</b>


In half of the studies (<i>N</i> = 4) we could identify,
loneliness was a risk factor associated with drug
abuse. Apropos of alcohol abuse, a review of the relevant
literature concluded alcoholics feel more lonely
than most other groups. Loneliness is probably more
closely associated with drinking during times of
despair and unhappiness than social drinking. In
young adults, loneliness predicts problem drinking
(e.g., getting intoxicated). Those in treatment for alcoholism
also show greater loneliness and, among
advanced abusers, those high in loneliness show a
poorer prognosis.


<b>Sleep Disturbances</b>


Loneliness and sleep disturbances are commonly
mentioned features of bereavement. Do they also go
together at other times in life? Yes, according to John
Cacioppo and associates' recent research program in
which people's sleep was monitored both in a laboratory
and in their homes. Although lonely and non-lonely
people spent about the same amount of time in
bed, the lonely people slept a smaller proportion of that
time. They took longer to get to sleep and woke up
more often with the result being they were asleep less.
Lonely people also complained of more sleepiness
during the day. To the extent that sleep is a restorative
behavior promoting longevity, sleep disturbances may
be a pathway by which loneliness affects mortality
independent of health behaviors such as not smoking.


LONELINESS AND PHYSICAL HEALTH


Beginning with Berkman and Syme's (1979) classic
Alameda County Study, research has consistently indicated
that measures of social contact and number of
interpersonal relationships are related to physical
health. After controlling for other risk factors, Berkman
and Syme found that mortality rates among individuals
with the lowest level of social contact were 2 to 3 times
higher than among individuals with the highest level of
social contact over a 9-year period. Subsequent reviews
of research on the relationship between social relationships
and health indicated that higher levels of social
integration were consistently associated with reductions
in the mortality rate (see Seeman, 2000).


Given that loneliness reflects a lack of interpersonal
relationships or low levels of social contact,
these data suggest that loneliness should also be
related to measures of physical health. A number of
longitudinal studies have found that loneliness predicts
subsequent mortality. One recent study, for
example, indicated that reports of loneliness predicted
both 30-day and 5-year survival among heart bypass
patients. Related to this finding, two studies that
examined cause of death found loneliness to be associated
with higher rates of death due to heart disease.


Loneliness is also associated with a variety of measures
of physical health status. A number of studies
have found loneliness scores to be significantly correlated
with self-report ratings of health (e.g., how is
your health, how does your health compare to others)
with correlations ranging from -.18 to -.55. Loneliness

[p. <i>588</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284044-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One possible reason for this loneliness-health relationship
involves preventive health behaviors.
Loneliness has been found to be related to a variety of
health-related behaviors, such as exercise, nutrition,
relaxation, and substance use. Lonely individuals are
less likely to engage in preventive behaviors. For
instance, a study of older Canadian males and females
found that users of psychotropic drugs (e.g., antidepressants)
were more likely to be lonely (40%) than
non-drug users (16%). Loneliness has also been found
to predict health service use, with lonely individuals
reporting more doctor visits and more frequent visits
to the hospital emergency room.


The above suggests that there should be detectable
physiological effects of high levels of loneliness on
the body. Research by Jan Kiecolt-Glaser and Ron
Glaser at Ohio State University has documented one
such physiological effect of loneliness. They found
that loneliness predicted several indices of immunocompetence.
Studies they conducted using medical
students and psychiatric patients showed that loneliness
was related to immune system functioning of
participants (see Kennedy, Kiecolt-Glaser, &amp; Glaser,
1988). Supporting these results, a cross-sectional
study by other researchers found that loneliness was
related to lower numbers of CD4 cells in HIV-infected
men. However, a longitudinal study found that higher
levels of loneliness at baseline were associated with a
slower rate of decline in CD4 cells over a subsequent
3-year period in HIV-infected men.


<b>Causal Issues in Studying Loneliness and Health</b>


A critical question in examining correlational relationships
such as we have been reporting concerns the
causal mechanisms involved: Does poor health lead to
loneliness, or does loneliness produce poor health?
Could they mutually influence one another? Perhaps
there really is no direct causation, but rather one should
think of third variables producing these correlations or
mediating processes. For example, as discussed
above, studies have consistently found that loneliness
is related to depression, with correlations as high as
.50 to .60. Studies have also found that measures
of depression are related to subsequent mortality,
suggesting that the loneliness-mortality relationship
may be mediated by depression. Similarly, measures
of loneliness are typically found to be strongly negatively
related to measures of social support. Given that
social support has been found to predict mortality,
immune system functioning, cardiovascular disease,
and other indicators of psychophysiology, relationships
between loneliness and other measures of
physical health may reflect the influence of social
support on both loneliness and physical health.


To address these issues, Russell and his colleagues
examined the relationship between loneliness and mortality
while controlling for the influence of measures of
interpersonal relationships (including social support)
and depression among the elderly. A structural equation
modeling analysis was conducted examining the ability
of measures of social contact (i.e., social network size,
social support, club involvement, and church attendance),
loneliness, morale (i.e., depression, anxiety,
and life satisfaction), and physical health (i.e., functional
status, illnesses, doctor visits, and medications)
to predict subsequent 12-year mortality. Results indicated
that loneliness predicted subsequent mortality net
of measures of social support and depression, through
the mediating effects of physical health status.
Loneliness was found to mediate the effects of social
support on physical health and mortality, whereas the
measures of morale were unrelated to subsequent mortality.
These results therefore suggest that loneliness is
related to physical health and mortality net of the influence
of either depression or social support.


CONCLUSION


In sum, loneliness has been associated with a variety
of manifestations of poor mental and physical
health. Solitude may be a wellspring of creativity and
personal growth. Yet the experience of loneliness is a
gnawing, pathogenic discomfort.


Most lonely people would be happy to overcome
their loneliness. Using their own strategies and natural
processes of recovery, people by themselves often
overcome loneliness that is precipitated by such life
course events as going away to school or the death of
a partner. A variety of approaches have been offered
by professionals and even loneliness "businesses"
(e.g., cruise companies) for helping people alleviate
their loneliness. Professional strategies range from
community-based interventions, such as helping
