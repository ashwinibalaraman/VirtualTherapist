Dr. Schoen led me to his office. I sat down in the chair
as he directed, and lighted a cigarette nervously.


"How is it going?" He looked at me intently.


"I'm very tense. I hear that there are incurables on the
first floor. I am afraid that is where I should be."


"You told me when you came in here that your husband
is a wonderful person. Would you tell me whether he has
ever struck you?"


"Yes. He has."

"So, he did strike you upon occasion."


"Yes. One night he came home and slapped me. I don't
know why. He seemed angry because I had a friend across
the street of whom he did not approve."


"That must have hurt your feelings."


"Yes. It did."


"Do you love your husband now?"


"No," I screamed, "I hate him, I hate him, I hate him.
Why do you think I came to this hospital in the first place?
I wanted to get away from my husband and from my
neighbors."


"How are things going between you and the other
patients?"


"All right, but I don't think that I am going to make it
up here. The other patients are not as sick as I."


"Well," he said, "try to stay here one day more, and then
we shall see how you do."


"Thank you," I said.


As Dr. Schoen led me back to the ward, I noticed a disturbed
look on his face. I felt then that I was sicker than he
at first thought.
