The patients were allowed to make some noise in the
ward. However, the nurses seemed to sense when a powder
keg was about to blow, so to speak, in the guise of an unruly
patient. At the first sign of a disturbance the nurses would

These back rooms had bars at the windows, and the only
furnishing was a mattress on the floor. We had heard via
the grapevine that one of these rooms held a patient who
kept herself stripped of clothing most of the time. This must
have been the patient who screamed obscenities night and
day. Patients were usually taken to a back room only at
times of great stress.


As I was not taking shock or insulin treatments there
was a likelihood that at times I would have to be put in
the back room. Dr. Schoen wanted all the tensions and
pressures to come out naturally, and that is just what happened
during the following months.


I would suddenly become quite tense, then would come
the urge to scream and pace the floor. I would scream about
fires, doctors jumping out of windows, a curtain bursting
into flames, or about a woman leaning over me with a poker
and ready to strike.


When the urge came upon me I was whisked away to
the back room where I would scream and scream. At times I
would feel that I was something apart from myself, in acting,
that is; that I was only a spectator of my antics. The feeling
of acting without trying gave me an immense sense of
power. I would act in a manner alien to my natural self, and
in a sense, completely out of character.


One nurse told me that the doctors were quite pleased
that my emotions were breaking out, and that they wished
all the other patients could find the release that I was getting.


At other times I would be put either in a cold-sheet pack
or in a warm-water bath. The cold sheets were so helpful in
reducing tensions that after the third treatment I began to
ask for them.


This amazed Dr. Schoen, and he forbade further treatment
of this kind. Also, when he learned that the nightly
sedation kept me unnaturally elevated and woozy during
the next day, he eventually forbade that too.
