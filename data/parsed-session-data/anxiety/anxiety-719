BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I'm to instruct on Thursday, Fridays.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So maybe like Monday, Tuesday nights.
THERAPIST: I don't have any um; I'm just going to put this here.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I don't have anything right now at night.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: On Monday or Tuesday.
CLIENT: Okay. Because if not I can keep this if I'm going to be working as a lecturer. Then I can keep this because it will be after school.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So, I mean it's not a big rush.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But ...
THERAPIST: So you hope ...
CLIENT: I'm hoping to get a lecturer's position.
THERAPIST: Right. So then Thursday or Friday morning wouldn't work?
CLIENT: Wouldn't work unless it would before school and that wouldn't work.
THERAPIST: Would be early. Yeah. I also have a Monday morning time but it may not be appropriate. What is your Monday like?
CLIENT: Monday I do my internship. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
THERAPIST: What time do you have to be there?
CLIENT: I'm there at 7 a.m.
THERAPIST: Oh, it's early?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's not going to ... (chuckle) it's not going to work. That's why it all depends ... like this works for right now because then I can still get out of school and get out and over here in time.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: So ...
THERAPIST: Well let me know because I think ... well Thursday evening might be a possibility but you're looking for Monday or Tuesday.
CLIENT: Yeah Thursday evening could work too.
THERAPIST: Okay. If this works for you for now ...
CLIENT: Yeah this works for now and then ...
THERAPIST: Let's keep it. And if there's something that shifts let me know and I'll do my best to find time.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah that's not a problem.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because this time works good for right now.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because you know I'm already slotted in it we don't have move. So that works, thank you.
THERAPIST: Okay. Yeah.
CLIENT: Thank you. So everything's going okay. Just kind of feel ... like I kind of feel sad and you know just not depressed a little, but a little anxious because ... well my girlfriend ... one of her better friends just had a child. And then this summer we have three weddings. And I'm start to kind of feel the pressure a little bit again about she wants to get married. She wants to have a child and she wants to do all this stuff. And the more and more I think about it, the more and more I know that's what I want but I don't' want to jump into it like we did last time where I know I don't have a fulltime job yet. I know that money is going to be an issue and I'm trying not to let it be an issue. And the more and more that I just play it off, you know not do it, the more and more anxious I get about it because I'm kindly like in the same boat as her. I want it sooner rather than later but I also want to have an income coming in where I'm not going to be too far behind when I have a wedding to pay for, when I have a child to pay for, when I have a house to pay for, when I have all of this stuff just coming on top.
(00:03:03)
So with that being said I'm just kind of (pause) I mean I'm kind of running on the side of caution with her. I mean we do talk about, you know, I mean she's got a brand new niece. Her friend just had a baby and she's just seeing all of this. And I can kind of see where she's coming from where she's at that age where, you know all of her friends are almost just about married. All of her friends have children. And I kind of feel like, "Well what do I give?" Because I do want this. I do want to have a family with her. I do want to marry her. But I'm hesitant to jump right into it right there. And of course my parents are talking about they want a big wedding. My parents are talking about how they want grand children soon and they just keep throwing the money option at me. "Well don't worry about it, we'll take care of it." And it kind of again puts me in a tough situation like we talked about last week where me being able to provide for my family. Because, you know the clique and you know the old Middle Eastern world is, "You give your kids what you never got." But I pretty much got everything. And my thinking is now and I've talked about it with my girlfriend is, how am I going to be that person that takes away what never had taken away but was always given to me?
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:04:34)
CLIENT: Because I do not know how to be that person. I do not know how to that person where to set the boundaries where you can't have this. Because it was always given to me. Or they said I couldn't have it but then a couple, you know months would go by and then I'd have it. You know so I'm kind of up in the air again on this little scale where I'm up here, down here and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just like really confused of the situation about what's going on, like, (pause) just being involved in a relationship with house, kids, you know just everyday life just because I don't want to make the wrong decisions. (pause) but I want to make the right decisions that I feel are, you know not going to lead them the path that I was at. Where they feel like, "Okay, that was good for now, but if I stay on him, you know in a couple of weeks, couple of months I'm going to get it." Because that's kind of like what I did, in a way. And it's just ... it's frustrating to the fact where I just (pause) I think about the money issue all the time. And the money issue really, really concerns me. Even though I ... you know I'm hopefully going to graduate in May and you know I'm going to start looking for, you know an employment positions. But I have to ... I have to wait and I'm the type of person who I can't wait because again this is the control factor was I can't control my future right now.
(00:06:22)
I can't predict where I'm going to be in six months. I can't predict if I'm going to have a job in six months and I guess that control aspect kind of brings out the anxiety in me again where I do have a lot of control issues. I do have a lot of issues where if I'm not in charge, if I'm not the one who's making the decisions, if I'm not the one who's you know coming up and planning on what's going on I just ... it's hard for me to take a backseat. It's hard for me to just sit there and let it go. I will say that I am getting better at digesting information as opposed to just reacting to information. But in a way the same information that I'm now digesting it kind of eats at me a little bit more. Because now I'm thinking about it more. I'm thinking more rationally. I'm thinking about all different angles as to opposed to just the reactionary one and then fixing it. And to be honest with you that is a little bit more overwhelming to me a little bit. Because I just feel like that's more stress that's adding into my life. That's more aspects that you know before I didn't want to think about them and I was avoiding. But now I'm letting them in and I'm actually trying to deal with them. And (pause) it keeps on building and building and building and it's getting very (pause) stressful. And it's frustrating. It's frustrating in a way where like, you know I don't what to do.
(00:08:13)
I don't know what to say. I don't ... you know she tells me all this and like I say I tell her I want to but how much of it is getting through to her and how much of it is, "Okay, is he going down this road again?" And that's the doubts and the confusion and the stuff that I have in my head to the point where I just (pause) I don't know what I did mentally to damage her. I mean I don't know what kind of damage that I have put on our relationship. Granted our relationship I feel has been the strongest it's been in years. Where we're actually communicating more. We're actually talking more about you know situations. Talking more about us. Talking more about a future. But again I'm also when we have these discussions I don't say as much as I used to say. I don't just tell her what she wants to hear. I tell her now truthfully how I'm feeling. I tell her how nervous I do get about it. I tell her how, you know I understand she keeps telling me it's not a financial thing, it's not a financial thing, but it is.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:09:33)
CLIENT: Because just being around and just talking to people ... when they say, you know you got to learn to live on someone's salary, just like one person that frightens me because I don't if ... you know, I don't know how to do that. You know I've lived on one person's salary but now I have to live on one salary with a wife, with maybe a child, with you know a house mortgage and all that stuff and all that stuff bothers me.
(00:10:09)
THERAPIST: But a lot of people need two incomes.
CLIENT: Excuse me?
THERAPIST: I said a lot of people ... are you talking about like supporting a family on your own?
CLIENT: I'm talking about ... yes.
THERAPIST: I guess I was just commenting that you know some people need both incomes. That's pretty common.
CLIENT: No I would agree with that.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: But it ... you know with that she mentions the fact that she would ultimately like to be a stay home mother.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: Which I have no problem doing. But that means I have to, you know work more. Find a way to make as much income as possible. Find a way to; you know assume whatever the family needs. But then again I also am thinking right now where I (inaudible00:10:55) that's extra income. You know I do work at the restaurant, that's extra income. But on the other hand she gets upset because I am doing all this other stuff. (pause) I am you know taking other time and she feels I don't have anytime for her. And I guess I'm confused at the point. It's just like, "Well what do you want from me?" I'm confused that, "Okay. Well you know that you know you make twice as much as I make and you sit there." I go but me I'm already you know twenty thousand dollars behind your base salary. And in my mind I'm like, "Okay well I gotta makeup just twenty thousand dollars a year just to make what she's making on base. As opposed to her making you know her bonus, her commission, all that stuff. Because in the roles that I've had I've never gotten bonuses, I've never gotten a commission, I've never gotten any of that stuff.
(00:11:54)
THERAPIST: Does she make good money?
CLIENT: Oh yeah. She makes real good money. And she keeps telling me she never has money. And I don't understand that when she's very conservative with her money. She doesn't spend a lot of it. She doesn't ... you know she's not extravagant. She's the type of person who again is like me who worries about money that's she's never going to have enough. When she has a substantial amount saved already. She's got a substantial amount invested already. And when she tells me that she doesn't have enough money that just kind of digs at my hide a little bit more to make me realize (pause) well she's making this kind of money and I know that she's making money and I'm looking at it going, "Jesus how the hell am I supposed to do this?"
(00:12:42)
If she's stressing out about making this much money and worried about money? In my head I start panicking even more. To the point where I'm just like, "Aw Jesus. What am I going to do?"
THERAPIST: Does she know you feel that way?
CLIENT: She does now. She does since we've started meeting and communicating more. She does know how I feel. She does know ... we had a conversation about our conversation when you know I told her about her job and how it's still affects me. I don't know if I mentioned that last week. But I told her how; you know I felt betrayed by her. And I don't know if that was the right thing to say to her at the time but I just felt now that we were opening up more and we were communicating more that I did need to tell her how I felt.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:13:33)
CLIENT: I did need to tell her, you know that I still, you know have a lot of anger towards her company. I still have this anger you know and part of the anger is she's the type of person that's making all this money, you know? And she's not ... you know she told me the other day that she got credit for making money when she didn't do anything. And then it started spreading back ... flashbacks of me doing all this work for other people and other people making all this money on my back. And then ... I mean the rage didn't come in but the anger started (inaudible00:14:09) a little bit more. The anger to the fact that you know how could people just do this? Take this money when they don't deserve it. How could a company pay someone who had nothing to do with, you know? And I look at myself and I'm like, "What am I doing wrong where I can't just fall into money like that?" Where I can't just do nothing and the next thing you know, "Oh here's a present for you." and nobody says anything. To me that's very frustrating. You know it's very frustrating to the point where, you know what she could make in commissions or a bonus is more than what I make in a years salary.
(00:14:50)
And it's frustrating to me. How you know how that happens. And it makes me wonder like, "What am I going to do? How am I going to be able to make this and support, you know who I need to support." (pause) It's very ... it's frustrating and I know, you know the field that I'm going into is ... its going to have good opportunities for me. I mean I'm going to be able to make some decent money. But I'm not going to be able to make a lot of money, you know? And right now my major concern is being comfortable. I want to be able from every paycheck to be able to save this much amount. To be able to put, you know a separate amount away and to still have some extra spending money after bills are paid. For me that's the living comfortable. I don't want to get a check one week and have that whole check be gone and then get a check another week and you know three quarters of that is gone and I only get to put a little bit of that away. And so I'm not spending any money. That is my biggest fear in the world. It's just not being able to pay for stuff. And not getting myself into debt.
(00:16:07)
THERAPIST: Well it does seem like you ... I don't know if it's quite putting the cart before the horse. But like you know you think about, "Okay, how am I going to be the only bread winner with kids and a wife like verses like, well what about you know moving in with your girlfriend and seeing how the two of you ... you know but you're trying to. You're going so many steps ahead.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Rather than you taking one step at a time.
CLIENT: And I guess that's my problem though is because I do look ahead. I do kind of jump the gun a little bit. Because I do feel ... and I don't if it's just me or if it's us, you know from everybody I talk to because I get it, you know my parents, I get it from her, I get it from her mother. You know I kind of feel like I'm getting a lot pressure on me to be engaged, to start a family, to get married and to do all this stuff. Even my great aunts and uncles are the same way. They're like, "Well we need to do something. Like what are you waiting for?"
(00:17:12)
THERAPIST: So it seems like it's less coming from inside you and more coming from outside?
CLIENT: It's coming from outside and it's like a lot of peer pressure. And it's to the point, well like every holiday comes or goes and I get the same question over and over. And I'm starting ... the rage is starting to buildup like, "Leave me alone. I'll do it when I'm ready." You know, I know what my plan is but I just don't know when I'm going to execute it. Because right now I'm at a stand still because I feel like, you know on financial mountain I'm still at the base. You know I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a ring and then you know be in debt with that. I don't want to do that (pause) because I keep hearing too you can't get it less than this, you can get her a ring that cost this much. You can't do this you can't do that. And to me that bothers me because they don't know what I'm doing. They don't know what I want to do. I know what I want to do.
(00:18:16)
THERAPIST: So in that sense maybe it's hard even in this particular way to be independent. Like rather than resist ... because resisting implies that there's something to resist.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: Verses just you having your own thoughts.
CLIENT: I am. And (pause) it's new to me too because, you know I kind of ... this is what I'm control of, this is what I can control and I feel I have no control over it. And that's what you know it irritates me. You know if frustrates me into the saying, "This is the one thing I thought I had a full grasp on." And now I completely feel like my hands have slipped and I'm holding on by like two fingers. Because everybody else is putting in, everybody else is throwing their two cents in. Everybody else is, you know, "Well this is what you need to do. This is what you need to do." My parents are giving me a timeline. They're like, "Are you going to have a grandkid before I'm seventy?" That's in five years. I don't know. You know and it's just ... I feel like you know my life is controlled by other people. Where they just want to lead me into this direction. You know when really I just want to go in my direction. And it is frustrating because I just ... I don't know what to do.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And I don't ... you know the more and more ... and this is the part that you know coming to these sessions has helped me on is now I'm thinking more rationally. But the more I look back on it the rational thinking is more complicated than the reactionary thinking.
(00:20:00)
THERAPIST: How do you mean?
CLIENT: Because reactionary I just do something to put people in their place and then worry about it. Now I'm just taking in all this information and thinking about every aspect of it and when I think about every aspect well then my big decision-making comes in again and I can't take it. (pause) Because I don't want to ask for people's opinion because people are still giving their opinions. You know what I mean? It's weird when before I make a decision I need like three or four, five different opinions and then I'd make a decision on what my parents thought. Now I'm getting all these opinions when I never asked for them. Putting them all together and I need to make a decision and I'm having doubts about what decision to make.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm. I mean lots of people give opinions. The problem is that you care.
CLIENT: I do care.
THERAPIST: Like, you know no one knows your financial situation exactly. So who are they to say you should buy a ring? But you care. It's almost like it's hard for you to kind of brush it, they can want whatever they want. It's not really relevant to me. It feels deeply relevant to you.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
(00:21:17)
(pause)
CLIENT: Well (pause) see because I don't really know because my whole life was based on what everybody thought. Where I did a lot of my decision making based on the reaction I'd get from people. You know, how people thought of me? How they reacted when they see the things that I did and what I ... you know what I was doing. And now I guess I'm scared of their reactions. I'm scared of what they're going to think of me because I want to do the right thing. I want to do it my way.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: But there's that fear of me, you know stepping out on the ledge without anyone holding my hand or crossing the street without anyone holding my hand. And am I going to be able to really do it, you know? Because part of me has the leash on me. Part of me has, you know the ropes saying, "Hey don't forget about us over here." You know and that's the trouble I have because I was so dependent on my parents. I was so dependent on their opinions on what they, you know they thought was good for me and I'm slowly ... not as fast as I'd like too but I'm progressively you know cutting the string, cutting the cord, cutting the rope to the point where I don't want, you know, I don't need their opinions. I don't need their decision-making. You know it's extremely difficult because after so many years of just repetition, you know doing this. Why are you doing this? Why can't you do this? Do it this way not that way. It's slowly you know ... it's hard to break away. Because it's what I'm used to. It's what I'm comfortable with.
(00:23:20)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And that's the hardest part is getting out of my comfort zone.
THERAPIST: Well you talked about how you're not comfortable with it. So what part of it are you comfortable with?
CLIENT: I'm comfortable with the fact that I'm going to have to make this big decision to break away from them sometime.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I told myself that I am, you know someday my parent's aren't going to be here and I'm going to have to move on. I know that part. I know that for a fact. But part of me also is comfortable in the fact well I have them here. They're still in good health. They're still, you know up and moving around. Why are you giving up that opinion? Why are you giving up that life? So I'm kind of you know torn again between where I'm comfortable in the fact that you know someday they're not going to be here. But also I'm not comfortable in the fact where, you know even though they're around and they can do it, to just you know move on. And the hardest part is moving on while they're still around.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I think it probably would be easier to move around because I wouldn't have that safety to go back too. But now I think the safety of it is preventing me from just doing what I want to do.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: Excuse me. And that's the hardest part that I have right now and it's still ... it's a constant struggle. I mean I see the same thing with my brothers. I mean my sister, you know she's ... I'll give it to her, she's the independent one in the family. She said she was moving out, she moved out when she was 20-year-old, hasn't been back since. You know I only moved out to go to college and then I moved in with my girlfriend. I was back in you know, a few months.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:25:10)
CLIENT: So I don't know what it is about my brothers and me, you know we can't let go of our parents. We can't move on from them. And to me it's its frustrating. Because I do want ... you know I ... again I see my parents I do want you know a home. I do want a family. I do want all this stuff. But again I keep telling myself how am I going to get it staying at home? How am I going to get it living the life that I'm living? But then again I'm not totally unhappy living the life that I'm living.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And it's ... I guess it's a balance thing that I'm slowly working on. I'm slowly trying to move on and to be independent and to do the things that I want to do. Just because I don't know why. I guess I've never, you know had that sense of freedom of being able to go wherever. But in a way I did. Where my parents ... even when I was in high school I never had curfews. You know I never had, you know I was never disciplined for any of this stuff. You know my parents just kind of let me ... gave me some freedom to live my life. To come and go as I pleased and I did. And I think that was where the problem was because I thought I needed a little bit more structure because you know if I had a curfew in high school of you know say midnight or eleven o'clock then you know maybe I would have felt intimidated or scared by you know breaking these rules. But I never, I never had it. I was always given freedom, you know I mean I parents always used to give me money before I'd go out in high school. "You need money?" And they'd give me like thirty or forty bucks. And I'd be like, "Okay." You know, and that's how my life was. I always had it handed to me. I never ... I mean my girlfriend tells me this, she had purchase her first car from her parents. They showed her some responsibility with money and how to take care of it and pay for other stuff. When I was given a car my first car. I didn't have to pay for the gas. I didn't have to pay for the insurance. I didn't have to pay for the maintenance on it. She had to pay for the gas. She had to pay for the insurance. She had to pay for the maintenance. You know all this stuff, I look back on and I'm just like, well why didn't they, you know set a better structure for me? Why didn't they, you know have guidelines that I needed? You know and me again being a control person I'm jumping a hundred steps forward thinking how am I going to have these guidelines with my children?
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:28:18)
CLIENT: How am I going to say no to them when I was never said no too?
THERAPIST: Well maybe before your children if you do that yourself. Like how do you say no to yourself? How do you, you know, this is handed to me but no I want to do something on my own.
CLIENT: Well that is tough because I ... I mean my parents still you know, "How are doing for money? You need some?" And sometimes I do take it because I do ... I do get nervous that I'm going to need it.
THERAPIST: That's interesting. You know what came to my mind was drugs. Like, "You want a little coke? Just take a little coke." Like this is sort of like a ... you know it's not good for you but you really want it. It has that quality to it the way you're describing it.
CLIENT: You know it does and I kind of feel like I'm an addict for my parents.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: You know? And I do have an addictive personality. I'm not going to lie. Because getting back to the drugs. Like I started with marijuana or started with alcohol. Then I went to marijuana and then I went to prescription pills, you know then it went to harder drugs. Then I went to cocaine and then it just you know kind of spiraled. Like I just tried on new things. But that addiction of my parents is always been there. Where you know even when I needed it and I never stole from my parents. I never stole from any of my family members but you know I felt bad in college when I'd blow through all my money. You know I'd work and it would be gone. And then my parents would be, "Do you need some money?" And I'd take it and I'd use it on drugs. And to me that's you know (pause) it's to point where I knew if needed ... if I wanted the drug so bad I knew where I could get the finances for it. And for my parents to not ask where it was going, how I was going through hundreds of dollars so fast (pause) not questioning anything really kind of ... you know it ... thinking back on it I kind of am upset because I mean I wasn't going to tell them that I was doing drugs. But I feel bad in the sense that I lied to them and they were feeding my addiction.
(pause)
(00:30:44)
CLIENT: They were feeding my addiction for the drugs. They were feeding you know my addiction to drink, to do all the stuff, to go out. And it's kind of like the freedom that I had you know in high school where they didn't ask questions. They just gave.
THERAPIST: Well maybe in a sense part of the reason it's hard to you know move out of the house and move on is because you're still waiting to be taken care of. Because what you're describing is in a sense them not taking care of you. You know your girlfriends parents saying to her, you know for you to buy the car is a way of really going out of their way to teach her about responsibility, really taking care of her.
CLIENT: Mm-hm.
THERAPIST: Not just being like, "Oh do whatever you want."
CLIENT: I guess that's right. Because I mean I was never taught any of this stuff. And then I'd slowly get you know falling into the fire and I'd get frustrated because I didn't know anything. And I'd get you know and that's when I'd get like angry and upset because I didn't know anything. And that is you know an alarming factor to me is why am I staying there? What am I waiting for them to take care of me for? I'm an adult. Why am I still doing the things that I did before but I'm not do it. What I'm doing now is just totally different. I'm trying to move on and I can't.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: You know most people talk you know, "I can't wait to get our of my house. I can't wait to do this." And me I'm just like why would I leave? I have everything I want, why would I leave? And that's the mentality that I'm slowly trying to push away, to cut the cord with, is the why would I leave mentality. (pause) I mean I just ... I don't know how ... I don't know what to do. I mean I'm so, so wrapped up in it that it feels like every layer that I peel off, the layers below it are even thicker. And just trying to cut the surface and break the surface. It's harder. It's harder because in a way I don't want to ... and I know I gotta you know get over this but (pause) I felt guilty that I left them the way I did before. I felt guilty that they needed me. That they did you know depend on me a lot. And now that I've moved back there I found out that they don't need me. That they didn't need me as much as I thought they did and it's harder for me now to accept that. (pause) Because that was kind of the whole reasoning that I didn't move back. Was because you know my brothers ... I really didn't have any you know confidence in them to help out or do anything just because they never had.
(00:33:56)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: They were like me they did their own thing. But I was the one who always hung back, took care of my parents first then did my own thing. So now it's to the point where, "Okay well I'm back." I know they can survive. I know they'll be okay, you know? What do I need to do to move forward? To just move on. And that's what I'm slowly telling myself and discussing through my head is they will be okay. They will be able to survive. You know they don't need you anymore. Where I used to depend on them so much they don't depend on me as much because they can do their own thing. They can you know survive; they have my brothers. You know they don't need ... they don't need me. And in reality is I don't want to believe that. I want to believe that they need me.
THERAPIST: What does it mean for them to need you?
(00:35:01)
(pause)
CLIENT: To just be like supportive. Like if they need something done they can ask me and I'll do it. If you know ... to depend on me to be there. It's kind of like we talked about you know last week is how I feel indebted to them. I feel like I can't do enough for them to payoff my debt. I can't get over the fact where you know they're my parents, they're supposed to do that. You know it's like I talked about where you know I do things for weak people just because I want to feel like how I feel towards my parents. Is where people will feel that way towards me. But when it's me who's that person who's indebted (pause) I don't know how to say, "Okay my debts been paid."
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I don't know how to say it's okay you can move on.
THERAPIST: What are you indebted to them for?
(pause)
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. That's what I can't answer. (pause) I mean I'm indebted for all the things that did. Well to start I mean I want to say that indebted for the things that they gave me. They helped you know my dad put four children through college. My dad gave us cars, he helped buy us cars. You know everything I needed he was there to give. But I guess in reality for the (pause) I mean the more and more I think about it the more and more like the gifts and the stuff that I got, you know maybe it was just a cop-out for you know him not being around when we were younger as much as we had liked. Maybe it was you know him calling to his mother's house all the time and not coming home until like an hour or so before we were ready to go to bed. Maybe it was you know how when I was little he you know he'd come to all my hockey games but like when I was on travel baseball you know I always had to get a ride. And my dad would come and I would look in stands waiting for him and he wouldn't come until like almost the end of the game because he was working. I don't know. (pause) You know maybe it's just because I am upset at the fact that I didn't get to spend as much quality time with my dad as I wanted to.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
(00:37:48)
CLIENT: Look at all these other kids who's like dads coached their team. Whose dads got involved in stuff. I think maybe that's why I got involved in coaching because I didn't want to miss any of this stuff. You know from the time when I had a child. Maybe it's you know I don't want to be that you know father who drops his kid off and you know, "Call me when it's over." I don't want to miss that. I want to be there. I want to be a part of that. To me that's ... I think that's what hurts the most is I wanted that support system when I was playing and when I was doing stuff and I never got it. (pause) I never got it and I guess that's why I you know I coached my little brother. I got into coaching. Because why the reason I started coaching was because my little brother's team needed a coach. When I went and did all the stuff and got licensed in three months to coach his team. And I never missed his practice. I never missed his games.
THERAPIST: You gave to him what you wished you got from your dad.
(00:38:59)
CLIENT: I think I did. I really do. Because my dad would come to all the games but he wouldn't go to the practices. You know ... well he would come to the practices and stuff but it was only for hockey. You know even for baseball like my dad would never ... he'd never come to baseball practice. Which is fine. Baseball practice I didn't need you but he very rarely came from beginning to end for all my baseball games. Even soccer he very rarely came to all my you know beginning to end soccer games. He'd always come you know half way through or miss it. It's just like ... and to me like I don't know looking back on it I'd get upset because I was you know ... he paid for all these camps for me to go to to get better. And I was one of the top athletes from them and usually if you're one of them usually your parents want to be a part of that. My mother absolutely had no support with them. All she did was drop us off. She never came and watched any games. She never came ... I mean she was good. She used to get you know used to get ... thinking back on it she used to get frustrated because we'd have practice and she'd have you know two kids that weren't doing sports because of work and she'd have to go across town and then back across town and do all of this stuff and drive us around and my dad wasn't there. So I guess my mother, I saw her negative energy towards it and I guess it kind of made me feel bad when I just didn't want to do it anymore.
(00:40:35)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: But they knew that I loved being involved so much that it ... you know they didn't have the heart to take it away from me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I mean I would have devastated if they took away baseball and hockey from me. But if they could not meet the required ... the commitment to have me to practice and to games all the time, would I have understood it back then? No. Now, yes. If they told me no I couldn't do it I wouldn't be able to forgive them for that. But I think the most hurtful thing is to you know not have that support that I was looking for. You know then I see my little brother where you know I did take on that support role. I was there. I was his coach but I was there. I was at every game. I was at every practice. I didn't miss much. I didn't want to miss it. And right now it's to the point where as I'm getting older I'm coaching all these teams and I'm just like, "Well you know this is what I want to do. This is what you know I want to be a part of this." But as I get older the more and more I'm thinking about you know family and stuff is if I'm coaching this new team, you know am I going to have time to go to my kid's game? I mean I look back at the guy I coach with who's you know one of my best friends whose older, who's a police officer. Where he coached, you know we coached one team and his son was on the other team. And the only game that he got to watch of his sons was when they played us.
(pause)
(00:42:24)
CLIENT: And that like that bothered me a little bit. I'm like why are you even coaching? Go watch your kid play.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: You know? I get frustrated to the point where you know people miss their children's stuff. I get frustrated at the point where people you know just drop their kids off and then come and pick them up. That irritates me. Especially games where it's just like, "Well I mean you couldn't stay. You were too busy you couldn't stay and watch your kid play for an hour? Two hours?" Like that really bugs me.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: You know and I guess that's probably because of the anger that's been built up because I never had it. (pause) I used to I mean my dad used to criticize me for not playing. Because he'd get there and be like, "Well you're not playing." "I did. But you weren't there. Like I started." You know like (pause) ... it's frustrating.
THERAPIST: It sounds like in the one hand it's hard for you to leave because you feel like your were given too much in the one hand. In the other hand it feels like it's hard for you to leave because you feel like you weren't given enough.
CLIENT: Yeah. Well I was given too much of one thing and then not enough of the other. And that's where my scale is ... it's off balance. You know I feel like I was given more than I was ... you know the other way. And it's frustrating. It's frustrating because in essence I wanted less of this one and more of this one. But I ended up getting this one to counterbalance this one going down.
(00:44:01)
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And it (pause) it is frustrating because people do say like ... and I don't want to say that ... I didn't have a bad childhood. But in a way I did. (pause) Because I mean I got everything I wanted. I did everything I wanted to do but I still like (inaudible00:44:25). I don't feel like I had the support. I don't feel that I have the structure to say, "No you can't do that. Yes that's fine you can do that. No you can't do that." And I guess that's what I'm lacking is even now is I can't say no to myself. Because if I want something I'll just go do it (pause) and if I you know if I know I'm not supposed to do something, I'll do it. You know when ... you know ... I don't really know the meaning of the word 'no'.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: I don't really know, "No you can't do that." I don't know because to me no means, "Okay wait a couple of weeks or whatever." And it will mean yes.
THERAPIST: Try it then.
CLIENT: You know that's (pause) that's what I was you know growing up with. That's what I know. That's you know what I'm comfortable with.
THERAPIST: Mm-hm.
CLIENT: And breaking away from that is (pause) not comforting.
THERAPIST: And "C" we're going to need to stop for today.
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: All righty. Thank you, Dr. Feldman.
THERAPIST: My pleasure. Thank you so much. I'll see you next week.
CLIENT: All righty. Thanks.
THERAPIST: Okay. Bye, bye.
