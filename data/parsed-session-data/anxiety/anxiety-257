<font size="4"><b>10: Grandparenting and Extended Support Networks</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


Grandparenting is an important part of the life-cycle. Grandparent-grandchild contacts
are often quite frequent and usually satisfying. Proximity is an important variable,
although becoming less so now, with technological advances such as email. This contact
allows grandparents to influence their grandchildren in many ways, directly and
indirectly. There are distinctive roles in grandparenting, which vary between individuals,
historical periods, and cultures. An important element of this is often acting as surrogate
parents. Parental separation or divorce can greatly affect grandparents and their
relations with grandchildren. This chapter sets out the major issues in this area.


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


Grandparents and grandchildren have been described
as being a 'vital connection' (Kornhaber
and Woodward, 1981). Grandparenting is certainly
an important part of the life-cycle; about
three-quarters of adults will become grandparents.
In the developed countries, the average
age of becoming a grandparent is around 50 years
for women and 52 years for men. With high death
rates not coming in until the late 70s (mostly
men) and 80s (especially women), this means that
many will remain grandparents for some 25 years
or about a third of their lifespan, and children will
often grow up with both sets of grandparents. The
three-generation family is now the most common
modal. It can be considered normative today for
children up to early adulthood to have grandparents,
and for people in their late 50s onwards
to have grandchildren (Rossi and Rossi, 1990).


This is a dramatic change from a century ago. It
has been shown in the US context that of those
born at the beginning of the 20th century, only
about one-fifth had <i>any</i> grandparent still living by
age 30. For those born now, almost four-fifths will
still have at least one grandparent alive by the same
age. This change is part of a larger demographic
shift from a 'pyramidal' age structure of the population,
to a 'beanpole' structure. The pyramidal
structure, typical through human history, has a predominantly
young society and large families with
limited intergenerational presence. The beanpole
structure is the opposite, with smaller families and
extended kin groups but greater intergenerational
length, including grandparents, and extending to
great-grandparents (Bengtson, 2001).


<b>MAJOR CONCEPTUAL ISSUES</b>


Development takes place in an historical
context. Bengtson's approach illustrates this. He
distinguishes <i>period</i> effects (historical period),
<i>cohort</i> effects (when you were born while living
in an historical period), and <i>lineage</i> effects (different
generations within a family structure).
Historical and cohort effects are important in

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

An emphasis on <i>lineage</i> rather than <i>age</i> is
appropriate for this topic, where we are primarily
looking at the generational relationship of grandparenthood.
Terms such as 'grandparent', 'parent',
'child', and 'grandchild' are relative; someone
may be both a parent and a child, for example.
Many researchers use generational labels such as
G1, G2, G3 to avoid this ambiguity. However,
this device has its own difficulties, as if G1 refers
to a grandparental generation, then there is no
appropriate label for any great-grandparents. In
this chapter, we take grandchildren as the reference
point, and refer to their parents, grandparents,
and great-grandparents.


Grandparents can of course vary in age a great
deal, whereas lineage remains constant. Age of
grandparent can be considered as one factor
(among many others) affecting grandparental
relations. Another factor to be considered is
culture. Most of our evidence on grandparent-hood
comes from modern urban, industrial societies,
particularly the USA and to a lesser extent
Western Europe. Generational relations would
have been (and still are) very different in agrarian
societies, being embedded in a system with
strong kinship ties and strong expectations of
reciprocity; parents tended to have many
children, mortality was relatively high, and
parents expected children to support them in old
age. The urban-industrial revolution reduced the
importance of kinship and parentage; and the
concept of child-rearing changed from one of
lifelong reciprocity to one of launching children
into an autonomous maturity in which their
future relationship with parents was optional
(Caspi and Elder, 1988).


<b>IMPORTANCE IN
RESEARCH, COMMENTARY,
POLICY AND PRACTICE</b>


Falling fertility and increasing longevity have led
to the demographic ageing of Western industrialized
societies. Population ageing is shared by all
these nations, but they differ in degree and speed
of the process. In the last few decades, there has
been an increase in divorce rates and in numbers
of reconstituted families and step-kin; greater
health and financial security in older generations;
and with this some greater ambiguity in the role
of grandparental lineage.


These demographic changes may even have
influenced the extent to which grandparenting has
been an object of social scientific and psychological
research in the last 20-30 years, in
addition to demographic changes. Three other
reasons for the greater focus on grandparenting
research have been suggested (Tinsley and
Parke, 1984):
<table>

<p>
• the broader perspective of developmental and
family psychologists beyond the parental
dyad and 'nuclear family' to wider social
networks."

and processes of intergenerational influence;
and
</p>
</td></tr>

</table>
Theoretical and statistical models need to be
complex to cope with the three-way or multiple
relations and patterns of direct and indirect
influence entailed in analysing grandparent-grandchild
influence and interaction.

family psychologists beyond the parental
dyad and 'nuclear family' to wider social
networks."


• greater consideration of a lifespan framework
and processes of intergenerational influence;
and


• overcoming some methodological difficulties
associated with working with grandparents.


Besides an increase in research on grandparenting,
there are now a number of websites
for grandparents (such as http.//www.grand-parenting.
org/kornhaber.htm), and popular books
on the topic. There are important policy issues
regarding grandparents helping parents of young
children getting into the workforce (by providing
surrogate care for young children); and for rights
of access to grandchildren when parents divorce.
Courses in grandparenting may also be important
in helping maximize the potential of this role in
society (Werner, 1991).


<b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</b>


Some early articles about grandparents appeared in
the 1930s and 1940s, influenced by the psychoanalytical
perspective that was powerful at the
time. These articles were usually written by
psychiatrists or other clinicians, and gave a rather
negative view of grandparental influence. For
example, an early article by a medical practitioner
criticized the 'malignant influence of grandmothers'
who interfered with the mother's childrearing
in old-fashioned and didactic ways
(Vollmer, 1937). The conclusion was that grandparents
were not suitable as 'custodians' of the care
and rearing of their grandchildren. They were seen
as disturbing factors against which parents should
protect the child to the best of their ability.


A more balanced view started to emerge in the
1950s. It was acknowledged that there were

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From the 1960s, grandparents started to be
presented much more favourably in publications
on the topic. This may reflect some actual
changes in grandparental attitudes and behaviours.
Although the early studies are probably
unrepresentative in terms of sampling, it does
seem that earlier in the century more grandparents
were co-resident, and had a more authoritative
attitude to their families. By the 1960s,
however, many grandparents accepted a 'formal'
or 'fun-seeking' role, clearly demarcating grandparental
and parental roles. In an early study,
only a very small proportion of grandparents saw
themselves as 'reservoirs of family wisdom'.
This decrease in formality and authority probably
allowed more indulgent and warm relationships
between grandparents and other family
members (Neugarten and Weinstein, 1964).


From the 1970s, writings on grandparenthood
continued this more positive picture. Grandparenthood
was investigated (primarily in North
America) for the importance of grandparents as
support and socialization agents and as valued
intergenerational family members (Tinsley and
Parke, 1984). In the early 1990s, Smith edited a
selection of studies of grandparenthood from different
industrialized countries, helping to balance
the great bulk of research from the USA (Smith,
1991). Over the last two decades, there has been
a considerable increase in research on grand-parenting.
These generally have a more positive
view of the role than was given in the earlier
studies, while recognizing that difficulties can
occur, as in any relationships.


<b>CORE ISSUES</b>


<b><i>The Nature of Contacts between
Grandparents and Grandchildren</i></b>


Grandparents play an important and supportive
role in the lives of grandchildren, and
grandparent-grandchild contacts can be mutually
rewarding. The consensus of a considerable
number of studies on contemporary grandparents
and grandchildren is that they see each other
moderately frequently, and the relationship is
usually (though not invariably) quite close and
satisfying, rather than involving conflict.


How close grandparents and grandchildren
live - their physical proximity - has been found
to be the most important factor in frequency of
contact and level of emotional closeness between
grandparents and grandchildren. In many countries
(such as the US, UK and Poland), the majority
of grandparents have been found to live fairly
close to their grandchildren (an average distance
of 30 miles/50 km is typical) and they see their
grandchildren weekly or at least monthly. In
Finland, the vast majority of grandparents, even
when quite elderly, see their grandchildren at
least once a week; and most see the relationship
in positive terms (Hurme, 1988). In Germany,
grandparents typically see grandchildren weekly,
or more often for preschool grandchildren
(Sticker, 1991).


Generally, grandchildren ranging in age from
young children to adulthood feel a strong emotional
bond with their grandparents, and this is
reciprocated. Over four-fifths of US grandfathers
said they felt very close to the grandchild with
whom they had most contact, and ranked grandfatherhood
as the third most important role in
their life, after being a spouse or parent (Kivett,
1985). Similarly in the UK, most grandparents
state that their relationship with their grandchild
was closer than any or most relationships they
have had (Drew, 2000). The predominant tendency
is for grandparents to see grandchildren
often enough to share a quite close and satisfying
relationship. However, there is variation in contact
and satisfaction in grandparent-grandchild
relationships: as in any other forms of human
relationship. Some grandchildren may not like
their grandparents; one Polish student reported,
'I don't like my grandmother; she's sloppy and
disagreeable... I don't like visiting her'; and
another, 'she's always running about, grumbling,
nagging and shouting' (Tyszkowa, 1991). The
relationship of the grandparent has usually been
generalized to all of their grandchildren; but different
grandchildren will have different needs
and personalities. Grandparents, not surprisingly,
spend more time with those grandchildren they
regard as 'special' than those they describe as
'irritating'.


Grandparents engage in a wide range of activities
with grandchildren, such as giving treats,
providing a 'sense of family', imparting family
history, taking part in family events, playing
games, going on trips, baby-sitting, 'making you
feel good', giving emergency help, giving personal
advice, being 'someone to talk to', joining
in religious activity, and giving advice on school.
Intimate conversations have been reported in a

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In summary, most grandparents see many
grandchildren at least once a month, sometimes
much more often, and generally the relationship
is seen as positive, emotionally rewarding, and
important, by both generations.


<b><i>Is Proximity Important?</i></b>


An important factor in the frequency of contact
and level of emotional closeness between grandparents
and grandchildren is their proximity. At
least, this was found to be the case in research
through the 1980s and early 1990s. While many
grandparents and grandchildren live within 30
miles (50 km) of each other, in the US a quarter
live more than 500 miles (800 km) away, and
this greater distance is the strongest factor in predicting
(lower) frequency of contact. In almost
all cases, the grandchild with whom a grandfather
had the most contact with was also the
closest geographically (Kivett, 1985; Hodgson,
1992). In Finland, a sharp decline in frequency of
contact with 12-year-old grandchildren was
found when grandparents lived more than 20 km
away, although there was little change in the
perceived importance of the relationship, up to
60 km (Hurme, 1988).


Changes in transportation and communication
provide other avenues to maintain contact, so
these patterns may be changing in contemporary
times. For decades, the telephone has been available,
although expensive for frequent long-distance
use. Telephone contact plays an
important role in sustaining the relationship
between adolescent grandchildren and paternal
grandparents, and the frequency of telephone
calls is a more effective predictor of grandparent-grandchild
closeness than letters. In a US
national study, about two-thirds of grandparents
communicated with their grandchildren weekly
or more via the telephone. However, contact was
more likely to be initiated by grandmothers,
younger grandparents, and those with younger
grandchildren (Silverstein and Marenco, 2001).


Although little research evidence is available,
it is clear that many grandparents now use email
and text messages to maintain contact with
grandchildren. In a UK study, it has been found
that grandparents who lived a long way away
from their school-age grandchildren, and saw
them yearly, felt as emotionally close to them as
to their grandchildren who lived closer and
whom they saw weekly. All the grandparents
who were separated geographically (ranging
from 70 to 450 miles or 110-725 km) from their
grandchildren had some form of indirect contact
with their grandchildren: about half spoke on the
phone weekly, almost as many spoke on the
phone twice weekly or wrote letters once a
month, and about one in ten emailed twice
weekly (Drew, 2000). In the UK, recent data
show that the vast majority of grandparents and
grandchildren kept in regular telephone contact
and some via email. It is a common experience
that distances seem to shrink when daily email
contact across countries and continents can be
maintained (Age Concern, 1998).


<b><i>Characteristics of Grandparents
and Grandchildren</i></b>


Factors specific to the grandparent and grandchild
that might impact the grandparent-grandchild
relationship are gender, lineage (paternal or
maternal), age and health of the grandparents,
and age and gender of the grandchildren.


Age of grandparent can be an important consideration,
just as age of the grandchild can. In a
US national study, younger grandparents tended
to live closer and have greater contact, while
older grandparents provided more financial
assistance (Silverstein and Marenco, 2001).
College-aged grandchildren identified reasons for
closeness with younger and older grandparents:
for younger grandparents (aged 50-60), reasons
were more to do with love and appreciation, intimacy,
and shared activities, while older grandparents,
especially those over 75, received more
reasons to do with affection and other positive
sentiments for the grandparent.


No special connection between age of grandparent
and satisfaction with the role of grandparent
or in the amount of help given to grandchildren
has been found. However, younger grandparents
(ranging in age from 45 to 69) express greater
responsibility for grandchildren's discipline and
for giving child-rearing advice than older grandparents.
This may be due to the age of the grandchild.
In an Italian study, grandchildren aged
8-9, 12-13 and 16-17 years were questioned.
The youngest group more often described playing
with grandparents, especially maternal grandparents,
while older grandchildren saw their
grandparents as somewhat less important, but

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Effects of age of grandparent are often confounded
with grandparent health. Older grandparents
are less likely to be in good health, and
this can affect the relationship. Mild health problems
may not decrease the satisfaction with a
relationship, but more serious illnesses such as
Alzheimer's disease, not surprisingly, may
decrease levels of intimacy and affection,
although not nurturance for the grandparent
(Creasey et al., 1989).


Just as mothers are more often the closer
parent to children, many studies find that grandmothers
are more involved with grandchildren
than grandfathers, and grandchildren feel closer
to grandmothers at all ages. Similarly, the usual
finding is that maternal grandparents are more
involved than paternal grandparents. 'Sex role'
beliefs may influence grandchildren in identifying
the grandmother as having a greater influence
on their values, and feeling closer to them.
However, traditionally closer mother-daughter
relationships may be influential in grandchildren
of all ages having closer relationships with
maternal than paternal grandparents (Smith and
Drew, 2002).


Compared to grandfathers, grandmothers tend
to anticipate and become involved in the nurturing
role sooner and have greater satisfaction with their
current and expected grandparenting role. Gender
roles place importance on emotional interactions
for grandmothers and granddaughters, while
grandfathers and grandsons focus on doing things
together, and instrumental and practical support,
such as financial or career advice. However, when
involved, the evidence is that grandfathers are able
to nurture and respond to children's needs as
effectively as grandmothers. Some grandfathers
are more nurturing than they were as fathers. The
differences may lie in personal perception of
the role and variations of human interactions, or in
the diverse cultural norms of relations between
genders in different societies (Rossi and Rossi,
1990; Kornhaber, 1996).


<b><i>Direct and Indirect Influences of
Grandparents on Grandchildren</i></b>


What influence do grandparents have on the
development of grandchildren? These are generally
distinguished as <i>direct influences</i>, resulting
from contact and face-to-face interaction, and
<i>indirect influences</i>, mediated by other means
such as parental behaviour (Tinsley and Parke,
1984).


<b>INDIRECT INFLUENCES</b>


One source of indirect influence of grandparents
is via financial support. Grandparents can often
help grandchildren by assisting the middle generation
(parents) financially, for example, in buying
a home, or a better home than could otherwise be
afforded. In a US national sample, about one-third
of grandparents gave gifts or money to their
grandchildren (Silverstein and Marenco, 2001).
These grandparents were more likely to be older.
Grandparents may also give emotional support,
for example when parents experience family
stress, separation or divorce, as seen later. This
can help the grandchildren, quite aside from any
direct contact that may take place.


More subtly but just as powerfully, grandparents,
by acting as parents themselves, will
have influenced the way in which their children
act as parents to the children. To some extent,
parents take their own parents as models of the
parenting process. Some studies have looked at
transmission of general parenting qualities such
as warmth, autonomy, depression and aggression.
In a Finnish sample there were significant
correlations between grandparental and parental
child-rearing attitudes and practices (Ruoppila,
1991). In the US, the quality of the grandparents'
marriage was found to be repeated in the marital
happiness of their adult children and the transfer
of skills through the generations, from grandparent
to parent to grandchild (Rossi and Rossi,
1990). A modest relationship through the generations
(grandmother to adult daughter to granddaughter)
has been found for 'autonomy' and
'warmth'. In a sample of Dutch grandmother-mother
pairs, there were strong grandmother-mother
links for educational level, affection and
conformity; and also from grandmother affection
to mother's psychological well-being (Vermulst
et al., 1991).


Intergenerational influences have also been
found for antisocial behaviour, drug abuse and
psychopathology. The use of physically aggressive
and punitive techniques in the grandparent-parent
generation predicts similar behaviour in
the parent-grandchild generation and antisocial
behaviour in the grandchildren. In the Berkeley
Guidance Study in the US, links were found
between problem behaviour and unstable ties in
the family across four generations of women
(Caspi and Elder, 1988). Relations between
grandparent and maternal drug abuse and behavioural
/developmental problems in grandchildren
aged 2 to 8 years have been found, especially for

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some generational transmission may be
through modelling of 'parenting behaviours',
while some of it may be genetic. Another sort of
explanation has been put forward by attachment
theory. In infancy, attachment type is assessed by
the 'Strange Situation' (SS), yielding classifications
of <i>'secure', 'avoidant', 'ambivalent''</i> and
'<i>disorganized</i>' attachment with the mother or
care-giver. Attachment theory argues that these
behavioural patterns acquired in infancy and
childhood become internalized representations,
reflecting trust or ambivalence learnt in primary
relationships. They become 'internal working
models of relationships'. In adult life these are
assessed by the 'Adult Attachment Interview'
(AAI), which yields four categories (Van
Ijzendoorn, 1995):
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 'autonomous' - recalling earlier attachment-related
experiences objectively and openly,
even if these were not favourable;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 'dismissive' - earlier attachment-related
experiences seen as of little concern, value or
influence;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 'preoccupied' - still dependent on parents
and actively struggling to please them; and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 'unresolved' - a trauma involving, or early
death of, an attachment figure, which has not
been worked through.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
There is a moderate predictive link between the
child's SS category with (usually) its mother and
the mother's AAI classification reflecting her
model of the relationship with her own parents
(her child's grandparents). Studies in this area are
fraught with methodological and other complications,
which make interpretation difficult. From
the small number of studies available, however, it
appears that there is a strong carry-over of attachment
style from childhood to adulthood.


• 'autonomous' - recalling earlier attachment-related
experiences objectively and openly,
even if these were not favourable;


• 'dismissive' - earlier attachment-related
experiences seen as of little concern, value or
influence;


• 'preoccupied' - still dependent on parents
and actively struggling to please them; and


• 'unresolved' - a trauma involving, or early
death of, an attachment figure, which has not
been worked through.


Part of this intergenerational transmission
appears to be due to maternal sensitivity to infant
signals. Available evidence shows these links
across three generations - grandmother-mother-infant
triads - show similar attachment styles
(Benoit and Parker, 1994).


Attachment theory emphasizes consistency over
generations, but it also predicts that adults can
work through or resolve unsatisfactory relations
with their parents and modify their 'internal working
models' or the way they perceive and respond
to key relationships through self-reflection, with
the aid of therapy or counselling. A current
and continuing study of survivors of the
Holocaust in World War II finds that, although
many survivors (now grandparents) score 'unresolved'
on the AAI, due to the traumatic way in
which they lost their parents at an early age, few
of their children score unresolved. Their grandchildren
appear to be indistinguishable from the
remaining population in terms of attachment
characteristics (Bar-On et al., 1998).


<b>DIRECT INFLUENCES</b>


Examples of the direct influence of grandparents
on grandchildren are giving gifts, being a companion
and confidant, acting as an emotional
support or 'buffer' at times of family stress, passing
on family history or national traditions, and
acting as a role model for ageing. The most direct
form of grandparent-grandchild influence is
through acting as a surrogate parent. There are
three levels at which this can happen:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• temporary childcare or daycare when the
grandchild goes to the grandparent's house;
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• co-resident grandparenting, where grandparents
live in a three-generation household
with the grandchild; and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• the grandparent-maintained household or
'skipped generation' family, in which
the grandchild is cared for directly by the
grandparent(s).
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
We review these three areas below.


• temporary childcare or daycare when the
grandchild goes to the grandparent's house;


• co-resident grandparenting, where grandparents
live in a three-generation household
with the grandchild; and


• the grandparent-maintained household or
'skipped generation' family, in which
the grandchild is cared for directly by the
grandparent(s).


<b>PRACTICE OF GRANDPARENTING</b>


<b><i>Childcare</i></b>


Grandparents are often relied on to provide babysitting
or regular childcare to help parents, who
may be working full-time, while the children are
young. The majority of grandparents in the US
seem to provide childcare or baby-sitting for
their younger grandchildren. Those grandparents
who live either with or near their grandchildren
and those with a college education appear more
likely to offer this service to parents. The decision
to care may be initiated by the grandparent.
Many grandparents are not paid for the childcare
provided, and the most frequent pattern is maternal
grandparents who care for their daughter's
children.


There are advantages for all three generations
when the grandparent provides childcare. Parents
are confident that their children are in a loving
safe environment, they have reduced expenses,
and are able to be better employees, through
timekeeping and reduced preoccupation with

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Grandparents who Parent
Their Grandchildren</i></b>


The most intensive form of childcare occurs in
grandparent-maintained households - grandparents
who parent their grandchildren. The 1997
US Census Bureau indicated that 1.3 million
grandparents were rearing grandchildren between
1980 and 1992, an increase on previous figures.
The reasons for the adoption of this role change
range from parental incapacity due to drug use,
teenage pregnancy (of their daughter), divorce,
mental and physical illness AIDS, and child
abuse to parental incarceration and no doubt
others. Grandparent-headed households appear
to be more common in African-American and
then Latino or Hispanic than European-American
families. No similar information is available for
other multi-ethnic countries.


Grandchildren reared in grandparent-headed
households are reported to have poorer academic
performance than similar children in parent-headed
households. This may be because these
families are often poor, with less adequate health
care. Many grandparents who are raising their
grandchildren are in good health and work outside
the home. African-American grandparents
appeared more satisfied with this role, while
more European-American grandmothers report
feeling trapped in their role - not having enough
time for themselves, lacking privacy, and having
to tolerate unwanted change in their home environment.
However, both African-American and
European-American grandmothers have high
levels of satisfaction with themselves as a function
of their grandparent role. African-American
grandmothers are more likely to have friends or
other family members rearing grandchildren and
feel less tired or isolated. But for some, there
is a price to pay. Some grandparents who look
after their grandchildren have a higher incidence
of depression, anxiety and risk for physical and
emotional health problems (Kennedy and
Keeney, 1988).


<b><i>Grandparenting Role and
Psychological Well-being</i></b>


The grandparenting role is largely a matter of
individual adaptation and may not be equally significant
to all grandparents. Nevertheless, a
substantial majority of grandparents in a US
national study reported that the grandparent
role was extremely important to their sense of
self (Silverstein and Marenco, 2001). Although
the grandparental role is developed through the
process of interaction with grandchildren, the
'meaning' of grandparenthood also emerges in
part from past relationships with one's own
grandparents and observations of one's own
parents as grandparents. The individual meaning
of the grandparent role is certainly a major factor
in the importance placed on the grandchild relationship
and how it is enacted. There is no way of
predicting it until it happens.


Researchers have identified typologies or different
styles of grandparenting. In brief, grandparenthood
holds significant positive meaning
for most grandparents in multiple and often overlapping
ways. These include fulfilling an emotional
need; a sense of biological renewal in the
continuation of family characteristics; being a
teacher or resource person; and seeing the grandchild
as an extension of themselves. A few
grandparents, however, feel remote from the
relationship. The meaning of the grandparenting
role is very specific to the individual and has
been found to vary between gender and lineage
(Neugarten and Weinstein, 1964).


<b><i>Changes in Roles with Time and Culture</i></b>


In the Pacific Rim countries of China, Japan and
Korea, family ties including grandparental bonds
tend to be especially close, and many grandparents
still live in three-generation households.
In a study of elderly people in the Philippines,
Taiwan and Thailand, almost half lived with
young grandchildren (Hermalin et al., 1998). The
majority of older parents in Beijing, China, live
with an adult child, usually with a grandchild
present. Preschool care by grandparents in China
has been associated with rather better school performance
than parental care (Falbo, 1991). There
are possible complications in this finding (such
as socio-economic status), but frequency of
grandparental contact, plus grandparents' educational
attainment, predict better language and
mathematics scores in first- and fifth-grade
children. Korean grandmothers have been credited
with increasing their grandchildren's
resiliency by providing sources of attachment,

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the USA, several studies have documented
the particular importance of grandparents, especially
the maternal grandmother, in African-American
households. Currently about half of
African-American children live in single-parent
female-headed households, about three times the
figure for European-American families. Also, the
generation gap tends to be shorter. There is thus
more opportunity in African-American families
for younger grandparents to be involved with and
support their grandchildren (Burton and Dilworth-Anderson,
1991).


Expectations and practice of grandparental
roles and behaviour, in Western societies,
changed over the 20th century. Western grandparents
have, by and large, settled into a 'supportive'
role in which they are available to help
parents, but do not interfere with parental decisions.
A US study found that grandmothers could
give a list of rules that they used to regulate their
behaviour with their grandchildren (Johnson,
1983). These rules suggested they should be an
advocate, mediator, support, and source of enjoyment;
they should not be too intrusive, overprotective,
parental or too old-fashioned. Most
contemporary UK grandparents seem able to find
a balance in their role of supporting the family
through emotional and practical help, but of non-interference
in the parenting style of their adult
child and son/daughter-in-law.


Changes in grandparental role can lead to
intergenerational difficulties and disagreements.
This can happen through historical time, but also
through processes of 'acculturation', changes in
the cultural behaviour and thinking of an individual
or group through contact with another
culture. Children of immigrant parents and
grandparents more rapidly adopt the language,
styles and customs of a new, larger culture they
are in, than the older generations, leading to
changes in perceptions of the parent or grandparent
role. In a study of Muslim mothers who lived
in extended families in Britain, acculturation was
found to contribute to disagreements in childrearing
practices with grandmothers, often
resulting in the mothers having unusually high
levels of depression and anxiety (Sonuga-Barke
et al., 1998). The more closely adapted the inter-generational
family, the greater amount of discrepancy
found in child-rearing practices, with
grandmothers being more 'authority orientated'
and mothers more child-centred.


In the USA, the extent of absorption in the
new culture of adult Mexican-American grandchildren
has been found to affect the amount of
contact they reported with their grandparents.
However, grandparents did not feel a sense of
loss of closeness. In a comparison of Mexican-American
and Euro-American adult grandchild
and grandparents, similar high scores of affection
were found for both ethnic groups (Giarrusso
et al., 2001). However, the new culture did not
appear to have affected Mexican-American
grandsons family orientation since they indicated
greater affection for their grandfathers than
grandfathers reported for grandsons, in keeping
with Mexican cultural values. Indo-American
grandparents appear more accepting of their
grandchildren moving away from the culture,
than they are of their adult children (Pettys and
Balgopal, 1998). They believed it was necessary
for their grandchildren to change in order to get
ahead in the American culture that they perceived
as positive, whereas they expected their
adult children to stay close to their ethnic origins.
In Greece, a study of families with a Greek father
and a British mother identified differing views
of grandparents and parents from two distinct
cultural backgrounds (Anderson, 1999). These
differences made the grandparents difficult for
grandchildren to accommodate when they were
developing their own cultural identity.


<b><i>Grandparents, Grandchildren
and Parental Divorce</i></b>


Separation and divorce have become more
common events over the last few decades in
many countries, including the US and the UK
(Rodgers and Pryor, 1998). When parents separate
and divorce, this can have a tremendous
impact on grandparent-parent-grandchild relationships.
The relationship of grandparents to
parents, particularly to a custodial parent (or one
who has care and control of the grandchildren),
becomes a crucial factor in their relationships
with the grandchildren. If the grandparent-parent
relationships are harmonious, this opens opportunities
for a supportive role: grandparents can
provide stability, support and nurturance to the
grandchild(ren) and family, often also providing
financial assistance or childcare. Grandparents
can negotiate relationship difficulties between
the parent and grandchild and be a 'stress buffer'
and source of emotional stability during times of
family distress, which can benefit grandchildren
even when their relationship with the grandparent
is not intense (Smith and Drew, 2002).


After parental divorce a significant increase in
contact occurs for some grandparent-grandchild
pairs, notably for those maternal grandparents
who can respond flexibly to their daughter and

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The consequences of unwanted loss of contact
with grandchildren can be devastating for grandparents.
Researchers have studied reactions of
grandparents to the family rupture. They find
that after loss of contact with their grandchildren
due to parental divorce, grandparents report
symptoms of bereavement and damage to their
physical and emotional health. Some join support
groups, where these are accessible.
Following loss of contact with a grandchild due
to divorce and also to family feud, there are for
many a range of negative consequences, including
intense chronic grief, symptoms of post-traumatic
stress, both preoccupation with and
tendency to avoid thinking about their grandchildren,
mental health problems, and lowered
life satisfaction, with some being clinically
depressed (Drew and Smith, 2002). One grandparent
stated, five years after loss of contact
with their granddaughters, 'My life ended when
I lost my granddaughters ... I hurt the same
depth of hurt day after day. I still see my
psychologist every week'. Another grandparent
reported 'a feeling of sadness that my son is
being deprived of his daughter's "baby years"
and that my granddaughter is being deprived of
her Daddy's company and influence' (Drew,
2000).


Many grandparents continued to 'hope' for a
reunion with their grandchildren. While this may
not be totally unrealistic, it may make it difficult
to work through the grief process. As one grandparent
stated, 'I miss her [granddaughter] so
much, my family will never be complete until
she returns to us. I know she is out there somewhere
and I shall see her again one day. I'll never
give up hope till my dying days. I have eight
grandchildren and one lost, but one day there will
be nine.'


Grandparents can sometimes negotiate a better
relationship with the custodial parent, in order to
have contact with their grandchild. The personality,
resources and coping strategies of grandparents
can be important in this. Grandparents
who have a greater sense of positiveness and
competence in the grandparenting role find ways
to be involved in their grandchild's life, even
when obstacles stand in the way. As another
option, grandparents may consider mediation or
gaining legal support for contact with their
grandchildren, as discussed below. With time,
also, grandchildren become more independent.
Young adult granddaughters who had a close
intimate relationship with their grandmother
have been shown to bypass the parent generation
and maintain contact after parental divorce.


<b><i>Step-grandparenthood</i></b>


After divorce, remarriage can produce complicated
three-generation family relationships. A grandchild
could have three types of step-grandparent,
resulting from a <i>parent</i> remarrying (the most
usual), a <i>grandparent</i> remarrying, or from the
<i>parent of a step-parent</i> remarrying. One study
obtained the views of mothers on grandparent relations
with grandchildren and step-grandchildren
(Henry et al., 1992). The relationships were perceived
as 'different', with more step-relationships
described as 'remote'. A comparison of US
grandchildren's perceptions of grandparents and
step-grandparents by their college-aged grandchildren
found that grandparent-grandchild
relationships were closer, with more frequent
contact, greater emotional involvement, and role
expectations, than step-grandparent-grandchild
relationships (Sanders and Trygstad, 1989). All
the same, about half their grandchild sample saw
the step-grandparent relationship as important.
The differences appeared to be partly, but not
completely, a product of the length of time for
which they had known the (step-)grandparent.


<b><i>Death of a Grandchild</i></b>


The probability of a child under the age of 15
dying has decreased from 62 per cent in 1900 to
4 per cent in 1976 (Uhlenberg, 1980). This probably
explains why only seven studies to date
have investigated how the death of a grandchild
affects grandparents, and on their role within the
family following bereavement. In all these studies,
despite the varying ages of the grandchildren,
family characteristics, or causes of the
death (such as accident, or sudden infant death
syndrome), grandparents reported great anguish,
grief, sadness, and emotional and physical pain
as they suffered a threefold grief - for their
grandchild, their adult child, and themselves
(White, 1999). Grandparents can provide a great
source of emotional and practical support to the

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Grandparents and Lesbian Mothers</i></b>


Little is known about the grandparent role in
lesbian families. One study looked at lesbian-mother
families with children aged 4-9 years,
who lived with either their biological or adopted
lesbian mother (Patterson et al., 1998). The
majority of grandchildren were in monthly contact
with their grandparents. They had more frequent
contact with biological grandparents and
had fewer behaviour problems than those with
less frequent contact. Another study of lesbian
mothers with children aged 5 years who had
been conceived through donor insemination
found that the arrival of children led to
improved relationships with (grand)parents in
most of the cases and increased contact for over
half (Gartrell et al., 1999). There do not appear
to be any grandparenting studies of the apparently
rare cases where the child stays with a gay
father and his partner. Because of the rarity of
the cases, no generalizations can be made. The
welfare of the child, which includes contact
with grandparents, has to be individually evaluated.
On the face of it, there are no reasons why
considerations regarding lesbian mothers
should not equally apply to gay fathers, in
relation to their children and contact with
grandparents.


<b><i>Grandparents of Grandchildren with Disabilities</i></b>


Grandparents can be vital sources of emotional
and practical support when a grandchild has a
disability. None the less, sometimes the grandparent's
immediate inability to accept a grandchild's
disability can be a source of added stress
to the family system. The birth of a grandchild
with a disability evokes emotions that are different
from those experienced when the grandchild
is healthy. The grandparents often experience
anxieties for their newborn grandchild's health,
their adult child's ability to cope, and their role
as a grandparent (Myer and Vadasy, 1986).


In these circumstances, grandparents may frequently
be trapped in disappointment and grieve
for their grandchild as well as their adult child.
Grandparents who attend support or educational
groups related to their grandchild's disability
may have more positive feelings. Grandparent
education about their grandchild's disability is
associated with greater acceptance and more
involvement with their grandchild. Educational
workshops for grandparents about their grandchild's
deafness, for example, have been shown to be
helpful not only in educating the grandparent but
in assisting them to let go of their denial about
their grandchild's disability (Schilmoeller and
Baranowski, 1999).


As with grandchildren generally, it is maternal
grandparents who typically provide most emotional
support to families with disabled grandchildren.
One study found maternal grandparents
to be more likely to learn sign language to
communicate with their deaf grandchild than
paternal grandparents (Nybo et al., 1998).
Maternal grandmothers are apparently also able
more accurately to assess the development of
their grandchild with autism than the paternal
grandmother (Glasberg and Harris, 1997).


<b><i>Great-grandparents</i></b>


The parental role is well established with rules,
rewards and sanctions; the grandparent role is
more variable. The more extended intergenerational
roles, such as great-grandparenthood, are
still more ambiguously defined. 'Role salience'
or relevance has been found to decrease consistently
with each generation, from parent to grandparent
to great-grandparent. Three particular roles
have been identified for the great-grandparent:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• personal and family renewal,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• 'diversion' in their lives, and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• a mark of their longevity.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Psychological well-being has been found to
be associated with investment in the great-grandparenting
role through the parent and
grandparent role.


• personal and family renewal,


• 'diversion' in their lives, and


• a mark of their longevity.


One study of great-grandmothers aged 75 to
89 years showed, for example, that they saw
their role as intrinsic to the family system - they
initiated family gatherings or were the cause of
them. Great-grandparents took gift-sending to
their great-grandchildren seriously, and this
allowed them to stay visible in their great-grandchild's
lives. Many provided childcare.
There was sometimes competition with grandparents
for the (great-)grandchild's attention.
One great-grandmother interviewed, referred to
her great-grandchildren as 'my daughter's
grandchildren'. However, from the perspective
of adult great-grandchildren, the role of the great-grandparent
is not always so clear. Although
about one-third of great-grandchildren reported
having respect for their great-grandparents and
about a quarter seeing them as a teacher, over
half report having little to no contact with

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So far as contact is concerned, in Finland for
example, elderly people see great-grandchildren
much less frequently than grandchildren -
monthly compared to weekly (Ruoppila, 1991).
In the USA, a study found that one 92-year-old
great-grandmother saw some local great-grandchildren
weekly, but had never seen some
non-local great-grandchildren at all (Wentowski,
1985). In this study, even the youngest and
healthiest great-grandmothers (aged 66 and 71)
were not so involved with great-grandchildren as
with grandchildren. Health may be a factor in the
amount of contact between great-grandparents
and grandchildren, as are also proximity and the
quality of the relationship of and with the two
middle generations of parent and grandparent.


<b>AUTHORS' OVERVIEW</b>


<b><i>Future Directions forTheory
and Research in Grandparenting</i></b>


Despite much productive work and many interesting
findings, there are limitations to research
on grandparenting to date. In particular, a wider
range of methodologies might be usefully
employed. Most studies have employed interviews
or else structured or semi-structured questionnaires.
These may not always be reliable
indices of behaviour. A few studies of grandparental
relationships have used direct observation
of behaviour in standard situations. More
naturalistic home observations of grandparent-grandchild
interaction would be useful. So too
would be more projective or open-ended methods,
for example, analysis of essays children have
written about their grandparents or drawings
done by grandchildren of grandfathers and
grandmothers. Case studies and more qualitative
approaches can add important insights and complement
more quantitative results.


<b><i>Wider Cultural Comparisons</i></b>


With some exceptions, most research on grandparenthood
has been carried out in the USA. This
has included description of subcultural variations,
not only African-American families but
other ethnic groups. A greater number of comparable
studies of grandparenthood in different
cultures, including Eastern as well as Western,
non-industrial as well as urban, will give a more
generalizable and representative picture of the
variety of grandparenting.


<b><i>The Need forTheory</i></b>


Research in grandparenthood would benefit from
greater theoretical underpinning. Many articles
simply describe the amounts and kind of contact
between grandparents and grandchildren, the
influence of such factors as type of grandparent,
age of grandchild, proximity, and so forth. It is
important to get this descriptive information, but
also to look for a wider theoretical framework in
which to interpret the information. The use of
family systems theory (which has been used in
studies of grandchildren with disabilities) provides
one promising approach. Other possibilities
are attachment theory (in understanding
intergenerational transmission and conflict),
intergenerational solidarity (in understanding the
strength of the relationship between parents,
grandparents and grandchildren), and evolutionary
theory (in understanding kinship asymmetries).
Rather than seeing these perspectives as
opposed, it would be helpful to work towards
some expansion and integration (Smith and
Drew, 2002).


<b>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE</b>


<b><i>Grandparents in Society</i></b>


In the USA, there are now courses for grandparents.
These are aimed at educating grandparents
to help strengthen families. The components
include:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• sharing feelings and ideas with others,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• listening to the views of younger people,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• learning about lifespan development,
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• improving family communication skills, and
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• focusing self-evaluation.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
Education programmes have been used to evaluate
the needs of Mexican-American, Japanese
and Taiwanese grandparents. Interventions
following these programmes have been self-evaluated
and reported to be effective (Strom and
Strom, 1989).


• sharing feelings and ideas with others,


• listening to the views of younger people,


• learning about lifespan development,


• improving family communication skills, and


• focusing self-evaluation.


Grandparents who look after or 'parent' their
grandchildren are providing a service to their
communities as well as their families and need
support at a national and community level to
continue effectively. The American Association
of Retired Persons provides support, advice
and education to grandparent care-givers. The

There have also been attempts to enlist the
help of grandparents who were the primary caregivers
for children receiving mental health treatment.
There are intergenerational programmes
such as the Three Generation Project which aim
to help both new parents and grandparents cope
with shifts in family relationships that the transition
to (grand)parenthood brings. One study
described an evaluation of bringing grandparents
into family therapy sessions (Ingersoll-Dayton
and Neal, 1991).


There are also 'foster grandparent' programmes.
These attempt to enlist the help of the
elderly towards caring and companionship for a
'variety of high-risk children and youths'. In
some schemes, they receive a small, tax-free
payment. These take place in hospitals, residential
institutions, daycare programmes, and family
shelters. The evaluation of these programmes
appears to be positive (Werner, 1991). Clearly,
there is a burgeoning recognition of the importance
of grandparents as a community resource.
Thus, such initiatives are likely to spread.


<b><i>Obtaining Contact after Parental
Divorce: The Courts or Mediation?</i></b>


An important issue for grandparents is their
access and 'visitation rights' to grandchildren of a
non-custodial parent. A review in 1989 of the
then legal situation in the USA found that statutes
granting grandparents legal standing to petition
for legally enforceable visits to their grandchildren,
even over parental objections, had been
passed in all 50 states. However, in many states
these laws have since been rescinded due to parents
challenging the laws on the basis that the
statute is an infringement of their fundamental
constitutional right to raise their children as they
see fit. Contact orders are transferable from state
to state as of December 1998, when the Visitation
Rights Enforcement Act became law. In a recent
landmark decision, the US Supreme Court struck
down the law in Washington State that gave
grandparents rights to contact with their grandchildren.
This decision leans towards the rights of
parents against the rights of children and welfare
of children, who, as shown, benefit from grandparent
contact (Kornhaber, 1996).


In the UK, the 1989 Children Act highlights
the interests of children, and also allows any
person (not just grandparents or relatives) to
request a leave to seek an order for contact with
a child. When deciding whether to grant a leave,
the court will consider the applicant's connection
with the child. But even if the grandparent
has obtained a contact order, there is little that
holds the parent to abide by the court ruling.
Parents who defy the court can be held in contempt
and serve 28 days in prison. However, few
grandparents would wish to take such action and
risk their grandchildren being placed in care for
the duration of parents' imprisonment.
Additionally, this sort of action by the grandparent
would only increase the anger of the parents,
leaving the grandparent with less long-term
opportunity of seeing their grandchildren. All
these court proceedings are very expensive, and
often beyond the means of grandparents who
have retired and are on fixed incomes (Douglas
and Lowe, 1990).


There are considerable problems in using legal
measures, which are probably best seen as a lastresort
option, which even when granted may not
always be properly enforceable. Grandparents
often stress the importance of attempting nonlegal
forms of resolution first, such as mediation,
while opting for legal action as a final resort.
Mediation has been found to be effective in some
cases; however, sometimes legal contact orders
are the only way of preserving the child's continued
contact with their grandparent.


<b><i>Dos and Don'ts</i></b>


• DO develop a strong and long-lasting relationship
with your grandchild by <i>listening</i>
and <i>talking</i> to your grandchild.


• DO talk to your grandchild about family
history or 'When I was your age ..."


• DO promote the 'total family', to which all
three [or more] generations belong.


• DO use the telephone, letters and email
to maintain emotional closeness with
grandchildren.


• DO seek support from peers, support groups
or professionals if you find yourself raising
your grandchild in your home.


• DO keep the child's parents 'on board' and
informed of what you are doing.


• DON'T give up if your grandchild is not talk-ative.
Find a way to involve their parent to
stimulate conversation.


• DON'T let any negative characteristics of the
parent or your grandchild prevent the development
of a loving relationship.



[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

• DON'T miss out on the experience of being a
grandparent; most grandparents find it a very
rewarding experience which increases emotional
well-being.


• DON'T disrespect or disregard parents'
wishes while <i>listening</i> and <i>talking</i> to your
grandchildren.


• DON'T miss out on one-to-one interactions
directly to influence your grandchild through
childcare opportunities that meet you and
your adult child's needs.


• DON'T assume you have no rights to see
your grandchildren when there is a break-down
in the parents' relationship. Get information
from law centres, Citizens Advice
Bureaux, other information sources or the
internet regarding your rights.


• DON'T allow cultural differences between
you and your grandchildren to distort or damage
the relationship.


• DON'T treat your gay grandchild or the
child of your gay son or lesbian daughter
differently from your other grandchildren,
just because their sexual preferences are
different.


• DON'T expect the parents to help you accept
your grandchild's disability - it is your task,
if you want all the positive aspects of what
can still be a rewarding relationship


• DON'T feel you are taking over your
children's role by wanting to know your
grandchild or great-grandchild.
