<font size="4"><b>Chapter 1: Stress, Coping, and Health a Conceptual Overview</b></font>

<i>Brenda L. Lyon</i>


Although the term <i>stress</i> as it relates
to the human experience has
been in the scientific literature
since the 1930s and in the nursing literature
since the late 1950s, the word did not become
popular vernacular until the late 1970s and
early 1980s. Today, the term is used in everyday
vocabulary to capture a variety of human
experiences that are disturbing or disruptive in
some manner: "You wouldn't believe how
much stress I had today!" "I was really
stressed out."


Subjective sensations commonly experienced
in conjunction with "feeling stressed"
are headache, shortness of breath, light-headedness
or dizziness, nausea, muscle tension,
fatigue, gnawing in the gut, palpitations, loss
of appetite or hunger, and problems with
sleep. Behavioral manifestations of stress
commonly reported are crying, smoking, excessive
eating, drinking alcohol, fast talking,
and trembling. It is also commonplace for
people to complain that stress negatively affects
their functioning. It impairs concentration
ability, problem-solving ability, decision-making
ability, and the ability to get work
done (Goleman &amp; Gurin, 1993; Ornstein &amp;
Sobel, 1988; Pelletier, 1992, 1995).


The word "stress" began appearing in
nursing journals in 1956. Stress, as a construct,
was not widely recognized by nurse researchers
until the 1970s (Lyon &amp; Werner,
1987). Stress gained recognition as a phenomenon
of interest for nursing because anecdotal
data from patients and empirical evidence
from researchers suggested that stress and
health were inextricably related concepts.
Nursing, as a discipline, was not alone in recognizing
the importance that stress played in
health. Other health-related disciplines had already
begun to contribute to both theory development
and empirical testing of the phenomenon
of stress and its connection with
health.


Several different health-related disciplines
(e.g. , psychology, social psychology,

[p. <i>4</i>]

The experience of stress, particularly
chronic stress, takes a significant toll on the
well-being of individuals in terms of emotional
and physical discomforts as well as
functional ability. Health care utilization research
has repeatedly demonstrated that from
30% to 60% of all physician office visits are
for illness experiences that are nondisease
based with stress as the common contributor
(Cummings &amp; Vandenbos, 1981; Sobel,
1995). As early as 1982, the United States
Clearing House for Mental Health Information
reported that industry had lost $17 billion
in production capacity due primarily to stress-related
problems. In addition, it was estimated
in the late 1980s that $60 billion was lost annually
by businesses because of stress-related
physical illness (Matteson &amp; Ivancevich,
1987). It has been estimated that businesses
lose up to $150 billion per year due to stress-related
absenteeism, lost productivity, retraining,
and stress-related health care costs
(deCarteret, 1994).


Although it is commonly accepted that
stress affects health, all of the psychobiological
connections are not understood.
For example, why does a person who has had
an unpleasant interaction with his or her supervisor
develop a tension headache? Or why
does a woman who is struggling to balance
the demands of work and home develop stomach
pains every Monday morning? Theoretical
development in the area of stress, coping,
and health has been hampered by confusion
regarding each of the concepts.


The purpose of this chapter is to present
an overview of theoretical approaches to explaining
the concepts of stress, coping, and
health and their interrelationships with some
historical perspectives. Problems and issues
regarding the conceptualizations of each of
these constructs will be identified. Attention
will be paid to reconciling some of the diverse
conceptualizations of stress, coping, and
health for nursing.


- <b>THEORETICAL APPROACHES
TO DEFINING STRESS, COPING,
AND HEALTH</b>


In this section, I present an overview of the
conceptualizations of the stress and health
connection. The content regarding coping
will appear, as appropriate, in the presentation
of each of the major theoretical orientations
to stress. Discussion of each construct

<b><i>Stress as a Response</i></b>


The response-based orientation was initially
developed and examined by Hans Selye
and summarized in <i>The Stress of Life</i> (1956).
Selye was a pioneer in the development and
testing of theory pertinent to stress from a
physiological and medical perspective. As a
physician, he was intrigued by the common
inflammatory responses he observed in patients
regardless of their particular disease or
exposure to medical procedures. Many of
Selye's main concepts stemmed historically
from Cannon's (1932) notion that sympathoadrenal
changes were "emergency functions."


Selye viewed stress as a response to noxious
stimuli or environmental stressors and
defined it as the "nonspecific response of the
body to noxious stimuli" (Selye, 1956, p. 12).
He defined stress as a response, and it became
the dependent variable in stress research.
Selye's work focused on describing and explaining
a physiological response pattern
known as the general adaptation syndrome
(GAS). The following are the basic ideas in
Selye's theory: (a) The stress response (GAS)
was a defensive response that did not depend
on the nature of the stressor; (b) the GAS, as a
defense reaction, progressed in three well-defined
stages (alarm, resistance, and exhaustion);
and (c) if the GAS was severe and prolonged,
disease states could result (the so-called
diseases of adaptation). Selye (1956)
proposed that cognitive variables such as
"perception" played no role in contributing to
the initiation or moderation of the GAS. In his
1983 edition of <i>Stress of Life</i>, Selye extended
his thinking to include both negatively and
positively toned (eustress) experiences that
could be contributed to and moderated by
cognitive factors. It is important to note, however,
that Selye's basic theoretical premise
that stress was a physiological phenomenon
was not altered. In the absence of a modification
of his theory, it was not possible to explain
"psychological stress." This could not be
done in the context of a theory that was
strictly limited to physiology and neglected
cognitive-perceptual factors. In fact, problems
inherent in a normative or generalized response
theory were demonstrated when Mason
(1971, 1975a, 1975b) disconfirmed the
"nonspecificity" of physiological responses to
noxious stimuli in rats and monkeys.


Although Selye did not specifically address
the concept of coping in his work, his
notions of "defense" and "adaptation" are
conceptually similar to that of coping. The
alarm reaction phase of the GAS is triggered
when there is a noxious stimulus. This reaction
is characterized by sympathetic nervous
system stimulation. In the second phase, or
stage of resistance, physiologic forces are mobilized
to resist damage from the noxious
stimulus. Often, the stage of resistance leads
to adaptation or the improvement or disappearance
of symptoms and does not progress
to the third stage of exhaustion. The stage of
resistance can also lead to diseases of adaptation,
such as hypertension, arthritis, and cancer.
Exhaustion occurs when the stressor is
prolonged or sufficiently severe to use up all
remaining adaptive energy. It is important to
note that Selye conceptualized adaptive energy
as limited by an individual's genetics.
That is, each individual is proposed to have a
certain amount of adaptive energy, similar to
a bank account, from which he or she can
withdraw but cannot deposit. When adaptive
energy is depleted, death ensues (Selye,
1983).


Much of the response-based research on
stress has used animal models with the intent
of extrapolating results to humans. There have
been many attempts to measure the stress response
in humans using such indices as heart
rate, blood pressure, plasma and urinary
Cortisol, and antibody production. As Lindsey
(1993) correctly noted, however, it is not possible
to capture the proposed "stress response"

[p. <i>6</i>]

There are several theoretical, measurement,
and practice-related problems with defining
stress as a nonspecific response to noxious
stimuli or, as Selye (1983) stated, to any
stress-inducing demand or stressor. First, the
generality of the definition as the sum of all
nonspecific reactions of the body obscures the
more specific response patterns of psycho-physiological
responses. As early as 1957,
Schachter demonstrated differential autonomic
responses for anger and anxiety.


In 1967, Arnold summarized the empirical
evidence of how the physiological correlates
of anger and fear differed. Fear demonstrates
primarily an adrenergic effect, whereas
anger demonstrates primarily a cholinergic effect.
By the mid-1970s, there was evidence
that a single emotion such as anxiety could
trigger different physiological responses depending
on how a person coped with it
(Schalling, 1976).


Second, Selye uses the term <i>stressor</i> to
refer to the "noxious" condition that triggers
the response and the term <i>stress</i> to refer to
both the initial impact of the stressor (alarm
reaction) on tissues and the adaptive mechanisms
that are a reaction to the stressor. In addition,
conceptual confusion about the meaning
of the term stress was heightened because
Selye sometimes defined stress as the wear
and tear, damage, or disease consequences of
prolonged GAS responses. Third, the absence
of cognitive factors such as appraisal and
meaning shortchanged what occurred in psychological
stress. Fourth, the normative nature
of the nonspecific physiological response pattern
or GAS does not allow for individual differences
in perception of a stimulus situation
or how a person uniquely copes with a threatening
situation.


In a classic study, Ursin, Baade, and Levine
(1978) demonstrated that effective coping
behavior produced a significant reduction
in physiological activation. Their study of
parachutist trainees found that general ability
level, defense mechanisms, motivation, and
role identification explained "considerable
portions" of the variance in stress response.
Increased activation of the pituitary
adrenocortical axis was positively correlated
only with defense mechanisms and low performance,
whereas Cortisol levels returned to
baseline as coping processes were established.
In general, the Ursin et al. study supports
the idea that an individual's perception
of a threatening situation and his or her coping
behavior are the primary determinants of the
neuroendocrine response pattern. Fifth, the
measurement of stress as a dependent variable
must be operationalized by physiological
variables. It has long been known that there is
a disassociation between subjective experiences
and objective signs of both the central
and the autonomic nervous systems (Lacy,
1967). Sixth, in terms of adoption of the theory
to guide nursing practice, the assumptions
underlying the theory are not compatible with
nursing's philosophical presuppositions, rendering
its application to nursing practice awkward
at best. Specifically, the presupposition
that each individual is unique and that perception
or meaning is central to personal experiences
are not compatible with Selye's propositions.


In their critical review of nursing research
on stress, Lyon and Werner (1987) noted that
from 1974 to 1984 approximately 24% of the
studies used a response framework to study
stress. As noted earlier, the use of the response
framework necessitated that stress be the dependent
variable—it is the disruption caused
by a noxious stimulus or stressor. Commonly,
stress was operationalized in nursing research
by both psychological and physiological measures.
Physiological measures were typically
vital signs (Guzetta &amp; Forsyth, 1979), urinary
Na:K ratio and 17-ketosteroids (Far, Keene,
Samson, &amp; Michael, 1984), cardiovascular
complaints (Schwartz &amp; Brenner, 1979), anxiety
(Guzetta &amp; Forsyth, 1979), or all these.
Most of the research studies critically reviewed
by Lyon and Werner used independent
variables such as relaxation (Tamez, Moore,
&amp; Brown, 1978) or information (Toth, 1980)
that were purported to mediate between the
stressor (commonly assumed to be hospitalization,

[p. <i>7</i>]

Contrary to Selye's GAS theory, studies
of stress using the response-based orientation
to stress in humans indicate that stress is stimulus-
or situation-specific and subject to individual
response. Although there is no empirical
support for the "nonspecific and uniform
response" to the noxious stimuli postulate in
humans, there is abundant evidence that a person's
perception of an event and his or her
coping behaviors do vary in physiological
correlates.


<b><i>Stress as a Stimulus</i></b>


In the 1960s, psychologists became interested
in applying the concept of stress to psychological
experiences. Masuda and Holmes
(1967) and Holmes and Rahe (1967), stimulated
by their interest in what happens when a
person experiences "change" in life circumstances,
proposed a stimulus-based theory of
stress. The stimulus approach treats life
changes or "life events" as the stressor to
which a person responds. Therefore, unlike
the response-based model, stress is the independent
variable in research.


The work of the aforementioned researchers
resulted in the development of tools
known as the Social Readjustment Rating
Scale (SRRS) and Schedule of Recent Experiences
(Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967). Both tools
were purported to measure stress defined and
operationalized as the adjustment required by
selected major life changes or events. The
central proposition of the stimulus model is
that too many life changes increase one's vulnerability
to illness. The SRRS consisted of
42 life events (e.g. , marriage, loss of a loved
one, pregnancy, vacation, divorce, retirement,
and change in residence) that were assigned a
priori weights derived from the mean ratings
of the estimated amount of adjustment the
events would require (Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967).
In their early research with Navy recruits, the
researchers demonstrated a small but significant
relationship between adaptation scores
(assigned to different events) and illness experiences
during the subsequent year.


The stimulus-based model was built on
assumptions that are inherently problematic in
explaining human phenomenon. The primary
theoretical proposition was based on the
premise that (a) life changes are normative
and that each life change results in the same
readjustment demands for all persons, (b)
change is stressful regardless of the desirability
of the event to the person, and (c) there is a
common threshold of readjustment or adaptation
demands beyond which illness results.
During their early work, Holmes and Rahe
viewed the person as a passive recipient of
stress. Furthermore, stress was conceptualized
as an additive phenomenon that was measurable
by researcher-selected life events that
had preassigned normative weights. Later in
their work, however, the researchers incorporated
consideration of a person's interpretation
of the life event as a negative or positive
experience (Rahe, 1978).


During the 1970s, hundreds of studies
were conducted on the ability of life event
scores to predict illness. Illness was typically
operationalized as morbidity or disease states.
Collectively, these studies have consistently
accounted for not more than 4% to 6% of the
incidence of illness with low correlations of
.20 to .30 (Johnson &amp; Sarason, 1979a). One
important explanation for why the low correlations
reached statistical significance is that
sample sizes in these studies were typically
very large. The low correlations may also simply
reflect the fact that people commonly experience
stress that is not related to major life
changes.


Sarason, Johnson, and Seigel (1979) developed
a different measure, the Life Experiences
Survey (LES), that not only incorporated
the person's view of whether the life
event was desirable or undesirable but also incorporated
the degree of impact the event had
on the individual's life. This 57-item self-report
measure has been widely used in life
stress studies. Despite the fact that development

[p. <i>8</i>]

An important study, disconfirming the
central postulate of the stimulus-based approach,
was conducted by Kobasa in 1979.
She introduced the notion of "hardiness" as an
important moderator variable. Initially, hardiness
was described as (a) a strong commitment
to self, (b) a vigorous attitude toward the
environment, (c) a sense of meaningfulness,
and (d) an internal locus of control. Kobasa
operationalized these elements by using several
different extant surveys, including the Internal-External
Locus of Control Scale,
Alienation Test, and Achievement Scale of the
Personality Research Form. In a study of 837
middle- and upper-level executives, the findings
showed that those with higher hardiness
had lower illness scores despite scoring higher
on significant life events (SRRS). Executives
who had higher SRRS scores and low hardiness
scores, however, had significantly more
illness. Kobasa demonstrated that hardiness
was a powerful moderator between stress,
measured by SRRS, and illness.


Although Kobasa (1979) found a mediating
effect for hardiness on the relationship between
life events and health outcomes, there
have been inconsistent findings in other studies.
Manning, Williams, and Wolfe (1988)
found hardiness, rather than acting as a mediator
between stress and health outcomes, to
have direct effects on emotional and psychological
factors thought to be related to wellbeing
and work performance. These included
a higher quality of life, more positive affect,
and fewer somatic complaints.


A construct closely related to hardiness
but different enough to be a more powerful
mediator between life event stress and illness
is sense of coherence (Antonovsky, 1987).
Sense of coherence (SOC) is characterized by
(a) comprehensibility—the degree to which a
situation is predictable and explicable, (b)
manageability—the availability of sufficient
resources (internal and external) to meet the
demands of the situation, and (c) meaningfulness
— the degree to which life's demands
are worth the investment of energy. A person
with a high SOC has a tendency to view the
world as ordered, predictable, and manageable.
Importantly, Antonovsky (1982) argued
that we often ask the wrong question—that is,
"Why do people become ill?"—when perhaps
we should be asking "Why do people stay
healthy despite life stress?"


Notwithstanding the dominance of the
stimulus approach to studying the relationship
between life event stress and illness (disease)
in the 1970s and early 1980s, the effectiveness
of this paradigm in explaining the relationship
between stress and illness was not confirmed.
In an attempt to come to grips with the issues
regarding a priori weighted measures of major
life events, Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, and Lazarus
(1981) proposed a measure of chronic
daily hassles and uplifts—the Hassles Scale
consisting of 117 items and the Uplifts Scale
containing 135 items. Hassles are "relatively
minor" daily experiences and demands that
are appraised as potentially threatening or
harmful, and uplifts are favorable experiences
and events. On the Hassles Scale, respondents
indicate whether or not an occurrence of any
of the items "hassled or bothered" them
within the past week or month and, if so,
whether the hassle was "somewhat," "moderately,"
or "extremely" severe. Similarly, on the
Uplifts Scale, respondents indicate if they experienced
an item as an uplift (a positive
event) and, if so, to what extent was it strong
("somewhat," "moderate," or "extremely").
Using the Hassles Scale and a life events
questionnaire, Delongis, Coyne, Dakof,
Folkman, and Lazarus (1982) were able to
demonstrate, through a multiple regression

[p. <i>9</i>]

In 1987, Lyon and Werner noted that approximately
30% of the nursing research on
stress from 1974 to 1984 used a stimulus-based
or life event approach. In fact, Volicer
and Bohannon (1975) adapted the SRRS to
stressful events of hospitalization and developed
the Hospital Stress Rating Scale
(HSRS). Consistent with findings from other
disciplines, the correlations between life event
or HSRS scores and physical or mental disruption
were small in magnitude (<i>r</i> = .20-.28).
By the late 1980s, the stimulus-based approach
to defining and measuring stress without
appraisal had fallen out of favor in nursing.


In 1993, Werner significantly modified
and extended the notion that stress and health-related
responses were triggered from events.
She proposed a framework to examine trigger
events or stimuli that result in the experience
of stress or significant physical or psychosocial
reaction. Werner labeled the trigger
event a "stressor" and proposed that there are
four types of stressors: event, situation, conditions,
and cues. An <i>event</i> is something noteworthy
that happens. A <i>situation</i> is composed
of a combination of circumstances at any
given moment. A <i>condition</i> is a state of being,
and a cue is a feature indicating the nature of
something perceived (Table 1.1). In addition
to identifying types of stressors, Werner identified
ways to categorize stressors with respect
to locus (internal or external), duration and
temporality (acute, time limited; chronic, intermittent;
and chronic), forecasting (predictable
or unpredictable), tone (positive or negative),
and impact (normative or catastrophic).
Integrating these elements, Werner proposed
an organizing schema for stressor research in
nursing. Although it is unlikely that specific
responses to stressors in any of the categories
proposed by Werner would be the same across
individuals, it might be possible to identify
common themes within specified categories
in similar cultures.


<b><i>Stress as a
Transaction</i></b>


As a social-personality psychologist,
Richard Lazarus became interested in explaining
the dynamics of troublesome experiences.
He developed and tested a transactional
model of stress (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &amp;
Folkman, 1984). Lazarus believed that stress
as a concept had heuristic value, but in and of
itself was not measurable as a single variable.
Lazarus (1967) contended that stress does not
exist in the "event" but rather is a result of a
transaction between a person and his or her
environment. As such, stress encompasses a
set of cognitive, affective, and coping variables.


Precursor models to Lazarus's transactional
model of stress include those proposed
by Basowitz, Persky, Korchin, and
Grinker (1955), Mechanic (1962), and Janis
(1954). Each of these models, although different
in many ways, shared some commonalties.
Basowitz et al. defined stress as feelings that
typically occur when an organism is threatened.
In Mechanic's model of stress, it is defined
as "discomforting responses of persons
in particular situations" (p. 7). The factors
proposed to influence whether or not a situation
is experienced as discomforting include
the abilities or capacities of the person, skills
and constraints produced by group practices
and traditions, resources available to the person
in the environment, and norms that define
where and how the individual could be comfortable
in using the means available. Behavior
that a person uses to respond to demands is
termed <i>coping behavior</i>. Janis (1954) proposed
a model of disaster that included three
major phases of stress: (a) the threat phase, in
which persons perceive objective signs of
danger; (b) the danger impact phase, in which
the danger is proximal and the chance of the

Due in part to the early works of all the
aforementioned researchers, by the 1960s
stress had become a popular construct in psychological
and psychosomatic research. Including
his own research findings, Lazarus's
1966 book, <i>Psychological Stress and the
Coping Process</i>, represents an elegant theoretical
integration of all the research findings on
stress and its interrelationship with health
through the early 1960s. The theoretical
framework that Lazarus presented to explain
the complex phenomenon of stress was a major
impetus for the field of cognitive
psychology because his framework consistently
emphasized the important role that "appraisal"
plays in how a person reacts, feels,
and behaves.


Lazarus (1967) and Lazarus and Folkman
(1984) asserted that the primary mediator of
person-environment transactions was appraisal.
Three types of appraisal were identified:
primary, secondary, and reappraisal. <i>Primary
appraisal</i> is a judgment about what the person
perceives a situation holds in store for him or
her. Specifically, a person assesses the possible
effects of demands and resources on wellbeing.
If the demands of a situation outweigh
available resources, then the individual may
determine that the situation represents (a) a
potential for harm or loss (threat) or that (b)
actual harm has already occurred (harm) or
(c) the situation has potential for some type of
gain or benefit (challenge). It is important to
note, however, that the perception of challenge
in the absence of perceived potential for
harm was not considered a stress appraisal.

[p. <i>11</i>]

The perception of threat triggers <i>secondary
appraisal</i>, which is the process of determining
what coping options or behaviors are
available to deal with a threat. Often, primary
and secondary appraisals occur simultaneously
and interact with one another, which
makes measurement very difficult (Lazarus &amp;
Folkman, 1984).


<i>Reappraisal</i> is the process of continually
evaluating, changing, or relabeling earlier primary
or secondary appraisals as the situation
evolves. What was initially perceived as
threatening may now be viewed as a challenge
or as benign or irrelevant. Often, reappraisal
results in the cognitive elimination of perceived
threat.


There are many situational factors that influence
appraisals of threat, including their
number and complexity; person's values,
commitments, and goals; availability of resources;
novelty of the situation; self-esteem;
social support; coping skills; situational constraints;
degree of uncertainty and ambiguity;
proximity (time and space), intensity, and
duration of the threat; and the controllability
of the threat. What occurs during appraisal
processes determines emotions and
coping behaviors (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &amp;
Folkman, 1984).


Other important concepts in Lazarus's
transactional framework for stress include
coping and stress emotions. Unlike the response-based
or stimulus-based orientation to
stress discussed earlier, the transactional
model explicitly includes coping efforts.
Coping is defined as "constantly changing
cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage
specific external and/or internal demands that
are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources
of the person" (Lazarus &amp; Folkman,
1984, p. 141). This definition clearly deems
coping as a process-oriented phenomenon,
not a trait or an outcome, and makes it clear
that such effort is different from automatic
adaptive behavior that has been learned. Furthermore,
coping involves "managing" the
stressful situation; therefore, it does not necessarily
mean "mastery." Managing may include
efforts to minimize, avoid, tolerate,
change, or accept a stressful situation as a person
attempts to master or handle his or her
environment.


Lazarus and Folkman (1984) warned
against "stage"-type models of coping because
they tend to create situations in which a
person's behavior is judged to be inside or
outside the norm by the way the person deals
with a stressful situation over time. A common
example of a stage model is that proposed
by Kubler-Ross (1969) for death and
dying. It is not uncommon for health care providers
to inappropriately judge a person's
grief response because of the expectation that
a person must experience all the predicted
stages and only cycle through them one time.
Although there may be commonalties or patterns
in certain situations that are similar in
terms of both the nature of the situation and
the cultural ways of responding, there is probably
not a dominant pattern of coping.


In 1966, Lazarus identified two forms of
coping: direct action and palliative. In 1984,
Lazarus and Folkman changed the names of
these two forms to problem-focused and emotion-focused,
respectively. <i>Problem-focused
coping</i> strategies are similar to problem-solving
tactics. These strategies encompass efforts
to define the problem, generate alternative solutions,
weigh the costs and benefits of various
actions, take actions to change what is
changeable, and, if necessary, learn new
skills. Problem-focused efforts can be directed
outward to alter some aspect of the environment
or inward to alter some aspect of
self. Many of the efforts directed at self fall
into the category of reappraisals—for example,
changing the meaning of the situation or
event, reducing ego involvement, or recognizing
the existence of personal resources or
strengths.


<i>Emotion-focused coping</i> strategies are directed
toward decreasing emotional distress.
These tactics include such efforts as distancing,
avoiding, selective attention, blaming,
minimizing, wishful thinking, venting emotions,
seeking social support, exercising, and
meditating. Similar to the cognitive strategies
identified in problem-focused coping efforts,

[p. <i>12</i>]

Lazarus (1966) and Lazarus and Folkman
(1984) summarize a large body of empirical
evidence supporting the distinction between
emotion (palliative) and problem-focused (direct-action)
coping. In addition, the evidence
indicates that everyone uses both types of
strategies to deal with stressful encounters or
troublesome external or internal demands.


Folkman (1997), based on her work in
studying AIDS-related caregiving, proposed
an extension of the model regarding the theoretical
understanding of coping. Her study involved
measurement of multiple variables of
psychological state (depressive symptomatology,
positive states, and positive and negative
affect), coping, and religious or spiritual
beliefs and activities. Each caregiver participant
was interviewed twice. Although participants
reported a high level of negative psychological
states as expected, they also reported
high levels of positive affect. Interestingly, the
interview data, when examined along with
quantitative analyses, revealed that the coping
strategies associated with positive psychological
states had a common theme: "searching
for and finding positive meaning. Positive reappraisal,
problem-focused coping, spiritual
beliefs and practices, and infusing ordinary
events with positive meaning all involve the
activation of beliefs, values, or goals that help
define the positive significance of events" (p.
1215). Folkman cites many studies that support
her conclusion that finding positive
meaning in a stressful situation is linked to the
experience of well-being.


Another important construct in Lazarus's
(1966, 1991) transactional model is emotion
—specifically emotions that are considered
to be stress emotions. These include, but
are not limited to, anxiety, fear, anger, guilt,
and sadness (Lazarus, 1991, 1966; Lazarus &amp;
Folkman, 1984). Lazarus (1991) does not treat
depression as an emotion but rather as a composite
of several stress emotions, including
anxiety, anger, sadness, and guilt.


Lazarus and Folkman (1984) present cogent
arguments for the explanatory power of
the cognitive theory of emotion. Although
thoughts proceed emotions—that is, emotions
are shaped by thought processes—emotions
can in turn affect thoughts. The primary appraisal
of threat and the specific meaning of
the situation to the person trigger a particular
stress emotion consistent with the meaning.


Lazarus (1966) and Lazarus and Folkman
(1984) link stress-related variables to health-related
outcomes. All of their constructs in the
transactional model, when taken together, affect
adaptational outcomes. Lazarus and
Folkman propose three types of adaptational
outcomes: (a) functioning in work and social
living, (b) morale or life satisfaction, and (c)
somatic health. They view the concept of
health broadly to encompass physical (somatic
conditions, including illness and physical
functioning), psychological (cognitive
functional ability and morale—including positive
and negative effects regarding how people
feel about themselves and their life, including
life satisfaction), and social (social
functioning) (Table 1.2).


- <b>THE CONCEPT OF HEALTH</b>


Each of the three theoretical perspectives on
stress incorporate proposed links between
stress and health. It is clear that both the stimulus-based
and the response-based models
were developed based on a biomedical orientation
to health in which illness is operationalized
as disease and health is viewed as the

[p. <i>14</i>]

"Health" is an elusive term. It is a term
that many people think they understand until
they are asked to define or describe it and then
asked how they would measure it. Health has
been described as a value judgment, as an objective
state, as a subjective state, as a continuum
from illness to wellness, and as a utopian
state (rarely achievable). Contributing to the
confusion about health are the related concepts
wellness, well-being, and quality of life.


Despite the common origin of the word
health from "hoelth," an Old English word
meaning safe or sound and whole of body
(Dolfman, 1973), there is no one contemporary
meaning for the term. During the twentieth
century, many attempts have been made
by the lay community to define health in a
manner that has broad applicability. These
global definitions, however, are confusing and
make it difficult, if not impossible, to clearly
operationalize. This confusion has particularly
important ramifications when one considers
that health is a target goal shared by
many professions and the federal government.


The health-related professions offer definitions
of health that give rise to discipline-specific
foci for diagnosis and treatment. Such
definitions are not necessarily problematic. In
fact, these differences have probably contributed
to targeted and efficient efforts to generate
knowledge about different aspects of the
human condition. However, there are three
important problems with discipline-specific
definitions for which we must use caution.


The first is that discipline-specific perspectives
partition the holistic phenomenon of
health in such a manner that the whole picture
of a person's condition and how the person is
feeling and doing is lost. The second is that
too often the discipline's perspective on health
is adopted by other disciplines when there is
not a good match in terms of the disciplines'
philosophical presuppositions and social mandate.
An excellent example is the nursing field
adopting the medical model definition of
health as the absence of disease. A third problem
is that the acceptance of a discipline-specific
view of health by policy-making groups
necessarily leads to health policy decisions
that may not be in the best interest of the population
as a whole.


<i>The Biomedical View of Health</i>


The most popular and widely held view
of health is the biomedical view. Medicine has
traditionally viewed health from an objective
stance and defines it as the absence of disease
or discernible pathology and defines illness as
the presence of same (Engel, 1992; Kleinman,
1981; Millstein &amp; Irwin, 1987). On the basis
of this perspective, medicine's social mandate
has been the diagnosis and treatment of
disease. Public health professionals and government
agencies commonly adopt the biomedical
model and use morbidity and mortality
statistics as an index of the population's
health.


The biomedical model, as noted by
Antonovsky (1979), is a dichotomous model.
Consistent with this perspective, a person who
has a chronic disease cannot have health or be
considered well. Furthermore, a logical extension
of the dichotomous model is that a person
cannot be healthy in the presence of disease.


<i><b>Nursing's View of Health</b></i>


Nursing has been critical of the narrow
confines of the biomedical model as a model
for nursing practice and its adoption by government
agencies (Hall &amp; Allan, 1987;
Leininger, 1994; Lyon, 1990). Many nurses in
practice and nurse educators, however, commonly
adopt the biomedical view and equate
illness and disease using the terms interchangeably.
Likewise, concepts of health and
wellness are used interchangeably, resulting
in the conclusion that persons who have
chronic diseases are not and cannot be well.
Because health and wellness are targeted outcomes,
it is imperative that nursing be clear on
how it defines these concepts. This is particularly
important in developing theoretical models

[p. <i>15</i>]

Currently, there is little unity regarding a
definition of health as a central concept for
nursing. Considered an essential ingredient of
nursing's theoretical metaparadigm (i.e., person,
environment, health, and nursing), nurse
theorists have elected to define health in the
context of their proposed models. Florence
Nightingale (1860/1969) wrote that health is
"not only to be well, but to be able to use well
every power we have to use" (p. 26). Although
one cannot be sure what Nightingale actually
meant by the word "well," Selanders (1995)
argues she meant "being the best you can be at
any given point in time" (p. 26). This allows
for an individual to be healthy even if not
medically well. Some additional light is shed
on the meaning of wellness because it is clear
that Nightingale viewed disease and illness as
distinctly different phenomena. It is interesting
to speculate that if Florence Nightingale
were writing <i>Notes on Nursing</i> today, she
most certainly would have included stress as
one of the many nondiseased-based causes of
symptoms experienced by patients.


Tripp-Reimer (1984) proposes a two-dimensional
health state with an <i>etic</i> perspective
(disease-nondisease) that reflects an objective
interpretation of health data and an
<i>emic</i> perspective (wellness-illness) that represent
the subjective experience. Four health
states are possible within her model. Tripp-Reimer
proposes that this approach is particularly
useful cross-culturally when perceptions
of heath state differ between scientifically educated
providers and the client. Newman
(1986) views health as the totality of life processes
that are evolving toward expanded consciousness.
Man represents only one stage of
this evolution. Orem (1995) distinguishes
health and wellness. She defines health as a
state characterized by soundness or wholeness
of human structure and bodily and mental
functions. Wellness, she notes, is a state characterized
by experiences of contentment,
pleasure, and movement toward maturation
and achievement of the human potential (personalization).
Engagement in self-care facilitates
this process of personalization. Other
nurses offering conceptualizations of health
include Henderson (1966), King (1981), Lyon
(1990), Newman (1986), Parse (1992), Paterson
and Zderad (1976), Peplau (1952, 1988),
and Rogers (1970). Health is defined in many
ways within the discipline of nursing (Table
1.3). Commonly shared attributes of health inherent
in these definitions, however, include
that it is a subjective experience that encompasses
how a person is feeling and doing.
These commonly shared attributes are apparent
in Keller's (1981) analysis of definitions
of health. A subjective orientation to defining
health is quite different from the medical definition
of health as an objective phenomenon
manifested by the absence of disease or pathology.


Regarding the possibility of a single definition
of health for nursing, Meleis (1990)
points out that, "although diversity should be
accepted and reinforced, there is a need for
unity in perspective that represents the territory
of investigation, the territory for theoretical
development" (p. 109). This unity in
perspective would also help to shape the target
goals of nursing's unique contributions to society
and could serve as a practical guideline
for assessment, diagnosis, and intervention.
The importance of using a definition of health
that can be operationalized and used to
guide nursing practice cannot be overemphasized.


A nursing-oriented definition of health
consistent with the theme that health is a subjective
phenomenon that is operationalizable
has been proposed by Lyon (1990). Lyon defined
health as a subjective representation of a
person's composite evaluation of somatic
sense of self (how one is feeling) and functional
ability (how one is doing). As such,
health is manifested in the subjective judgment
that one is experiencing wellness or illness.
These subjective experiences are dynamic
and are an outgrowth of person and

[p. <i>16</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086815-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Illness</i> is defined by Lyon (1990) as the
subjective experience of somatic discomfort
(emotional or physical or both) that is accompanied
by some degree of functional decline
below the person's perceived capability level.
Illness occurs on a continuum from low ("I'm
not feeling well.") to high ("I'm very ill or
sick."). The experience of somatic discomfort
and a decline in functional ability can be the
consequence of both disease- and, importantly
for nursing, nondisease-based factors
that are amenable to nursing interventions
(Figures 1.1 and 1.2).


Nursing's unique health-related contribution
to society is the diagnosis and treatment

Linking Nursing Interventions to Health Outcomes</div>

<i>Wellness</i> is characterized by Lyon (1990)
as the experience of somatic comfort (emotional
and physical) and a functional ability
level at or near the person's perceived capability
level. There is an abundance of research to
demonstrate that people commonly judge
themselves to feel well even in the presence of
chronic, debilitating, or life-threatening diseases
when they are somatically comfortable
and can function at their perceived capability
level (Dasback, Klein, Klein, &amp; Moss, 1994;
Long &amp; Weinert, 1992; Okun, Zautra, &amp; Robinson,
1988; Stuifbergen, Becker, Ingalsbe, &amp;
Sands, 1990). Evaluation of somatic sense of
self and functional ability is ongoing and can
change from moment to moment. The important
distinction in Lyon's (1990) definition of
functional ability is that a person's subjective
evaluation of functional ability is a comparison
between what the person believes is his or
her capability level and what he or she is actually
able to do. This orientation allows for adjustments
of perceived capability downward
or upward. Therefore, during the early phases

[p. <i>19</i>]

Some in nursing may, at first glance, be
concerned about using a subjective definition
of health as a framework to guide nursing
practice. That is, what do you do with the person
who has diagnosed hypertension or diabetes
and yet perceives himself or herself as
well? Nothing? Of course not. It is important
to note, however, that the individual with hypertension
or diabetes may not do anything
unless he or she deems the actions (e.g., taking
medications and controlling diet and
weight) as both salient and important. Helping
patients to elevate and to maximize their
awareness of slight somatic discomforts (e.g.,
tiredness) or slight problems with functional
ability (e.g. , thinking clearly) can be beneficial
in stimulating therapeutic self-care action
(Figure 1.2).


The understanding that both illness and
wellness can be experienced in the presence
or absence of disease and that nursing's
unique contribution is focusing on the diagnosis
and treatment of nondisease-based factors
contributing to illness is a fundamental cornerstone
of nursing. Grasping this idea is what
makes it possible for nurses to see possibilities
for patients to experience wellness in the
presence of a chronic or life-threatening disease
or both. Knowledge about nondisease-based
factors, such as stress, that contribute to
somatic (physical or emotional) discomfort
and declines in functional ability increases a
nurse's repertoire of intervention possibilities
to help patients. It is imperative that the nursing
discipline adopt or develop measurements
of health outcomes to demonstrate the efficacy
of stress- and coping-related nursing interventions.
In Chapter 23, Lyon and Rice
present a conceptual model for nursing that
links stress, coping, and health.
