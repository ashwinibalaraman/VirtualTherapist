<font size="4"><b>Chapter 14: Psychopathology</b></font>

Analyses of psychopathology among Asian Americans usually involve
a series of questions that increase in complexity. For example,
one can start with a basic question—What are the rates of mental disorders
among Asian Americans?—and generate a whole set of more complex questions:
Are Asian Americans at increased risk for mental illness? Does culture affect how
Asian Americans experience stressors and psychopathology? Do Asian Americans
exhibit unique patterns of symptom expression? How are rates of mental disorders
determined, and are assessment and diagnostic procedures valid for Asian
Americans?


This chapter addresses these questions by reviewing the current state of research
on Asian Americans, which, in many respects, remains quite limited. For
heuristic purposes, we propose a multicomponent model for the analysis of psychopathology
among Asian Americans. The components of this model include
(a) Vulnerability (biopsychosocial considerations that increase or decrease risk
for psychopathology, (b) Experience (the cognitive and emotional organization
of psychopathology), (c) Manifestation (symptom expression of psychopathology),
and (d) Prevalence (the extent of psychopathology in the population). In
positing a Vulnerability-Experience-Manifestation-Prevalence model, we have

Conceptual Model for the Analysis of Psychopathology</div>

<i>Vulnerability</i> encompasses those person and environmental factors that contribute
to the development of psychopathology. According to the diathesis-stress
model (Meehl, 1962; Rosenthal, 1970), certain environmental stressors may activate
an inherent predisposition or diathesis to illness. This model has particular
relevance for Southeast Asian refugees given their repeated exposure to catastrophic
environmental stressors such as premigration war trauma. Furthermore,
many Southeast Asian refugees have experienced multiple life changes in their
native lands, during migration, and on resettlement in the United States that might
compound their risk for psychopathology. Past research shows that undesirable
life changes are correlated with anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms (Sarason,
Johnson, &amp; Siegel, 1978). Research also has demonstrated that genetic factors
may contribute to certain psychiatric disorders such as panic disorder (Crowe,
Noyes, Pauls, &amp; Slymen, 1983; Torgersen, 1983), unipolar and bipolar mood
disorders (Goodwin &amp; Guze, 1984), and schizophrenia (Kendler, 1983, 1988).
Is it possible that Asian Americans possess unique genetic or biological risk factors
for psychopathology? Research is far from conclusive, but investigators have found
significant psychobiological differences between Asians and Whites in their reactivity
to alcohol (Akutsu, Sue, Zane, &amp; Nakamura, 1989) and psychopharmacological
agents (Lin, Lau et al., 1988; Lin, Poland, Nuccio et al., 1989;
Lin, Poland, &amp; Lesser, 1986) that eventually might help clarify the role of psychobiology
in the etiology of mental illness among Asians.


A preexisting vulnerability coupled with environmental stressors may lead
to the <i>Experience</i> of mental illness. Kleinman (1988) asserted that individuals
conceptualize the nature and causes of psychopathology in terms of culturally
embedded "explanatory models" of mental illness. In support of this notion,
research illustrates that Asian Americans may organize and perceive mental health
in a culturally distinct manner. Asian cultures hold unique conceptualizations,
nomenclature, and coping responses that often challenge Western perspectives
of mental health. Such cultural differences are especially noteworthy for recently
arrived Asian Americans who organize their concepts of mental health around
traditional folk beliefs, as will be seen later in this chapter.


<i>Manifestation</i> is closely linked to Experience and constitutes the expression
and course of psychopathology. It is widely recognized that symptom presentations

[p. <i>459</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00470&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Lastly, <i>Prevalence</i> focuses on the actual reported rates of psychopathology
among Asian Americans. Determining the prevalence of psychopathology among
Asian Americans is a formidable task given that large-scale epidemiological studies
have not been conducted in this ethnic population. Prevalence estimates based
on use of mental health services have been misleadingly low because Asian Americans
tend to underutilize such services. Furthermore, numerous assessment and
diagnostic instruments that are used in prevalence studies emphasize Western
health concepts and, therefore, might lack construct validity for Asian Americans.
The development and theoretical basis of culture-specific instruments and their
contribution to the assessment and diagnosis of Asian Americans are examined
in this chapter.


In summary, the components of the Vulnerability-Experience-Manifestation-Prevalence
model are logically linked. Vulnerability factors may contribute to the
development of psychopathology, whereas the cognitive and emotional responses
to these factors comprise the experience of mental illness. In turn, experience
affects how psychopathology is manifested, and the manifestation of disorders
forms the basis for prevalence estimates. As will be seen throughout this chapter,
cultural factors and/or minority group status are intimately involved in all of
these processes for Asian Americans.


Before discussing the research literature, two caveats are in order. First, research
on overseas Asians is included in this chapter despite the psychological,
sociopolitical, and economic differences they might have with their Asian American
counterparts. In many respects, however, these two groups are culturally
similar, and the abundant studies on overseas Asians have made major conceptual
contributions to the study of Asian American health. Second, heterogeneity exists
among Asian American groups. It is difficult to appreciate this heterogeneity because
many Asian American groups are overlooked in research, and findings from
one group often are generalized to the entire population.


<b>VULNERABILITY</b>


Are Asian Americans at increased risk for psychopathology? Past research strongly
suggests that this is indeed the case for certain segments of the Asian American

[p. <i>460</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00471&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Research on newborn infants further highlights ethnic differences in the psychobiology
of Asians and Caucasians. Freedman (1975) compared 24 Chinese
American newborns to 24 Caucasian American newborns according to five categories:
(a) temperament, (b) sensory development, (c) autonomic and central
nervous system maturity, (d) motor development, and (e) social interest and response.
Although a substantial overlap among all infants was found along these
five categories, the two groups significantly differed on items measuring temperament
and on those that appeared to assess excitability/imperturbability. The
Chinese American newborns tended to be less changeable and perturbable, habituated
more quickly, and calmed themselves more readily when upset compared
to the Caucasian newborns. Although these findings are inconclusive, they suggest
that important psychobiological differences exist between Asians and Caucasians,
especially considering that these findings were evident at such an early age.


Unlike the lack of research on biological vulnerabilities, there are numerous
studies that link environmental stressors to increased risk for psychopathology
among Asian Americans. This is especially the case for the growing influx of
Asian immigrants and Southeast Asian refugees who encounter multiple environmental
stressors in the United States such as culture conflicts, language problems,
strained financial resources, prejudice and discrimination, and lack of familiar
and adequate social support. Furthermore, many of the Southeast Asian refugees
have been repeatedly traumatized prior to their entry into the United States, as
will be discussed later in the chapter.

[p. <i>461</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00472&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Past research illustrates that immigrant status increases the risk for adjustment
problems among Asian Americans. Ying (1988) found that foreign birth coupled
with a limited period of residence in the United States was associated with a
higher degree of depressive symptoms for Chinese Americans, although this relationship
was not significant when social class was controlled. Using the Omnibus
Personality Inventory, Sue and Zane (1985) likewise reported adjustment difficulties
for a sample of recently immigrated Chinese students who spent 6 years
or less in the United States. These researchers stated that the immigrant Chinese
students in their study were less autonomous and extroverted and more anxious
than Chinese students who had lived longer in the United States. Interestingly,
however, the academic achievement levels of the foreign-born students exceeded
those of the general student body. Therefore, Sue and Zane cautioned that academic
performance should not be used as an indicator of psychological well-being
or adjustment for newly arrived Chinese college students. In another study, Abe
and Zane (1990) found significant differences between Caucasian American and
foreign-born Asian American college students on a measure of psychological adjustment.
Results from this study demonstrated that foreign-born Asian Americans
reported greater levels of interpersonal distress than did their White counterparts,
even after controlling for demographic differences and the influences of social
desirability, self-consciousness, extraversion, and other-directedness (i.e., being
attuned to the desires and needs of others). These results are especially interesting
given that the foreign-born Asian American sample had resided in the United
States for an average of 10 years. Abe and Zane proposed that the various stressors
that many foreign-born Asian Americans face, such as language barriers and loss
of social support networks, might have long-term negative effects on psychological
adjustment.


Kuo and Tsai (1986) presented several interesting findings in their study of
Asian immigrants who resettled in Seattle, Washington. These researchers found
that the Koreans, the most recently arrived immigrants, exhibited twice the rate
of depression compared to the Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino groups under investigation.
For the overall sample, immigrants who possessed accurate information
about living in the United States prior to immigration reported fewer financial
worries and adjustment difficulties, such as problems with the English language,
homesickness, and lifestyle changes, than did those without such information.
Immigrants who moved at an earlier age also experienced fewer adjustment difficulties.
In regard to social support, immigrants who reported having numerous
friends who were available for frank discussions, or "available" relatives in one's
residential area, exhibited fewer depressive symptoms than did those who lacked
such an extensive social network. Finally, Kuo and Tsai found that immigrants
with "hardy" personalities reported less stressful life events, financial worries,
adjustment difficulties, and symptoms of depression than did those who lacked
hardy traits. Thus, hardy Asian immigrants, or those who felt a sense of control
over their life events, maintained a strong commitment to their life activities, and
perceived change as an exciting opportunity for personal development, were more
likely to display positive adjustment to their new American lifestyles.

[p. <i>462</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00473&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Studies also have consistently shown that Southeast Asian refugees constitute
a high-risk group for mental disorders. Adjustment difficulties in Southeast Asian
refugees have been linked to repeated exposure to catastrophic environmental
stressors such as torture, combat, witnessing the death of family members and
relatives, and forcible detainment in harsh refugee camp conditions. In one particular
study, Southeast Asian refugees who had experienced multiple premigration
traumas were significantly at risk for experiencing psychosocial dysfunction
or impaired daily functioning (Chun, 1991).


The extent of traumatization in the Southeast Asian refugee community has
been widely documented. Gong-Guy (1987), in a statewide mental health needs
assessment, reported that 55% of Southeast Asian refugees experienced separations
from or deaths of family members, with 30% experiencing multiple separations
or losses. For the Cambodian sample alone, nearly two thirds of the surveyed
adults endured the loss of family members. Cambodian women were particularly
traumatized; more than one in five experienced the death of a husband. Many
of these women described incidences of unspeakable trauma in which they witnessed
their husbands and children being shot, tortured, or starved to death or
instances in which they were wounded or victimized themselves. Mollica, Wyshak,
and Lavelle (1987) also reported episodes of repeated traumatization in their Southeast
Asian refugee patient sample. These researchers found that the Southeast
Asians in their study had experienced an average of 10 traumatic episodes that
were characterized by various atrocities such as deprivation of food and water,
torture, physical injury from war, sexual abuse, and solitary confinement.


Elevated rates of mental disorders have coincided with multiple traumatic
episodes for Southeast Asian refugees. Kinzie and colleagues (1990) reported
that 70% of their overall Southeast Asian refugee patient sample met DSM-III-R
criteria for a current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 5%
met criteria for a past diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). Furthermore,
82% suffered from depression, themostcommon non-PTSD diagnosis,
and approximately 16% had schizophrenia. The elevated incidence of PTSD among
these highly traumatized Southeast Asian refugees was even more alarming when
group differences were analyzed. In this case, PTSD was diagnosed in 95% of
the Mien sample (a highland tribe from Laos) and in 92% of the Cambodian
sample. The clinical significance of these findings is underscored by the fact that
most of these PTSD sufferers had experienced their traumatic events 10 to 15
years prior to assessment. Such prolonged effects of trauma on psychological
functioning also were evidenced in a follow-up study of Cambodian adolescents
who had survived Pol Pot's concentration camps (Kinzie, Sack, Angell, Clarke,
&amp; Ben, 1989). In this study, 48% of the adolescents suffered from PTSD and
41% experienced depression approximately 10 years after their traumatization.


Similar results were found by Mollica, Wyshak, and Lavelle (1987). About
50% of their Southeast Asian refugee patients fulfilled <i>DSM-III</i> criteria for PTSD,
and 71% suffered from major affective disorder. Certain groups had even higher
prevalence rates. The Hmong/Laotian group exhibited the highest rates at 92%

[p. <i>463</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00474&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a point prevalence study of adult Hmong refugees, a rural and agrarian
people from Laos, Westermeyer (1988) found that 43% met <i>DSM-III</i> criteria for
various Axis I diagnoses such as adjustment disorder, major depression, and paranoia.
Westermeyer emphasized that despite the relatively small sample (<i>N</i> = 97)
that was investigated, the high rate of Axis I diagnoses exhibited by these refugees-
—twice the expected rate for the general U.S. population—underscored the
degree of psychopathology that is likely to occur in Southeast Asian refugee groups.


In addition to premigration trauma, certain postmigration status variables
also have been associated with increased susceptibility for adjustment difficulties
among Southeast Asian refugees. Older age has been associated with more symptoms
of depression for Hmong refugees (Westermeyer, Neider, &amp; Callies, 1989),
and being a divorced or widowed female head of household has been linked to
increased susceptibility for psychological and physical complaints (Lin, Tazuma,
&amp; Masuda, 1979). Other postmigration variables that might predispose Southeast
Asians to adjustment difficulties include limited English proficiency (Nicassio,
Solomon, Guest, &amp; McCullough, 1986), a 10- to 12-month length of stay in the
host country (Beiser, 1988), and low income and less education (Nicassio &amp; Pate,
1984). In support of these findings, Tran (1989) found that low income, a poor
educational background, and limited English-speaking skills were negatively
associated with psychological well-being in Vietnamese refugees. Finally, researchers
also have discovered a significant relationship between yearnings to
return to one's native land and mental health problems. In a study by Westermeyer
et al. (1989), Hmong refugees who maintained the wish to return to Asia had a
higher probability of exhibiting psychopathology. However, Abe, Zane, and Chun
(1994) found that preservation of cultural identity and affiliation with one's ethnic
community in the United States acted as protective factors against posttraumatic
stress for Southeast Asian refugees. These researchers also found that
trauma-related anger played a significant role in adjustment; refugees without
PTSD expressed less anger than did their counterparts who suffered from this
disorder.


Asian American Vietnam war veterans represent another high-risk group due
to their exposure to adverse environmental stressors that compounded the trauma
of combat. Many of these veterans encountered racism by fellow U.S. soldiers,
faced combat experiences that challenged traditional cultural norms, and identified
with a wartime enemy who, in many respects, could be regarded as a fellow
Asian (Chun &amp; Abueg, 1989). A Japanese American marine corporal described
his experience in a military training class:
<blockquote>
<p>
I was used as an example of a gook. You go to class and they say you'll be fighting
the VC [Viet Cong] or the NVA [North Vietnamese Army]. But then the person
who was giving the class will see me and he'll say, "He looks just like that, right
there." (quoted in Hamada, Chembtob, Sautner, &amp; Sato, 1988)
</p>
</blockquote>

In respect to the preceding findings, there currently is no conclusive evidence
that Asian Americans are more biologically vulnerable to certain mental disorders
than are other ethnic groups. However, this does not imply that significant psychobiological
differences between Asians and Caucasians do not exist. Research provides
strong evidence that Asians and Caucasians differ significantly in their psychobiological
reactions to both alcohol and psychotropic medications. Studies of newborn
infants also suggest that important psychobiological differences exist between
Asians and Caucasians, as evidenced in early developmental differences in temperament
and excitability/imperturbability. The role of biology in the development of
mental illness among Asian Americans requires further exploration nonetheless.


Studies have uncovered numerous environmental stressors that place Asian
immigrants and refugees at increased risk for psychopathology. Such stressors
include culture conflicts, language difficulties, lack of social supports, and financial
strain that might contribute to the elevated rates of depression and anxiety
disorders that have been reported in these communities. Still, Kuo and Tsai (1986)
found that Asian immigrants with hardy personality traits are less susceptible to
adjustment difficulties than are those without such traits. Settling in the United
States poses yet additional environmental stressors to Southeast Asian refugees,
many of whom already have faced the trauma of war and political upheaval in their
native lands. This traumatized group exhibits elevated rates of PTSD and depression
that are even more alarming when group differences and sociodemographics are
analyzed. In this case, women in highly traumatized groups, such as the Cambodians
and Hmong, are especially vulnerable to psychopathology. Lastly, research
also suggests that Asian American Vietnam veterans are at increased risk for mental
illness due to their repeated exposure to combat trauma and racial victimization.
Because this special group of veterans tends to avoid mental health services
for both cultural and sociopolitical reasons, many continue to suffer in silence
and have truly become the forgotten warriors of a devastating war.


<b>EXPERIENCE</b>


Does culture affect how Asian Americans experience stressors and psychopathology?
Marsella (1988) offered a definition of culture that provides some insight
to this question. Marsella defined <i>culture</i> as

[p. <i>465</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00476&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

shared learned behavior which is transmitted from one generation to another
for purposes of individual and societal growth, adjustment, and adaptation;
culture is represented externally as artifacts, roles, and institutions, and it is
represented internally as values, beliefs, attitudes, epistemology, consciousness,
and biological functioning, (pp. 8-9)


The influence of culture on traditional Asian health beliefs is most evident
in the Chinese term for psychology itself, which is composed of two characters
depicting "heart" and "logic" or "thought." In this sense, the Chinese culture
ascribes to the notion that thought is intimately tied to the heart, which is the
seat of emotional and physical health. Ying (1990) found support for this cultural
construct among immigrant Chinese women who framed the experience of mental
illness within this dynamic soma and psyche concept. When asked to conceptualize
the problems of a depressed Asian woman in a fictitious scenario, Ying's
participants responded by describing the causes and consequences of depression
both in psychological (e.g., low/unstable mood) and physiological (e.g., heart
problems) terms.


Research also suggests that the Asian American experience of mental illness
might reflect Western beliefs of stress and adjustment as well. Loo, Tong, and
True (1989) found that mental health beliefs among Chinese residents of San
Francisco's Chinatown were more Westernized than expected. In this case, 30%
of Loo et al.'s community sample believed that mental disorders were caused by
pressures and problems (e.g., overstressed, overworked, pressure at work),
whereas 20% attributed them to personality (e.g., too sensitive), 8% to neglect
(e.g., lack of love), and 5% to a combination of these causes. Interestingly, only
7% held the more traditional Asian belief that mental disorders were caused by
genetic or organic factors. Loo et al. suggested that the participants in their study
endorsed more Western-oriented health beliefs because they were more acculturated
compared to the samples in previous studies. This is substantiated by the
fact that 40% of Loo et al.'s sample had lived in the United States for more than
10 years and 30% had lived in this country for more than 20 years. By contrast,
Ying's (1990) participants had resided in the United States for an average of only
2.7 years.


The coping strategies of Asian Americans also might differ from those of
other ethnic groups due in part to cultural differences in the conceptualization
of mental and physical illness. For instance, the immigrant Chinese women in
Ying's (1990) study were more likely to seek professional help (e.g., psychologist,
medical doctor, government support) if they conceptualized depressive symptoms
in predominantly physiological terms. Conversely, those who emphasized the
psychological aspects of depression were more inclined to seek nonprofessional
help (e.g., advice from family, husband, friend, or elderly) or rely on their own

[p. <i>466</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00477&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Loo et al. (1989) found that Chinatown residents reported varied and complex
means of dealing with problems, which argues against cultural homogeneity
in the way in which Asian Americans cope. Coping strategies for participants in
this particular study ranged from acceptance of fate (e.g., "Fate can't be changed.
Whatever happens to me, I would take as a way it's supposed to be") to determination
(e.g., "Try to be logical"). However, one-fourth of the participants reported
using multiple means of coping that were sequential or dependent on the
nature of the problem or consequences of the initially attempted solution. For
instance, one participant stated, "I try my best to face and solve [my problems],
and I get advice from friends. If it's too hard to solve, I try to forget it."


Cultural representations of the self also may affect how Asian Americans
experience mental illness or adjustment problems. Markus and Kitayama (1991)
posited that representations of the self and others can influence and even determine
the nature of one's experience. Furthermore, they asserted that "selfconstruals"
can be broadly conceptualized in terms of independence versus
interdependence depending on the normative tasks of one's culture. One may
hypothesize that Asian cultures tend to place a high value on group harmony,
thereby reinforcing self-construals of interdependence. This is reflected in the
Japanese word for self, <i>jibun</i>, which refers to "one's share of the shared life space"
(Hamaguchi, 1985). Such representations of the self, which foster group cohesion,
might conceivably affect the experience of mental illness for Asian Americans.
For instance, Asian Americans might be particularly concerned with conflicts
of interdependence such as interpersonal tension, social isolation, and group disharmony.
This was evidenced in Ying's ( 1990) sample of immigrant Chinese women,
who consistently conceptualized depression as a catalyst to interpersonal conflict.
This finding was especially interesting considering that these women projected
this concern onto a fictitious scenario in which interpersonal relationships were
not even mentioned. Ying hypothesized that this projection reflected the importance
of interpersonal harmony both as a precursor to and as a consequence of
positive mental health in the Chinese culture.


Research also suggests that Asians with interdependent representations of
the self might attribute interpersonal problems to situational rather than dispositional
causes. Okazaki and Zane (1990) found that Asian Americans rated interpersonal
problems of overinvolvement (e.g., "I feel too responsible for solving
others' problems") and negative assertion (e.g., "I have difficulty letting other
people know what I want") as less personally involving (i.e., less personal investment

[p. <i>467</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00478&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally, culture may influence how Asians describe and express their emotional
and psychological states. Russell (1991) illustrated that emotional and psychological
terminology found in Asian cultures often lacks semantic equivalents
in Western psychiatric nomenclature. For example, Russell mentioned that the
Chinese culture does not possess an exact translation for Western notions of depression,
guilt, and anxiety. Furthermore, Cheng (1977) noted that two Chinese
words that are similar to "anxiety" are better translated as "tension" and "worry."
Tseng and Hsu (1969) stated that "depressed mood," as construed in the West,
does not have a cultural equivalent in colloquial Mandarin spoken in Taiwan.


Russell (1991) further mentioned that preliterate societies that speak languages
that are least similar to English show the greatest cultural variability in
the categorization of emotional states. This has important implications for understanding
and treating psychopathology among Southeast Asian refugees such
as the Hmong, whose culture is without an indigenous written language. Thus,
psychiatric concepts that are rooted in the Western culture, such as depression
and anxiety, might fail to capture the psychosocial experience of these preliterate
Southeast Asian peoples.


The preceding studies demonstrate that culture may influence numerous aspects
of the Asian American experience of mental illness. For the Chinese, the
traditional belief in the intertwining soma and psyche relationship may lead to
both psychological and physiological conceptualizations of mental illness. Furthermore,
such conceptualizations may determine the coping strategies among
Asians. Research suggests that those who conceptualize psychopathology in terms
of both psychological and physiological causes are the best candidates for seeking
professional help. Also, interdependence conflicts such as interpersonal tension,
social isolation, and group disharmony might be particularly salient for many
Asians who maintain culturally proscribed interdependent representations of the
self. Research also suggests that Asians with interdependent self-representations
might attribute interpersonal problems according to situational rather than dispositional
factors. Still, studies demonstrate that the Asian experience of psychopathology
is heterogeneous. Experience appears to vary with acculturation such
that mental health beliefs among recently arrived Asians might be more embedded
in their native culture compared to those who have resided in the United States
for a longer duration. Finally, psychologists and other mental health professionals
must be mindful of the fact that psychiatric nomenclature that frequently is used
in the West might fail to capture the psychosocial experience for certain segments
of the Asian American population, especially for those who come from preliterate
societies such as the Hmong refugees.

<b>MANIFESTATION</b>


Do Asian Americans exhibit unique patterns of symptom expression? Research
provides strong evidence that Asians do exhibit culturally distinct symptom patterns.
This is most evident in various culture-specific syndromes such as <i>koro</i> and
<i>hwabyung. Koro</i>, which has been evidenced primarily in the Southeast Asian and
Chinese cultures, usually is associated with anxiety symptoms stemming from
the fear of genital retraction and often is accompanied by the belief that complete
retraction of the genitals into the abdomen will lead to death (Bernstein &amp; Gaw,
1990; Westermeyer, 1989). According to Pang (1990), <i>hwabyung</i>, or "fire-illness"—
<i>hwa</i> meaning both "fire" and "anger" and <i>byung</i> meaning "illness"—is predominantly
found in the Korean culture. Furthermore, Koreans ascribe this disorder
to multiple causes such as lasting anger, disappointments, sadness, miseries, hostility,
grudges, and unfulfilled dreams and expectations. <i>Hwabyung</i> is manifested
in a broad range of physical symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to poor
eyesight.


These culture-specific syndromes, which may be regarded as indigenous expressions
of distress, are intimately connected to the Asian experience of stress
and mental illness, as mentioned previously. For instance, the traditional mindbody
concept is evidenced in both koros and <i>hwabyung</i> such that stress or psychological
distress is likewise accompanied by disturbances in somatic functioning.
Further evidence for culturally influenced symptom patterns among Asians also
can be seen for Western psychiatric syndromes such as depression.


In a study of Asian and Caucasian American college students, ethnic differences
were found for items that discriminated between depressed and nondepressed
respondents using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (Marsella,
Kinzie, &amp; Gordon, 1973). Gastrointestinal symptoms such as poor appetite, indigestion,
and suffering from gas and belches differentiated depressives from nondepressives
for the Chinese and Japanese but not for the Caucasians. However,
"the urge to eat when not hungry" discriminated depressives from nondepressives
only for the Caucasians. In another study examining depressive symptomatology
among college students, Chang (1985) reported that overseas Chinese were more
likely to indicate trouble with constipation and feeling restless than were Black
and Caucasian Americans.


Depressive symptom patterns also have been investigated in other Asian clinical
populations. Cheung, Lau, and Waldmann (1981) studied depressive symptoms
among Hong Kong Chinese medical outpatients who initially sought services
at a private clinic for general medical complaints. Upon intake, these patients
were diagnosed as depressed or nondepressed using a translated Chinese language
version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The most common
presenting problems of the depressed group were sleep disturbance, tiredness,
headache, menopausal symptoms for the women, loss of appetite, abdominal
pain, palpitation, bodily weakness, fearfulness, and epigastric pain. More strikingly,
however, none of the depressed patients came to the clinic with initial complaints
of sadness, unhappiness, or depressed mood. Still, Cheung and colleagues

[p. <i>469</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00480&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Kinzie et al. (1982) developed and validated the 15-item Vietnamese language
Depression Rating Scale, which provided information on both the universal
and culture-variant aspects of depressive symptomatology. Results showed that Vietnamese
normals and psychiatric outpatients reported symptoms common to
Western psychiatric conceptualizations of depression such as poor appetite, various
aches and pains, hopelessness, poor concentration, and exhaustion. Mood
items such as "low-spirited" and "sad and bothered" also were readily endorsed.
However, within-culture symptom patterns were noticed as well. The Vietnamese
respondents reported a pervasive sense of suffering and anxiety surrounding their
somatic symptoms. In addition, depression often was accompanied by feelings
of shame and dishonor, a strong sense of desperation, fear of "going crazy," and
feelings of demoralization associated with the inability to fulfill familial or ancestral
obligations.


Unlike the preceding studies, a multination, multicenter, psychiatric epidemiological
study conducted by the World Health Organization did not report significant
differences in depressive symptoms between Asians and other ethnic groups
(Sartorius, Jablensky, Gulbinat, &amp; Ernberg, 1980). One of the centers that participated
in this study included 222 Japanese psychiatric outpatients in Nagasaki
and Tokyo, Japan. Data from the Schedule for Standardized Assessment of Depressive
Disorders (SADD) indicated that patients from each of the study sites
(including India, Switzerland, Iran, and Canada) exhibited similar depressive
symptoms such as sadness, joylessness, anxiety, tension, lack of energy, loss of
interest, loss of ability to concentrate, and ideas of insufficiency, inadequacy, or
worthlessness. Although there was a lack of symptomatic variation across the
centers, the investigators acknowledged that the SADD might not have adequately
measured culture-specific depressive patterns.


Factor analytic studies have been another method of examining symptom
patterns in Asians. Principal component factor analysis combined with varimax
rotation was applied to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale
(CES-D) in Kuo's (1984) study of Asians in Seattle, Ying's (1988) study of Chinese
in San Francisco, and Lin's (1989) study of residents in Tienjin, China. Although
the reported CES-D factor structures and item indicators for these studies were
quite similar to those found in Radloff's (1977) original CES-D study, there also
were several important differences. Radloff originally obtained four interpretable
factors for the CES-D using predominantly Caucasian communities in the United
States. These factors were (1) depressed affect, (2) positive affect, (3) somatic
and retarded activity, and (4) interpersonal problems (e.g., unfriendly, disliked,
talk less, lonely). However, in Kuo's (1984) study, the four factors that accounted

[p. <i>470</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00481&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The discrepancies in these factor analytic findings were unexpected because
it was assumed that the Seattle and San Francisco Chinese, whom presumably
were more Americanized than the mainland Chinese, would respond more similarly
to Radloff's (1977) sample than would their overseas counterparts. This
might be explained by differences in the translation of the CES-D or other methodological
procedures. Furthermore, these unexpected findings might be attributed
to the fact that acculturation involves other variables such as cultural attitudes,
lifestyle practices, and English language proficiency in addition to place of birth
or residency. Nevertheless, the CES-D factor analytic results for the two Asian
American samples were consistent; depressed affect and somatic complaints
emerged as one factor.


Factor analytic studies also have been performed for Zung's SDS. Chang
(1985) reported that a mixture of affective and somatic complaints accounted
for most of the variance in a Black college student sample, whereas existential
(e.g., "loss of interest in life," "feeling that the future is hopeless") and cognitive
(e.g., "mind is not alert," "thoughts are confused") concerns contributed to the
most variance for Caucasian students. However, the factor that contributed to
the most variance for overseas Chinese students was characterized by somatic
complaints. Chang noted, however, that the Chinese did not have quantitatively
less affective complaints; rather, the affective components were not "grouped"
with the somatic symptoms.


These findings were similar to those of Marsella et al.'s (1973) earlier factor
analysis of the SDS. In Marsella and colleagues' study, the Japanese, Chinese,
and Caucasians all evidenced similar patterns of existential complaints. However,
cognitive complaints were somewhat independent for the Japanese and Chinese,
whereas cognitive complaints usually were associated with other areas of functioning
(e.g., existential complaints) for the Caucasians. For the Chinese, there
also appeared to be a clear pattern of depression associated with somatic complaints,
whereas the other groups manifested somatic symptoms with other disturbances.
Finally, interpersonal complaints proved to be the best indicator of
depression mainly for the Japanese.

[p. <i>471</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00482&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Factor analytic studies of the CES-D and Zung's SDS demonstrate the centrality
of somatic concerns among Asians. The differences in sample populations
(e.g., students, community samples, treated cases), instrumentation, and methodology
among these studies only serve to strengthen the argument that Asians
and Asian Americans manifest depression in ways that are different from other
comparison groups.


Cultural differences in symptom expression have been the focus of studies
on somatization among Asians. <i>Somatization</i> refers to an expression of distress
that is manifested as general or vague physical complaints. This might involve
general aches and pains in the extremities or head, weakness throughout the
body, nausea or upset stomach, or numbness and tingling. Westermeyer, Bouafuely,
Neider, and Callies (1989) found several correlates to somatization among
Hmong refugees. These included older age, a limited formal education, unemployment,
and English nonfluency.


Several theories have been offered to explain the high incidence of somatization
among Asians. As suggested previously, traditional health beliefs may lead
to the expression of somatic symptoms. Thus, a problem, be it physiological,
social, or affective in origin, may be expressed in both physical and psychological
domains as specified by the soma and psyche conceptualization of health. It also
has been suggested that the shame and stigma that are attached to psychological
distress in the Asian culture might inhibit Asians from reporting mental health
problems (Sue &amp; Sue, 1987; Tsai,Teng, &amp; Sue, 1980). Mechanic (1980) proposed
that reporting physical symptoms might be more "culturally neutral," whereas
reporting psychological symptoms is more dependent on social acceptability. Thus,
somatization allows Asians to "save face" in the event of psychological distress.
Lin (1989) argued that the high rate of somatic complaints among the Chinese
reflects cultural rather than cognitive preferences, and given appropriate structured
inquiry, the Chinese can express cognitive symptoms. For instance, Lin
explained that the open-ended probing of most diagnostic or descriptive instruments
might elicit a high number of somatic complaints among the Chinese. Nevertheless,
Beiser &amp; Fleming (1986) found no relationship between reports of
depressive symptoms and somatization among Southeast Asian refugees. This
latter finding disputes the notion that somatization is a substitute for psychosocial
distress. Thus, Asians possess the capacity to express themselves in psychological
terms, although somatic complaints might predominate their symptom presentation.
This was clearly evidenced in Cheung's (1982) sample of Hong Kong
Chinese who endorsed psychological symptoms equally as, if not more so than,
physiologically based symptoms. According to Rumbaut (1985), researchers often
assume that somatization among Asians stems from their tendency to deny or
suppress emotions, which only serves to perpetuate cultural stereotypes of Asians.
Rumbaut stated,
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead of illuminating our understanding of affective processes, the "somatization"
concept seems to us to function more as a superficial and prejudicial mode
</p><p>[p. <i>472</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00483&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
of dismissing complex psychocultural realities and of discrediting the experience
of human suffering of different social classes. While the expression of emotional
pain may be socially stigmatized or culturally proscribed in particular situations,
the emotional experience of human suffering—certainly as reflected in the
[Southeast Asian] refugee experience we have studied—emerges as transcultural
and universal, (p. 476)
</blockquote>

In sum, the research illustrates that Asians and Asian Americans may exhibit
different symptom patterns than do other ethnic groups. This is most evident in
studies of various culture-specific syndromes such as koros (as documented in
the Chinese and Southeast Asian cultures) and hwabyung (as documented in the
Korean culture). Studies of symptom expression for Western constructs of mental
health also reveal significant cultural differences. This is especially the case for
depression; bodily symptoms that include gastrointestinal problems, headaches,
palpitations, and physical weakness may predominate the symptom presentation
of depressed Asians. Still, Asians experience emotional distress and have the capacity
to express psychological difficulties, although such somatic complaints
might be more readily apparent. There are cultural factors that may, nonetheless,
contribute to somatization such as cultural stigma and traditional health beliefs.
Finally, Rumbaut (1985) contended that the concept of somatization should be
reconsidered because it perpetuates Asian stereotypes and often dismisses the
notion that emotional suffering transverses cultural boundaries.


<b>PREVALENCE</b>


How are rates of mental disorders determined, and are assessment and diagnostic
procedures valid for Asian Americans? Currently, the prevalence of psychopathology
in the Asian American population is unknown because of the lack of
large-scale studies. Although estimates from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
Study indicated that nearly 20% of the American population either had experienced
a mental disorder within the past 6 months or currently were experiencing
one, prevalence rates for the Asian American community were not established
because of inadequate sampling (Meyers et al., 1984). Researchers have, nonetheless,
estimated the rates of mental illness among Asian Americans using treated
and untreated case methods. Furthermore, culturally sensitive assessment and
diagnostic instruments have been developed that have made important contributions
to prevalence studies, as will be discussed later in this section. First, estimated
rates of mental illness among Asians, as determined by treated and untreated
cases, are examined.


<b><i>Treated Cases</i></b>


Researchers have estimated prevalence by examining the number of Asian
Americans who have sought services for their mental health needs. Although this

[p. <i>473</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00484&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Findings from early treated case studies suggested that proportionally far
fewer Asian Americans were suffering from mental illnesses compared to other
ethnic groups. For instance, Kitano (1969) found that Japanese and Chinese Americans
were admitted to California state hospitals from 1960 to 1965 less often
than were Caucasian Americans relative to their proportions in the state population.
Based on admission rates per 100,000, Japanese rates ranged from 40 to
60, whereas Chinese rates ranged from 70 to 90 each year during the 1960-1965
period. Meanwhile, the Caucasian rates during this period ranged from 150 to
180 per 100,000. Similarly, results from a study conducted by the state of Hawaii
(1970) showed that the Chinese, Hawaiians, Japanese, and Filipinos displayed
lower hospital admission rates for mental disturbances than did Caucasians during
the 1969-1970 period. In that study, Caucasians comprised 48.5% of first admissions
to state hospitals, although they accounted for only 39.2% of the population
in Hawaii. This was compared to the Japanese (15% of first admissions,
28.3% of the population), Filipinos (8% of first admissions, 12.4% of the population),
Hawaiians (0.6% of first admissions, 9.3% of the population), and Chinese
(1.5% of first admissions, 6.8% of the population).


Sue and Sue (1974) also reported low utilization rates of mental health services
among Asian American college students. For example, Sue and Sue found
that only 4% of all students who used a campus psychiatric clinic were Chinese
or Japanese American, yet both ethnic groups together comprised approximately
8% of the total student population. Such low utilization rates suggested that the
Asian American students were relatively well adjusted compared to their non-Asian
counterparts. However, Sue and Sue found that those Asian American students
who were treated by the university clinic had higher Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory scale scores and more psychotic profiles than did non-Asian
American clients. They consequently argued that the most severely disturbed Asian
American clients were more likely to use mental health services than were those
with milder problems.


Sue and McKinney (1975) found similar results in a 3-year comprehensive
study of Asian American patients who were treated at 17 community mental
health centers in the Seattle area. These researchers discovered that only 0.7%
of the patients were Asian Americans, although this ethnic group represented
approximately 2.4% of the population served by these centers. Congruent with
Sue and Sue's (1974) findings, Sue and McKinney (1975) reported that those
Asian Americans who sought services were more severely disturbed. Thus, those
who used services received a higher proportion of psychotic diagnoses than did
Caucasian American patients, even when demographic differences such as age
and educational level were controlled.


The preceding research studies illustrate that Asian Americans are more severely
impaired despite their underutilization of mental health services. This supports
the assertion by Sue and colleagues (Sue &amp; Morishima, 1982; Sue &amp; Sue,

[p. <i>474</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00485&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Untreated Cases</i></b>


Prevalence rates of psychopathology also can be estimated by examining untreated
community samples rather than treated client populations. Researchers
following this method assess psychopathology by using self-report measures, interviews,
or rating instruments, often through face-to-face or telephone contact
with community residents. A few untreated case studies have suggested that the
rates of psychopathology in the Asian American community might be as high as,
or even higher than, those in other ethnic communities.


From their interviews of adult residents in a large Chinatown community,
Loo et al. (1989) found that more than one-third of their sample admitted to
symptoms of emotional tension. Feelings of depression also were common among
the residents, with 4 out of 10 complaining of a "sinking feeling like being depressed."
In addition, a quarter of the residents admitted to having "periods of
days, weeks, or months when [they] couldn't take care of things because [they]
couldn't get going." In regard to feelings of loneliness, more than half of the
respondents wished that there was someone they could really talk to. Furthermore,
loneliness was surprisingly more prevalent among younger adults than
among the elderly. Finally, Loo and colleagues reported that 35% of the respondents
endorsed four or more items on the Langner Scale, whereas 20% acknowledged
seven or more items. Such endorsement rates on the Langner Scale
traditionally have been considered to be indications of psychiatric impairment.
The two most frequently endorsed Langner Scale items included "a memory that's
not all right" (40%) and "worrying a lot" (42%). Loo and colleagues concluded
that the former result might have been related to the predominant elderly representation
in the Chinatown community and the latter to the combination of
disadvantaged status and age. Although this sample was not representative of the

[p. <i>475</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00486&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several studies have examined the rates of depression among Asian Americans
using the CES-D. Surveying Asian Americans living in Seattle, Kuo (1984) found
that Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Korean American immigrants reported slightly
more depressive symptoms, on average, than did Caucasian respondents in other
studies. Also using the CES-D, Hurh and Kim (1990) similarly found that Korean
immigrants residing in Chicago had higher scores for depression than did Caucasians.
High rates of depression were once again revealed in a telephone survey
of Chinese Americans in San Francisco. Using the CES-D, Ying (1988) conducted
a telephone survey among Chinese Americans in the San Francisco area and found
them to be significantly more depressed than the Chinese Americans in Kuo's
study. Still, it is difficult to compare the CES-D findings among these studies
given their differences in methodological and sampling procedures.


In a review of the literature on the mental health of various ethnic minority
groups, Vega and Rumbaut (1991) remarked that knowledge of Asian Americans
is much less developed than for African Americans and Latinos and that no national-level
epidemiological surveys have been conducted with this ethnic population.
Nevertheless, tentative conclusions can be derived from the treated and
untreated case studies presented here. First, there is no indication that Asian Americans
have lower rates of mental disturbance than those of Caucasians, especially
when rates of depression are considered. Second, there are important within-group
differences (e.g., between Koreans and Chinese) in the prevalence of disorders
among Asian Americans.


The validity of diagnostic and assessment procedures is a central issue in
studying the rate and distribution of mental disorders among Asian Americans.
If case-finding strategies or assessment procedures are inappropriate or culturally
biased, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to accurately estimate the prevalence
of disorders. Although reasonable efforts have been made by investigators to
consider the issue of cultural bias in assessment, it is difficult to determine the
actual extent to which cultural factors affect assessment findings.


Past case illustrations indicate that Asian American clients might be overdiagnosed
(i.e., inappropriately defined as psychiatric cases) when cultural influences
on symptom presentation are overlooked. Westermeyer (1987) illustrated
a case of overdiagnosis of a 48-year-old Chinese woman who was given antipsychotic
and antidepressant medication for psychotic depression. According to
Westermeyer, a decisive factor in her diagnosis lay in her belief that her deceased
mother, whom she had seen in her dreams, had returned to bring her into the
next world. Later, it was recognized that this symptom was not indicative of a
delusional disorder but instead was congruent with her cultural beliefs. The patient's
condition improved once her antipsychotic medication was discontinued
and the dosage of her antidepressants was reduced.


By contrast, behaviors that appear to be normative to the Asian culture might,
in fact, indicate mental illness on closer inspection. For example, Westermeyer
(1987) presented a clinical case involving a 26-year-old Vietnamese refugee who

[p. <i>476</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00487&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Language barriers pose additional challenges in the assessment of Asian Americans.
As mentioned previously, researchers have argued that many non-Western
languages do not possess cultural equivalents for numerous Western psychological
constructs. Interpreters often cannot overcome such language barriers and, even
worse, might further compound the difficulties in assessing Asian American clients.
As Sue and Sue (1987) mentioned, the inclusion of interpreters expands the
therapeutic process to a triadic situation, thus increasing the risk for miscommunication
and inaccurate diagnoses. Marcos (1979) also found that the attitudes and
personal beliefs of the interpreters might distort their translations. In this case,
an interpreter might minimize pathology or avoid culturally sensitive issues such
as sexual relations and death, especially if the interpreter is related to the client.


Given these difficulties in the assessment and diagnosis of Asian Americans,
what can be done to improve measurement strategies? Sue and Sue (1987) provided
a conceptual overview of measurement strategies that have been used with
ethnic minority groups. The first strategy, point research, entails the application
of measures of one culture with members in a different culture. In this case, scores
on the measures are compared between cultures and are interpreted according
to the norms of the culture from which the instrument was developed. For example,
the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, which was developed in the West, was
translated for use with Southeast Asian refugees (Mollica, Wyshak, de Marneffe,
Khuon, and Lavelle (1987). Clearly, there are potential problems in using this
point research approach. One must be cautious in using emic (or culturally specific)
assessment instruments in an etic (or cross-cultural) manner. By using a
culturally specific assessment tool in another culture, one is assuming that all
cultures share the same construct that is to be measured. The inherent difficulties
of point research are illustrated in a study by Takeuchi, Kuo, Kim, and Leaf (1989),
who found that 54 scale items on the Symptom Checklist (SCL) did not correspond
to the SCL's five hypothesized factors (anxiety, depression, interpersonal
sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive, and somatization) among four ethnic groups
that resided in Hawaii. Among the different groups, Caucasians appeared to have
the best fit between empirical and hypothesized factors on the SCL, followed by
the Japanese, Filipinos, and Native Hawaiians. Kinzie and his colleagues (1982)
similarly showed that the Beck Depression Inventory exhibited low reliability
and validity among the Vietnamese. These studies illustrate that the validity and
reliability of point research findings often are open to question.


The second assessment strategy, linear research, involves a series of studies
that are used to systematically test hypotheses related to the construct under investigation.

[p. <i>477</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00488&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally, in a parallel assessment approach, a combined etic-emic strategy is
followed such that an etic construct is identified and then an emic measure is
developed to test the validity and reliability of the construct in each culture. Crosscultural
comparisons are made based on the emically defined construct. This
approach offers a comparative evaluation of a construct across cultures without
restriction from any single cultural frame of reference. An illustration of the parallel
approach is found in a study by Kinzie (1982) describing the development
of the Vietnamese Depression Inventory. In short, Kinzie and colleagues (1982)
collaborated with four bilingual Vietnamese mental health workers to develop a
measure of depression for Vietnamese patients using Vietnamese words that described
feelings or behaviors associated with depression. After a series of validity
and reliability procedures were conducted, it was found that differences between
Vietnamese and Western reports of depression were attributed to culturally distinct
constructs. Adoption of research strategies with parallel approaches is difficult
to conduct, but these strategies are ultimately the most valuable because
they enable us to accurately assess psychopathology for different cultural groups.


The preceding studies show that our knowledge of the nature and extent of
psychopathology among the Asian American population is growing but still quite
limited. Nevertheless, data from treated and untreated case methods indicate
that Asian Americans do not have lower rates of mental disturbance than Caucasians.
Furthermore, there are significant within-group differences in prevalence
rates among Asian Americans. Many of our current diagnostic and assessment
procedures that are used in prevalence studies have been validated using Caucasian
populations, which might contribute to cultural bias toward Asian Americans.
Culture-specific instruments, as applied in parallel research, might help resolve
this dilemma by using the native language and emic constructs of a particular
culture to assess its psychocultural experience.


<b>CONCLUDING COMMENTS</b>


The proposed Vulnerability-Experience-Manifestation-Prevalence model highlights
the role of culture and minority group status in these primary components
of psychopathology. However, there are numerous questions that are left unanswered.

[p. <i>478</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00489&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In regard to Experience, future research could investigate how the organization
and perception of adjustment problems affects the outcome of psychotherapy
for Asian clients. For example, one can hypothesize that outcome is more
favorable for Asian clients if they hold similar notions of the causes and nature
of adjustment problems as their therapists. Moreover, such incidences of "cognitive
match" might be more likely if both the therapist and client share the same
ethnic background or cultural beliefs. These issues currently are being investigated
in a study conducted by the National Research Center on Asian American Mental
Health.


Questions also remain regarding the Manifestation of psychopathology among
Asian Americans. The cultural mechanisms in symptom expression could be further
explored. For instance, studies could resolve the conflicting findings on the relationship
between acculturation and somatization. This could be achieved by
first developing a comprehensive index of acculturation that evaluates acculturation
on a global level to include demographic background, cultural attitudes, and
traditional practices. Such a global measure of acculturation could then be used
to identify those who are more likely to somaticize their distress. Past research
on symptom expression and help-seeking behavior suggests that this has important
implications for developing treatment services that are responsive to Asian
clients who may be more inclined to first seek medical help for underlying psychopathological
conditions.


Finally, large-scale studies that use culturally sensitive measures are needed
to determine the Prevalence of mental disorders among Asian Americans. Toward
this end, current measures used in the study of psychopathology need to be assessed
for their validity in various ethnic groups. Multimethod approaches need
to be used, and where constructs are found to be invalid, emic measures might
need to be developed in accordance with the parallel assessment approach. One
recent development might have major implications for understanding the prevalence
of psychopathology in the Asian American population. The National Research
Center on Asian American Mental Health has been awarded a National
Institute of Mental Health research grant to conduct a 5-year, large-scale study
of the prevalence of mental disorders among Chinese Americans. The intention
of this study is to ascertain the rate and distribution of mental disorders and
identify correlates (e.g., immigrant status, stressors, resources) to mental health.
It is hoped that insights into processes that affect mental health will be gained,
not only for Chinese Americans but also for Asian Americans in general.

<b><i>Recommendations</i></b>


Several conceptual and methodological recommendations might advance these
future studies of psychopathology among Asian Americans. First, on a conceptual
level, existing models of psychopathology should be evaluated to determine whether
they are valid for Asian Americans. For example, research indicates that the stresscoping
model of mental illness may be applied to Asian American populations
such as Southeast Asian refugees whose adjustment has been linked to both coping
resources, such as social and financial supports, and exposure to environmental
stressors. Second, if such models prove to be valid, then their individual elements
should be analyzed to determine whether they are fundamentally different for
Asian Americans. Using the stress-coping model as an example once again, one
might argue that there are important cultural differences within this model, although
its overall theoretical scheme applies to Asian Americans. For instance,
Asian Americans might initiate unique coping strategies because they perceive
stress in a culturally distinct manner. This was evidenced in the Experience section
of this chapter, which illustrated that Asians may perceive or organize stress on
a primarily somatic basis, which in turn influences their help-seeking behavior.
Third, such instances of cultural variability should be organized to formulate a
new model of psychopathology that builds on the theories of existing models.
The stress-coping model might therefore develop into a more complex model
that accounts for the influence of cultural attitudes, beliefs, problem perception,
and even traditional health practices that are embedded in Asian cultures.


This conceptual scheme integrates the multimethod and parallel assessment
approaches mentioned earlier. For instance, the overall stress-coping model may
be considered etic in nature, but cultural differences might exist within its individual
elements. Using the parallel assessment approach, an emic measure can
then be developed that better identifies and measures the construct within the
Asian American population. The integration of emic elements thus contributes
to the relevance and validity of the overall model.


These conceptual issues in the study of Asian American psychopathology can
be examined using a two-stage methodological strategy. In the first stage, a microanalysis
of a heterogeneous Asian American sample can be performed. This
would entail gathering data on indigenous conceptualizations and expressions
of psychopathology from a small cross section of Asian American groups through
a series of in-depth interviews. This would allow researchers to identify important
cultural constructs of mental health and to estimate group differences or heterogeneity
across Asian American populations. The second stage would involve the
evaluation of the data gathered from the first stage on a macro level using a larger
sample. However, practical constraints would prevent in-depth analysis of a
