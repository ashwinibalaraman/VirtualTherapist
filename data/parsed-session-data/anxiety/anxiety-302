—DRYDEN, <i>Horace</i>


<i>Friday, 9 October</i>


The male nurse attendant called me aside. "As far as I can
see, you act rational as hell," he said. "But the doctor says you
believe a certain dead man is still alive. Is that right?"


"Yes."


"Would you care to tell me about it?"


"It's a long story."


"Well, the doctors have decided to give you metrazol for
treatment."


"Does it knock you out?"


That was what I wanted to know most of all. I wanted to
feel and know what was happening to me; I wanted to be aware
of what was going on. I was afraid of Nothingness—of things
happening while I was just a limp, lifeless body or a body that
acted while the mind was Nowhere. It would be the same as

[p. <i>195</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Today it probably won't knock you out," he said. "It is a
fluid injection in the vein. We start with 3 c.c.'s and increase
the amount until you are knocked out and have a seizure. The
idea is to make your mind a blank for a brief period, hoping
that when you come to it will run in a different channel than
before."


"How many will I have to take?"


"Until you believe that this man is dead."


Gee, I hate to have to take them indefinitely. Oh, well, you
will give up eventually.


Later in the morning my name was called and I stepped into
the bedroom. Limp bodies of shock-treatment patients were on
half-a-dozen beds. My vacant bed was waiting. I felt thankful,
at least, that I was not getting shock again.


"We are going to give you a treatment that will make you
well," cheerfully announced Dr. Schultz.


"I'm tickled to death."


"No, you are not going to die. It will make you well."


"I said I'm tickled to death."


There was a kind of hard pillow for support beneath the
small of my back. My shoes were off. The gauze went into my
mouth. So far it was just the same as shock treatment.


"Double your fist a few times," someone said.


Half-a-dozen people were around me. My arms and legs were
held securely. Would the fluid make of me a jumping, fighting
maniac?


The metrazol was injected. Quickly it ran up my arm, into my
chest. I thought it felt like the smell of ether. My heart began
to thump away very fast. Now I close my eyes and wait for the
blackout. The time called Now will pass; the time called Later
will come. But Later does not help me now.


Things began to get better; the fluid was wearing off. Was
that all there was to it? That wasn't so bad. I opened my eyes
again.

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Are you nervous?" a voice inquired.


I was silent. If you want me to talk, take this gauze out of
my mouth.


"Are you nervous?" came the question again.


"I was that way before I came in here."


This brought laughter. How keen my mind is! How witty
my remarks!


Later in the day, the head nurse asked me, "How are you?"


"All right. I'm not complaining."


"Good! That's the way."


How cheerful! How like the way one would pet and compliment
a baby that has behaved itself!


"I never have complained, have I?"


"No, you haven't."


And I never will, I thought. To complain would imply that
I no longer believed Mr. Armstrong was looking out for me. I
wouldn't complain if they killed me. But I wouldn't like it,
either.


<i>Monday, 12 October</i>


Certainly there won't be treatment on Columbus Day, I
thought. But the treatment patients from the ward above were
brought down to wait for it.


"So there's treatment, after all?"


"I don't know," the attendant said. "But we are getting everything
ready just in case."


How considerate of the attendant to let the patients worry
rather than to disturb the doctor by calling up and finding out!


Let me play pinochle, get interested in taking tricks and piling
up a score. Forget my worries. Forget how in younger days
I did not believe in wasting my time with cards; when I believed
that every minute of the day should be filled with thinking
and learning; when I even begrudged the time I had to spend
sleeping at night. Forget this, just do anything so as not to have
to think and worry about what might make my heart pump hard
and knock me out—but really not hurt me. Just live, act mechanically,

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. List came in. He placed a hand on my shoulder as I
played cards. It was a friendly gesture.


"How are you?"


What a time to ask!


"How is the supply of metrazol?" was my reply.


"No treatment today. It's a holiday."


Did he think me stupid for not knowing? Now I have worried
in vain. Better to take the treatment now—now that I have
already paid the price for it in worry; better now than make me
worry again another day.


Hank, my pinochle partner, asked, "Did you get my letter,
Doctor?"


"No."


"My brother died. I wrote you asking if I could attend the
funeral this afternoon."


"You won't get too depressed?"


"No."


"I'll have the attendants call your family. You can talk to
them on the phone. If they want to come after you, you can go."


I can't remember Hank ever having been out for the day
since I came here. Dr. List did not have to consider him. No,
and he didn't have to let me work at the weaving shop (a privilege
I enjoy) or let me go home Sundays during my series of
treatments. No one else I know of has those privileges while
taking treatment.


And that's the trouble. These "brain washers," these "temporary
executioners"—they mean well. The treatments are their way
of trying to help me. I cannot hate them; I cannot fight them. I
must resign my body to their will, and give them every opportunity
to "knock those ideas out of my head."


No matter. My mind will not give in, which is the important
thing.


<i>Wednesday, 14 October</i>


The treatment patients from the ward above came down.

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Last Friday they ran out of metrazol, so they gave me shock
instead," one of them said.


That's strange, I thought. I hope they don't do that to me.
He continued, "On the outside, the private doctors give you a
nerve pill if you want it—take one of those and it doesn't bother
you to wait for treatment. But here they don't give a damn!"


The minutes ticked away while I played cards, waiting. Time
passed. No one came.


"Call the doctor and tell him I'm not in the habit of being
kept waiting," I told the attendants. They laughed. I have quite
a sense of humor.


Dr. Schultz came down later, consulted for a few minutes
with the attendants, then announced, "No treatmentl" The patients
from the ward above went back upstairs. There were sighs
of relief.


But why that worry in vain? The price in worry had been
paid—but would this reduce the total number of treatments?


<i>Thursday, 15 October</i>


I never heard of treatment on Thursday before. But today
we had it. Dr. Schultz came early, so there was little time in
which to worry—so yesterday's worry in vain paid for the lack
of worry today. How very just!


There was only the one doctor today and no pretty nurses.
But enough attendants were present.


"Here is one who is always afraid," Dr. Schultz cheerfully
remarked as I entered the bedroom.


Am I supposed to be happy?


I sprawled on the bed again and said, "Each grab a limb,"
as men approached to do just that.


"How many?" I asked.


"Five. Nothing may happen this time, either."


I hope not. Maybe I can take it. Three c.c.'s last time, five
this time.


The fluid seemed to take effect faster than before, though I
didn't notice my heart pounding as much. Here it comes, like

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I took it and didn't pass out or go into a fit! I'm tough. I can
take it. Nothing to worry about. Another patient was coming in.
Poor fellow—he has to take shock like these other poor fellows
on the beds. I'm lucky. I was even conscious through the whole
thing.


"If you're giving more treatment, I don't want to stay."


I walked out as an attendant moved over to help me.


"I'm all right."


I began to feel real well—almost as well as before I was first
sent to the hospital last January. I could take what they gave me!


Later, I asked the nurse-attendant, "How much will I get
next time?"


"Six. It is increased by one each time until you have a
seizure, then you get that amount until you have had a certain
number of seizures."


I like the way he always gives it to me straight. He is much
better than people who try to kid me.


Maybe I can take six c.c.'s, I thought The doctor says he
has given up to nine. I probably can't take that many. But I will
try. I hope so. I want to hold out as long as possible, even though
it only means an increase in the total number of treatments they
will give me. It is the only kind of fighting back I can do.


<i>Friday, 16 October</i>


"Don't eat breakfast. You are getting treatment."


"I used to eat before treatment."


"The doctor is coming early today." (Therefore any food
would not be settled in the stomach before treatment and might
come back up.)


Good. Get it over with.


The treatment patients from the ward above ate breakfast.
A patient in my ward who had treatment yesterday also ate.
Maybe I'm getting a good dose of metrazol—enough for a quick
knockout and a good seizure. I hear in another building they

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Wait for the ax to fall. Be a fatalist—what will come will
come; there is no way out.


But today it didn't come. They had run out of metrazol. I
was saved for another day.


How fortuitous! Life must be like waiting for treatment. Success
or failure is like the toss of a coin and one just has to take
what comes while we "await alike the inevitable hour." In the
end we will all be dead, anyway.


<i>Friday, 23 October</i>


On Monday and Wednesday both there was the worry over
treatment coming, then the joy at hearing: "No metrazol. You
can go to work at the weaving shop." If only this skipping treatment
will mean that the total number to come will be reduced.
What crazy, wishful thinking!


Last night I didn't feel like reading; it was an effort to concentrate.
I thought I had been worrying less about treatment,
but the thought persisted, "Will the next one knock me out and
give me a seizure? They will certainly have some metrazol in by
now! You can't fight the inevitable!"


This morning again came the remark, "No metrazol."


I felt like asking Dr. List, "How many treatments will it take
to convince you that you were right when you said that it would
do no good to give me further treatment?"


<i>Friday, 13 November</i>


Practically a month has gone by without treatment. One Friday
the announcement was made that metrazol had come in, so
I waited for it—but the supply wasn't large enough to warrant
wasting it on treatment.


Always there was the possibility of getting treatment, but

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So today it came in. There were a lot of people taking treatment.
One by one they were called in, metrazol and shock patients
both. Finally, only I was left, and they didn't call me.


One of the metrazol patients who had gone in after me on
other treatment days went in and came back out again. "I think
I heard them say, ‘Hold Moore back,’" he remarked after his
wits had returned.


That is what happened. The attendant later said that someone
from the women's ward came over to take back a syringe
which she needed. And they couldn't measure my dose without
it, or something.


<i>Monday, 16 November</i>


It wasn't too bad waiting for treatment this morning, though
I was a bit restless. Can it be that I'm learning to be philosophical—or
fatalistic?


The first fellow who gets treatment joked about paying a
brief visit to the Other World. It's funny the way time works.
He is here when they call his name and when he lies down on
the table waiting for the electric shock; then suddenly he is Nowhere;
but a minute later here he is again.


Or does he really visit the Other World? Funny, I sometimes
think, that those people who die for even half an hour and are
brought back to life because the doctor massages their heart
or something—funny, isn't it, that even they cannot tell us firsthand
about heaven, or wherever one is when one isn't here. If,
perhaps, one patient could remember where he was while
knocked out, how he might shock the world! That is, if the
world would believe him, which it wouldn't.


A very active man of about seventy-two years was called.

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally my name was called and I waited a minute, then went
in. It's the same principle when men fight in war, I thought.
The men are not so brave. They just do what they are told. What
is coming next is a vague apprehension. If they live, they're
lucky. If they die—well, that is something others do to them.
And by the time it happens, it is too late, anyway.


What am I doing here? I just answer the truth when my
beliefs are questioned. It isn't so bad walking into the bedroom.
I know how to lie down on the bed. And by that time it feels
bad being completely at the mercy of these people, unable to
exercise a will or a wish of my own. But, well, it's out of my
hands now, too, so just take what comes.


"Six?" I asked.


"Yes. Same as last time."


"It was five last time."


Oh, he checks on that."


The gauze wasn't put in my mouth until the fluid was already
injected. And I wanted it in now. I wanted something to bite
my teeth down on, to sort of get a grip on myself. I didn't want
my teeth to click together if the seizure came.


The heavy breathing again. Am I passing out? Well, I can
do that. It's like dying, but it's like going to sleep, too—they're
both the same. One of the nurses raised my hand and let it drop
back limp. No, there was no seizure this time. I didn't pass out.
They'll have to increase the dose again to get me. I'm fooling
them still.


I began to feel well. Most patients went out on the second
treatment, and I had taken three. They weren't really bad. I
knew what was happening to me. And when the dose will be
increased enough to really knock me out—well, I know it will be
just a little more than what I could take before.


It's better than the shock treatments where one never knows
what hit him.

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Wednesday, 18 November</i>


<i>About five minutes after treatment:</i>


They called the first patient for treatment. I walked over to
see how far down the list I was. One of the nurses came in late.


"What's the idea holding us up!" I yelled.


"All right, come on," Dr. Schultz said, cheerfully.


"Hey, that's a dirty trick!"


Like the lamb to the slaughter, I went in.


"Seven this time?"


"Yes, seven."


So, the gauze in my mouth, the injection, the stuff coming,
the heavy breathing, and still I hadn't gone out. The doctor
acted surprised. "How does it feel?" he asked.


So I told him.


Again I asked to leave and this time they let me, because
shock patients were next. I was a little wobbly, but feeling well.


"Eight next time?"


"Don't be so curious about next time so soon," Dr. Schultz
replied.


Hooray! I'm still stickin' with it!


P.S. After treatments were over the nurse-attendant came out.


"I guess we'll have to use a club to knock you out!"


"Is he going to increase it next time?"


"Sure. We've got to until we get that reaction. Why, these
don't even count."


I guess in the long run a fellow just can't win.


<i>Friday, 20 November</i>


<i>About 5 minutes after:</i>


8 C.C.'S this time. I'm still breathing heavy and my teeth almost
felt like chattering after I came out—but still I was not
knocked out.


Dr. List was here with Dr. Schultz. He asked about my book.


9 c.c.'s I hear is the most they have ever given.

[p. <i>204</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

P.S. Later, when the doctor was leaving, I yelled behind him.
"Nine Monday?"


There was no answer.


<i>Monday, 23 November</i>


<i>Treatment 6</i>


<i>About six minutes and two or three treatments later (i.e., after
two or three other patients have had treatment):</i>


Still 8 c.c.'s, they said. They said some leaked out of the vein
last time. It felt like more—but I didn't go out. I came out and
played half a hand of cards. But it was hard to be interested.


P.S. A few minutes later I sat down between two shock patients
and helped them stare into space.


This treatment almost got me. There was no pain but I moved
in the bed, which probably was the beginning of a seizure, and
I felt as though I was relieving myself, or something.


Afterwards my jaw felt stiff. My head felt as if the nerves
had been tightened or strengthened. It was like post-shock treatment
last spring. And during the week end it felt that way, too,
though then I began to wonder: what if my brain did go?


<i>Wednesday, 25 November</i>


<i>About 7 hours after treatment:</i>


Dr. List spoke to me before the treatment. He asked about
my book. I told him he could see the letters from the literary
agent if he wanted to.


"No, that isn't necessary. I believe you."


I happened to mention that the agent recommended I sell
my book as a fiction story.


"You see," he exclaimed. "As a fiction story it would be a
best seller."


But as a true story it would not, he implied.


So you don't believe me after all, I thought.


"How much this time?" I asked while waiting for the injection.

[p. <i>205</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No one answered.


The gauze went into my mouth. An attendant held his hand
to my jaw just in case.


The next thing I remember I was tossing on the bed.


"What day is it?"


"You know."


"No, I don't."


I knew it was treatment day but that was all.


"It's Wednesday."


"Did I have a seizure?"


"Yes."


"How long have I been out?"


"Forty-five minutes."


I came out to the dayroom, tried to lie down on a bench.
Then they let me go back to the bedroom. I skipped the noon
meal and slept off and on the whole day. After I had vomited
on the floor, they brought a bucket with water in it for me to
use. I used it a few times, though little came out each time. My
lip had been bitten, though not enough to be sore. I had a
headache. And I kept feeling stuffy hot or chilly cold.


P.S. Later I threw up my supper.


NOTE: I don't know of anyone else so hard to knock out and
who got so sick afterward. An attendant said the reason it took
so long to knock me out only meant that my system was more
tolerant of that particular drug. But when it got me, it really
took hard.


<i>Monday, 30 November</i>


<i>Treatment 8:</i>


Knocked cold again. Headache. Ate next to nothing. Slept
all day.


<i>Wednesday, 2 December</i>


<i>Treatment 9:</i>


Vomited several times.

[p. <i>206</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recovered better, went bowling with a group of other patients.


<i>Friday, 4 December</i>


<i>Treatment 10:</i>


Still nine c.c.'s, but building resistance and wasn't quite
knocked out, though eyelids fluttered and I was on the edge.
Dr. Schultz tapped my stomach for reaction.


<i>Monday, 7 December</i>


<i>Treatment 11:</i>


Nine and a half c.c.'s.


Knocked out.


Friday, 11 December


Treatment 12:


Nine and a half c.c.'s.


Not quite knocked out.


Monday, 14 December


Knocked out and sick all day, though they said the amount
given me wasn't increased.


(P.S. Larger opening in needle so I got the shot faster.)


Wednesday, 16 December


<i>Treatment 14:</i>


Not quite knocked out. Needle in smoking room. Wheeled
me out to bedroom this time.


Friday, 18 December


<i>Treatment 15</i>


<i>About five minutes after:</i>


Dr. List.


Hurt my arm but didn't quite knock me out.

[p. <i>207</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121811-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

P.S. After that, there were no more metrazol treatments for
me. The doctors had given up before I had given in. My position
stood as it always had.
