The bright sun could not dispel the icy terror in which my body and
mind were gripped on the January morning that I went to the
courthouse to sign commitment papers for my husband to enter the
State Hospital at Raleigh. I answered questions in a fog of pain and
despair. One final crushing blow was added to all the humiliation
and unreality of what I was doing: the request that I direct the ambulance
driver to bring the patient to the courthouse to allow the
sheriff to sign appropriate papers. This I would never do--I would
save him the possibility of such public attention.


Again I was foiled in my effort to make things easier and prevent
further hurt. I thought back to the first fears I'd had that Fred was
working too hard and worrying too much--to the many sleepless
hours we'd spent as he tossed and turned, unable to sleep after a late
counseling session or a church meeting which had not come up to
his expectations.


The thought had never occurred to me that Fred would have a
nervous breakdown, for I had often heard him say that overwork
never caused one. He had always been able to sleep anywhere, any
time, under any conditions. If he had often worried in the past, he
had concealed it from me. But more and more I was plagued with

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During those months Fred was restless. He was in a constant whirl
of activity. He filled his days and nights with work. Every problem
seemed to take on the proportions of a grave crisis until a satisfactory
solution could be reached--and some couldn't be solved. Then he
couldn't sleep, and he often suffered severe chest pains, but always
refused to let me call a doctor. On several occasions he woke me with
the same moaning cry of agony, but always refused to tell the nature
of the nightmares he suffered.


On our trip to the West Coast, Fred was his gay self most of the
time during the day, but at night he slept little. He had an abnormal
fear that we would have an accident and that I would be hurt. This
was very unlike his usual easygoing manner. Hitherto he had always
enjoyed traveling, when he could relax, with no anxieties over travel
conditions, time schedules, or driving.


A few weeks before the trip he had rushed back to Raleigh from
out of town and had played a hard tennis match in ninety-seven-degree
heat. Before the match was completed, he collapsed on the
court. As a result, he secured the doctor's permission to take a trip
to fulfill his speaking engagement at an international convention
only on the condition that he not do too much driving. But whether
at the wheel or in the back seat, he drove every mile of the way. The
trip did not bring him the needed rest and relaxation we had hoped
for.


All my persuasive powers had not been able to keep Fred from fulfilling
what he felt was a divine mission on that November Sunday
ten weeks earlier. My first real warning of impending disaster had
come early on Sunday morning when he asked me to drive him to
the church. No matter how short the distance, he had always driven
the car himself. This was strange; but it was even more shocking to

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As he stood in the pulpit, at times preaching eloquently, and at
others lapsing into personal narrative which had little meaning to
the majority, I felt as though my body were being lashed with a
whip. I sank lower into my seat, and a feeling of nausea flooded me--
a feeling which was to plague me for weeks to come. Surely, I'd
never be able to leave the church without help.


Then followed the long week when I tried to play ostrich, assuring
myself that nothing was wrong. Yet deep inside I knew that everything
was wrong; but I thought: "I'll wait a little longer. Fred will
get himself under control. Surely he won't break down. I am the
one with nerves--not Fred. He has helped too many others to overcome
their own nervous tensions; surely he can save himself. But
if he can't--where shall I turn for help?"


Chaplain Steininger of State Hospital came to my rescue.
Through him, the doctors, and Fred's brothers and friends, Fred
was finally entered in Graylyn.


Graylyn--how beautiful in its outward setting of peace! How
comforting it had been to my strained nerves and emotions to hear
the reassurances of doctors--and to leave with others the burden of
indecision and turmoil and responsibility which had weighed so
heavily upon me!


But even at Graylyn I had not been able to save Fred from treatment
of which I knew he did not approve. After Fred had visited
hospital patients, I had heard him say several times, "I would never
sign for any member of my family to have electric shock treatments."
At the time it had meant nothing to me. Our family had never had
any nervous disorders--it couldn't happen to us. So, in spite of much
persuasion on the part of the assistant doctor and my brothers-in-law,
I refused to sign the paper giving permission for use of electric

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But as I opened the door upon my return from Graylyn, the phone
was ringing. Dr. Proctor was persuasive but emphatic. I had to give
my permission immediately, for delay might mean life or death. But
during these long weeks of silence from Fred, the fear had been persistent:
"Did I do the right thing? What does he think of me? Will
he ever forgive me? I did to him what he had said he would never
do to me."


After my trip to Graylyn to talk to Dr. Proctor and other members
of the staff, it was good to settle down to family routine. Many
friends had offered to stay with us at night, but I felt that the children
had had too many changes and been exposed to too much unusual
excitement, and would be better off to get back to our normal
everyday life. It had not been unusual for Fred to be absent at mealtimes
and in the evenings, because of the full schedule of work he
had been carrying. I had been assured that after a few weeks, and
then a vacation, Fred would be back at work. Gradually, the children
relaxed, and happy smiles came back to their faces. But at the end
of the first week, our medical report was not good. Because Fred had
not shown any remarkable progress, the great flood of doubt and fear
returned. There were so many phone calls and visits from friends
who were trying to reassure me and at the same time find reassurance
themselves. This role was one of the most difficult I had to sustain
during the entire experience. I was in great need of someone to reassure
me and to serve as go-between for the hospital, church, and
family. Yet I was the only one who could do so.


Holidays during personal tragedy are always hard. It became obvious
that we would not be enjoying Thanksgiving with our families
in Virginia as planned. It would be a long, lonely day for us. But
the Sunday-school class which Fred taught thought ahead to that.
Together they planned and sent a bountiful Thanksgiving dinner--

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thanksgiving over, we began thinking of Santa Claus. Kenneth
wanted an electric train, and Mary Margaret and Becky wanted
clothes for their tiny dolls. With enthusiasm, I bought patterns and
materials for a complete wardrobe. But I found I often had difficulty
threading the needle because my hand shook so, and it wasn't always
easy to cut in a straight line. But I tackled those clothes as though my
life depended on it. And possibly it did. Just so much tension and
pressure can be endured, and then the breaking point comes. Mary
Margaret still says that I should have entered the clothes in the state
fair. Certainly they were the prettiest I had ever made. Added to
the joy they gave two little girls on Christmas morning, they helped
me over some of the most crucial weeks of my life.


The first real suggestion that Fred might have to be moved to a
different hospital did not come from Dr. Proctor, but from another
medical doctor. The intimation was very clear that his might be a
hopeless case and that extreme measures might have to be taken.
Alone in the house at the time, I was plunged into blackest despair.
In addition, I had a feeling of real rebellion against a God who could
be so unfair as to punish Fred in such a way. I felt he didn't deserve
it. The thought of his living in abnormal circumstances for the rest
of his life was more than I could stand and still love God, who, I felt,
could change such a verdict. Over and over I thought: "Why
couldn't he have died? He would have been so much better off!
Death would have been more merciful for him and his family. Anything
would be better than this verdict."


When I was again capable of rational thought, I kept telling myself,
"Why should I believe this verdict?" Dr. Proctor had continued
to tell me he would get well, but he wasn't sure how long it would

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The great sin of my very thoughts overwhelmed me when I attended
the funeral of the husband of a friend. How ashamed I felt!
Here was death in its awful finality. I still had the life of my husband,
with all the hope and faith that life should give. And I had been
guilty of asking that that life be taken away. I had felt that I was
wiser than God--that God was punishing us as we didn't deserve.
Indeed, any punishment was not too much for me now.


But with the beautiful and comforting words of the funeral service,
a peace came into my soul that I had not known for many
months. And with it came a spirit of real thanksgiving that my
husband still lived and that I could have the faith that someday he
would again resume his place in our household. The world had
suddenly become a happier place. From that day on, my thoughts
were not if Fred returns, but when Fred returns.


For the children Christmas without their daddy was much more
difficult than Thanksgiving had been. But a trip to their grandparents
and happy times playing with cousins helped change the
monotony and lonely routine at home. But, "I wish Daddy were
here," could often be heard at even the most happy times. His name
was never omitted from their bedtime prayers, and God was often
also asked "to make Daddy well" during grace before meals. For me,
his absence created even more of an aching void, especially at home

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Still bolstered by the faint hope that after the holidays Fred would
be able to leave the hospital for a Florida vacation, it was with a
spirit of anticipation that we returned home. Each morning, upon
awaking, the thought of what had happened would flood over me
and the old nausea would return. The sight of my African violets
blooming brightly in the kitchen window never failed to help dispel
this feeling of pain, and brought the hope that today perhaps the
good news would come that Fred could be released.


In the meantime I had to keep busy with normal everyday affairs.
My inability to eat or sleep soundly had caused me to lose twenty
pounds. I was convinced, for the sake of my children and for that of
the church, that I could not continue idly worrying. Because the
president of our Christian Women's Fellowship had moved out of
town, as vice president I was asked to fill the vacancy. I accepted
the office with misgiving, but with the feeling that our church was
being so good to us that I could not refuse to serve in any way they
asked me. Being close to the work of the church and its leaders in
this period of crisis helped me to see our family problem in better
perspective. It helped to melt away much of my resentment toward
persons who I felt had misjudged and had been a trial to my husband
in the past. Never did I make a call on the aged and shut-ins during
this time that I did not leave with a feeling of shame that I had
pitied myself so much, when in truth I had so very much for which
to thank God. By being active in the service of others, I found the
best help to my own problems.


Our hope of an early Florida vacation was shattered one cold
bleak January Monday. The long-awaited phone call came. Dr.
Proctor's voice did not have its usual cheerfulness. "Mrs. West, we
aren't doing any good. I've called State Hospital and made all arrangements.
Please go to see the clerk of court, sign the commitment
papers, and then go to the hospital for an interview. I'll send Fred

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But once more I would try to escape the seemingly inevitable.
I'd call his brother. Surely he would see that I couldn't sign papers
committing my husband to a state mental institution! But he agreed
with Dr. Proctor that we had no choice. It was the end of the road.
My world and that of our children had collapsed.


I had not insisited that I see Fred after Dr. Proctor had said it
would be best that I wait. The words of one of Fred's loyal friends
and admirers came back to haunt me. "Why don't you ask Dr. West
what hospital he'd like to go to? I'll bet he would know what he
should do." Again it was too late for that. I seemed to have been
pushed into a decision as revolting to me as many others I had had
to make in the past weeks.


Now I must put my name on the paper which would take away
his freedom as a citizen and make him little more than a prisoner of
the state, and which would entrust his physical and mental welfare
to a great, impersonal organization of whose efficiency I had grave
doubt. No greater anguish of soul or torture of mind could be
imagined than that which I experienced in writing my signature on
that document.


My appointment to see the social worker and to sign the necessary
papers was on the morning before Fred was to arrive about noon.
What longing I had to see him and talk to him! Dr. Proctor had
assured me that Fred was willing to go to the hospital at Raleigh.
If Fred had agreed, why couldn't I stay to see him? Ten weeks had
been long without a visit or a letter. But again came that old doubt
and fear--I had done so many things I felt Fred wouldn't have
wanted done. Now if I stayed to see him, and if he asked me to take
him home instead of putting him in the hospital, how could I refuse?


As the hour of noon approached, I drove down the winding side
drive of the hospital. At the foot of the hill my heart almost broke

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By nightfall, Raleigh was closed in by a storm of sleet and snow.
But as the skies darkened and the wind blew outside, our little world
inside became brighter and happier than it had been in many weeks.
The children were in a gayer mood. "Daddy is in Raleigh, and soon
we can go to see him and he can come home!" Their eyes sparkled
as they made plans of what they would send him. Mary Margaret's
first wish that we bring his soiled clothes home to launder could
now be realized. Their happiness was not marred by my own doubts
and fears and sense of calamity. But the chaplain's phone call saying
that he had seen Fred and that he'd asked about me and the children
quieted many of my fears.


It was a day to remember for a lifetime.


However, the happiness of the moment was fleeting. Reality could
be denied for a time, but with the morning came a new day and new
problems to be faced. New doctors had to be met, and there were
new hospital routines and requirements to be learned.


Visiting a ward in a state mental institution is a chilling experience.
I picked my way through mud and water caused by construction
work and the previous day's storm. The cold gray exterior of
State Hospital was no less cheerful than the small waiting room in
which I found myself. I might have shut my eyes and pretended that
I was in the average doctor's waiting room except for the constant
jangling of keys as white-clothed attendants came and went. To my
horror, each time the door was opened it was carefully locked again.
Locked doors and barred windows I was not prepared for. With
added force, the dreadfulness of what had happened numbed my
very being.


The young doctor was friendly, and concerned for the welfare of
Fred and of Fred's family. But he did not inspire in me any of the
feeling of confidence and trust that I had always received at Graylyn.


About a week after Fred's arrival at State Hospital I received a

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I immediately set out for State Hospital. No one can imagine how
I dreaded the visit. My heart was pounding and my hands were
shaking, for again I feared bad news. As I looked up at the barred
windows of the gloomy building, I once more found it hard to realize
that Fred belonged within those walls.


The young doctor seemed surprised to see me again, but he was
quite cordial. In answer to my questions, he assured me that Fred
was fine and that he was adjusting nicely to his new surroundings.
He said that at the moment, Fred was at the movies. He asked when
I had last seen him. Upon learning that it had been more than two
months, he was greatly concerned and asked me to wait to let him
find out if the three-week ruling could not be disregarded in this
case. I waited and waited, growing more excited each quarter-hour.
I was completely unprepared for a first meeting--almost frightened.
What should I do and say? What would Fred be like? At long last
the young doctor returned with a stricken look on his face, and in
a tone of abject apology frankly told me he had been wrong. He had
thought Dr. West was doing well but he had learned that my husband
had had a setback five days ago and had been moved to another
building by another doctor. He would investigate and report to me
as soon as he could.


My panic knew no measure. I could not help admiring the young
doctor for his honesty, and I was grateful for his genuine concern.
But the feeling that Fred was no longer receiving the personal
attention of a gifted psychiatrist, and the fact that even his whereabouts

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Immediately, my thoughts went to the chaplain who had befriended
us in the beginning of Fred's illness and who had followed
his progress at Graylyn with friendly concern. He had phoned to
give me good news of Fred's condition upon arriving at State Hospital.
Surely he would help. But Chaplain Steininger was visiting in
the wards, and his secretary didn't know just when he would return.
I settled down for a long wait. I would not leave until I had some
definite news. My trust in the chaplain was not in vain. He listened
attentively to my account. When I had finished, he gently told me
not to worry. He said that he knew where Fred was and that he had
visited him since his transfer. He could not give me the assurance
that he was as well as when he first came from Graylyn; but he did
assure me that all was being done that could be done, and that he
was having the proper attention and medication to prepare him to
enter the insulin ward of the Royster Building almost immediately.
Once again the church through its chaplain had come to minister
to me in an hour of great need.


There was at least hope in my heart as I left State Hospital, as
well as gratitude for the kindness of a nurse who may have risked
her job to help me, and for the help of a Christian chaplain who was
serving in his own quiet way.


Slowly the days passed, and I heard unofficially that Fred had been
transferred to the insulin ward in the Royster Building. I knew that
these patients were supposed to have the best treatment from
doctors and attendants and that there was a comparatively small
number of them. Some of my tenseness vanished, and once more I
began to think more constructively of the future. Increasingly, I
felt that I should like to be doing something with my time to help
Fred when he was well again. I knew that one of the things which
had worried him most was his failure to write the books he had

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697833-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After three months what would Fred be like? Would he have
changed in his physical appearance? Would he be aged? A dream
I had had continued to come back to me. I had dreamed that I saw
Fred and that his hair was white. Over and over, this sight haunted
me. Had his suffering been that great?


How would he treat me? Would he resent all of the things I had
had to do for his self-interest? Would he feel that I had not been
true to the trust he had put in me not to have him hospitalized, not
to consent to electric shock therapy? And he had said that if it should
ever be necessary to have him treated by a psychiatrist, to engage
one with an understanding of religious influences and problems.
How far that was from a state institution! Would he be rational in
his demands for future care, or would I once again have to turn my
back on his cries for help? So much of the success or failure of the
past three months and the future might depend on these few
minutes! No one had told me what to do, how to act, what to say.


As I drove slowly up the drive to State Hospital, I felt helpless,
and unequal to the task ahead. The joy of reunion was overshadowed
by the immensity of my problem. I felt as though the weight of the
world was on my shoulders, and as though the eyes of the world
were on me as I walked to the door of the hospital.
