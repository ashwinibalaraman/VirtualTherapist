Days plod by. Have I been in this place only a week? Have
I ever been anywhere else? Already the days and nights
have become depressingly predictable. They are anesthetizingly
the same.


I awake with a vague awareness of myself, followed
quickly by anxiety and nausea. Another precious day had
been lost and nothing gained. Soon the nurse comes by. In
her impersonal detached way she asks, "How do we feel
this morning?" She means well, but she doesn't hear my
answer, or she doesn't like my answer. So after a few days
I quit answering. They probably note on my chart, "sullen,
withdrawn, and flattened affect." She pops a pill in my
mouth (a stimulant), I close my eyes again, and gradually
the nausea subsides.


Out of the bed, slowly, numbly, leadenly. To the bathroom
where I try not to look at myself, and then on to
breakfast. Various patients and staff sit around the dining
room (which is also the dayroom). They are drinking coffee,
smoking cigarettes, crying, or sometimes eating. Finally,
that's over. Back to the room; make up the bed. (This is good
therapy.) Then we wait.

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Depending on the day, we may bunch up and descend to
the ground floor to the workshop. Here a crafts teacher
(occupational therapist) does her earnest best to convince us
it is dignified and adult to aspire to, and actually make, a
beaded wallet or a potholder or a looped belt.


Occupational therapists believe in what they are doing.
Books have been written and college courses taught that
deal exclusively and exhaustively with the therapeutic possibilities
of arts and crafts. In my opinion, any activity must
be intrinsically worthwhile before it can have therapeutic
possibilities. Frivolous activities are worthwhile, but not
when they are compelled to travel under the guise of serious
and profound import. There's nothing wrong with frivolous
occupation of one's time. But not everyone takes it seriously
when he builds a lamp or an ashtray. Occupational therapists,
though, seem to regard these "beading" sessions as
seriously as if one were building a digital computer. The
condescension involved in praising a grown man or woman
for a childish task is demeaning to those who do it and to
those to whom it is done.


The causes of most emotional disorders are generally unknown.
If you doubt this, observe the "treatment" in an
up-to-date psychiatric facility. There are drugs, lectures,
soul searching (religious therapy), social participation, arts
and crafts, electric shock, milieu therapy, music therapy,
psychotherapy; all of these things and others (there's even
garden therapy) are thrown at the poor patient. The apparent
hope is that something will help. That's not so bad. The
goal is desirable and valid. But, oh my, the defensiveness of
most psychiatrists and many psychologists. Almost without
exception, they bow to analytic theory, and their chant
is "the inhibition of instinctive drives and the resulting
conflict." In a nutshell, that's their explanation for the
"functional" mental aberrations. They may object to my
superficial statement. But, in defense, their lengthy explanations

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am sure that there must be swank psychiatric hospitals
where you get psychotherapy from an eminently qualified
person. But you'd better not be mentally ill and poor. That's
a deadly combination. And it's even tougher if you're unattractive
and semiliterate.


Perhaps the methods of psychotherapy can someday be
openly employed by other professional groups who have
sufficient and appropriate training. There is little in medical
training that is even nearly appropriate to the employment
of the technique. But it is often jealously guarded by some
as a medical prerogative even when the masses are crying for
help.


<b>The routine</b>


When we are through with our two hour "beading" session,
we head back to the ward. There are some patients still
back on the ward doing their "beading" there. They are too

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If it's one of three therapy days out of the week, I meet
my psychiatrist for about thirty minutes. I look forward to
this with hope. Maybe today something will happen.
Maybe I'll do something. Maybe he will. I am disappointed
one more time.


If you go to a teaching hospital, your therapist is likely
to be a young physician who has completed his medical
training and his internship and is now serving an apprenticeship
in a psychiatric setting. Such trainees are called
residents. You may be his first psychotherapy patient if he
is a beginning first-year resident. If you are fortunate
enough to get a resident in his final year, the third, he will
have had a fair amount of experience.


My session with him may be helpful if he is far enough
along in his training, if he is not preoccupied with whether
or not I am trying to manipulate him, or if he is not too
concerned about revealing his own hostility or anxiety. But
he is a learner. I am his subject matter. This might be quite
an interesting arrangement if I weren't spending all of my
money and much of my energy, and if I weren't desperately
afraid that I might never recover.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Vale sticks his head out of his office; he mumbles
something while looking miserably at the floor. Since I'm
scheduled for this time, I assume that it's my name he
called, and I walk into the tiny office. It's not his office
exclusively. Rather, it's one of those small, impersonal cubicles
used by various staff members.


I sit down, and Dr. Vale in his white coat with clipboard
in hand looks expectantly at me, pen poised.


"God," I say, "I just feel like hell. I have absolutely no
energy. I feel drained. Empty. Sick."


His pen flies over the pad on the clipboard. Rather startled
I wonder, "What the hell did I say?" No verbal response
from Dr. Vale. He's caught up now with his writing, and he
again cocks his eyebrows at me in anticipation.


As if on cue, I respond, "All I can think of is how afraid
and lonely I feel. I just feel sick at my stomach all the time.
I can never relax. I worry all the time if I can ever learn
somehow to live with myself."


Dr. Vale's pen leaps to life again, and he writes furiously,
trying to see his pad through the smoke of the cigarette
dangling from a corner of his mouth. Finally it looks as if
he's caught up, and I begin again. Actually, you can't say
a great deal in just thirty minutes when your therapist is
recording your words in longhand! After our fits and starts
of words and notes, our session is nearly over. I'm talking
now about the tension and pressure I feel. "Sometimes," I
say, "I feel as if it will build and build until I'll explode."


"Well," Dr. Vale responds (which takes me by surprise
since he seldom says anything), "don't do it here." He
stands up, signaling that the session is ended.


Another session is over. He has another pad full of notes.
No doubt he will describe to his therapy supervisor the
things I said which exemplify my "resistance," or my "ego

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Meals are usually pretty grim. There is little of the happy
social banter which accompanies most group meals. Then
too, there's not much appetite either. Sometimes there's an
exception. Today, George, a graduate biologist, is manic.
He's shoveling food into his mouth, gulping it down, meanwhile
humming and singing and swaying from side to side.
His nose starts to bleed, but he eats on, oblivious. His deliriously
"happy" torment is painful to see. He will leave the
hospital in a few weeks "improved." But in two months he
will take a massive dose of insect poison and die alone in
the woods. He will be missing for weeks before his body is
found.


I get up from the table and go back to the room. I wasn't
hungry anyway.


Another round-up after lunch. Everybody in the film
room. Today we see Mildred. She has a stomachache. Every
time her work gets stressful or things go wrong, Mildred's
stomach hurts. Then a flashback. We see Mildred as a little
girl. She is with her young sister, Babs, who takes Mildred's
toys away from her, spits on her, kicks her, and generally
makes her life miserable. But when Mildred finally gets fed
up and smashes Babs, her mother (watch it here, girls!)
rushes in and tells her that she is mean and ungrateful, and
hints darkly that mother won't love her if she beats hell out
of sister. Of course, that's it for Mildred.


Now she is grown up, and every time she has to cope with
an authority figure (mother), she becomes fearful (stomachache)
that she will be a failure (lose mother's love). So then
we all exclaim in wonder. Mildred is reacting to a childhood

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We exchange wise observations on how powerful childhood
emotional experiences are, and we troop back to the
ward. Meanwhile the psychiatrist who is leading the group
discussion departs with a satisfied expression on his face.
He has helped us develop "insight," he thinks. Big deal.
About all the poor patients get from this experience is some
little notice, greatly diluted, from someone (father) who has
the ability to solve problems (magic). Anyhow, our stomachs
still hurt and no doubt, so does poor, persecuted Mildred's.


A couple of days a week you are in a group therapy
session. But you still just talk about <i>things</i>. And I mean
"talk" in the most superficial meaning of the word. You talk
about how you feel, how you feel about someone else in the
group, how you think they feel about you. You try and try.
And sometimes you get tired of talking. So you just sit and
try to endure it. If you question this "therapy," you will be
told, "Because of the composition of the group, we have
limited goals for it." The white coat has spoken.


I think the basic fallacy with the techniques of psychotherapy
that have "limited goals" is that they deal with the
product and not the process. You trot out your anger, fear,
hostility, and other noxious emotions, and you examine and
talk "about" all of these feelings. But you don't actually
undergo the emotional experience of feeling these things.
Real sessions of therapy must engender fear, hostility, love,
hope, despair, and all the other feelings that make us human,
and, sadly, sometimes only humanoid. The sessions

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So dinner time finally comes along. Back to the tasteless
meal (not the cook's fault) and the growing realization that
another day has almost slipped away.


After dinner a few visitors come along. Most of them look
uncomfortable. They glance covertly from the corner of
their eyes, apparently expecting some wild, slobbering maniac
to spring on them at any moment. People sit in pairs
or small groups and talk. Two fellows play ping pong.
There's a bridge game underway and two or three people are
reading. A pastoral, serene scene, almost.


Bill is still talking softly to himself over in the corner.
And you can tell by his manner that occasionally someone
answers. Tom tries to talk to you for a minute, but he's so
anxious that he's doing a soft shoe routine and he forgets
what he was trying to tell you and wanders away looking
for something he can't seem to find. Far away, down the
long corridor, you can hear an occasional muffled scream.


<b>After awhile</b>


After three or four weeks in the hospital, I seemed to calm
down a bit. At least I wasn't visibly shaking. My bewilderment
was still great. I couldn't believe that this was me in
a ward of "crazy" people. There was old Mrs. Gold. She was

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Can I be as sick as they are? Mrs. Gold, for instance,
doesn't know why she's in the hospital, or even where she
is. Lately she has begun to call us by some new names. We
have concluded that she was using her children's and
friends' names. Occasionally she will go for three or four
days without eating. I haven't seen anybody come to visit
her. I guess somebody somewhere is paying the bill, though.


Then there's old Mr. Jump. The rumor is that the old man
is a millionaire. He founded a food processing company that
now specializes in various kinds of meat products. The
brand name of his foods was familiar to me. The old man
will sit in the dayroom and talk incessantly about "going to
the bathroom." He tries to go about every two or three
minutes, all day long. One attendant has to stay with him
all the time to keep him from injuring himself. I wonder
what will happen to him when his family gets tired of
spending <i>his</i> money on him and sends him to the state
mental hospital? You can bet that they won't have someone
sitting with him all day. The poor man is so agitated and
upset that he complains and cries and moans all day long.
Everybody on the ward is concerned.


<b>See evil, hear evil</b>


The paranoids among us are the most interesting, and, in
some ways, the most intact of the lot. I'm sure that you
could gather a group of mental patients together at random,
and you would be able to pick the paranoids by appearance
alone. At least this is true in the early stage of their disturbance.
Usually in apparently good physical condition, they

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Bill would soon leave the hospital. Forever, I hope. He
had been paranoid. He was a young, personable man; a
college graduate who was a field engineer for the telephone
company. We talked a lot together, and he told me what had
happened to him.


Bill had become suspicious that his colleagues and supervisors
were plotting against him. They had started out just
simply disliking him, so he thought. But soon they were
planning to fire him. Finally he became convinced that they
were going to kill him.


One day, he said, he got a pistol and took it to work with
him. During his lunch hour (he was careful not to use company
time) he went in to see his boss. He demanded to know
why everybody hated him, and he showed his boss the gun,
and told him that he was prepared if any of them tried to
get him.


He must have had an understanding boss. Bill said that
he was told to take a week off and come to the hospital to
see a psychiatrist. Bill was agreeable to this, he said, since
he had no fear that they would find anything but the
"truth," that his associates were out to get him.


I asked Bill what the psychiatrist had told him. "Well,"
he said thoughtfully, "he told me that I was sick, and that
I might spend the rest of my life in a mental hospital if I
didn't get treatment now."


I was curious: "How did that strike you?" He paused for
a moment. "You know," he said, "somehow I knew something
was wrong. So I decided to come here for a few days."
"How do you feel now?" I asked. "Do you still believe that
they are plotting to kill you?" He answered promptly, "No,

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Bill was essentially recovered. But he still harbored some
reservations. I could tell by his resistant manner that he still
was trying to make an irrational experience rational.


Some of my fellow patients wouldn't talk at all about
their fears and suspicions. Some, like Sue, had accepted the
fact that nobody else believed their stories, but like her they
hadn't been able to give them up themselves. She told me
one day, "I know that nobody believes that the FBI is bugging
my telephone. And I don't intend to say any more
about it. But I know damn well that they are doing it."


True to her word, she said nothing more about it. And if
anyone asked, she would smile and say, "I know that was
silly. I don't know how I ever came to believe it." In a few
weeks, she went home, probably still convinced that the FBI
was listening to her telephone conversations. In view of
recent events, I wonder if they were.


Although I was still depressed and miserable and couldn't
eat much or sleep, I wasn't interesting enough or obviously
"crazy" enough to fit in well. Attendants and nurses drifted
in to work, and in a few weeks most were gone. Frequently,
the least tactful ones would say, in effect, "What are you
doing here? You don't look nutty."


Far from pleasing me, not only did this kind of remark
seem presumptuous and prying, but it seemed to imply that
I was taking a rather unusual vacation. At first, I would try
to explain how I felt and why I needed treatment. But this
obviously bored them. Nothing is so depressing as depression.
Finally one middle-aged nurse's aide asked me what
I was doing here. I told her that I was a sex maniac and that
I had raped twelve women. I told her that I couldn't control
myself and that I might go berserk at any moment. She
hastened to put some distance between us. Although I am
sure she read my record and found out I was lying, she

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The physician patients among us usually were there because
of drugs. At least that's what they would say. This
must have been harder on them than it was on any other
professional person who was a patient. They were so accustomed
to maintaining a Godlike stance that it must have
been tough to be reduced to the status of not just patient,
but a mental patient, which is a considerably lower status
(even among mental patients!)


There is enough anguish and misery on a ward of mental
patients for the most practiced sadist. There are physically
recovering suicides. There are women who can't care for
their families and are worried about what may be happening
to their children. There are men who have lost their
chance at a decent livelihood and who know that a few
weeks or maybe months in a hospital will bankrupt them.
There are those who are harassed and tortured, night and
day, by voices others cannot hear. There are people who feel
so miserable and sad, and they may not know why, that
they would rather be dead. And there are those who hate
themselves and the rest of the world so much that they can
find no solace or love or compassion or peace. Indeed, they
can't even accept what is freely given. All in all, this is not
a promising place to try to regain your own humanity.


<b>Who's sick?</b>


I have come to know that this little group of miseries is
just a small sample of the burdens that people everywhere
carry with them. All desperate people are not in a hospital
somewhere. In fact, few are.


I seemed to be losing my humanness. After my initial
gain, I went downhill rapidly. I was periodically seized by
unexplainable, unexpected, and violent panics. I couldn't

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps it happened when dad caught me behind the bed
with my cousin Sally, engaged in anatomical research!?
Maybe it was the time I killed the cat with my new bow and
arrow set? Or was it when I flunked arithmetic in the fourth
grade and mother cried? Maybe it was because dad was
absent from home often, and I didn't get proper fatherly
love? Maybe my dependency needs were never satisfied?
Maybe I repress all my hostility toward authority figures?
Could it be that I have a thyroid deficiency or perhaps a
brain tumor?


You are compelled to search for simple, understandable
causes. And you believe that if you ever understand and
find those causes, you will be okay. But like most of those
things we wish were simple, it isn't.


I came to understand myself (I use this word in its most
restricted sense) more and more. I believe that I could write
an exhaustive, responsible, and objective account of my
psyche. How it came to be and its major dimensions and
characteristics. I even believe that I could present a pretty
fair psychodynamic account of my major personality conflicts
and difficulties. But all this avails me little. Now, I am
just a knowledgeable, miserable struggler. The only thing
that has been added to that statement is "knowledgeable."
Just as the biochemist describes the division of cancer cells
and is powerless to intervene in the process, so I was unable
to stop the malignant growth of my "cancer." It mattered
little that I had a pretty thorough understanding of what the
process entailed.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But this is an almost unavoidable paradox. You are compelled
to think about yourself and your behavior in psychological
terms. But this very understanding gets in the way
of benign, remedial growth. The probing and understanding
can become itself a part of the disease, perhaps even more
debilitating then the original complaint.


As the days and weeks went by, my knowledge of myself
and my problems increased. Concurrently, my depression
was increasing. The days blended one into another in a dull,
gray morass of monotonous inertia. My clarity in beginning
to see myself was matched by a concomitant deterioration
in my ability to cope with what I saw. Weeks became
months, and as I began to realize how little I had accomplished
in my grasping efforts to regain control of myself,
I was embittered and discouraged. Now I had a new set of
problems to cope with. At this point, I was struggling with
the hospitalization syndrome. My initiative and what little
drive I had left were consumed in becoming a product of the
ward routine. The mechanics of bathing, dressing, eating,
reporting to the various activities, and ostensibly participating
in the group and individual therapy sessions became
ends in themselves. To cope with the regime was now my
goal.


So, slowly but perceptibly, I went downhill. Four months
after I entered the hospital, I was more depressed and anxious
than I had been upon entering. Analysts will explain
this as treatment regression. An expected development. I am
in no position to argue this point, although it smacks of
rationalization to me. At any rate, I felt worse, however you
explain it. I had spent all of the money we had and put us
in hock for some years to come. I had been unable to take
a good job offer from a university that came about a month
after I came into the hospital. And I didn't know if I would
be permitted to complete my degree when and if I was able.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Giving up</b>


I had just about given up hope of ever enjoying anything
in life again. I had almost resigned myself to losing my wife
and our life together. After all, how long could she wait for
her life to resume? I was preparing myself for transfer to a
state mental hospital, although I was sure that I would not
endure this forever. I had made up my mind that at some
point I would kill myself rather than face an eternity of
anguish. I just hadn't yet decided when I was going to
finally and irrevocably abandon all hope. Is this the kind of
surrender that's necessary for psychological victory? Christ
said that you must give up your life to save it. Does this
spiritual concept carry an analogous psychological parallel?
It might. Because, for me, the virtual abandonment of hope
left space for something to grow.


Slowly and almost imperceptively, I began to feel better.
I cannot account for the change. It may have been the antidepressant
medication. Maybe it was some gain from psychotherapy.
Or it may be that I just wore my depression
down. The more likely answer is that it was the interaction
of all these things that made the difference. At any rate,
there was no burst of insight or blinding moment of revelation,
no sublime conversion, or any of the other magical
moments we hope for. It was just slow, grinding work.


I came to regard the pathology I was experiencing as really
not a part of me. (Of course, there are sound psychological
reasons why one would do this.) I came to see "it" as my
adversary. And a struggle began between "it" and "me" for
dominance of the person I had come to know as RH. This
tactical change in strategy (not consciously deliberate, I can
assure you) enabled me to use one facet of my character to
advantage--stubbornness. This kind of attitudinal shift
then made my personality liability of stubbornness into an

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I've said, there was not a sudden burst of psychological
insight, no glorious peak of experience, no sudden cataclysmic
freedom. One day I just had several moments of
calmness, of freedom from anxiety and despair. Then there
were even times when an incident seemed funny to me.
There were a few more moments when I dared hope that I
would live normally again. I was almost afraid to think
about it since my hopes had been crushed so often before.


A person who hasn't lived with continuous anxiety and
fear probably cannot fully appreciate what it means to have
a few moments of peace. It is so sweet. You guard those
moments alone, until you feel you have enough to share
them with someone else.


Then (this is included as information for the clinicians
among you), I began to sleep a little better. And on occasion,
I even enjoyed something I ate. I started slowly to gain back
a little of the twenty-five or so pounds I had lost. I began
to think a little of my schooling and to plan on going back
to work on my dissertation. I also worried about acceptance
or rejection when I asked to be readmitted to candidacy at
the university. I started to see my wife, Nancy, as an attractive
and desirable woman again instead of as a shoulder to
cry on or as a symbol of silent reproach.


All of this came slowly. I was almost afraid to tell Nancy
that I felt better. I was fearful that it wouldn't last. But I was
better, and I felt better. Soon I started to plan on leaving the
hospital; I would go part-time at first and then forever, I
hoped. Finally, I did leave, in mortal fear that I might have
to return. I was very shaky, unsure of myself and quite
irritable and nasty. I went home with my wife one afternoon
with my heart in my mouth. Since that day, we have
struggled together.
