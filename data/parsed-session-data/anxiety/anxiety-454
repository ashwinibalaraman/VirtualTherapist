BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So how ya doin?
<b>PT:</b> Good.  How're you doin?
<b>DR:</b> Good, good.
<b>PT:</b> Good.
<b>DR:</b> How's school?
<b>PT:</b> Um, it's all right, it's kinda hard this semester but.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Tough load or?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah. 
CG: Lot of upper division classes so -
<b>DR:</b> Oh. So, you're more than half way through this semester though right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, kinda like five weeks left.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good. 
<b>PT:</b> Graduation, so. 
<b>DR:</b> That's amazing.
<b>PT:</b> I know, it's flying by.
<b>DR:</b> And do you know what you're doing next year yet?
<b>PT:</b> Not really actually um, you know I get - I don't remember the last time we met, it might have been last summer.
<b>DR:</b> It was uh let's see, it was last July yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> It's been almost a year.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's been a while so, I don't know, I took the MCAT  last August, I didn't do that well on it, I didn't really prepare as well as I should of.  I don't know lately I've been wondering if going into medicine is really for me or not.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm trying to weigh all my options.
<b>DR:</b> That's always wise.  Did you go ahead and apply to schools or not?
<b>PT:</b> Uh not yet, no.
<b>DR:</b> So when would you need to apply by?  Let's see do you graduate this year, [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah I would have had to apply you know like a month ago, so.
<b>DR:</b> Oh okay.
<b>PT:</b> I'm just probably gonna take a year to kinda try and figure out what I want to do and apply for the following fall.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Did you not apply just because you were unhappy with your MCAT scores or you just weren't sure if you wanted to go into medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah a little bit of both.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And, I just - I, I think I've just kinda been zoned in on going into that kinda my whole, I don't know college career and I've never really, you know, looked at other options.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like it's kinda important to do that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it's always good to keep your options open.
<b>PT:</b> Kinda my trad - the traditionalist background of my parents kinda.  They wanted to be something at a given age and they just kinda went for it and that's what they are you know.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> That's much less common today than it was at that time.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> So any ideas of one of the things you might do?
<b>PT:</b> Um, really maybe uh something in sports medicine like - 
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> This internship I've been doing with the sports medicine program at [DEIDENTIFIED] has been pretty cool.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I got to work with the football team last fall and I got to work with the track team in the spring.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I just like being around athletes and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I'd like to go into athletic training but it's kinda hard 'cause you'd have to, I'd have to go into an entry level graduate program and there's only like thirteen in the whole country so.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, so none of them are in this state.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> And wouldn't really want to pursue another undergraduate degree in just that and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> There's other things I could go into, maybe physical therapy or uh physician's assistant even or something like that.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just kinda need to, kinda look at what's out there I guess. Maybe even a graduate program in nutrition or something.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.  Well what, what are your grades overall, do you know?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Do you know what about your G P A is?
<b>PT:</b> It's uh three seven.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, that's very good.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and when you say you didn't do as good as you'd hoped on the MCATs, like how did ya do?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty bad actually, I got a twenty I think.
<b>DR:</b> Well I don't know how they score now, what's the, twenty out of what?
<b>PT:</b> I think it's a forty something.
<b>DR:</b> So mid-range. That may not be that bad cause you gotta think about the fact that at least when I went to school you know, some of the people that are taking those MCATs like one of roommates in medical school is a radiologist now -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Was an English major.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So you know he took the bare bones um science courses and just sorta scraped by.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So there are a lot of people who go to medical school that aren't you know ninety ninth percentile people on the standardized tests.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> In fact it's the, you don't know, the way they used to determine the admissions was they'd have a formula, the G P A and MCAT scores were part of it but they were just a small part of whether you got accepted or not.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> They looked at your life experience - have you done internships, other things.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> So, I don't want to push you into it, I just want you to not feel like you couldn't get in because your MCAT scores weren't that high.
<b>PT:</b> Right, right.
<b>DR:</b> A lot of people think that and it's really not that crucial.
<b>PT:</b> I guess too, just being around my dad and, I just, some parts of his lifestyle has been so stressful that -
<b>DR:</b> I understand.
<b>PT:</b> But that's kind of a biased opinion just being around one [DEIDENTIFIED] my whole life.
<b>DR:</b> It is, I mean there certainly is stress, I think the keys is to figure out what's gonna work for you -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I hope you don't shut down options, you know, for yourself, just because, who knows you may end up trying something and not liking it, you may try something else, really love it cause it sounds like the athletic training stuff  you really enjoy.
<b>PT:</b> For sure and part of it is just the whole way I deal with stress,  I feel like um I'm glad I saw this last week on TV it was just a real quick word I saw on C N N about this woman who was a resident, I think and she'd come home at night from her eighty hour week and wonder if she gave that person the right medication, did I do this correct, did I do that right.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like I do that just with the responsibilities I have that aren't even, you know in regards to a person's life, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like I drive myself kinda crazy sometimes.
<b>DR:</b> Just worrying about things.
<b>PT:</b> About responsibility.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> 'Cause that's just, I don't know, that's kinda what I've noticed um, cause I haven't been taking medication since probably, I don't know since my last prescription ran out, or maybe the prescription after that. I think it's been since -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah I wrote that last prescription for ninety, for a month's worth of five refills pills in July, so it would have been six months' worth, so do you think you stopped like in January maybe or something?
<b>PT:</b> Um, actually I think I started to stop before that, I think in December or November actually. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> And have you noticed any difference in how you feel since you stopped it?
<b>PT:</b> Um, a little, I, I, felt like I was just too like I don't know in the middle, like I wasn't really getting that excited about anything, but I also wasn't getting sad, I was kinda -
<b>DR:</b> Kinda flat?
<b>PT:</b> Flat emotionally, but obviously since I've been off of it, I still felt that way kind of.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Like I was hopin' this spring break you know I'd be able to get a little more excited about things and -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I mean I had, I felt like I had a good time, my family was in town and I was able to kinda be laid back a little bit more, but I still felt kind of, I always feel like I'm just a little too anxious and I just can't quite relax or I feel like there's always something I need to do or -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> There's something I'm always beating myself up about.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I feel like it's almost a little more diffuse, kind of always there, I'm actually in an abnormal psych class right now too.
<b>DR:</b> Oh those were tough.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause you can diagnose yourself most of us do at least.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I know.  Right and I just remember when we went over dysthymia which is like over a long period of time, it's kinda always there but it's milder.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I almost feel like sometimes that's how I feel but, just cause I'm not like severely depressed or anything but I'm always just kind  of beatin myself up about stuff and -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> It can just be the littlest things like, I even wrote down a couple of things, just to kinda -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Keep in mind.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> See what I did with it. I don't know just for instance like just yesterday I realized I didn't bring my textbook home.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm still on spring break, it's not like I need to be studying, I don't have a test tomorrow or anything but.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know for a good half a day I was like beatin myself up for it and I couldn't let it go and.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Makin myself feel bad because I didn't bring this book home and -
<b>DR:</b> Hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's not like I didn't intentionally didn't bring it or anything, it just happened that I wasn't in [DEIDENTIFIED] to get it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Or um, I had to work a few days last week I was doing [DEIDENTIFIED] up at [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I just, I couldn't come home from the day and really fully relax because I was always worrying about having to go to work the next day and um almost making the job more stressful than I needed to make it, ya know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just thinking about work when I'm not even there.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Kinda deal and when I coulda just been trying to relax with my family a little bit more.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I, and I remember too right before I had this - I had two big tests on Friday right before spring break and Thursday morning I had a couple classes, but one conflicted with uh my professor's office hours and I felt like it would be more work by the time to go to his office hours for this test coming up.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> But then that afternoon I kept beatin myself up and even in that meeting time when I should have been taking in information for my test I was kicking myself for not going to class that morning.
<b>DR:</b> Huh.
<b>PT:</b> It's not like I miss class all the time and I missed it I felt for a good reason.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Looking back on it, but it's things like that and it's stuff that I shouldn't be getting down on myself for that I am getting down on myself for.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it sounds like you're pretty hard on yourself still.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. What about, are you sleeping okay at night?  Are you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I feel like I'm sleeping okay.  I guess just falling asleep is kinda hard.  I, I've had problems falling asleep sometimes when I'm stressed out just cause I can't like turn my mind off,  you know.
<b>DR:</b> How long does it take you to fall asleep after you turn the lights off?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't know, it kinda varies, probably sometimes it takes, you know just ten, fifteen minutes maybe.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But other times it can take like a half hour or so.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Or maybe even longer.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Especially if I have something big coming up like a test or something.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and during the day is your energy level pretty good or do you feel tired?
<b>PT:</b> It's not bad, I, I don't know I feel like I've just been kinda overwhelmed this semester, kinda over my head with commitments.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Looks like I've gotten committed to too many things, 'cause I have school and then my internship.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And then I also work at the [DEIDENTIFIED] some.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Not a lot of hours but it's still a commitment that I'm responsible for.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> I do some - I have a personal training client and I work upstairs in the office like where the aerobic classes get checked in and stuff.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And it's just these different commitments in different areas.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And it just can be kinda overwhelming at times and -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't get to the gym as much as I did last semester at least.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I don't feel like I'm really like that out of shape.  I still, I don't know, maybe I'm just too hard on myself and I have a lot of commitments and it's just not a clear priority or something. 
<b>DR:</b> Okay, what about your appetite, you eatin?
<b>PT:</b> Eatin's fine.
<b>DR:</b> Pretty normal?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I've actually noticed that I don't have as many G I problems as I used to.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if that's just my body's become used to it. Maybe I've been watching my diet and I don't really notice that I am.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Much, you know eating healthier foods or not so much of like dairy or not so much like a bunch of you know, enriched wheat products or something, maybe that's what helping, but.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, [PATIENT NAME] do you feel like you're able to concentrate pretty well or do he worries and anxieties get in the way?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I usually can concentrate pretty well, you know, I kinda have a little senioritis spring fever.  I do think that's kinda normal, I was talking to my peers.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like that's more what gets me distracted than anything else.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Is that I'm just kinda burned out.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> So.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  And you said kinda mild depression, do you ever get to the point of feelin severely depressed like having suicidal thoughts?
<b>PT:</b> Um no.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I guess sometimes when I'm really stressed out I feel kinda, I almost feel guilty for feeling guilty, like why am I um wishing this week away, I just want this week to be over you know, I just wanna to sleep forever, I don't wanna to do all this work and I don't know, I guess that might be kinda normal but -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah. 
<b>PT:</b> I kinda wish I could take the best out of each day instead of wishing it away so I get to my get my test over with or whatever, but -
<b>DR:</b> Sure. Well let me ask you this, I'm thinking, it's sounds like there - the anxiety is still present and the depression is not real severe, like you said it's kinda mild, low levels sorta takes some of the enjoyment out of life.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I mean I think there are a couple of different approaches, one would be to try a different medicine if you wanted to or a second would be to try to talk with a counselor to try to get some cognitive therapy for you to start changing those self-critical thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I feel like therapy might be beneficial for me too, just 'cause I feel like I get a lot out of talking to somebody that's -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Kind of got an objective view versus talking with my parents or my sister or something -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it really -
<b>PT:</b> Tells me don't stress or don't, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right. Yeah, therapy definitely is different. I mean it helps to have the support from family but it's not the same as therapy. Therapy can really help us work to change our thoughts.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, do you know, there's a counseling center probably in [DEIDENTIFIED], do you know?  I mean at the university I assume?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, through [DEIDENTIFIED] there's counseling.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, I'm thinking, I don't know anybody in [DEIDENTIFIED] to recommend so you could go to the student health center and just you know talk to someone there and say I'd like to see a counselor just to talk about some issues probably hook you up with someone.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  I remember talking with one before I even came and met with you in fact, probably a year or two ago.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> And I think they let us have six sessions or something without even billing -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Anybody and I think I used three or four so -
<b>DR:</b> You might still have some sessions left.
<b>PT:</b> I probably have a couple left.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> At least to use maybe just part of the semester's and then after that I could go somewhere else.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah and it might even, I'm even thinking that sometimes they'll fix per year or something too so you might even have six more sessions.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So it's certainly something you could check into.  Um, what else um.
<b>PT:</b> I guess the biggest thing, I guess if the medication was to - I don't know cause I've been off of it I haven't felt like really worse, I think I've just been stressed out with school.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> So there's a couple possibilities, maybe the medicine wasn't working or doing anything for you.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum. Yeah maybe it was the particular kind.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Could be that medicine just wasn't, Paxil, wasn't the right one for you.  If you said you want to try some other medicine, there are some different kinds of medicines we could try that -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Might work well.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe something that will keep my energy level, is there anything that boosts it a little bit?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, there's one that might.  There's one called Effexor.  Have you heard of Effexor?
<b>PT:</b> Hum-um.
<b>DR:</b> It's been around a long time, um, in the early days it was a pain 'cause you usually had to take it more than once a day but now they've come out with an extended release that's once a day, it's a lot easier.  Um, the Paxil and Lexapro you were taking before increases a chemical called serotonin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Effexor does also, but it also increases another chemical called norepinephrines, which is kinda like adrenalin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.5
<b>DR:</b> And the advantages of that for some people are that it tends to be a little more energizing.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So people get a little kinda of a boost out of it and they have a little more get up and go but it still helps with depression and anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, it's a good medicine.  There's only one drawback to it that I'll mention to you and that is sometimes when people stop it, especially if they go cold turkey or they've been on it a while and they miss a day, they feel kinda off for a day until they take their medicine again.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And it can be kind of a dizziness for some people, like things are moving a little bit, that's the most common one.  So that in your head it feels like things move a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Um.
<b>PT:</b> I noticed that a little too when I got off mine, my last medication it's like dizzy spells or -
<b>DR:</b> It can happen, usually pretty -
<b>PT:</b> It went away like after a week.
<b>DR:</b> I was gonna say usually within a week or two they're gone so it's not bad and if they're too bad there's some things we can do actually to minimize it too, so it's not the end of the world, but it's just something I always try and make people aware of just so - and again if you've been on it for a while and you miss a dose you feel kinda crummy you actually say did I forget my medicine that day and if you did just go take it and within an hour or so that usually goes away.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So, but it's a real good medicine.  It's not addictive.  It's safe um, uh and in the early days again it caused some nausea, with this extended release formula that almost never happens anymore.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Um, does it sound like something you want to try and see if it would help?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I might want to.  Is there anyway maybe like I could call in, you could call in a prescription maybe?
<b>DR:</b> I could even give you some samples if you want -
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just to start it and see what you think.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Let's see we've got some directions too.  I've got like a three week supply here.  So these are, this is a sample pack to start you've got 37.5 and 75 mg  capsules.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> What you do is you take one 37.5 each day for a week, then one 75 each day for a week and then two of the 75s each day so we'll get you up to 150 which is sort of an average dose.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> We can go higher than that we could but we usually go to 150 and kinda stay there and see if that's working.  Let me get you those first.  I'll write these directions down.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And don't be discouraged if you don't feel anything right away, usually with the lower doses people don't notice a lot. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> For most people it starts to kick in when you get up around 150, occasionally at 75 people feel a little bit of improvement.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> But we have to build up slowly to avoid nausea or any of those side effects.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Most people take it in the morning 'cause it can be kind of energizing.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.  I just know like some people in my family take uh Prozac.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know, I don't know what your take is on that?
<b>DR:</b> You know it's a good one for some people too.  The problem with all these medicines is there's not any one that stands out that's better than the others. They're all pretty much equally effective, but for some people one might be a lot better than the others.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Um, Prozac works well for a lot of people.  Some people do get some energy with it, other people can feel kinda tired when they take it, so it can go either way.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> The other thing with Prozac is it stays in your system a long time like when you stop taking it, it'll still be in your system for weeks. 
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> So that's not a problem for most people, but [INAUDIBLE] a side effect it can be kind of annoying.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So, it's actually the one, Prozac is what we often use if people have withdrawal systems from stopping Effexor when they get that dizzy stuff.
<b>PT:</b> Um- hum.
<b>DR:</b> If you take Prozac it usually prevents that kind of problem.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Like if you were to forget to take it or something?
<b>DR:</b> Well if you forget to take it, it's better to take an Effexor, but if you want to stop it, then we taper you off of it and if you have some dizzy spells anyway then we put people on Prozac for a week or two and it stops the dizzy spells and - then you don't have to take a Prozac either.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So there are the directions again, 37.5 a day, then 75 and then 150 and if it's working and you want to stick with it, I can call in a prescription or I can just give you a prescription now, whichever you prefer.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Uh.
<b>DR:</b> Do you want me to give you one now or do you want to call me and let me know how it's working?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah maybe I'll do that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah why don't you give me a call, like within you know about two and a half three weeks when you're maybe getting down to the last of the 150 and let me know if it's working, great, I'll call you in a prescription, if it's not working so well we have a couple options we can go higher on the dose -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Or if you don't like it we can stop it, get ya off of it.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Does that sound all right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and if it doesn't work then we can always try something else.  Prozac would be another one we could try, you know sometimes family members respond similarly, not always.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, there are a bunch of others we can try too, I mean there's a couple dozen, more than a couple dozen different medicines and sometimes just trial and error until we find the right one that works for a person.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, so it's worth it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> You know to keep trying until we find something that's gonna give you some help.  Then I'd try the counseling too just cause I think it might help change some of those thought patterns. I know when I first got into counseling, I was goin - I was in my residency and I was amazed how things just started feeling different and going differently just by talking to someone, you know.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> It really kinda shifted the way I perceived things and thought about things and some of the same stuff, critical thoughts I had that you described.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Suddenly they just started fading away and just made life a lot easier.
<b>PT:</b> That's good, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So.
<b>PT:</b> I guess sometimes I just feel like I'm just kinda like the only one like no one else is feeling this way.
<b>DR:</b> Believe me you're not alone with this one, I mean, I've had that same thing, a lot of people do, especially people that tend to be pretty high achievers.  I mean there are books written about it, it's called the Inner Critic, this part of us that beats up on us this hard.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like kinda overlying thing is I just kinda tend to obsess on things and not letting go.
<b>DR:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b> If I'm not beatin myself up for you know not going to a class or forgetting a book or -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Work or whatever it might be, I'll beat myself up for a thought that I'm having you know.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It's like that's kinda, there's always something there that I feel I can beat myself up for and that's just - it's not, it's not a good thing to do.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Ya know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I mean, it's not necessary.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> There are easier ways to be successful in life than beatin ourselves up all the time.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And I think the key is to find a balance where how do you remind yourself of the things you need to do without being hard on yourself.
<b>PT:</b> And I feel like the intrusive thoughts, like they're not, I guess they're not as bad like as much, but -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> They're still get kinda - they're still kinda there.
<b>DR:</b> Still there at times.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and more sometimes when I see a visual or something or.
<b>DR:</b> Okay and again if those are annoying or become more problematic there are other things we can do.  Sometimes this medicine will help.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And if it doesn't there are other kinds of medicines that sometimes help block out intrusive thoughts. 
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> And again, you're not alone with that either, there are a lot of people who get intrusive thoughts -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And that's really frustrating to people who do, but there are ways to kinda help block those out, again counseling can help, the medicines can help too.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So let's give this a try as our first step.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And like I said, if you'll just give me a call sometime in the next, probably between two and three weeks, let me know how it's going, or sooner if you have any questions.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And we'll kind of adjust as we go.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then maybe we can check in, I don't know if you're down here in the next month or two you can give me a call we can check in, if not maybe we can.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'll probably come down during - 'cause school will be out in May, early May.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So I'll probably be able to come down after I graduate sometime
<b>DR:</b> Sure, yeah, let me know whatever works for you, we'll set the time and check in and see how this is working, if it's working we'll stick with it, if not we'll come up with other options.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Good, anything else today you wanted to talk about?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so, I just I don't know, I guess I feel like there's this time when it might be a little bit just like, and all of a sudden I'm gonna forget about it or something, but -
<b>DR:</b> Forget about what?
<b>PT:</b> Just forget about like, the certain thoughts that I have.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> The ones that I beat myself up about and -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know our thoughts tend to be habitual.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And so if we get into a certain thought pattern we tend to continue with that thought pattern unless we do something to change it.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And that's where again sometimes the medicine and counseling will change our thought patterns, but if we don't do anything to change them, they often just keep going 'cause that's the habit that our brain's gotten into.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> So I think the key is to find some way to change that habitual thought pattern.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And I think the medicines hopefully will help. I think the counseling could help.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And uh, I guess depending on, I'm just thinking too depending on where you're gonna be over the summer. Are you planning to move back in the spring? You gonna stay in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> I'm gonna stay in [DEIDENTIFIED] this summer but -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> After that I really don't know.  I was even talking to my cousin about maybe living with her out in [DEIDENTIFIED] for a little while.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Just to kinda get a new, I don't know perspective.
<b>DR:</b> Sure.
<b>PT:</b> Get out of [DEIDENTIFIED] for a little while.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah sometimes it's nice just to get a different viewpoint so, well we'll kinda play it by ear then so you know once you know what you're plans are, but for now let's just try this for the next couple months and -
<b>PT:</b> Okay
<b>DR:</b> And see how you're doing okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay sounds good.
<b>DR:</b> All right [PATIENT NAME] and again, if you have any questions please call me, okay?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> I want to make sure things go well for you, if it's not working it, we can adjust it so it won't cause any problems, all right?
<b>PT:</b> Okay, cool.
<b>DR:</b> All right well good luck with finals and -
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> Anything else you've got goin on.  Sure. 
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> Good seein you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah you too.
