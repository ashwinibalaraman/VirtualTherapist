THIS RECORD has thus far sought to present a simple, factual
account. It has told the story of my life with a minimum of
reflection and interpretation. There must therefore be a number
of questions in the mind of anyone who has read the narrative
carefully. Some of these questions call for consideration.


THE BASIC CONFLICT


The first of these questions will probably have to do with the
basis of the conflict, the sexual hypersensitivity which caused
me so much agony in the adolescent period. I thought of myself
as having a “diseased mind” and of being a “wretch in direst
need.” Did I not perhaps exaggerate the trouble and work myself
up into a morbid condition over something which was not so
bad after all? Was not the sense of guilt a “needless and harmful
intruder,” to use Dr. Fosdick's phrase? <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_1065');">[note]</a><div id="_note_1065" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1<i>On Being a Real Person</i> (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1943), p. 150.</div> Was not a “measure of
intelligent common sense about a small prohibitory detail” all
that was needed? I have often wanted to think so. Nevertheless,
it remains true that until the decision to study forestry and until
Alice Batchelder came into my life, I was fighting a losing battle
on a crucially important front. I was a really sick person. I

The present-day tendency to seek the solution of a troublesome
sex drive by lowering the conscience threshold and looking
upon sex as a natural desire to be lightly satisfied is something
which seems to me to be a serious mistake. Such a solution takes
little account of the principle which Professor Hocking sets
forth so finely, that sex love, insofar as it finds its true meaning,
approaches identity with religion. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_2321');">[note]</a><div id="_note_2321" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;"><i>2 Human Nature and Its Re-making</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press,
1923), chap. 42.</div> It seeks somewhat the same
thing, viz., union with the idealized other-than-self, and the
health and meaning of love depend upon the common devotion
to a common divinity.


From the biological standpoint it is to be borne in mind that
the sex drive has to do with the perpetuation and improvement
of the race. Since it is for this that the individual exists, and
since in man the sex drive is not controlled physiologically, as
in the lower animals, but by means of the “mores,” the conscience,
it is hardly to be wondered at that its control gives rise to difficult
problems. Their solution is surely not to be found in easy
self-indulgence, at least for those who are concerned with the
realization of the personal and social potentialities that ought to
be. For my own part, as I look back over the past, I have no
regret for the anxiety and distress of mind which I suffered in
those early years, but only for my stupidity and failure to learn
the elements of self-discipline.


But does not such a view impose a terrible burden upon the
adolescent and upon those who are responsible for his upbringing?

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My own experience may serve to call attention to the futility
of merely imparting information in that which concerns sex
education. The books which gave me trouble in my adolescent
period were for the most part good books; but they supplied more
information than I was able to handle at the time. It should
be very clear that sex education is not a matter of instruction,
but of psychotherapy. It is dependent not so much upon what
the teacher says to the boy as upon what the boy is able to say
to the teacher.


THE PASSAGES OF SCRIPTURE


Another question which may be raised has to do with the
opening of the Bible and looking for guidance in the words
upon which my eye happened to fall (see pp. 53-55). In one
of my interviews with Dr. Elwood Worcester at the time I was
leaving Westboro, I made an apologetic reference to the fact
that I had done that. He rebuked me sharply. This was not just
superstition, he said. While he would never encourage anyone to
employ such a device, it was in his judgment a well-established
fact that communications were sometimes received in this way.


I would not for a minute defend this as a practice. At the same
time, I still believe that something more than coincidence was
here involved. Those passages of Scripture and the other messages
bore with amazing directness upon the questions uppermost
in my mind. I am very sure that if I had started out to look

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Worcester, it should be said, was a convinced believer in
psychic phenomena and a leader in the field of psychic research.
I have myself long held the view that the religious
<i>Weltanschauung</i> presupposes the survival of the personality
and the existence of an organized spiritual world superior to our
own. What I have questioned is the attempt to communicate
with various discarnate spirits. My visits to a number of seances
have impressed me with the fact that their procedures and beliefs,
and the atmosphere which pervades them, make for a disorganized
universe. For this reason I have looked upon them as
unwholesome, except for the trained investigator, and I have
deliberately avoided them. It is in my judgment of the essence
of Christianity that prayer is directed to God “in the name of
Christ,” thus making for a centralized universe.


I am profoundly convinced of the purposive nature of the
searching experiences through which I have passed. I am
equally convinced that there is involved something more than
blind striving, or <i>élan vitale</i>. For these beliefs my own experience
furnishes evidence to me. I can hardly expect it to do so
for others.


THE ACUTE EPISODES


A review of this record will show that I have passed through
five psychotic episodes during which my thinking has been irrational
in the extreme and my condition was such as to warrant
the classification of “schizophrenic reaction, catatonic type.”
By that is meant that in sharp contrast to those forms of schizophrenia

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In addition to these five psychotic episodes there have been
five major decisions which have been marked by deviation from
the normal (see pp. 45-47, 50, 55, 56, 74-75).


All ten of these abnormal experiences began under the precise
conditions which, for me at least, have characterized creative
mental activity. There was intense interest in an important problem,
There was also marked narrowing of attention, and prayer
carried to the point of absorption. Such conditions are fertile
in new ideas, but the creativity is obtained at the expense of
structured experience. Perspective may be lost and wide limits
set for the validity of inner promptings. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_9031');">[note]</a><div id="_note_9031" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4 Henri Delacroix, <i>op, cit</i>., pp. 376 ff.</div> There is likely to be
a radical change in the concept of the self, marked frequently
by the sense of mystical identification, which leads some psychiatrists
to explain such experiences in terms of “weak ego
structure.”


The beginning of the abnormal experience, regardless of its
severity, and its most distinguishing characteristic, is to be found
in what Professor Coe has called the “automatism.” By this he
meant the idea, or thought structure, which after a period of
incubation <i>in the</i> region of dim awareness, leaps suddenly into

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This abdication of reason before the authority of the automatism
is, then, distinctive of the abnormal condition, especially
in its acute forms. A better way to express it might be to say that
critical judgment, though never absent, ascribes undue validity
to the automatism, or insight, and feeling displaces reason and
common sense. The unseen world of fantasy and feeling becomes
the supposedly real world.


The automatism, as a psychological process, is found not only
in the experience of schizophrenics. It is to be found also in the
creative activities of poets and inventors and scientists. It is the
mechanism involved in spiritistic phenomena.


It follows, therefore, that in the automatisms which characterize
acute schizophrenic episodes, in those which may accompany
the making of important decisions, and in those of poets, inventors,
scientists, and religious leaders, we have a continuum

SENSE IN THE NONSENSE


Dr. Adolph Meyer has said that he could listen with as much
respect to the ideas of an excited schizophrenic as he could to
those of an Oriental philosopher, because he knew that those
ideas had meaning, and his job as a psychiatrist was to discover
the sense in the nonsense.


As I look back upon the strange ideas which came flooding
into my mind during the disturbed periods, I keep that principle
in mind. But what an array of ideas and how bizarre and utterly
meaningless some of them seem!


In any attempt at interpretation it should be noted that some
of these ideas are characteristic of acute schizophrenia generally.
Ideas of self-sacrifice, of death, of world disaster, of mystical
identification, of rebirth, of reincarnation, of prophetic mission
are to be found not only in my case but in other acutely disturbed
schizophrenics also. As I have shown elsewhere, <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13076');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13076" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6<i> Exploration of the Inner World</i>, chap, i; “The Form and Content of
Schizophrenic Thinking,” <i>Psychiatry</i>, V: 1 (February 1942), 23-33; “Onset
in Acute Schizophrenia,” <i>Psychiatry</i>, X: 2 (May, 1947), 159-66; “Mystical
Identification in Mental Disorder,” <i>Psychiatry</i>, XV: 3 (August, 1952), 287-96.</div> such ideas seem
to form a sort of constellation which is distinctive of acute schizophrenia.
Where we find one of these ideas we are likely to find
the others also. Such ideas do have meaning. Their basis may
be found in the structure of the human psyche and in the constructive
aspects of the schizophrenic experience. The idea of
self-sacrifice and death, which is most frequent in schizophrenic
thinking, represents quite accurately the loss or renunciation of
something of supreme value, with which schizophrenic disturbances

[p. <i>205</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These ideas symbolize the meaning of the acute schizophrenic
experience in its typical, or generic manifestations, and the predominance
of such ideas, when free from malignant tendencies
such as suspicion, hostility, faultfinding, self-deception, wishful
thinking, and eroticism, means usually that the healing forces are
in operation, that hidden things are being brought to light, and
that the sufferer is striving desperately to face what for him is
ultimate Reality.


Thus interpreted, an acute schizophrenic episode assumes the
character of religious experience. It becomes an attempt at
thoroughgoing reorganization, beginning at the very center of
one's being, an attempt which tends either to make or break the
personality.


In addition to these generic ideas there were some which
were peculiar to my own case, ideas which I have not encountered
elsewhere either in my reading or in other cases with
which I have dealt. Among these are the “theory of types” (see
p. 105), that of “life in two cycles” (see p. 106), the idea of
“levels of existence” (see p. 93), and the “family-of-four” (see
p. 82). In most of these I see no special meaning. I am inclined
to regard them as due to the play of fantasy when the mind is
stirred by strong emotion at its deeper levels.

[p. <i>206</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of these ideas, however, has puzzled me not a little. I refer
to that of the family-of-four. This idea sprang full-fledged
into my mind just at the time when I seemed about to attain that
for which I had been striving over seventeen long years. It
called for a renunciation of that hope, and it recurred insistently
in each one of the subsequent psychotic episodes. It really seemed
as though some deeper self were trying to impart some urgent
message. But when I sought to interpret it in accordance with
longings of my own, there arose a conflict which eventuated, in
the psychosis of 1930.


What specific meaning this idea had in the later episodes is
by no means clear, but for the earlier disturbance of 1920, the
situation in which I found myself offers a clue. It is to be borne
in mind that Alice was a professional religious worker, a representative
of the organization which, at the time I first knew
her, was in charge of about all the personal counseling which
was being done in our colleges. It is also to be recognized that I
was a really sick person who had come to her for help. This help
she at first refused but eventually granted. She tried, however,
to keep the relationship on a professional basis. She wrote to me
on her official stationery, and she corrected me sharply whenever
I assumed that anything beyond a professional relationship was
involved. But that assumption was there in her mind, too, I
think. She assumed that she would have to marry me to give the
needed help. But for her, marriage was to be thought of only
under certain conditions. I must first prove my manhood and
the devotion I professed. This I failed to do. As a woman of
integrity and courage she took that as her answer. At the same
time, there was an obligation which she recognized. I had entered
the ministry under conditions in which she was involved. She
therefore felt a certain responsibility for me.

[p. <i>207</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097987-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But from the beginning I had told her that it was her help
I needed and that I would never accept anything from her that
she could not give freely. I had even gone so far, during a brief
psychotic episode, as to try to give her to another man.


The idea of the family-of-four might then represent the feeling
deep down within me that there ought to be a way for her,
or for her prototype, to give the needed help without having to
sacrifice herself in a loveless marriage. And there ought to be
a way for me, or for my prototype, to receive such help without
having to undergo the frustration which I had suffered.


What was involved in this idea of the family-of-four would
then be somewhat like the Freudian concept of the “transference”
relationship, which had struck me so forcibly when I first
heard of it during my hospitalization at Westboro (see p. 104).
Freud had found that in cases of neurotic illness in which treatment
is effective, it is to be expected that the patient may become
attached to the physician and that this attachment may even go
so far as to become love. If this happens, it is not to be regarded
as a cause for embarrassment, but rather as a source of healing
which is to be accepted and utilized as part of the process of
treatment. It must then be resolved before the cure is complete.
There are difficulties in this interpretation, but of one thing at
least I am sure. My love for Alice Batchelder has been for me
a source of healing.


The family-of-four was of course a crazy idea and there may
or may not be sense in the nonsense, but in it and in the experience
out of which it sprang I see one principle which is
eternally true. I am thinking of the Freudian teaching that the
transference relationship must be satisfactorily resolved before
the cure is complete. I am thinking of the old Dante-Beatrice
story, in which the poet had to pass through the fire before he
