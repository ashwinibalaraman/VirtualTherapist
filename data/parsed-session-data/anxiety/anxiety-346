Some cases of anorexia nervosa are linked to child abuse. This abuse can range from severe mental or physical
torment, to bullying and neglect. Often this neglect or lack of love occurs in the first ten years of the person's life.
The way people are treated in their formative years can have a profound effect on them well into adulthood.
During these years our belief systems are formed and the way we view ourselves, our self-confidence and self-esteem
are established. Anorexia nervosa is not about dieting. Weight loss is only a symptom of a much larger
problem, which is why the media concept of anorexia as a ‘slimmer's disease’ inspired by thin models and actresses
is so misleading.


From the age of three I was abused by my grandmother, who systematically tried to destroy me. Constant, cruel
verbal taunts led me to believe that I was a bad person who didn't deserve anything good. I was a thin child but was
never aware of this because she told me ‘You're a fat, ugly child and will grow into a fat, ugly adult.’ As a child I was
locked into dark bedrooms. I was offered presents, and then told I couldn't have them because I wasn't worthy
enough. I was abandoned in shops for hours at a time.


My grandmother told me my parents would die if I spoke of the abuse, so I kept quiet. As I grew older and no
longer believed my grandmother could kill my parents I still remained silent because I now felt I deserved the
treatment I received. My grandmother's brainwashing was working. I felt I needed to be punished.


At the age of seventeen refusing to eat became the solution to my problems. The self-hatred was growing stronger
each day. I hated my body, I hated myself and I felt I had to disappear. If I shrank in size then everything would be
alright. To disappear I had to stop eating, which was fine because by now I didn't believe I even deserved food.


Like other people with anorexia I was being controlled by an inner voice that dictated my every move. This
voice told me I couldn't eat, shouting loudly and persistently: ‘You're a worthless, fat, ugly pig, disgusting, revolting
and hateful. Stop eating now.’ It was this all-powerful voice that kept me in a anorexic state, threatening that if I
confided in anyone about my illness, I would be locked in a hospital and force fed until I was huge. Anorexia
nervosa was my suicide by starvation. I was imprisoned in a nightmare world of terror, where food was the enemy.


I didn't consider that my own needs were important. I tried to look after everybody else and became especially
protective of my parents. I shielded Mum from my grandmother. If I accepted the abuse then Gran had her victim

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I also became the ultimate people pleaser. I desperately wanted to be loved but believed I was unlovable. My
grandmother had never loved me and she told me my parents hated me too. I therefore started to try to win
people's love by doing everything within my power to make them happy, until it became a way of life. I didn't feel
comfortable doing anything for myself; my life was lived for the sake of others.


I was seen as a convenient scapegoat, an emotional dumping ground for others. Whenever anyone felt bad
they would give me all their bad feelings and I accepted them. I didn't have enough self-worth to say that I was
being treated unfairly. My grandmother had conditioned me to believe I was the lowest of the low.


Over time I became secretive and withdrawn and afraid to be a burden to others. I was unable to talk about my
problems. My weight continued to drop and at the age of twenty-five I weighed only four stone ten pounds — a
horrifically low weight considering I was five feet eight inches tall. Just a few days away from death I was admitted
to intensive care. Six months later I was released from the eating disorders clinic weighing seven stone, but my
mind was still very sick. The issues that had caused me to develop anorexia had not been properly addressed. I
understood all the therapeutic theories but was like a well-versed recovery machine on emotional auto-pilot just
repeating what I thought the medical staff wanted to hear. I was never able to voice the inner pain I felt.


I did eventually start to recover when I met Simon (my fiancé) and was shown unconditional love. I could see
how much Simon loved me and by trusting him and listening to his voice rather than the abusive anorexic voice
I started to form a more realistic picture of my own worth. Simon has shown me I am a very special person,
beautiful inside and out. By accepting his love I have found the strength to talk about the abuse I received and
accept that I didn't deserve to be treated in that way.


I feel that in order to recover people with anorexia need to learn to trust someone who cares about them, be it
a relative, friend, partner or counsellor. They need to learn to talk honestly to this person about their anorexic
feelings and then listen to that voice rather than the anorexic voice. The anorexic voice wants to destroy; the
person who cares wants to heal.

Anna's journey is a formidable struggle to overcome not only anorexia nervosa
but the destruction in early childhood of budding self-esteem brought about by
physical and emotional abuse at the hands of a family member. A battle hard
fought and a struggle within, overcome in adulthood through the existence
without of a non-judgemental, loving, sustaining, nurturing, caring relationship
based on trust, listening and mutual respect.


Self-esteem or self-worth has received more attention than almost any other
concept as a barometer of adjustment and mental health. A child or adolescent's
assessment of his or her self-worth continues to be seen as a key contributor to
successful or unsuccessful coping.


In childhood a major factor influencing self-esteem is the primary carer's
attitude towards the child, and that covers parenting style.


Adolescence represents a time of tremendous change. In the transition of
adolescence the views of peers come to play an increasingly critical role. For
young people, it is body image satisfaction that links most highly with a general
sense of self-esteem.


Recent research is now able to tell us that self-esteem can follow different
patterns over the adolescent years. Some young people have consistently high
self-esteem, others show rising self-esteem between the ages of twelve and sixteen,
a third group show consistently low self-esteem and a fourth group show a decline
in self-esteem during adolescence. Self-esteem is multi-dimensional so it is
possible to have high levels in some areas and lower levels in others. It changes
over time and most importantly is affected by social context. A supportive long-term
relationship with a parent or a teacher will have far more influence on self-esteem
than a short-term intervention.


Child abuse has been recognised as a significant social problem since the
1950s. Child maltreatment can involve chronic, pervasive acts of neglect. Carers
fail to meet a child's physical, nutritional, medical, educational and emotional
needs. In emotional abuse there can be a pattern of a seemingly deliberate
destruction of self-worth and evolving personality. Emotional abuse is
characterised by its attritional assault on the very existence of the young person,
making him or her feel both responsible for and guilty about his or her own abuse
and, even more destructively, responsible for the safety and well being of others
important to him or her if he or she ‘tells’.


Abuse eats away at the very core of the child. Even if children encounter adults
or peers outside the home whom they may be able to trust, they are now driven by
fear and a sense of hopelessness, and so controlled by their abuser that they cannot
tell, in case they bring about the destruction of others. The child holds and bears
his or her secret behind closed doors. One possible consequence — as in Anna's
story — is the development of anorexia nervosa.

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In anorexia nervosa, body weight is maintained at a minimum of fifteen per
cent below the expected. Weight loss is self-induced by avoiding fattening foods
and may be induced by restricting intake, exercise, vomiting or purging. There is
a body image distortion evident as a dread of fatness. There is widespread
endocrine disorder, which in girls shows itself as having no periods. Diagnosis
for younger adolescents makes allowance for failure to gain weight at puberty and
for delay in the process of puberty. Although not essential to make the diagnosis,
social withdrawal, rigid self-control, obsessionality and perfectionism arc common.


Within anorexia nervosa it is usually possible to identify difficulties in the
areas of identity formation, independence, behavioural control and physical
growth, which are the essence of the teenage years. Anorexia nervosa has the
highest mortality of any adolescent disorder.


Most cases of anorexia nervosa occur in adolescents and young women, and,
as the media often reports, it is linked to the extreme pressure on young women to
conform to today's very thin role models of beauty. Underlying anorexia nervosa
is often an adolescent maturational crisis, a combination of individual and family
variables, leading almost inevitably to a crystallisation of the disorder. Research
has found that serious negative life events occurred in the year before onset in a
quarter of cases, but if such a life event had occurred this was more likely to be
followed by a recovery.


Many children who go on to develop eating disorders in adolescence are free
from neurotic traits and behavioural disturbance. They are often described as
having been compliant, ideal children with a strong sense of morality, concern
about the welfare of others and conscientiousness.


Chronicity is a marked feature of eating disorders. For the individual adolescent,
weight loss usually increases concern with fatness, whereas increasing hunger
usually increases the fear that loss of control may be catastrophic.


Anorexia nervosa arises out of a complex array of personal and family dynamics
and, as Anna rightly says, it is vital to restore physical health to the young person
but also that sustained physical healing remains a major treatment challenge.


Assessment and treatment of an adolescent with any disorder will only be
effective if engagement in a therapeutic alliance can take place. The best way to
ensure this is to understand not just the disorder, problem, difficulty or illness,
but to understand from the perspective of the young person his or her unmet
needs in all areas of his or her life. In turn this is enabling for him or her, hopefully
allowing an adolescent to safely voice his or her inner pain.


In sharing her journey of abuse, pain, turmoil, hopelessness and the reality of
anorexia nervosa, Anna shows us how important positive turning points can be
in allowing us to form trusting, sustaining, relationships in adulthood.

One day, asking for a gay man's account of mental illness
will be rather like asking for a Jewish or a red-headed
man's. In other words, sexuality will be deemed irrelevant,
unless sexual problems are central to the illness.


In my experience, that day is here, or should be. Depression, for instance, surely
feels the same whether you're gay or straight. Other issues, in particular access to
specialists and specialist services affecting all users, are far more pressing concerns.


I'm thirty-six years old. At the age of fourteen and again at nineteen, I suffered
considerable anxiety and depression, and attempted suicide. I wound up in hospital
both times, first in London and then Oxford. Similar problems, plus some bizarre
somatising (sickness and dizziness in my own house), recommenced around the age
of twenty-nine. Some of these problems continue to this day, though no more suicide
attempts. I have been in psychological therapy of one sort or another for most of the
past six years, both in San Francisco and London. I was on antidepressant medication
from 1994 to 1996, and have been again from 1998 to today.


At fourteen I was told to attend weekly psychotherapy (no medication) at the London
hospital I ended up in. The therapist was male. I have to admit that, over time, I notice
that the gender of therapists seems to matter to me. I do better with men. Yet I've always
preferred female GPs. The therapy worked fast — within three months or so we stopped
meeting. Sexuality was glossed over; I don't remember it being mentioned. I already
more or less knew I was gay and, perhaps unusually, was not particularly perturbed
about it. I was, however, having problems adapting to a new, single-sex school, and
maybe sexuality was an underlying issue. Perhaps it still is, but it doesn't feel like it.


At nineteen, in Oxford, I was discharged from hospital with the offer of
psychological help, which I did not take up. (No medication.) As regards to sexuality,
university life was liberal. By then I was openly gay, and all my friends (and my family,
although it was not discussed) knew I was gay. In fact I very much enjoyed this openness.
The depression, or whatever it was, was to do with acute fear (of what, I still don't really
know), not sexual confusion. Over the years this fear/anxiety has been a persistent <i>basso
continuo</i>. Interestingly, it presents itself virtually identically in my (heterosexual) father.


On arrival in the USA, things went wrong very fast. Within days I was extremely
anxious, terrified. I felt I'd run to the edge of the world and had ended up hanging by
my fingertips from a crumbling cliff-edge. My GP referred me to a psychiatrist. Access
was almost instantaneous. Within a few days I was seeing him twice a week, fifty
minutes per session. As I believe all psychiatrists do over there, he handled both
and medication. The bizarre division in the NHS between hospital-psychotherapy
based psychiatrists who recommend but cannot prescribe and GPs who prescribe did
not exist. Meanwhile, I was at liberty to look for another clinical psychologist and/or

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In San Francisco there were of course plenty of specialist units and individuals for treating gay
people, including many openly gay professionals. I tested the waters but didn't like them. Like
many gay men, I don't want to be ghettoised. I want treatment that makes sense in the real world,
where I live, and whose standards match up to those of the real world too. Also like many gay men,
I'm hypercritical of other gay men, vestigial homophobia perhaps. Moreover, I simply don't want to
know anything about the private life of my health worker. Least of all his sex life. Of course, I
wouldn't want to feel that my sexuality was disapproved of, but I have never felt this in either
country, at least not from male professionals. I'm increasingly convinced that men are significantly
different from women, but that gay men are not a lot different from straight ones. And the patient/
professional relationship is a personal thing, the ‘fit’ depending on a host of issues, of which
sexuality is way down the list.


In the USA things stabilised fairly quickly, medication being primordial in this initial stage.
Various antidepressants were pretty expertly assayed then settled on and, in the first months,
anxiolitics undoubtedly saved me from losing my job, which my boss had threatened if I didn't
shape up in two weeks. Over time, the importance of this aspect of treatment declined; the
psychotherapeutic side took over. I saw the psychiatrist for well over two years, initially twice weekly
then once a week, fifty minutes per session.


I returned to England in good form. However, a year or so later, a fairly sudden crash caught the
UK system on the hop, to say the least. My GP is kind and has a good reputation, but saw in me a
problem that, she admitted, she felt insufficiently expert to cope with. To force me into specialist
care she told me to present to casualty. Few experiences can be more appalling than a NHS hospital
A&E; department when you feel your world is falling to bits. For various reasons, among which a
quite astonishing lack of empathy from the duty psychiatrists, this happened more than once. A
period that I don't want to recall of bewildering attempts to gain real help from a system that
seemed impenetrable or incomprehensible at worst, and random at best, ensued. Among other
surprises, I was twice told by different doctors (once my GP, once a hospital doctor) that I needed
help; the latter suggested three times a week, but that I would have to pay for it as resources simply
weren't available. (Sitting on an NHS waiting-list to be told at the end of it that you need help that
can't be provided by the NHS is distressing to say the least.) At one point I started seeing one of

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A melée of other meetings around this time showed me that, in comparison with my previous
US experience, funding, choice and access are not the only differences, although they are the crucial
ones. Among the other differences, I'd highlight a much more conservative approach to medication
in Britain, which may or may not be a good thing. There is also a surprising amount of labelling, of
working in therapeutic ‘boxes’, here. Almost everyone I've seen announces that they're ‘analytical’,
or ‘behavioural’, or ‘cognitive behavioural’, or whatever within the first few minutes; these schools
start to sound almost like enemy camps. I rarely heard professionals define themselves like this in
the USA. I would not suggest that one country is better than another because of this; I just make the
observation. I would, however, remind professionals that the patient, at least initially, feels like
someone in a burning building who does not particularly care what colour the fire engine is, or
what depot it comes from, just as long as it puts the fire out.


My situation now is vastly improved. I could not possibly have written this a year ago, for
instance (of course, among other things, I've learned that I'm going to have to take much of the
responsibility for putting out my own fires, a message that is possibly more forcefully put in the
UK than in the USA). I am comfortable with my progress, though not sanguine. I have to admit
that in my current arrangements, I'm lucky enough to continue to see a highly experienced
psychiatrist at a leading centre in London, once every six weeks or so for half an hour. This has not
been entirely a matter of chance but also of contacts and pushiness on my part. He was
recommended by a (gay) GP friend with more than usual interest in psychiatry. I personally
contacted this psychiatrist. So it remains more than a little miraculous to me that his NHS
schedule had room for me. In fact, given the peculiar way that he recommends medication but
my GP has to write the prescription (a baroque oddity of the NHS's current funding routines, I
understand), my GP knows I'm seeing him and has expressed mild, somewhat eyebrow-raised
surprise that I have managed to be one of his patients. A helpful peculiarity of his practice is that
it is not catchment-area specific. I believe this is very unusual. The normal reality — treatment by
postcode — is tangible and stifling.


To wrap up the gay part. When suggesting this psychiatrist's name, my GP friend mentioned
that not only did he hold him in very high regard, but that he was gay too, ‘which can't hurt’. He's
right, it can't hurt, but for reasons I hope I've explained, this information was pretty much irrelevant
to me, and more than I needed to know. I have mentally more or less erased it.


Like heterosexuals, gay people with mental illness need access to expertise first and foremost.
That has to be policy goal number one. The expertise needs to be truly expert, to be available to all,
to be available fast and to be appropriate to the illness — not to the sexuality, race, waist measurement
or hair colour of the patient.

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This man's account of his experiences of mental health
services addresses many issues. He has had treatment since
adolescence for anxiety and depression, disorders that are
common in his family. He understands how this must have
some bearing on his own experiences but also feels daunted
by his family history and worries if he will ever become
well. He has managed to negotiate health systems in the
UK and the USA and so holds an international perspective
on what is possible and not possible, effective and not
effective — for him. Our NHS does not come out of the
comparison well, with confusing and slow referral systems,
a rigid system of ‘catchment areas’, poor coordination of
care and interminable waiting-lists. A&E; departments pick
up the pieces.


He is also gay, an issue that sometimes means people
receive less than perfect mental health care. This does
not seem to be the case for him. Nor has anyone, at least
overtly, suggested that his problems arise from
unresolved conflicts about his sexuality. We have little
evidence over whether gay men and lesbians suffer any
more mental health problems than other people because
of societal and family prejudice. He is not particularly
concerned about the sexuality of his doctor or therapist
— that consideration came well down his list of priorities
in determining who might be best equipped to help
him.


The personal warmth and response of people from
whom he sought help was of paramount importance to
him. He was much less interested in their professional
orientation or therapeutic stance. Being rescued was
uppermost in his mind and I am struck by his impression
that NHS staff sometimes seemed indifferent to his degree
of distress. Do we become inured to the predicament of
our patients as we see them daily? Does our response to
their concerns become blunted by our routine?
Encouraging our patients to write about their experiences
of our services might help us to keep a wider and more
sensitive perspective on their needs.

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm a Somali refugee with seven children. I have been separated from my husband since I became ill in
1994. I have full refugee status and live in London. I'm unemployed. I've been in and out of psychiatric
wards for the past five years. My present problem is as follows. Soon after my arrival in the UK things
started. Whenever I try to go outside the house I always see two men with a video camera filming me and
following in my footsteps.


For example, if I go shopping they are following me and waiting in front of the supermarket. Also
there is a black man who works at the underground station who has committed serious crimes in the
USA. He is also following me and wants to hurt me. At this time I was living in hostel accommodation,
but when I moved to where I live now he also moved to where I moved.


He has fixed cameras at his house and films me whenever I come out of the house. Mrs Thatcher, the
former Prime Minister, accuses me that I'm working for Sadam Hussein. Whenever I go outside the
house I see two men with cameras, and their voices say to kill her and destroy her family.


When I applied for my flat, the council arranged an appointment
for me. When I arrived at the council office I saw these two bags with
video cameras inside them pointed at me, to film my movements.


Also, when I watch the television I hear the television referring to
my name and my family name. I see on the television my hand and part
of my body. The television is always talking about my children and says
they will be destroyed and are refugees. They burn their country, they
kill each other, why are they coming here to this country?


At the hospital I was asked to have blood tests and an X-ray. The X-ray
department was fixed with cameras and computerised equipment
and was filming my every movement. The staff were humiliating me
and they beat me up and tried to assassinate me too. From that day I can
no longer trust the hospital staff.


The nurse told me that I have chest infection. Although I would like to accept the treatment I can't
trust the hospital staff. I want to be treated for the disease because I don't want to pass it on to my
children, but who can give me a guarantee that I would not be assassinated at the hospital by the people
who hurt me before?


I was given a lot of psychiatric drugs but not to great effect.


The President of Russia also accused me that I was behind the Russian submarine in which more
than one hundred men were killed.


I come from a family of two brothers and two sisters. My father was a nurse and had died. My mother
brought me up with my two brothers and sister. In 1974 I got married to my first husband, who was an
artist. I had little contact with him as he was not always with us. In 1988, when the war broke out in the
north of Somalia (Somaliland), the people where I lived in Hargeisa fled to refugee camps in
neighbouring Ethiopia. I heard that my brother was killed in the war. At this time I was living in the
capital city of Mogadishu. I had a small business and was doing OK. I immediately fled to the north

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This time we had to escape from the scene and took a lorry to the north of Somalia. We had a very difficult
journey as there were men with guns who were eager to take our belongings or even kill us. These men were
shooting at our lorry and I was nearly hit by bullets on a number of times. When I got to the refugee camps in
Ethiopia, life was difficult and we had to search for food and water the whole day.


We could not sleep in the night as there were flies biting us all over. We stayed there for almost seven months
and then fled to Djibouti, where I stayed with a cousin. My cousin treated me badly and put me in the backyard of
his house.


The climate was humid and I became weak and stressed. My husband was in England and sent me a visa. I
arrived in England in 1994. I took two of my children to the school and the teachers did not welcome me at all and
gave me unpleasant looks. At the school there were women taking pictures of me.


I was suffering from the trauma caused by the things that had been happening to my family in the war. When
I went back on a visit to Somalia my problems disappeared.


SGH is unusual in two respects. First, she has been involved with
mainstream psychiatry, including hospital admissions, for a number of
years. The vast majority of asylum-seekers and refugees in counselling'
settings are distressed but not psychologically disturbed (unless we are
going to say that this is the same thing). Second, she now sees a Somali
doctor in London. Although I do not doubt that the concerns recorded
in this account have been authentically held by the client, it has been written up not by her, but by the doctor
counsellor and (naturally) given a medical stamp. Doctors and patients do not always talk the same language:
the patient brings illness whereas the doctor has been trained to make a diagnosis, not necessarily the same
thing. This is, of course, no criticism of this or any other doctor, merely a reminder that a medical training
tends to generate a particular way of seeing and organising what the patient brings.


To me as a psychiatrist this account does seem to lend itself to a diagnosis of paranoid psychosis and
even schizophrenia — if I am to use an official (which means Western) psychiatric classification system.
But psychiatry and psychology are Western cultural products, predicated on thoroughly Western ideas
about human nature and the world, as well as on particular scientific and medical trajectories. Psychiatry
makes universalist assumptions, made less resistable by the globalisation of Western culture generally, but
what is its explanatory power in this case? Is a psychosis always a psychosis?

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although we must beware of characterising Somalis, or any other refugee population, as if they were
socially, culturally and politically homogenous, we must honour the differences between this country and
the Somali world. Their traditions, cosmology, expressions of distress and modes of help-seeking are
generally different. So too are their definitions of madness (Somali refugees in Ethiopia use the term
‘waalleh’), which is seen as capable of being caused by a physical illness, may arise for no known reason, or
follow an extreme horror or shock (‘argegah’) or impotent rage and ‘torn heart’ (‘marrora dilla’).


SGH has persecutory concerns that seem highly personalised, wide-ranging, intrusive and persistent.
What kind of disease is this? I note she dates this problem to her arrival in Britain, rather than before, and
we will have to see if it recurs once she is back here. There are at least some indications here that psychiatry
and its approaches have a less than firm grip in this case: is this because we are dealing with ‘waalleh’
rather than ‘psychosis’ or ‘schizophrenia’? Her story certainly provides a basis for the ‘argegah’ or ‘marrora
dilla’ that may precipitate ‘waalleh’, reflecting experiences of social turmoil, forced displacement, violent
loss of loved ones as well as — no less influential — the shock of immersion in an alien city and culture.


In a foreign place, the sudden loss of familiar points of reference, the lack of language, the lack of basic
knowledge and experience of how things work and of the nuances of everyday social encounters can lead
to misinterpretation and undue suspiciousness. This may be reinforced, particularly in more vulnerable
or distressed individuals, if staff in overloaded services are brusque. The promotion of negative stereotypes
about asylum-seekers in the media and elsewhere contributes. SGH seems to be referring to the
stigmatisation of asylum-seekers in one part of her remarks about television. Perhaps the teachers at her
childrens' school were unwelcoming, perhaps they were not: either way, such perceptions are not
uncommon among mentally well refugees. Nonetheless it is significant that her concerns have not waned
with time and greater familiarity with life here.


Mental health services encourage users to
play an active part in strategy, management
and in some instances, service delivery. User
satisfaction is one measure of the quality of a
service. Mental health service users are being
given a greater stake in the organisation and
delivery of services, for example in consultations over the National Service
Framework. Yet these developments will not automatically achieve a better service
for users unless professionals share in the ambitions and vision of users.


Mental health service users from ethnic minority groups have specific
dissastisfactions with services and professionals, as well as grievances about

I believe it is the professionals who need to stimulate change in systems of
care and how we conduct ourselves in our encounters with users and carers.
We should remain fully responsible for the quality of care we offer, and we
should be the driving force of change while being informed by and
empathising with users' concerns. Professionals traditionally champion the
services in which they work, always seeking to maximise the benefit to users of
those services, but it has taken a great deal of protest from users for us to take
their grievances seriously. We have to accept that we do not always see the
obvious, and perhaps our roles and responsibilities, not to mention workloads,
add to the level of insensitivity that we can show. Does user satisfaction really
need to be a performance measure for change to take place? Do professionals
really need a stigma campaign to prompt us to reflect on our practice? I
would like to think not. However, we have these measures in place as a reflection
of our inability to implement what I imagine we all wish to see realised within
mental health services. Mental health professionals may be troubled by such
challenges, as they are caught between the expectation that they are responsible
for care if it goes wrong, as well as finding that the user movement is not
sympathetic to the advice professionals give. Stigma is not only about mental
health professionals questioning their attitudes, but this is one essential part
of addressing stigma. My personal view is that as professionals we do not have
the privilege of being wounded by challenge, but we do have the privilege of
learning from challenges to our practice.

I am a forty-year-old male. Just before my thirty-second birthday I was released from Wandsworth jail, where I
served a six month sentence for deception. Upon release I was homeless, and St Martin-in-the-Fields' social care
unit got me into a hostel for the homeless in central London in April 1993.


By the summer of that year I had got a good job, and I was drinking socially and smoking a small amount of
cannabis. I was seeing the care worker from St Martin's regularly. I had a small shoplifting charge for which I got
one year's probation so I was seeing a probation officer regularly as well.


I was going in and out of deep depressions, but still managing to hold down my job and save money while
paying my own way at the hostel. I was the only resident out of some one hundred and twenty people paying their
own rent.


I did not really have a social life in the normal sense. When I went out it was on my own, to pubs in the
evenings, libraries, galleries and museums in the day. I was not taking any medication nor was I involved with any
psychiatric services at this time. Life went on pretty much as it had done for the past five years, the pattern broken
only by small prison sentences and bouts of heavy drinking.


In late summer I was interviewed and subsequently failed to get the room in the St Martin's home. I put this
down to having a job and being able to pay my own way — soon after this I stopped going to work and started
drinking heavily. I committed a series of burglaries for which I was never caught. I suddenly had more money
than I knew what to do with, so began a two month bender. I was at this point very close to suicide. I realised I was
out of control. After the bender, I went home for a long weekend at the end of summer.


The best way to describe how I was feeling now is probably disjointed. I had no cohesion in my life, seeing only
the care worker from St Martin's and my probation officer. These were the two routines in my life. I did, however,
get a place with Carr-Gomm Housing Association, but I felt out of place there surrounded by poverty and it got
me down. I became depressed again and wished I was back in the hostel. I was also very angry and bitter about my
life and situation. I had no ambition beyond finding enough money to drink and smoke cannabis.


The care worker at St Martin-in-the-Fields told me about a doctor at Great Chapel Street in Soho. I'd never
been to a psychiatrist before and I did not know what to expect. I felt like a fraud because although I knew there
was something wrong with me I could not see what the reason was myself I told him about my depression and
that I was breaking the law. I did not know what forensic psychiatrists were at this time. He gave me a prescription
for some pills, which I gave away. I went to see him a few times after this but on one occasion it was someone
different and on another occasion there were two doctors I did not know. I did not go back again and I never really
talked the few times I did go.


I realised later on, while waiting to be sectioned for having a personality disorder and needing treatment, that
had I been more forthcoming with the doctor at Great Chapel Street then this could have been avoided and there
would not have been any incidents. But it was hard for me just to come in off the street and talk to a complete
stranger about things I have been hiding all my life.

The predicament described by this man is familiar — someone
who has become homeless after leaving prison. However, he
was able to make contact with St Martin in the Fields — a
voluntary organisation that provides social services through a
day centre in Trafalgar Square. With their help, he managed to
re-establish himself in a job in spite of living in a hostel for
homeless men and experiencing significant depression. This
was no mean feat and demonstrates that he has substantial skills.


However, having a roof over his head was not enough. He
was able to survive, but was not able to make new relationships.
He felt that he needed a relatively high level of support and
experienced troublesome feelings of depression. After his
disappointment at being turned down for supported
accommodation in a hostel, he returned to a life of crime and
drinking. He had a brief contact with a psychiatrist and was
eventually admitted to hospital against his will. Several themes
emerge from his story — the vital role of voluntary sector
agencies, the social isolation of homelessness, the difficulty in
gauging the amount of support someone needs and the style
of work needed to engage with someone who is socially
marginalised or excluded.


He was effectively supported, not by statutory social
services but by services provided by the voluntary sector. They
gave help with housing and other practical issues and personal
support. They enabled him to preserve a toehold in society
but were, in the end, not enough for him to develop his inner
resources. All too often, mainstream mental health services do
not work closely with the voluntary sector.


Like many people, his outer capability disguised his inner
fragility. His apparent self-sufficiency meant that he was not
given a place at the St Martin's hostel and ended up in
accommodation with much less support. He may have been
able to cook, clean, pay his bills and even hold down a job, but
could not tolerate being alone. He described himself as feeling
‘disjointed’ — a very personal expression of what it feels to be
socially excluded. His only sustained relationships were with
helpers — his St Martin's care worker and his probation officer.
Consequently, hostel life seems to have provided him with a
sense of belonging. This kind of experience has been ignored

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He did manage to see someone from mental health services,
a psychiatrist, alone in a GP clinic. Whatever trust he had in
the psychiatrist seems to have been compromised by the fact
that on two occasions there were other people involved in the
consultation. Whether these were doctors, students or nurses
is not relevant. What comes through in his account is the sense
of wanting a confiding relationship, yet finding this diluted
and devalued by the apparently random appearance of
strangers. As he comments, it was ‘hard for me to talk to a
complete stranger about things I have been hiding all my life’.
This highlights the conflicting roles that psychiatrists may find
themselves having to adopt. They include:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• the expert, who sees a patient, assesses him or her,
pronounces a diagnosis and suggests a course of
treatment, and then is no longer directly involved
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• the teacher, whose prime interest is the education of
junior doctors and other mental health professionals
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• the ‘personal physician’, whose concern is the
continuing welfare of the patient and whom a patient
will grow to know and trust over a scries of meetings.
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


• the expert, who sees a patient, assesses him or her,
pronounces a diagnosis and suggests a course of
treatment, and then is no longer directly involved


• the teacher, whose prime interest is the education of
junior doctors and other mental health professionals


• the ‘personal physician’, whose concern is the
continuing welfare of the patient and whom a patient
will grow to know and trust over a scries of meetings.


Psychiatrists are specialists, so the roles of expert and teacher
have been traditionally to the fore in their encounters with
patients. However, with socially marginalised or excluded
patients, this approach may not work so well. Diagnosis and
treatment plans can be made, but they are unlikely to succeed
if a trusting relationship has not been established. So, it may be
that in this situation the role adopted by the psychiatrist has to
be much more that of the personal physician rather than the
expert or the teacher. The current shortage of psychiatrists in
the UK means that psychiatrists are often put in a position
where, because of lack of time, they have no option but to act as
an expert. If this is the case, they must be able to call on other
mental health colleagues who do have the time to continue
and nurture the relationship. In this situation, multidisciplinary
work is not a luxury, but a necessity.

Ten years ago, when I was considering which speciality to follow, I worried about psychiatry
for two reasons. One was the smoky environment on the wards and the second was the antireligious
sentiment.


The smoking has been dealt with; I no longer go home smelling like an ashtray. The
second problem is still an issue that I grapple with. When I talked about becoming a
psychiatrist my relatives feared I would be murdered and my friends feared for my immortal
soul. ‘Obviously’ all psychiatrists are bitter atheists (with a beard and a Viennese accent).


During my psychiatric attachment as a medical student there was a distinct shortage of
individuals willing to acknowledge a personal religious faith or even a spiritual dimension
to existence. I was concerned that, as a Christian, I would be pushed to compromise my faith
in my career.


In the UK, religion is often seen as a bolt on extra from the basic model, with Church of
England as the default setting. In most societies, however, faith is at the centre of peoples'
lives. Their religion gives meaning and structure to their experiences. To ignore religion is
to ignore a fundamental part of many people's day to day existence.


Mental health professionals tend to be less religious than average and are often uncertain
about how to respond to people's spiritual needs.


Doctors training in psychiatry are taught to consider the whole of a person's life: the
biological, social and psychological aspects; the ‘spiritual’ is not normally included. In
taking someone's psychiatric history we are told we must not avoid difficult areas, like their
sex life and whether they have ever attempted suicide. Enquiry about their spiritual or
philosophical beliefs is rarely mentioned.


Most of the major psychiatric textbooks touch on religion only as a direct correlate with
race. This is an oversimplification because it excludes, for example, those who convert to a
different religion and ignores the many variations within branches of the same faith.


There is a major overlap in the territory covered by a minister of religion and by a mental
health professional. Issues of guilt and forgiveness, choice and responsibility arise frequently
in both. However, psychiatrists are not priests nor vice versa. We must resist the tendency to
expand the influence of mental health professionals outside their true sphere. Not all guilt
is neurotic and not all low moods should be immediately medicated away. At the same time

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048388-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did decide to train in psychiatry, the smoke fumes have dissipated and there has been
growing interest in spiritual issues over the last few years.


A ‘spirituality’ special interest group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists was founded in
1999. This has provided a welcome forum for psychiatrists to discuss the area of mental
health and religion and organise joint research.


Published in 1999, the Health Education Authority booklet <i>Promoting Mental Health</i>
emphasises how Jewish and Christian communities can work with mental health services to
support service users.


Specific journals (for example, <i>Mental Health, Religion and Culture</i>; first published in
1998) are growing in circulation. Research looking at the effects of religious faith on various
physical and mental health indicators is increasing in quality and quantity (see, for example,
the American National Institute for Healthcare research at http://www.nihr.org). There is an
annual meeting on spirituality and mental health held at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.


In the future I would hope to see increased cooperation between religious leaders and
psychiatrists to improve the recognition and treatment of mental illness in their particular
community. In the West Midlands we are developing a project to educate church ministers
in the early recognition of psychosis and clinical depression. The Avalon NHS Somerset
Trust has led the way in linking chaplains directly with community mental health teams.


Mental health professionals need to recognise how their own views influence their
expectations of what life is about and what is normal behaviour. Everyone has a world view
even if they do not adhere to a formal religion. This world view influences our every
action. If your culture teaches that all suffering is illusion to be accepted without struggle,
then your behaviour is likely to be very different to that of someone whose culture teaches
the need to strive to overcome personal weakness. All those working in mental health need
ongoing training in cultural sensitivity, particularly for those who work in multicultural
areas.


Religion and psychiatry have many areas in common. Increased understanding and
tolerance on both sides will be to the advantage of all.

Desolation Boulevard<br />
Took my place, it wasn't hard,<br />
Among the cranks displaced from home<br />
Crying souls left all alone.<br />
Desolation boulevard<br />
Isolation prison yard<br />
Misfit with a brush I'm tarred<br />
Plead for help who will hear?<br />
Not God, nor state nor human near<br />
On my own, that much is clear<br />
The ghosts in my machine I fear<br />
Though when I'm blind I sometimes feel<br />
Three angels shining love so real<br />
Angels three are close to me<br />
They give me strength that you can't see<br />
They're all that touch my soul<br />
And tell me that my heart is whole.


(Note: The three angels represent Peter's
three daughters: Jessica, Sarah and Rebecca)


A shadow passed across her face<br />
Fleeting but for a moment, not disturbing sleep<br />
A moon of plenty threw shadows<br />
Like prison bars against the wall<br />
Protecting her from an untimely escape<br />
To a floor bathed in silver light.<br />
A shadow passed across her face<br />
She moved her head undisturbed<br />
As her bottle escaped empty and unwanted<br />
Full with milk and sleep<br />
Happy and content<br />
I breathed a sigh of pure relief.

Imagining, imagining, every day<br />
Troubled times have upped and gone,<br />
