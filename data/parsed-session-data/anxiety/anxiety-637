<font size="4"><b>Phone Sex</b></font>

Although the ear, nose, and throat guy dismissed it out of hand, I
was still convinced that the sleazy advertising executive whose
phone number I got at a bar in Soho—where we met and made out
briefly while standing next to the jukebox—was the sole reason for
my inner-ear infection, and that I had contracted it only moments
after my orgasm during phone sex with her the night before. It came
as no surprise, really. Because when Charlene came over the phone,
she shrieked in a way I had thought, up until that moment, was
reserved only for struggling young actresses in the middle of a desperately
off-the-mark audition for a role in some exploitative horror
flick.


If the truth be known, I believe that I deserve any hearing problems
I get from this charade of intimacy. I really do. I'm just nothing
but a "phone-orgasm junkie-monkey." That's how an ex-girlfriend
labeled me at an emergency counseling session just hours after she
caught me (in our bed, alone) fucking someone else (verbally)—or
so she thought. She barged into our bedroom with the force of the
LAPD on an ill-advised drug bust, flaunting the Polaroid camera she

At any rate, you can imagine my soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend's
embarrassment when she caught me in bed whacking off to the
juicy delivery by my phone mate on the other end of the line.


It was none other than Janus, a showgirl from Pittsburgh, an old
acquaintance of mine whom I'd met years earlier, backstage at one
of my concerts. She was on my A-List of aural concubines as she,
very much like myself, had suffered through countless years of disillusionment
in the relationship game. This, of course, fostered a
tremendous fear of intimacy, a predilection to talk dirty, hang up,
and go about her business—alone. My kinda gal.


And I've got to tell you, I rarely cheat on my girlfriends unless the
relationship has pretty much gone south. Hey, that's no excuse, but
I'd be lying if I didn't admit that talking dirty on the phone to an old
lover, from some distant hotel room, then hanging up and immediately
ordering room service, left me much less racked with guilt once
I got back home than if I had done the deed in the flesh.


On top of that (and even sadder) is that I firmly believe that I'm
better in bed on the phone than in the sack. I mean, up until the age
of about thirty-five or so, I was a pretty damn good lover. My biggest
problem was blurting out promises and lies during my orgasm. Once
I even practically yodeled in ecstasy that I could actually abandon
show business for her, and hang out in Egypt for a year while she
went over and studied King Tut or one of those old guy's remains, to
complete her master's degree. But then, what with my bad knees
acting up all the time and my ever-increasing anxiety over misleading
lovers and with my libido getting cranky, I finally gave up, opted
to just pull back, be alone and talk dirty to Ma Bell.


"Who is this?" I reply uncomfortably, over the phone, responding
to some pretty provocative sexual come-ons for what feels like the
millionth time today.


"Who do you think it is, you flirtatious, sex-crazed, repressed animal?"


"I give up, Marilyn Manson?"

"I'd laugh but I'm already wet, you crazy maniac. When can I see
you again?"


"Oh, Christ, I haven't been feeling too well."


"You never feel well... I want you inside me so badly."


"I'm expensive."


"Fuck you. Are you touching yourself?"


"I'll call you right back, some whacko is at my door," I lied and
hung up and then kept the phone off the hook as I tried to discern
just exactly who that was. I also tried to figure out why and when I'd
been intimate enough with her that she would feel comfortable—
after so many months, maybe even years, of not talking—calling me
like that. I didn't even recognize her voice.


That kind of call happens to me all the time. I obviously have
more problems with the telephone than choosing what long distance
carrier to use.


By the way, I'm not talking about those 900 numbers. Those are
bullshit, a pale imitation of the real thing—you know what I mean.
A person you <i>really know</i> on the phone is a big difference. Isn't it?
Maybe not. I mean statistics can lie, but I have to admit that about
98 percent of all the women I've spent most of my time in bed with,
on the phone, had a big problem with it. I'd hear things like, "Are
you ashamed to be seen with me in public?" or "Since I've started
dating you, Richard, my phone bill has gone up 75,000 percent and
I've never even met you in person." Okay, fine, so maybe I have a
little problem, I'm afraid to get close to a woman. There, I said it.
Now that the cat's out of the bag I can readily admit that, as a member
of this frightened species, I've devoted myself to becoming one of
the world's best damn phone lovers and it works. I can actually stay
home, do my work, have sex on the phone, and not go out until my
excuses start getting shabby.


I'll freely admit that telling a rational, fairly sensible woman I'm
dating that "an apparition sent from the Lord appeared on my refrigerator
door and told me in no uncertain terms that I was quarantined"
generally left them cold and me in "whack-off hell." I'm
starting to freak out about this because it's becoming a dilemma.

Most of the women I've met in the past few years, who were justified
in splitting after I failed to convince them that there's a much bigger,
psychological safety net, if we focus primarily on improving our
love life on the phone instead of striving for an honest-to-goodness,
adult, loving relationship, left me with no option but considering
using those disingenuous sex lines. I'm screwed either way. If I give
up phone sex with a real woman, I'll be forced to grow up and get
real. And if I decide to cave in to the sanctuary of anonymity, my
cover will surely be blown after the first month, when my ultraconservative,
squeaky-clean accountant (in a panic) might clandestinely
meet me at a restaurant on the outskirts of town to chastise me for
spending $12,786 on the phone, in June alone, calling the number
1-900-SUCK-MEE! He might, also, meaning well, think it timely for
me to let Jesus into my life.


I'm still looking for a new accountant.


By the way, know any hot, single women with commitment
issues?
