<i><b>W</b></i>hen I arrived in the city I took a cab from Port Authority
to the Paris Hotel on the Upper West Side--somebody
had recommended it as cheap and international in its clientele.
My room was an airshaft special, so narrow that I had to edge
around the bed sideways. I shared a bathroom at the end of the
hall with a group of big rough German girls. Luckily for me, they
rarely bathed.


I crossed Broadway in the mornings, bought a cardboard container
of coffee and a cheese Danish at a coffee shop and picked up
the <i>New York Times</i>, returned to my room, and spent the morning
smoking Marlboros--I can see the jaunty red and white carton now,
on the window sill over the hissing, clanking radiator--and searching
the classifieds. I made a list of the likeliest prospects and took it
down to the lobby, where I joined the line waiting to use the pay
phone. I came to recognize the elderly men who frequented the
lobby of the Paris--shrunken, toothpick-chewing characters in

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found that I was not the only recently released mental patient
walking the streets of New York. It was the fall of 1968: The psychiatric
wards had recently been emptied by deinstitutionalization, the
patients released into what psychiatrists called "the community."
The benches of the pocket parks along Broadway were lined with
lunatics--mutterers, twitchers, hallucinators, impassioned monologuists,
silent dazed sufferers. I remember encountering the first
bag lady I had ever seen. I stared wonderingly at her swollen ankles,
flecked with open sores, her layers of charcoal-gray garments, and
what I could see of her face, mysteriously lowered and only half visible
in the shadows of the cave formed by the blankets she had
wrapped around her head.


She was so unprecedented a sight that at first I took her to be a
member of some obscure religious sect. (I made other such mistaken
speculations early in my New York days--wondering, for
example, why so many Amish men seemed to be employed in the
garment district.) But soon enough I realized she was simply a penniless
madwoman, a Pat without a trust fund, and that what had happened
to her body and clothes was a consequence of living in the
cold wind and blowing grit of Broadway without shelter or self-maintenance.
Years later, when I had seen many of her more seasoned
sisters, I realized that this woman had been a pioneer shopping-bag
lady, still relatively young and new to the life. Her skin was
gray but not yet blackened by the elements, and her legs, though
puffy and wounded, had not yet stiffened into edematous columns.


One night when loneliness and sleeplessness had driven me out
of my room at the Paris to the coffee shop, and I was sitting at the

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was in a mood to feel sympathetic toward the bag lady that
evening: I had spent the day waiting in the hallway outside a temporary-employment
agency to be sent on job interviews and the
evening lying on my unmade bed at the Paris, smoking obsessively
and considering a plan to take what remained of my money and
spend it on a bus ticket back to Stockbridge. I watched her as she
shuffled out again into the night, my eyes filling with indignant
tears. Impulsively, I ordered a hamburger and french fries to go and
walked down Broadway in search of her, carrying the food in a
rapidly cooling brown paper bag. She was gone from her usual
bench. I walked a few blocks until I saw her familiar hulking silhouette
through the window of another coffee shop. I hesitated; it
seemed somehow quixotic to offer the food to her now that she had
moved on to another warm lighted place, and even more pointless
to wait outside. What had begun as a mission of impulsive kindness
now seemed like a clumsy intrusion--she had her routine, I realized,
and my well-meaning gesture could only cramp her style. I
returned to my room at the Paris, and even though by now the food
was not only cold but chilled, and utterly unappetizing, I ate the
hamburger and french fries. I found, as I turned off the light and

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was lonely, anxious, and disoriented in those early New York
days, but also braced and exhilarated. I felt dilated, open to the
smells and atmospheres and street vistas of New York in a new way,
as if a layer of batting had been removed from my senses. My new
solitude and the stringencies of my life in the city had intensified my
identification with myself. The inner commentator that had begun
to speak in my childhood and that had been silent for so many years
was beginning to be audible again, but now that voice was not only
a companion but also a warning, scolding, comforting adviser. I
talked myself through subway changes and job interviews and
insomniac hours in my bed at the Paris.


During my first months in New York, I found I was reluctant to
reestablish my therapy with Dr. Farber--I wanted to find a job and
an apartment first. Then I would be able to realize the fantasy that
mobilized me in my most discouraged moments: I would sit opposite
Dr. Farber in his new office, in one of the familiar leather chairs,
and I would proudly display for him my newly independent life.


I became a hypervigilant creature of coffee and cigarettes. My
attachment to alcohol was severed by New York; now it had become
associated in my mind with the corner bars on Broadway, grim little
caves lit by neon shamrocks and populated at night by the same
phlegmy old men who spent their mornings in the lobby of the
Paris. Once I had made the decision to stay in New York, I began to
look back on my easy Stockbridge existence as shamefully indolent
and purposeless. It seemed so distant that I felt I must have forsaken
it not weeks but years ago.


I had never felt the grain and texture of things so distinctly, never
lived a life in which the stakes seemed so nearly real--I say "nearly"

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I looked for work conscientiously, but I had no skills, no college
degree, not even a legitimate high school diploma, only the GED
certificate Dr. Farber had kept after me to acquire. I followed up on
likely-looking ads in the <i>Times</i> classified section: "well-spoken,
dynamic admin. asst. for creative ad agency," and "good English
skills a must for aide to editor in publ. co." I waited in midtown office
buildings to be called into interviews, where I was sized up and
rejected in the same instant. That was no wonder; I was a rumpled
mess with a chronic cough, a self-inflicted pixie haircut, and a three-year
gap in my history that I refused, on principle, to lie about or
even to explain in the space provided on the application form.


My first job, when I finally found it, was not one that required an
immaculate wardrobe or an advanced degree. "Lab tech. with no
exp." read the ad in the <i>New York Times</i>. I recognized myself in that
description, and I was hired on the spot, in a converted loft laboratory
above Canal Street, where I put on a dingy white coat and ran
experiments on transmission-oil samples. That job paid sixty-eight
dollars a week, take-home. My co-workers were newly arrived immigrants,
most with no English. When the first snow fell in late
November, they all left their stations and stood in a row in the diffuse
white light of the great loft windows, watching as the flakes came
slanting down. They were Ghanaian, Jamaican, Filipino, Thai;
none of them had ever seen snow before.


Most days I manned the "viscosometer," a machine that measured
the relative viscosity of three different kinds of oil at the same

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found that job several months after I left the Paris. In the meantime,
I moved from one stopgap living situation to another. The Farbers,
who had sublet a brownstone on 94th Street between Columbus
and Amsterdam, hired me to stay with their three young
children (Dr. Farber's wife--his second--was considerably younger
than he) while they went to Paris for a week. They overpaid me so
lavishly that I was able to support myself for another month.


They also brokered a deal between me and Dr. Farber's brother
Manny, an artist and movie critic. In exchange for free lodging in
the Soho studio where he was showing his paintings, I agreed to act
as hostess for the exhibition. I slept on a mattress in the center of the
empty, echoing loft, woke early in the mornings and dragged the
mattress into the back room where the artist stored his supplies, and
did my best to wash in the deep sink where he rinsed out his brushes.
I put on a dress and panty hose and a pair of black pumps, peered
into a fragment of broken, cloudy mirror to apply my lipstick, and
stationed myself in a chair by the door, where I remained from ten
until six, admitting a trickle of visitors to the show and passing out
brochures. As "hostess" I did my best to make myself invisible. I
knew nothing about painting, and I was terribly afraid someone
might assume that I could answer questions.


By the time the exhibition ended, I still knew nothing about
Manny Farber's paintings, but I had come to know them in the way
a dairy farmer knows each member of his herd. They were large
ovals executed on brown paper--speckled, pitted fields of muted,

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The loft itself was a space so big and high and empty that I felt
theatrically self-conscious walking from one end of it to the other.
Once I yielded to an impulse to dance an orbit around the splintery
parquet floor in my bare feet, pausing in front of each painting
to execute a deep bow and arm sweep.


Sometimes in the middle of a long quiet afternoon, trapped in
the studio with no phone and no distractions, a fugue of impression
would begin to build. Manny Farber's paintings, the space around
me, the smell of my own sweat, the itch of dust in my throat, the
rumble of traffic and the brief cacophonous bursts of car horns
below me in the street, the cropped view of leafless trees and red
brick and chilly sky that the light-blocking shades on the windows of
the loft permitted me--all these elements swarmed and buzzed and
swelled into epiphany. The city itself came to visit me in the empty
loft, bringing with it a vague and transporting sense of the future.


At night, released from my captivity, I went out and found
myself a sandwich or a cheap Chinese meal. The neighborhood
was given over to small retail outlets, where myriad, mystifying
hardware items were displayed in plastic buckets and sold for a
quarter apiece. I picked up these objects and examined them,
wondering what this macaroni-shaped piece of pipe was intended
for, or this thing like a tuning fork, or these little plastic slugs. The
world, the world! These objects were instruments of its purposes,
so many of which I would never know.


Another person in my circumstance might have tried to make

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I moved into my first New York apartment, a tiny two-room place on
the top floor of an East Village walk-up with a loft bed built into a
closet. The toilet was out in the hall in a sky-blue cubicle somebody
had decorated with careful copies of the graphics from "Yellow Submarine."
My roommate and I shared it with the elderly Ukrainian
woman who lived down the hall amid icons and cabbage fumes, and
a transvestite junkie who used it to shoot up in.


My roommate was Susan, a Stockbridge native. I had met her
once or twice at Simmy's during my Riggs years, and when I ran
into her on the steps of the New York Public Library and told her
about my efforts to find a job and an apartment, she generously
invited me to sleep on her couch. I stayed for a year, and paid my
half of the forty-dollar monthly rent.


Susan was gentle and dignified and sometimes a little absent.
She had moved to the East Village with a much older man, the
owner of an arty bookstore who plunged into all the practices of
the hip life and expected Susan to do the same. She was too faithful
and old-fashioned and genuinely in love with this man to comply,
and so he left her, and she joined the legions of young women
injured by the sexual revolution.


Susan's tangled blonde hair fell below her waist; she wore long
India-print skirts and quilted vests and intricate dangling earrings
and contact lenses that she was forever losing. She worked at a
secondhand fur store in the West Village when I first met her;

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of Susan's bosses was an editor named Roz, a woman only a few
years older than we were but so forthrightly careerist and prematurely
sensible in her business suits and alligator pumps that we
viewed her as a member of another generation. She sometimes
dropped off manuscripts at the apartment, staying politely to drink a
cup of coffee with us. (Susan observed the small-town custom of
inviting anyone who knocked at the door to come in and sit down.
More than once I came home to find her pouring herbal tea for our
transvestite junkie neighbor.) I could not help noticing Roz's efforts
to conceal her queasy alarm as she sat at the table--the only uncluttered
surface in the apartment--casting uneasy glances at the
kitchen bathtub and the box turtle that Susan kept in it, while Susan
stepped delicately around the cat's overflowing litter box and crusted
food dishes, waiting on her guest as placidly as any farm wife with
pies cooling on her windowsill.


I think of Roz now because I've come, in later years, to be surrounded
by academic overachievers, many of whom apparently
slogged through the 1960s with their heads down, following the
track of some ambition so doggedly that all the craziness of that

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My own attitude toward the 1960s was ambivalent at first, and
gradually become more and more contrarian. I identified with the
anarchic energies of the period--the music, the colors, the strobe
lights, the hair, and the dancing. I began by finding a certain comfort
in being part of a generation that had disowned its parents; surrounded
by the youth culture, I could blur the painful reality that it
was actually my parents who had disowned me. But soon enough, of
course, something in my viscera executed a flip, and I found myself
outside the world of my generation, looking in with a familiar disenfranchised
longing, and also a certain resentment.


Even at Riggs I had resisted the idea of taking therapeutic drugs.
I certainly did my share of drinking, but I was the only patient I
knew who went without medication throughout my entire hospitalization.
(It occurs to me now that my native aversion to drugs was
surely one of the reasons Dr. Farber chose me as a patient. He took
a very hard line on the use of tranquilizers and sedatives.) Living in
the East Village, I found that I also felt obscurely disinclined to take
the recreational drugs on offer there. The few times I smoked marijuana
I was terrified by my inability to keep track of the syntax of my
sentences.


I began to feel that the whole notion of psychedelic enlightenment
had something totalitarian at its heart, that under the influence
of drugs I would be expected to discover no difference between
my subjectivity and everyone else's. Marijuana was a powerful leveler:
Having smoked it, everybody's head was assumed to be populated
by throbbing neon mandalas and ranks of dancing cartoon

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But even if I had wanted to join the youth culture, I had come to
the East Village a little too late to find it. A year after its passing, it
was hard to understand what the "summer of love" could have
meant. The place was just too scary and crime-ridden and filthy, and
it seemed to me that it would take a powerful hallucinogen indeed
to make Avenue C, where squadrons of Hell's Angels massed on the
corners, revving their bikes and throwing back quart bottles of ale,
feel like a haven of peace and love. I had arrived just as the movement
was shifting its focus from urban collective to rural commune.
The hippies were decamping for Vermont, to try their hands at
organic farming. They took their enchantments with them, returning
the streets of the East Village to their aboriginal bleakness.


Eventually I was to find the political aspect of the youth movement
even more off-putting than the ecstatic, druggy wing. Later
in my New York years, after I had moved out of the East Village
and into an apartment far uptown near Fort Tryon Park and the
Cloisters, I found a job at Columbia University in the Academic
Placement Office, where I photocopied and collated the dossiers
of graduate students who were applying for teaching jobs. I also
filed, and fetched coffee from Chock full o' Nuts. I was the lowest-ranking
person in the office, but this was the most respectable job
I had yet found, and the best-paying.


I was always on the point of losing it because of my chronic lateness,
and I was in particular jeopardy just when one of the student

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so began my brief career as a scab. The first morning of the
shutdown, I stood outside Dodge Hall, blocked from the entrance
by a moat of shouting protesters that stretched all the way around the
building. "Shut it down!" they shouted, swaying in their comradely
ranks as I waited timidly for the right moment to make a run for it;
sometimes I succeeded, ducking and dodging through the line, but
more often I failed. Once I was elevated in a chair of interlocked
hands and given the heave-ho, landing with an arm-flailing stagger
several feet away on the icy grass. After that, there was nothing to do
but try again. When I finally reported for work, I found that only my
boss was present; apparently she had driven in from New Jersey
before dawn.


The image of the rosy, angry young faces of those protesters
has remained in my mind ever since, and I can still feel the stinging
freshness of my resentment. Like them, I opposed the Vietnam
War, but the notion of closing down the university to end it
struck me as patently ridiculous--like masturbating to end the
population explosion, as somebody later put it.


What gave me particular pain was that I could not help recognizing
the personal sources of my political resentments. These protesters,
wrapped up warmly in mufflers and tasseled hats, were all so

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knew these young men, and what I felt toward them was something
like blue-collar scorn. They were the high achievers who
could be always depended on to scribble a few sentences after the
exam proctor called time. Their brief careers as insurrectionists
would have no lasting effect on their lives; in twenty-five years they
would sit in boardrooms and corner offices, looking back on their
days of rage with fond detachment. Revolutionaries, indeed! They
were loved children, every one. Watching them, I first felt that rancorous
self-pity that has been the emotional legacy of the 1960s.


Under my simple envious anger, I was also beginning to sense
the depth of my estrangement from the politics of the youth culture.
I was coming to hate the bullying notion that one was either part of
the problem or part of the solution, that one was to lead, follow, or
get out of the way, that to be apolitical was itself a political position.
I was beginning to know myself now, to recognize that I was the kind
of person who accepted what Dr. Farber would have called "the
given." My ambition was not to change the world but to describe it.


Dr. Farber and I were spending a lot of time on the subject of
demonstrations, drugs, and the youth culture generally. Since the
move to New York, his view of the 1960s had shifted from bemused
curiosity to something closer to scorn. Was I merely reflecting his
influence? Not in this case, I believe--though I certainly tended to
imitate him, and to parrot his favorite phrases. I brought my own set
of preoccupations to my attitudes about my cohort in the 1960s, and
something quite genuinely and independently curmudgeonly in me

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Soon after I moved into Susan's apartment, she left for the weekend,
and my old Stockbridge friend Caroline came to visit. We
had just returned from dinner at Katz's Delicatessen and a walk
around the neighborhood. I was briefly enjoying the novel sensation
of having the upper hand in our friendship: Caroline had
been impressed by the corned beef sandwich and Dr. Brown's
Cel-Ray tonic I ordered for her at Katz's and gratifyingly appalled
by the junkies nodding on the stoop. She hung back as we stepped
around them on our way into the building. They were absolutely
harmless, I reassured her, too stoned to move. Caroline was on my
own newly won territory now; I got to demonstrate my urban savvy
while she was left with the role of the wide-eyed country cousin.


Just as we were taking off our coats, we heard a knock at the door.
I opened it, and two men shouldered their way into the apartment,
one of whom, I realized, was the more alert-looking of the junkies
we had passed a few moments earlier. He was pointing a gun with a
long silencer at us, and his companion had a knife. They shoved us
onto the couch. Don't move, they warned us. Don't move and--
they actually used this phrase--nobody gets hurt.


I was too terrified not to giggle. Caroline was indignant. How
<i>dare</i> they, she stage-whispered as the two men rifled through my
roommate's bureau drawer and systematically overturned kitchen
canisters. I dug my fingernails into the back of her hand and
hissed at her to shut up. I hated her for her reflexive sense of entitlement,

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I could signal to her to take them off, to hide them, the
man with the gun returned, holding the shoe box in which my
roommate kept her bound quarters and fifty-cent pieces. How much
in here, he asked. Oh, fifty dollars, at least, I said, estimating blithely,
though I had no idea. Anything else? I pointed at my purse, which
the gunman stooped to pick up, still keeping his eyes fixed on us. He
fished out my wallet.


How about yours? Caroline hesitated, and then pulled her
purse from behind the sofa cushion. The sight of the gun had persuaded
her. Apparently satisfied with our wallets and Susan's box
of coins, the two men backed out of the apartment, but not before
the one who had been doing the talking offered an apology, an
explanation, and a warning. We know you're good people, he said.
Understand. We're doing this for a brother in jail.


While his partner waited by the door, his face sullen and unreadable,
the spokesman came back into the room and handed me a joint
of marijuana, smiling sweetly when I accepted it. The sight of his
small picket teeth made me realize I had seen him several times
before, coming out of the apartment of the transvestite junkie.


Finally they left; the door closed behind them, but just as Caroline
and I were rising to our feet, it opened again. The spokesman
leaned into the room and waggled the gun at us. Don't call the
police, he said. We'll know and we'll come back and kill you.


We waited ten minutes before we called. When the police did
come, some twenty minutes later, they shook their heads regretfully
at our delay in calling. Those guys are long gone, they said.
No point in going after them now. One of them caught sight of

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The robbery marked the beginning of my dependent collapse onto
the Farbers. It was also the beginning of an intensely rewarding
friendship with Dr. Farber's wife Anne, which I still enjoy today. She
was the one who received Caroline and me when we appeared at
her door that night, embraced and comforted us, gave us each a
restorative snifter of brandy, and sat with us while we told our conflicting
accounts of the event. It was then that I first appreciated how
intensely she listens, with a grand theatricality--she leaned into our
narratives, gripping our hands and wincing at our terror--and a passionately
genuine concern. This was the first of many talks with
Anne, and I came to appreciate not only her generosity but also the
clarity and rigor of her intellect and the delicacy of her tact.


Anne was in her late thirties then, less than twenty years my
senior, a beautiful, vivid woman of Manx ancestry, thriving in her
marriage and harried motherhood, a musician and accompanist and
all-purpose intellectual. She was in the habit of reading several
books simultaneously, keeping them at various stations around the
apartment--one in the bedroom, one in the living room, one in the
kitchen. Her energy was staggering; she was like a many-armed
Indian goddess, one hand stirring a sauce, one composing a sentence,
several holding open books, another feeling a feverish child's
forehead. She was a collection of broken or transcended expectations,
managing to be simultaneously self-dramatizing and sincere,
a woman of action and a true contemplative. Gradually, I began to
understand the importance of her contribution to Dr. Farber's writing
and thinking. Their marriage was absolutely traditional in one
sense--I never saw Dr. Farber so much as rinse out a saucer--but

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After the robbery I began to spend more time at the Farbers'. I
was very fond of the three Farber children, and always happy to sit
for them, but soon enough, I began to feel I needed no excuse to
drop by. The Farbers had moved by now to a ten-room, highceilinged
Upper West Side apartment in a building between Broadway
and West End, an easy place to find oneself late in the afternoon,
not only for me but for many interesting people. I was
reassured to notice that other patients felt free to visit, perhaps not
quite as frequently as I did, but often enough. Various intellectuals,
writers, artists, musical people, and Jesuit priests--Dr. Farber
seemed to like to keep a few of these around--also began to appear.


The Farbers' living room became an informal salon, a setting for
contentious debate and intimate, self-revealing talk. These discussions
were a revelation to me; I had never realized that it was possible
for a group of smart, witty, intellectually combative people to
join in a project of talking their way toward the truth. Now I understood
how starved I had been for talk: The discussion at my parents'
table had been severely circumscribed. As for my own generation,
they were doing their best to stay below the level of the verbal. Their
talk was gestural, full of sloganeering and self-justification; they celebrated
their inarticulateness and made a stiff, blundering golem
out of moral discrimination.


I was too shy to contribute much, but I sat and listened. On a few
occasions I gathered the courage to blurt something out, and once,
with Dr. Farber's encouragement--he actually held up a hand and
silenced the cross talk in order to give me a chance to break out of
my hemming and hawing--I said something valuable. I've long

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was "shy"? I "listened"? I can't let these inaccuracies pass
uncorrected. I was never shy; what looked like shyness was intense
self-consciousness and self-doubt and--struggling against these constraints--a
ferocious ambition to be heard. I listened only intermittently
(perhaps this is why I learned so little), pouncing on remarks
and pawing them over for what was of use in them to me. By the
time I had torn open a particular unit of discourse, swallowed the
nutrient, and discarded the residue, the conversation had moved on
and I had missed some essential connective.


Anne, with her generous energies, took the lead in these
evenings. Dr. Farber rarely stayed until the end. He had an odd way
of rising abruptly from his seat, bowing to the assembled company,
and simply walking out of the room. It seemed to me sometimes as
I watched him (and my eyes were always returning to his face) that
he was suddenly overwhelmed with weariness and something close
to disgust, that he had been registering not only the content of the
discussion but also the sparring of egos, and that he suddenly had
endured all of that he could bear. (Not that he was egoless himself;
he had a weakness, in fact, for the company of celebrities, and his
one besetting minor sin was name-dropping.) Perhaps it was not
only the competitiveness of the enterprise that drove him away; it
seemed to me sometimes that he found the energy of these discussions--an
energy fueled by alcohol, in the case of some of the participants--a
little crude and overwhelming. I think he withdrew to
protect the privacy of his most closely held beliefs.


Often I was one of the last people present at the end of the

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And sometimes after the dishwasher had been loaded and the
surfaces scrubbed, I stayed on until very late, talking with Anne.
These were long, deep, confessional conversations. She told me
the story of her romance with Leslie Farber: Some ten years earlier,
as his patient, she had fallen in love with him. He terminated
the therapy after three months without explanation, she told me,
and when, six years later, they found one another again, he confessed
he had been in love with her as well--all this time--and
that it was for this reason he had fired her as his patient.


Though I did my best to conceal it, my reaction to this story was
mild shock and a faint queasiness. While I recognized and
responded to his masculine elegance, I was so backward as never to
have contemplated the idea of Dr. Farber as an erotic being. I considered
him an old man, and beyond all that. A stubborn innocence
seems to have been hard-wired into my thinking; in spite of all my
exposure to psychotherapy and my youthful promiscuity, I persisted

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the Farber family that drew me even more powerfully than
the talk of the salon that met irregularly at their apartment. It was
the peace of a family dinner at their table, a peace that reigned
imperturbably over all the squabbles and tiresomeness that three
energetic young children could be counted upon to create. It was
the softening I saw in Dr. Farber's eyes when he looked at his children
(they addressed him, charmingly, as "Father"). It was the
sense that in this family, whatever its problems and complexities,
everything was deeply and solidly all right, and also--as in all
families--fragile, contingent, and precious. "What family life
teaches us about time is that it goes," Dr. Farber wrote in a late
essay, "--that what it brings or gives or permits, it also transforms
or hardens or takes away."


In that same essay, "Family Reunion," he defined family life as "a
passionate daily traffic in perishables." In the Farber's apartment, I
watched the swirling and eddying of that traffic. I watched as Anne
directed it, as she tirelessly encouraged and chastened and interrogated,
as one drama after another was enacted in her kitchen--tears,
angry storms, delighted discoveries, reconciliations, early attempts at
jokes.


It was from the Farbers that I learned about family, its purposes,
its inescapability, its centrality in any notion of a good life. Characteristically,
it was Dr. Farber who taught me the distanced view, the
family under the aspect of time. From Anne I learned about dailiness.
When I remember her, surrounded by the blur of her young
children, who are grown now and surrounded by children of their
own, I think of the poem by Randall Jarrell called "Well Water."

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

...<i>And yet sometimes<br />
The wheel turns of its own weight, the rusty<br />
Pump pumps over your sweating face the clear<br />
Water, cold, so cold! you cup your hands<br />
And gulp from them the dailiness of life</i>.


Anne took care of me in New York. She fed me: I ate at least two
dinners a week at her table, and many breakfasts too, on mornings
after the nights when it got too late to contemplate taking the subway
home. She clothed me: When I was too poor to buy a coat, she
gave me an old one of hers. My kitchen was equipped with her castoffs.
She offered me all kinds of practical help, lending me money
and referring me to a gynecologist and dispatching her oldest son,
Luke, to help me when I moved into my new apartment; he and I
took multiple uptown trips on the subway, carrying my possessions
in boxes. He spent a Saturday afternoon with me prying layers of old
linoleum off the floors of the hall and kitchen. In return, he got to
keep all the loose change this archeological dig unearthed.


I remember bursting into tears one day when Anne opened
the door to their apartment, collapsing into her arms and sobbing.
I don't recall the reason; perhaps I had been jostled too roughly
on the rush-hour subway. She sat me down at the kitchen table,
gave me a cup of tea, and waited receptively while I composed
myself and tried to talk. I think I said that New York was just too
much for me, that it was too hard--something like this. Anne took
my hands and engaged my eyes and said, "You're thriving. In your
own odd way you're thriving." And she was right--at least half
right. If it's possible to thrive and collapse simultaneously, I suppose
this is what I was doing in New York.


I stuck it out in the East Village until my roommate and I

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Before I left the city, Dr. Farber advised me to keep my emotional
distance from my parents. Don't look to them for approval, he
warned. That could kill you, he added. These were his exact words,
and I remember feeling startled and a little puzzled by them.


My mother remarked on my pallor. I went to the dentist, bought
some clothes, and slept for twelve hours at a stretch. The Farbers
sent me a bottle of cognac for my birthday; I drank a small glass of it
every night before bed. Dr. Farber replied to all my letters. I especially
remember a passage in which he responded to my complaints
about my father's behavioral tics at the dinner table. His own father,
wrote Dr. Farber, had had a habit of sucking the marrow out of
chicken bones. When Dr. Farber, then a teenager, registered his
vehement objections to this practice, his mother gently intervened:
That's the best part of the chicken for your father, she explained. His
father looked up briefly during this exchange, Dr. Farber wrote, and
then returned, all the more vigorously, to his sucking. Never in all
eternity, Dr. Farber wrote, will anything redeem this moment for
either my father or me.


When I returned to New York, I moved uptown. My new apartment,
for which I paid all of sixty dollars rent a month, was fairly
roomy in a chopped-up way, but except for its front room, which had
a large window looking out on Isham Street, it was very dark and
made more so by the blue-green color of its walls. All the rooms, but
especially the tiny dark bedroom, dominated by a large crucifix

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I knew this because the super told me. You're lucky, he said. You
only get a bargain like this when somebody dies. He was a big
friendly black man who dropped by frequently. He always refused
my invitations to come in, but as he stood at the door, his feet rooted
on the tile of the hall, he braced one hand on the doorjamb and
leaned so far into the apartment that by rotating his head he was able
to survey the living room, the kitchen, and--if I had left the door
open--the bedroom. Once he noticed a can of paint I had left in the
hall. "I see you're a fixing-up young lady," he remarked approvingly.


Briefly, I was. After Luke Farber and I had pried off the old
linoleum, my brother took the bus from Baltimore, where he was
working as a conscientious objector, emptying bedpans in a hospital,
and the two of us spent a weekend sanding and staining the
floors. It was midsummer, I remember, and we had a happy, sweaty
time together, drinking beer and working until well after dark, then
walking out into the night coolness and taking a turn through Fort
Tryon Park.


Before Andy's visit, I had felt a little like an intruder in this
remote neighborhood, as yet uncolonized by the young and hip, so
far uptown that its air seemed rarefied. With its meandering residential
streets and squat gray apartment buildings with deep, shadowed
courtyards, Inwood was reminiscent of a slightly grim quarter
in some European city--Brussels? Berlin? Its main commercial
artery, bustling Dyckman Street, lined with fabric and notions stores
and fruit stands where women in kerchiefs haggled with vendors
over the price of bruised pears, had an exotically parochial aspect. I
had never lived entirely alone before, and the streets of Inwood

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the weeks that followed, I borrowed a ladder and a dropcloth
from Mr. Brown and made a start on painting the front
room, the one with the view of Isham Street. I painted every night
after work, listening to scratchy top-ten hits on the transistor radio
Andy had given me, and by the end of the week I had managed to
complete three walls. Then, for some reason, my project stalled,
and that stall became institutionalized; the ladder and dropcloth
stayed where they were, not just for weeks but for more than a
year. It was only much later, after I first began to see the man who
would eventually become my husband, that I pried the hardened
brush off the top of the paint can, washed it out, and began again.


The super's three young sons awaited me when I came home from
work. They hid under the stairs in the lobby, watching me while I
collected my mail--what there was of it--and as I climbed the stairs
I heard their voices. "Hoo, hoo," they softly called out, "White Owl!
White Owl!" Not until I happened to notice a box of White Owl
cigars at the tobacco store on Dyckman Street did I understand the
reference. They were comparing me to the White Owl girl, in her
feathered owl-cap, and when I took an objective look at my homemade
haircut in the bathroom mirror, I could see why.

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had fully expected to be fired from my job at Columbia, and
one day a few months after I moved into my Inwood apartment, I
was. I worked briefly as a temp, alphabetizing insurance claims
made on behalf of people who had died in dentists' chairs under
nitrous oxide, then found a job in midtown as a tape cataloguer at
Recording for the Blind. I was fired there too, and moved on to a job
manning a switchboard in the Empire State Building in the offices
of a boys' clothing manufacturer. I was made to understand from the
beginning that a new, automated phone system was due to be
installed in six months, after which the company would no longer
require me.


This was an ideal job. I was able to sit behind the board, shielded
from the eyes of my immediate supervisor, and read novels all day. I
never quite learned how to operate the system, and I disconnected
many a call between the New York offices and the southern factories
where the boys' pants were manufactured, but I felt secure in the
certainty that nobody would bother to fire me when my tenure was
so short.


When I grew tired of reading, I watched. The intrigues of the secretaries
were diverting; they used me as an aside-catcher, as if the
office were a stage and I was a prompter seated in the wings. The four
of them were eternally feuding, and as they passed my station, they
signaled their exasperation with one another to me, tossing their
heads and rolling their eyes in my direction. The salesmen were a
jolly, boorish, bibulous bunch, with their wide ties and mutton-chop
sideburns. They were forever going to and coming back from lunch,
and their peevish wives were forever calling from Long Island to track
them down. They traveled in a pack, singing "Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog",
boogie-walking through the outer office, snapping their fingers
and winking at me conspiratorially as they went out the door.

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The only other nonaligned person in the office was the boss
himself, the man who had hired me--largely out of sympathy, I'm
sure--a decent, conscientious, worried person. He had a habit of
pacing in and out of his office, and when our eyes met, we smiled.


Every afternoon as I got on the uptown subway, I wrestled with
the same decision: Would I stay on the train all the way to my stop
and trudge up the stairs to my apartment where legions of cockroaches
were preparing to scuttle at the flick of the light switch?
Or would I yield to the temptation to spend another evening at
the Farbers?


About half the time I managed to lash myself to the subway
pole and stay on until my 211th Street stop. On my way home
from the subway, I ducked into the small Italian deli just below
the El and bought my standard dinner, liverwurst and marinated
red peppers on rye bread and a container of chocolate milk. I ate
this curled up on the couch in the three-quarters-painted front
room with the window looking out on Isham Street. I owned only
three other pieces of furniture--my bed, a canvas butterfly chair,
and a small wrought-iron table with an octagonal marble top.


I watched TV while I ate; or at least I watched TV until the
TV was stolen, as every electrical object I owned eventually was. I
spent the rest of the evening sitting in the butterfly chair and looking
out on Isham, smoking and reading, or just musing.


Occasionally I had a visitor, usually my cousin Dick. He
entered silently and paced the apartment for a few hours, muttering
and scattering ashes. I found his presence disconcerting at
first, but as the months went by I began to ignore him; the two of
us behaved as if we were characters in some absurdist play--me in
my seat at the window, my back to Dick as he went on his shortleash

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Other times it was my downstairs neighbor Anton. When I saw
his face in the peephole, I knew I was in for a strenuous evening; he
would be looking for a long, intimate talk, and the visit would not
end before he had told me how special I was and made a soulful pass
at me. Anton was a short, powerfully built former speed freak from
City Island. He lived in a ground-floor apartment with his girlfriend
and another couple. This was a group of quasi hippies, all from bluecollar
backgrounds, who saw themselves as urban homesteaders,
Inwood pioneers. They had done extensive work on their apartment,
converted it from a set of lonely, historically echoing rooms to an
elaborately cozy, softly lit communal den where the four communards
sat in overstuffed armchairs--which they had found on the
street, Anton told me, and reupholstered themselves--eating
hashish brownies and playing hearts. I spent several evenings with
them, surveying their place enviously, feeling simultaneously grateful
for their friendliness and profoundly out of my element.


Here was countercultural domesticity, another strand in the
braid of the 1960s. I appreciated the genuine warmth with which
Anton and his roommates welcomed me, but there was something
both smug and dismayingly provisional about their ingeniously
improvised household that no amount of <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>
resourcefulness could conceal. Once, when I had accepted the joint
that was passed to me, I looked at the faces of Anton and his roommates,
shadowed and mottled by the candlelight, and was seized by
the disordered idea that they were more elfish than human, or rather
that they were human beings in the process of becoming elves. This
was what the counterculture was about, wasn't it? Anything was
acceptable but complex and problematic human nature: Elves,

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was not a new thought for me, but in my stoned state it took
on a crazy literal-mindedness. An image sprang into my head, an
endless warren of underground chambers, connected by a tortuous
system of tunnels and crawlways. It was in one of the most remote of
these little caves that I felt I had found myself now, in the company
of four veteran den-dwellers whose coziness had turned alien and
threatening. It seemed to me that I might be both trapped and lost
forever, that I might never find my way back to the central place, the
room that communicated with the surface. I got up and left in a
panic, apologizing incoherently as Anton's concerned girlfriend followed
me to the door. When I had returned to my own chilly, bare
rooms, I was overwhelmed with relief at my escape.


The central place was not my apartment, of course, but the Farbers'.
Two or three evenings a week I lost my battle with myself
and got off the subway at 110th Street. The light and warmth and
bustle of the Farber household were irresistible, and so was the
prospect of the welcome I would get from Anne and the children.
But I was wearing out that welcome, and I knew it. The more
time I spent there, the more I began to sense that Dr. Farber was displeased
with something, perhaps with me. Often in the late afternoons
I would sit in the kitchen at the table with one or two of the
children while Anne stood at the stove sautéing onions, overseeing
the children's homework, and talking intensely with me. Dr. Farber
would come into the room rather stiffly, make himself an oldfashioned--he
drank exactly one of these every evening before dinner--and
walk out, with no remark. Sometimes Anne went on with
her several occupations, quite oblivious to him, but on other occasions

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes there was a tension between the Farbers, moments
when Anne's theatrical intensity seemed to offend and estrange
him, even to drive him out of the apartment for a solitary walk on
Broadway. I sensed that this tension was an ongoing one in their
marriage, and had nothing directly to do with me, but I also wondered
whether my presence was sometimes the occasion for it.


Once, a week or so before Christmas, I made a project of constructing
a gingerbread house with the Farber children. I spent the
afternoon doing the foundational work, the mixing of the gingerbread
and the baking, and the early evening assembling and decorating
the house with Dr. Farber's daughter Phoebe. But soon she
grew tired of this project, and it was her bedtime anyway, so I was left
in the kitchen, working doggedly into the night, studding the roof of
the house with jelly beans, constructing a rough chimney from
pieces of broken chocolate and peppermint sticks, my hands,
clothes, and hair growing sticky with the white frosting I used as
mortar. Dr. Farber sat at the table, smoking his Camels, watching
the process with weary amusement, teasing me about my willful
insistence on finishing this battered thing, which was already canting
to one side and threatening to collapse.


Eventually I gave up; it must have been close to midnight. Dr.
Farber escorted me to the door, and I remember how exhausted he
looked as he stood waiting with me for the elevator. Years later it
occurred to me that his motive in sitting up with me was not simple
politeness--though it was certainly partly that. I think he was also
doing something more primitive, something like guarding his home
and family from an interloper.

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Very early every Saturday, I took the train to Dr. Farber's office
building on 103rd Street and Riverside Drive. I can distinctly
remember the walk from the subway on Broadway on a brisk,
clear winter morning, the dry snow creaking under my shoes and
my eyes squinting and tearing in the wind and bright sun. The
city was so quiet, so muffled by snow, that a flock of pigeons coming
in for a landing in Riverside Park flapped thunderously over
my head. It was impossible not to feel exhilarated on a morning
that made the city seem so reborn, but I also remember how
grubby and vulnerable I felt, how tired and unwell and full of
excited anticipation and nonspecific dread.


Dr. Farber had a corner office, very high up, with a small kitchen
and two rooms looking down on Riverside Park and across the Hudson.
I remember him as he opened the door to his office, stepping
slightly to one side to allow me to pass. He wore a plaid shirt and a
corduroy jacket. The brown and white streaks of the river hung
behind him; his face was tired in the morning light, his jowls heavy,
his expression courteous and a little veiled.


Once seated, we talked about movies, books, some of the members
of the cast of characters who showed up at the Farbers' soirees.
These conversations were not unlike our talks at Riggs, except that
at Riggs they had sometimes magically slipped into the realm of real
dialogue. Now that no longer seemed to happen; as the months
passed I was more and more self-conscious facing Dr. Farber, straining
more and more desperately to keep him amused. To my own
ears, my words sounded stilted, falsely animated. The more desperately
I willed relation to return, the more stubbornly, of course, it
refused my overtures.


I only half acknowledged the failure of these talks, but to the

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could not help being aware of the grotesque disjunction
between the apparent playfulness and sophistication of my conversational
offerings in Dr. Farber's office and the reality of my New
York existence. The struggles of my daily life--getting to work on
time under threat of being fired, making it to the laundromat, forcing
down my terror of crime, and trying to stay clean when the hot
water in my building was more often off than on--these were things
I felt free to talk about with Anne, but not with Dr. Farber. I was too
anxious to impress him, too fearful of boring him.


And gradually, for long stretches of time, I began to stop talking
entirely. This phenomenon filled me with dread, and I remember
sitting in Dr. Farber's chair, my head turned away from him, my
hand shielding my face, silently mouthing the shapes of speech. I
became aphasic, much as I had when I sat in the darkened bedroom
of the ailing famous theologian. Dr. Farber's throat clearings and
position shiftings made me wince and grind my teeth with panicky
embarrassment, and so did the sequence of small sounds he produced
with his boxy metal cigarette lighter--the miniature clank as
it opened on its hinge, the scratch and the whir as it lit.


Perhaps if I had had a larger intellectual reservoir to draw upon,
things might have been different. But the poverty of my education

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As dialogue failed, adulation flourished. George Eliot, in a reference
to phrenology, the psychology of her day, once spoke of
her oversized "Organ of Veneration." Apparently I had one too. I
became a furtive taxonomist, dividing the world into the Farberian
and the non-Farberian. What was Farberian I would embrace;
what was non-Farberian I would reject.


But sometimes--frequently--I got it wrong. Once I told Dr.
Farber that I wanted to explore orthodox Judaism. What I knew of
his tightly guarded belief in God and his interest in Martin Buber
gave me confidence that this would please him. Dr. Farber looked
at me with amused incredulity. You want to wear a wig? he asked
me. You want to take a ritual bath every month? Seriously?


Anne, with her sympathy and generosity, readily expanded to fill
up the space between Dr. Farber and me. For this I was very grateful,
because I found the distance painful. But her concern and
care for me had the entirely unintended consequence of making
it impossible for me to reach him.


She began to take on an intercessory role. Once, for example,
soon after I had resumed my therapy with Dr. Farber, I began to
notice that his behavior toward me had become not only remote but
distinctly chilly. I panicked. Unable to bring myself to confront Dr.
Farber, I asked Anne if she had any guesses about what might be
bothering him. She questioned me: Might I be reading something
into his customary reserve? No, I said; this was different. After a few

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Paid? I asked blankly.


His <i>fee</i>, she said. He expects to be paid his fee. Stunned by my
own idiocy, I smote my forehead with my palm. The truth was it
had never occurred to me.


Dr. Farber accepted my apology graciously, and when I stammered
something about not being able to pay in full, he assured me
he would accept a payment proportionate to my income. Together,
we worked out an amount I could afford--seven dollars and fifty
cents a session.


Daniel was another of the three Riggs patients who had followed
Dr. Farber to New York, an intellectually promising and sensitive
young man with a yeshiva background. Like me, he had spent several
years languishing at Riggs, his prognosis growing steadily
worse, before Dr. Farber rescued him.


Daniel had resumed his interrupted education at Columbia,
and during the time I worked there, I often ran into him on Broadway,
at Chock full o' Nuts, and in the bookstores. We talked sometimes
on the phone, and though we were not intimate, we maintained
a concern for one another's fortunes in the city, a kind of
loose sibling connection.


For a year or so Daniel stayed on the dean's list, but then something
gave way in his life, and he began to skip classes. Eventually,
he dropped out. During one of our phone conversations, he sheepishly
confided that he had withheld this news from Dr. Farber. I felt
a frisson of excited horror at this confession. How do you get around
it? I asked, with a certain professional curiosity. I more or less avoid
the subject, said Daniel, and changed the subject.

Time passed, and Daniel continued the deception. I began to
feel obscurely troubled by my knowledge, to feel an urge to offload
it, and during one of our cozy late-night chats, I mentioned it
to Anne. She immediately passed the information along to Dr.
Farber, who confronted Daniel during his next session. I learned a
few days later from Daniel that he had been, as he put it, "thrown
out" of his therapy. Thrown out? I asked. Not exactly, he admitted.
It was more like a mutual agreement.


I went to my next Saturday morning session glowing with
schadenfreude. On the subway I prepared myself to plead
Daniel's case. I wanted to remind Dr. Farber about Daniel's history,
the oppressively high expectations of his parents, the over-shadowing
intellectual success of his older brother.


But my first glance at Dr. Farber ended that fantasy. When he
opened the door to his office, he looked steadily at the floor, and
when we were seated and I had launched into some preliminary
stammering, he raised his eyes to mine with such disgust and
anger that I fell silent. I saw now how exhausted and ill he looked,
as if he had not slept adequately for days. "How could you..." he
began, then shook his head and fell silent. I was already weeping.


When he spoke again, Dr. Farber's voice was low and hoarse,
his speech discontinuous, as if he were vocalizing only random
chopped-off segments of thought. But I got the idea. I had colluded
with a deception, and that had compromised my friendship
with Dr. Farber, and my whisperings to Anne had in turn contaminated,
if only briefly, his marriage. "How could you come into
my home," he asked, "and... solicit... my wife?"


I had meanwhile pitched myself out of my chair onto my knees.
Panic and grief had transported me, broken up a complex internal
logjam. This moment was shocking, but it arrived with a satisfying

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Never learned what? asked Dr. Farber.


That things matter, I said, and for the first time since I had
entered his office, he looked at me as if I were a fellow human
being. Yes, they do, he said.


I understood that I had gotten it wrong, unconsciously slipped
back to the precepts of my early therapeutic education. I had
reverted to thinking of the relationship between Dr. Farber and
Daniel, between Dr. Farber and me, as a game played for therapeutic
chips, not as a reality in which a community of human
connection was at stake.


But of course Dr. Farber had gotten it wrong too--I think now--
because my silence on the subject of Daniel's deception had as
much to do with simple reluctance to be a snitch as it did with any
larger failure to honor human relatedness. I realize now that the
most powerful motivator in my collusion with Daniel's dishonesty
had been my impulse toward solidarity with another adolescent in
the face of adult authority. My behavior had been stupid and callow,
but essentially innocent.


Perhaps I should have defended myself against Dr. Farber's misdirected
anger, which shocked me so much that I was unable to
assimilate its meaning. But in fact I welcomed his explosion. It was
relief at the exposure of a much deeper guilt--guilt at my own bad
faith, at my collapse into dependency, at my desperate clutching at
a friendship I knew had ended--that found expression in my tearful
contrition.

By the end of the hour, I felt that Dr. Farber had offered me a
kind of amnesty. He waved me out of his office with an air of preoccupied
disgust, but I could sense that in his exasperation, his
sense of humor had wanly reasserted itself. Before I left, I won
from him the assurance that I could return the next week.


I envied Daniel the seriousness of his transgression. I suspected that
Dr. Farber cared more about him than he did about me; his anger
was like a father's toward a beloved errant son. And like an errant
son, Daniel had been cut decisively free; he left New York and
moved to Israel, joined the army, and married there, returning to the
States years later with his young family. His dismissal from Dr. Farber's
office left him bereft, but it also served to jolt him out of a rut.
He got to keep, it seemed to me, some of his legacy from Dr. Farber,
whereas my lesser, weaker, more equivocal offense kept me tied to
Dr. Farber for another year, during which I was using mine up.


Or so I understood myself to be doing. But in the meantime I
found yet another job, serving as the amanuensis of an elderly and
hypochondriacal avant-garde composer who dictated his memoirs
to me in the study of his overheated Riverside Drive apartment. I
also met and eventually moved in with the man who was to become
my husband. George was then a graduate student in philosophy at
Columbia, very bright, analytical, and skeptical, and though he was
five years my senior, he was also, like me, very young for his age. He
took a satirical view of my attachment to Dr. Farber, comparing me
to a character in one of R. Crumb's underground comic books--the
goofy, loose-limbed Flakey Foont, always in pursuit of his guru Mr.
Natural, an irascible little visionary with a long white beard and
giant flapping bare feet.


One night, after I had returned from a walk with a friend along

A few months before my wedding, I ended my therapy with
Dr. Farber. I confessed to him that I had had little to say to him
for years. I needed to leave, I told him, because I was in danger of
becoming the acolyte who gets the master's message wrong. I
knew how little Dr. Farber wished to serve as my guru, and I knew
how particularly inappropriate my idealizing impulse toward him
was. His tendency was deflationary: He nearly always preferred a
modest exactitude to a rapturous generality.


I can see myself, I told him, twenty years from now as a barfly,
the regular who climbs onto her stool every afternoon at two and
by four o'clock is mumbling to anybody who will listen the incoherent
tale of the wise man she once knew in her youth. Dr. Farber
accepted my resignation with real warmth. My confession was
true, and he liked it because it was true, and because it had a self-immolating
boldness calculated to appeal to him. I offered it not
only because it was true, but also because it was the only way I
knew to please him.


George and I were married in Williamstown in the summer of
1972. My parents had recently bought a house there for summer
use and, they hoped, their eventual retirement. The wedding was
a hastily pulled together late afternoon affair, with rows of chairs
set up on the lawn in the shade of a catalpa tree, looking out on
uncropped fields and the encircling Berkshire mountains.

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My husband memorably described our wedding as a "barely
civil ceremony." He and I had had a shouting fight that kept us up
most of the night before, and he looks rather dazed in the photographs.
His parents appear in the pictures too, stiff and a little
stricken, seated with my parents and other wedding guests on the
flagstone patio. Looking through the pictures, I see myself in my
dress of terra cotta Mexican cotton and my ill-judged floppy pink
hat, cutting the cake and receiving presents. In many of the pictures,
I notice that I'm holding my right wrist with my left hand, as if I were
unconsciously restraining that arm from some Strangelovian rebellion.
I was doing this because, under pressure from George, I had for
the first time given up smoking, something I would attempt perhaps
thirty times over the next twenty years before I finally succeeded. In
a few shots, my expression is oddly sidelong and confiding, as if I
were sending a message to the later self who would look at these
photographs.


Here's another photograph, showing my Aunt Helen and my
paternal grandmother. I notice how bony and bowed my grandmother's
legs had become, even as her torso had thickened. This
seems to be a familial aging pattern; I saw the same change in my
father, and I can see it beginning to happen to me. Both ladies are
sitting in state on flimsy lawn chairs in the leafy shade of the catalpa
tree on this lovely summer afternoon, holding cold drinks in clear
glasses, their elderly ankles crossed. I see Caroline, looking more
like a bridesmaid, in her long dress, than I looked like a bride. I see
other aunts and uncles and family friends, my sister and her then-husband
and their small son. I see my mother, looking so harried
that there are specks of froth at the corners of her mouth, and my
newly slender father--his cardiologist had put him on a draconian

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387550-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Both my parents are dead now, of course, as are many of the relatives
who attended this wedding, and some of the friends. Perhaps
a third of the people in these photographs are gone, and looking
through them has put me in a surprisingly elegiac frame of mind--
surprising because a harshly dismissive attitude toward my parents
and their world has become so habitual to me. But what I feel is
really rather impersonal--a large, pleasant, wondering sadness. So
much time has passed; this is my simple and unoriginal thought.


To feel these emotions and think these thoughts is satisfying
and reassuring to me, because they are so exactly appropriate for a
person my age. The ceremony recorded in my wedding pictures
was hastily improvised, but the marriage has lasted, and these pictures
have become historical. Time has anchored and stabilized
this marriage that began so unhappily and inauspiciously. It has
continued for twenty-seven years, growing stronger by fits and
starts, and one of its late-arriving rewards has been a steadiness
that makes the past transparent, a pool so clear and still that I can
see all the way to its bottom. "Children are born," wrote Dr. Farber
in his essay "Family Reunion," "they grow, they grow up, they
go away from us toward their own lives, our own parents die, our
friends die, it is growing late, it is years since we began."


Anne was present at my wedding too, and her daughter Phoebe,
who looked so charming in her blue calico dress that I impulsively
pressed her into service as my flower girl. Dr. Farber did not attend.
