<font size="5"><b>1: SAME BED, DIFFERENT DREAMS</b></font>

lN HER 1972 classic, <i>The Future of Marriage</i>, sociologist Jessie
Bernard wrote that every marriage is really two: the husband's
and the wife's.


A Chinese aphorism puts it another way: "Same bed, different
dreams."


The message on my answering machine made me sad. It was
from a couple I had treated three years earlier, a husband and
wife who seemed to be doing well enough when we said good-bye.
I recognized the light Greek accent as Daphne's:


"Karl and I are in the middle of a crisis. We spent Friday
night in the emergency room. I can't take this. I want a divorce.
Please call...."


When I phoned back, they were out. I left a message, then
sat down to think about them.


<i>The emergency room?</i>

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They had no history of violence. Neither one had ever mentioned
suicide. Their initial request had actually been for family
therapy, involving Melina, Daphne's then-thirty-year-old sister,
who lived with them.


I remembered the first time I went to greet them in the waiting
room of the training hospital where I was working at the
time. One receptionist whispered to another, "That new guy
over there looks like Fabio."


Her colleague replied, "The wife could be Cher." I had no
trouble spotting them. Karl Loeb, a forty-year-old construction
worker, had a blond ponytail, tar-black eyes, and a long,
thin nose. His muscular build was the kind that made chairs
look too small for him. Karl's beefy hand circled the wrist of
Daphne, a lissome thirty-six-year-old with smoldering brown
eyes and long hair set off by rhinestone earrings. One might
have expected languorous gestures from someone so lovely,
but Daphne was restive and tense. At that moment, she was
styling her sister's hair with quick, birdlike movements. A
sweet-looking redhead, Melina was resisting the uninvited
make-over with one hand while putting on her glasses with the
other. She was the first to meet my gaze.


This image of them stayed with me like a snapshot of the
family structure. Karl couldn't get close enough to his wife,
who had eyes mainly for Melina, who was definitely in the picture
but wanted Daphne out of her hair.


Walking over to them, I remember feeling pleased and confident.
At thirty-two, with five years' experience seeing patients,
I still had a lot to learn. But fewer new patients were looking
me over and asking, "How long have you been doing this,
dear?" I introduced myself and invited them back to my office.


The problem this little family brought to me was that they
were making each other miserable. After Melina's husband

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Daphne was energetic, well-organized, and neat. Melina
was an easy-going person who-could tolerate a mess. Daphne
hectored her daily about showing some drive. Melina would
then attack Daphne for being "up my nose all the time," but
she also invited interference by regularly running out of gas,
money, and babysitters. Karl had long been the peacemaker,
but he was getting tired of it. The battle had reached its current
pitch three weeks earlier when Daphne learned she was
pregnant. She had married late, and was thrilled finally to be
having her own child. She wanted things settled before her
baby was born.


As easily as those early sessions could become shouting
matches, it was clear that there was a great deal of love in their
household and that the fighting between the sisters masked a
dense loyalty. Although they insisted that living together had
become intolerable, even the most tentative question from me
about Melina moving out set them both to weeping.


In time, all three came to realize how they had unconsciously
arranged the current situation to distract them from
the pain of the mother's death from breast cancer. Melina had
suffered two major losses in four years, and was acting childlike
to ward off the apprehensions of living alone. And as much as
Daphne wanted her space back, she had loved having her niece
there. Seven-year-old Lily brought a daily joy that helped mitigate
the memory of the mother's excruciating illness and
death. Daphne had to mourn the fact that her mother would
never know the child she was carrying. Motherhood was the

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The sisters recognized that they were duplicating a drama
from the previous generation, as their mother and her sister
had stayed bonded together with "super glue." The metaphor
was Daphne's: "They were glued together with that stuff that
tears your skin off if you're not careful."


What had passed from one generation to the next was a
habit of loving that some therapists call "enmeshment."
Mourning freed them up and made them ready for change.
Over the course of five months of sessions, the three adults,
and especially the sisters, began to feel the kind of genuine
closeness that autonomy alone permits.


Was it their goal to continue to live as a family? It was not.
Melina landed a good job and moved out. She also took her ex
husband to court for child support.


When Melina visited each week, the sisters were glad to see
each other. What impressed me most was that Daphne had
been able to say to Melina the words "I miss you" and, later, "I
love you." Ironically, many people who are enmeshed in each
other's lives are not able to say those things. For them, there is
no space between the "I" and the "you" for "love" to fit.


After Melina and Lily moved out, Daphne found herself unhappy
with Karl. For all the squabbling between the sisters,
Melina had been a good companion, more emotionally present
than Karl. If Daphne needed to talk over a decision about the
holidays, or an altercation with a neighbor, Melina was there,
easy to engage. Karl was not a big talker; his idea of a supportive
moment was rubbing her neck as he watched whatever
game was on the sports channel. If Daphne read something in
the newspaper that incensed her, Karl would tell her to relax:
World hunger was not her fault. As for housework, it was

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With just the two of them in the house now, and the baby
due in just a few months, Daphne asked Karl to remain in therapy
so they could work on their relationship.


Karl said he wouldn't mind, but he considered their marriage
"near perfect." Daphne, in contrast, felt her list of griev
ances mounting. <i>He</i> felt they were temperamental opposites
who complemented each other. She felt overworked and un
derloved. They were a case in point for Jessie Bernard's dictum:
"Every marriage is really two." Daphne's was an unhappy marriage,
and Karl's was fine—except for Daphne's unhappiness.


The problems they were having just a month after Melina left
were not unlike those of the two sisters. Daphne saw Karl as
lazy. Construction work was seasonal, and he should be doing
everything to line up other jobs, now that they had a baby coming.
Daphne was also bothered by the fact that his main interest
was wrestling. She wanted to spend weekends at the orchestra
or ballet. The fact that he did not want—in her words—"to better
himself " put her in a dither. Both came from working class,
immigrant families, and both had lived at home until they were
adults. She had managed to finish two years of college, working
long hours and living frugally to save for a house. Karl, in contrast,
was profligate. He had been introduced to gambling in his
twenties, and gambling became his life for a ten-year period he
described as "harrowing." He had reached the point of borrow
ing from loan sharks to pay off gambling debts. He would then
borrow more money to place bets. He was the youngest of five
children, tolerated by a blustering German father and adored by
a beleaguered Polish mother. She, at times, would lend him
money for gambling.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Karl first met Daphne, he was dazzled by her good
looks. He overheard her telling off a co-worker and decided
she was "part Greek goddess, part street tough." The combination
suited him.


Daphne loved his kindness and his sense of humor, and was
not aware of the gambling.


"It's not your average stereotype, is it—a blond construction
worker who gambles? But gamblers come in all shapes and
sizes," she said. "There are some women, too." Daphne said
she was drawn to Karl's handsome face. She seemed reticent to
acknowledge that their extremely satisfying sexual relationship
was one of her main reasons for marrying him. She actually
asked me if that sounded like an awful thing to say.


The question caught me off guard, and I tossed out: "Why?
Wonderful sex is important—especially to keep a marriage
going."


Daphne looked at me as though I had just revealed secrets
for splitting the atom. She repeated my simple words quietly,
with obvious relief. A more experienced therapist would have
explored this area further: Why did she feel it was an awful
thing to say? With whom did she associate that idea? Fortunately,
she was able to make use of my bluff remark.


Sex had continued to be the only uncontested area of their
relationship. At this point, all other issues—chores, leisure,
work, and English grammar—were combustible.


Karl and Daphne had not completely lost sight of the good
they had done each other. Purveyors of extremes, they knew
they had pulled each other toward some emotional center.
Daphne had become less compulsive; Karl had moved from
dissolute to responsible.


As a condition for marriage, Daphne insisted that he get
help for the gambling. She did her research and found out

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Daphne was only too happy to take on this responsibility, as
it ensured that the family's money would be well-managed. And
so it came about that for nearly ten years—through the buying
of a house, the purchase of several cars, and four years of helping
to raise their niece—Daphne had taken care of all the finances,
held the credit cards, and given Karl his "allowance."


Like all the strategies we use to make relationships function,
this one worked until it didn't. Daphne began to complain that
handling the finances alone had become onerous. In money
matters, she felt as if she was the mother and he, her son.


Talking helped. They said they had done more listening to
each other in those additional sixteen weeks of therapy than in
all their previous married life. By the time we stopped, three
things had occurred:


1. Karl announced he was ready to handle money again, and
took over the bill paying and tax figuring.


2. Daphne vowed to stop correcting him in public.


3. They agreed to alternate nights out and nights at home
watching television.


The couple stopped therapy after four months because they
felt they were ready to go out and "do it." The baby would be

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I sat waiting for them to call back that Saturday afternoon
rhree years later, I wondered if I had agreed too soon to their
ending therapy. Had Karl gotten his hands on their pension
fund and gambled it away? Had Daphne clocked him in sheer
frustration?


And what about the decision that Melina and her daughter
move out? A colleague of mine once worked with a couple
whose parents were gallingly overinvolved with them. They
had even joined the newlyweds on their honeymoon. After two
years of marriage, and with the blessing of their therapist, the
wife announced they were taking a vacation alone. That very
night, her mother had a heart attack and died. The more I
thought about the possibilities, the worse I felt.


Around dinner time I received a call from the emergency
room doctor. Daphne had been the identified patient. Her
symptoms were chest pain, tachycardia, nausea, and a feeling
she was about to die. The diagnosis: severe panic attack.


I have never had a panic attack, but I have treated many people
who suffer from these terrifying surges of anxiety. Some believe
they are dying of heart failure, and indeed, cardiac trouble
needs to be ruled out. Others speak of an overwhelming feeling
of dread that something terrible has happened or is about

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Daphne phoned me that evening, she was already
feeling better. Still ruminating over the possibilities, I was feeling
worse.


This kind of exchange of emotions—one person feels better
as another comes to feel worse is a subtle example of
"projcctive identification," a construct that will show up fre
quently in these cases. It involves the splitting off of one's
painful emotions and, in a sense, "storing" them in another
person who in some way agrees to contain them. It's not a conscious
strategy for making someone else feel bad but, rather, an
unconscious means of transmitting unbearable information.
One could say that they delayed phoning me back because they
needed me to understand their experience, to feel some inex
plicable or at least unexplained dread.


Daphne had no idea what precipitated her panic attack the
previous evening, but she said that two months earlier, a
strange kind of fear had come over her. It would strike once
a day and she would need to lie down until it passed. But yesterday
had been the worst of it, for she thought surely it was
her heart. When the medical tests turned out negative, and the
emergency-room doctor suggested anti-anxiety medication,
Daphne became angry. She said she had a therapist and wanted
to speak with her immediately. She signed a release so that the
doctor could share information with me.


Daphne had never before been the officially designated "patient."
She boasted of never having set foot in a hospital until her
baby was born. During our family sessions, she had registered

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For Daphne to have a crisis was something unheard of. In
session the next morning, she spoke of how hard it had been
to convince Karl she was in trouble.


"He thought I was exaggerating," she said.


"I hoped she was," Karl explained. "She is the Rock of
Gibraltar that everyone leans on."


Daphne had never complained of anxiety during our earlier
work. She was a busy person. If she had what she called "nervous
energy," she would clean a closet or strip a floor. I asked if she
could remember when the first attack had occurred. She had
been feeling upset since early fall, she said, when her mother-in-law
had suffered a mild stroke. Though sad and anxious, she
hadn't felt panicked. The first attack came only two months ago,
after her daughter's third birthday party. She had been packing up
Rosie's old baby clothes for a pregnant neighbor. She suddenly realized
that her daughter, while hardly grown up, was no longer a
baby. She spoke like a big girl and was amazingly self-sufficient.
Just then Daphne had felt a wave of nausea pass over her.


"I was thinking that night about her growing up and leaving
home, and I got so upset, I had to lie down."


So she did know something about the meaning of the anxiety
attacks?


"Yes, I do. I know he wants to rob me of the one fulfilling
thing in my life. And I have decided he won't. I will <i>have</i> another
child."


This was the first I was hearing about her interest in having
more children. "Insistence on" would be more accurate. And
Karl, I gathered, was just as insistent on stopping at one. I
asked to hear from him.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Call me immature or lazy or what have you," he said. "I was
never sure I could handle a kid of my own. I didn't think
I was cut out for it. I fell in love with a woman who wanted
one, so of course I wanted to have Rosie, and she is the greatest
thing that ever happened to me. I felt OK helping to raise
my niece, too. But now I'm forty-four, and she's forty. I want to
send Rosie to college. My mother is frail, and she depends on
us financially. So I can't see having more. I told her this, and
this is when it hit the fan."


To me, he sounded warm and vulnerable and responsible—
all the fhings she wanted him to be. I asked Daphne what she
was thinking at the moment.


"That I wish I had married someone else, that's what! Why
is he talking about college when she's three? She doesn't have
to go to Harvard, you know. What are you now, a Yuppie? Is
money all you think of? What about the joy of bringing new
life into this world? I am not finished with this part of my life,
and no one is going to tell me I am!"


I couldn't help noticing that I felt more sympathetic with
Karl's point of view. In the past, my sympathies were evenly divided
between them.


At the end of the session, absolutely nothing had been resolved,
but they planned to return the following week.


Daphne opened the session, saying:


"For weeks I have been obsessed with the idea of having
another baby. There is not one minute of the day when I'm not
thinking about it. I have to do it; it almost doesn't matter how.
Today I feel a <i>little</i> less obsessed. But I am still determined to
get pregnant again."


Something had changed. Daphne could now state calmly
that Karl needed to agree to another child—or she would leave
him.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was relie ved to hear her use the word "obsessed." It sug
gested that she knew there was something excessive in her de
mand. Nearly everyone has been obsessed with a desire for
something or someone at one point in time. The discomfort of
obsessive thoughts has brought many a person into therapy.
The session temporarily replaces the obsession. Therapist and
patient work together to interpret the repetitive thoughts in
question, for obsessions are rarely about their ostensible object.
An obsession with germs or food usually turns out to be
not about good health but about the desire to seize control and
the terror of losing it. The man obsessed with his wife's attraction
to another man turns out to be more fascinated with his ri
val than with her. The woman in love, obsessed with one
self-absorbed artist after another, is actually enthralled with the
creative process itself, not infrequently her own. Daphne had
to know that there was something suspect, something decid
edly nonmaternal, about insisting that her husband impregnate
her <i>now</i> or get out of her way. If the obsession was standing in
for something else, what might it be?


She had dropped several clues—too many, in fact, to pursue
in a short period of time. For example, the obsessive thoughts
began shotly after her mother-in-law's stroke. Had that event
awakened the pain of her mother's death? Was Daphne
flooded with intimations of her own mortality? If so, then the
obsession with another baby might be a way of warding off
fear of her own physical vulnerability, waning fertility, aging,
and death. Another patient of mine had once spoken candidly
of having a second baby "as a replacement child," recognizing
that the one child she already had could die.


If obsessions are not what they appear to be, their decoding
must take place on the patient's timetable, not the therapist's.
Daphne made it clear that she did not want her obsession

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By the time of this second session, Karl was showing more
distress than before. Picking at the seam of his jeans, he choked
up as he said there was just no way he could agree to more kids.


"I can't do it. This is not like buying a new sofa, Daphne. It's
some serious stuff you're talking about."


"With or without you, Karl, I am going to do it. Do you
think it would be so difficult for me to find a man who would
have sex with me?"


"What am I—<i>nothing?</i> I'm supposed to sit here and listen to
this crap about you finding some idiot to mess around with?"


"You are not ‘nothing.’ You are the only man I love and have
ever been with. You are making <i>yourself</i> into nothing."


"She says she can't give in on this issue," Karl fumed, looking
at me. "Well, guess what? I can't either!"


Sensing we had hit an impasse, I asked about other aspects
of their lives. Apart from the baby issue, things were going
well. For the three and one half years since we had said good-bye,
Karl had remained in charge of the money, responsibly
so. Daphne, for her part, had managed to cede control, and
took pleasure in the new arrangement. They were saving
money, and she had been able to stay home with Rosie, which
meant a lot to her. When Daphne was a child, her mother had
waitressed in a Greek restaurant and always came home spent.
Daphne loved being a mom. It was something she did well.
She was not finished having babies, and no one was going to
tell her she was.


I remembered her saying that it was while packing up baby
clothes for a pregnant neighbor that she had felt the first panic
attack. Was it something about this neighbor? Did the situation
evoke some particularly fierce sibling competition? Melina, her

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What Daphne could describe very clearly was the painful and
impinging emptiness that had overtaken her for months. One
thought kept recurring: If she had no baby, her life would be
over. The end of pregnancy and childbirth meant a loss too awful
to face, "like giving up an arm or a leg." In a few years, she
observed, Rosie would be in school, and each year, her daughter
would need her less. Who would she be, if not a mother?


Karl picked up on this question. He said he loved being a
parent, but he also enjoyed getting out of the house each day.
He didn't mind the physical labor most of the time, and his coworkers
were good guys. He got pleasure from passing a completed
building and saying, "I was part of that." He believed
Daphne was extremely intelligent, and felt that if she could
pour herself into work, she might give up the baby obsession.


I could see Daphne's movements constrict as he spoke. She
did not meet my gaze, fixing her eyes instead on her cuticles,
which she pushed back, one by one, as she listed the awful jobs
she had held in her life. "Kennel assistant. I was bitten twice the
first week. Secretary. You were told when you could pee. Shortorder
cook. The eighty-year-old owner would grab my thighs
while I was pouring hot grease.... Am I making my point to
the two of you? Can you not see that it was a blessing to quit
work and take care of my mother, and now my daughter?"


I certainly could.


Recalling her refrain about "bettering herself," I asked if she
had any interest in returning to college.


Karl lit up when he heard my question. We had reached the
end of the hour, and I asked Daphne if she wanted to say

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Two days later, there was a message from Daphne. She had
decided to stop therapy, as I was obviously on Karl's side. It
was not a job or a degree she wanted. She wanted another
child. She had hoped that I, as a therapist and as a woman,
would understand this. She was not about to pay someone to
preach to her for an hour about going back to school.


I was nonplussed. We spoke on the phone later that day, and
I apologized for being insensitive. It took quite a while for me
to convince her that I was not trying to push her into some
awful job where she would be exploited. I had wanted to help
her interpret in the fullest possible terms her yearnings to produce,
to create. I had not meant to imply that she should not
become a mother again. Daphne accepted my apology, but that
was not the end of it. She phoned again midweek saying she
just could not return to therapy after what I had said. Again, I
heard her out, and encouraged her to come to the session and
bring with her all her anger and disappointment. Daphne was
someone who had often been angry with her parents, but she
had never been able to show it. It was a sign of her faith in me
that she was "letting me have it" on the phone.


Daphne and Karl kept their appointment. Both looked exhausted
and, indeed, had slept little during the week because of
the fighting. Now the problem had spread.


"Before it was just the baby issue. Now she's creating a stink
about lights left on, one dish left in the sink. We're both hoarse
from screaming. Maybe she's right and we should split up. The
tension is going to kill us both."


Daphne looked solemn and defeated. "Yes," she said.
"Maybe this is it."

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl added that they had argued throughout their courtship
and marriage; they were both hot-blooded. In fact, he added, a
lot of their arguments gave way to some of their best sex.
They had often joked about this. But this was something different,
these shouts and recriminations. They did not lead to
amorous reconciliation. They had not had sex for five weeks—
a light-year for them.


Rosie had heard them arguing one night and began crying in
her room. One evening, she climbed out of her bed and stum
bled downstairs, sobbing, "Don't fight, Mommy and Daddy!"
They were mortified. Karl struck out at Daphne. "You're no
help hollering at her for messing her diaper! She's upset already!
Let her alone!"


"Leave her alone? If I don't train that child she'll be pooping
in her pants until sixth grade—like you!"


"Daphne, you are sick. I'm talking about our baby freaking
the-hell-out at night, and all you can do is dump on <i>me</i>. Do you
give a shit about your daughter right now?"


"How dare you question my love for my child! I am a better
parent than you, and a better mother than any of your sisters.
Where the hell do you get off questioning my love for Rosie?"


"I wasn't questioning your love. I was talking about first
things first. Why is your main goal always getting me in a headlook?
I am sick of this crap! I am sick of it, Daphne. Do you
hear me?"


Their voices, superimposed, were booming. I thought I saw
the lights flicker.


"You're sick? <i>You're</i> sick of this? Who is the one who got us
into therapy? You had a perfect marriage, right?"


"Don't scream in here, goddamn it!"


"I am not screaming!!! We need to solve the problem of
what Rosie has been doing this week. Were you going to sweep
that one under the rug?"

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They had always managed to keep their child out of their ar
guments, something tew raging couples can do. Again, some
thing had changed.


I interrupted the shouting to ask what they were referring
to. At three and a half, Rosie was still not potty-trained, despite
several hursts of effort on their part. What alarmed me was the
news that in the past week, the child had been reaching into her
diaper after a bowel movement to smear feces on the walls.


This sign of distress in their child was sobering, powerful
enough to create detente. They were devoted to Rosie, and
wanted to help her.


They shouted for another fifteen minutes—mostly about
who was responsible for the shouting. My ears hurt. I said I
had a suggestion.


"Do not suggest I get my tubes tied!"


"No, I certainly wasn't going to—"


"Do not suggest that I practice birth control of any kind!"


My suggestion was simply this: that the question of having
more children be set: aside for a while. We had some work to do
before returning to it. If their daughter was smearing feces,
something was wrong. Perhaps she was trying to create a stink
of her own to stop the fighting. A new baby would enter the
world at a disadvantage if the family was in an uproar. They
were not to discuss the issue in therapy or at home. There was
to be, in short, a moratorium on the "b" word.


Daphne said, "It's OK with me. I honestly can't take much
more of this fighting. I need some normalcy and so does he,
don't you?"


"Yeah, a moratorio, or whatever. I'm getting an ulcer." Near
the end of the hour, Daphne asked sheepishly if I was angry
with her for calling midweek to tell me off. I replied by reminding
her of our discussions, three years earlier, about the taboo
on showing emotions in her family of origin. In Daphne's

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I didn't hurt your feelings?" she said, refusing to budge until
I reassured her.


"She's been on pins and needles," said Karl. "She was saying,
‘Now look what I've done. I've alienated the one person in
this world who really understood me.’ I said, ‘Gee, thanks,
Daph. Why don't you worry about alienating <i>me?</i>’"


"‘When you try one-tenth as hard as Deborah has, that's
when I'll worry,’" she had replied. Daphne was relieved that
she hadn't damaged our relationship. Here we were doing important
work in the transference. At a conscious level, Daphne
wanted very much to trust my capacity to withstand her anger
without getting my feelings hurt. Nonetheless, insofar as she
transferred onto me the image of her mother, her trust remained
shaky. I apparently chose a reasonably good moment
to make an interpretation along these lines, because Daphne
showed less anxiety about losing me thereafter. Obviously, she
invested me with enormous powers of insight and compassion.
This was not a bad thing, but my hope was that she would
show Karl how to understand her ten times better.


In any case, it was a very odd session. Odd for <i>me</i>, I mean. A
moratorium on the word "baby"? This was strange stuff, given
that the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis is to say everything
that comes to mind, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant.
Was I saying I was unable to withstand the crashing surf of
emotion in the room? Maybe they <i>needed</i> to scream some more.
I needed to think about my countertransference. Although I
wasn't yet a seasoned practitioner, I was not easily overstimulated
by patients' fighting. I was not Miles, the self described
"Super-WASP" in our group of interns. Miles had never heard

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Consciously, it simply felt right to create a space for reflection.
Thinking, even listening, had become difficult because of
the level of emotion and the sheer din. And Rosie needed our
attention.


Unconsciously, what was at stake for me? In declaring this
moratorium, was I trying to quiet my own parents, or acting
out the common childhood fantasy of blocking the arrival of a
sibling? Perhaps. Daphne had hoped "that as a therapist and as
a woman" I would understand her yearning for another baby.
Two children did not strike me as excessive, certainly. My own
grandmother had twelve, and my aunt had thirteen. I knew
something about the price they paid, and thus nothing was
more important to me as a young woman than education and
having choices. Were my personal priorities preventing me
from honoring the hopes of my patient? These are questions
every therapist should be asking all the time, and I did indeed
bring them to my own analysis and clinical supervision. As for
the value of the intervention itself—the "moratorium"—that
could be assessed only later, in view of the results.


Just seven days later, Karl and Daphne looked much
brighter. They had done some talking during the week, and

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Several sessions passed in this way, with the two of them
problem solving. They were working on the friendship aspect
of their marriage, and they were clearly enjoying each other.


The moratorium had been in effect for one month when,
near the end of a session, Daphne's face again clouded over
with displeasure. She clipped her hair on top of her head and
peeled off her vest like someone paring down for a fight.


"Karl and I were saying last night that our sessions have been
easy and nice, and it's true. But in a way I have to say, ‘So what?’
We know we can get along if we avoid the thing that divides us.
That issue is not going to go away. What is the point of solving
other problems if we make no progress on the main issue?"


"She thinks we're just stalling."


"I am going to have another child, with or without him.
And I don't have forever, you know. I am already forty. How
will we know when we're ready to talk about it again? What
will be the signs?"


"She is using the ‘c’ word, instead of the ‘b’ word."


He could always make her grin.


"Really, Deborah. How will we know? I can postpone thinking
about this for a while. I can't postpone it for too long,

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Speaking of the biological clock," said Karl, "our time is up
for today. For now, we're back to the mora-TAR-ium, ain't we?"


"That: word is pronounced <i>mora-TOR-ium</i>. And yes, I am
willing to not talk about it for another week, but I think we
should talk next time about how we'll know when we're ready
to discuss it again. Karl, what do you think?"


"Yeah. I hate to say it, but yeah, we gotta face the music."


The suggestion gave me pause. I wasn't sure in that moment
how to frame an endpoint to the moratorium. However,
it was clear that they both wanted to move forward. The week
flew, and it seemed like no time had passed before the receptionist
rang my office to say, "The Loebs are here to see you,
Dr. Luepnitz."


As soon as I sat down across from them I realized some
thing: I had dreamed about them the night before. I could remember
nothing about the dream, only that they had made an
appearance. The thought made me smile. Clearly, they were on
my mind. A former therapy teacher of mine named Carl Whit
taker occasionally recounted his own dreams to his patients to
nudge them out of an emotional rut. Reporting dreams to pa
tients is not my style, however. It can blur the line between
therapy and friendship. I said nothing.


Daphne started the session by saying that although she
dreaded getting back to the main agenda, "That's why we
came here."


Karl said, "I've been hoping all week one of us would get
the flu so we could cancel the session. But if we don't talk
about the real problem, we're wasting time and money."


I said, "On the one hand, if you talk about having another
child, emotions run high and you end up in a deadlock. On the

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They nodded. Several minutes passed.


I had no solution. I decided just to rephrase the conundrum
in order to clarify things, or maybe just to buy time. I
continued:


"How is it possible to discuss something that can't be talked
about?"


"How to get to first base without both of us screaming our
lungs out?" said Karl, digging his knuckles into the back of his
neck.


I had no idea where this was going.


"I guess you'll say we never really stop thinking about it,"
Karl continued. "It's always in the back of our minds, bubbling
around the subconscious, right?"


"I hope that's true," Daphne chimed in. "Like we're working
on it even when we don't know it. Is that the theory behind the
moratorium? Boy, I'd love to know what you're thinking right
now!" Daphne turned to me.


A quiet moment passed, and I spoke, not fully sure of what
I was about to say.


"I was thinking about dreams," I said. "I agree with both of
you; important questions like these never leave our minds
completely. I'm thinking that it's time to pay close attention to
dreams."


There are many theories about the origins and meaning of
dreams. I subscribe to the Freudian view that a dream is a fulfillment
of some wish. The dream tells the wish in disguise.
Usually, therapists work with dreams as they arise in the course
of the therapy; dreaming is not given as an assignment.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Daphne sat up in her chair.


"You can count on me. I love thinking about my dreams. I
just don't know about him. You don't really dream, do you?"


"Even asleep she has to be better than me."


I mentioned that with a bit of effort—that is, by trying in
the morning to remember one's dreams or writing them
down—almost everyone is able to do this work.


At our next session, Karl said he had two dreams one night,
but couldn't remember them in the morning. Still, he was
happy to have awakened in the middle of the night knowing he
had dreamed. This was a start.


Daphne told her dream:


<i>I am at a dentist's office and find out I need two root canals.
I had been eating a sandwich. The hygienist says, "It's a good
thing it happened here, or you would have swallowed the filling."
They pulled it out of my mouth, and I wondered</i>.


She asked if it was all right to tell me her interpretation:
"There is a void in my life, and I want it filled. I'm glad I'm
here in your office."


I had many questions and interpretive thoughts of my own
about Daphne's dream, but chose not to voice them. Dream
interpretation in couple's and family therapy does not always
take the form it does in individual therapy. Working on dreams
with more than one patient in the room is something I learned
not from books or seminars but from a family in crisis years

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That session took place in the mid-1980s, and I have been
working with dreams in couples and families ever since. Were
Daphne working with me in individual therapy, I would have
asked her to tell me her associations to each element of the
dream. I would have said, for example, "Tell me about the den
list's office, about root canals, about <i>two</i> root canals, about the
hygienist, about the sandwich," and so on. This could have led
us in any number of directions, all pertaining to Daphne as an
individual and to the nature of her transference to me. I may or
may not have pointed out that the hygienist/therapist in the
dream could be a mother figure. For indeed, the "void" that
created the panic happened just after her mother in law's
stroke. This surely re evoked grief over her own mother's
death. Perhaps Daphne's desire was for mothering. In caring
for babies, she might enjoy vicariously the pleasures of being
mothered. In couple's therapy, the focus is slightly different. I
will ask both partners for associations, but it is their interaction

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After Daphne reported her dream, she was eager to drop it
and move on. Their agenda for the evening was full. They
wanted me to know that they had been at loggerheads all week.
Karl had called her a "dictator." She was so busy telling him
what to eat and how to eat it, what to say and how to pronounce
it, that even when she was clearly right about something,
he could not stand to admit it. Rosie's toilet training, for
example.


Daphne asked my advice on this issue, because he was driving
her crazy. Together they had decided that it would be best
for Rosie to join a playgroup a few hours a week. The school's
requirement, however, was that children be toilet trained.


Karl said he wanted Rosie trained, but that it was "torturing
her" to use the potty. The routine in the house was as follows.
Daphne would put Rosie on the potty and read to her. She
would cajole and encourage and sometimes leave the bathroom
for a few minutes, knowing that this often led to results. If Karl
was in the vicinity, however, Rosie would start to cry, and he
would rush in and take her off the potty. "He is teaching her
that if she screams, she will get her way," Daphne argued.


Karl replied, "It does make me the good guy. But I think
Daphne is wrong to let her cry."


Daphne volunteered the information that Karl had not been
trained until the age of five.


"It's true. I remember it. My father would scream about ‘that
filthy little shit-ass,’ and my mother would defend me and say I
was just a baby. Before kindergarten, she made sure I was
trained."

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Karl was her youngest. She smothered him. It was almost
sick."


"Maybe my mother didn't read Dr. Spock, but I turned out
OK. Now Daphne, here, was toilet-trained from birth. So she
is Mrs. Clean, and won't let anyone forget it. So who is sick, I
ask you?"


Experts on eating disorders at the Women's Therapy Centre
have a saying: "Nobody ever eats alone." Anyone familiar with
anorexia nervosa knows exactly how crowded a small kitchen can
be with phantom mothers, fathers, ex-lovers, and doctors holding
forth about food, pleasure, health, sexuality, and self-control.


Likewise, any time a parent toilet-trains a child, there are at
least two other parents in the room, evoking memories and raising
expectations about dirt and hygiene, self-reliance and dependency,
compliance and transgression. Karl and Daphne were
silent for a while. I asked what they were thinking.


Quite solemnly, Karl said, "I wanted to help her. I should
have done more."


I asked if he meant Daphne or their daughter.


"No, I mean my mother. Maybe she loved me too much, but
she really protected me. I lived in fear of this man. When he
said, ‘I brought you into this world, and I can take you out!’ you
believed it. For years, she protected me, and when I grew up, I
protected her. I wish I would have done more for her."


I was surprised by this shift of topic, but Daphne was not.
Her face, scornful when we began, softened.


"My mother-in-law is a good woman at heart. She is. I love
her, and I can't even think of losing her."


Karl's father had died five years earlier, making his mother
the last living grandparent. They spoke of her sweet, daft ways,
her perfect pierogies, her love of Rosie. Having her close had
made the loss of her own mother a bit easier for Daphne.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes, however, it made it more difficult. Sometimes it
made her miss her own mother even more.


Daphne's mother had been stern but reliable, and she adored
Melina's daughter, Lily, her one granddaughter. Daphne couldn't
believe her mother would not be around for advice about baby
things: rashes, fevers, and pacifiers. She and her mother had just
begun to be gentle, even vulnerable, with each other when her
mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Everyone told Daphne
to think happy thoughts during her pregnancy, to put sorrow
away. Surely it was what her mother would have wanted. But the
sadness over the loss of her mom, the memory of this vigorous
woman wasting away, was still there, ready to tumble out.


"Two crybabies!" she said. "I thought we were talking about
toilet training!"


It was no accident, this little detour. It was very important to
be upset about such things. Working out this grief might well
help them think more clearly about parenting. We could certainly
devote more time to talking about Daphne's mother's
death and about how best to take care of Karl's mother. And
as for Rosie, was it time to try something new?


It was time, they agreed. Daphne felt they should talk together
with Rosie, and that Karl should make it clear that he,
too, wanted her to use the potty instead of diapers. They would
offer an extra story at bedtime as a reward.


This led to immediate changes. Rosie began to get the idea,
and the hours of screaming stopped. Karl had let go of something,
a part of his own childhood, perhaps, and his daughter
did not hold on to her babyish ways so fiercely on his behalf.
Daphne, less panicked at the problem of filling the void, was
able to think more constructively about mothering.

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl dreamed: <i>I had bought a Walkman</i>.


I asked for thoughts and associations, and he could tell me
only that he had seen one while shopping and wanted to buy it
to use at the gym. Again, I had some thoughts that I chose not
to voice. (I wondered if he wanted to "<i>Walk</i>, man!")


I asked Daphne if she had any thoughts about this first
dream of his. <i>No</i>. Her smile had a trace of condescension, but
she did not criticize him. She asked if she could tell her own
dream:


<i>I had written something down, and no one could read what it
said. I don't even know if I could read it</i>.


I asked if she had any thoughts or feelings about the dream.
She did not. I invited her to take a minute to think. She said she
was drawing a blank, which was unusual for her.


"No one could read what it said," I repeated. "Maybe not
even <i>you</i>. Anything come to mind?"


She stayed quiet and pensive. "No," she said.


My first thought was that the dream expressed a wish to remain
mysterious—not to be too quickly understood. Perhaps
she was feeling exposed or misread by me, or by others.


Karl said it reminded him of something she had said the
other day.


"You said, ‘You don't remember things I tell you. I should
write everything down for you.’ Also, Daphne likes writers. We
have a neighbor who is a retired journalist. Maybe the dream is
for Walter. Maybe youse two could figure out the writing."
Daphne laughed with delight. She said:


"He's right about both things! I did say that to him yesterday.
And it's true I admire writers. To me, someone who can
put things into words.... It seems so powerful. Me, I love

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Not drag you into the gutter like me!"


They were both in a light mood and able to talk freely
about something that had long been a sore point. Daphne felt
deeply disappointed in herself for not marrying a man better
educated than her, someone who could "pull her up" and be
more showoffable as well. Karl, she said, was a man who
could talk of nothing except wrestling. And of all sports!
Football at least involved strategy, and many basketball players
were well spoken. But wrestlers were brutes and everyone
knew the games were fixed. Daphne, who had tried so hard to
improve her vocabulary and keep up with current events, was
stuck with this television guzzling, pretzel popping slouch.


This form of wounded self-esteem is the subject of Richard
Sennett and Jonathan Cobb's classic, <i>The Hidden Injuries of
Class</i>. A subject underinvestigated by psychologists, class status
influences everyone's self definition. Karl, knowing that his
wife considered him a living reproach, tried as hard as he
could, at times, to appear philistine. When an evening with
friends turned to talk of the news, Karl would sulk and ask if
he could turn on the television. One night, friends invited
them to see a movie that happened to have subtitles. He complained
through the entire picture, so that no one could enjoy
it. We talked about finding better ways of standing up for him
self. We talked about why Daphne needed a husband to be better
educated than herself. Why had she not finished college?


Daphne blamed her parents. From her earliest years, they in
sisted that boys alone should attend universities because girls

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was moved by this conversation, and by Daphne's dream
about writing something that no one, not even she, could understand.
In contrast to my initial reflection, it seemed to have
something to do with wanting to make a mark, even if she did
not yet know what it was. She had often described herself as
too emotional, as lost in her feelings. Some would say she was
dreaming about a new relationship to the world of language
and the symbolic. It would not have been surprising had she
brought in a dream about babies. Daphne had dreamed of
writing.


The dream and the discussion that followed led us back
to the question of education. Family size aside, did she want to
return to college at some point? No, Daphne said, she had
never really enjoyed it. She continued:


"And that is why I can't fill the void with work. I mean, sure,
I'd love to fill my life with an important job like yours. If I
could be a doctor or a lawyer or something, I would do that in
a minute. But if a person can't stand to be in a classroom, and
refuses to take a menial job.... Well, I've said all this before."


She mentioned that she had been tested at one time to determine
if she had a learning disability. That wasn't it. At twenty, she
could have pushed herself to study. The moment had passed.


Daphne and Karl entered their next session with big smiles.
They had good news: Karl had had a "major dream."


"No more Mickey Mouse stuff," he said.

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>I was in my parents' house. There is a lavatory on the second
floor. I am having sex with a girl from work. She is Gail, who
is married to my boss. I am worried someone will come in</i>.


He added that Gail and her husband were leaving the area
soon. I asked him to tell me anything else he could about the
dream. He said that Gail was a pretty blonde, attractive in a totally
different way from Daphne. All his life, he had wanted
beautiful women to chase him. Daphne, as striking as a movie
star, had been the only one.


He wondered if he would go the rest of his life making love
to this one person. The dream was just that, he said: a fantasy
of being with someone else. He added:


"I don't think I'm speaking out of turn, here. Daphne and
me, we're happy together in bed. At least we were. I'm sure she
has thought the same thing, haven't you?"


"I don't mind you saying that," she replied. "I have to admit,
I think about it, too, what it would be like.... I'm not going to
run out and find out. But you do wonder."


I asked what he thought the lavatory was doing in the
dream. He said it made the whole thing secretive and exciting,
but also frustrating.


Why the boss's wife? He didn't know. Nor did Daphne. A
boss and his wife could easily represent the parental couple,
making it an Oedipal dream. What had been Karl's experience
as a sexual being in his family?


"The setting could be anywhere," I said. "But in the dream
you're in your parents' house. What about that, Karl?"


Karl said his parents never told him anything about sex. His
father was tall, and Karl was a late bloomer, so the father never
missed an occasion to refer to him as "the runt." This, we

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Daphne said she saw Karl's father as a "castrating" type of
man. He seemed to want to make his son feel like nothing.


"Sometimes," she said, "Karl says I act like his father, tearing
him to shreds. He's right, too, and I feel really bad about it."


This was something we had worked on earlier in the therapy,
and it is an area in which I find Lacan's formulations helpful.
"Castration" is a very important Lacanian term—different
from but also related to Daphne's usage. When Lacan referred
to the importance of both men and women accepting our "castration,"
he was referring to the fact that none of us is psychologically
or sexually whole. Except in the case of psychotics
who actually believe they are God, we are all radically incomplete
beings—divided by our own unconscious processes,
which often seem to have the upper hand. We are speaking beings,
empowered but also doomed through language, since we
can never say exactly what we mean. Only those who accept the
fact that we are all, in this sense, "castrated" have the capacity to
love. Those men and women who assume for themselves some
kind of phallic completeness have no chance at intimacy. In
Lacanian terms, what bothered Daphne was that Karl's father
—and she herself—could act as though Karl were the only
castrated being while they, themselves, were complete. They
"tore him to shreds" to prove their superiority. It was something
Daphne wanted to stop, for his sake and for hers.


Daphne went on to say that her own parents were strict and
disparaging about sex. A premarital pregnancy would have
heaped shame upon the family, and so her mother had emphasized
the dangers of sex, not the pleasures.


Daphne and Karl were sitting close together, knees touching.
The air crinkled with pleasant tension. I broke the long

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her sententious tone made it sound as though she had offered
to perform the operation herself Karl may have heard it
that way. He was afraid the procedure would destroy his
potency.


They were pleased to report during the same session that
Rosie was doing well. She had gone to playschool and enjoyed
it a lot. She made friends, and she spoke up when she needed
the bathroom. Although there were still occasional accidents at
home, there were none at school.


The following week, Daphne came in with two dreams. In
the first:


<i>Rosie was peeing standing up, like a boy</i>.


And in the second:


<i>I was dressed in a beautiful blue sequined gown, going to a
party, or perhaps a convention</i>.


I asked for her thoughts or associations. Peeing standing up?


"All I can think of is that we've had potty training on the
brain for so long. The second dream, I don't know."


Karl asked if he could add some thoughts.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"To me, if you take the two dreams together, it's like the two
parts of her mind. She is still of two minds. She's got kids on
the brain, no secret. Maybe she is thinking of having a boy this
time. Maybe she thinks a boy would be easier. And second, she
would also like to be out in the world doing something special,
out there in the public eye."


I turned to look at Daphne. I will remember the look on her
face as long as I live. She had pressed the palms of both hands
into her cheeks and stared at him. It was a look of tender curiosity,
of tickled, sweet surprise. She had married a smart man
after all!


Daphne could scarcely speak for laughing and crying.


"I can hardly believe he's doing this! It's so intellectual. And
he's good! I mean, what he says rings true. I even said to my
sister the other day, ‘Karl can do what Deborah does!’"


<i>Karl can do what Deborah does</i>. It was my turn to light up like a
lamp.


"It's true, Karl, isn't it?" I said this because I couldn't dance
on the table.


"What! Did youse really think I couldn't learn this stuff?" he
said. "I like it. It's very interesting."


"I thought you'd think it was goofy," she said.


"No, I think <i>you're</i> goofy," he deadpanned. "Dreams are very
serious things. Dreams are OK."


"What if he puts you out of business, Deborah? I mean, I'm
just kidding."


They held hands and looked at each other, and seemed to be
making little private jokes.


I was thrilled that she didn't need me to be the keeper of the
magic. Karl was rising to the occasion.


Daphne returned to the dream itself. She never would have
decoded it, she said. She kept thinking, "What is my daughter

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"If I had a boy, it would be the first in the family." This was
something I hadn't put together. Melina had a daughter, and
her brothers also had daughters. Daphne wanted one more
chance to win this particular contest. Giving baby clothes to
the neighbor had signaled she was leaving the race. And why
was it so important to have a boy in the family?


"Because boys have certain advantages," she said. "No matter
what people say, it's still a man's world." Karl intervened:
"No, we're trying to change that, right? Rosie can be a doctor,
or lawyer, or plumber, or rock star, or whatever she wants,
right? Maybe a wrestler."


Daphne nodded.


This is a difficult subject for many parents, however, because
irrational notions come into play. When stated, they can
sound callous or superannuated. I remembered the privileges
Daphne's brothers enjoyed. Their names were "James" and
"Peter" but she referred to them as "Zeus" and "Apollo."


"They were treated as gods, yes. They didn't have to do anything;
they were just adored. I always had to prove myself the
loyal daughter. The boys could cut school, smoke cigarettes,
have sex, go to college. Melina and I did the housework and
had a curfew. When we grew up, we had to help with every
medical problem my parents had. They didn't even like to complain
when my brothers were around, so as not to upset them.
And their wives treat them the same way."


Somewhere, not far from the surface, lurked the desire to
produce the privileged character she could not be.


How did Karl feel about having a son?

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I was relieved to know Rosie was a girl. In the sonogram
room I said, ‘Thank you, Lord!’ I just think girls are better, less
sneaky."


Daphne suddenly had the thought that Karl's explanation
did not go to the heart of the matter. He was probably afraid
to have a son because of the relationship he had with his own
father. Karl said that if he had a boy he would want to treat
him "exactly the opposite" of the way he had been treated. But
there would always be a worry, he said, that he'd end up acting
like the old man.


They were so engrossed in the discussion, I could hardly get
them out the door that night. I heard them in the lobby talking
with great energy about this, and found them a week later in
that same spot, as though they had spent the entire week in a
deep, satisfying exchange of ideas.


Daphne and Karl were doing well. Perhaps some backsliding
was inevitable. Just before Christmas, they came in looking
troubled. Karl had bought a gold chain for her from a shady
character on the street. She was weeping. It was a "hot neck
lace," she insisted. It belonged to another person, who lost it to
a thief.


Karl argued it just wasn't so. The guy was pawning his own
stuff because he was short of cash.


Yet Karl looked ashamed. Daphne labeled the act dishonest,
hence gambling, and thus something that should be discussed
in his GA group.


He protested that he simply wanted her to have something
sensational, and felt inadequate for not being able to spend a
lot on her. Perhaps, I said, he was angry at her for years of

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl saw it as wrong, but not as gambling, and he did not
want to bring GA into it. His late father was a maintenance
man who used to brag about all the cleaning supplies he had
stolen from work. Karl figured that as an immigrant, his father
felt entitled to do that. Karl senior worked so hard, felt he gave
so much of himself, that he deserved whatever he could get his
hands on. Those free boxes of tissues and soap meant the
world to him.


I asked Karl if he had any idea why he himself would do
this, give a kind of loyal nod to his father, at this particular
time.


Karl said he did not know, except that he always thought of
his father around Christmas. He liked to go to the cemetery,
but this year, things had been too busy around the house. He
hadn't wanted to ask Daphne to go with him.


"I would have gone with you! Is that what this is about? I
want to know what you are planning to do with that necklace.
Can you take it back to the guy?"


"Are you kidding?"


"See my point, it was stolen!"


Karl suggested donating the necklace to a Thrift-for-AIDS
shop. Daphne said that that idea was the best gift he had ever
given her. They agreed to visit the graves of all three parents
over the holidays.


It was the first good Christmas they had had in a while.
Things were going so well that Karl brought up the question of
sex, wanting to use contraception, and even raising the issue
of a vasectomy. Daphne was livid.


"Yes, I miss making love, too. Believe me!" she said at our
first session of the new year. "But I am not using birth control.

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl did not wait for me to prompt him. He was on the
verge of crying, but that did not silence him. His thin lips quivered
on every word: "We have been coming here for months
now, and saying things are better. They are better: But what are
we going to do about this? When I was gambling, I didn't give a
shit. I felt I had no future. Now, I give a shit. I can't honestly
say that I want to raise another child, so I am not about to take
a crapshot."


They were reprising the original battle, still causing pain, but
also speaking more clearly, more fully. I noted that although it
was a very uncomfortable impasse, it was an impasse caused by
the interference of changes for the better. Daphne had lived
her life in an overcontrolled way. Throwing caution to the wind
could be salutary. Karl, however, wanted to go in the opposite
direction. Both were moving toward "health," but each in a
way that appeared impossible for the other.


Karl said, "I was going to say we're back to square one. Yet
it can't be. Because we're talking more. We're more sad now
than pissed off."


I reminded them that change didn't move in straight lines,
and that they might need to cycle through this issue a few more
times.


By the next session, they were absorbed with their plans to
travel to Florida in March. Daphne was nervous, not about the
flight, nor about the care of Rosie, who would stay with her
aunt Melina, but about her own feelings of taking off alone
without her.

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl described a similar feeling. He said that when they went
to the mall for two hours, leaving her with a sitter, Rosie would
greet them like they had been gone for a month. "I'll be down
there knowing she's asking for us, and I'm afraid it will make <i>me
</i>nuts. Four days is a long time."


We devoted the session to exploring this shared dread.
There was a feeling of terrible loss, of something slipping away
that could never come back. Daphne smiled, thinking of a
dream she had had. It was a bit silly, but she felt she knew its
meaning, without consulting Karl or me.


<i>I dreamed my father was making mashed potatoes. Then he
was doing what my daughter used to do for laughs—emptying
the bowl on his head</i>.


For Daphne the meaning was clear. The dream substituted a
baby for a father. If she had another child, especially a boy, it
would replace him.


"Bringing a new life into this world makes up for so much
that is bad, so much pain. Suddenly, someone depends on you
totally. With everyone else getting old and losing their functions,
you bring this being into the world who only gets more beautiful
every day and more capable. It makes you feel godlike. It's
like cheating death."


Karl shook his head, admiring her bumptious eloquence.


Daphne continued. She had always hated it when her
mother went away. She began to weep, and I remembered that
years back, she had told of a number of separations from her
mother. They were not for vacation purposes. Her mother had
been ill throughout her childhood, and had undergone several
operations, including a hysterectomy at the age of thirty-six.
Daphne would wake up in the morning, asking for her mother,

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He couldn't comfort the children, we decided, because he himself
was having a hard time with her absence. He was dependent
on her for everything, and was probably terrified of her dying.


Karl, too, had experienced his mother's absence at a young
age. There were times when his father "got physical" and
started to push or slap her. On several occasions, she chose to
leave the house and spend the night with a relative. No one explained
these absences to Karl. He could not express his fear
or anger at being left behind with "the ogre." Like Daphne, he
wondered if he might get left behind for good.


The memories filling the room made it easy for me to make
sense of their fears about leaving Rosie home for a long weekend.
They were projecting their anxieties onto Rosie, assuming
that she would feel what they had felt when left behind. My explanation
offered relief. Children often can sense the difference
between a situation in which parents are going away on
vacation and going away because of illness or victimization.


"It makes sense, what you're saying," said Karl. "We have to be
giving off a completely different vibe. Rosie knows we're OK."


They left the session laughing about how they hadn't needed
all that travel insurance after all. Daphne had asked her doctor
for some Valium, and now felt she wouldn't take it. A teetotaler,
she said she might, however, need to have a drink on the plane.


"It's been done before," I said, and wished them a wonder
ful holiday.


The day after their return, Karl and Daphne entered my office
tanned and relaxed, saying they had enjoyed every minute of

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Karl asked, "Ain't you gonna tell Deborah the other thing?"


"What other thing?"


"You know, that we're going to bed."


Whereupon they laughed uproariously. Yes, they had resumed
their sex life down in Miami Beach. She and Karl had
agreed to use condoms, realizing they were taking chances.


"I don't wanna be celibate the rest of my life," he said. "And
if we have another kid, so be it. We'll manage, I guess."


Daphne looked at him lovingly and reached out to hold his
hand. I asked for her thoughts and she said she had noticed her
desire for a second child diminish while they were away. When
I asked her to explain, she was quick to say she wasn't ready
to give up that part of her life. But she no longer felt the need
to rush out and get pregnant. She was grateful for their happiness
and did not want to jeopardize it. And despite his faults,
there was so much about Karl she enjoyed.


"He is loyal. He is the kind of man who could spend four
days on a beach surrounded by twenty year-olds in bikinis and
still make you feel <i>you</i> are the one he's looking at. He looked
great with his big muscles, walking into the ocean. I would
catch him looking at me, and even that would get me going.
... And I have to say one more thing, you know, because my
family was ridiculous about sex, and I felt so uptight as a young
woman. I expected sex to be a burden, a wifely duty. But Karl
... made sex wonderful tor me."


I looked at him, fully expecting him to shrug off the compliment,
or perhaps to thank her. He uncrossed his arms, studied
the floor and said softly:

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"She did, too. She made sex wonderful for me, too."


Karl started the next session by bringing up the chore wars. He
did more housework than most guys, and still she didn't appreciate
it. She had to supervise, analyze, criticize everything he
cleaned or cooked. Daphne didn't deny it. She turned to him
and tried to explain that although he did a lot of actual work,
he did not do the "planning." It was she who ended up organizing
their trip: packing for them and for Rosie, confirming the
flights, arranging for someone to care for the dog.


I have heard many other wives and mothers express this
very thing. It's the mental energy involved in thinking ahead
about the household and everyone in it that is onerous.
Daphne gave examples of times she had backed off, only to
have important things left undone.


They devoted three sessions to this issue. They were really
listening to each other this time, teasing more and blaming
less. The resolution they came up with by the end of the third
session seemed fair and workable. It was during the end of:
this session that their smiles of satisfaction led to a long silence.
It lasted perhaps ten minutes—a therapy eternity. I
hesitated to speak because the silence felt chosen and pleasurable.
Some therapists believe that the very goal of this kind of
work is to increase the family's or the couple's capacity for reflection,
for "reverie." This was a pregnant pause, I thought.
And I followed my own train of associations....


Sitting there, I realized what was going to happen: they
were going to have another child. They had used therapy to
clear a psychological space for a new baby. She had been desperate
to have a son, in order not to lose what Karl couldn't

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A baby would be lucky to come into this family in which
people could listen and talk, in which extended family members
were cared for, in which people made each other laugh
and interpreted each other's dreams.


As we were nearly out of time, I broke the silence, asking if
either one of them wanted to say anything. Daphne said
calmly, without looking up:


"I start working May tenth."


There had been no preamble to this news. Daphne had simply
found a part-time job as the receptionist in an office. She seemed
pleased. She hastened to say that this did not mean she would
never have another child. It simply wasn't on her mind these days.


So much for my clinical intuition! Sometimes a pregnant
pause is only a pregnant pause.


I asked if she knew why she wasn't "obsessed" any more.


"I really couldn't say," she replied. "But I feel much better. I
hated that feeling. It was like going crazy."


It was late April when we said good-bye. Daphne remarked: "I
have such a different feeling saying good-bye to you this time.
The last time I felt terribly sad—that I would miss you awfully.
But this feels natural. I don't know. I suppose if we get in trouble

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was touched by her thoughts, both about being ready to
leave me behind and also about feeling empowered to find me
if necessary—indeed, to "jet out" for a session.


Karl's eyes welled with tears as he thanked me.


"It sounds sappy to say: ‘Thank you for saving my marriage.’"


It sounded lovely.


We shook hands. They promised to drop me a card in the fall.


Four months later, Daphne called about an insurance form.
She was eager to tell me she had quit her first job for a second,
better one. She was now the receptionist in a large law office. So
pleased were the partners with her performance, they were offering
to train her as a paralegal. Karl picked up the extension:


"Deborah, this is the most perfect job for her. Get a load of
this: She's learning all this legal knowledge and boosting her
confidence. She's nicer to Rosie, too."


Was there anything in it for him?


"It's like watching <i>L.A. Law</i> to hear her talk about her day.
And I like having the extra dough, too."


I couldn't help asking if they were still considering another
child. Daphne answered first:


"Definitely not. I can't even remember why I wanted to
do it."


I was very curious about how she herself understood the
change in her desire. She had, not so long before, insisted on
the right to be "obsessed."


"What changed your mind, Daphne? Do you know?"


"It's Karl." she said. "He's my friend, now. I'm not lonely
anymore."

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387554-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They told me that they still told their dreams to each other,
something a lot of couples continue to do after therapy. They
mentioned that Karl had done well in a weight lifting competi
tion at his gym.


Working out and watching television were still his only hob
hies, which continued to disappoint Daphne. He simply would
not get interested in her version of culture.


Therapy had not made quarreling obsolete. They still bick
ered about the old things, they said, and just as passionately.


Porcupine love such as theirs is at least never dull!


The Loebs, I imagined, would always be both tender and
prickly. They loved each other, but not as "kindred souls" do.
She liked discussing world news; he felt the family was world
enough. She ached for a trip to Europe; he, for more time in
the den. They were mismatched, and content to be.


Same bed, different dreams.
