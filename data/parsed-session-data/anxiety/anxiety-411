We all think egocentricly. "I am the only person who has
ever felt this way." "I am the only person who has suffered
like this." "I have to bear burdens that no one else bears."
You are right too, in many respects. Only you can ever know
what it means to feel just as you feel now. Only you will
ever have experienced the terror and despair of the loss of
love and care. Only you can know the feelings of hate and
anguish, of love and hostility, or anxiety and peace that can
exist at the same time in you, directed toward someone you
value more dearly than physical life itself. As Kierkegaard
puts it in his book, <i>The Concept of Dread</i>:
<blockquote>
<p>
But although there have lived countless millions of such
"selves," no science can state what the self is, without stating
it in perfectly general terms. And this is the wonderful
thing about life, that every man who gives heed to himself
knows what no science knows, since he knows what he
himself is.

"selves," no science can state what the self is, without stating

thing about life, that every man who gives heed to himself
knows what no science knows, since he knows what he

Other people have these emotions, in similar degrees and

We share some moments freely with others, but some of
our moments cannot be shared, no matter how much we
would like to. Eventually we face alone the most critical
moment of loneliness, our first awareness of the personal
certainty of death. But all through life we carry with us
those tiny bits of sinking uncertainty, those brief lonely
moments that we cannot share. Some people are apparently
fortunate enough to view these instances with a minimum
of anxiety. Others of us see them as terrifying shadows in
the dark recesses and crannies of our beings.


You have felt the kinds of emotions I am talking about
now. But it may never have occurred to you to look at what
I call the aura of humanness, namely loneliness, as an essential
characteristic of man. A characteristic shared by all persons,
and therefore by you and me.


It has been said that the major difference between man
and the animal is that man is aware of his "being" and
consequently is aware of the certainty of someday "not
being." It is this awareness with which we spend our lives
and for which we structure our world. C. P. Snow said it
well:
<blockquote>
<p>
the individual condition of each of us is tragic. Each of us
is alone; sometimes we escape from solitariness, through
love or affection or perhaps creative moments, but those
triumphs of life are pools of light we make for ourselves
while the edge of the road is black; each of us dies alone.

the individual condition of each of us is tragic. Each of us
is alone; sometimes we escape from solitariness, through
love or affection or perhaps creative moments, but those
triumphs of life are pools of light we make for ourselves
while the edge of the road is black; each of us dies alone.


Then the search for "the meaning of life," which so many
of us persist in, is doomed to fail. The existentialists, such
as Sartre, have said that life has no intrinsic meaning, that

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The discovery that we must give life its meaning can be,
and usually is, overwhelming and terrifying for many of us.
Yet this circumstance gives some people the opportunity to
give meaning to their lives by helping others cope with and
accept the "damning" human condition. These people call
themselves variously counselors, psychotherapists, ministers,
psychiatrists, psychologists, or perhaps mother, father,
teacher, friend. It should be pointed out, however, that not
all who are given these names are, except by vocational
accident, fully committed to their responsibilities or their
opportunities. Most of us have this task thrust upon us
because of our needs or because of our concern for someone
we care about deeply.


<b>Caretakers: good, bad, and indifferent</b>


Nearly everyone has the chance to develop a life "in his
own image." Most of us have an opportunity to shape and
mold another personality and to help it develop fully. Because
most of us are parents, whether we have children who
grow to be healthy and fully functioning beings or not is
partially under our control. Some of us will reap a harvest
of bitter disappointment and despair. A few parents will
have children who grow to adulthood in a crippled, malformed
fashion. Some of them will be crazy, some just
peculiar, some antisocial, and some a violent danger to other
people.

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the core of every neurosis, psychosis, or other emotional
or psychological malady is anxiety. This anxiety can
be exacerbated or soothed by life's circumstances. Whether
or not it culminates in an overt and uncontrollable disruption
of life functions depends on three factors: the constitutional
strength of the person; the severity and chronicity of
life stress; and the age at which unmastered stress was experienced.


The first factor, constitutional strength, is beyond our
control or mastery. None of us can select the gene pool from
which our organism will grow. If we are fortunate, we will
inherit a stable nervous system and a sound physiology. If
we do not, then we will be subject to the vicissitudes of
misfortune in our physical functioning, including our nervous
system, which may contribute heavily to our later inability
to master excitation, frustration, and neglect.


The other two life factors, severity and timing of stress,
are more open to modification. Although individuals cannot
usually control these factors for themselves in their own
lives, there are people in everyone's life who can.


Every child is born helpless. In his earlier days, his needs
are few and relatively simple. He needs food, he needs
water, and he needs warmth. There is growing evidence too
that he needs physical contact and sensory stimulation. Babies
who on occasion do not have these needs fulfilled react
to this deprivation with rage and an apparent primal panic.
If needs are met with relative promptness, rage and panic
never develop; and if they do develop, they are rapidly
extinguished.


As a baby grows, his needs for sustenance are expanded
to items and acts that are extensions of these basic physical
needs. Overt acts of love and caring are required to allay the
feelings of anticipatory anxiety the child has for demonstrations
of the continuing assurance that basic needs will be

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So it is from the basic needs for the literal requirements
of life-sustaining behaviors on the part of the baby's caretakers
that all of our emotional and psychological requirements
come. From this perspective then, you can see that
love, interest, caring, security, protection, control, direction,
sympathy, and a host of other reactions are equivalent, in
a primitive sense, to feeding, clothing, and sheltering. These
later emotional extensions of basic needs are merely elaborations
of the rudimentary life-sustaining physical requirements.


It is obvious then that the earlier disruptions or failures
to fulfill life needs are the most serious for the continued
growth of the child. And, of course, it is also evident that
they are the most difficult to treat therapeutically because
they form the basis on which psychological needs are elaborated
(love, sympathy, comfort, interest, and so on) and also
because they are relatively inaccessible, since they usually
occur in the preverbal phase of the baby's life.


If we can accept this brief and simplified formulation of
life's psychological development, then we can easily see
that an early deprivation of basic needs is more damaging
than a later one and that a mild deprivation of an early need
may be as damaging as a severe blow to the fulfillment of
later needs. "When" becomes more important than "how
much."


All of these needs, early and later ones, are fulfilled
through human ministrations. Food and water don't fall
into the baby's mouth. Somebody puts it there. Relief of
discomfort and secure warmth don't occur naturally. Somebody
provides them. And as a child grows, he knows in the

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>The primal fear</b>


These facts (at least what I hold to be facts) establish the
contention I maintain that the loss of life's protectors and
providers is the most feared, most traumatic possibility in
anyone's existence, and it is especially critical to the developing
child. The loss of a protector (parent), then, is equivalent
to the loss of one's own life. Psychoanalytically, to be
neglected or discarded or abandoned by one's parents is
equivalent to impending death. This possibility constitutes
the core of anxiety for every child. He fears most of all the
possibility of being abandoned in a world which will not
supply his life's needs. This is why a four-year-old who is
accidentally separated from his mother in a department
store reacts with such primal panic. The unconscious specter
of abandonment overwhelms him.


A child who does not have his basic needs met cannot
grow with strength and certainty through the successive
developmental periods of his life. Rosen in <i>Direct Analysis</i>
puts it this way: "A child has to grow. If it has a parent
suffering from a perverted maternal instinct, the child from
the start must build on a weakened psychosexual base.
Thereafter, at each critical period in development, the child
will be shaken."


Most children, even those severely stressed, struggle on
moderately successfully through successive developmental
periods, although they may show clear signs of emotional
distress. However, each succeeding period intensifies this
stress. And, as Rosen explains, after years of stress and
coping, the crippled child succumbs to a neurosis or even A

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So you can see that the parent who threatens a child with
loss of love, either overtly or covertly, is evoking the most
basic kind of terror that is possible. And the actual loss of
a parent, through death, divorce, or psychological disability,
is the most dreadful possibility in a child's life.


The parent who "holds back" from his child or fails to
manifest his loving care causes the child to feel the threat
of the loss of life needs and cripples him with the burden
of chronic anxiety.


I do not believe that this formulation of the basic roots
of psychological development is overdrawn or unnecessarily
dramatic. It certainly applied absolutely in my life, and
again and again in my practice as a psychologist I see children
who manifest clearly their feeling of anxiety over the
threat of abandonment.


One little boy of five was brought to me by his mother,
a rather prim and stern lady, because he was having "seizures"
in his sleep. He would scream and convulse his body
and seem to be out of contact for ten to fifteen minutes with
each episode. The attacks were occurring more frequently
now, almost nightly. The neurologist could find nothing
physically wrong with his nervous system.


I suspected night terrors from the description of the attacks
given by his mother.


"Is John an angry boy?" I asked. "Does he fight with his
friends frequently? Is he rebellious and resistive to you and
your husband? What does his teacher think about him in
kindergarten?"


John's mother reported that he did fight with other children
at home and at school and that he had few friends
because of his aggressive and hostile manner. "But," she
said in a perplexed way, "he's like a different boy at home.

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I asked if he ever ventured to "sass" or "buck" her or her
husband. She replied in a stern, jaw-set voice, "He knows
better than to try."


My play sessions with John revolved around the family
members and interaction with them. His play was pedestrian
and unremarkable until I introduced the theme of rebellion
on the part of the boy doll. John was visibly
shocked. When I had the boy shout to his father, "No, I
won't do it! And I hate you because you're mean!" John
nearly fell out of his chair in astonishment. In subsequent
play sessions John spent the entire hour acting out themes
of aggression and conflict between mother, father, and son.
Finally, he even had a physical battle going on between
them, which, incidentally, the boy won!


In about six weeks the night terrors disappeared. His
mother was happy, but she was concerned that John was
getting to be a little "lippy," as she put it.


It seems clear that John had occasional intense feelings of
hostility and rage toward his mother and father, which is
natural, since every "normal" child has periods of alternating
hate and love for his parents. However, John's parents
tolerated no evidence of hostility from their child. I don't
know what they did that made him repress these feelings.
However, I imagine that they conveyed subtly, through
their stern, cold, demanding manner, that John faced the
possibility of lost love if he didn't curb his feelings. Consequently,
John's fear of the feelings of hate exploded in
unguarded moments in sleep in the form of terrifying nightmares.


Remnants of childish feelings about aggression, authority
(parental love), and the possibility of loss of love are present
in every one of us, no matter how old or mature we may be.
If these feelings were handled in a healthy way during our

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This is why acts of independence have been so traumatic
for me. Of course, stages of increasing independence carry
with them the corollary of less support and less caring from
the people who give us our emotional sustenance. Now it is
easy for me to understand why going to college, joining the
armed forces, getting married, and earning a doctorate were
periods of such severe stress for me. They represented decreases
in support and increased expectations of independence.


The saddest thing about this whole matter is that immature,
unsatisfied people (like I was?) have children and cannot
"feed" them the emotional fare they need to master
their own development. On the contrary, some of these
parents try to get their children to "feed" them instead. And
so the circle of hungry despair is unbroken.


<b>Is there really a Santa Claus?</b>


I suppose that everybody, no matter how old, harbors in
his secret and deepest feeling the hope that there really is
some magic in the world. "Perhaps," we whisper to ourselves,
"events are not really determined." "Maybe, just for
me, nature's laws can be overruled." "Perhaps lady luck will
rest her hand on my shoulder and I will receive unexpected
and unearned riches and blessings." "Somehow, just this
once, I will not have to pay in life's coin for what I get, or
don't get." "This time I may not have to work for my
supper. Somehow, somewhere, just maybe I won't have to
pay the going price for what I want."


No matter how mature we are, we still carry remnants of

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As we grow older we learn that things don't really just
happen; someone or something causes them to happen. We
get our help from others or we earn our rewards and fulfill
our needs through our own efforts. In other words, we pay
by our actions for the things we get. We learn also that
sometimes we must wait, even though we want something
badly. Or we even learn to tolerate the idea that we may not
get what we want at all. We learn to endure pain and to
tolerate discomfort and disappointment. Most importantly,
we discover that we must actively work to get what we
need, be it objects like cars and refrigerators and food, or
emotional sustenance like love and companionship. But in
our heart of hearts we still maintain vestiges of the hope
that the conditions of our childhood will come again, and
we will be succored and cared for whether we do anything
for ourselves or not.


Of course, most of us recognize the childish appeal of
these feelings and indulge in them in a half playful way by
such actions as buying a lottery ticket or "knocking on
wood" or "wishing on a star." When we are tired or disappointed
or afraid, we may daydream and fantasize even
though we know full well that we really are adults and that
our fears and hopes will not be quieted or resolved by any
miracle. The less mature among us continue to believe that
magic will solve our problems of living, and that somehow,
through no effort on our part, our trials and tribulations will
be eased. Such people are not tolerant of delay. They want
what they want now. They feel that other people should

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A number of industries have grown up around the adult's
remnants in his personality structure of childish needs.
These industries exist to gratify our inability to tolerate
delay and to soothe our resentment over the demands of
nature for effort in exchange for gratification. Some of the
more unimportant evidences of this are seen in our propensity
for instant service. We have instant coffee and minute
rice and quickie divorce. We have blue stamps, red stamps,
and green stamps, all of which suggest something for nothing.
We have fortune tellers, astrologers, and horoscopes.
We ask for special evidence of unusual favor from these
kinds of people, and some of us even believe that they may
know the secrets that will enable us to recapture the magic
we once had.


At a more sophisticated level we find the "wish for magic"
phenomenon periodically renewed in what we would
normally consider to be scientific, rational, objective people.
As evidence of the continuing power of this phenomenon,
even in professional people, we find serious consideration of
such things as psychic powers, extrasensory perception, sorcery,
and witchcraft. And then, blending into the realm of
objective evidence and rationality, we find a serious involvement
of otherwise mature people in meditation, yoga,
and drug trips.


<b>Freedom found</b>


For instance, just recently a lady came into my office to
seek support for a proposed "research" project. She introduced

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I indicated that I knew little of meditation and had
no great interest in it, I immediately saw that I had made a
serious mistake. This calm, open, friendly woman berated
me at length for my narrowminded rigidity. She questioned
my competency, my integrity, and my ancestry. When she
left me, she was a seething, burning, offended "true believer."
If I had not known better, I would have thought I
was talking to an angry, hostile, rigid person.


Such people want something for nothing. In this case, she
wants peace of mind and psychological security without
paying the price of working to know and to understand
others and their needs and herself and her needs. She wants
peace at bargain basement prices. This phenomenon is seen
with encounter group adults who believe that one night of
"open" expression of their feelings and toleration of others
will bring instant nirvana.


The old hope for magic surfaces again and again. "By
chanting some secret incantations and achieving a oneness
with my mind, I'll be free of the frustrations that beset my
life." Or, "One nude marathon group focusing on my hopes
and fears will free me of my hate and despair." "Could it
be that drugs will introduce me to a new state of consciousness
where I can see new beauty and a new kind of truth?"


Even scientists are subject to abandoning their science if
they can delude themselves that magic is still a possibility.
Witness the current interest in acupuncture by physicians.

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

True, one must look inward. But one must be willing to
take what is found and use it in life's living. The real mastery
over life will come to those who take their suffering and
fears into the world and who deal with them realistically
from the time they rise in the morning till they lie down at
night. We must confront and challenge our secret fears. We
must endure our frustrations and refuse to visit them on
others. If we are free and open, we don't have to tell everyone
about it. They will know it. And if we must exercise our
independence and freedom, we don't have to grow hair to
our waist to prove it. Freedom lies between the ears, not
above or below or outside of them.


If we are free, we can permit others to be in bondage if
they insist on it. If we are at peace, we can grant others the
right to be in turmoil. If we have no fear, then we cannot
be afraid of those who don't believe as we do. Most important
of all, if we are loving, we can foster love in those close
to us.


<b>Childish needs and childish ways</b>


I cannot document or otherwise prove that my contentions
regarding the lifelong effects of childhood deprivation
or trauma are universally true. Perhaps they are not. I know
only that such has been the case in my life.


As I look back on the psychic scars left by the loss of my

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Each of my depressive periods coincided with an instance
when I had to extend myself beyond my family and "act
like a man." For example, I can recall vividly the difficulties
I experienced when I left for college, went into the navy,
accepted my first professional job, got married, entered a
doctoral program, and reached the point of postdoctoral
employment.


From this vantage point, it is easy for me to see that each
of these instances was an occasion when I "left the nest."
Psychologically I reacted to them as abandonment and loss
of nurturance and protection. The more mature and demanding
the occasion, the more traumatically I reacted.
Emotionally I always felt as if I were alone in a hostile
world. I had the gut feeling that I would be left to die. My
reaction was cataclysmic and panicky. I could not be consoled
or reassured. Deep inside I was afraid and tortured by
a primal, indefinable dread of destruction and loneliness.


This reaction was characterized--prosaically, I thought--
by the psychiatrist at the hospital as due to unresolved
dependency needs. That sounds so innocuous and scientific
that it's no wonder it made no particular sense to me then.
It surely does now. Now I know that "unresolved dependency
needs" can culminate in a raging turmoil of panicky
depression and desperation and that the color of our life's
fabric will be determined by our success or failure to recognize
and live with the unmet needs of childhood. It is indeed
a fact that "the child is father of the man." The further
away I get in time and psychological distance from this

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We all have remnants of these feelings and fears in our
lives. Some have more than remnants. But even those of us
who are reasonably "normal" experience something of
these emotions when we lose a friend or relative to death,
or when we are forced to move to a new town and give up
our familiar surroundings and our colleagues and acquaintances.
This primal reactivation of childhood needs makes
a job loss in middle life a devastating experience for some
people. And it is not the threat of economic loss alone that
accounts for our reactions to being fired or laid off. We see
similar reactions in people who have to retire. Many of them
respond as if they were abandoned and lost. The folklore
regarding the rate of premature deaths in retired persons is
a documented truth. Suicide is common in older people who
no longer have the security and protection of a job and the
comfort of relationships with fellow workers and business
friends.


Most of us never consciously recognize such fears, much
less connect them to childhood frustrations. Instead, we
rebel against our feelings in nonproductive and indirect
ways. We drink too much and party too long. We work too
hard and too compulsively, or conversely, we find it difficult
to work at all. We malign and antagonize those we work
with. We are resistive and passive, or hostile and uncooperative.
Of course these feelings spill over into our relationships
with our families and friends; we are impatient with
them and intolerant of their needs and welfare. We are
short-tempered, ill-natured, and sometimes physically and
psychologically abusive. In short, we act like tired, fearful,
petulant children. In reality, that's what we are.
