<b>DR:</b> Okay, [PATIENT NAME], how have you been doing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, okay.  Ah, some days bad, some days good.  Uh, I'm trying to be in control.  Um, my son needs me a lot right now.
<b>DR:</b> What's going on?
<b>PT:</b> He's trying to get into rehab.  He also got jumped on and beat up really bad.  And we needed to go to the hospital and things for that.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> What kind of rehab?  What is he on?
<b>PT:</b> He, he was doing, um, he had started to, uh, experimenting with crack.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> Um, but he has seizures, so he also takes Tegretol.  So, um, and since he has gotten beat up, my rule with my children was that if you ever need a ride home, I'll come and get you.  I'll always come and get you.  Um, I won't take you to places, but I'll come and get you.  And, um, he, since he's gotten beat up, I now take him where he wants to go, and I pick him up because he can't drive because of his seizures.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So he calls me sometimes at 12:00 and 1:00 and 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.  And I go get him.
<b>DR:</b> Where does he go that late time?
<b>PT:</b> He stay, um, some friends of his.  He stays with some friends, um, and goes up, and I don't know what he does up there, honestly.  He just goes, it's like, some apartments up, not too far from where I live.
<b>DR:</b> Wait a minute.  You let, he lives with you?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> And he goes like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How old is he, you say?
<b>PT:</b> 21.  He's 21.
<b>DR:</b> And you don't know what he's doing?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you, you do go pick him up every ni, every night, you say.
<b>PT:</b> Every night.  I pick him up every night.
<b>DR:</b> No.  You got to put some kind of boundary.
<b>PT:</b> Every night.  I, I, I think I, I'm trying to do it until, until maybe he can get into rehab.  You know, it's, it, it's difficult.  I don't know how to explain, um, he, you know, my husband had drug problems.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> You know, we discussed that.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I was always there for him.  You know what, I, I always stood behind him and knew who he was inside, you know?  And I always try to look for the good.  And, um, and I feel like I, I almost feel like I owe my son the same thing.  You know, that I owed for him to be there and try to give him a chance.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> So has he been already accepted in some kind of -
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he has.  He's supposed to go, we had, we had hoped he was going sooner, but we're having issues with some of the doctors and all these things.  Um, but she called me and said that he, the soonest they're gonna take him is [DATE], which just really, yester, she told me that yesterday, and it really brought me down a lot because I was hoping sooner, ah, so I could rest a little.
<b>DR:</b> With your depression, that's no good.  You been not taking medicine, are you?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I've been taking the, I still have the Zoloft.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> You've been taking them, though?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How many do you take?
<b>PT:</b> Um, 1.  I take 100 mg once a day.
<b>DR:</b> You're supposed to take 2.
<b>PT:</b> I only take 100 1, yeah, once a day.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> That's, ah, that was the last prescription that you gave me.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.  Hello?  Hello?  Sorry.
<b>PT:</b> That's okay.  Um, and the Klonopin, I don't know if it's just everything with me, you know, or whatever, but I don't know, I just don't feel, I feel like, I don't know, I'm really, I'm still real anxious, um, very nervous.
<b>DR:</b> With all this happening.  How are your daughters doing?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my daughters are doing fine.  Um, the oldest 1 is back in s, you know, they, my oldest 1 is going, she goes to [DEINDENTIFIED].  And she's got, maybe, 2 semesters left.
<b>DR:</b> Good.
<b>PT:</b> Um, because she's a biology major, so.  And the youngest 1, this is her second semester.  I mean she's still moving, you know, she still moves out.  And I'm trying to learn, I don't want to say accept because I don't like, I don't like her boyfriend.  I don't like him.  He doesn't treat, he doesn't treat her the right way he should.  Um, but, you know, there's nothing I can do.  And so I have had him come over a couple of times, you know, like to eat or something.  You know, I'm trying to be ni, you know, because inside, in my heart because of my faith, you know, I'm supposed to, to reach out to people.  But in my mind, ha, I don't like him.  And I don't like what he's, what he stands for or who he is.  And he, he doesn't believe in any faith at all.  He believes totally in science, which, you know, lu, I, I just, I don't know.  It's just hard for me.  It's hard.  I, I'm trying to be, maybe I'm trying to be the person I need to be, and I haven't succeeded.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you look so depressed, and you're crying.
<b>PT:</b> Aha.
<b>DR:</b> And -
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I wasn't gonna cry.  I was just coming to get medication.
<b>DR:</b> No, that's okay.  I mean, you know, what I'm saying is -
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> We haven't seen you since November, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes ma'am.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And ah -
<b>PT:</b> I also had a cousin, um, I don't know if you heard about the accident on [DEINDENTIFIED] or the lady that got ran over?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> That was, is actually my brother's cousin.
<b>DR:</b> Mmm.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.  She got run over the other day.  Um -
<b>DR:</b> Your brother's cousin?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, we have different fathers.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, so it's his cousin on his father's side.  Um, you know, I don't know, I haven't seen her in, my oldest is 24, so I haven't seen her in 24 years, but it was just sad.  You know, it just, it just made me feel real sad, so, because she also was into drugs, and, and it's so difficult.  The drugs make me so angry.
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> You know, because I don't understand why people do those.  I just don't understand.
<b>DR:</b> It hits, it hits more home because your son is in it -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So that makes it even hard for you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  You know, and I get mad sometimes because I think, you know, I gave birth naturally 3 times so my children could come into the world with no drugs, no anything in their systems.  I've never done drugs, and yet, you know, my son is being retarded.  Um, I, I'm getting, I don't, that's not how you say it.  I don't want to be around people anymore.  Um, we had to go, my husband does Bible study, and once in a while they get together, like, with their wives, and we had to do that.  It's very nice.  Normally I enjoy it because it's adults only, and, you know, we, we talk.  And then they bring people in to sing.  It, it's very, very relaxing.  Um, this time was, I was miserable, didn't want to go.  Went anyway and was totally miserable.  Um, I don't know.  I just, I, I'm getting to where I don't really want to go anywhere out of my house.  I feel like that's my whole safety zone.  You know, I get up in the middle of the night, or whatever, and I go get my son, and then I come back home.  And that's kind of where I go, and that's it.  I don't really go anywhere else, and, you know, or anything like that.  I just stay there, and that's where I want to be.  Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to do the things around the house, cooking and cleaning and -
<b>PT:</b> I coo, yeah, I cook.  I cook all the time.  And I still take care of the ba, of the little girl that I watch, the baby.  Um, she makes me calm, you know?  I'm calm wi, around her.
<b>DR:</b> Whose baby is that?
<b>PT:</b> It's my cousin's granddaughter.  I'm calm around her, you know, because I want her to be calm.  You know, she's 20 months old, and she doesn't have, she doesn't know what's going on.  And she doesn't have to know.  You know, she's just an innocent child, and she deserves to have peace, you know?  And that's what I try to give her.
<b>DR:</b> And how are you sleeping with all this depression and -
<b>PT:</b> Um, I don't sleep.  Hm.  I fall asleep very fast.  The Klonopin is, make me sleep fast, um, like, maybe 30 minutes after I take it, I go to sleep.  But, like, an hour, I'm wide-awake again.  And then I'll get up or move around, go to sle, or these thoughts come in my head.  You know, sometimes, and I'm having, you know, the panic attacks again.  And, um -
<b>DR:</b> What thoughts?  What do you mean?
<b>PT:</b> Like, uh, sometimes I think about what would happen if I died, you know?  Or what if, what would happen if I died, and -
<b>DR:</b> You're not thinking about killing yourself?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, no, no.  No.  I, I, I wouldn't, I don't think I would ever do that because that would bring more pain to everybody else.  You know what I'm saying?  It's, it would be easy for m, an easy way out for me, but it would be pain for everybody else.  And I don't want to cause that pain to people.  You know, I would never do that.  Um, you know, and, and just things, you know, like that.  Just trying to deal with, with things going on and stay in control.  I have to stay in control because I feel like if I don't stay in control, if I break, I'm gonna break bad.  That's how I feel.  That if I break and don't stay in control, I'll break bad.
<b>DR:</b> That's a lot of pressure on you.
<b>PT:</b> [CRYING].
<b>DR:</b> Where is your husband?  Where does your husband fit in all this?  Does he help you out?
<b>PT:</b> Um -
<b>DR:</b> What's going on with him?
<b>PT:</b> My hu, see, it's kind of hard, you know.  I've been on the side.  I've been the person who has had to watch the person that I love do drugs and act stupid.  You know, so I, it's like, I hate to say it, but I have more experience.  My husband has never been on this side of it.  You know, it, it's difficult for my husband to watch his son do the stupid things that he's done.  You know, he doesn't deal with that well.  Um, so I kind of have to handle all.
<b>DR:</b> Well, at least have him, he can go and pick him up at night.  There's nothing wrong in -
<b>PT:</b> He won't.  He says he won't.  He's not going to pick him up.  He's, or anything.  He don't, you know, and, and he goes to sleep.  I mean, he takes medication, too.  He, um -
<b>DR:</b> Wait a minute.  But [PATIENT NAME], I just don't like the idea about you letting him go.  You don't know where he goes.  And you go pick him up every night at 4:00?  There's something is wrong.
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> Is this kid working?
<b>PT:</b> He can't work yet.  He has to, because of his seizures -
<b>DR:</b> Then what does he do all day?
<b>PT:</b> He, he sleeps.  Or he gets it, like; he got up this morning about 9:30, 9:30, 10:00.  And then he, he goes with his friends.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.
<b>PT:</b> You know, and then he, he's gone with his friends.  And he's actually at the some apartments that my youngest daughter lives at.  You know, he has friends that live in those apartments.  And they sit there, and they watch TV, and I don't know what all they do, honestly.
<b>DR:</b> Drugs.
<b>PT:</b> I su, that's, that's what I'm saying -
<b>DR:</b> Come on, what do you mean you don't have a -
<b>PT:</b> Well, I, I -
<b>DR:</b> I know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  An, but sometimes he comes, when he comes home, though, I don't know if he's already come off of the drugs, because he's not high when I pick him up.
<b>DR:</b> You know what?  I understand -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And you are putting all your 100% in this rehab that is going to go.  Now, how many times your husband has relapsed?
<b>PT:</b> My husband?  Um, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> What makes you so sure that you can let him do the drugs now, and then come [DATE] or whenever that is, boom, the miracle.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I'm ho, I'm hoping, I don't, well, I know he's not doing crack any longer.  He is smoking weed.  But I'm hoping and praying with all that I have that he'll - he wants to go and get away, and I talked to his counselor.  He talks to a counselor -
<b>DR:</b> He wants to get away from drugs?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And into -
<b>PT:</b> He, and the people.  All his little people are on, yeah, he -
<b>DR:</b> But he still goes every day.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  Every day.  Every day.  Same people.  And, and that's why I'm like, that's why I get confused, and I, I don't know what to do, but if I don't pick him up, and something happens -
<b>DR:</b> I know.
<b>PT:</b> I would not be able to live with it.  I won't handle it.  Um, so that's all, you know, he's just, and that's why I do it.  Because I know that if something happened, I would, I would blame myself forever.  So, um, but he, and I talked to his counselor.  She's a very nice lady.  Um, you know, she talks with me, and you know, she tells me that she feels like he really does want to stop everything he's doing, but he does need a way, like, a place away from it for a while.  So that's what we're working on.  I don't know.  He's going through [DEINDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Oh, he's in [DEINDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, he's in [DEINDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Is that the 1 who's going to -
<b>PT:</b> Yes.  They're going to get him into the, ah, rehab home.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, do you know where that is?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know where it is.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b> It's [DEINDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> I don't, I don't know where it is, but they -
<b>DR:</b> They've been through something like this.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, okay.  Yeah, but that's where he's going.  And like I said, we thought it was going to be, like, sooner.  But she called me and said it was going to be [DATE].  So, and it just, that just seemed like forever when she told me that yesterday, but, you know, but it's fine.  I'll survive.  You know, I survived worse, and I'll survive this.  And [CRYING].  You know, [INAUDIBLE].  You know, as long as he gets the help he needs, and, you know, can do right, and because he can't talk to his father.  He says that his father, I guess, I am so easy, and so col, you know, they just kind of, I don't know.  I listen to them.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And I don't judge them.  And I try to stay calm, um, you know, and then my husband is more, you know, aggressive.  And he doesn't hit them.  He doesn't do mean things to them.  But he just, you know, he gets louder.  He's from [DEINDENTIFIED], you know, so he gets loud.  And he's Puerto Rican, so.  But yeah, you know, he, and I have to kind of keep him calm, too.  So that's kind of adding a little stress on me, too, is I'm trying to keep him calm so they don't argue, you know, because if they argue, then it makes my son becomes more rebellious against his father.  And I don't want anything happen in that, in that aspect either, so -
<b>DR:</b> My goodness, you've been thinking too much.
<b>PT:</b> So, you know, it's -
<b>DR:</b> The peacemaker in the whole house.
<b>PT:</b> I, I, I've always been the peacemaker.
<b>DR:</b> And trying to -
<b>PT:</b> My whole life.
<b>DR:</b> Trying to protect everybody but you.
<b>PT:</b> [LAUGHING]
<b>DR:</b> Number 1, let me tell you 1 thing.  You've got to come here regularly, no matter what it take.  You got to take the medication just the way it's prescribed because all this, you, and you have been struggling you depression how long?
<b>PT:</b> Wow, forever.
<b>DR:</b> I know.  I've been -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, really forever.  Um, I just, I tried 1 time, a long time ago.  I went to the, um, what was it?  Oh, [DEINDENTIFIED] place?  I don't know, and talked to a lady 1 time.  But I talked with her once, and I really liked her.  And then I saw her a second time.  And the second time I saw her, she told me she was leaving.  You know, I was through with that.  You know, and I, I can't do that.
<b>DR:</b> But you, you can, you saw [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], and she's not -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that, uh-huh, I see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> You've been seeing her now?
<b>PT:</b> I have.  I still see her -
<b>DR:</b> Come and see her regularly because that's gonna help you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Because I've been seeing you for last 2 years -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> At least, for depression.  Right?  Going on [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Yes, ma'am.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> And even before then you were in treatment, so the thing is, I know you are under a lot of stress, and understandably, some of it is -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Ah, nowhere to go, and you are trying to protect everyone.  And that's is -
<b>PT:</b> But, t, that's just, that's, that's my whole life.  I've always done that, even as a child.  You know, I never - you know, I never knew my father.  You know, and I never asked my mother about it because I didn't want her to feel bad.  That's weird, right?  But I just, that's ju, I've always been that way, you know.  My grandmother used to tell me that I let people walk on me.  And I always wore my heart on my sleeve.  The, you know, that's just the way it is.  Un, I don't know, I don't know how to change it.
<b>DR:</b> Well, just let's get you going regular; take regularly medication.
<b>PT:</b> I will.
<b>DR:</b> Um, now let's see.  You've been, all the time you've been on Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> I think done bad on Zoloft.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Especially when you took 2.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Go back to your thing.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> In your chart, and when you were taking 2, you were doing much better with [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Number 1, you're going to continue taking the medicine.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>DR:</b> We need to bring your, no matter what it takes.  I can always call in your -
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
