BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Here we go.
CLIENT: Hey, I was really going to leave a [inaudible] [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Oh!
CLIENT: . . . don't usually do.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And I had to park like ten blocks away (breathless) 'cause I don't have one of the permits for [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Oh, so you were [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: . . . Hanover, 'cause I don't live in Hanvoer and [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Got ya. [inaudible at 00:00:15]
CLIENT: (Audible exhale) Yeah (other huffily chuckling), so (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Pretty harrowing parking around here or parking not quite around here (slight chuckle) more accurately.
CLIENT: Yeah, it was pretty hard to find a spot (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's more driving around in circles than I expected (chuckling) but [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Do you think you'll likely be driving here again? I mean I can tell you where I think you might have a shot at finding something, if that [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: That would be [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: . . . would help.
CLIENT: Yeah, it would.
THERAPIST: Okay. Sometimes you can find something at you know that little garage that's down on the end of (ph)? Right down Hayley Street here, there's a little covered like public parking garage.
CLIENT: Oh. [00:01:00]
THERAPIST: It only has probably 60 spaces in it or so, but sometimes you can find something in there.
CLIENT: Huh.
THERAPIST: Also, down Hayley or Philmont Street, like westward.
CLIENT: That's where I found something, was like way west on Philmont.
THERAPIST: Yeah. And if you want to risk it, like if you're just coming to an appointment here and you're not going to be here that long, one of the cross streets like Warwick, which is the one right by that little chalet-looking thing, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: . . . is probably hourly (ph) but like I wouldn't part there all day but I think you'd have pretty good odds if you were just there like an hour (both chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean you may not want to risk it, but [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: [inaudible]
THERAPIST: . . . another thing you can do is the garage across the street.
CLIENT: M-hmm. [00:02:00]
THERAPIST: I don't know how much it is to park there for an hour but it's probably like 10 bucks, which is nothing, but if you're like totally stuck (other chuckling) that is nothing, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: If I can think of anything else I'll let you know, okay.
CLIENT: Okay. Yeah you know I think I need to work on my, my strategy and leave a little earlier and make the circles part of the equation (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Well the other thing you can do, oh but that's really more for like all day, I used to sometimes park like in West Hanover, over by you know like where California Kitchen is, over there on West Ave.?
CLIENT: No, I don't know.
THERAPIST: It's far, it's like a mile away, but especially if the weather is nice you can often park there and just you can park there all day, so like if you have to walk in you'd be in the square (ph) frame like of time.
CLIENT: I won't say (barely audible) (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: But, yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, today I just didn't really feel like walking by the campus (huffing chuckle). [00:03:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah, I see (other laughing), yeah.
CLIENT: So well I drove more for that reason than any other.
THERAPIST: I see (other chuckling).
CLIENT: Um, but, oh man (pause), I am hung over today (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Oh, I, I got very stressed out about just sort of everything yesterday and had, had a bit too much to drink in the evening, hoping it would sort of help me work, but then I sort of went beyond the point of relaxing (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Got ya.
CLIENT: Oh man (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: How are you feeling?
CLIENT: Uh, (chuckling) I'm pretty, pretty out of it (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: Oh really?
CLIENT: [I think] (ph), yeah.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Yeah, I sort of had three-quarters of a bottle of wine and a couple of shots of Vodka and (chuckling), um, because I guess that I wasn't feeling like I was at that point of not being stressed out anymore (huffing chuckle). [00:04:14]
THERAPIST: I see, like you never got there you mean?
CLIENT: Yeah. But then, then I just got too drunk.
THERAPIST: Got ya (other chuckling).
CLIENT: You always hoped (ph), like you'll find the medium [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . and you won't just keep drinking and then, all of the sudden, more of it catches up to you (huffing chuckle) than had really [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: . . . kind of gradually shown itself [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . in the drinking process (chuckling), huh.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I think I follow.
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: How late were you up?
CLIENT: Till two or so (pause), um, but (pause) [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . yeah, it was strange. I, I had what seemed like a really good couple of days, like Sunday and Monday. [00:05:01]
Um, like one thing I've been struggling with is writing like longer chunks of the novel, um, 'cause I had chosen to write little bits of this and that here and there, from all over the place, which is not helping me get closer to the sort of Writers' Day deadlines which are coming up.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, so Monday I wrote a pretty long section that (audible breath) was, uh, chronologically in order, which [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: . . . was exciting, um, but, but parts of it didn't work. There was one part in the middle that I was really happy with, but other parts, like the sort of balance of like humor and pathos was not quite in, in the right proportions and the rhythm wasn't quite right (audible breath) and it was really bothering me because I couldn't figure out how to fix it (huffing chuckle). Um, (audible exhale) and I just became very frustrated because you know, even though I had done something that I had been sort of meaning to do and trying to do for a while, once I did it, it's not like that felt good (huffing chuckle). [00:06:09]
Um (pause), and I think it's always discouraging you, when you sort of meet one of your goals you've been working toward and it doesn't make you feel any better at all (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: Huh. So what did it feel like when you did?
CLIENT: (Sniffing) Initially, it felt good. And so like there was like a small period of time when I was like, oh look at this long chunk of writing I've produced this, you know today, like and you know I spent hours working on it (audible exhale), and after I finished it I tried to edit it, too, because I could tell it just wasn't quite gelling, except in the middle, but I couldn't figure out how to get the beginning and end into sort of the right arc and the right proportions. [00:07:00]
Um (pause), and (audible breath) I guess you know it's frustrating because with the novel I'll make goals for myself but I don't (pause) really know whether meeting them is going to get me anywhere, but within a very short-term sense. So it's like I don't know whether what I write tomorrow will be good and end up in the novel, and in the larger sense of like I don't know whether (chuckling) the novel will be good (questioningly).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: (Huffing chuckle) So I mean pretty much on every level it's just [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . filled with uncertainty.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um (pause), uh oh (chuckling).
THERAPIST: And, I see and that seems to relate to why it's hard to feel sort of good or a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment from doing what you set out to?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because there are some things where meeting a goal just is sort of unequivocally good. [00:08:03]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right, like a paper for class, you get it done and you hand it in.
CLIENT: And then it's out, clear (ph).
THERAPIST: It's clear how that relates to that piece of work, that class, the degree, I mean it's all lined up.
CLIENT: Yeah. And with this it's like no part of this project is going to be you know clear, um, or like there's no chance of getting any rewards from it for at least you know, I, I don't know how long (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and I was loo- [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: For at least an indeterminate period of time (both chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: [I guess that doesn't allow] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Who knows (chuckling)?
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and I was looking into the Writers Days, um, to get more detailed (ph).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And there were some that I didn't apply to because I just didn't have a long enough, really cohesive section, they'd had deadlines in January, and at first I had thought, oh that's you know [so I didn't apply] (ph). [00:09:07]
But then I was looking into what those Days actually, and like what the experience is, and bloggers were saying "don't go if you think you might be frustrated and intimidated that every other person has a Pulitzer or if you're going to have them publish it". I was like, "What?!"
THERAPIST: Oh my God.
CLIENT: "Why are these people going to Writers' Days?" It's like they have the money to rent their own cabin in those student woods (other chuckling), like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Hey.
CLIENT: . . . those take spots away from people who are [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . broke and just like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . trying to find time to get started (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um (pause), I mean I see the appeal for established writers; like it's fun to go talk to other writers I guess.
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: So, uh, it's not, it's, I guess I'm not totally shocked but it's not what I was expecting either (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like I thought these were more interested in sort of emerging writers than, than they actually are (chuckling). [00:10:02]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um (sniffing), so it seems like (audible breath) I'm just, there's you know a deadline for a point at which I'm going to get rejected from three things (other chuckling) in the near future, and like that's what I have to look forward to, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see, reassuring.
CLIENT: . . . like near certain rejection in the next like six weeks or eight weeks or whatever, (audible breath) and that's frustrating because I know it's going to feel bad, even though I'm not like getting my heart set on going because most of the people who go have already published a novel (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Uh oh.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And it seems like a long time before the next good thing is going to happen in my life.
THERAPIST: That's a problem.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and Jeff was saying I should try to you know see people here and try to focus on friendships and in the sense of doing work, um, but that doesn't even appeal to me (huffing chuckle). [00:11:05]
Like (huffing chuckle) it's not like there are these like fun things I want to be doing that I am preventing myself from doing so I can try to be thinking about writing or whatever, I just don't even want to do them (pause/frustrated sigh).
THERAPIST: Hmm. [Silence from [00:11:25] to 00:11:43]
CLIENT: Um, and starting Monday I'll have a lot of work [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . from this job, um, so I guess the next few days are sort of like a useless sample of my life, since it's this period that's sort of [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . unique and is about to be over (huffing chuckle), suddenly I'm coming to conclusions about what I should do, based on the last couple of weeks, is even going to be slow (ph) (chuckling) [overlapping voices] [00:12:09]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . [and since just] (ph) everything is about to change again.
THERAPIST: Right. Well I guess first, [with no sick leave] (ph), do we need to find a new time?
CLIENT: Uh, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . no, this one [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: . . . still works.
THERAPIST: Okay, okay.
CLIENT: So yeah, since [the schedule is for four] (ph).
THERAPIST: Okay, good, I just wondered [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah (sighing breath).
THERAPIST: . . . about that. [Silence from [00:12:28] to 00:12:39] Yeah, though [and you're going for your grade] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah (chuckling). Um (pause), and it, it kind of sucks because I (pause) thought that it would be great to have a writing project that I wanted to work on so much that I didn't even like want to socialize that much. You know I mean I wanted to like see Jeff. I always want to see Jeff, which is good, and I want to talk to Sue every now and then (chuckling). So (audible exhale) I mean it's a relief that I'm still somewhat human (laughing). [00:13:08]
THERAPIST: Yes (both laughing), good.
CLIENT: Um (pause), but I always thought it would be like so cool to care about something so much that nothing else really mattered (questioningly), but it's not actually like that cool (giggling).
THERAPIST: (Chuckling) That is pretty disappointing.
CLIENT: Yeah (pause), because that there's nothing like rewarding happening, based on this dedication to the novel. Um (pause), [silence from [00:13:40] to 00:13:49]
THERAPIST: I guess it sounds, to me, like a pretty big deal in that you had been, I think, really troubled by having to do work for other people, like [overlapping voices] [00:14:09]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: . . . with school, there was something really quite disturbing and dangerous about it; I think it's fair to say?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I guess I imagined that this sort of held all the promise that it did, at least at first, of the writing that you wanted to do, without the danger of having to show it to people [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: . . . before you wanted to? But it sounds like that it turned out that the other thing didn't work (other slight huffing chuckle).
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I wonder how much of my recent frustration is just based on trying to prepare to submit something to these Days that are, in all likelihood, going to reject me (giggling). [00:15:08]
Um, because before (pause) that deadline started to creep up, I was feeling much better about everything. Um, and I don't think the answer is that I shouldn't submit, although maybe it is, because just logistically, uh, like I really think I need to write one of the more dramatic scenes that I had been sort of putting off until I felt like I had written more about the characters in less crucial parts, um, and it just seemed like something I wanted to work up to. I wanted to work up [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . to the [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: . . . really dramatic parts [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . because those are the easiest to screw up.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: But (pause), like and I think, in order to send in a compelling sample, I really should write one of the important scenes (giggling) [overlapping voices] [00:16:01]
THERAPIST: I see, yeah.
CLIENT: . . . when dramatic things and conflicts [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . happens, not one of the sort of interludes, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . um, that sort of show the character's state of mind in some very every-day feel, a little context (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Sure, I think that's better for selling the work.
CLIENT: Yeah. Um, (sniffing) and it's, it's also making me sort of doubt the project in a way, just imagining someone seeing a small chunk of it, because I really do think much more like a novelist than like a, a poet or a short story writer, in that like I really have the whole context, in the before and after, in mind with each scene I write, and like I have the imagined resonances sort of, that won't be there [you know] (ph).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: I have to send in one ten-page sample, and one 20-page and one 40-page, 'cause they all have different requirements. [00:17:02]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um (pause), so (pause) and, and it's strange with, with the sort of interludes scenes that I've been primarily working on, um (pause), it's a question of, will the reader see what I am trying to show with this particular scene (huffing chuckle)? Like with fiction, it's much harder to predict how your audience will respond (questioningly). I mean when it's critical writing you know there's definitely a burden of proof but you very obviously prove things.
THERAPIST: M-hmm, (other huffily chuckling) yeah.
CLIENT: So I mean I think you know it's hard to sort of take your reader on the path you want them to go on but you're allowed to do it very obviously (chuckling).
THERAPIST: M-hmm, yeah. [00:18:01]
CLIENT: Um (pause), whereas with fiction (pause) I, I just hope some of the scenes I'm writing don't seem sort of random (chuckling), 'cause then none of them are random, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: . . . [meaning that] (ph) I, uh, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right, but without the rest of the novel around them (other huffily chuckling) you're wondering, [if at all] (ph), like how they'll come across to people?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, because the structure that I see in now is sort of there in, there is one like sort of dramatic arc, with like four different, um, the main character and like her relationships to four different people, and, and you know so that's sort of progressing linearly. But interspersed between the scenes, in which sort of the relationships change and conflict comes up, there are just scenes of her like going to the grocery store, cooking with her roommate, at work, um, like I wanted to infuse it with sort of the rhythm of, of every-day life and these sort of repetitive patterns in which the important things and preoccupation sort of subtlety come out and, and guide the way [overlapping voices] [00:19:14]
THERAPIST: All right, yeah.
CLIENT: . . . she sees the world. But, but without the longer arc, I'm worried that some of these scenes might [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: . . . seem a little bit pointless, I don't know (huffily chuckling), but maybe they won't, who knows? I, I, I don't know (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So (quietly nervous). [Silence from [00:19:31] to 00:19:59]
And it's just very risky, uh, really committing to this, this thing that only I will see for so long. Um, and you know, it's not like I, I expect to stop working on it when I get rejected from all of these groups. Um, it'll like lower my confidence but I'll still be working on it on my own. And (pause), I don't know, it's just sort of dismal to imagine the next year of my life (huffing chuckle) continuing in this fashion, (giggling) um, working on something that could just totally prove to be worthless (huffing chuckle). Not totally, I mean (pause) I'm somewhat enjoying writing it. But now it's almost more like (pause/audible breath) I, I feel anxious when I haven't worked on it, than like (pause), it's you know a little, slightly obsessional. [00:21:04]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, and something of a burden?
CLIENT: It's not a burden.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, good.
CLIENT: I mean I'm still like (pause) into it. It's just now that I'm serious about it it's not something I can sort of dabble in or [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: . . . feel like, oh I worked on my novel, well good for me (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Like [now there's a huge] (ph), seriously, if a day goes by [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: . . . when I don't work on it, it's like oh I didn't [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:21:33]
CLIENT: . . . work on my novel, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . bad for me (both laughing).
THERAPIST: I see, yeah, so there's that upside-down (ph), (other huffily chuckling) again (ph), yeah.
CLIENT: Oh (despondently). Um (pause), and I've been writing more in my journal, too, because I think that really helps me sort of (pause) think things through and it helps keep me from getting blocked, um (pause), and I think writing anything sort of helps with whatever else (chuckling) you're writing. [00:22:10]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: And just working with language is sort of like unilaterally of benefit (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh, I see.
CLIENT: Um (pause), and I was thinking [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . when I saw the longer chunk, when the tone just wasn't quite right, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . that maybe I should start, in addition to my regular journal (huffing chuckle), a third-person journal, like I used to keep, with sort of impressions of this and that from the day, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Oh, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: . . . with the third-person writing, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: . . . an everyday third-person journal.
CLIENT: . . . I did for [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: I believe I did, [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah (laughing)!
THERAPIST: . . . you did mention it, yeah.
CLIENT: Um, yeah, when I was working, uh, it was a (pause) full like moleskin journal in the third-person, because I was just sort of, I think this was when I had been working for (pause) six months or so, and was very disenchanted with my life at that time (chuckling). [00:23:09]
THERAPIST: Yeah, m-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I mean I sort of felt like I had no urgency and I was just being acted upon all the time, and so it seemed like sort of a joke to have a first-person journal (other chuckling) and say "I did this and I did that".
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Seeing that "I" just really bothered me because it felt like a joke.
THERAPIST: In that it was like almost a mockery of how little you felt urgency in the first place?
CLIENT: Yeah (sadly). Yeah, I mean the, the form and content seemed to be at odds, so and that I, also, just didn't feel free. [Silence from [00:23:49] to 00:24:05]
THERAPIST: And, I guess what struck me there is like, wait a minute, how could it be impossible to write a journal in the first person and have it feel genuine? In other words, I guess you must have felt pretty divorced from your own experience of your life at that point, except to feel it as being sort of, like I don't know, frustrating, difficult, pointless maybe?
CLIENT: Yeah, it did (sniffing).
THERAPIST: Like I guess I want to view that like if that's what you felt, why not write about that? I mean that's sort of what it was like.
CLIENT: Well but there are more than, there's more than one way to write about what it's like. [00:25:03]
THERAPIST: Sure (chuckling/other laughing)! But it sounds like the way you found to write about what it was actually like for you felt disingenuous or even like self-mocking?
CLIENT: (Pause) Yeah, I mean I just I couldn't reconcile the first-person voice with (pause) the disconnect I felt from myself.
THERAPIST: That's the piece that I guess I'm really struck by, that you felt so disconnected that there was no way to write about your own experience, from your own point of view, in a way that felt right.
CLIENT: Yeah; yeah (softly). Yeah, it's funny it went on for such a long time (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: The third-person journal? [00:26:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. And I had, um, you know I changed my own name and the names of other people. And when I first thought of it, I thought maybe I could, also, (pause) sort of (pause) go on little fictional tangents here and there, um, if I felt like it. And I didn't really end up doing that, but the way in which I wrote about my life was very different from (pause) you know any first-person journal I'd had in the past or would have in the future.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and I felt, for one thing, that working in an office was (pause) just imposing this really like unappealing (pause), you know visually, and in terms of energy in every other aspect, this very unappealing environment onto my life, and spending most of my time there defined me in a way I didn't want to be defined. [00:26:59]
So in the first part, especially, it's like just very attentive to scene; they'll describe like you know being on the, the Train and seeing the sunset over the mountains; or just like the bustle, people Christmas shopping in the malls. Um, and it's almost like I was trying to like suck in other like places and experiences, um, into my life because it had just sort of flattened out in a really (huffing chuckle) boring, unappealing way. [Silence from [00:27:35] to 00:28:14]
THERAPIST: You must have been pretty upset?
CLIENT: Yeah (soft). Yeah, I think just having these, um, sort of context, that didn't seem to fit together in any meaningful way, sort of made me feel very disjointed. Um, (sniffing) because you know the person I was at work was so different from the person I was outside work and, um (pause), I think that was sort of the first thing that inspired it. [00:28:55]
But then it continued to be useful because (pause), you know once I had feelings for Kevin and you know was still in a relationship with Seth, um, just having that huge like narrative that I just couldn't really share or acknowledge was a big burden, and having sort of a third-person journal (chuckling), but in which you know my name was different and his name was different, allowed me to work through that and be much more honest about it, than I think I would have in a first-person journal, at that time.
THERAPIST: Huh. [Silence from [00:29:34] to 00:29:40] I see, like by kind of disowning a little bit what was happening, you could acknowledge more of what was happening?
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think I was much more honest than I would've been, which is the reason I kept, uh, I kept writing in that way. [00:30:00]
THERAPIST: Do you know what would've made it more difficult to be honest in the first person?
CLIENT: Um, well there are a couple of things. There's always sort of the paranoia of having someone find it and read it but, also, you know I like to have a certain false image. And (pause), really like expressing things I'm feeling that I am not comfortable with, and having that in writing and having that just sort of present, like two pages, three pages, ten, behind whatever I'm writing, uh, afterwards sort of bothers me, I guess, because it makes it difficult for me to keep my positive conception of self and see myself the way I want to (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: I see. [00:31:00]
CLIENT: And it's different now, I mean I've become, I, I don't really hold back in my journals anymore. I think just having such a bad breakdown and turning to journaling is one way to work through that, um, just broke a lot of boundaries, that beforehand I, I still had a hard time like really getting into feelings I wasn't comfortable with. [Silence from [00:31:27] to 00:31:52]
THERAPIST: I see. [Silence from [00:31:53] to 00:32:25] I imagine it helps, in a way, to be able to write things now that are more directly how you feel. I mean it must be disturbing, at the same time, but helpful?
CLIENT: Yeah (pause), um (pause), yeah, I think that's one reason why, in the past, I was sort of looking for something impossible from (pause), you know from romantic relationships. I sort of wanted somebody who could bring that out of me and, um, in who I could believe, just totally, openly discuss my feeling with, and I think that made me sort of a volatile and needy person, in a way (questioningly). [00:33:11]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Um (pause), and now, having a word document, where I can (chuckling) see that person whenever (chuckling), and that that person is there, and I can like look back and there's more of that person (chuckling), um, sort of in this like easily accessible, physical location, uh, makes me a lot saner and calmer (huffing chuckle).
THERAPIST: [All right, yeah] (ph). [Silence from [00:33:43] to 00:33:58] [I think] (ph), yeah, that sounds like a pretty great change actually.
CLIENT: Yeah (pause), yeah and [maybe that's really] (ph) negative (chuckling) in ways, I mean and ev-, everyone is really but I'm tough. I've never encountered anyone who's like "yeah, I like to write in my diary and so I can write about all the wonderful things that happen in my life so I can remember them forever" (both chuckling), and usually that'd be a nice thing to do but no one seems to do it (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Um, so it's, it's like really nice having; it's like it's where you can just be totally negative and like no one tries to cheer you up (both chuckling).
THERAPIST: Yeah, I see.
CLIENT: And, and I think it's so conditioned in people to try to point out the positive side of everything, um, so it's one reason why I like my friend Michelle so much, is like she's kind of a negative person (chuckling).
THERAPIST: [Like her] (ph) so much, yeah.
CLIENT: And, even that, I think is problematic for her, in some ways, but.
THERAPIST: Do you feel that here? Like do I [seem to funk and honor on the side] (ph), like a more positive side of things? [00:35:06]
CLIENT: No. I mean (pause) I think (pause) you know you have a more like neutral, analytical sort of approach, in talking more about like (pause), I don't know, more like Sue or like [inaudible at 00:35:23], especially Sue (both chuckling). So like every time I come for [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: More like Sue and Sue really, yeah (ph) (both chuckling).
CLIENT: Yeah, and since she's [like real folks] (ph), yeah Sue [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . and Erica both, like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . I think they both think that what friends are for is sort of like cheering [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: To cheer you up.
CLIENT: . . . each other up and making people feel better, and that's very common.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, Jeff is a little better. He, he still sort of has that model of interaction, but (pause) you know having or dealing with depression [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . just makes him realize how unrealistic (chuckling) it can be to think of the positive of everything. [00:36:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, (huffing chuckle) yeah (ph).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah, Erica (ph) described it, when I spoke with her, is that thinking in the positive (other chuckling) just means like you kind of come towards each other in that way, where you — I remember when you first talked to me of being involved with him, you felt like there was a lot you really wanted to say, mostly negative, dark sorts of stuff that you really felt like you couldn't say to him. And it sounds like you feel a bit less of a need, [so how can you know that weigh] (ph)? And he's, also, somewhat more like open to and able to hear you out on something, it's more like that. [00:36:55]
CLIENT: Yeah, (pause) yeah, I think. I don't know how much of it is just like you can credit to getting used to each other. I think when you first start dating someone, like they really don't know how you react to things, and how resilient you are than to be worried, and so maybe they're more likely to have a pro-active model of trying to make you feel better and like make sure you're okay, and they feel this like burden of responsibility. Um, but I [think now that we had it] (ph), so used to me and is sort of seeing how I operate, and it seems that I can feel pretty negative for days and sort of you know keep on (slight chuckle) going. Um, I mean that has just helped a lot [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . in, in his reactions and, um (pause), you know (pause), yeah, I know he's been sort of flexible in that way, in the way that (pause) like Sue hasn't. [00:38:05]
Um (pause), I feel bad. I feel like Sue has noticed men not confiding in her and telling her things (slight chuckle). Um, 'cause she's been really trying to, (pause) uh, be stable and not say stressful things, like you know she's making an effort now, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . which is good. But, (pause) um, it's sort of a test for me to see how good I can be at communicating what I want in a way that actually works (slight chuckle).
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: It's hard (slight chuckle). [Silence from [00:38:45] to 00:38:52]
THERAPIST: Well now how do mean?
CLIENT: Um (pause), I think sometimes I get stuck in dialogues with her, where (pause) you know I'll say something negative (slight chuckle). [00:39:04]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And she'll, she'll be like "oh, it's like so nice you know having" — I'll say like, "Oh my God, I just paid like 400 dollars for this repair on my car. I can't believe it."
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: She's like, "Oh, you know it must be like so nice have your car." Like it was like "Hanover and Jackson are like a totally different place, like you know that [inaudible at 00:39:23] ability is awesome" (both chuckling). Like "yeah, it would be more awesome if it didn't cost me so much damn money" (both chuckling)!
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, and like it'll, it'll go like "oh, it's you know so great that you're working on this novel, [inaudible at 00:39:35] you're (ph) really good". Um (pause), and I think I just really doubt the idea of these sort of simple truths being imposed upon my life and how I feel (questioningly), [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: . . . so I always feel the need to complicate it (both chuckling). I'm like "well, it's good in some ways, but like bad because every day I like know that I'm spending hours on something that could totally flop and that's (other chuckling) not very comforting" (chuckling). [00:40:00]
So, I don't know, I (pause), I get into these exchanges in which I don't think like either of us really gets what we wanted out of it, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . and it's, it's sort of strange, as to what either of us wants out of it (chuckling), like they seem kind of pointless; like why, why are we saying these things to each other, why do we converse like this? I don't know. Um (pause), and I think (pause) her idea is to start conversations and sort of try to make me feel better about life (huffing chuckle), (pause) but [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: [It seems that] (ph) she's just mostly annoying you, it sounds like.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [And this doesn't bring you up] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, and I stopped really talking about [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Sure.
CLIENT: . . . myself and that's, but I think you know that she notices, she's not totally impervious (chuckling).
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um (pause), and I, I've tried to be a little more sort of direct with her in saying "you know I'm trying not to really imprint value judgments on my life, because (pause) I think just sort of being okay with the fact that it kind of sucks and trying to just take it one day at a time, is much healthier than trying to tell myself it's good, when really it's kind of not" (chuckling). [00:41:16]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um (pause), so I don't know, maybe if I keep saying things like that repeatedly. Because it's, it's not like she's like an unusually bent person, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . I just think it's a certain model of [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . friendships that is so widely accepted, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Correct (ph).
CLIENT: . . . um, that it's hard to break from that.
THERAPIST: Scripted (ph). We have to stop for now. [Oh well I can see] (ph).
CLIENT: Okay, I will be here next week.
THERAPIST: All right, take care.
CLIENT: You too.
THERAPIST: Thanks. [00:41:55]
