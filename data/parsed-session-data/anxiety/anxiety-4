
The 1960s shattered the status quo. From the death of John F. Kennedy,
the first walk on the moon, and the Vietnam War to the black and
women's movements, and the sexual revolution, it was a decade of enormous
upheaval and change. African Americans were finding their collective voice
to say to white America, "We've had enough of being defined by you, of
being told where we can and can't go. We know what's possible, and we see
the power in ourselves to achieve it. The time for change is now."


The success of the Civil Rights Movement in gaining the attention of the
country inspired other groups historically discriminated against to begin to
think and act in more self-determining ways. Stirred by the challenges to
tradition that were going on all around them, young people were becoming
increasingly disaffected by middle-class values. The country was practically
under siege from the various liberation movements that were dismantling
convention and exploring new ways of being in the world.


Bob Dylan sounded the call to arms: "Everybody must get stoned!" The
alteration in consciousness that has had the most profound effect on American
life came with the introduction of mind-altering drugs to the youth of
the country in the 1960s. Mariiuana, long a staple of the jazz world, was just
beginning to find its way onto college campuses and into the streets of large
cities where young people were gathering to play out a crisis of identity that
was to last for an entire decade and more.


Experimentation didn't stop with mariiuana. LSD was extolled as the miracle
fix for the New Age. Hope is just another hit away! The quest for magic
potions that has followed on these early, innocent forays into drug use has
become awesomely destructive. The new business of illicit drugs took shape
and an international killer industry was born. America has never been the
same since.


While La Jolla was not exactly psychedelically inclined, it would have been

"Try it. Try it. C'mon. You'll love it!" The dollar bills were rolled, the
lines laid out, and I was implored to join the party. Okay. I'll try it. I snorted
a line, I felt the rush, and I loved it. I did another line, then stopped, but
everyone else kept going. Months later, at the next meeting, I snorted again
and loved it even more. I decided to buy some to take back to Los Angeles
with me. I was nervous about carrying it on the airplane, so a fellow board
member offered to carry it if I would give her some of it.


At home I anticipated with delight the feeling I knew I would get from
the cocaine hit. I got out the little container of white powder and rolled it
around in my hand, previewing the pleasurable sensations to come. Then,
suddenly, my thoughts shifted to a disturbing idea—I could get into this
habit very easily. I thought about clients whose lives had been blighted by
the escalating use of cocaine. I thought about the brilliant friend I recently
visited on the psychiatric ward at Cedars-Sinai recovering from his cocaine
addiction. I thought about my inclination to become addicted to things that
make me feel good. Decision time. Regretfully, I tossed the lovely white powder
down the toilet, flushed, and never used cocaine again.


While social rules were being redefined in response to the new advocacy
movements, another revolution was about to occur that would seriously influence
the way ordinary people lived. In 1960, the Federal Drug Administration
approved the first oral contraceptive. By the end of that year, "the pill"
was being marketed and the sexual revolution had quietly begun.


One outgrowth of the burgeoning interest in sexual innovation was an
organization called the Sexual Freedom League. I first heard about it from
a psychologist friend who'd been to several of their events in Berkeley, where
its activities were flourishing. Up for adventure and fascinated by my friend's
lurid tales, I asked him to arrange for me to go to an SFL "party." Amused,
he agreed to do so.


Attendance was strictly by referral from someone already in the SFL network.
The only other requirement was that everyone had to arrive with a

[p. <i>124</i>]

On arrival at the apartment where the SFL was meeting, we were each
handed a brown paper bag, instructed to write our name on it, remove all
our clothes, and place them in the bag. I felt hesitant, suddenly shy, wondering
why I was doing this crazy thing. I looked around the living room of
the apartment. About fifty people stood about, talking and drinking, looking
like any congenial group anywhere, except they were all stark naked.


Slowly I removed my clothes, folding them neatly as if doing so brought
some kind of order to what I was about to do. People were drifting into the
bedrooms, and after drinking several glasses of wine, I joined the migration.
There were three bedrooms. I chose the middle one. As I stood in the doorway,
I had to catch my breath I was so shocked at the sight before me.
The room was without furniture, the floor a wall-to-wall carpet of bodies
in motion. Through the semidarkness it was impossible to see who was doing
what to whom, but they all seemed connected in one large undulating mass.
There were sounds of moaning and heavy breathing punctuated by short
spasmodic screams. I felt immobilized, but I told myself I couldn't just stand
in the doorway. I took a deep breath and plunged in, literally.


For the next two hours I melded into the "carpet." One person blurred
into the next. I have no idea what was done to me or what I did to anyone
else because I felt as though I were in a dream. Whatever I experienced, the
feeling was quickly replaced by the distraction of someone new touching
me.


On two occasions I did "wake up" enough to become startlingly aware
of what was happening. The first time, a man next to me reached over and
began to caress the back of another man. Suddenly, all of the action around
me stopped. Three people sat straight up.


"We don't do that here," one said. The man withdrew his hand and the
action resumed.


So this was strictly heterosexual. No, not quite. The second time I woke
up was when someone took my hand and placed it in a hand that was distinctly
female. She held tight. I could not see her face since she was one
body away, but the female hand began to stroke my palm. It was quite pleasurable,
and I was aware of faces around me smiling, too. Sexuality was
apparently okay between two women but absolutely taboo between two men.
As I realized what was happening, I felt a surge of anger. Sexual freedom

[p. <i>125</i>]

I withdrew my hand and struggled to my feet. I'd had enough. Something
was stirring in me, a kind of rage at rejection that I didn't understand. Although
I was still convinced I wasn't homosexual, I was nonetheless very
angry about what had just happened. How dare these people set the rules
for everybody else? That man wasn't hurting anyone. What he did was his
own business and that of the person he touched. They had no right to interfere.
This growing anger in me was the first hint, I see now, of something
that would later take on a life of its own.


I thought I was finished with the Sexual Freedom League, but not quite.
A journalist friend in Los Angeles, Joe, heard I'd gone to an SFL party. He'd
been assigned to cover one and asked me if I would accompany him. I was
curious to see how SFL Berkeley differed from SFL Los Angeles.


Hawaiian Gardens? I didn't even know where that was. The white picket
fence did not bode well. Inside, the house was a miracle of bad taste—velvet
furniture, shag rugs, chintz drapes, and flowered wallpaper. About a dozen
men and women sat in the living room, fully clothed, making small talk.
Apparently nothing had started yet.


Joe and I explored the rest of the house. There was the master bedroom
which matched the decor of the living room. Three unoccupied children's
rooms were complete with teddy bears, tricycles, flaxen-haired dolls, and
framed nursery rhymes on the wall. I shuddered at the thought of having
sex in any of these rooms.


As we were touring, two couples came out of the living room, entered
one of the children's bedrooms, and closed the door. Several other couples
disappeared into another child's room, closing the door behind them. Why
would anybody want to have sex in a child's bedroom? Must be something
I was missing. Maybe these people had children of their own and were turned
on by crossing the line of this taboo in so safe and removed a situation.
Maybe I just wouldn't think about it.


Soon all the bedroom doors were closed. We rejoined the living room
crowd which had grown in our absence. Couples soon emerged from behind
bedroom doors and were replaced by other couples. This was so tame as to
be unnerving. Group sex in Hawaiian Gardens consisted of a sedate procession
of couples disappearing behind closed doors to do something very quietly

[p. <i>126</i>]

I was soon bored with this chaste scene. Joe talked to a few people and
we left, giggling all the way to my house, where we tumbled into bed and
had an SFL party of our own that was neither chaste nor boring.


I first met Marvin Liebman in the early 1950s when Luce brought him into
my bookstore. They had been friends in New York, and now Marvin was
working as a fundraiser for a Jewish organization in Los Angeles. A gay man,
his politics were left of liberal. He was a talker and a charmer and attracted
interesting, accomplished people like a magnet, most of whom he dragged
into my shop. In the postbookstore days, Marvin and I remained friends,
then we lost touch for a while when he returned to New York to take a public
relations job. That job prompted an incredible turnabout in his politics.


In the early 1960s, I was visiting Marvin in New York. By that time he
had his own public relations firm, and I was standing in his waiting room,
stunned at what I was seeing, a poster touting Dr. Fred Schwartz, a major
conservative anticommunist and hatemonger. I had just cut up my Richfield
Oil credit card because that company sponsored Schwartz's television
program.


"Darling, how wonderful to see you!" Marvin rushed out to greet me,
his usual effusive self.


"Marvin, why do you have Fred Schwartz in your waiting room?" I sternly
demanded.


"Oh. Well, he's my client. I promote him."


Further conversation revealed that Marvin had become the darling of the
country's leading right-wingers, many of whom were his clients and friends.
Conservative Charles Edison (son of Thomas Alva and former governor of
New Jersey) was his chief benefactor and mentor. Congressman Walter Judd,
an old China hand and staunch anticommunist was Marvin's main supporter
in his founding of the Committee of One Million to keep Red China
out of the United Nations, an objective that Marvin was later personally
credited with achieving for fifteen years. William F. Buckley was Marvin's
best friend.


"What happened to you, Marvin?"


"Let's go to lunch, darling. I'll explain everything."


He didn't explain anything. He just said it was only business and he didn't

[p. <i>127</i>]

"Don't be ridiculous, darling. We've been friends all these years. We'll
be friends the rest of our lives."


"Then we'll have to talk about this political thing."


"Fine."


I quickly learned that I couldn't begin to prevail in a political discussion
with Marvin. I was a mere amateur. He was a consummate political professional
—he charmed, cajoled, soothed, and lied. I gave up and agreed to a
détente so long as he understood that I didn't approve of what he was doing.


In the summer of 1963 I was invited to present a paper at the Third International
Congress of Group Psychotherapy in Milan, Italy. When I told Marvin,
he was delighted.


"Fabulous, darling. We'll go to Europe together, play for a few weeks,
then you can go off to your conference." That sounded great because I'd
never been to Europe and Marvin had been many times. My fantasy about
him knowing the languages and the ropes collapsed, however, when on our
first night out I asked him what I should order from the French menu. He
hesitated, then suggested, "This <i>pamplemousse demi</i> sounds good." When
the half grapefruit arrived as our dinner I realized that Marvin was no more
practiced in French than I was. I took four years of French in high school
but was always a terrible language student, and anyway I'd slept through
most of Miss Brazelton's classes. It was obvious I would have to summon
up what language I could and speak for myself.


The Hotel Majestic in Cannes is a great white whale of an edifice overlooking
the boulevard de la Croisette and the Bay of Cannes. It is one of
the grande dames of the French Riviera. Marvin and I had a bay-view corner
suite with bedrooms on either side of a huge parlor.


By the summer of 1963, Marvin and I had settled one important aspect
of our relationship. We had tried from time to time to turn our friendship
into a romance, but that didn't work for either one of us. After all we were
two gay people, though we were both acting within the accepted homosexual
ethic of the time—conceal it, deny it, and work around it. Being gay was
certainly not something to incorporate into one's identity, much less to build
a life around. In a sense, Marvin and I were each other's psychological
"beards."


Our first night in Cannes, Marvin had one of his famous attacks of claustrophobia.
It had taken me years to get it through my head that Marvin's

[p. <i>128</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000005176-I0015&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
[p. <i>129</i>]

"Good lord, Marvin, what is wrong?"


"Nothing, darling, nothing."


I knew what was wrong, but I decided to ignore it. I went out on our
balcony. It was early evening, and the summer air was still and hot. The
lights along the Croisette were just flickering on. Bits of French conversation
drifted up from the boulevard below amid the hum of traffic and the honking
of horns. I felt excited to be where I was, but I knew I had to deal with
Marvin sooner or later.


"Okay, Marvin, that's enough. Spit it out!"


Marvin peered at me through the smoke. "Well, here we are. We don't
have any plans yet. We don't know anybody yet. I'm restless, that's all."
Decoded, he was saying, "Here we are alone with no one to distract us from
one another and that is making me nervous."


I reminded him of our New York lunch with his friend Michael Stewart
(of "Bye Bye Birdie" fame). Michael had given us a list of friends he had
in Cannes, with their phone numbers.


"Call the list," I said.


"I've already called, all of them. No one was home."


Sinking into a chair, Marvin looked at me pleadingly.


"Don't you know anyone in Cannes? No, of course you don't. How silly
of me."


The fact was I did know someone. José was a ballet dancer whom I'd met
through Leslie Carron in the bookstore days, and we'd kept in touch. He'd
been with the Paris Ballet but now lived and taught dance in Cannes. I told
Marvin.


"Call him, darling, at once!"


José, delighted to hear from me, came over immediately. He was still the
beautiful person he'd been when I knew him a decade before—dancer's taut
body, cleanly chiseled cheekbones, serious dark eyes, courtly Spanish manner.
The three of us piled into our rented car and headed to dinner.


The Colombe d'Or, in St.-Paul-de-Vence, is a magical place. Its walls are
hung with paintings by Matisse, Picasso, Chagal, and Miro, all of whom had
eaten there in their time. As we walked through the restaurant, an unusual

[p. <i>130</i>]

When we were seated I asked José what that was all about. He said shyly
that he rarely went out in public and people were not used to seeing him.
I learned the next day that José was a legend in Cannes because he was a
brilliant teacher but so reclusive that a José sighting was something to talk
about. I was flattered that this sweet, graceful person came out to do something
just for me that he didn't like doing.


Marvin's restlessness had been easily solved that first evening, but it was
a different story on many of the nights to follow. As is often the case with
some gay men, anonymous sex is the palliative to restlessness. The difference
between closeted gay men and closeted lesbians is that gay men always know
how to find the sex they need, lesbians don't, or at least I didn't in 1963.
Marvin would hit the streets and soon come back with his quarry, hurrying
his prize to his own bedroom.


One evening we'd been out to enjoy France's newest form of entertainment
—a <i>discothèque</i>—where people jammed onto a postage-stamp dance
floor and moved to thunderous recorded music. Bodies banged against one
another under circling colored lights. We'd finally connected with Michael
Stewart's list, and we were having a wonderful time with these New Yorkers
transplanted to the French Riviera. The fun of the evening faded, however,
when Marvin and I returned to our suite and he immediately began changing
his clothes to go out. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I was furious.


"I'm sick of being abandoned every night, Marvin! Why do you get to
go out and have these experiences and I'm stuck here?"


"Well, for heaven's sake, darling, let's go and find you a woman!"


I was horrified. At first I wanted to protest that I didn't sleep with women,
but Marvin knew that wasn't true, for he had been the person who brokered
most of my New York lesbian escapades. "Okay, Marvin, just how do I ‘find
a woman’?"


"They're all over the place, on the backstreets, standing on the sidewalk."


"A prostitute? You want me to pick up a prostitute?"


"Why not? Come on," and he dragged me out the door before I could
think of anything else to say.


As we cruised the dimly lit, narrow streets, Marvin would stop the car
each time we saw a woman leaning against a building or standing at the
curb alone.


"This one?" he'd ask.

[p. <i>131</i>]

"No," I'd say hurriedly, staring straight ahead. After several of these stops
my head began pounding. Was I actually cruising the backstreets of the
French Riviera looking for a woman to have sex with? I could feel the panic
rising in me. How did I get into this crazy situation? Marvin made me do
it. What was I doing with this maniac? He doesn't understand me at all.


"Why are you doing this to me?" I shouted as I began to cry.


"Doing what? I'm only trying to help you."


Marvin stopped the car and I immediately began beating on him with
my fists. "Get me out of here, now!" I screamed.


Marvin tried to start the car. In addition to being one of the worst drivers
on the planet even in the best of times, he was thoroughly unnerved by my
hysterics. He pushed and pulled on the gear shift, metal grinding, the car
jerking, lurching like a bucking bronco. Somehow he finally got it to go in
the direction of the hotel.


The next morning, lying on the gleaming white sand of the plage, I
apologized.


"Never mind, darling," he said. "This gay thing is awful, but I'm afraid
we're stuck with it." But I didn't believe that for one minute. I agreed that
it was awful to be gay, but I certainly wasn't stuck with it.


One day, Marvin went out alone. When he came back, he had a big, blond
boy with him. "This is Leon," Marvin said, pushing the boy toward me.
Leon flashed a toothy smile and held out his hand.


"Hi, Leon," I said. Leon bowed awkwardly and said, "<i>Bon jour</i>."


"He doesn't speak English," Marvin said.


"And just who or what is Leon and how old is he?" I asked.


"He's a fisherman. I met him down by the docks. He's eighteen."


I took a good look at Leon. Though his shoulders were broad and muscular,
his hands were soft and clean. Leon was about as much a fisherman as
I was.


"And what are we going to do with Leon?" I asked.


"He's going to be our guide in Cannes."


"But he doesn't speak English."


"We'll manage," said Marvin.


Leon, understanding we were talking about him, flashed his toothy smile
again. He was quite handsome, in a pretty-boy way. After that, he was with
us constantly. Toward the end of our stay in Cannes, Marvin made the incredible
decision to bring Leon back to New York.


"What for?" I foolishly asked.

[p. <i>132</i>]

"Well, darling, to educate and teach him English, of course," Marvin said,
a ridiculous smile playing across his face. "I think you're mad," I said.
"Doesn't he have a family here?"


"I've already spoken to his father through an interpreter. He's delighted
to have his son sponsored for a trip to the States."


"My god, Marvin, you're serious."


"Of course I am, darling. There's just one problem. Because he's of a
tender age, I have to apply to the mayor of Cannes for a permit to take him
out of France."


"Why is that a problem?"


"Because the mayor is a communist. I have to go to a communist and
ask for a favor."


There was a delicious irony in that. Marvin Liebman, the professional
anticommunist, going hat in hand to seek approval from a communist, but
Marvin did just that. He worked his charm on the mayor and won the okay
to have Leon shipped to New York.


The next day Marvin and I left for Paris. He had made all the arrangements
and given instructions to Leon's family to send him on the airplane
to New York as soon as all his papers were in order. After a few days, Marvin
and I parted ways. He returned to New York while I continued touring Europe
on my own. I had ten days before my conference was to start.


In London, I met with staff members of the Tavistock Institute to exchange
information about our research on groups. In Venice I sat in the
sun on the Piazza San Marco and was pinched on the rear by the gondolier
as I alighted from his boat. In Florence I visited museums and marveled at
the magnificent art and architecture that were everywhere. Finally in Rome,
I was ensconced in the Cavalieri Hilton on a hilltop overlooking the gleaming
rooftops of the city.


I felt adventurous heading out for a visit to the Trevi Fountain. I threw
my coins into the cascading waters, assuring, according to legend, that I
would return to Rome. Suddenly I felt the presence of someone standing
just behind me.


"Is this your first trip to the Trevi?"


A good-looking, beefy young Italian man was smiling at me.


"Yes, I just arrived in Rome today."


"Hello, my name is Mario. I have lived in your country, Brooklyn. I sold
used cars there." Big smile.

[p. <i>133</i>]

We talked and he invited me to dinner. He was polite and friendly, so I
saw no harm in accepting. We walked to a restaurant, where over dinner
he told me about his Sicilian family and his life in Rome—still selling used
cars. He asked me nothing about myself. Coffee arrived and with it Mario's
pitch: "Now we will go to my place and make love."


I looked disbelievingly at him.


"I have bought you dinner. I am very nice to you. Now you must be nice
to me."


"Not that way, Mario. I hardly know you." I looked around for the door.


"Listen, I know about American girls. I know how to be gentle. You won't
be sorry."


I was already sorry. "I think I should go now."


Mario's eyes flashed Sicilian anger. "Bitch!" He reached across the table
and slapped me in the face. I was so shocked I couldn't move. He slapped
again. That did it. I ran for the door, Mario came right behind me, into the
street. I made it to the intersection where a taxi pulled up in response to
my frantic waving. I jumped in and fell back against the seat as the cab
pulled away. I could see Mario on the curb shaking his fist at me, mouthing
curses, his face twisted in anger. I was trembling so I could hardly get the
name of the hotel out as I watched the receding figure of my Sicilian suitor
through the rear window of the cab. How could I have done such a stupid
thing?


Once inside the brightly lit lobby of the Cavalieri Hilton I feel safe in
familiar territory, people all around. I breathe easy and make my way to the
elevators. No, I could use a drink. I head for the bar off the lobby. Perched
on a stool, I think about what just happened to me—comic opera, Italian
style, complete with name-calling, face-slapping, and being chased through
the streets. I am giggling to myself when I realize suddenly that I am being
watched. A man several seats down the bar is staring intently at me. When
I look at him, he smiles. Oh no, not again, I think, and I become very busy
with my drink.


"Excuse me," he begins, moving to the seat next to mine. "I hope you
will not take offense, but I would be very pleased if you would allow me to
buy you a drink."


I pause for a moment before turning to him. What could happen to me
here in my own hotel?


"Please, may I introduce myself?" he says in a cultured English voice.

[p. <i>134</i>]

"Yes, I am staying here."


"Please, if you don't mind my saying so, you looked troubled when you
first came into the bar. Is everything all right?"


I am impressed by the concern in his voice. "Yes, everything is all right,
now," and to my surprise I proceed to tell him all about my adventure with
Mario. He listens very carefully, his face registering sympathy.


"What a terrible experience. I'm so glad you got away from that man.
You're safe now in your own hotel. No harm will come to you here."


Soon, Abdul is telling me his own story. He is a director of the Central
Bank of Iraq, educated in England and in the United States. His parents
died some years before and he had become father to his three younger brothers,
who were out of college and married, freeing him to pursue his own
life. He wants to marry and have a family of his own. He pauses, as though
a little embarrassed at having said so much. "But I am too personal perhaps.
Please, tell me about you."


Abdul looks intently interested as I speak. I like that. I like him, and when
he asks if I'd like to go dancing at Le Pergola, the Hilton's roof-garden club,
I accept. Why not? I'm safe here.


The Cavalieri Hilton perches atop the Monte Mario Hill overlooking
Rome. It is somewhat inconveniently located with respect to the center of
the city, but shuttle buses run every hour to the Via Veneto and the Piazza
di Spagna. The inconvenience is compensated for by the spectacular view
of Rome the hotel offers, and nowhere is that view more stunning than from
Le Pergola.


Abdul and I dance for hours and I hardly notice the effects of the Strega
that has succeeded my gin and tonic in a bow to Italian custom. "It is the
most Italian of drinks, so delicious and mellow. You must try it," Abdul
insists. It is delicious, and I am soon quite mellow. We close Le Pergola and
before I realize what is happening I am in Abdul's room, but I don't care.
I realize how lonely I have been since Marvin's departure. I'm glad to have
Abdul's companionship and he seems glad to have mine, that night and the
next day and night, and the next, three days of sipping Strega and feeling
mellow enough to agree to almost anything Abdul wants to do. We shop
on the Via Veneto, sightsee, and spend long hours in the sun at the Cavalieri
Hilton's beautiful pool.

[p. <i>135</i>]

On the third day of our "romance," Abdul becomes very serious. He says
he has something important to talk to me about. He begins by telling me
that all of his brothers have American wives and that he, too, desires to be
married to an American. He says he thinks we could have a wonderful life
together. He asks me to marry him.


I am so astonished I don't know what to say. I have grown fond of Abdul,
but after two days and three nights he is still a virtual stranger. I've had no
thoughts of an actual relationship with him. This is summer in Rome, a
time out, not real life, but Abdul knows what he wants and he pursues it.


When I find my voice, I say weakly, "Abdul, I can't marry you. I'm Jewish.
Where would we live? I can't live in an Arab country."


"Oh no no, that's not a problem," he hastily reassures me. "We will live
in Beirut. It's a beautiful modern city, very sophisticated and liberal-minded.
It's the Paris of the Middle East. You'll love it there."


I tell Abdul I will think about it. Actually, I'm struck by the irony of the
situation. I do want to get married, but everything about this proposal is
wrong—wrong culture, wrong continent, wrong script all together. I'm
grateful that I'm leaving for Milan the next day. That night I gently tell Abdul
that I cannot accept his offer of marriage. He is very disappointed as he
writes out his address in Iraq and asks me to please contact him if I change
my mind. I say I will and that I've had a wonderful three days with him,
which I would never forget. I was right about that part, but for reasons I
had no hint of at the time.


Arriving in Milan, I was quickly drawn into the Third International Congress
of Group Psychotherapy. Given that it was the 1960s, it didn't seem particularly
bizarre that a Dutch psychologist presented on a therapy group in which
all the members took LSD at each session, including him, for he wanted to
be on the same "psychological plane" as his patients. Another presentation
was on a therapy group designed to "cure" homosexuality. The group was
made up of male homosexuals and beautiful girls. The results were termed
"inconclusive." As for me, I made my presentation, saw old friends, and
made new ones.


The hottest gossip of the Congress revolved around what appeared to be
the galloping senility of the elderly president of the International Council
of Group Psychotherapy, Dr. J. L. Moreno, well-known for his invention of
"psychodrama." In most of his presentations Dr. Moreno made no sense at

J. L.'s wife, Zerka, was everywhere at this conference trying to take over
for her failing husband but audiences were no kinder to this aggressive lady,
distinctive in appearance because she had only one arm. Compassion for the
Morenos gave way to annoyance with them. I was appalled at the behavior of
the grownup professional attendees and I hoped that when my turn came
to lose my mental compass, I would have the sense to stay home. I felt sorry
for Zerka but this was not to be my last encounter with her.


Several years after the Milan meetings, I visited the Moreno Institute in
Manhattan to observe a demonstration of psychodrama techniques. Zerka
was the demonstrator. She asked for volunteers to join her on the stage. No
one came forward. She entreated and cajoled. Nothing. Exasperated, she
came down into the audience, grabbed my arm, and led me up the stairs
onto the stage. I didn't like it, but I went along.


Zerka sat opposite me and began asking questions. I told her who I
was and why I was in New York. She then leaned forward and looked into
my eyes. I felt a chill go down my spine. She was moving in for the kill,
setting me up for a conflict that could be played out in the psychodrama
mode. I felt tense and I reminded myself that I didn't have to tell
her anything. I was shifting uncomfortably in my chair when she asked her
question, slowly and deliberately. "Who did you have breakfast with this
morning?"


I sat very still. How could she know to ask that? Did she just look at me
and see "queer"? Something inside me tipped. I had just come away from
one of my lesbian adventures, and I wanted to shout back at her, "Okay, I
slept with a woman last night. So what? Who cares?" but I actually said,
"It's none of your business!"


Zerka smiled. She had me. After that I could hear Zerka's voice, but my
mind wandered away. Why was I so panicked by this exchange? Zerka didn't
matter. She couldn't hurt me. It was I who made judgments about homosexuality.
I was the one who condemned myself for being attracted to women.
I was the one to watch out for.


Suddenly, I knew I had to get out of there, away from Zerka, that
audience, my own thoughts, but I felt leaden, unable to rise. With all my
