<font size="4"><b>Chapter II: On Buying an Hotel</b></font>

"I SAY, I don't think the Justices will take a woman
as licensee"—Mr. Belgrave shook his head doubtfully—"Not
as a rule, anyway. Can't say I blame 'em
either. Usually trouble when you get a woman holding a
licence."


"Oh, my God!" I said this under my breath so that
Mr. Belgrave could not hear. Negotiations for the purchase
of "The Marlborough Arms" were going forward slowly.
Amongst other things we had come up against was the
problem of who was going to take the licence. A streak
of squeamishness in my nature had manifested itself in
that, while I was fully prepared to own and direct a
licensed hotel, I felt it incompatible with the dignity of
my professional degrees actually to hold the licence. It
had been finally decided that the success of the whole
enterprise depended on Christiane, a reluctant Christiane,
taking this. I had come up to Mr. Belgraye's City office
to discuss this.


"They might take your wife as the director of a
Limited Company, of course. Now, if you formed a
Company"—Mr. Belgrave stroked his chin—"You might
get her through. Though it's not certain. Even then they
may turn her down."


So we had to get busy with turning ourselves into a
Limited Company and this took time and money. We
called our company Posting Houses, Ltd., for we were
young and our ideas were expansive—we already thought

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The problem of the management of the hotel had
quickly presented itself to us in acute form. I put my
foot down over this. Financial necessity made me do so.
Obviously we could not, to start with anyway, afford
the services of a professional manager for "The Marlborough
Arms," which the accounts had shown to be
a small business just capable of making a living for the
proprietor and his wife. Our available capital would not
allow this until such time as the business increased
—I took it for granted the business would increase.
Likewise it would do us good, I thought, to learn the
business the hard way by personal experience.


All the same, we felt the need of someone to share the
responsibility with us, to be a buffer between ourselves
and the more mundane parts of hotel-keeping, such as
entertaining customers, presenting bills and so on. In
our inexperience there seemed only one answer to this
problem, namely a partner—a partner who would be
willing to work in the business and perhaps put a small
amount of money in. And our thoughts automatically
flew to our friend, Max Colyer-Fergusson. Max Colyer-Fergusson
had, like myself, come to a crisis in his life—in
his case in his middle forties. His many years spent as
<i>seigneur</i> of his oddly-named residence, Wombwell Hall,
Gravesend, were drawing to a close: and it was at this
critical juncture in his existence that we had met him at
the house of our friends, the Plumsteads.


"Expenses too much, old girl," said Max. Max, a
widower, invariably addressed himself to Chris. "Got
to cut down. Live in a smaller place, and let the old place

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Max had been brought up and educated as a gentleman
in the palmy Edwardian days—in the days when to be a
gentleman meant to do nothing other than live on
invested money, when to be a gentleman in the full
mystical meaning of the term was the be-all and end-all
of existence. And now that circumstances had changed
and the spectre of work was in the offing he had only one
condition—namely that the work which he undertook
was work that would be fit for a gentleman.


When we approached him with the suggestion of
joining forces his enthusiasm for the project was such
that, as we discussed the matter round our fireside on a
February afternoon, we felt it incumbent on us to give
him due warning of the nature of his prospective job.


"I know, old girl," replied Max, as he polished his
pince-nez vigorously, holding each eye-glass to the light
in turn to see that he had done a thorough job. "Pubkeeping
used to be a pretty scruffy pastime, but Fothergill
has changed that. You've read his book haven't you?
Grand book. What's good enough for a bloke like Fothergill
is good enough for me. After all, he was a gentleman."


We explained the job we had to offer in more detail
and it seemed to suit Max. While on his side he was able
to recommend himself to us by his just claims to an
extensive acquaintance with the interiors of licensed
establishments and his equal willingness to impart his
lore for our benefit. That his experience had been confined
to the customer's side of the bar counter served, in our
opinion, rather to enhance his value than otherwise as my
prospective assistant in the day-to-day affairs of the hotel.


"Don't mind what I do," Max assured us, "Serve in the
bar or anything. After all, I've seen plenty of the other
side of the bar. I should know what's wanted."

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I ventured to bring up the question of his partiality
for the wares which he was to dispense. However, the
stamp of his public school education showed itself in the
manner in which he overcame this difficulty:


"I promise you, old girl," his face took on almost
sacramental solemnity as he looked at Chris steadily
through his now cleaned pince-nez—it was the same
look he must have given his housemaster at Harrow
thirty years previously during his preparation for confirmation.
"I'm knocking it off already. Once I start at
the pub, I won't touch a drop. Not even a snifter, I
assure you."


And indeed, as the weeks went by, our doubts about
him were gradually set at rest by his obvious anxiety to
make good as the assistant manager of a licensed hotel,
by his newly acquired indifference to all forms of alcohol,
and by his continual protestations of a willingness to help
out financially which was only being restrained by the
conservative and unenlightened outlook of his trustees
who had the control of his money.


(2)


At last, the fateful day arrived at the beginning of
April when Chris appeared before the Licensing Committee
of the Justices of the Division of South Wootton
in the Town Hall of Woodstock for the purpose of
becoming the transferee of the licence of "The Marlborough
Arms." A number of questions were asked, in
her answers to which Chris endeavoured to show that
she was an experienced caterer and a fit person in every
way to become a licensed victualler. But, despite Mr.
Belgrave's forebodings, her newly-acquired status as a
company director pulled her through. The formalities
were soon over and we returned to the hotel—our hotel.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Meanwhile at the hotel a jolly morning had been spent
by the agents of both purchaser and vendor. First, in
checking up the extremely sparse inventory of effects
included in the "all at" price. "All at," which is trade
jargon for "inclusive of furniture and fittings," had
sounded good when I had agreed to the purchase price,
but in the case of "The Marlborough Arms" it meant
very little; the furniture and fittings left in the hotel by
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Gowing were few in quantity and,
with the sole exceptions of the canopied four-poster bed
in Number One and of a reasonable equipment of cutlery
for party catering, of negligible value. Then, after that,
they had got down to the real business of valuing the
stock which had to be paid for in hard cash extra to the
price of the establishment. Harry Gowing's "fine wines"
were an extraordinary collection of liquor. They varied
from Napoleon Brandy (two bottles only) to 10 gallons of
whisky in keg. From a very good Charmes Chambertin
and an equally good Beaune 1923 to a single murky
bottle of Barsac. There was a gross of Graves with the
name of an obscure shipper inscribed in handsome gilt
lettering, and the same quantity of an unknown Chateau
White Wine—evidently the heritage from a visit by an
unusually enterprising traveller. There were all kinds and
conditions of Port (some of it good—even if not so good
as Harry Gowing thought it was). Also of Sherry, varying
from Tio Pepe to a muddy Nut Brown. Whilst amongst
other oddities were a few half-bottles of Zeltinger, a
single bottle of Sparkling Burgundy, and even one of
Hall's Wine. In addition to this alcoholic miscellany,
there was a large stock of entirely unwanted cigars which
I found that I had to buy.


"I say. I can't take all this stuff," I protested to Mr.
Belgrave. The cigars were the last straw. They had come
to two hundred pounds, which was no small item for me
on top of the other money I had to pay.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But it was a futile protest. Mr. Belgrave had come down
from London with two of his satellites in order to put
through the transfer of "The Marlborough Arms," and
he meant to let nothing spoil his day.


"H'm. More expensive than ginger-beer and cocoa,
you know," he admonished me flippantly. "You Liberals!
Always expecting ninepence for fourpence! Still thinking
of the good old Lloyd George days, I expect."


Once again Mr. Belgrave became doubled up with
merriment at one of his own jokes.


Eventually however the valuing, the ordeal at the
Woodstock Town Hall, the formal transfer of the licence,
were over. The documents were signed and delivered.
Even the matter of the cigars was settled by a trivial
discount from the total price. And the few lunch-time
customers who appeared while these ceremonies were
proceeding, were served as a matter of formality—for no
licensed establishment must cease its continuity of service
whatever the event. Then we repaired to "The Bear" for
lunch.


There was a party of perhaps a dozen round the
luncheon table at "The Bear." There were Chris, myself
and Max, Colyer-Fergusson, who was wearing his Old
Harrovian tie in deference to the occasion. There were
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Gowing; Mr. Belgrave and his
satellites, with his opposite number, who had been
acting as agent for Harry Gowing, and his satellites;
and, to make up the party, were one or two of Gowing's
"regulars"—ponderous, middle-aged characters, who had
become tacked on during the course of the midday session
at "The Marlborough Arms," and who, not wishing to
be out of anything, had drifted along. It was a good lunch,
accompanied by all the liquor that such an occasion
demands. Then, towards the end of lunch, as was only
right and proper, the ceremonies of toasting commenced.
First, Harry Gowing, who had not consented without

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This led Mr. Powell, who was sitting next to me, to
take up an aside conversation as soon as he sat down after
finishing his speech.


"You don't say you take part in politics, Mr. Johnson?"
he queried in a horror-struck voice.


"Well—er, yes."


"Take my advice, Mr. Johnson," snapped back Mr.
Powell, "I don't want to be a wet blanket on an occasion
like this. But leave 'em alone."


"Well, of course, I wouldn't do much locally."


"Never mind," said Powell. "Leave 'em alone. You
don't have any politics in this business. You'll soon find
that out."


And Mr. Powell, having destroyed the whole scheme
of my existence in those few well-chosen words, resumed
his part in the general conversation.


By the time the cigars and the port circulated it was
three-thirty in the afternoon and it was not until four
o'clock that our party dispersed.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, cheerio, doctor," said the blithe and happy
Mr. Belgrave, who had accompanied Chris, Max Colyer-Fergusson
and myself back to "The Marlborough
Arms." "Afraid we'll have to be tootling off to get back
to Town before dark. You've got a bargain here, if you
manage it right. Managed badly most places are; that's
the trouble with them. Just one formality left, if you
happen to have your cheque book about."


Mr. Belgrave produced a slip of paper from his pocket.
I fortunately had my cheque book about.


"Thanks," acknowledged Mr. Belgrave. "Let me know
any time I can help. Here's hoping the teetotallers of
Bury flock to support you at the poll."


Then carefully folding my cheque for £100 odd in
commission, etc., that covered his trouble in connection
with the matter, he tootled off.


The happy lunchtime atmosphere at "The Bear" had
for the time being kept away dull care concerning the
responsibilities on which we had embarked. But as we
sat down, with Max Colyer-Fergusson, in the dismal
dining room and the effects of lunch wore off, we did
not feel so good. The Gowings had stripped the hotel of
everything but the very sparse inventory of "all at"
effects and they had likewise practically closed down the
business during the last few days of their tenure. "The
Marlborough Arms" was bare, cold, lonely and very,
very dirty.


For the first time the sinister thought struck me that
perhaps Chris had been right in her remarks—that I was
indeed crazy to have paid good money to come into this
God-forsaken hole. Even the usually irrepressible Max
Colyer-Fergusson was slightly subdued.


But Max was never defeated for long.


"Come on, chaps," exhorted Max. "This won't do.
Let's go up in smoke and open the bottle of Sparkling
Burgundy."

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Max disappeared down the cellar and returned with the
bottle.


"Positively my last drink," said Max, as he drew the
cork and poured out the foaming purple liquid into
champagne glasses.


With the feeling that we were delving the depths of
depravity we finished off the bottle between the three of
us. Then we felt better.


"Now for the brewers' plates!" exclaimed Max.


The next hour was spent, amidst periodic whoops and
war-cries from Max, in unscrewing and removing the
black and gold BASS and GUINNESS signs on either side of
the entrance to the hotel—the same ones to which I had
objected on my first visit. And after that in fixing in
somewhat inexpert fashion over the door lintel the newly-prepared
board with the inscription "Christiane Marthe
Johnson, licensed to sell wines, spirits, beer and tobacco"
tastefully done in Old English lettering. This cheered us
up immensely. We were getting dug in.


The new era in the history of "The Marlborough
Arms" had started.


(3)


What, however, of our new and hitherto unfamiliar
surroundings in which we found ourselves as we opened
up at six o'clock in our fresh capacity of licensed victuallers
of wines, spirits, beer and tobacco? For those of my
readers so unfortunate as not to know these, some
description is necessary.


The heart of England geographically, Oxfordshire is—
it can well be maintained—the heart of England in other
ways also. An unspoilt countryside, inhabited by warm-hearted
people in whom is mingled the friendliness of the

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the heart of Oxfordshire itself, at the foot of the
gradual slope up to the Cotswolds, eight miles north of
Oxford, lies Woodstock, a small town of triangular shape
with an extension along the main road in the shape of
Old Woodstock, which is divided from the main town by
the valley cut by the small River Glyme. A township of
repute in Early English, nay Anglo-Saxon, times—the
country residence of the early English Kings, in fact—
Woodstock, despite its population of barely 1,800
inhabitants, is a township of repute today. An ancient
Borough, dating its incorporation from 1453, the drab
standardization of modern life has not yet completely
absorbed Woodstock into its ambit. It still exercises its
corporate rights with independence, even if it has not
always done so with discretion.


In taking over "The Marlborough Arms" we had
become heirs to an age-old tradition. Throughout the
centuries, since the days when Henry II built New
Woodstock as an appendage to the Royal Palace in order
to house his retinue (Old Woodstock had already been
in existence several hundred years), the tradition of
hospitality to the stranger has survived as the mainstay
of the Town's fortunes and will be the occasion for what I
hope will prove in these pages to be a worthwhile contribution
to the chronicles of a historic place. The proud
boast of Woodstock is of no less than ten licensed establishments,
six of them of substantial size, in a town of
1,800 people.
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19540');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19540" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">∗Lest narrow-minded folk from the outside world consider this number
excessive let it be stated that in the year 1950 in which this was written the
Justices in their wisdom saw fit to grant yet another licence.</div>


Even the hardiest of traditions has, however, had its ups
and downs, brought about by change of circumstances,
and the history of Woodstock during the previous eight
hundred years prior to our arrival showed evidence of

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But the passing of the stage coach saw the decline of
this grandeur. Woodstock, so it seems, entered a long
deep sleep which even the construction of the branch
line to Blenheim (for Woodstock) Station (no Sunday
trains) failed to interrupt to any noticeable extent. First
it became a stagnating market town: then eventually in
the nadir of the nineteen hundreds even the market was
lost to Oxford.


The first thirty years of the motoring era would seem
to have failed to revive Woodstock to any appreciable
extent. Twentieth century traffic, oblivious to historical
dignity, roared through on arterial road A34, but only the
charabanc parties, lured by nothing better than the
convenient parking places in the wide half-deserted streets,
stopped. In late 1936 Woodstock still showed unmistakable
symptoms of decay—the soft Oxfordshire sandstone
of the Georgian frontages was crumbling, the small

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The Marlborough Arms" had undergone the same
vicissitudes as had the town as a whole. The busy,
prosperous fashionable Posting House had sunk to the
status of a small town public house. Only the shell of the
building remained, unaltered since its halcyon days of
one hundred and fifty years ago, an anachronism in
stone and wood. "The Marlborough Arms" was a Rip
Van Winkle of pubs that had gone to sleep and now found
itself in the year 1936 in the same structural arrangement,
except for minor details, as it had been after its reconstruction
in 1763.


(4)


We did not remain lonely for long following the
afternoon of our take-over at "The Marlborough Arms."
We soon found that, in addition to this derelict building,
we had bought Harry Gowing's valuable goodwill. This
consisted of charabanc parties, bookmakers, rosy-cheeked
and somewhat tough citizens of Birmingham and, most
constant of all, the "local" trade who gathered in the
snug each evening for their nightly game of <i>Misère</i>.
These came in and out throughout the day with a variety
of different demands and requests.


"Just one before opening time, boss?" pleaded the
charabanc parties who arrived, nominally, for cups of tea

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Where's old 'Arry gone?" asked the rosy-cheeked
and somewhat tough citizens, who called at any time
between two and five in the afternoon, clamouring for
home-cured ham or one of Mother Gowing's specially
grilled steaks.


"A nice pot o' tea with a double one all round in the
pot," demanded the bookmakers, who looked in about
five on their way home from the Races.


"Nobody's going to interfere with us," said the locals,
proud and privileged, as befitted the direct drinking
descendants of the courtiers of Henry II, and bitterly
jealous of privileges won by years of regular patronage in
the "snug."


This miscellaneous custom had been catered for by
Mr. and Mrs. Gowing themselves with the sole aid of
buxom sixteen year old Nancy, combined chambermaid,
waitress, kitchen portress and (on special occasions)
lavatory attendant. In our own efforts to reach the stars
and transform "The Marlborough Arms" into the type of
hotel which we desired it to be, it was crystal clear that
we would need a larger staff than this. The subject of
staff had been a bone of contention between Chris and
myself ever since the start of our project:


"If you want to run the place properly, you want a
proper staff," Chris had declared. "You can't run a
decent kitchen without a proper chef and a kitchen
porter."

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I demurred. A chef, even in those days, was £6 to £8
per week: a kitchen porter would be another two or three.
The expenses that we contemplated were already terrifying.
Even with the amount of money which I had garnered
from the bank on loan, my resources were starting to run
low after I had paid for Harry Gowing's stock. Obviously
caution must be the key-note.


"Caution, my foot!" said Chris. "You'll ruin yourself
with your own stinginess. We ought to have an expert
manager instead of running it ourselves when we don't
know a thing about it."


However, I was adamant. We couldn't afford a chef.
We certainly couldn't afford a manager—other than
Max Colyer-Fergusson, anyway. We must go cautiously
to start with, employing the barest minimum. The barest
minimum eventually proved to be Mrs. Walters, our
lady cook at £2 IOS. od. a week; Mr. Lovell, our Admirable
Crichton of a barman at £2 a week; our Purley housemaid,
pretty red-headed Irish Mary who came with us as
waitress; and the indispensable Nancy who agreed to
stay on with us. These, with Chris, "Granny," Max
Colyer-Fergusson and myself were the working corps at
our disposal to construct the first-class business which was
our ultimate aim. For the moment, however, we had to
make do with the tricky type of business which we
had inherited and our stand-by in this respect was
unquestionably Nancy, ever-helpful and ever-present
except for mysterious disappearances when the charabancs
arrived in the early morning full of ladies. Anxious
when we missed her, to start with, we soon learnt
that her defection was but a prelude to her reappearance
on their departure, clutching a handful of sweaty
pennies, the outcome of her collection from standing by
the door of the upstairs lavatory in the manner taught
her by Mrs. Gowing and taking toll as each lady
entered.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our management problem was settled too in similar
fashion. We would manage the place ourselves—assisted
by Max Colyer-Fergusson. We would learn by our own
mistakes. In order to maintain the proper attitude of
aloofness which I thought to be consistent with my
professional status, we had decided that we would live
away from, the hotel. I had accordingly bought the
pleasant stone-built house by the side of the wood in
Grove Road, Bladon, which I still possess: and we moved
in there ourselves, while Max Colyer-Fergusson became
resident manager at the hotel.


This seemed an ideal arrangement. There was a good
deal to be said for keeping a pub when one could get up
at 9.30 a.m. and stroll the odd three-quarters of a mile
at one's own leisurely pace up the leafy road to Woodstock
to take up the reins of office an hour later. Every morning
during these first spring days of our life in Woodstock,
both Chris and I found fresh thrills of pleasure at the
contrast to the town-dwelling to which we had both been
accustomed. Susceptible as I am to historic atmosphere,
I could not help ruminating on the difference in my
present surroundings from those of my early life in
Bury where every landmark of former times had been
obliterated by industrialism. As one took the short cut
through the field on the outskirts of the Park, one could
look over the stone wall and see the old oaks, now stricken
and hollowed with age, which are reputed to have been
in existence when the Plantagenet Kings hunted deer in
the Royal Park. Then, as one entered the town of Woodstock,
a short way to the left lay the row of houses in
which is "Cromwell's House," where the Lord Protector
is reputed to have stayed in the days when this, too, was
an inn, during his siege of the Royalist stronghold of
Oxford.


A brief walk past here led to the gates of Blenheim
Park and no description such as this can be complete

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121812-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The business of running the hotel, as I thought,
settled, I was able to expend my enthusiasm in these
early days of my proprietorship in delving into the
history of "The Marlborough Arms" itself. My researches
were helped by the fact that the freehold of the property
had until recently been in the possession of Balliol
College and, with the permission of the authorities of
that College, I was able to search their records to discover
a succession of documents showing the passing of
the property from one lessee to the next in uninterrupted
series back to 1638—the first of these documents I had
photographed and this photograph appears in this book
in the form in which it hangs today framed in the lounge
of the hotel. It was of some interest to find that the hotel
had then been known as "The George Inne" (the present
name being, of course, only acquired when the Marlborough
family came to Woodstock) and I traced "The
George Inne" back a further two hundred years to when
it appeared in the first rent roll of the newly enchartered
Borough of Woodstock in 1466.

How many English hotels trace themselves back in
direct descent to 1466, or beyond that? Not, I think,
many.


My energies could not, however, be confined to
historical research. Historically fascinating though it
might be, nothing could be done with "The Marlborough
Arms" in its present state. It had to be redecorated and
refurnished from top to bottom; and, in addition to this,
extensive structural alterations would be needed to make
it capable of coping with a first class hotel and restaurant

research, I on my side pottered about, finding blessed
mental relaxation, as compared with the heavy responsibilities
of a doctor's life, in immersing myself in the
trivial details of hotel service.


It was a happy, dream-like existence, informed above
all by the zest of new adventure. It still seemed a little
