THE LIGHT IN TOWN was dingy, late October, and the
old brick buildings seemed to hunker down beneath
their ornate facades. Across the street, the bank's time
and temperature sign counted the minutes toward the hour. I
turned, stared through a steamy bakery window, and thought
briefly of going in. There was almost time. I stared a moment
longer, then walked slowly down the little side street, breathing
hard and dragging out the minutes.


I was thirty, at the very start of therapy, and so far, for each
of the last six weeks, I had come to my appointment, the last one
in my psychologist's workday, and had sat in my chair, miserable,
confused, and inarticulate. I had taken eight hours' worth of tests,
and although we had cursorily discussed the results, each week he
told me it was up to me to identify my issues and my goals. But
I could not. I had ransacked my journals, made lists, and plain
old sat staring out my study window late at night. With all I'd
been through recently, it should have been quite easy. But I just
didn't <i>know</i>, I thought, even though last week he'd told me that
today would be the final deadline. If I didn't think of <i>some</i>thing,
the implication seemed to be, this would be my last session.


Ever since junior high, I had been painfully conscious of the
suspicion that something was profoundly wrong with me. I had
no idea <i>what</i> was wrong, or even why I believed there was a problem.
Mostly I just never seemed to be who I really was--although
I had no idea who that was. It seemed to me that I was no one;

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I grew older, I carefully studied the behavior of those
around me, and did my best, on one hand, to force myself to be
bright, cheerful, and outgoing, and on the other, to eradicate every
suspect feeling, thought, and foible I detected in myself. It wasn't
easy, because I couldn't think with any clarity in the presence of
other people. And, when I was alone, it didn't matter quite so
much.


When alone, I often steadied myself by spending long hours
staring into my mirror. I was far from vain, actually believing
myself to be quite ugly, but when I stared into my mirror, I
somehow slipped out of myself. The faces that looked back at me
were not really mine. They all seemed related to me but they were
sometimes very young, sometimes very old, beautiful, wise, boyish,
feminine, mischievous.... These faces were all very real to
me, separate folks, it seemed to me, friends of a sort, and in the
quiet of my bedroom I listened to them speak. My favorite, and
the one I often sought, was beautiful, powerful, and wise. Was I
crazy to believe she was there? Maybe. I was a little old for imaginary
friends, but I could not live without her or the others, and
I felt calmer, stronger, and safer after our visits in the glass.


Secretly, through my high school years, and later on in college,
I promised myself that, once I had finally left home and had put
some distance between my family and me, I would see a counselor.
But, during my twenties, although I often thought about finding
a psychologist, I never did. Each time I imagined a first meeting
with a professional, and imagined being asked what I was doing
there, all I could think of to say was, "I don't know what--but
there's something wrong with me." The prospect was so ridiculous
I never went.


But during the past four or five months, I had begun sliding

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At midsummer, I dragged myself to a language conference.
The paper I presented was highly praised and I tried to coax myself
back to sanity on the regard that I enjoyed. But the truth was
that I had made the alarming discovery that alcohol, a lot of
alcohol, drunk alone in the privacy of my room, seemed to bring
me a kind of peace and quiet I had not known for months. Then
one afternoon, there were suddenly two of me: one Jane lay on the
bed and watched the other Jane sitting at the desk and reading.
One of us had the foresight to pause and write a note. It said:
"Something is terribly wrong. See your doctor when you get
home."


But all that was several months ago, and now that the fall
semester had begun I seemed to be up and functioning. I was
admittedly frightened, as if I had had some kind of close call,
although I was not sure with what.

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That afternoon, at the foot of the little side street, I stepped
into the psychologist's outer office and checked in with his secretary.
Then, as I was sitting in a corner chair and staring blankly
into the pages of a magazine, it came to me that I could answer
the looming question about my goals in one of two ways: I could
ask, in a calm and intelligent way, for a more detailed discussion
of my tests. Or I could simply break down and ask that old anguished
question I had so often asked of the faces in my mirror:
"What's <i>wrong</i> with me? Why is life so <i>hard?</i>"


Soon I was ushered into the inner office. I refused a cup of tea and
sat in my usual chair, facing straight at the door and the little
clock and flower print that hung next to it. He sat as he often
did with his feet up on the edge of his desk and a pipe in one
hand. The October light was fading quickly from the caverns between
the dark brick buildings. A small light burned on his desk;
another illuminated a far corner. I gradually sank into my chair.


The appointment began rather casually. We chatted about the
weather and about school; about how my week had been and about
how my husband was managing his new job. There was no mention
of the dreaded goals or the deadline to come up with some.


And then, without my asking, he brought up the tests. There
had been some indication on them, he told me, that I had perhaps
been traumatized. I stiffened in my chair. He defined trauma in
a general way as a time I may have been so threatened I feared
for my life.


Good Lord, I thought, everybody's been through that. No big
deal. Or had they? I put my feet up on the hassock in front of
my chair. I had often been terrified as a child, and even later in
my life. If everyone else had not been terrified as often as I, it was
because everyone else was braver, smarter, or stronger and was
therefore better able to control what went on around them. The
problem with me was that I was just too sensitive and too stupid
to get along.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He pulled his feet from his desk, reached for new tobacco and
a match, and said, "I'd like to try a brief experiment. You might
close your eyes if you feel comfortable."


I widened them and stared out the window.


He went on. "Imagine that off in the distance is a blackboard
and that on it an age is written. Take your time," he said gently.
"It will come into focus."


I recoiled in my chair, pulled my knees together, and folded
my arms across my chest. "Nine," announced a voice, presumably
my own.


"All right," he said. "Nine. Just sit and think for a little about
being nine years old."


I didn't think. I didn't have the chance. Suddenly, weirdly, I
<i>was</i> nine years old again. My heart was racing, my skin was
clammy, my breathing was fast and shallow, and I wanted to
throw up.


"Well," he said, in the quiet understatement that in later years
I would come to joke about, "you're obviously experiencing something.
Can you tell me about it?"


I twisted in my chair, jerked my legs off to the side, and
clamped one knee over the other.


"We have to talk about my brother then," I said after a while.


"Tell me about him."


I fell silent. I could remember but I could not talk.


Hank, four years older than I and the second oldest of us four
children, had been extremely violent. He wept. He raged. He
smashed windows, lights, things others cared about, things he
cared about, too. At times he threatened to kill himself; at other
times he vowed to kill my mother, my father, my brothers, or me.


"Tell me one thing about him," said my therapist. "Anything
at all."


"He sh... sh... shot... Kip," I finally stammered. My
teeth had begun to chatter.


"And Kip was how old?" my therapist asked.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I stared at him, then saw myself hold up two fingers.


He frowned. "Two?" he said.


I shook my head.


I could see him struggling to decipher my meaning. "Two
years older than you?"


I nodded, trembling, then managed to add: "And two...
two... two years younger than Hank."


"That's right," said my therapist. "And Josh was a year or so
older than Hank." He wheeled his chair a half-inch closer. "So
how did Hank shoot Kip?"


"In the... the... the..." I couldn't say it. My hand went
up to my mouth.


My therapist was watching fiercely. "He shot him in the
mouth?"


I was gulping frantically for air. I shook my head. "Pellet
gun," I managed to say. "Shot... shot off his fingertip."


My therapist winced. "Then what happened?"


I squinched my eyes shut. "We... we... we lied. Kip said
it was a... an... accident. Told Mom he did it himself. But
... but... but..."


"But you knew, didn't you? You knew Hank shot Kip? Did
he shoot him on purpose?"


My eyes were wide with terror. My head went wildly up and
down.


My therapist sat watching me for a while, a quiet, almost
protective presence.


"Was there more?"


My limbs turned rigid with fear.


"Did he do more than that one bad thing?"


Hank had also forced Kip to hold an apple on the palm of his
hand and had thrown a knife at it; Kip's arm took a direct hit.
Another time he frayed the brake cables on Kip's new ten-speed;
Kip cut his hands so badly in the fall he had required stitches.
Once he had even managed to trick Josh, tying him to a tree out

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I looked at my therapist, unable to speak, unable even to nod.


"All right," he said, "I can see there was more."


I forced myself to nod. Then a small voice added, "A lot."


"A lot more?"


I nodded again.


"So," my therapist murmured, "what did he do to you?"


I froze. My brain produced nothing but a kind of static, as if
I had some kind of built-in scrambling device.


"Tell me the worst thing," he said gently.


I sat for a very long time. In my mind, the appointment was
beginning to resemble a Cubist painting come to life. The facets,
the voices, the details all seemed to have to do with the same thing,
but I could not get them to fit together in any kind of usual way. I
slumped, barely breathing in my chair. I stared at my old gray Saucony
running shoes. I thought about buying new ones. I found that
if I pushed my feet down hard on the edge of the hassock that I
could tip it toward me and make the wheels rattle. My left hand discovered,
on a nearby stand, a heavy glass ashtray, and I watched my
hand twirl the thing as if at some great distance. I wondered if it
were even really my hand, this odd, flesh-colored mechanism so intent
on its endeavor. The rest of my body seemed so large and dead
and unfamiliar that I was pretty certain I would never be able to get
it on its feet and walk it out the door.


Occasionally I glanced up at my therapist. He was sitting
forward in his chair. His hands were folded and he had no pipe.
He looked infinitely quiet and infinitely patient. Suddenly I hated
him. I had no idea why. Time passed, and I realized that he had
somehow moved his chair so close to mine that our knees were
almost touching, and all at once I was deeply grateful for the sense
of shelter and protection.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Inside me weird and terrible things were happening. I felt as if
I were swelling up, then as if I couldn't breathe. My mind either
chattered wildly or seized up into a kind of paralytic silence. My
head ached. Pain flashed in my chest. My face and neck went numb.
I felt an old childhood fear that my heart would just forget how to
beat, or my lungs forget how to breathe, and that I would die. Then
a rebellious rage surged through me and I offered up a private challenge
to my therapist: I could outwait him, make him lose his patience,
force him to give up on me. In a way, I wanted him to give
up on me, because I wanted to give up, too, and I began to wish my
heart <i>would</i> stop so I could just die and get it over with.


At five o'clock, the phone rang on his desk. It was his secretary
saying whatever she said when his appointments were up. "We'll
be a few more minutes," he told her.


I looked at the clock and raised my eyebrows.


"I should have asked you this earlier," he said. "Is there anywhere
you have to be tonight?"


I laughed sharply. All those nights came back to me when I
had had to sit alone at the dinner table staring all the way until
bedtime at the plate of congealing vegetables that I refused to eat
for supper.


"You mean you're prepared to sit here all night?" I said. "Until
I cough this up?"


He smiled and shrugged. "It's more that you might find it
difficult to be around people this evening."


"I have nowhere to go," I said. My hand went back to spinning
the glass ashtray.


At one point he reached over and took it from its stand and
emptied it. I had quit smoking long ago but the leftover butts in
the ashtray were interesting. Had I really been a smoker? Had
that been me? He put the ashtray back.


"Are you trying to tell me to stop this?"


"It doesn't matter," he said.


"Good," I said and my hand spun the ashtray the other way.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then the memory of this session shifts. I remember the low,
tempting murmur of his voice. I remember that I both fought it
and responded to it. I remember that I wanted to talk and did
not want to talk. I remember that I had to talk but could not
seem to do it. I seemed to have something to say but I didn't
know what and the minute I tried to put it into words it all
seemed to disappear.


In time, I heard a voice begin to speak. It could only say a
word, a phrase, a half-sentence at a time. Inside I heard other
voices. One twittered with horror. Another muttered that it was
all an utter lie. I was furious that some secret was being divulged
--and strangely terrified and indifferent, too.


The flat, quiet voice went on. It halted frequently. It had to
stop and search for words. It had to wait for a clear channel among
all the interference. It was a voice that wasn't mine, that seemed
to put my chest to sleep, but it was also a voice that seemed to
me to have been there maybe since forever and that, to my horror,
had finally found someone to listen to it.


The voice said that it was summertime.


"Can you tell me your age?" the murmur prompted.


"Nine," the little voice said shyly.


"Can you tell me what you're wearing?"


"Jeans," said the little voice. "And my blue checked shirt.
Also my blue barrette." The voice paused. "You know. My best
one. And a ponytail."


The voice also said that she was barefoot, and that she was
going into the laundry room to take some clothing from the dryer.


"Is anyone there with you?" the murmur wanted to know.


"My mom is at the grocery store," said the voice.


Then I am there, too, walking into the laundry room. My
brother Hank comes in behind me. In his hand is a battered copy
of <i>Gray's Anatomy</i>. I have recently reached puberty. My breasts are
developing. My parents have supposedly talked to my brothers

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He offers me fifty dollars to do what he has planned.


The money scares me. In our family it is traditional for grandparents,
aunts, and uncles to give us money for holidays and birthdays.
I am saving all my money to buy a horse, but Hank is saving
all of his to buy a motorcycle. He even hoards stray coins he finds,
so his willingness to part with such a sum spells danger.


I stand quietly, my hands clinging to one another at my waist.
My bare foot plays across the cool linoleum like the foot of a
runner seeking its mark before a race.


Fifty dollars, he says again.


I say no.


He offers me more.


I say no again.


He lets the heavy book fall to arm's length. "<i>Ja-a-a-ane</i>," he
whines. "It's not fair. You have to let me."


I say no again.


The encyclopedia hits the floor. He lunges.


And the rest is only a series of stills in my memory, like the
remnants of some old, badly damaged film.


My foot slips. My arm is wrenched. My head hits the corner
of the clothes dryer. Hank reaches up under my shirt and wrenches
my bra out of place. He yanks at my jeans and gropes between
my legs. He reaches to open his own pants. Then a car sweeps up
the driveway. Its tires make a familiar whooshing sound. It is our
mother, coming home.


That was all I remembered. And I couldn't tell if I had remembered
it or had made it up. It seemed dangerously real and dangerously
false all at once.


My psychologist remained sitting quietly forward in his chair.
He asked how I had felt during the assault.

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Petrified," I said.


"I know this may sound a little odd," he said, cocking his
head. "But can you tell me where you were during the attack?
What I mean is--"


I cut him off. If he was willing to ask such an illogical question,
I was willing to answer without explanation.


"In the middle of the room," I said. "I watched the whole
thing from the middle of the room."


"You dissociated, then," he said. And he went on to explain
that dissociation is an ancient function of self-defense, still found
in the so-called lizard brain. That after an attempt at flight or
fight, if there is no escape and no chance to win, the conscious
mind simply abandons the body. It might "watch" from some
other vantage point, but later whatever happens will be sealed off
somewhere out of reach of ordinary memory.


"You saved yourself," he said.


I harrumpfed. It seemed to me I had done nothing except
make up some dangerous, lying tale.


He told me that he thought I had paid a big price, that he
was surprised at how normal my tests had been considering what
had happened to me and at what age. He congratulated me on
how well I had done with my life and against what odds. He told
me that what I had just done had taken guts.


I shrugged grumpily and twisted my fingers in my bangs and
stared out the window. The city was dark by now.


He told me that I might be reeling all week and that I should
call him if things got too bad or too confusing.


I nodded, but knew perfectly well I wouldn't.


Still, I felt relieved because it seemed to me that perhaps I
had found someone patient enough and tough enough to really
help. I was still worried, though, about the six-session limit, and
I worked up my nerve and asked if I could come back next week.


He said he thought that would be a good idea.


I remember getting up and walking with great effort toward

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And so we began to work, and what we talked about followed an
agenda no doubt familiar to many who were abused as children.
It was a terrific struggle for me to even begin to express what I
thought and what I felt. It was a struggle, too, to trust my therapist.
I made painfully slow progress in this department, and even
the smallest of untoward events--an incorrect bill, an appointment
canceled or started late--would set me back for months.
Still, we gradually began to discuss my family and my upbringing:
my parents who had longed for the magic daughter to bring joy
and balm into their lives; the dynamics of their marriage; Hank's
behavior; the role each of us children had played in the family
drama; and what had become of us as adults. We talked about
my friends, many of whom were really more like dependents, or,
on rare occasions, about my husband. In time, and without much
discussion, I filed for divorce. With effort, I came to see myself
in new ways, and my role at the college changed. It took a while
to get used to the very startling idea that I was bright, not the
dumb kid I'd grown up believing myself to be, and I worked hard
to rewrite the other destructive scripting I'd received in childhood.
We also talked about depression, nightmares, anxiety, my perpetual
exhaustion, and my health.


We never again went trolling in my subconscious for hidden
traumas. Instead, it seemed that whenever I'd begun to make a
certain amount of headway on some problem centered in the here
and now, I'd run smack into another submerged memory. Then
the details would come surging back, flooding me with flashbacks,
body memory, nightmares, and attacks of anxiety and panic. Because
of the sheer number of old traumas, and the radical changes
I was experiencing, we were soon meeting two hours every week.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And yet, as much as all our work was clearly helping me
become a more capable and confident adult, I still had that old,
sick feeling that something was terribly wrong with me and that
we had yet to get to it. I never mentioned this secret fear because
our office time was crammed with profitable work that was making
substantial improvements in my life and health. In retrospect,
I can see there were several indicators that, had we read them
differently at the time, would have told us sooner exactly where
we were <i>really</i> headed.


One indicator was the fact that every once in a while my psychologist
would discuss the end of therapy--and I would panic.
I feared becoming dependent on him, I feared becoming one of
those people whose therapist is the very pulse of life--but I feared
abandonment, too. Often he would say that, if we were still meeting
two hours a week in six months' time, it would tell us there
was some problem with our process.


Another indicator was that I couldn't seem to stop coughing
up traumas. Sexual abuse, it turned out, had been just the starting
point. But each time some new memory came up, always in response
to a more current issue under discussion, the same thing
happened: I doubted the memory and myself. I was far more
willing to believe that I was crazy, that I was a pathological liar,
that I had a sick and twisted imagination than I was willing to
believe that my own brother had tried to rape me on a summer
morning in the laundry room. I was even willing to believe that
I was making all this up in order to be kept on as a client. Were
I entering therapy now, when some writers have begun to challenge
the accuracy of childhood memories, I can only imagine that
I would have latched onto their arguments with terrific, if dangerous,
relief.


Over time, there was more than enough corroboration. Kip
was sometimes willing to talk to me, not only about Hank, but
about the the general atmosphere and certain other hazards of our

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For his part, my therapist developed a typical response to each
new remembered trauma. "So <i>that</i> was it," he'd say. "I had the
feeling we were running up against something neither of us knew
about." And then he would reassure me and tell me he was pretty
certain that we had "got it all," and I would laugh and sniffle and
make brave jokes about just how much, anyway, could one child
endure and still become a functional, even if somewhat miserable,
adult? I would feel a surge of hope that the dark days of recall
might soon be over, but soon that old mysterious undercurrent
would again be dragging at my heels.


Another telling event was mere happenstance. As an avid
reader, I have acquired a kind of foraging habit that I indulge in
libraries. I simply wander in the stacks, preferably in some unfamiliar
section, and I pull interesting books at random from the
shelves to see if I might like to read them. Foraging has led to
some delightful books I never would have known to search out.
One day, I happened upon Chris Costner Sizemore's first memoir
of her life as multiple, <i>I'm Eve</i>. I stood there idly in the stacks,
flipped it open to a page in the middle, and began read. All at
once the afternoon seemed to stop. Here on the page was a mind
that worked just like mine. After a while, it occurred to me to
glance around and see if anyone was looking. Then, selecting a
few more books to act as camouflage, I headed home.


As it turned out, I was unable to read the book from start to
finish. It was simply too much for me, and it seemed to activate
more turmoil than I could endure. I had enough of my own traumas;
reading about someone else's was simply unendurable. I did,
however, continue to open the book at random and read a few
pages here and there until I felt the first stirrings of too much

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I felt somehow enormously enlightened and relieved to read
Sizemore's realization that the only path to health lay in accepting
all of her parts and selves. I remember that I wept for hours, and
that I finally abandoned my adolescent strategy to create myself
by trying to eradicate whatever it was about myself that I didn't
like.


At my next appointment, I mentioned the book to my psychologist
and, just as I was beginning to tell him how very much
of myself and my own mind I sensed in what I had read, he cut
me off. "You are <i>not</i> a multiple," he said. "I will not allow you
to believe things are worse than they really are."


I shut up, and, in a way, I was glad to do so. After all, who
on earth would want to be a multiple? I didn't. I felt embarrassed
to have spoken up, surprised and puzzled by his vehemence, but
admittedly relieved.


A third major indicator, so easily seen in retrospect, is that
again and again I refused to do any of my work under hypnosis.
I also refused all medication--waiting a good four years to agree
even to the occasional light dose of Xanax to help with the aftermath
of nightmares. His reason for advocating both hypnosis and
medication was that the process of recalling and synthesizing
trauma seemed to be causing me too much pain and to be far too
taxing. He argued that I didn't have to suffer nearly as much as
I was because of my insistence on full, drug-free consciousness at
all times. We discussed drugs and hypnosis often, and my one
joke was that if there was a hard way to do anything I would
probably find it. Instinctively I believed I had to proceed as I was,
and, once I am convinced of something, I can be inordinately
stubborn and inflexible.


It was the hypnosis, however, that held special terrors for me.
He repeatedly explained and reassured. He went over method,

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then came the signpost he did not miss. We had often
talked about the rigid and absolute external control I wielded over
my emotions. It took four or more years, but I had gradually
learned to laugh, to cry, to grieve, and to hope. More than once,
however, he told me that sooner or later, in order to "get well,"
I would also have to get angry. We talked about rage as the result
of terror. We discussed the function of anger in human beings.
We analyzed my childhood experiences of anger in others as life-threatening,
and we decided that, in my family, anger was a kind
of license for harming others. Despite all that, he insisted that
anger was a foreign territory that I would have to enter, explore,
and endure. He suggested, in an effort to be helpful, that I might
try getting angry at him once in a while if I needed someone safe
to practice on.


But I, in turn, insisted that I would <i>never</i> get angry at him.


"Tell me why, Jane," he said more than once.


Each time, I folded my arms across my chest, tucked my chin,
and said, "You won't know me. I swear, I'm someone else when
I get mad. You'll hate me."


One day he laughed.


I refused to look at him.


"I'm a <i>shrink</i>," he said, half chuckling. "I deal with intense
emotion all day long. I'm sure I can handle whatever you dish
out."

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I held onto myself even tighter. "You don't know what you're
saying," I muttered.


"Try me," he said, holding his hands up and out as if to make
himself vulnerable. "You won't know until you try."


"You don't know what you're saying," I muttered again.


"Jane," he said, "it'll be okay. I'll know what you're doing.
I'll understand."


I shook my head; the subject was closed.


During the following months, there was a variety of changes
in his practice. His fee scale changed, my access to him between
appointments changed, the terms of our no-suicide contract
changed. Then we went through a stretch when, because of the
conferences, court appearances, and other conflicts in his schedule,
we met at erratic times. Multiples crave stability and routine, and
I found these changes frightening, chaotic, and infuriating. He
told me he felt he was bending over backward to see me every
week no matter what cropped up on his schedule; I told him that,
if he didn't want me as a patient, he should just say so. At one
point he tried to explain, as gently as he could, that I had to bear
in mind that I was paying only a token fee; I was taking up a lot
of time and bringing practically no money into the practice. "I
have a family to support," he told me. I sat and scowled out the
window and cursed myself for ever trying to trust this person or
the therapeutic process. At another point during this siege, he
took a deep breath, studied my face for a long time, then spoke
what was probably the underlying truth: "I need some distance,
Jane. I care too much about you."


I've read that multiples have a way of conjuring intense emotion
in the people around them, and that therapists are more likely
to get tangled up when treating multiples than when treating any
other kind of client. Strangely, his admission that I truly mattered
to him, although touching, was also maddening and scary.


I had spent a good deal of time over the years keeping straight

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One night, after yet another session that my therapist wanted
to spend discussing the "rules," I got mad: ripping, raging, ready-to-kill,
I-don't-care-what-happens mad. I pulled out my typewriter,
loaded it with paper as if I were loading a gun, and began
to write him a letter.


Over the years, I'd written him scores of letters. Abuses I could
not recount face to face I could pound out at the typewriter, and
I was often more willing to break new ground in writing than in
speech. Flashbacks, revelations, questions, nightmares: nearly all
were written down and many were sent along by mail. He read
them when he had the time, and from there we would begin to
talk.


That night my fingers flew over the keyboard. I filled page
after page. One thought ignited another; each remembered slight,
each past misunderstanding triggered the recollection of another.
He'd said it would be okay to get angry at him, I <i>was</i> angry at
him, and I was determined to get every last scrap of all my pent-up
rage onto the paper. I wrote in a kind of white, blinding blaze.
The typewriter hummed and clattered, the dogs dove for cover in
another room, and all the while I felt nauseated, terrified, furious,
and somehow relieved.


I was so furious that I got up twice during the night to add
postscripts, and the next morning, feeling numb and stupefied, I
took the letter from my desk, and, as I had with so many other

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Wrong.


Forty-eight hours later I had a letter back from him--sent
Federal Express. The envelope was addressed to "Ms. Jane Phillips,"
but the letter itself began: "To The Terrified Child Who
Wrote to Me on Wednesday Night." My therapist explained that,
while he knew I was scared out of my mind, it was unacceptable
to attack or vilify him. I read the letter several times, feeling
baffled and badly shaken. All I could conjure up was a vague
recollection of a night at the typewriter. It was a good guess I'd
spent that night writing him an angry letter, but I had absolutely
no idea what I had said.


At my next appointment, he stalked into the room after me,
shut the door with exaggerated control, waited until I was sitting
down, then thrust my letter toward me. His face was dark, and
he himself seemed furious.


"Did you write that?" he said.


I recoiled, then took the letter and unfolded it. But when I
tried to read it, my eyes simply would not focus, and, before I
knew it, something deep inside me was wrenching out of place.


"Did you write that?" he said again.


I thrust the letter back at him, leaned forward, and put my
head between my knees. "I don't know," I mumbled. "I guess I
must have." I thought for sure I would either vomit or black out.
I could see my hands on the arms of the chair, my feet on the
carpet, but I had no sense of touch and my vision seemed to be
doing something very odd.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'm sorry," I heard him say.


I glanced up. He seemed troubled, still somewhat angry but
shaken, too.


"Maybe I shouldn't have done that," he said after a moment.
His voice softened, although he still looked grim. "But I had to
know," he added.


I put my head back down and closed my eyes. It still seemed
to me that I would pass out. I heard him open, then close, a desk
drawer. A few minutes later, when I looked up again, the letter
was out of sight.


What <i>I</i> learned from this episode initially was that anger was
every bit as dangerous as I'd always assumed it to be. Clearly it
had rocked a working relationship carefully built over the last four
and a half years, and I doubted anything between us would ever
be remotely the same. Later I would find out that what I had
learned to call "anger" was closer to a kind of paranoiac homicidal
rage. That was what I'd grown up with. Plain old garden-variety
anger was something I would have to learn just as one learns any
foreign skill.


What my therapist learned from this fiasco was that, in some
way, I hadn't been exaggerating: his client <i>was</i> a different person
when she was angry. The tone, the logic, and the language of the
letter were completely outside his rather extensive experience with
how I thought and wrote. Showing a multiple concrete evidence
of another self is one way a therapist can bring the workings of
the disorder out into the light of day. My violent reaction to the
letter itself was a pretty clear confirmation of a tentative but as-yet-unspoken
diagnosis.


We found ourselves in very foreign territory. While in some
ways we seemed to know each other, in other ways we were strangers
once again. The old familiar trust issue came up once more,
but this time with a new wrinkle: now it was his turn to take a
chance on trusting me or we'd never get much further.


More than half a year passed between the time he read my

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first had to do with my sense of safety in his office. In
the past year, he had moved to a new office, which I had never
particularly liked. His old office had been on the first floor in the
back of a rambling commercial building. Granted the place was
dark and somewhat run down, but it had a kind of honesty about
it and a familiarity, too, since I had grown up near an old industrial
city where some of the buildings had looked much the same.
His new office, however, was on the fourth floor of an enormous
old house that had been gentrified into offices. The acoustics were
lousy, the walls were thin, and without a radio playing full blast,
conversations in his waiting room could be overheard in his consulting
room and vice versa. If you were at all quiet, you could
hear doors opening and closing on the floor below and along the
particular corridor where his office was. As a dissociator, my hair-trigger
startle reflex got a thorough workout every time I saw him
and, depending on what was going on in his outer office, there
were things I refused to talk about at all until a time I felt it
would be safer. By appearances, it was a pleasant office; for me,
however, the move had been a nightmare. We had, of course,
talked about all of this again and again, and his basic response
had been to say he was sorry but that I would just have to get
used to it as best I could.


After the conference, his attitude changed and he was at least
willing to acknowledge that it was probably unreasonable to ask
a client who'd been through what I had to sit with her back
toward a door. What mattered, he saw now, was my perception
of safety. We were never able, of course, to do anything about the

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

More importantly, he'd learned that since dissociators are going
to dissociate wherever and whenever they please--no matter
what the therapist's goals are--it was now suggested that dissociation
become open and accepted during an appointment. Before
this time, in my everyday life, when I lost track of myself, or
slipped out of my body, or could not quite remember where I was
or who I was talking to, I had somehow failed. It had been made
clear to me that the goal was to give up dissociation, forgetfulness,
and spaciness altogether.


In my view, though, it had begun to seem to me that there
were two kinds of dissociation. One, I agreed, would have to go,
and that was the dissociative state brought on by stress and fear.
And I agreed that I probably dissociated as an adult not so much
because my life was in grave danger but because it was a habit
and because there were a lot of situations I didn't know how to
handle.


But, for me, there was another kind of dissociation, when I
would let go of the tight grip I had on the workings of my mind.
I would generally lie down, stare fixedly at a wall or some simple
object, and soon the barriers of my mind would dissolve. In these
states, I was able to fully relax, and I often would slide into what
I later learned was a self-induced hypnotic trance as a way to relax,
plan my day, solve a problem, find out what I was really thinking
or how I felt. It was in this state that, to me, I seemed my wisest,
my most honest, and my most perceptive, and I had often thought
that he and I would make more progress if we could talk to one
another while I was "lying down"--my personal euphemism for
these trances.


I have seldom been so grateful for an opportunity in my life

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After that day, the direction of our work changed. He suggested
I draw a map of the various aspects of my mind and character,
and that I write descriptive pieces about whatever aspects
of myself I could identify. We would also continue the dissociative
work during appointments as I chose. The new work was a relief
to me. Every word I put on paper and every minute I spent sketching
out my map seemed to ease some of the pressure in my head.
It had taken five years, but finally, whatever the mystery was, it
seemed we were getting to it.


That summer I spent a stretch at an arts foundation. It was a
wild month. By day, I worked on a translation and tried my hand
at writing short stories. By night, at my therapist's request, I
sketched some episodes from my past which I had never before
acknowledged.


There had been the time I unaccountably found myself in a
car parked along an interstate. A nearby sign said I was 43 miles
from Cleveland. I was alone, I was in my early twenties, and I
had no idea what I was doing in Ohio. After some rummaging in
the glove compartment, I found directions to a friend's house in
Indiana. I made the wild guess that I was headed there, although
I was hundreds of miles off any reasonable route from my home

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I remembered that, as a student at a large university, I supposedly
had a double. All my apartment mates had seen her and,
assuming it was me, had spoken to her, but my supposed double
had no idea who <i>they</i> were. According to my roommates, she wore
the exact same hiking boots, carried the exact same book bag, and
owned the exact same watch as I did. "It's so <i>weird</i>," they would
say, and I would shrug and nod.


I remembered people in the French department at the same
school commenting on what a terrific dancer I was at our annual
end-of-the-year fling. Although I vaguely recalled setting out for
those parties, whoever my compatriots had seen could not have
been me: I never danced; I was too shy.


Then there was the grad school picnic at which, by all accounts,
I climbed to the top of a tall, ancient pine. This story, I
was certain, could not be true: I was afraid of heights. Once in a
while, though, I still ran into someone who recalled this feat and
reminded me of it with some awe.


It began to dawn on me that I had peculiar habits: Whenever
I traveled to a new city, I always tucked a hotel matchbook in
my pocket, so I could find my way back to where I was staying
--and so I could remember the name of the city. It abruptly
occurred to me that I faithfully filled out the emergency information
card one finds in a new wallet in case <i>I</i> might need it as
a memory prompt. Inside the back cover of each year's new pocket
calendar, I wrote my own phone number because, although I could
rattle off every phone number I'd ever had, I often had no idea
which was current. At home, when I answered my phone, I jotted
the name of the caller on a pad so that, part way into the conversation,
I would not forget who was on the other end of the
line.


In my free time, I also read Sizemore's second book, <i>A Mind</i>

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The more I thought about this last question, the more I wondered.
For starters, I reasoned, how <i>could</i> he have said anything?
At what point had there been an opportunity for him to say, "Oh,
by the way, I'm pretty sure you're a multiple"? And besides, he
and I had often talked about the dangers and limitations of labels
and diagnosis. He knew that, while I was dedicated to and worked
hard at therapy, my real goals in life were to right the skewed
learnings of a violent childhood, to put the hobgoblins of the past
to rest as much as possible, and to live a little more quietly and
calmly. And I knew he was an utterly pragmatic fellow. What
difference would it make whether or not I knew that he thought
I was a multiple? All that would probably matter to him was that
the pace of work had suddenly become so rapid and so rewarding.


For the next few months, I accepted my own reasons for his
reticence on a new diagnosis. Privately, I found the idea of multiplicity
both terrifying and appealing. Terrifying because evidence
seemed to be mounting on a daily basis: journal entries I

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During these months I often paced the house at night, debating:
I'm a multiple, I'm not a multiple. I feared just how dangerous
a step it would be to ask: would he agree? would he be
angry? I wondered just how much one should risk so that one's
life made sense. Was the heavy diagnosis of multiplicity a fair
trade for the end to all this anxiety and fear?


Unfortunately, during this time, we were once again at loggerheads
over issues of management. For instance, although my appointments
sometimes started late, he was strict about their always,
without fail, ending on time. He had also changed his booking
method and would only give me appointments four weeks at a time.
This wouldn't have been a problem, except his calendar was always
solid two weeks in advance, which meant that every other week I
had to ask for new appointments. If I asked too soon, it seemed to
annoy him. If I forgot, I was out a week's appointment.


The problems with the schedule upset me all the more because
I had begun to realize that I actually couldn't recall my entire
sessions. One week all I knew for certain was that I had lost the
afternoon. I was frightened and called him that evening to check
in. When I told him I seemed to be suffering from some kind of
memory loss, he told me not to worry. "You've been through a
lot," he said. "You're under too much stress."


"But I can't even remember <i>seeing</i> you," I said.


There was a pause. Then he said, "Try to think of it this way.
I spent the session talking directly to your subconscious."


I said nothing.


"How did you feel when you got home?" he asked. "Better?
Or worse?"

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought. "Better," I admitted grudgingly.


"For now," he said, "let's leave it at that."


Losing an afternoon is a very hard thing to leave alone. The
following week I was rigid with vigilance at my appointment. My
head ached terribly, but I remembered every last word that was
said. I was exhausted when I left, but forced myself to make a
quick stop at the drugstore after the appointment.


While waiting for my turn, I glanced around. There were the
usual pharmacy items as well as a rack of children's games and
books.


A young piping voice announced: "I want a coloring book!"


I looked at the rest of the people in the store. There was not
a single child in the place.


"I want a coloring book!"


This time, the voice was almost a wail. Once more I glanced
around. No one else seemed to hear it.


"I'm <i>not</i> buying a coloring book," I hissed back at it.


I was watching my fellow customers. No one seemed to hear
me, either.


"You didn't let me go today," accused my little internal voice.


"You've been seeing my therapist," I said, angry and astonished.


"He's <i>nice</i> to us," the voice grumped. "We go and talk about
stuff. <i>You</i> won't even get us a coloring book."


"Fine," I snapped and stepped out of line. "Get a coloring
book."


I was furious as I stood in front of the rack. To this day, I
can't quite explain how this works, but book after book was taken
from the rack, examined, then replaced. Then the debate began.
Did they want the collection of fish and sea flowers? Or the book
of castles, knights, and maidens?


"You can have <i>one</i>," I said. "Make up your mind."


They couldn't. One little voice wanted "the fish book"; the
other little voice thought the fish book was "stupid."

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, when I was calmer, it would strike me that one book
was for very young children. The pictures were large, simple, and
easy to color. The other was finely detailed. It would also strike
me that there was actually a whole chorus of young voices.


In the end, I snatched both books and stepped back toward
the counter.


"But we don't have <i>crayons</i>," someone begged inside my head.


"Jesus Christ," I said.


I stalked back to the rack, grabbed a box of crayons, and heard
an instant protest: "But we want colored <i>pencils</i>."


I grabbed a box of pencils too. At that point, I would have
bought the whole damn store just to be able to get out of there.


When I finally got to the counter to pick up my prescription
and to pay for my unexpected loot, Kevin, a pharmacist I'd known
for years, took a second look at me.


"Are you okay?" he said.


"I'm fine," I said. I was frightened and I was angry.


"You look as if you're about to pass out."


"I think I'm getting the flu."


He nodded. "Well, it's sure going around," he said, and rang
up my purchases. He handed me the bag. "Go home and get some
rest," he said.


"I will," I said.


I didn't. Or rather, <i>we</i> didn't. That entire night vanished from
my memory. My students' homework went unread, but in the
morning, on the kitchen table, I found the two coloring books: one
marked up by someone who couldn't quite color within the lines;
the other more carefully worked on by someone who preferred colored
pencils. I shuddered, swept the whole mess into a drawer,
screwed up my courage, and went to the college to teach my classes.


The following week, I fortified myself for my appointment. I
wore my wool blazer, a garment that is a kind of psychic armor
when I have to go someplace or do something unpleasant or unnerving.
Then I did something I'd never done before. I left the

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I only recall fragments of the session. I went in, sat down,
pulled my blazer tight around me, and, skipping the whole routine
of how I had been the last week or how I felt that day, I
simply announced that we had things to talk about.


My therapist has a wide and sometimes amusing range of
intonations of the word "mm-hmm." The one he used on this
occasion was wary but cool.


But then I couldn't speak, and feeling both angry and embarrassed,
I handed over my list. "I have some questions," I finally
said.


He took the list. He held it in both hands and looked down
at it. I swiveled in his chair, scowled out the window, and shot
him occasional fearful but, I hoped, determined glances.


Late afternoon light was filtering through the blinds. In the
distance, the river glittered, and the hillsides beyond the town
were brilliant with fall foliage.


Neither one of us spoke.


Finally, he said, "Do you mind if I step out for a minute?"


I nodded. What choice did I have? But it seemed just like
the old days. I was miserable, frightened, and despairing. He
couldn't even stand my presence, I thought. No one would be able
to help me. I felt so ill and so tormented, I thought I should just
give up. I would never be well, would never be myself, and I had
been a fool to try. I stood up and stared out the window. I memorized
the view. I looked straight down at the street and wondered
what would happen if I jumped. Five years and all that time and
pain and grief and hope and money. And for what? For nothing.
I seemed crazier than I'd been five years ago. There seemed to be
no point in going on.


The door opened and he came back with some papers in his

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000915503-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I'd like to give you this," he said.


He handed me a photocopy of an article. I read the title.


He nodded at the materials in my hand. "Does that answer
your first question?" he said quietly.


I stared at the article a long while. Then I rolled it into a
tube and tapped it on my leg. I got up, stared again out the
window. I let the article unroll. Reread the title. It hadn't
changed. Finally I turned. His eyes seemed somehow too alert, yet
infinitely sad. I looked straight at him.


"Yes," I said. "It does answer my question."


There was another pause.


I looked down and read the title again: "Understanding Multiple
Personality Disorder."


"So," I said, and let out a long, painful breath. "I really am
a multiple."


I knew he'd taken care to let me be the first to say the word aloud.


"Yes," he said, "you really are a multiple."


I looked around the office, then picked my way over to the
chair where I usually sat. I stared into space a good long while,
and he just sat, his old familiar self again, patient and quiet.


I told him about the voices at the drugstore and about the
fact that I'd lost nearly every evening that week to some presences
who were desperate to color in the books.


He nodded. "Those are The Kids," he told me.


"They've been coming to see you," I said.


"Yes," he said gently. "They have."


"For how long?" I wanted to know.


"A while," he told me.


"So that's how you knew," I said.


"That and other ways."


I fell silent. I felt defeated and betrayed.


"Well," I finally said, "I guess we have a lot of work to do."

"Yes," he said, "we do."


I paused. "We've already done a lot though, haven't we?" My
voice was tight with hope and desperation.


"Yes," he said. "We have."


There was another long silence. My head was roaring, my chest
and abdomen were rigid, the vision in one eye was all but gone.


"Promise me you'll stick it out?" I said. My eyes were wide
with terror. I could feel the whites briefly drying from too much
air and too little blinking.


"Yes," he said. "I'll stick it out. Will you?"


For a long while, all I did was nod and stare and study the
view out the window as if I'd never before seen leaves turn gold
and red in October.


"So I'm a multiple," I had said.


"Yes," he'd said. "You're a multiple."


So that was it--the thing that had tripped me up, the mysterious
presence that had been lurking in the far, dark corners all these
years. It meant there <i>had</i> been faces in my mirror back home in my
old bedroom--faces and voices, too. <i>I'm a multiple</i>, I thought. The
idea was startling and terrifying, yet somehow a comfort and a relief.
And I found myself thinking, not so much about The Kids as
about the older, wiser self I had consulted all those years ago. I wondered
if she was still there, waiting somewhere, wondered if she
would still be wise and strong and beautiful, wondered if she would
help me now that I so desperately needed her again.


"Where do we start?" I asked after a while. My voice was
small and shy.


"At the beginning?" he said, trying to get me to smile.


I felt a surge of panic. Where on earth <i>was</i> the beginning?


As if reading my thoughts, or glimpsing the struggles of the
future, my therapist deftly added: "Of course, first we have to <i>find</i>
the beginning."


I stared at him and wrung my hands.


"I'll help," he said. "I promise I will help."
