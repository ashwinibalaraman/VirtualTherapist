CHAPTER I


I HAVE thought of many ways to start my story. I could
begin it at a moment of triumph, when as a Hollywood
star my escorts to a world premiere were Gary Cooper
and Maurice Chevalier, when three of my pictures were
running simultaneously on Broadway, and I earned
$3,500 for an afternoon's work. That would be a glamorous
beginning.


I could begin it at an awful moment, when I stood before
an open window, behind me years of alcoholic horror
and degradation, about to leap to the pavement eleven
stories below. That would be a melodramatic beginning.


Or I could begin it at the age of thirty-four, when as
an ex-inmate of a mental institution, I was released to
start my life over again. But that might be a puzzling
beginning, and difficult for some to understand.


Perhaps, as my husband Burt suggests, the way to tell
it is the way it happened, allowing it to unfold in the
order dictated by whatever mysterious forces mold us
into the persons we become. “That's the only way it will
make sense, “he cautioned me. “Tell it as it happened.”


This is how it happened, then.


My life was never my own. It was charted before I
was born.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My parents were hopelessly stagestruck, and as a result,
I literally waited for my very first entrance cue in
a theatre. My mother, who had firm ideas about pre-natal
influence, spent as much time in theatres as she could. She
laughed and cried with Eva Tanguay and Nora Bayes
and Sarah Bernhardt, delighted to think that in some
occult fashion her enjoyment was shared by the child she
carried. She wanted me to be a singer; and because her
greatest idol, almost to the point of worship, was Lillian
Russell, I was named for her when I finally arrived on
December 13, 1910.


My father saw another future for me. He dreamed of
me as a great dramatic actress. Born Arthur Rutstein in
Russia, he had been brought to Boston, my mother's
birthplace, when he was four. Handsome, happy-go-lucky,
and gifted with contagious charm, he played a bit part
in “Peck's Bad Boy” at sixteen. To hear him describe it,
he was the star. For years my mother laughingly chided
him for never getting over it--and teased him about his
voice. Dad's voice was an off-key tenor, and temperamental
in the high ranges, but it didn't stop him from
teaming up with a friend who played the accordion, and
singing on the Boston ferry for coins tossed by the
passengers. When Dad took Mother along for the ride, during
his courtship, he called it “serenading” her. She would
sigh with the memory. “Juliet had her Romeo and I had
my Arthur. Sometimes I think I suffered more than she
did.” Actually, Mother didn't mind, because it meant
more money to go to more shows.


Arthur was 24, working in his father's produce market
by day and ushering in theatres by night, when he first
met my mother, Katie Silverman. They were married

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have often tried to trace my parents' passionate love
for the theatre. Perhaps it answered some deep need in
them. Perhaps it was the result of unfulfilled dreams
about which I never knew. My mother, a strong-willed
but emotional woman, felt that show people--those with
real talent, and she was a stern critic--were the chosen
of the gods. “We took you to see the greats and near-greats,”
she told me when I was old enough to understand.
“They all had something to offer, or they wouldn't
be up there making people laugh and cry.” She had a
small, sweet singing voice herself. “That's all I had, Lilly
baby, but there was a lot of harmony in my soul, and I
gave you that.”


Dad, however, was always acting, forever putting on
a show for us. He gave a song everything: his left hand
over his heart, his right outstretched to a cruel unfeeling
world, big tears rolled down his cheeks as he sang, “Just
a Cousin of Mine,” or “Please, Mr. Conductor, Don't Put
Me Off the Train, My Poor Old Mother is Waiting, Waiting
for Me in Pain.” I remember, in a room off the parlor,
bouncing on my little bed to the rhythm of his songs. It
was Dad who taught me recitations and despite my shyness
brought me out to recite before Sunday company.


Whatever the case, the stage was my life and that of
my sister Ann as far back as I can remember.


Ann and I were not alike. No matter how miserable I
felt when called upon to perform for guests, I never
rebelled. Dad would say, “Lillian is so good. She always
minds me. Stand up, darling, and do something for us.”
Ann, however, refused. Dad might plead, beg, threaten--

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought--and felt--many things. Looking back now,
I know that what I felt most during my childhood was
fear--and loneliness. I feared my mother's displeasure.
Though she loved me, she was a perfectionist. Quick to
kiss, she was quick to slap. Her dedication to my career
was single-minded: to her the theatre was the magic door
to everything she dreamed for her Lilly, and she would
allow nothing to get in the way. My sense of loneliness
is more difficult to explain. I was lonely for--I knew not
what. I always felt inadequate. No matter what I was
told, I thought every other child was prettier, more
charming, more likable--in short, nicer than I. I never
liked the person I was, and later, I found alcohol helped
me run away from myself.


In 1916 we moved to New York, to a cold-water walk-up
on 43rd Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues.
Arthur, who was always going to make a million, thought
he'd find more opportunities in the big city. Even more
important was the fact that New York was the center of
show business.


Hearing that jobs were available for talented little girls,
Katie used to dress Ann and me each morning near the
coal stove in the kitchen, and then make the rounds with
us of the producers and theatrical agents. Their offices
were invariably crowded. Each was like the other--a

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was to be my first assignment in show business, to
pose as Educational Pictures' screen trademark, a living
statue holding a lamp of knowledge.


Katie's excitement as she signed me in possessed me
too. It was always to be like that. Her wish became mine.
In later years I always looked into the wings, where she
stood during my act, to see what her face said. A smile
meant I had done well. The merest shadow of a frown,
that my performance wasn't perfect, no matter what the
critics wrote the following morning.


Now, in preparation for my first job, she undressed me
and a fatherly looking old gentleman with a cigar
clenched in his teeth started to paint me with white body
makeup. When lunch time came, Katie left me in his
charge while she and Ann went out to buy sandwiches
for all of us, including the old gentleman. Left alone with
me, he went to the door, looked outside, and locked it.
“Cold in here,” he said. I had been standing on a box.
“Better lie down, where it's warm,” he said, taking me in
his arms and carrying me to a couch near the stove. He
painted my thighs, then worked his brush upwards and
began painting me where it made me uneasy.


He daubed me with the brush, again and again, on the
same part of my anatomy. The cigar moved from one
corner of his mouth to the other, and then back again.
“Only five years old,” he said. “My, you're a nice little
girl.”

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I covered my eyes with my hands. I knew there was
something wrong in what he was doing, but I couldn't
stop him or cry for help. If Katie found out, something
terrible would happen. She would scream, her face would
contort, and I could not bear to hear her scream or to
see her face like that.


When he heard her footsteps in the hall, he hurriedly
unlocked the door and stood me up on the box again; he
was just finishing my feet when Katie came in and spread
out our lunch.


An unknown fear held my tongue. I never told her.
But for years afterward I dreamed constantly about a
man with a cigar in his mouth, who locked me up in a
room and did dreadful things to me. A popular Admiration
Cigar advertisement at the time pictured a smiling,
moon-faced man with a cigar in his mouth, and he was
repeated, cigar and face, on and on into infinity, growing
smaller and smaller in the background. Whenever I
caught sight of him in subway or trolley ads, I shut my
eyes tightly and hid my face in Katie's skirts until all his
heads faded away.


Katie learned that Sam Goldwyn was producing motion
pictures in Fort Lee, New Jersey, across the Hudson
River. If Educational Films could use me, why not Goldwyn?
Each morning we took the long trip by bus, ferry
and bus again, Katie, Ann and I. Once in the barracks-like
studios, we waited hopefully for calls as extras--we
two among perhaps a hundred children, with their
mothers. We were always cold. Someone distributed tin
cups of hot coffee, and Katie hurried about looking for
hot water to dilute it for us. We stood, sometimes for

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“What are you doing, Mommy?” I asked her once.


“I'm earning three dollars, too, today. Now I'll be able
to buy you that little muffler you wanted.”


One day we waited a long time. We grew blue with
cold. Suddenly she exclaimed, “The devil with this! My
children aren't going to freeze!” She bundled us up, took
us all the way back home, and put us to bed under warm
blankets. It was like a party, we told each other: we had
never been home so early in the day before. “Babies,”
she said, “I'm going to heat some nice big rolls for you,
with lots of butter and hot cocoa, and I'm going to bring
it to you right in bed.”


After our treat, she read us the Sunday comics until
we fell asleep.


Later Ann and I were rewarded with steady acting
jobs. While Ann played Theda Bara as a child on one
set, on the other I was an angel in white gauze and lace,
waiting to be born. We angels stood perched on a high
platform facing a row of dazzling Kleig lights. Just before
the action began, a man shouted a warning, “Children,
don't look at the lights!”


They flashed on. I blinked, then stared, fascinated.
As I watched, they changed shape; the slender incandescent
spiral in the center became a winged man, then
a glowing giant, growing taller and taller yet remaining
the same.


We were homeward bound later, and I was trailing
Mother, who was carrying Ann, when my eyes began to

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She thought I was playing a game. “What are you
talking about, Lilly?” she asked over her shoulder. “I'm
right in front of you.”


“Mommy, I can't find you, I can't see you,” I wailed.


She put Ann down and grabbed me up. I felt the
pounding of her heart. She began to run, crying hysterically.
“Oh, my baby, my baby,” and I clung to her, my
arms around her neck, my eyes feeling as though a million
needles were stuck in them.


The doctor called it “Kleig eyes,” and prescribed a rest
in bed for me. My father comforted me. “Baby,” he said,
“you'll get used to those lights and become a great actress.
Let's start right now.” He taught me, “The Making
of Friends,” by Edgar A. Guest. I still remember the
words, for they were my first dramatic lines.


They began:


“If nobody smiled and nobody cheered<br />
And nobody helped us along,<br />
If every each moment looked after itself<br />
And the good things all went to the strong...”


“What's the use of that?” my mother asked. “She needs
ballet, and singing lessons, and so many things--”


“She'll have those, too,” said Dad. “But right now I
want her to learn this, with all the hand motions, with
expression!”


Quite without warning, I had to test my dramatic skill
on Dad himself. Katie got word that children were being
interviewed for parts in the film, “The Bluebird,” and
hurried down with me. Several children and their mothers

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Katie and I and the others straggled out disconsolately.
I sensed rather than knew that Mother was boiling.


It came like an explosion once we were outside. “Why
didn't you get up when he pointed at you!”


“No he didn't, Mommy. He wanted that little Violet
Mae sitting next to me.”


My mother walked faster. I ran along in the snow,
frightened, tripping, trying to keep up with her as she
strode along. “He pointed at you and you wouldn't stand
up!” Turning suddenly, she slapped me. The blow struck
me as I tripped forward toward her: I was knocked off
balance into the snow.


She cried out with horror. “Oh, my poor baby! What
have I done!” She picked me up, and almost beside herself,
began to cuddle and kiss me. My left eye was beginning
to puff. “Oh, God, look what I've done!” And then,
“Oh, my God, what will your father do when he finds
out!”


She was rocking me in her arms, both of us crying. I
smothered my mother's face with kisses. “Don't worry,
Mommy,” I managed to get out. “We can tell him I fell
against this lamppost, can't we?” I pointed to one conveniently
near.


“Oh, he won't believe it,” she said miserably.


“Yes, he will. I <i>could</i> have slipped...”


We memorized our story on the way home. My father
was in the kitchen when we arrived. When he saw me
he uttered an exclamation. “Come over here, Lillian!

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Let me look at that eye!”


I walked over slowly, my fingers crossed behind my
back so that I could tell a fib without being a bad girl.


“How did this happen?”


“I slipped and fell against a lamppost, Daddy. It was
very icy--”


My father looked up suspiciously at Katie, then back
at me.


“Is that the truth?” he demanded.


“Yes it is, Daddy,” I said stoutly. “And I can show you
the place, too.”


He surely knew then that I could not be telling the
truth, but he only grumbled as Katie, maintaining a discreet
silence, wrung out a cloth in water and held it
tenderly to my eye.


I missed the part in “The Bluebird,” but Ann and I
played Constance and Norma Talmadge as children; then
I was Evelyn Nesbit as a child; then we were cast to
play General Pershing's daughters in the film, “Pershing's
Crusaders.”


Dad's dramatic coaching led only to such bit parts until
one January afternoon when a crowd of us children were
gathered on an icy Fort Lee hillside. We had been instructed
to watch the child stars of the picture kiss each
other before they tobogganed down the snowy slope.
Wesley Barry, the freckle-faced male star, approached
his leading lady to embrace her. But the scenarist hadn't
reckoned with feminine modesty. Wesley's leading lady
wouldn't kiss him.


Instead, she dissolved in tears and refused to go on.


The director threw out his arms despairingly. “What
do we do now?” he demanded.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I'll do it,” I piped up. I was astounded to hear myself
say it. The idea of kissing a boy was shocking to me. I
could feel the shame burning my face as everyone turned
to look at me: if I could have sunk into a snowbank, I
would have. But perhaps I was inspired by the disastrous
memory of what had happened earlier when I wasn't on
my toes. In any case, Mother was beaming, and that was
the important thing.


An onlooker called me over after the camera had taken
its closeup. “What's your name?” he asked.


“Lillian Roth,” I said.


He smiled. “My name's Roth, too.” He turned to my
mother. “I'm casting a show for the Shuberts and I'd like
to see your child tomorrow. I think she's just the type.
We're looking for a sad, pensive little girl.”


Next day I was in his office. “Honey, can you do a little
acting for me?” Mr. Roth asked.


“Oh, yes,” I replied. “My daddy taught me ‘The Making
of Friends,’ and I could do that for you.” I recited it,
with expression. When Katie brought me home, I ran to
my father and told him the good news. I had been cast
for Wilton Lackaye's little daughter in “The Inner Man,”
a full-fledged Broadway production.


Daddy was jubilant. “See, Katie, what did I tell you!”
He picked me up, threw me into the air, and kissed me.
“She's going to be a great dramatic actress. A tragedienne
--that's what. Why, she'll be making $1,500 a week in no
time!”


I had just turned six.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER II


TRAGEDIENNE or not, I had to go to school, and during
the run of “The Inner Man” Katie enrolled me in the
Professional Children's School. Classes were held only
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., but in the four hours you crammed
a full day's school work, including diction and French.


After classes Katie took me home, and when we were finished
with dinner, made me up for my role as Mr. Lackaye's
daughter. I soon discovered there was a great difference
between reciting Edgar Guest--even with expression--and
performing on the stage. “The Inner Man” called for me to
sit on the lap of Mr. Lackaye, who played a criminal finally
redeemed by the faith of his little girl. One of my poignant
lines was “Daddy, Daddy, won't you PULLEASE come
home with me?”


Mr. Lackaye gave me my first professional dramatic
lesson.


“A play tells a story and you must pretend it's really
happening,” he explained. “You must pretend there's nobody
in the theatre--no audience, no one back stage--
just you and me and the other actors. You must pretend
I'm your real father. And remember--never, <i>never</i> look
at the audience.”


He said this last so solemnly that my skin crawled.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I almost screamed. Before me, as far as my eye could
reach, was a weird ocean of pale, disembodied heads
floating in a gray, ghostly dusk. I buried my face in my
stage father's shoulder, and tried to catch my breath.
There was something about Mr. Lackaye that was
strangely comforting. I snuggled closer: the odor of
tweed, the fragrance of talcum, and through it all, the
familiar, sweet scent of whiskey--why, I thought, it was
just like being on my real daddy's lap!


The Professional Children's School was made to order
for those of us already working. If you had rehearsals or
matinees, your schedule was arranged accordingly, and
there were even correspondence lessons if you went on
tour.


As at other schools, the mothers waited outside for
classes to let out, but since they were stage mothers,
their conversation was studded with Broadway names
and punctuated by the rustle of newspaper clippings
passed from hand to hand. My classmates' rollcall read
like a theatrical <i>Who's Who</i> of the future: Ruby Keeler,
Patsy Kelly, Milton Berle, Ben Grauer, Helen Chandler,
Gene Raymond, Penny Singleton, Helen Mack, Marguerite
Churchill, Jerry Mann, and many others.


Sometimes I got out earlier than the other students and
overheard the mothers on their favorite subject--the talent
of their offspring. For example, Mrs. Grauer: “I really
think my Bunny has one of the finest speaking voices
I've ever heard.”

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Don't I know?” This from Katie. “Didn't I hear him
recite ‘The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere'? He was wonderful.”’


Or Sarah Berle, with whom mother often played
casino: “Katie, you should have heard Milton at the
benefit last night! He tore the house down. When he did
Cantor, you'd have sworn it was Cantor. And when he
got down on one knee to do Jolson--”


Mother would interrupt: “Shubert came to him and
said, ‘Get down on both knees, and Jolson goes!’”


They all laughed. They were proud of their children,
and if Katie carried no clippings in her purse, it was because,
as she once told me, “I didn't have to carry proof,
Lilly. Your name was up in lights.”


Milton Berle, who was several grades ahead of me but
delighted in teasing me, did impressions, and even in
those days he was accused of stealing someone else's act.
Katie had taught Ann and me to save our acting for on
stage: off stage we had to be perfect little ladies, like
the little girls on Park Avenue. I couldn't understand this,
because Milton acted all over school. The moment the
teacher left the room, he was running up and down the
aisles, clapping his hands a la Eddie Cantor, and sending
the rest of us into gales of laughter.


The prettiest of my schoolmates, I thought, was Ruby
Keeler. I admired her slim, tapering hands. Mine were
stubby, and looked even worse because I bit my nails.
I was so self-conscious of my hands that I hid them when
I talked; so nobody could see them, I snatched at pencils
and books, succeeding only in dropping everything so
often that I was nicknamed “Butterfingers.” Dr. Coué was
the rage then, so I pulled hopefully at my fingers and

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I hid my hands, so for a long while I hid my voice.
I knew Katie wanted me to be a singer, and I tried. Dad
was always singing about the house. I followed suit. One
afternoon, I was singing at the top of my voice, “I'm
Forever Blowing Bubbles,” the current hit, when Katie
looked up from her copy of <i>Variety</i>. “Oh, Lilly,” she said,
“that bubble really broke. That last note was way off
key.” She shook her head. “Just like your father--you
can't even carry a tune.”


I never forgot her words.


After that I sang in secret, practicing in the bathroom
where I turned the taps on full strength in the tub to
drown out my voice. The rushing water became my
orchestral accompaniment: it became drums, oboes, bass
fiddles. I <i>would</i> be a singer when I grew up. I would
make Katie proud of me.


Katie, to be sure, overlooked few chances for me. After
“The Inner Man” closed, a stock company put out a call
for a little boy, and I was turned down. Katie hurried me
home, dressed me in a velvet Lord Fauntleroy suit borrowed
from a neighbor, and rushed me back. “This is my
son, Billy,” she said. I felt utterly disgraced, but I got
the part.


Then Katie got word that Henry W. Savage was casting
“Shavings,” and had interviewed scores of children
for a 50-page part. She had to be with Ann, who was

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Under orders, I approached the “Nothing doing” girl
timidly, but with determination. “I would like to see Mr.
Henry W. Savage,” I announced. She peeked over the
desk to find me. “I'm sorry, little girl, but you can only
see Mr. Savage by appointment.”


“Oh, well,” I said. “I have an appointment.”


She coughed to hide a smile, disappeared into the next
room, and returned a moment later to say Mr. Savage
would see me.


I walked into the adjoining room and stopped, transfixed.
Behind a desk an enormous man was getting to his
feet, rising taller and taller, until when he reached his
full six feet four he seemed to tower over me like the
giant in <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i>. He was tremendous--
massive, broad-shouldered, white-haired--with a voice to
match. It boomed out, rattling the ashtrays on his desk.
“Good afternoon, young lady. I hear we have an appointment.”


I forgot all about my fib. “My mother told me you want
a little girl to play a part in a toy shop,” I managed to
stammer.


He looked down at me from his awful height. Suddenly
he said, “How would you ask me, ‘Are you the windmill
man?’”


All at once it came to me. That's who he looks like--
Thor, the God of Wind and Thunder. “Are <i>you the windmill</i>
man?” I asked, in great awe. For all I knew, he was.


Mr. Savage said, “You have the part.”

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Shavings” put my name in lights for the first time. Just
turned eight, I was billed as “Broadway's Youngest Star.”
Interviews with me were syndicated throughout the
country. Wherever I turned, my face stared back at me,
for photographs of Lillian and her one-eyed rag doll
Petunia were placarded on subway pillars, telegraph
poles and billboards.


Neither my photographs nor the growing scrapbook
my parents kept meant much to me. What was exceptional
about doing what you were told? Often I felt I'd have
more fun with Ann playing Red Cross Nurse, helping the
poor Belgian children orphaned by the Germans, a game
all the other neighborhood children played. Now and
then I stood in the wings and watched the rest of the
show, but my eyelids would grow heavy, and Katie
would take me into a dressing room, spread my coat over
two chairs, and I would nap there until I was due onstage
again.


Our home life, what we had of it, held little but indecision--and
quarrels. My success, and Ann's during our
early years, only stressed our insecurity. We seemed
either to be transients, away on tour, or, when we were
at home, caught in endless bickering between our
parents.


When Dad courted Katie, he was known as the handsomest
boy on the block, she as the girl with the most
personality. My mother was not beautiful, but she had
an enchanting smile, and an immediate, warm sympathy
that made her everyone's confidant. Arthur's charm was
unmistakeable. Away from home he was merry and fun-loving,
immensely popular. He began as a good-time

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dad had big dreams. He tried his hand at everything,
but never succeeded in becoming the man he wanted to
be in the eyes of his wife and his children. He sold produce,
then greeting cards, then men's clothing; he was
a stock and bond salesman; he even operated a waffle
shop. One failure followed another. Each time he tried
to pass it off lightly. “Well, Katie,” he would say, “that
wasn't for me, anyway.” And he would take a drink to
forget it. I am sure, now, that ambitious as he was for
us, his ego must have been hurt by the fact that Ann and
I earned more than he, and that he was always going
from job to job.


In time his drinking made him irritable and suspicious.
Once, I remember, he accused Katie of poisoning our
minds against him. She snapped, “If you ever saw yourself
when you're full of whiskey--how can they love you when
you frighten them to death?” I watched, terrified of the
blow that might come: once I had seen him strike her.
I knew how explosive their tempers were.


As it worked out, however, we were separated from
Dad for long stretches from my 9th to my 15th year. For
after “Shavings” Ann and I became vaudeville headliners
on the Keith Circuit, and Mother travelled with us. This
meant three to four months on the road, then back to
New York for a brief layoff, and back on the road again.
Our act was “Lillian Roth &amp; Co.” Ann was the “&amp; Co.”
until her great sense of comedy caused Katie to change
the billing to “The Roth Kids.”

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did dramatic impersonations--impressions of Ruth
Chatterton in “Daddy Long Legs,” and of “Pollyanna,”
which I abhorred because she was “always glad all over.”
My greatest thrill came in my impersonation of John and
Lionel Barrymore in the duelling scene from “The Jest.”
Here I could be the extrovert on stage that I could never
be in real life. First I was John, taking my duelling
stance, rapier in hand, my eyebrows cocked. “Methinks
thou art a cur!” Lunge, and back again. “Thou buzzard!”
I roared. Jab, and dance away. Then, in an instant, I
whirled about and became Lionel, transformed into the
wily, cunning cackling-voiced swordsman who parried
John's violent thrusts with consummate disdain... The
audience watched, silent and intent, and I was in raptures.
I knew power, I glowed with the magic of the
theatre, I felt the audience in the palm of my hand.


Then, bathed in perspiration and triumph, I bowed to
thunderous applause and turned the stage over to Ann.
My sister proceeded to throw herself into a brilliantly
hilarious satire of my act. She burlesqued me down to
the contemptuous curl of my imaginary mustache. The
audience howled, and I suffered. The tragedienne in me
was deeply hurt.


We played on bills with such headliners as Georgie
Jessel, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Ben Bernie, and
the Marx Brothers, and Katie taught us to curtsy to all
of them, as was only proper with older persons. Rosie
Green of Keno &amp; Green, a comedy song and dance act,
carried her baby, Mitzy, around in a little basket, and I
often stopped to coo at her as she lay backstage laughing
and gurgling.

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“See my baby,” Rosie once said to me. “She's going to
grow up to be a great impersonator, too. Just like you,
Lillian.”


“Like me? Gosh,” I said, flattered. I was all of 10 years
old.


Once, in Washington, D. C, Ann and I were told that
the President of the United States was in his box that
afternoon. After the show the stage manager hurriedly
knocked at our dressing room door. “The President wants
to see you, kids!” he exclaimed.


Still in our costumes, we rushed out the stage entrance
into the back alley, and there they were, President Wilson
and the first lady, sitting in a huge open touring car.
The President asked us to get in. Ann sat on his lap. I
sat shyly between him and Mrs. Wilson.


“What a serious little girl you are, both on and off the
stage,” the President said to me. “You know, I am going
to make a prediction, young lady. Some day you will be
a great actress.” Then he turned to Ann. “And you, my
dear, you were utterly delightful. Mrs. Wilson and I
haven't laughed so much in a long time.”


I found my voice and thanked him. Ann, busy examining
and fingering the interior of the luxurious car, piped
up, to my mortification, “Ooh, what a big auto! My daddy
has a tin lizzie.” The President smiled and turned to Mrs.
Wilson. “Shall we take our little guests for a ride around
the block?” Away we drove. When we emerged into the
street outside, it was jammed with people held back by
police on both sides. They waved and applauded as we
passed by, and then we were brought back to the stage
entrance again.


“Goodbye, little girls, and stay sweet,” Mrs. Wilson

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mostly, however, vaudeville on the road was a hard
life, made up of lonely train rides (even now a train
whistle fills me with haunting sadness), lonely nights in
strange hotels, and lonely cities in which we knew no
one. “The Roth Kids” in lights in town after town meant
little to us. Wistfully Ann and I looked out the train windows,
watching the endless procession of backyard gardens
flow by, catching a glimpse of little family groups,
of children playing with their pets, of mother and father
contentedly together on a back porch. We yearned for a
home, a garden, a hammock, a sense of belonging.


Like prisoners Mother, Ann and I counted off the days
until we got back to New York. “Where do we go next,
Mommy?” I would ask. Katie would produce a long slip
of green paper. “Hattfield, for three days.” “Then where,
Mommy?” “Pittsfield, for a split week.” And so it was--
four days, three days, and week stands, month after
month.


But when we returned to New York--and Dad--there
were only arguments after the affectionate greetings of
the first few hours. For added to Dad's uncontrollable
temper was his jealousy.


“Did Mother ever leave you alone between shows,” he
would ask, taking me aside. “Was she with you all the
time?”


I knew Mother went nowhere. Time and again I awakened
to see her sitting beside us, reading by the little
table light, reluctant to slip into bed with us because of

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once she was sure of it. She woke us, frantically.
“Babies--babies--get up, hurry up, there's a man after
us!


She could hardly dress Ann in her panic. My fingers
were all thumbs as I tried to button my clothes. I was
sick with the terror on my mother's face. I went into a
cold sweat. My heart pounded in my ears. I was sure
something monstrous was breathing in the room.


Then we were rushing out and down the stairs into the
dimly lit lobby and Mother was screaming at the lone
desk clerk--not knowing but that he might have been the
man himself. Then we were running through the dark
streets, my mother shrieking for help, until we found
another place to spend the night. But there was no more
sleep.


Once I woke to find her brushing things off us. “What
are you doing, Mommy?” I asked sleepily. “Get out of
bed,” she said excitedly. “It's full of bedbugs!” Minutes
later she had us dressed and furiously rushed us out of
the hotel.


The streets of the small towns were always deserted
late at night when we walked from the theatre to our
hotel. What might not be lurking behind every tree,
every shadow? Sometimes we heard footsteps behind us.
We hurried, and the footsteps quickened, and I was limp
with fear until we reached the bright lights of the hotel.


Back in New York the arguments grew more bitter. I
was in an agony of shame when my father began his
accusations, sometimes behind the locked door of their

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once, a quarrel broke out between them in the kitchen.
They began to struggle, and something exploded in me.
“Stop it!” I screamed hysterically. “Stop it, I can't stand
it!” I grabbed my glass piggy bank and threw it with all
my might between them, trying to separate them. It
crashed against the wall. My parents, startled, turned to
me, and a moment later I was in Katie's arms, and we
were both sobbing.


Dad was all remorse. He took a quick drink and then
another. “How could I do this to my Katie! To my Lilly!”
He began to cry. “They can string me up from a tree if
I ever lay a hand on you again, Katie!”


My mother could only shake her head. “You and your
crocodile tears.” She wept, and took me into the bedroom,
where Ann slept, undisturbed.


On another occasion, at a gathering, a handsome man
engaged Katie in a long, bantering conversation. Dad's
face grew pale. He was in an ugly mood when we came
home. For a while he drank silently.


Then--“Will you be good enough to tell me--” he began,
grinding his teeth as he always did when he was
about to explode.


“Arthur. The children...”


Praying they would not fight, I tiptoed to bed. But
suddenly I heard piercing screams. I leaped out of bed
and ran into the kitchen. My mother lay on the floor,
blood trickling from the corners of her mouth, her eyes
puffed, her face bruised. She was rolling wildly back and
forth, screaming uncontrollably, catching her breath, then

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father, a long red gash on his face, was in his
bathrobe, slumped in a chair, his eyes glassy, a bottle
beside him. He moaned to himself, “Oh my God, Lillian
what did I do?”


He rose, as if to go to my mother, but she shrieked,
“Don't come near me--don't touch me!” He fell back into
his chair.


I pulled her to a couch and cradled her head in my lap,
while my father repeated dully, “Do something, Lillian,
do something.” I was sick to my stomach with fear and
horror, and with a compassion I could not put into words.
My mother moaned and wept, and my father slumped
in his chair, looking at nothing.


I spent the remainder of the night running between
the living room, where my mother lay weeping, and the
kitchen, where my father sat staring at the wall, and
drinking. Katie fell asleep, finally, but I was in the kitchen
every few minutes, tugging at my father's arm, shaking
him, imploring him, “Please don't fall asleep, Daddy,
please, please!” I did not know what I feared, but I knew
he had to remain awake, he <i>had</i> to remain awake.


For years afterward there were many nights that I
could not fall asleep until daylight came through my bedroom
window.

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER III


I WAS TWELVE when Katie, seeking new stage personalities
for me to impersonate, took me to see Lenore
Ulric in “Kiki.” I fell in love with her. What fire and
passion in her performance! Oh, I thought, if only I could
be like her!


At Katie's suggestion I took enough courage to write
her a note, and she invited me to her home. I trembled
as I rang the bell.


Miss Ulric herself opened the door. I was overwhelmed
for a moment by this exotic, vibrant personality, dressed
in beautiful black satin pajamas.


“Oh, Miss Ulric, I'm Lillian Roth who wrote you about
impersonating you,” I burst out.


“Good heavens,” were her first words. “You look
enough like me to be my twin. A little twin!”


“Oh, thank you, Miss Ulric,” I said breathlessly. “That's
what many people tell me, and you're my idol!”


She put her arms around me and kissed me. Then, to
her maid, “Bring in some cake and milk.” She turned to
me. Was there any scene in the play I would like to do?


I told her it was the scene in which Kiki, brandishing
a stiletto, turns on the society lady who seeks to steal her
lover and cries, “I am a Corsican! My father is Corsican!

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I seized the cake knife and launched into her scene.


“Wonderful! Wonderful!” she applauded. <i>“Very, very</i>
good. But you must lower your voice deep into your
throat, and you must run your hand wildly through your
hair.” She did the scene several times for me, and then
later said, “If you feel you haven't the characterization
just right, come back.”


I added Helen Mencken, Judith Anderson and Jeanne
Eagels to my repertoire. How electric Jeanne Eagels was
in “Rain,” how alive--every move, every turn, a picture.
Oh, I thought, to be a dramatic actress! What was vaudeville
compared to the legitimate stage--a full three hour
show in which you felt so deeply, in which you reached
out and touched people's <i>souls</i>.


Suddenly Dad was in the big money. While we were
on tour, he had gotten a job as head salesman for a Fifth
Avenue clothier and earned as much as $300 a week. He
used much of it, plus some of our money, for “investments.”
He was always going to hit on something that
would bring us a fortune overnight. Then, he promised,
he would buy us everything we wanted, including the
house and garden.


Now that he was doing well, Katie was finally able to
realize one of her dreams--a private school for us. She
decided to take us out of show business for a year, so
that I could attend Clark School of Concentration, a fashionable
cram school. My one term here, as it turned out,
completed my formal education.


I entered Clark like the little lady Katie wanted me to

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Today when I come upon John Held, Jr's drawings of
flappers in the fabulous 20's, I see myself. Silk blouse,
dangerously short skirt, rolled stockings, red garters with
bells, long fluffy bob (after Ulric), and a vanity case
piled high with makeup and cigarettes. I didn't smoke.
But the advertisement read, “Be nonchalant. Light a
Murad.” And I wanted to be nonchalant, I wanted to be
sophisticated.


But I knew the picture I saw of myself was wrong.
For I was anything but nonchalant. I was impatient, impatient
for I knew not what, driven by an energy I could
not control. I seemed to have a clock ticking in me faster
than any one else's: time itself could not move swiftly
enough. I was full of anxieties--whether people liked me,
whether my acting was adequate, whether I was as good
as I should be.


Often I discussed this with my best friend, Minna
Gellert. She was a year older, a shy girl who wrote
poetry. Until I met her, at 13, I had not even had a close
friend. I envied the serene atmosphere of her home, and
I envied her poetic ability. That, I thought, was real
talent. And although I was busy with rehearsals, dancing,
music, acrobatics, I felt they were mundane accomplishments.
I was discontented, tormented by an inner compulsion

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Lillian,” she would reply in her slow, calm way. “It's
only that you have all that creative ability in you. Just
give yourself a chance. You haven't found yourself yet.”
And so she soothed me.


The classmate I was most interested in at Clark was
Leo Fox, a tall, dark, curly-haired boy of 17. I concentrated
the Ulric look on him in history class one day, and
soon he was taking me for ice-cream sodas and Saturday
night movies. He was my first flame. The girls tagged
him “Lillian's sheik.” Another schoolmate was Carl
Laemmle, Jr., whose father was president of Universal
Pictures. He called for me in a chauffeur-driven Stutz
Bearcat, the last word in rakish automobiles, and we
talked about the movies of tomorrow. On our first date
he put his arm around me and in a warm, confidential
voice, murmured, “You know, Lillian, some day I'll be a
big Hollywood producer.” “Oh, yes,” I said, deftly extricating
myself. “My father always says, ‘Talent will out.’”
Junior took the hint.


Besides, hadn't a critic in the New York <i>World</i> written:
“Thirteen year old Lillian Roth is a real find. She has a
dramatic sense unusual in one so young, a dramatic intensity
which bids fair to see her go far on the road to
stardom.”


Toward the end of my school term, Willie Howard, the

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He jotted something down on his calling card. “Here,”
he said, “Tell Lillian to take this to Jake Shubert and say
Willie Howard sent her.”


The following Monday, having cut classes, I was ushered
into Mr. Shubert's presence. After all, Willie
Howard had written: “Dear J. J. This is Lillian Roth.
Star material.”


Mr. Shubert looked on either side of me, then caught
me in a swift, sidewise glance--a habit of his--and asked
softly, “What can you do?”


“I'm a dramatic actress,” I announced.


“Sorry, little girl.” He turned away. “We're casting for
‘Artists and Models.’ I need singers.”


“I sing, too,” I said, my fingers crossed.


“All right,” he said, after a moment. “Come back at
nine o'clock. I'll hear you.”


At the appointed hour I found nearly 200 persons--the
entire cast--onstage. Was I to audition before all of them?
Mr. Shubert walked into the empty theatre. “Go ahead,”
he flung over his shoulder. “Sing!”


Standing in the midst of the cast, and still in hat and
coat, I sang “Red Hot Momma.” Mr. Shubert was somewhere
out in the darkness, but I couldn't see him. Well,
I thought with a sinking feeling, I guess Katie was right
about my singing. I began to leave the stage.


“Where are you going?” came his voice. “Let's have
another number.”


I tossed off my hat and coat and gave everything to
“Hot Tamale Mollie.”

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Silence. Then Mr. Shubert's voice rumbled, “How old
are you?”


“I'm going on fifteen.”


“Wait around. I'll talk to you later.”


After the auditions he asked if I knew the regulations
of the Gerry Society, which looked after juveniles in the
theatre. I was too young to sing or dance in New York.
But, he said, “I'll put you in my Chicago company. We
can change your age there. From now on, you're 18,
Lillian.”


I ran all the way home and barged into our apartment.
“Mom,” I shouted, “meet your 18-year-old singing soubrette--the


star of ‘Artists and Models!’”


My mother almost fell off her chair.


I was not, of course, the star of “Artists and Models,”
but I was a singer--and being paid for it. The joy, however,
was not quite what I expected. For Mr. Shubert
might change my age, but I was still 14--and “Artists and
Models” shocked me. It introduced me to nudity--and to
headaches, the kind of headaches I suffered later whenever
I couldn't cope with a situation. I shared a hot,
sticky cellar dressing room with 20 showgirls who posed
in the finale uncovered from the waist up. I had never
undressed before another girl, and the nonchalance with
which they strolled about backstage with hardly a stitch
on, and the equal near-nudity of the chorus boys, who
called each other “Betty” and “Mildred,” distressed me.


When I complained of headaches, Marie Stoddard, a
kindly woman who played character parts in the show,
took me in hand. “Christian Science can help you,” she
said. She gave me a copy of Mary Baker Eddy's <i>Science</i>

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Lillian,” she said to me one afternoon, when my head
seemed gripped in a vise and I had to hold back the
tears, “your pain is only a dream. Try to understand that,
dear. You are part of God's mind, and God's mind sees
no evil and feels no evil.” She sat beside my cot and was
so gentle and persuasive that often my headaches seemed
to vanish. She spoke constantly of Jesus Christ. “Many of
the Jewish faith read Christian Science,” she assured me.
“It doesn't interfere with their creed. It merely tries to
prove that we are all part of one mind--the mind of God.”


As I once tried Dr. Coué for my hands, I now invoked
Christian Science for my headaches, wandering about repeating,
“I have no headache... My headache isn't
real....”


The chorus boys liked me and used to protest to Katie
that she wasn't letting me grow up. “Why don't you get
her out of those skirts and blouses? Her figure is developing
beautifully.” They showed me how to bead my eyelashes
and even whipped up a sophisticated dress for me.
“Never laugh at the way they act or talk,” Katie warned
me. “They're born that way. They have a marvellous
sense of humor and they can be wonderful company.”


Since there wasn't anyone my age in the show and I
was lonely, it wasn't surprising that Katie allowed me to
go to a company party one Saturday night. Immediately
after the show the full company piled into half-a-dozen
automobiles. I was taken by the stage manager, who
promised he'd bring me back safe and sound. We drove

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once inside, I gaped. Were these men--or women?
They wore hats pulled down to one side, carried canes,
wore monocles, cigarettes dangled from their lips; they
wore stiff collars and ties, tight, narrow skirts, low-heeled
shoes, three quarter coats. Then I got it. These were
chorus boys in reverse! But boys were there, too. The
girls called other girls “Bob” and “Johnny,” and the boys
whistled and shrieked at each other. Nearly everyone got
drunk. For most of the party I sat in a corner, wide-eyed,
drinking sasparilla and taking it all in.


A boy wiggled himself into a beaded outfit and did the
shimmy. A girl danced nude on a table. Women danced
wildly with other women; then every few minutes a pair
would disappear to another part of the barn, out of sight.
I felt a little ill. Vaguely I knew there was something
dark and wrong here, but nothing quite crystallized in
my mind.


I asked my escort, “What are they doing? Where are
they going together?”


He laughed, and shrugged it off, and the mystery remained.


When I came home Katie asked sleepily, “Did you
enjoy yourself, baby?”


“Fair, Mom,” I said. “Nobody asked me to dance.”


I didn't know how to begin to tell her.


Shortly after this Katie took me out of the show, pleading
illness. My headaches had become worse, and the
best the doctors could advise, finding nothing organically
wrong, was a change of scene. It was just as well, Katie
said. “Artists and Models” was no place for a girl my age.

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We returned to New York.


“All you need, darling,” said Katie, “is a good rest.”
And then she placed balm upon my head. “You've proved
yourself a singer, you dance beautifully, you act well--
you're going to become a big musical comedy star!”

CHAPTER IV


IF ANYONE typified the years in which I was coming to
womanhood, it was Texas Guinan. Those were the years
of Harding and Coolidge, of marathon dances and the
Charleston, of Peaches Browning and Rudolph Valentino
and Lucky Lindy.


I had just finished a Keith tour in which I had introduced


“How Many Times,” “When the Red Red Robin
Comes Bob Bob Bobbin' Along” and “Ain't She Sweet,”
when two of Texas' backers heard me rehearsing at Irving
Berlin's offices. They were putting up the money to bring
her famous nightclub review, “Texas Guinan's Padlocks of
1927,” to Broadway. They asked me to audition for her.


I was sixteen and shy--I thought I knew all the answers
(after all, I <i>had</i> been in “Artists and Models”)--but I was
still a little girl who played “Spin the Bottle” at parties
and kept company with Leo Fox when his parents allowed
him to go out with a wicked actress like myself. La Guinan,
raucous and uninhibited, was something special for me.


Meeting Texas was like meeting a hurricane head on.
I walked into Shubert's 44th Street Theatre and the first
sight I saw was a well-proportioned five-foot six blonde
on the stage, with blue mascared eyelashes, scarlet
cupid's-bow lips, and beads hanging from her neck to

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I'm Lillian Roth,” I said meekly.


She looked me over. “Well, kid,” she rasped, in a voice
like a man's, “I hear you're pretty good. Let's hear you
sing.”


Halfway through my number she interrupted me.
“Where's the life in you, kid? They told me you're a
dynamo. What's doing?” Then, to no one in particular,
“I thought this kid was a bombshell.” And to me, again,
“If that's all you're going to do on the stage, it stinks!”


My face burned, but I became Jeanne Eagels. “I'm
sorry, Miss Guinan,” I said icily. “I have just finished my
B. F. Keith Circuit and I can go right back to it. In addition,
you sent for me, I didn't send for you.” I began to
stalk off the stage.


Texas relented. “Come back, kid,” she said, “don't get
excited.” She put her arm around me. “Just live up to
your notices, and we'll be friends.”


Never my best at rehearsals--even today I must have
an audience--I became more and more jittery. The night
before dress rehearsal, I got laryngitis: I was left with
a croak. Texas shifted her gum from her left to her right
cheek. “I just knew something like this would happen.”
Then to me, “Well, kid, I sure hope that by tomorrow
night it comes back, because it looks like the finish if you
don't make it by then.”


I went home in tears. “I'm not ready for it,” I cried.
“I'll be awful.” Even Katie became doubtful. But Dad
took control. He hurried to the medicine cabinet and returned
with an armful of sprays, syrups and lozenges.

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Look, baby,” he said, “stop putting fears into yourself.
You're going to be the best thing in that show and I'm
telling you--your voice is coming back!”


He dosed me with medicines, sprayed my throat,
poured hot tea into me, and packed me into bed under a
mountain of blankets. I sweated through the night. Whatever
the case--Dad's first aid, Marie Stoddard's Christian
Science, or an inner compulsion to please Katie--my voice
came back, strong and clear.


Since I appeared only in the first act, Katie and I went
home early to wait for the morning newspapers. Friends
dropped in to keep vigil. Katie bustled about nervously,
serving ice cream and cake, and I sat biting my fingernails.
The telephone rang. It was Milton Berle.


“Golly,” he said, and there was awe in his voice. “Lillian,
you ran away with the show! Wait until you see the
<i>American</i>. Let me read it to you!”


The critic of the New York <i>American</i> had written:
“This little girl comes through the curtains shortly after
nine o'clock to smash across three songs in the outstanding
performance of the show... She does a number of
things marvellously well, and she has more personality
to the square inch than any musical comedy actress seen
by this reviewer this season.”


Milton and his mother hurried over. We celebrated
until dawn, every newcomer bursting in waving a copy
of the <i>American</i>. Dad all but strutted. “Well, I told you,
Katie!” And my mother: “Oh, Arthur, you really know
my Lilly. O. K., you take the bows!”


The road up became glamorous. Winnie Lightner, by
all odds the top song comedienne of the day, was expected

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Oh, gosh, Mr. Fay, would I?” I had my doubts, and
they increased when I watched her perform that night
in all her magnificently hoydenish style. I can never be
that great, I thought. It was a long way from doing a
specialty with Texas Guinan, and filling the shoes of the
great Winnie Lightner. But I took home her lyrics and
studied them that night.


I was in the audience the following afternoon just before
the curtain rose. There was a tap on my shoulder.
It was an usher.


“You're wanted backstage, Miss Roth.”


Winnie was sick. I had to go on immediately.


A few minutes later I was singing her song, “I Love a
Man in a Uniform.” I floated off the stage on waves of
applause. Her smash hit had become one for me, too.


The “Revels” grand finale thrilled me as nothing before.
Whereas the finale of “Artists and Models” seemed
inane to me, with its nudes and waving hands, this was
pure theatre. Frank Fay stood on stage at the left, and
announced the cast as they paraded, one by one, down
a long center staircase.


First came the chorus girls, then the smaller principals,
then the principals, and then the stars, Patsy Kelly and
Bert Lahr. Then Frank's voice boomed out: “And now--
Miss--Lillian--Roth!” I appeared, to a fanfare of trumpets,
and descended the steps to the tune of “I Love a Man

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was only a step from “Revels” to Earl Carroll's
“Vanities of 1928.” At 17 I was signed, at $400 a week.
The new show had a fabulous cast. Sidney Skolsky was
press agent, Herman Hover, later manager of Ciro's in
Hollywood, was stage manager, and Busby Berkeley, choreographer.


The afternoon of the opening I came to rehearsal and
found the marquée blazing with names. There they were:
W. C. Fields; Ray Dooley; Joe Frisco; Dorothy Knapp,
the most beautiful girl in the world; Barto and Mann;
Vincent Lopez and his band. But the name of Lillian
Roth was nowhere to be seen. I read the marquée twice,
to make sure. Then I walked into the theatre and stalked
across the stage to where Earl Carroll stood talking to
others in the cast.


“Mr. Carroll,” I said in a trembling voice, “I see the
lights are going up. I'm one of the principals. You have
every one on that marquée outside but me and the man
who sweeps the stage.”


Mr. Carroll focused his pale blue eyes on me.


“Who do you think you are?” he asked softly.


I told him. “I'm Lillian Roth, Broadway's youngest
star. I was ‘The Roth Kids.’ I was a star on B. F. Keith's
Circuit. I replaced Winnie Lightner in the ‘Revels.’ I

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a shocked silence. Mr. Carroll looked at me
thoughtfully, as if seeing me for the first time. I met his
eye defiantly. He stood there, a tall, thin, baldish man
with long whispy hair, a worn gray artist's smock over
his frail body. There were two things he could do. He
could take me over his knee and spank me, or he could
kick me out of the show.


Instead, he grabbed my arm and dragged me off the
stage, through the stage door and out into the alley into
50th street, crowded with people. “I'll show you how
many people know you,” he muttered. When I caught my
balance, he was buttonholing one passerby after another,
demanding, “Do you know Lillian Roth? Have you ever
heard of Lillian Roth?”


Some, taken aback by this startling apparition, halted
for a moment, then hurried on. “What are you talking
about?” one man exclaimed, shaking himself loose. Another
went along with what he thought was a gag. “No,
who is she?” But he didn't wait for an answer.


Mr. Carroll wheeled on me. “All right, young lady,
now you know. Remember this: the people who go to
see you in vaudeville don't pay seven-seventy, and the
people who pay seven-seventy to see my show don't know
you.


I was undismayed. “Well,” I retorted furiously, “if
you'd asked them if they knew Winnie Lightner the way
you asked them if they knew me, they wouldn't know
what you're talking about, either. I'm leaving. Goodbye!”

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was heartbroken. I cried all the way home, and when
I arrived there, Katie folded me in her arms. “You're
right,” she declared. “You've worked all your life. If you
don't fight for what's yours, who will?'


“Oh, Mom,” I wailed through my tears, “imagine, Earl
Carroll's ‘Vanities’!”


Reality came quickly in an ultimatum from the theatre.
If I wasn't back before the performance, injunctions
would be brought against me by both Mr. Carroll and
Actor's Equity. I'd never work a Broadway show again.


Mother and I tearfully talked it over. We were beaten.
My contract had no provision for featured billing.


But if I failed to make the marquée lights, I had the
“Vanities” to thank for Beryl Halley, “The Form Divine,”
one of Mr. Carroll's featured show-girls. She took me
under her wing. I weighed 135 pounds. Beryl, who was
my height, weighed only 118. The reason for the difference
wasn't hard to find.


Like all the principals, I had a maid. The maids did
little but straighten your makeup table and hook up a
few dresses. They were there for prestige, mainly. My
girl, though, had a special job. Every few hours she vanished
in the direction of the corner soda fountain and
returned with a hot fudge sundae or a banana split
buried in whipped cream.


One day while I was devouring one of these, Beryl
came into my room. She watched me silently for a minute,
until I came up for air. Then she spoke. “Lillian, you
disgust me.”


“Really,” I said complacently. “Why?”


“Look at me and look at you! I could slice you in half
and you'd still look better. Don't you ever want to be

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Oh,” I said, “I've known some fat stars. There's Sophie
Tucker and Belle Baker--they're doing all right.”


“But your face calls for something else. Don't you see
yourself playing the love interest in motion pictures some
day?”


“Me? I'm no beauty,” I replied, flicking a blob of
whipped cream off my nose. “They have people like you to
be beautiful. I just sing songs.”


Beryl sighed. “Oh, Lillian. Take a good look in the
mirror. You've got potentialities if you wouldn't stuff
yourself like a little pig.”


I looked in the mirror. There might be something in
what Beryl said. I went on a diet, under her guidance:
apples, oranges and lamb chops. In addition, Mr. Carroll
had installed a vibrating machine for the girls in a corner
of the rehearsal room, and I dutifully strapped myself
into that. I was in its grip one night, shaking vigorously,
when Mr. Carroll strolled in. “Well,” he said, “you're
really taking care of yourself.” He walked up to me, lifted
my face to his, and kissed me, a far-from-ethereal kiss,
while the vibrater vibrated me and him along with it,
giving me the oddest sensation. “You're such a little girl,”
he said, his words trembling with everything else. “This
kiss is a little present from me.” And he went on to his
office.


As I unhooked myself from the machine, I thought:
this is the first time Earl Carroll has given me more than
casual notice since the day I walked out on him. I began
to understand. Perhaps it wasn't the talent you had, or
the personality--it was the form divine.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After all, I had slimmed down from 135 to 116.


Perhaps it <i>was</i> the form divine. A few days later the
William Fox Picture Company asked me to make a screen
test. “What did I tell you?” demanded Beryl, triumphantly.
“You were just hiding your potentialities.”


As we viewed the test later, the director said, “My
dear, if I were you, I'd forget all about a picture career.”


My heart sank. “Why?”


“Don't you notice anything about your smile? Your
smile is crooked. In pictures,” he said, in the voice of a
man stating a law of nature, “in pictures one must have
perfection. Nothing less will do.” I could not know that
a year and a half later I was to be engaged by Paramount
because--among other reasons--my smile, being crooked,
was full of personality.


I was so discouraged I went home and ate a chocolate
eclair.

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER V


I HAVE a vivid memory of my first drink. I had just
turned seventeen. A few minutes before midnight, 1928,
I stood excitedly in my new formal at the “Vanities”
stage-door. Inside, the cast were wishing one another a
riotously Happy New Year. (Only an hour before the
performance W. C. Fields almost broke us all up by
grabbing a broom and chasing a process-server up and
down the empty aisles, yowling at the top of his voice.)
I was waiting for Leo Fox to pick me up: Katie had given
me permission to stay out late that night for a New Year's
Eve party with our classmates from Clark, and to greet
1929 with a class breakfast.


There was Leo, jaunty in a new tuxedo, holding open
a cab door. “Come on, Lil. We're late.”


“Gosh, you look slick, Leo,” I said admiringly, and I
thought how lucky I was, because all the girls admired
him, but he had eyes only for me. On the way over in the
cab, Leo pulled out a flask. “Lil, I've got something here.
We've got to catch up with the other kids.”


Leo and I had never drunk anything but ice-cream
sodas together. But this was an occasion. He put the
flask to my lips. “Have a nip.” I took my first drink. It
burned my throat, and I felt the blood rush to my face.

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Gee, Leo, that's great. What is it?”


“Fermented prune juice,” he said. It was his own prohibition
home-brew, he added proudly. I thought, it's
probably good for my complexion. Sure speeds up the
circulation. I felt warm all over. As we stopped before
the hotel, I said, “I think I'll have another one of those
just before we get in, Leo.”


When we reached our table, someone said, “Have a
drink.” I drank. This was much stronger. I coughed and
sputtered, but again I felt wonderful. Suddenly the sirens
sounded, the bells rang, the horns tooted: it was midnight.
People hugged and kissed each other. Gaily colored
streamers shot through the air, the orchestra became
alive, and the lights went out.


I loved everybody. My shyness vanished. The clock in
my head slowed down. “Oh, this is glorious,” I thought.
“I'm walking on air. I'm going to hug every person in this
room and disappear. I'll vanish. Leo will have to search
for me.” I began to weave my way through the enormous
ballroom, amid the flying streamers, the voices shouting
“Happy New Year,” the music rippling and throbbing
and cascading all about me. At each table it seemed my
arm was grabbed. “Come on, little girl, down the hatch!”
I drank with everybody and I drank everything they gave
me. I glowed; an indescribable sense of freedom, a desire
to open my heart and enfold the whole shining rapturous
world overwhelmed me.


The room began to spin. Then I was sitting in the
dimly lit lobby, violently sick over my beautiful dress,
over Leo's new tuxedo. The music was far away, in the
ballroom two flights above, and a bellboy was trying to
help Leo clean me up. I was utterly ashamed.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“We'd better go home,” Leo was saying.


“What time is it?” I asked dazedly.


It was 12:50. In fifty minutes I had gone through an
entire gamut of emotions, and passed out. My experience
wasn't unusual, I know now. Other girls my age, drinking
as much as I had for the first time, would have reacted
much the same. There wasn't the slightest hint, that New
Year's Eve, that between alcohol and me there would
soon develop a bond so overpowering that until almost
the very end I believed only death could break it.


Leo managed to get me into a cab. Minutes later we
rang our doorbell. “Home so soon, baby?” my mother's
voice came sleepily. “Oh, Mom, go back to bed,” I said.
“I had a little accident. I'm going to change my dress and
we're going right out again.” I said it gaily. I was confident
that however sick I was, all I needed was will
power to conquer it.


I sat on the daybed for a moment, Leo beside me, holding
me up. Then it was daylight, and Katie was shaking
me. We had fallen asleep, fully-dressed, half stretched
out, half-propped up against the wall, shoulder to
shoulder. My mother gave Leo coffee and sent him home.


“Oh, Mom,” I said. “I sure don't know why Dad likes
to drink. It's awful! I feel terrible--if for those few minutes
of fun I could get this sick--I'll never touch that
stuff again.”


Katie laughingly bathed and rubbed me down, then
sent me off to bed.


My father wasn't there to give his expert advice. He
and Katie had separated--permanently.


Florenz Ziegfeld sent for me, just as “Vanities” was

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Not once did Ziegfeld look up. He sat there, thumbing
through papers, doddling, and rearranging his elephants.
I thought, bravely, if you can sing to J. J. Shubert's back,
you can sing to the top of Mr. Ziegfeld's head. My song
over, I bowed a “Good afternoon, Mr. Ziegfeld,” and began
to leave.


He looked up then. “When is the show closing?”


“Next week,” I said automatically.


“Then we start rehearsing next week--my new Ziegfeld's
‘Midnight Frolics.’ You'll be the ingenue lead.”


I was engaged, at $500 a week.


There was no question that Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam
Theatre Roof was the smartest nightclub in New York.
After they finished “glorifying” the Follies in the theatre
downstairs, Ziegfeld's gorgeous show girls trouped upstairs
to appear in the Frolics. It was a glittering show.
Ted Husing was master of ceremonies, and Paul White-man
conducted the orchestra, opening with “Rhapsody in
Blue,” with Henry Busse at the trumpet. Ziegfeld's girls
paraded to “A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody” after which
Ted brought me on for a song and dance. In the cast
were Helen Morgan, the Duncan Sisters, and the Rhythm
Boys--Al Rinker, Harry Barris and Bing Crosby.


As Lenore Ulric had once been, now Helen Morgan
became my idol. Her exquisite beauty, her charm even
when she had been drinking, worked their magic over

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One of my worst nights was when Ziegfeld let Rinker,
Barris and Crosby go. I had a quiet crush on Bing. I
loved his casual singing style, the way he clashed a
cymbal as though clashing one was the last thing he
wanted to do. Ziegfeld, just back from a European tour,
apparently decided the cymbal didn't fit in with the lofty
tone of his show. The Rhythm Boys had to go.


Offstage, Bing was mild-mannered and quiet, a rather
lonely person who seemed to need mothering. When he
crooned in the style that later made him famous, shivers
ran up and down my spine.


Often, after the show, knowing Katie's fear of the
night, Bing walked us through the lonely streets to a
well-lighted section near where we lived, bade us a gallant
goodnight, and sauntered off. Katie had a way with
lonely people; they liked her, and she was comforting to
them. After the trio was let out, I asked Bing what he
thought he might do next.


“I don't know, honey,” he said. Then, thoughtfully,
“We might go out and take a look around Hollywood.”

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER VI


WHEN my big break came, it came suddenly. Al
Jolson's “The Jazz Singer” burst upon the world and
launched the “Talkies.” It sounded the doom of vaudeville;
and it also posed the question: how many ways
could the human voice be used on the screen?


Shortly after I opened in the Frolics, Jesse Lasky of
Paramount tested me for something new in films--one
and two reel singing shorts. I went before the camera and
sang some of my popular songs directly to the audience,
trying to achieve a rapport with them until they actually
sang in their seats.


The test was successful. “Why these short subjects
then?” I asked Mr. Lasky. “Why can't I get into a big
picture?”


“It doesn't work that way, my dear,” he explained. “A
director must see you and send for you. They must want
you for a part out there.” He added kindly, “But I'll keep
an eye open and if anything happens, I'll let you know.”


A few weeks later I hurried down to the Criterion
Theatre to see the premiere of my first short, in which I
sang, “Ain't She Sweet!” On the same bill was Maurice
Chevalier's first American picture, “Innocents of Paris,”
and I was eager to see that, especially since Mr. Chevalier

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My hopes were dashed a moment after my short
flashed on. Was this how I appeared on the screen? How
could I ever dream of being another Garbo or Barry-more?
I wrinkled my nose, I screwed up my face, I
blinked, my smile was definitely crooked...


Then Chevalier's picture. I was entranced. His charm
and gaiety filled the theatre. That night I stood in the
wings at the Frolics and saw the great French star sing
“Valentina,” wearing his famous straw hat, grinning his
captivating and oh-so-crooked smile, letting the magic
of his warm personality work its wonder on us. The
audience cheered itself hoarse.


Yes, I thought, as I returned to my dressing room, you
always know when you're in the presence of a great
Either you had it, or you didn't--


“Miss Roth--”


It was a stagehand. Mr. Jesse Lasky and Mr. Ernest
Lubitsch were in the house and would like the pleasure
of my company at intermission.


Mr. Lasky introduced me to a little man with a big
cigar, who seemed to whistle under his breath as he rose.
“Mr. Lubitsch,” said Mr. Lasky with a twinkle in his eye,
“is interested in you, Lillian. He saw your short film this
evening and he's been watching you perform here. He'd
like to talk to you.”


Almost breathless, I sank into a chair. This was Europe's
greatest director. To be given the “Lubitsch touch”
meant stardom. Mr. Lubitsch looked at me. Then he removed
his cigar and said in a thick German accent: “How
would you like to go to Hollywood?”

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I found my tongue. “I'd love to!” For a moment I
thought melodramatically--it means leaving Leo, but I
must choose quickly between love and a career.


Lubitsch pulled reflectively at his cigar. “I am making
Mr. Chevalier's picture, ‘The Love Parade.’ I think you
would be good in it.”


Me, play opposite Chevalier? “Oh, Mr. Lubitsch!” I
gasped.


On the ground that my Hollywood experience would
enhance my value later, Earl Carroll gave up an option
he had on my services. Paramount signed me to a seven-year
contract: $600 a week for the first six months, $750
for the next six, then $1,000 a week, then $1,500, then
$2,000 and, in three years, $3,200 a week!


Chevalier was on the same Super-Chief that took
Mother and me to the West Coast, but I worshipped him
from afar. I dared not approach him. I only dreamed of
the great love scenes he and I would play under Lubitsch's
magic direction. My heart was breaking a little
for Leo--and when I was not wandering through the
train hoping to catch a glimpse of Chevalier, I was writing
tearful letters to Leo.


The publicity drums began booming. I posed for photographs
in net stockings and the highest of heels, and with
a garter peeping out from the ruffles. This was the same
star buildup the studio had given Clara Bow and Nancy
Carroll before me.


Mr. Lubitsch greeted me with a smile when I arrived
on the set. There, before my awestruck gaze, was Maurice
Chevalier, the beautiful Jeanette MacDonald, and
a little man with expressive, merry eyes, Lupino Lane,

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mr. Lubitsch introduced me. “Do you remember me?”
I ventured to ask Chevalier. “I worked with you in the
Frolics.”


He flashed his inimitable smile. “Of course--I remember--how
could I forget?”


Lubitsch passed out copies of the script. “Now, will
you please sit there, Mr. Chevalier--” He pointed to a
bench. “And Miss MacDonald--” He stopped. Script in
hand, I was floating ecstatically toward Chevalier's
bench.


“No, Miss Roth. I want you to sit on the other bench
with Mr. Lane. You're playing opposite him.”


I was crestfallen. How naive could I have been? Who
else but lovely Jeanette MacDonald would play opposite
Chevalier? And I--and Mr. Lane--what were we to do?


I soon found out.


“We have two identical sets here,” Lubitsch explained.
“Mr. Chevalier and Miss MacDonald will sit on that
bench. You, Miss Roth, will sit with Mr. Lane on this
bench. He is Mr. Chevalier's butler. You are playing the
maid to Miss MacDonald's princess. They are having a
love affair; you and Mr. Lane are having one, too. You
two are to parody everything your master and mistress
do. When they kiss, you kiss. When Mr. Chevalier declares
his love for Miss MacDonald, Mr. Lane will declare
his love for you. Get it?”


I got it. As Chevalier pursued Jeanette, at a high point
in the scene, Lupino was to pursue me, bringing his face
so close to mine that I was to gaze cross-eyed with love
at him.


I had to hold back my tears as Lubitsch sketched the

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Lubitsch chewed savagely at his cigar. He began to
whistle under his breath. “That's terrible, Lillian! Where's
all that zip and zoom you had on the Ziegfeld roof?”


“Oh, Mr. Lubitsch,” I wailed. “I'm so disappointed! I
thought I was going to play the love interest opposite Mr.
Chevalier. I'm not a comedienne!”


He put his cigar back into his mouth grimly. “When I
am finished with you young lady, you will be. Get off
that bench.” I obeyed. He sat down next to Lupino Lane.
“Now, Lillian, watch!” He clasped his arms passionately
around Lupino, and cigar in mouth, looked at him with
such soulful cross-eyes that the entire company roared.


“That's the way to do it!” he growled. “Come here a
minute.” I walked up to him. “Let's see you cross your
eyes.” I tried, unsuccessfully. He put his forefinger a few
inches in front of my nose. “Watch it,” he ordered. “Don't
take your eyes off it.” Slowly he brought his finger nearer
and nearer the bridge of my nose, until it was an inch
away. I felt my eyes move inward: I stared, cross-eyed.


“Perfect, little lady!” he said, and chucked me under
the chin. “Now sit down and make love!”


Chevalier was extremely kind to me during those
delirious, free-wheeling early days. Sometime later I went
to San Francisco for a film premiere. Gary Cooper, then
even more silent and taciturn than he is today, was my
escort.


At dinner after the show I found myself seated between
Chevalier and Cooper. J sat stiffly between the

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For an ecstatic three minutes I was in his arms. I cudgelled
my brain for scintillating conversation, but nothing
came. The best I could manage was, “Wasn't the audience
enthusiastic tonight?”


He nodded: “And you are enthusiastic, too?”


“Oh, yes,” I sighed. “I get pleasure out of everything.”
We danced in silence for a moment. “You have very
beautiful eyes, Miss Roth,” he said, and his smile made
my heart pound. “You must be careful that they do not
get you into trouble.”


That was my romance with Maurice Chevalier.


Shortly after I signed at Paramount a German actress
arrived--Marlene Dietrich. She was lonely and unhappy.
We shared the same make-up girl--Dot Pondell--who
years later became Judy Garland's confidante. It was Dot
who was always after me to take off weight, just as
M-G-M nagged at Judy for her plumpness. I gained
weight as we shot “The Love Parade” and Lubitsch ordered
me to take off ten pounds. I wasn't too successful;
and since he shot the story backward, I was heavier at
the beginning of the picture than at the end. I tried every
method to lose weight, even gathering courage one day to
accost one of Paramount's top stars who seemed to be
able to melt pounds away at will.

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“How do you do it?” I asked. “What's your secret?”


“No secret at all, Lillian,” she said. “Just take a glass
of half-and-half--half gin, half lemon juice--every morning
for breakfast.” Her method was far too drastic for me
then. (Years later I tried the plan, improving on it by
eliminating the lemon juice, but then the idea had nothing
to do with diet.)


One morning Dot said, “Why don't you drop in on
Marlene? She'd appreciate a visitor.” I went to her dressing
room, and whether because of my youth or my obvious
hero worship, she confided in me. She was unhappy
in Hollywood, she said, lost in the swift, impersonal rush
of America, and heartsick for her little daughter, whom
she had left in Germany. I adored Dietrich, her charm,
her deep voice, her warmth. As we chatted, I surreptitiously
glanced at her legs again and again, for she was
to be my competition: according to Paramount publicity,
I had the most beautiful legs in Hollywood. This was not
actually true: Lubitsch nurtured the legend by ordering
me to wear shoes and hose of the same color, and coaching
me how to walk and place my legs when I stood or
sat. Dietrich never worried about such details--no matter
how she walked or sat or stood, her legs were beautiful.


I was not too happy myself in Hollywood. My social
life was dull. Letters to Leo every few days; now and
then one to Ann, who was attending boarding school, and
to Dad, who was living in Boston; the movies with my
mother, when I wasn't too tired; a visit or two with Mr.
Lasky, who had moved to the West Coast offices of Paramount.
My hours were long. Sometimes I began work at
6 a.m., when I had to be on set for makeup, and returned
home after midnight. I went out a few times with Junior

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

until David came along.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER VII


I HAD only a waving acquaintance with David Lyons at
Clark. I was fourteen, then, and he was nineteen. But he
was to become important to me during those first few
months in Hollywood.


Junior Laemmle phoned me one night and asked me
to go for a drive. On the way he said, “I forgot to tell
you--you know, we've got a school friend living over in
North Hollywood. He's been under the weather lately,
but I know he'd like us to stop in and say hello.”


David sat up in bed when we walked into his room.
His curly blue-black hair was tousled, and he was pale,
but he flashed a cheerful, contagious grin that had me
smiling back without realizing it. “Hiya, Lums!”


“What a funny name,” I said. “Nobody ever called me
Lums.”


“That's short for Lillums,” he said. “And Lums sort of
fits you, too.”


“My name's Lillian,” I said a little tartly. “My mother
always said everybody must call me by my full name,
Lillian. Not Lilly. And not Lums.”


His smile lit up the room. “Well, I'm sorry, but you're
Lums to me. Now, if you'll just skidaddle out of here and
wait a minute, I'll get some clothes on and we'll talk
about school days.”

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When he came into the living room a few minutes later
and draped his slim, five-foot-ten over the arm of my
chair, I began thinking that perhaps Leo wasn't the only
boy in the world. David was brimful of personality, and
exuded charm and good spirits--an exuberance you could
not withstand. He was working for Junior as an assistant
director, having recently come from a six-month stay in
Arizona.


We talked about Leo, whom he knew and liked, and
about Clark.


“You used to be standoffish, if I remember,” I said.
“You drove a big yellow Packard--”


“And I wore a raccoon coat--”


“That's right,” I said, suddenly remembering the dashing
appearance he made, and how I had been too shy to
try to know him better because he was so much older.
“And you were going to study law.”


He nodded. “I went to Syracuse University. But now
I'm out here--and at this particular moment,” he said,
looking at me meaningfully, “I don't mind telling you I
wouldn't change for anything.”


I must have raised my eyebrows at that, for he hastened
to add, “Look, Lums, don't get me wrong. I feel
toward you like I would toward a sister. I know you go
with Leo, but suppose you were my sister. You'd let me
take you to a movie, wouldn't you?”


I nodded.


“Well, believe me, that's the way I feel about you. And
I'd like to take you out tomorrow night. May I?”


He might get off his high horse and feel about me as
a boy feels about a girl, I thought, a little annoyed. But
I welcomed his friendship. I was in glamorous Hollywood,

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few nights later David took me to the opening of
Junior's first picture, which starred Alberta Vaughan.
“Now, you'll be brought to the mike and asked to say a
few words about Junior,” David warned me. “After all,
you're going to appear in ‘The Love Parade’ and you're
a personality.”


I planned to say how glad I was to be there. Instead,
I began talking about Junior's activities at school, and
went on until David all but pulled me away. I had made
a fool of myself.


David sought to console me during the ride home. “I
feel about you as I do about my sister,” he said, “and if
she were sad, I would do this.” He pressed a cool kiss on
my forehead. That irked me. The more often he called
me his sister, the more annoyed I became--and the easier
it was to forget Leo.


My letters to Leo became fewer: his answers to me,
more infrequent. Soon David and I were meeting wherever
possible. It wasn't always easy, because Hollywood's
infamous caste system kept us apart. The studio insisted
that I was a star, and ought not be seen too often with
David, for he was only an assistant director. Thus, he
was never invited to the studio parties to which I was
asked, although those who extended the invitations knew
we were going together. David took it in good spirit. He
always waited outside until the party was over, and then
we had a little time to ourselves. The nightlife we knew
consisted of a brief visit to BBB's, a nightspot off Hollywood
Boulevard, where we sipped soft drinks, or a dance
at the Roosevelt Hotel.


“I don't feel at all about you as I do about my sister,”

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I reassured him. “That's over now. You're not taking
me from Leo. My romance with him was puppy love,
David. I know it now. It's the real thing with you.”


“'Lums, darling,” he would say. “If you only knew how
much I love you and how happy I want to make you!”
He would kiss me then, and I would forget everything
else. Only with David, it seemed, could I be myself. He
loved me as I was. I needed no pretense, felt no need to
justify myself to him. He alone spoke about making me
happy; everyone else spoke about making me famous.


We began to talk about marriage. I would leave the
profession when I was twenty-one; I would work hard,
meanwhile, and save my money, and he would work hard,
and save his money, and then we would be married.


As the weeks passed, Katie grew more and more concerned.
She upbraided me. David wasn't the right boy,
she said. Anyone who would allow me to give up my
career couldn't really have my interests at heart. In any
case, at eighteen what right had I to contemplate marriage?
I was only at the beginning of a career that could
take me to unknown heights. “Oh,” she cried, “when I
think of the youth and beauty and talent you're ready to
throw away for that boy--.” She grew hysterical. “I can't
bear to see it,” she wept. “If he must be with you all the
time, take another apartment. I just can't bear to see him
around you all the time!”


I was torn. Everything Katie had built up for me, all
the dreams she had had for me even before I was born,
were crashing before her eyes. And she <i>was</i> right: I was
too young to think of marriage. But to turn away from

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In desperation, I moved into another apartment in the
same building, but two weeks later Katie and I were
friends again, and I had moved back. We lived in a
state of undeclared truce. Katie's apprehension, in part,
stemmed from a fact more evident to her than to me:
how seriously ill David was. I did not realize it until one
afternoon when he suffered a violent coughing spell and
spat up blood. The doctor, after examining him, took me
aside.


“Don't you know?” he said. “This young man is tubercular.
He'll have to remain in bed for a while.”


I was shocked. David <i>was</i> sick. And because he was,
and needed me, I loved him the more.


The following night I had a social engagement with
Paul Bern, the M-G-M producer whose suicide, a few
years after his tragic marriage to Jean Harlow, so stunned
the film world. I could not break the appointment: it was
an unwritten law in Hollywood that you didn't break
appointments with producers. Mr. Bern took me to the
theatre. As we sat there, my mind was with David. Desperately
I wanted to be at his bedside taking care of him.
The old impatience came upon me. Suddenly I felt a
horrifying sensation as if ants were crawling over my
skin! I squirmed, almost beside myself. (Not until later
was I to learn what bizarre forms anxiety could take.) And
what would Mr. Bern think of me? He pretended to notice
nothing, and finally the seizure passed.


Later, driving me home, he said, “I'm going to tell you

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I should have remembered his advice.


David and I were now all but inseparable. Late one
afternoon I started a particularly tough dubbing chore.
I must have sung one song twenty times. By nine o'clock
the scene still didn't suit the director. David had been
waiting for me since six. I committed the most grievous
sin of all in the eyes of a studio executive. I pretended I
heard the director say I could go home, and I walked off
the set.


That night David and I went away, across the border
to Tijuana. Perhaps I would break the promise I'd made
to Katie that I wouldn't consider marriage before I was
21: I wasn't sure. We stayed away that night. But we did
not consummate our love. I knew little about sex, and
what I knew confused and frightened me. My memories
were tied up with lecherous old men and back-stage obscenities.
And David, no more experienced than I, was
ill, racked with coughing spells, and I mothered him
through the long hours to dawn.


We had it all planned: one day we'd have three children,
two boys and a girl, and they would have the home
and garden, the parents in love with each other, and the
sense of belonging I never had.


David knew I knew he was sick, and worried about
him. But when, for weeks on end, he was so full of energy

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly, Jesse Lasky waved his magic wand again.


He called me into his office one morning.


“I've just had a letter from your father,” he said. “He
certainly writes extravagantly about you. But there may
be something in what he says.”


Arthur, he went on, insisted that I was a great dramatic
actress who had never had a chance to show my talent.
Well, continued Mr. Lasky, Paramount had tested nearly
150 girls for the role of Huguette, in “The Vagabond
King,” the studio's major production. He explained that
Huguette was a woman of the streets, about 32, and the
sweetheart of the poet Francois Villon, to be played by
Dennis King. Some of the top stars in Hollywood coveted
the role.


“Now,” he said, “maybe your father knows what he's
talking about, even if you are only 18. I want you to go
across the lot to Ludwig Berger, who's directing the picture.
Tell him I want you tested for Huguette.”


Dressed as I was, in sweater, pleated knee-length skirt,
tam o'shanter, golf shoes and socks, I hurried to find Mr.
Berger.


“Mr. Lasky told me to see you,” I told him breathlessly.


He glanced at me impatiently. “For what reason?”


“To test me for Huguette.”


“What!” he exclaimed. “My God, I ask for another Pola
Negri and they send me a Louise Fazenda!” He stared
at me. “Not only that--but look at you. You look fourteen
years old. You're a little girl. This calls for a woman with
fire!”

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I stepped forward, stung to the quick. “I can be very
fiery, Mr. Berger,” I said acidly. “Why don't you test me
and see?”


Mr. Berger all but tore his hair, what there was of it.
“I don't know what's going to happen in Hollywood
next,” he groaned. “Go to the wardrobe department and
get fitted and be here tomorrow night at nine o'clock.”


I woke next morning with a fever of 101 and a voice
that was more like a croak. The chance of my life awaited
me, and I had grippe! Was the Texas Guinan jinx at work
here, too? If only Dad were on hand to help me!


Shortly before nine o'clock, a raging fever banging at
the base of my skull, I appeared on the lot. I waited. Ten
o'clock. Eleven o'clock. At midnight I found a blanket in
a corner and crawled under it, shivering with chills, alternately
dozing and waking. At two a.m. Mr. Berger
shouted, “Miss Roth!”


I staggered over to him. “All right, this is your scene.”
A hand stuck a script in my face. “This is a death scene,”
said Mr. Berger. “Let's see you die.”


That was exactly what I wanted to do. Dennis King's
stand-in took me in his arms, I recited my lines in a sepulchral


voice, closed my eyes slowly, and died.


“<i>Wunderbar!</i>” Mr. Berger threw his arms around me
and kissed me. The role of Huguette was mine. I was the
new dramatic find of the year. Next day Jesse Lasky exulted
over the telephone, as delighted as if he'd been my
uncle. “Lillian, the rushes were wonderful. You've got the
role of the year--the plum part in the first all-musical
technicolor!”


I was ecstatic. I had found myself at last! Tragedy was

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

David, now working as night director at Universal,
shared my delight. His hours were from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
So that I could spend more time with him, I bought
my first car, a Chrysler 77; and toward midnight every
night I drove the fifteen miles to his studios in North
Hollywood. We got very little sleep, but we were rapturously
in love, and all was well no matter how much
others might disapprove.


Each morning I came bouncing to rehearsal. In my
little skirts and blouses and flat shoes, I must have looked
ridiculous going through my part. Time and again I
caught Dennis King and his co-star, Jeanette MacDonald,
exchanging smiles as they watched me.


Also observing me with some interest was a famous
British actor who was completing a Robin Hood production
on an adjoining lot. Tall, handsome, debonair, Robin
Hood, too, doubted my qualifications. He asked me to
lunch. “I've been talking to many of your Hollywood
stars,” he began, “and they agree that it's quite odd to
have an 18-year-old girl play Huguette.”


“Why?” I asked. He smiled down at me. “My dear, how
would an innocent like you, with no experience in love,
portray the fire and passion that is Huguette?”


“Why, that's absurd,” I retorted. “I'm very much in
love, as it happens, and I have plenty of warmth.”


He looked at me pityingly. “No, Lillian, you need a
good love affair. And I could teach you the art of love-then,
I assure you, you'd be the personification, the epitome,

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I giggled.


A few days later he approached Katie on the lot, and
in a gallant manner that quite enchanted her, said, “Mrs.
Roth, I'd deem it a privilege if I could take your daughter
to dinner one evening.”


Mother urged me to go. “You've been working hard.
He'll take you to some lovely spots. And it'll do you good
to go out at least one night with someone other than
David.”


Perhaps because I was 18, and curious to see what
would happen, I agreed. I could take care of myself.
Hadn't Albert, at Clark, learned that the hard way? I
was 14, he was 16, and I had told him he must be smoking
secretly because I smelled tobacco on his breath. “Is
that so?” he demanded. He pushed his face teasingly next
to mine, and unexpectedly kissed me on the mouth. I
slapped him with a roundhouse right that I brought up
almost from the floor. It swung him halfway around. He
kept his distance after that. Of course I could take care
of myself.


On the appointed evening Robin Hood, and his secretary,
Sidney, called for me and we drove to Venice
Beach, an amusement park. “We'll have a bit of fun here,”
he said enthusiastically. Pretty harmless fellow at that,
I thought.


He escorted me into the front seat of a roller coaster.
As it swept into its first dip, he grabbed the safety bar
in panic. “Ye Gods!” he squealed. “This is the end! We'll
never get out of this thing alive!” As we roared on, he
forgot all about me. His face was frozen: he put his head
between his knees, and moaned. This was the swash-buckling

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Never again,” he breathed fervently when we jerked
to a stop. Until 11 p.m. we enjoyed ourselves on milder
amusements, while Sidney trailed behind us, carrying the
ice-cream cones and popcorn, and souvenirs I won. Then
I suggested it was time to go home.


“Righto!” said Robin Hood. We drove toward home.
“What say we stop at my apartment for a moment--
there's no use having Sidney come all the way into town,”
he said. “We'll drop him off there.”


Why not? Nothing dreadful was likely to happen with
Sidney there. When a woman housekeeper answered the
door, I felt doubly reassured.


Once inside, Sidney served us champagne. Robin Hood
sat at the piano and accompanied himself in a romantic
ballad while I sipped the champagne. It was the second
time I had ever had an intoxicating drink. The bubbles
tickled my nose delightfully, and I liked the vinegary
lemony flavor. “It tastes like citrate of magnesia,” I exclaimed.
“It won't feel like that, my dear,” said Robin
Hood, stopping long enough to refill my goblet.


Now the victrola was playing, and I was dancing and
singing happily. Suddenly Robin Hood's strong arms
were around me, he was dragging me into an adjoining
bedroom, trying to pull my clothes from me. I was dizzy,
but not helpless: I fought him off, tearing and scratching
and screaming.


“My God, you're a little hell-cat!” he exclaimed. “How
you excite me!” But I fought and bit and kicked, and

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As Sidney led me to the front door I managed to get
out a parting word: “I told you I had fire!” I screamed,
and burst into tears.


Sidney silently drove me home. Robin Hood's picture
was held up for three days until his face healed sufficiently
for makeup to hide his wounds.


When the time came for Huguette's death scene to be
put on film, my temperament and physical disability conspired
to help me. The heat that day was almost intolerable;
the city sweltered in a temperature of almost 103
degrees, and under the technicolor lights, the mercury
hit 110. We repeated the scene so often that I became
hysterical, and had to be given sedatives. As I rested in
the first-aid room, Mr. Bachman, the producer, rushed
in. “Lillian, you've got to go back for one more take.”


“No, I can't!” I couldn't control my sobs. “I just can't
do it again!”


They cajoled, they pleaded, they insisted, and finally,
they helped me back and the scene I played then was
that used in the film--when I returned to work before the
camera, exhausted from the heat, from weariness, from
hysteria.

CHAPTER VIII


THE NEWS I brought to David from the mail room
was startling: my fan mail was pouring in second only to
that of Clara Bow, the “It” girl, and Paramount's reigning
queen. And I hadn't even been starred in a picture!


“Darling,” David said jubilantly, “that's the way you're
really made in Hollywood. Not by the studio, but by the
public!”


Paramount promptly capitalized on my popularity by
casting me in “Honey.” The song I sang, “Sing, You
Sinners!” became a tremendous hit, and was identified
with me for years afterward. It's a favorite with audiences
even today.


In Paramount's next film, “Paramount on Parade,”
Buddy Rogers and I sang another hit: “Anytime's The
Time To Fall in Love.”


Now Cecil B. DeMille, looking for a siren for his new
extravaganza, “Mme Satan,” borrowed me from Paramount,
and I found myself reading my lines to the master
himself. DeMille then was a compact, balding man who
wore riding pants, shiny black boots, an open-collared
shirt, and was never seen without a riding crop. He was
brisk and impersonal.

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The plot of “Mme Satan” called for me to steal Reginald
Denny from Kay Johnson, who played his wife.
We were supposed to be attending a masquerade ball on
a zeppelin. At the height of the festivities, the zeppelin
cracks up and begins to sink. Kay Johnson, clinging to
her husband, begs frantically, “Oh, if we ever get out of
this alive, please, please, give my husband back to me.”


I retort, “On one condition. There are only two parachutes
left and three of us. I'll take a parachute and you
take your husband.”


DeMille liked my reading. “Fine,” he said. “Go to the
wardrobe department and tell Adrian I want him to take
your measurements.”


Hollywood's famed dress designer had prepared a
startling costume. I was to come to the ball as a pheasant
--iridescent golden bra, iridescent golden shorts, and
stemming out behind, tremendous pheasant feathers.
Adrian wrestled with the bra. “You'll never fit into it,”
he said, annoyed, looking at me as if I had betrayed him.
“I've designed it for a boyish figure.”


We consulted Mr. DeMille. “The girl isn't supposed to
be made to fit the bra,” he said sharply. “Make the bra
fit the girl.” Adrian scolded and fussed, but did as he was
told.


After DeMille obtained an interior shot of me in the
zeppelin, he said, “Tomorrow you're going to jump. The
zeppelin will be breaking up. You'll jump from there.”


I followed his pointing finger, and stared, open-mouthed.
More than 200 feet above our heads was a
narrow ledge. Far below it was a net. “Me, jump from
up there?” I gasped. “Into that net? In these high heels
and feathers? Oh, Mr. DeMille, I couldn't possibly!”

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He scarcely looked up from his notebook. “I'll see you
at nine o'clock in the morning, Lillian.”


I got to a telephone as fast as I could and rang up
Walter Wanger, in charge of Paramount production. “I
can't do it,” I protested. “I'm frightened. I'll break my
neck making a jump like that.”


Mr. Wanger was sympathetic. “Don't worry, Lillian,
you're too valuable a property. <b>I'll</b> ask Mr. DeMille to
get a double.”


Nine o'clock next morning, Mr. DeMille said, “All
right, Lillian, here's where you jump.”


I jumped, thinking of things to say to Paramount if I
survived. DeMille had a way of saying “jump”--and you
jumped. Not once, but five times before he was satisfied.


Almost as appalling was the scene that followed. I was
to rebound out of the net and crash through the glass
skylight of a men's Turkish bath. Perched on a narrow
ledge, where I was held by a stagehand so I wouldn't
tumble, I was to plunge through a large sheet of candy
glass, which photographed like the real thing, but supposedly
was far safer.


Again I protested. “Mr. DeMille, in ‘The Love Parade,’
Lupino Lane was so excited by one of my kisses that he
jumped right through candy glass and he was all cut up.
It might happen to me, too.”


DeMille said nothing. Instead, he strode over to a pane
of candy glass leaning against the wall, lifted it high over
his head like a platter, and brought it down hard on his
skull. The glass smashed and shattered all about him.
“If it didn't hurt my old bald head,” he said caustically,
walking away dripping splintered glass, “it won't hurt
your young back end.” I jumped on schedule.

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Suddenly, everything seemed to go awry. While making
a short with a rotund comic, the cameraman told me
my face couldn't be seen in a close-up kiss. “Ask him to
turn aside so that we see you for a moment,” the cameraman
instructed me. I followed orders, only to have the
actor suddenly mutter under his breath as he held me
close, “Who in hell wants to look at a little Jew like you?”


I walked off the set in tears. “I won't work with that
man,” I managed to say when I was called on the carpet.
And I wouldn't--or couldn't--tell why.


The front office issued an ultimatum. Go back and
finish the scene--or be suspended. I finished the scene.


I came home nights to argue violently with Mother. I
simply must stop seeing David, she cried. It was affecting
my work and my health. He had no real interest in me,
or in my career. She would rather break my contract with
Paramount, she wept, then see us married.


She was under great pressure because David's parents
had telephoned her several times from New York. They
were deeply concerned. The hours David and I kept,
trying to be together despite his night shift, were only
making him more ill, they insisted. But beyond this, they
made clear, they would never permit their son to marry
a girl in show business. This was unthinkable. If we
dared marry, they would annul it.


Everything was being done to break up our romance.
David and I clung together. “They'll come around,” he
would say, trying to comfort me. “You'll see. They'll all
come around in the end.”


But worse was on tap. A switch in the top echelons at
Paramount brought B. P. Shulberg to the Coast to replace
Jesse Lasky. I quickly discovered a new hand was at the

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“What do you mean?” I asked uncertainly.


Well, he went on as we danced, each of us smiling and
nodding to others, it appeared I had once deliberately
walked off the set; I had complained about Mr. DeMille;
I had caused a scene over an insult, real or fancied, in
a close-up shot; and I was temperamental and difficult.


“We're sending you back to New York to be kicked in
the rear by the Marx Brothers until you learn how to
behave,” he concluded casually.


I was stunned. I left him standing on the floor and ran
crying into another room. But his word was law. I was to
play a love interest in the Marx Brothers' new picture,
“Animal Crackers,” being shot in New York. What neither
my mother nor David's parents had been able to accomplish--separating
David and me--was done by a one-sentence
ultimatum from Paramount's front office.


Mr. Shulberg later salved my wounds. When I returned
from New York, a wonderful part would be awaiting me:
playing the romantic interest in the new Chevalier picture!


If anything made bearable my separation from David,
it was the zany experience of making a film with the
Marxes. It was one step removed from a circus. First
Zeppo, the youngest, sauntered into the studio, about
9:30. At 10 somebody remembered to telephone Chico
and wake him. Harpo, meanwhile, popped in, saw that
most of the cast was missing, and strolled off. Later they
found him asleep in his dressing room. Chico arrived

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Work resumed at mid-afternoon, and then it was five
o'clock, and they were finished for the day.


Every scene took longer than the director planned, for
the ad libs came thick and fast, and the budget soared as
the laughs increased.


Groucho and I had a scene that had to be shot over at
least ten times. In this instance I was the culprit. We
were supposed to be hunting a thief who had stolen a
valuable painting from Margaret Dumont, who played
the society dowager Groucho chased. My line, when we
stumbled on a fake painting, was, “Oh, if we could only
find the real painting!” Groucho's line was, “I know who
the thief is. Here's his signature.” “Who is it?” I asked.
“Rembrandt,” he said. “Don't be silly, he's dead,” I retorted.
Groucho snarled, “Then it's murder.” I burst into
giggles every time he said that, ruining the take. The line
itself wasn't so hilarious, but I knew Groucho was going
to say it with the big cigar jutting from his clenched
teeth, his eyebrows palpitating, and that he would be off
afterwards in that runaway crouch of his; and the
thought of what was coming was too much for me.


We were running far over schedule, and I was eager
to get back to David and the Chevalier picture. Word
came from the coast: the film was already under way!
Then, a reassuring report--Paramount was using a girl
who resembled me in some of the long shots. There had
been many newspaper stories reporting that I had won

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally Katie and I were on the train bound for the
coast. During the ten-minute stopover in Kansas City I
bought a newspaper and read: “UNKNOWN TO PLAY
CHEVALIER'S LEADING LADY.” They ran a picture
of the girl, Frances Dee. I died a thousand deaths between
Kansas City and Los Angeles.


The parting of the ways was inevitable. It came after I
made one more picture--“Sea Legs,” with Jack Oakie.
The final straw was my discovery that when Paramount
sent me out on personal appearance tours, they received
nearly five times as much for my services as they were
paying me.


Both Katie and David--separately--agreed that I
should go out on my own.


“Lums, you have box-office appeal,” David argued.
“You can sing and dance. Most Hollywood stars come
out on the stage, say, ‘How do you do?’, and take a bow.
They've had no stage training.”


David had so much faith in my potentialities that he
joined an agency office to book me. He offered me to the
Balaban and Katz Theatre Circuit in Chicago; they engaged
me at $1,750 a week, more than twice my Paramount
salary. And I was held over for seven weeks,
playing north, west and south Chicago, and the famous
Loop.


No question of it--we'd made the right decision.
Mounted police held back the crowds as I emerged from
the stage door between and after shows. Bids came pouring
in. David, delighted, flew to New York to handle
them.

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then, a long distance call from him: “Darling, you're
set to headline at the Palace in November! The Palace--
and top billing! And four Paramount short subjects in
Astoria, at $3,500 a short!”


I was overjoyed. David was wonderful!


Even Katie had to admit that he really was interested
in my welfare.


We arrived in New York to find three of my pictures
running simultaneously on Broadway. (First nighters had
paid a record $11 a seat to see “The Vagabond King.”)
Happily I bought Katie a mink coat, Ann a kidskin outfit,
and myself a leopard coat trimmed in seal. Dad came in
from Boston to greet us.


But the joy of reunion was turned to ashes by word
that David was suffering violent spells of vertigo that
puzzled his doctors. The day I opened at the Palace with
Lou Holtz, David was taken to the hospital for tests. I
saw him every possible moment. “To think I have to miss
you at the Palace!” he lamented. “How I would love to
be out front, watching you! But I've thought of a great
plan--a repeat at the Palace--and I'm going to see about
that booking right from this bed. I'll be in the first row
next time.”


No matter how badly David felt, he seemed to be able
to forget his pain when I was there. It was difficult for
me to realize how ill he really was. As in California, he
pushed his sickness aside. “Just nervous headaches,” he
said. He was gay, charming, lovable.


After the Palace I went on tour, carrying out bookings
he had arranged for me, flying back between engagements
in Buffalo and Washington to be at his side. When
I opened at the Palace the second time, two months later,

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After three exploratory operations, the verdict of his
doctors was brain abscess. Now David was incoherent
much of the time. His nurse, a big, motherly Irish woman,
sought to calm me. “They always talk a bit disconnected
after brain surgery, dear,” she said. “Don't worry
--he'll come out of it.”


One morning he was scheduled for still another operation.
It was Sunday, and I remember telling the interne
early that morning that I had three shows--at two, six
and nine--and would he telephone me if David wanted
me? I gave him the backstage number.


Intuitively I knew the call that came at 5:45 p.m. was
for me. I was putting on my makeup for the second
show. “Oh, God.” I prayed, “don't let anything happen
to him.” On the telephone I heard the interne's voice,
low and grave. “You'd better get down here quickly,
Miss Roth. David is going.”


I left the receiver dangling. I was running barefoot out
the stage entrance when I felt someone grab my shoulders
and whirl me around. It was Harry Richman. He
dragged me struggling back to my dressing room and
threw me sobbing into a chair. “Stop it!” he shouted, and
slapped me. “Where do you think you're going?”


“Let me out of here,” I wept. “Please. David's dying.
Please!”


“Don't you realize,” he went on inexorably, “they're
playing the overture and two thousand people are waiting

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Winchell hurried into the room. “What's going on?”
he demanded. “We're due onstage!”


“Oh, some damn fool has told her that David is dying,”
Harry said distractedly. “What a stupid thing to do! They
don't say things like that on the telephone, do they,
Walter?”


I looked at Walter. He couldn't answer. He was pulling
at his fingers nervously and his eyes were tear-filled. I
thought--isn't that odd? He's reacting just like me.


They kept encouraging me while my maid dressed me,
and then I was before the audience, singing the ridiculous
words of “I'm Flying High, But I've Got a Feeling
I'm Falling.” How can they expect me to sing a happy
song? I can't stop crying. I got through my act and came
off the stage for a moment. Then I would have to return
to do skits with Harry and Walter. Harry hugged me.
“Listen, Lil--keep it up--you're doing swell!”


Then I was onstage again, alive in a nightmare.


When the show was over George Wood, Richman's
manager, rushed me to the hospital in a cab. Now David's
parents can't try to separate us any more, I thought dully.
Nobody can do anything to either one of us any more.


David's mother looked up as I ran down the corridor,
and turned away sobbing. When I opened the door to
David's room, I stared--the bed was made, but he was
not there.


I fled from the room. “No, no, no, no, no!” I screamed.
“I don't believe it! I don't, I don't, I don't!”


His nurse led me to an adjoining room--a nursery--full
of empty cribs. “Oh,” I cried, “we're never going to have
our babies now.”

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She helped me to a chair. “Lillian, dear. Please, now
...you mustn't cry for David. He's with our Lord.”


I turned on her. “Don't talk to me about God!” I
shouted. “David's dead. How could God take him away
now? He was so young, we had so many plans--”


She tried to comfort me. “Maybe you'd like the lifetime
plant your mother sent him,” she said. “No,” I said,
“the plant will live forever and he's dead.”


I heard George's voice. “It's time to go back, kiddie.
You're on in half an hour.”


When I returned to the theatre Harry and Walter were
waiting at the stage door. Walter put his arms around me
and led me to a chair. Then he broke down and had to
walk away.


Harry talked to me. “Listen, Lil,” he said gently. “You
know you're a great artist. You're going out before that
audience and do what you always do to them. You're
going out there because David's watching. He wanted
this for you. You can't fail him.”


I went onstage again. I sang the Huguette waltz, and
something of my youth went from me in the words that
night:


“Never try to bind me, never hope to hold,<br />
Take me as you find me, love and let me go,<br />
Though the loves we leave behind us<br />
Change and fade away<br />
Never mind, we'll have our love some day.”

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER IX


ADELE ROGERS ST. JOHN wrote a syndicated piece
about my tragedy that tore one's heart out. It was titled,
“Take Your Happiness and Love While You May.” Its
moral was that youth was the time for romance.


I wouldn't let David go. Somehow I managed to complete
my week at the Palace. Every entertainer can pull
himself together on the stage, even if he collapses a
moment later in the wings. Offstage, reality came, and
hysteria. I wanted to die. I went into tantrums of self-reproach.
Vainly Katie tried to comfort me. “I never realized
he meant so much to you,” she wept, and her guilt
made me even more despondent.


I imagined I suffered David's vertigo, David's headaches.
Dad came to New York and did all he could to
cheer me up. Nothing helped. A family friend, Ted
Reiner, who had been waiting for me to “grow up,”
hoping against hope that I would marry him, also tried
to console me. Finally, Mother and Ted hired a psychiatric
nurse for me. I was in hysterics most of the time.
Everything tortured me: the mournful sound of the ships
on the Hudson River, the rasp of automobile horns in the
streets below. I could not sleep. I raged about the apartment
convulsed with tears.

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My parents called in a neurologist who recommended
several months' rest in a sanitarium. “I can't sleep even
a few hours a night at home,” I screamed. “How can I
spend months in a sanitarium?”


David, from his hospital bed, had arranged a three
month tour for me of the Paramount-Publix theatres
through the South and West. “Very well,” said the physician.
“Let her go on the tour. She ought to get away.
She's had something close to a nervous breakdown. But
see that she doesn't have time to brood. Have her take
up bridge. It might keep her mind occupied.”


I went on tour. My trunks were full of David's letters
and his photographs. In every town I had his pictures
tacked on the dressing room walls, pushed into the frame
of my dressing room mirror. With me went Ellen, the
psychiatric nurse, a tall, compact girl who was to care
for me, and Katie, who wasn't sure whether it was wise
to come along, but came when I insisted.


Time and again I woke in the night screaming that
David was in the room with me. Katie and Ellen had
their hands full. “He's alive,” I wailed. “He's in the room
now.” The same vivid dream came night after night.
David lay in his hospital bed, his tousled hair as before,
talking to me. “When the nurses come in here with the
doctor,” he whispered, his eyes twinkling, “they'll tell
you I'm dead. But you know I'm not, Lums. Don't believe
them. They can't prove it.” Then the nurses and doctor,
all sad and sorrowful, walked into the room, and David
lay dead, his eyes closed, his head bandaged, his face
waxen. “He's dead, go out of this room,” they chanted.
“He's dead, go out of this room.” Then the nurses and
doctor shook their heads in unison, as if to music, and

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I tried to lose myself in activity. Ellen established a
routine. As soon as we arrived in town, the management
arranged for bridge players to be in my dressing room
between shows. I came off stage, removed my makeup,
and sat for a little while at my dressing table, staring at
a photograph of David. I always had a fresh flower in a
glass before him.


Ellen would slip in silently. “All right, Lillian, our
guests are here.” I would rise like a sleepwalker, walk
into another room where a bridge table had been set up
and a man and woman were already seated, two decks of
cards before them. I would acknowledge the introduction
automatically, sit down, and immerse myself in the game.


Nothing helped. My dreams tormented me. When I
did not dream, I lay awake. Ellen tried--with little success--to
read me to sleep. David, I sobbed, always knew
how to cheer me up. Even when he was in his sick bed,
he could do an impression--a hilarious, double-talking
salesman selling the Brooklyn Bridge; Douglas Fairbanks
leaping across the boudoir of a Persian princess, only to
discover he'd left his sword on the window-seat just as
the prince bounded in, scimitar in hand; the corner newsdealer
doing a slow burn at a man who read the newspapers
but never bought them. Even in our most trying
times, when our families were so hard on us, we laughed
together. He had been my only shield against melancholy
--and now he was gone forever.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00100&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I sought to keep his memory fresh. He had died at 6:20
p.m., Sunday. Each Sunday at that hour, in whatever
city I found myself, I went to my room and remained
alone for a little while.


We played Minneapolis. Then Des Moines. In Kansas
City Katie left for Chicago, to join my sister Ann, who
had returned to show business briefly with Benny Meroff's
act. Katie was almost as despondent as I: she was
convinced that she had only made me feel worse by
coming along. Chicago--and Ann--seemed a sensible idea.


Goodman Ace, then dramatic critic for the Kansas City
<i>Journal-Post</i>, reviewed my opening night favorably. He
wrote sympathetically of my courage in performing so soon
after my great loss. Later he telephoned me. He and his
wife Jane conducted a Sunday radio program, “The Easy
Aces.” He had heard I was a bridge enthusiast. They
talked about bridge on their show: would I like to be his
guest this Sunday at 6 p.m.?


Reluctantly I agreed, for I had no heart to meet
strangers. Before the program, the Aces chatted briefly
with me. Then Mr. Ace said, “By the way, what will you
sing this evening?”


I looked at him is dismay. “Oh, I can't sing on your
program, Mr. Ace,” I said. “Not on a six o'clock program
on Sunday.”


Perhaps I failed to explain it well. But next day in his
column, under some such title as <i>“Mourning Becomes
Roth,”</i> he took me apart. I couldn't sing on his program
because of my bottomless grief, he wrote, but I could
dance at a nightclub the very same evening. What gave
with Roth? What kind of phoney publicity play was she

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00101&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I threw down the newspaper and burst into tears. This
was the unkindest cut of all. “And I didn't even want to
dance,” I cried over and over again to Ellen. “I didn't
want to dance.”


What happened was easily explained. After the show
Ellen and the theatre manager, in an attempt to cheer
me up, persuaded me to go out to supper. “It will be
good therapy,” Ellen assured me. Later, our escort asked
me to dance. I begged off. “Oh, snap out of it, Lillian,”
Ellen said. “Go ahead and dance!” Too indifferent to
make an issue of it, I danced--and one of Mr. Ace's informants
had seen me.


I got through my show, but by midnight I had worked
myself into near hysterics. Nothing Ellen could do
helped put me to sleep. Finally she decided to do something
not found in the psychiatric rule book. “Listen,
Lillian,” she said, going to her bureau drawer and returning
with a bottle, “I want you to take a little drink.
It will make you feel better about everything.”


I took the drink she gave me. Then another. A third--
and I was off to sleep, my first dreamless night in many
nights. And when I woke, rested, I thought: if this is all
I must do to get sleep, I'll do it. It's wonderful. I enjoyed
the taste no more than when I drank on New Year's Eve
with Leo. No matter. I could sleep, and that was a blessing.


The drink Ellen gave me was the fifth I had ever had.


Kansas City. Houston. San Antonio. And nightcaps
each midnight to bring sleep. One night Rose Thurston,
a chorus girl in our vaudeville unit, Ellen and I went for

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00102&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Lillian, the tall one is for you,” Rose said, trying to
cheer me up. I fell in with her mood. “And the short
one's for you, Rose. You know I'm not interested.”


“He's looking at you, Lillian,” Rose said, but I refused
to glance up from my soda. On the way back to the hotel,
Ellen spoke. “I know how you feel about David's memory,
Lillian, but it might help you if you became interested
in someone else. You can't hug a ghost to yourself
forever.”


At noon next day I found myself introduced to Willie
Richards, air cadet, stationed at the San Antonio barracks.
He had telephoned my room that morning, talked
persuasively to Ellen, and arranged to meet me.


He was a long way from his home, Pittsburgh, he said,
and lonely. Would I go dancing with him some night or
maybe flying some day? We dined together and he told
me about himself. His father was a lumber merchant, but
he expected to make his career in the Air Force. He spoke
excitedly about his experiences in training; he was gay
and uncomplicated and likable and I found I welcomed
the chance to get out of myself for a little while.


He had to be in his barracks each night at 10 o'clock;
but for the rest of that week we dined together. I wasn't
the most delightful company. I was reading the philosophies
of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in Will Durant's
<i>Outline of Philosophy</i>, and trying to practice each philosophy

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00103&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You're a funny girl,” Willie said at one point. “I can't
make you out but I sure like you.”


When we were about to leave for Galveston, our next
stop, he became serious. He couldn't bear to think of
San Antonio without me. I was in his blood: he loved
me. He knew it, he said, holding my arm and looking
adoringly at me. He understood the place David had in
my heart, but I was young, and he was young, and together
we would make happiness ours. He could not live
without me.


I was in my Superman mood. “I've had to learn to live
without the man I love,” I said tartly. “You'll have to
learn to live without me.”


Rose and I had a farewell double date our last night
in San Antonio. We were to go to the theatre. The four
of us stopped in Rose's room for a quick pick-me-up of
Texas corn liquor. I had three drinks and blacked out--
the second time in my life. Ellen came, and between
them I was helped back to my own room.


In Galveston the telephone rang every few hours. It
was Willie. He was desperately in love. Yes, we'd known
each other only a short time, but love was like that: this
was it. He was ready to resign his commission in the Air
Force, fly to meet me in Atlanta, the last stop on my tour,
and marry me. All I had to say was yes. Even a whispered

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What under other circumstances would have been
ridiculous suddenly seemed a good idea. I must break
with the morbid past and begin a new life. And why not
with Willie? He was decent, clean-cut, he would not interfere
with my career, he was the kind of fine young
man with whom Katie could find little fault. And he
loved me--wasn't he ready to give up his career for me?
I said finally, “All right, Willie. Come ahead.”


When I told Ellen the news, she took it quietly. I
learned only later that she telephoned Ted, who caught
a plane for Atlanta and when we arrived there, was on
hand to plead his own case.


Ted listed the reasons against my marriage. The boy
had no money; he was too young; it was too soon after
David's death. I had seen Willie all of four--or was it
five?--times, and anyway, he, Ted, mature and understanding,
could take care of me as I needed to be cared
for.


I wouldn't listen. A few hours later Willie arrived. He
walked into my room. I was dressed in my Huguette costume,
posing for a German sculptor who had been assigned
to do a bust of me for the German Hall of Fame
in Berlin. Willie walked in--wearing a ready-made brown
suit with sleeves too short and shoulders too narrow. I
had not seen him in civilian clothes before. I thought,
panicky, “Oh, no! What have I done? I surely can't love
this boy!”


Ted was right. But how could I tell Willie? When Ted
dropped in later, I introduced them. “Mr. Reiner has
come from New York to take me home,” I said. “He's a
friend of the family.”

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Honey, I know what you've been through,” said
Willie, “but leave things to me and I'll make you forget.”
He held me close.


Confusion was added to confusion. The two men
argued over me. “Can't you see she's a sick girl?” Ted
demanded of Willie. “She's going back to New York and
a psychiatrist, and I'm taking her.”


Willie bristled. “You and what army?” he retorted.
“She'll be all right when she marries me. Why, you're an
old man!”


While they argued, I slipped out. My David was dead,
I thought bitterly, and these two men are fighting over
me as though I were something inanimate, without heart
and mind and wishes of my own. What are they trying to
do to me? Why don't they leave me alone!


I walked the streets, distraught. Then I recalled that
an actor I'd known in Hollywood was also in Atlanta,
making a personal appearance in connection with one of
his films. I telephoned him: I was in trouble, I said.
“Two men are in love with me, and I'm completely disgusted
with life and don't know which way to turn. I
don't want to marry either of them.”


He met me twenty minutes later at a bar. I poured
out my heart to him--how wretched I was. One drink
followed another. I blacked out: and sometime in the
night I found myself in my room, but quite unable to
remember how I had gotten there--or what had happened
before. A cold sweat broke out on my forehead:
what <i>had</i> happened? I raged inwardly, and then I was
fitfully asleep, then awake, then asleep.


Slowly, a soft, steady knocking penetrated to my brain.
I struggled awake. I was 5 a.m., and Willie, on the other

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As though drugged I rose, dressed, and let Willie take
me to an all-night restaurant. We might charter a plane
and fly to another state, Willie said, since I was underage
to be married in Georgia. He hurried to a pay station
telephone and called the airfield, while I waited dully at
the table. The gray dawn began to come through the
window.


Willie returned a few minutes later. The ceiling, he
said glumly, was too low to fly.


“O. K. We'll get married here,” he said masterfully.
“You'll fib about your age.”


On the outskirts of town, as the milkcarts clattered by,
he awakened a minister, whose wife and two daughters
stood sleepily at our sides as witnesses. When we got
back into the waiting cab, Willie took me in his arms.
“Honey,” he murmured exultantly, “we're married!”


The words struck me with almost physical force. What
had I done now? Why? The first time in my life I had
made a decision on my own, without Katie--and look at
what I had done!


When we broke the news at the hotel, Ellen stormed
at me. “You're completely out of your mind!” she cried.
“David dead three months, and you married! Ted is right.
You do need a psychiatrist!”


What now? The most sensible procedure was for all
of us to go to New York. That night I lay in my berth
while Willie shaved, making himself handsome for me.
Now and then the train whistle sounded--remote, haunting,
infinitely sad. I thought of David, how close we had

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I jumped up, threw a robe over me, and ran through
half a dozen cars until I reached Ellen's compartment.
“I can't, I can't go through with it,” I said wildly. “I can't
do it.”


Ellen called Ted, and they comforted me. “We can
still handle it,” said Ted. “You stay with Ellen tonight.
We'll annul the marriage soon's we get to New York.”


Five minutes later Willie was pounding on the door.
“Where's my wife?” he demanded. “Darling, what happened
to you?” I sat staring out the window into darkness.
Willie wasn't to blame. I had said yes. He had quit
the Air Force. How could I do this to him? I stood up.
“You'd better open the door, Ellen,” I said. “I'm going
back with him.”


In the dining car next morning we sat down to breakfast.
Ted said to Willie, “You'll have to keep the marriage
secret or it will ruin Lillian's career. What will her public
think? David dead three months and she married.”


“You've got to cooperate, Willie,” Ellen said. And
Willie agreed.


But as we got off the train, the newspapers thrust in
my face had the story: “LILLIAN ROTH MARRIED
SECRETLY TO FLYER.”


Katie came flying in from Chicago, Arthur from Boston.
There was a family conference. I was ill, no question of
it. I would be taken to a psychiatrist, one of the most
eminent in the country, Dr. A. A. Brill, author of <i>Basic
Principles of Psychoanalysis</i>.


Meanwhile, for whatever it might mean, I could brood
over the fact that so far as the New York <i>Daily Graphic</i>

[p. <i>102</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Brill saw me after talking in turn to my father,
mother, Ellen and Willie. When I entered his office, he
greeted me with a smile. “You're not at all the wild
woman I expected to see,” he remarked, and told me to
sit down. He looked at me searchingly. “Suppose you
tell me what this is all about?”


“Haven't the others told you already?”


He chuckled. An elderly, paternal man, with a short
goatee, he had an air of complete relaxation about him.
“Yes, but they're a little upset. You look like a sensible
girl. You tell me.”


“Doctor, I'm all mixed up.” I told him about David,
of the romance not consummated, of the almost hypnotic
hold his memory had. I told him of my dreams, my uncontrollable
tears and tantrums. I told him of the pent-up
energy that made me, sometimes, feel I would burst. I
told him of my feelings toward men: I was physically
attracted to men, but repelled by intimacies. I told him
of the man who had painted me when I was five, of my
confusion about sex. We spent hours reviewing my child-hood,

[p. <i>103</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You don't love Willie, do you?” he asked.


No. But he was sweet. I liked him.


“You married him before you recovered from the shock
of David's death,” Dr. Brill observed. “You weren't ready
for marriage. Suppose we get Willie reinstated in the
Air Force. Then you could get an annulment and Willie,
from what I've seen of him, won't be too badly hurt by
this brief episode.”


The reinstatement, however, didn't go through. Dr.
Brill called me in again. The best thing to do for the
time being, he said, was to go away with my husband.
“You're a nice little girl basically,” he went on. “But
you've had a couple of bad shocks and a great sorrow.
You can afford a trip to Europe, can't you?” I nodded.
“Well, then, take it. Get away from your family and from
nurses for a few weeks. Then come back and see me.”


It was sixteen years before I saw Dr. Brill again. He
sent me to a mental institution then.

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER X


HAD I not been drinking, would I have married
Willie? I was not much of a drinker then. When I took
liquor, it was for escape--or, as I liked to say, medicinally.
Without knowing it, I was being given my first
lesson in the witchcraft of alcohol. For after a drink or
two, liquor made me the kind of girl I wanted to be--
free of repressions, unfettered by conscience, able to take
love and life in my stride.


When I first saw Willie, an idea floated temptingly on
the far edge of my mind: <i>Wouldn't it he glorious to go
off with such a dashing, handsome, soldier-flyer?</i>


But Lillian, my sober conscience warned me, that isn't
right. You're in mourning. You mustn't, you mustn't....


It was the drink--the quick drink or two--that made
me forget this pious thought. The quick drink opened all
the closed doors.


Dr. Brill had told us to get away as soon as possible.
However, I had personal appearances to do in Toronto
and Montreal, and Willie was eager for me to meet his
parents, so we stopped off in Pittsburgh en route to
Canada.


In Pittsburgh I discovered that I was pregnant. I was

[p. <i>105</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After my Canadian engagements we stopped for a
week end in Atlantic City. I still carried David's pictures;
they were on our dresser where Willie couldn't
help seeing them. He was miserable, and I was miserable.
One rainy night we both became gloriously drunk. We
walked, arm linked in arm, on the boardwalk, reeling and
singing, the rain in our faces, stopping every little while
to drink from the bottle of bourbon Willie carried on his
hip.


Later we staggered to our room. Depression seized us.
Gusts of rain pattered against our windows. The roar of
the surf was in our ears. It was a night for high deeds
and final acts. I found myself telling Willie that I could
never love him: my heart was still with David. I cried,
and Willie broke down, too. I was no good for leading
him on and he was no good for making me marry him.
And now the baby was on its way to complicate matters
still more.


“We could kill ourselves,” Willie said. “That would be
final. That would settle everything.”


We wept for our young lives that were to be snuffed
out so soon. But how? Would it be more in the great
tradition to join hands and walk into the ocean to our
death? Or should Willie charter a plane and crash-dive
us to eternity?


We woke next morning with excruciating hangovers.
We looked at each other, slowly packed, and went on to
New York. I bought Willie half a dozen suits at $165 each

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00112&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I lay ill at the Prince of Wales Hotel in Paris. We had
done the French capital swiftly and madly, sleeping all
day, playing all night. I was ill not only from drinking,
but from all I had attempted to prevent an unwanted
baby from coming into the world.


One afternoon I managed to go with Willie to the
Grand Prix at Deauville. I fainted during the third race:
Willie rushed me back to Paris. I lost our baby on the
operating table at the American hospital.


I was very ill. I feared I would die. I wanted desperately
to see Katie. Though I had scarcely enough strength
to speak, I telephoned her in New York. “Mom, I miss
you terribly,” I said. “Come over here. You always
wanted to see Europe, and now you're going to see it.”


Her happiness bubbled over three thousand miles of
cable. “Lilly, I'll be on the next boat! With bells on!”


Suppose I should not last until she arrived? The doctors,
suggesting wine as a blood builder, had prescribed
a glass of red wine for lunch, a sparkling Burgundy for
dinner, and a pint of champagne before retiring. I tripled
the dose.


When Katie arrived, we drove to meet her at Le Havre.
In the following weeks we took her everywhere: the
Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Folies Bergere, Maxims.
We drove to Versailles and Fontainebleau. Ill as I was,
I enjoyed her delight, for she was like a child in fairyland.


After Paris, Geneva. The doctors had ordered me to
avoid strenuous exercise. I disregarded their orders: I
went riding daily, even learned to jump hurdles. I wanted

[p. <i>107</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00113&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We returned to America, arriving in New York in late
August, 1930. The trip had taken two months. It had
cost me $25,000.


Now I was earning a great deal of money, but it was
meaningless. In addition to my appearance in the new
Earl Carroll Vanities, I made short subjects for Paramount.
Among these were the Fleisher cartoons in which
I led the audience in songs while a ball bounced from
word to word of the lyric as it flashed on the screen, a
verse at a time. I sang “Down Among the Sugar Cane,”
“Honeysuckle Rose,” and “Let's Fall in Love.” Every
song was an ironic parody of my own state of mind.


Willie and I threw at least two big parties a week in
our new terrace apartment overlooking Central Park. We
hired a secretary, maid and butler-chauffeur. I bought a
custom-built ruby-red Hudson, a display model that had
cost the Hudson people nearly $10,000 to manufacture,
but which they sold me for $4,800 in consideration of my
appearance in their ads.


The car would have delighted an Indian prince. It
was upholstered in beige lambskin. The handles were 14-carat
gold. An ivory vanity with gold-trimmed mirror
was built into the horn of the steering wheel. In the back
was an ivory French lacewood bar. The car also held
compartments in which were fitted a motion picture

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00114&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I bought more furs for Katie and myself: minks, ermines,
Persian lamb, silver fox capes. I did a Lubitsch,
all in gray--gray suede suit, gray kidskin boots trimmed
with gray fur cuffs, gray stockings, gunmetal gray Russian
hat. I had a similar costume in black Persian. I had
a $10,000 diamond ring, a $1,000 wedding band, gloves
monogrammed in diamonds. I spent wildly. David and
I had saved so frugally to have a home. But David was
dead, and why save money now?


Nothing consoled me. Night after night, after Willie
fell asleep, I cried for David, thinking, if only he were
lying close to me.


When I worked, my drinking was subconsciously
timed. No more than four whiskey sours each night, after
the show. On Sundays, however, the secret strategist
hidden in my brain plotted it more elaborately.


Although I was never too happy in furs and jewels,
they were expected of a star, and so on Sundays I bedecked
myself with them, and Willie and I made our
appearance at our first port of call--Toots Shor's Five
O'clock club, where everybody who was anybody was
always found at Sunday cocktail hour. Toots himself,
whom I had met when I was fifteen, in Philadelphia, always
gave us a warm welcome. We sat at my favorite
post, a table near the entrance, where we could see everyone
and everyone could see us.


Par for the course here was three old-fashioneds: four,
if you were in the mood; I always was. Experts explained

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The hand of the clock moved on; and presently we
were making our gay goodbyes and adjourned to the
Stork Club, where everybody who was anybody was always
found at Sunday dinner. Again our entrance, properly
timed and skillfully executed: Lillian Roth, star of
stage, screen and radio, and her adoring Willie, six feet
of blond, handsome manhood.


Naturally, it was not <i>comme il faut</i> to order dinner
directly: the tang of the old-fashioneds had mellowed,
and--so the best authorities held--nothing quite picked
you up again as well as a straight rye--with a water
chaser. That guaranteed an honest-to-goodness <i>bon
appétit</i>.


Then one ordered--steak chateaubriand for two, and
a <i>salade</i> which your own lovely hands (stubby fingers forgotten)
would mix, with just a <i>soupçon</i> of garlic. And while
you waited--for Sherman Billingsley was undoubtedly
standing at the broiler, stopwatch in hand, to assure the
exact degree of succulence--perhaps a second rye,
straight. A second rye went exquisitely with the crisp,
gleaming celery, the delightfully bitter olives, the radishes
red as your own flushed cheeks.


Reluctantly, since all good things must come to an end,
you turned to your food--and wines. Naturally you ordered
sparkling Burgundy because everyone knew red
wine complemented good red meat.


For dessert--when the huge newspaper-size bill of fare
was thrust into your hands and your eyes finally focused
on the print--what else but cherry jubilee? Followed, as

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The violins sobbed, and the Huguette in me stirred and
woke. How sweet, how tragic, how bitter-sweet we all
are, everyone of us, in a world we never made! How
warm I feel! How wonderful to float away on rivers
mysterious as poems whose words just escape you, to
float away, serene and queenly, into unseen beauties of
heart and mind and soul.... The hum of voices, the
warmth, the glow, the white tablecloths, the red wines,
the walls, the sobbing violins, all begin to spin....


“Honey, I better take you home. Right now!” It's
Willie's voice, from far away. A strong right arm to help
me rise, unsteadily. How much I love the world! “Willie,
I'm so hot!” Maybe I would make it to the ladies' room,
maybe not. But I doubt if I was as beautiful in my exit
as in my entrance.


Willie worked out a plan. If we were to buy a plane--
a three-passenger Curtis Wright, costing about $2,500--
he could fly packages for a department store. I bought the
plane. Willie had several forced landings while flying
about seeking the contracts that never materialized. We
argued hotly. I didn't like him to fly. He might be killed
and I would hold myself responsible.


“O. K.” he said dejectedly. “I'll go back to Pittsburgh
and see if I can't work out something in Dad's lumber-yard.”


I drove him to the airport and saw him off. After he left,
I thought, poor Willie. I wouldn't let him accept a pilot's
job, and that was the one thing he had been trained for.

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At night, after my performance, I drank heavily. I was
out to forget something. I wasn't sure it was David anymore,
though I broke down thinking of him every night.
But I continued my work, and shortly went on tour of a
number of Paramount's Eastern Theatres.


The day I was to open at the Newark Paramount, Katie
and I passed the front of the theatre on the way to morning
rehearsal. My name was up in lights as the headliner.
When we returned, however, a large pennant fluttered
conspicuously above the marquee. In enormous gold
letters against a black field, it read: MILTON BERLE--
IN PERSON!


Katie stopped. “Where is he ‘in person’ from?” she
demanded. “He's never made a picture.” She walked backstage
to find Mrs. Berle. “Sarah--I mean Sandra--” she
said. “Where in the world did you get that flag?” Mrs.
Berle laughed. “Oh, Katie, we always carry Milton's flag
with us.”


Mother and I went into a fit of laughter in my dressing
room. “Shall we ask the manager to take it down?” I
asked. Mother dismissed the idea. “If Sarah--I mean
Sandra--can drag that flag about, let her have it. The
audience knows who's the headliner.”

CHAPTER XI


A COURTEOUS little man in a gaberdine coat was
waiting when I returned late one night from Newark.


“Miss Roth?” he said, and presented me with an envelope.
In it was a summons to appear in municipal
court. I owed a garage bill of $232 for repairs and storage
for my old car during my trip abroad. I had refused to
pay it, contending that all I owed was $32 for storage,
since I had not requested any repairs. The summons was
the garageman's answer.


Katie and I appeared in court the day I was to open
at the Paramount Theatre in New York with Georgie
Jessel, Burns &amp; Allen and Bing Crosby. I was twenty, and
although I looked the picture of innocence in a little
black princess dress with big white organdy collar, and
a little white, off-the-face hat, I was suffering from a
violent hangover. My mouth felt as though it were lined
with absorbent cotton.


Waiting for the case to be called, I grew impatient.
“Oh, Mom, let's pay the money and get out of here,” I
exclaimed. But Mother decided we ought to see it
through. She added, “Look at the judge, Lilly. Doesn't
he look young to be sitting up there?”


I was too bleary-eyed to see him clearly, so we moved

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00119&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When my case was called, I went before him, and
began, “Your Honor, I--”


He interrupted me. “You have a lawyer to speak for
you, Miss.” Well, I thought, isn't he nasty! My lawyer
requested an adjournment, pointing out that I would be
busy for the next three weeks.


“Is this so, Miss Roth?” His Honor asked. “Yes, Judge,”
I said meekly. He looked at me for a moment, and then
smiled--a captivating smile that made him look almost
boyish. “There's a great deal of unemployment about
today, and if the young lady has work, we certainly don't
want to keep her from it. Case adjourned until three
weeks from today.”


For the first time since David's death my heart felt
lighter. “Oh, Mom,” I whispered as we walked out. “I've
just got to meet him. Isn't he adorable?”


She squeezed my arm. “He certainly is, darling.”


Georgie Jessel, who was on the Paramount bill with
me, didn't know the judge. Neither did Burns and Allen,
nor Bing Crosby, nor anyone else in the show whom I
asked. Nearly three weeks later I came across Taps
Shaurnstein, an agent, who knew him. “I see him in
Lindy's every night,” he said.


“I've got to meet him,” I said breathlessly. “He's the
most adorable thing I ever saw.”


Taps laughed. “Tell you what. After the show tonight,
drop into Lindy's casually with your mother and I'll introduce
you.”


Lindy's restaurant, on Broadway and 51st Street, was

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00120&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“We're up here at Pomerantz',” said Taps. “He changed
his mind.”


We hurried out, hailed my chauffeur, and drove wildly
through the rain to Pomerantz', another restaurant some
thirty blocks north on Broadway. When we entered I
saw the judge at a table, and my heart began to thump.
I began twisting my handkerchief like a 15-year-old.


“I want you to meet Miss Lillian Roth and her
mother,” said Taps, doing the honors. “This is Judge
Shalleck and his brother Joe.”


The judge had a little smile as he shook my hand. He
knew I had come up in the downpour to meet him. There
was silence for a moment. Joe Shalleck, who I'd heard
was a well-known criminal lawyer, began the conversation.


“Who are you?”


“My name is Lillian Roth.”


“I know that. But what do you do?”


I stared at him coldly. “I walk a tightrope,” I said.


“I see you bite your nails,” he went on blandly. “What
are you so nervous about? Look what you're doing to
your handkerchief.”


“That's just a little idiosyncrasy of mine,” I retorted.
“And anyway, look how you chew your cigar.” I was
furious. I wanted to get up and walk out.


“You've got a case coming up before my brother--tomorrow,

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00121&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“No,” I said, ready to cry with mortification. “What's
$232 to me?”


“It seems strange that we should meet the night before.”


I rose. “I'm leaving. Can I drop you anywhere? I have
a car outside.”


They strolled out with me. “Is that your car--the red
one?” demanded the judge, in a tone of disbelief. “I
wouldn't be seen riding in that fire-engine! Why, it's the
gaudiest thing I ever saw.”


“It's not red, it's iridescent ruby,” I said icily. “As
far as I'm concerned, you can both walk. It will do you
good.” With that parting shot I assisted my mother into
the car and followed regally; our chauffeur tipped his hat,
and we drove off.


“I hate men like that!” I almost wept. “I won't go into
that courtroom tomorrow.”


In the morning, however, I was there, as I knew I
would be. Judge Shalleck ruled against me; by the time
I paid my lawyer, the case had cost me well over $400.


The judge called me before him. “Are you satisfied
with the verdict?”


“Should I be?”


“Well, if you want to be technical, perhaps not.”


“You mean you're having doubts about your decision?
Isn't that a strange admission for a judge?”


He reddened slightly. “Miss Roth, you are morally responsible
for this debt, even if you are a minor. And
you're able to pay it.”

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“That's perfectly all right with me,” I said curtly.
“Goodbye.”


“Now, now, wait a minute,” he said placatingly. “I'm
just reading about you--in Winchell's column.” He had
the New York <i>Daily Mirror</i> spread open before him. I
leaned over to read: “Lillian Roth and her flyer spouse
are straining at the handcuffs.”


“Well!” I said with some spirit, “no wonder I lost my
case if you're reading a paper while it went on!”


He grinned. “Seriously,” he said, “is there any truth
in it?”


I drew on my gloves. “Well, in a way it's so.”


He picked up his gavel and toyed with it. “Be home
tonight,” he said. “I'll call you.”


“Is that a court order?” I retorted.


He laughed, and I laughed.


We drank beer at a speakeasy the following evening.
I felt as self-conscious as a little girl. I had headlined
with famous personalities, I had seen police holding back
crowds struggling to see me, I had signed hundreds of
autographs--yet I was in awe of this 34-year-old judge of
the municipal court bench.


On the way home he asked, “When are you going to
be divorced?”


The question was completely unexpected. As a matter
of fact, I hadn't thought about divorce. “Well, I really
don't know,” I replied.


“My brother can handle it for you,” the judge said.
“Why don't you see him tomorrow?”


We were at the entrance of my hotel. “Good-night,”
he said, and kissed me. It was April, the first anniversary
of my marriage to Willie.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00123&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Joe Shalleck was helpfulness itself. A Mexican divorce
could be arranged. All I was required to do was telephone
Willie in Pittsburgh to sign the necessary papers.


“I can't do that,” I said unhappily. “I just couldn't
break it to him.”


Joe Shalleck understood. If that's the way I felt, he
would handle that, too.


Two days later a heartbroken Willie was in my hotel
room, weeping. How could I do this to him? I wavered,
on the verge of calling off the divorce. After all, I liked
Willie and he was in love with me. The telephone rang.
Judge Shalleck was in the lobby, waiting to take me for
a drive.


“Please,” Willie begged. “I'm sick, Lillian, I need you.
I've lost twenty pounds, Lillian. I've got tuberculosis.”


I knew he was playing on my sympathy, but I had too
much experience with illness to dismiss his words. “All
right, Willie,” I said “I'll call your mother tonight and if
what you say is true, I'll go back with you.”


I went out with the judge. Willie took a room at the
hotel.


His mother told me there was nothing wrong with
Willie, when I called her. She understood my position:
she agreed that we were not meant for each other.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00124&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XII


IF JUDGE SHALLECK wants me to divorce Willie, I reasoned,
he must want to marry me. He was one of the
town's eligible bachelors, I knew. He had only recently
been elected to the bench. He was proud of the telegram
he showed me not long after our first meeting, from Governor
Franklin D. Roosevelt, congratulating him. “From
what the Counsel to the Governor has told me of your
ability and experience and qualifications,” it read, “I am
sure you will make a very splendid record.” Ironically,
years later, in 1949, Ben Shalleck was defeated for Congressman
on the democratic ticket by Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Jr.


I day-dreamed. I would be a judge's wife. I would have
a home, and children, and a warm family circle. My life
would take on meaning and stability.


The divorce went through on schedule. As a parting
gift I gave Willie the plane he loved so much. I began
seeing the judge almost nightly. His courtship was nothing
to fill a girl's diary. He arrived around nine o'clock,
the <i>Mirror</i> and <i>Daily News</i> under his arm, and two nickle
packages of mints for me. He greeted me, settled himself
comfortably on the sofa, and lost himself in his newspapers.
Once a week he took me to a fight or a hockey
game.

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My grand passion began to subside. Was this how a
man treated a woman whose divorce he had arranged?
I felt like an iniquitous woman, for he never spoke of
marriage.


I went on a two-week tour. When I returned a friend
told me the judge had been dining a girl he used to go
with. I was furious. He rarely dined <i>me</i>. I was the girl he
visited! Where was he now? In Chicago, at the Democratic
National Convention, with his pal, Jimmy Hines,
democratic leader in New York.


I took the first plane for Chicago, marched into his
hotel and rang him from the lobby. “This is Lillian. I'm
downstairs.”


“Come up,” he said calmly.


I walked into his room. Before he could get the cigar
out of his mouth to kiss me, I demanded, “Is it true
you've been taking someone else out while I was away?”


He looked at me for a moment, and slowly replaced his
cigar. “Do I ask you who you go out with?”


“I haven't been going out with anyone else, but if that's
the way it is, O. K. Goodbye!” I strode toward the door.


“Wait a minute,” he said. “Wouldn't you like to stay
over for the nominations? Here with me?”


I whirled on him. “No!” I screamed. “I nominate you
Cad of 1932! You and your gavel and your cigar!” I
slammed the door behind me.


I took the next plane to New York, threw myself into
my work, and tried to forget the judge. I was to open
almost immediately at the Capitol Theatre, making personal
appearances with Abe Lyman, Milton Berle and
Bette Davis. As I hurried up Broadway to the Capitol, I
saw that Milton's name was above mine on the marquee.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was too much. The friendly feud we'd had
through the years was all very well, but enough was
enough. My contract called for first billing, and suddenly
I was the Lillian Roth who walked out on Earl Carroll
years before. I laid down an ultimatum to the Capitol
management: I wanted my top billing.


To those not in the profession, it may seem childish to
take billings so seriously. But you work hard to become
a star: you fight to keep the position you've won. When
you drop from it, the thud echoes from Broadway to
Hollywood.


Inexplicably, Milton came down with a heart flutter
in his dressing room. He was sure he couldn't go on. It
took high finesse to meet this crisis. While Milton rested
in his room, an emissary was sent to me. Would I consent
to split billing? My name would be first on the side of
the marquee facing downtown. Milton wanted his first
on the opposite side--facing Lindy's restaurant.


“All right,” I said. “Let Milton's friends at Lindy's see
that he has top billing. I'd rather be first in the eyes of
the people coming up from the subways.”


The judge returned to New York and began telephoning
me once a week. My feeling toward him had chilled:
our conversations were almost impersonal. “Well,” he
concluded each one, “I guess I'll be seeing you around
sometime.” “That's right,” I replied coldly. “You'll see
me around--unless I see you first.”


I was not at a loss for dates. On the rebound from the
judge, I met a tall, dark, handsome magician, Fred Keating,
who was on the bill with Russ Columbo and me at
the Brooklyn Paramount. Fred was gay, witty, ready to

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I walked into the judge's court to say goodbye,
he called me up on the bench beside him. “I'm going to
California,” I said without preface. He laughed. “I don't
believe it.”


I swallowed my pride. “Ben, I don't have to go. You
could keep me here. But once I leave, you'll never see
me again.”


He ruffled some papers in front of him. “I don't like
to make decisions for you,” he said noncommittally.
“Shall I see you to the train?”


“No,” I snapped. “Someone else is seeing me off.” I
almost ran from the courtroom.


That night Fred Keating kissed me goodbye, and I was
enroute to Hollywood. Almost upon arrival, I was cast
with Barbara Stanwyck in “Ladies They Talk About.”
In it I sang, “If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight.”


Liquor, I thought, was no problem at this time. I could
take it or leave it. Mostly I took it--though not while the
picture was shooting. I drank to forget. The judge had
ruined everything. Why hadn't I stayed with Willie,
sweet, likable Willie? Or gone along with fun-loving

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The men with whom I now went out in Hollywood
were interested only in one-night romances. I drank
heavily. Frequently I blacked out, waking foggily at four
or five in the morning, with no memory of what had
happened. That frightened me. Where was all this leading
to?


Warner Brothers, seeing the rushes of “Ladies They
Talk About,” promptly offered me a three-year contract
at $1,500 a week. I spent several days in agonized indecision;
and then, fortified with bourbon one night, I telephoned
the judge.


“Hiya, Judgie,” I greeted his voice, gaily. “There's a
decision I want you to make--in my favor.”


“What a nice surprise,” he said, and his voice was cool
over the wire. “But you shouldn't be spending your
money on long-distance calls.”


“Listen, Ben,” I rushed the words. “Warner's are ready
to give me a three-year contract. If I take it, I stay out
here. I've been getting your ‘Dear Lillian-Sincerely, Ben’
letters. I really don't know what to think anymore. Ben--
do you want me or don't you want me? You must make
up your mind.”


There was silence at the other end. Then: “I'll take a
couple of weeks off at Christmas and come out there and
we'll talk about it,” he said.


When I hung up, I knew I had to settle this. I took
another drink, packed my bags, flew to New York, and
telephoned Ben. I was in New York, I told him. I would

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I entered his apartment, Joe Shalleck was there,
too.


“Hello, Ben,” I said. “I see you have your legal counsel
with you. When do we set the date, boys?”


Ben carefully lit his cigar. Joe spoke: “Yes, Ben, why
don't you name the day?”


“All right, John Alden,” I snapped. “Let Ben speak for
himself. He's pretty good, when he tries.”


There was a silence. Ben drew pensively at his cigar.
“Well, I don't know,” he said finally. He looked at me,
and his voice took on a judicial tone, as though he were
summarizing a case. “You're certainly not the most beautiful
girl in the world. You're certainly not the most brilliant.
But there's something about you--maybe the way
you crinkle your nose--or maybe I love you when you're
angry--but you set the date.”


“As far as I'm concerned, we can be married tomorrow,”
I said.


Joe spoke up again. “I'll order the invitations,” he said.
“The wedding's on me.”


It was set for January 29, 1933.


The newspapers treated our nuptials with the dignity
befitting a judge's wife-to-be. Wrote the New York <i>Sun</i>,
on December 13, 1932: “The engagement of Miss Lillian
Roth, stage and screen actress, and Municipal Court

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“The wedding will take place in January. Miss Roth
will give up the stage and make her final public appearance
at the Broadway Theatre on Sunday night for the
James J. Hines Christmas Fund, the proceeds to go to
buy Christmas dinners for the poor ...”


“You understand,” Ben had said, “you'll have to forget
your career.” I knew that. I wanted a normal life. I didn't
like myself in California. I didn't like the kind of men who
took me out, nor the drinking, nor the blackouts. What
had Paul Bern told me when I first arrived in Hollywood,
Stardust dazzling my eyes? The men in my life would
make or break me.


Without misgivings I gave up my career at high tide.
M-G-M phoned me from Hollywood. Paramount wanted
me for an important part. Warner's offered to co-star me
with Loretta Young in “She Couldn't Say No.”


To them all, I could--and did--say no.


The elaborate wedding reception at the Savoy Plaza
was at four, the ceremony at nine, the train for Florida
left at ten. Mother was tearful but happy, my father
drank toasts to everyone. I was gay over repeated goblets
of champagne. The guest list of 1,000 was a rollcall
of stage and political personalities: Jimmy Hines, New
York Democratic leader, Judge and Mrs. Samuel Rosen-man,
Justice John J. Sullivan, Basil O'Connor, former

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Ben and I left, Dad was asleep in a chair in the
lobby. I bent over and kissed him. He lifted one eyelid.
“Take care of my baby,” he mumbled, and fell asleep
again.


The moment Ben and I were alone in our drawing
room, butterflies struck my stomach. I was locked in. It
was as it had been with Willie, all over again. <i>Now what
have I done? Why did I pursue this? I don't love
him</i>. ...


Desperately I wanted a drink. “Isn't there any more
champagne?” I asked Ben. “You won't need it, darling,”
he said, as he pulled me to him.


After he fell asleep, I lay awake as the train sped
through the night, listening to the long, haunting whistle
at the crossings, staring out the window at the stars. The
moon rode high and clear; the nearest stars were all but
invisible. But farther up the sky, they shone large and
bright. Was it true that each person who dies has a star
to look out from? Was David looking down at me, and
what was he thinking?


Our second night in Miami the judge heard me rummaging
in my trunk. He came into the bedroom. “I've
been looking everywhere for some papers,” he remarked.

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I don't think so, Ben,” I said hurriedly. “I'm sure she
didn't.


“Let me look.” He searched my trunk and in each
drawer he found a quart of liquor hidden under the
lingerie.


“What have you all this for?” he asked in astonishment.


“Well,” I said nervously, “I thought--well--I thought
we might give some parties here--”


“Oh, Lillian! You know liquor is available here.”


I tried to make clear that I wasn't going to drink the
liquor, I just had to know that it was there.


“Why do you have to know it's there?” he asked.


“I don't know, Ben!” I said wildly. “Let me alone. I
just have to know it's there!”


Many friends from show business were in Miami that
week--Sid Skolsky, Jack Benny, Walter Winchell--but it
was a stormy week for Ben and me, with tears and arguments
over my drinking. We went on to Havana, where
I fell in love with Presidentes, cocktails heavily laced
with absinthe. I passed out several times: absinthe was
powerful, but it wasn't going to beat me. I drank more
Presidentes, and lay most of the day in a stupor on the
beach.


In the train back to New York, Ben asked, “Is this the
way our married life is going to be, Lillian? Are you just
going to continue to drink?”


“I don't do anything wrong, Ben,” I replied miserably.
“And I'm really not drinking so much. Don't I really behave
all right? But if it worries you, I promise it'll be

[p. <i>127</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our apartment--with an extra bedroom for the baby
we hoped to have--overlooked a magnificent vista of
Central Park, with its blue lake gleaming like a jewel in
a green setting. I indulged in a spree of decorating, and
I was proud to think that I was one of the first in New
York to use bold white and black: white walls, black
velvet couches, zebra-striped pillows, white leather seats,
a modern bedroom with spun-glass walls. I had everything
a woman could want: youth, position, a handsome,
respected husband, and I was financially independent--
money I had earned, a bank account of more than a
quarter of a million dollars. What more could I desire?


“Why not,” I suggested to Ben some weeks later, “why
not have open house once a week? I love to watch people
have fun and I want to help you politically.”


Thus began the tradition of the Shallecks' Saturday
night parties. They were successful from the start. Besides
Mother and Ann, our steady guests included many
who had been at our wedding, as well as such friends as
Georgie Jessel, Lita Gray Chaplin, Milton Berle and Nino
Martini.


Ben was delighted after the first party. “You were a
wonderful hostess, darling,” he said. “I was proud of you.
You hardly drank.”


“Of course not, Ben,” I said, and I believed it. “When
I have exciting things to do, I never think of a drink.”


He was unaware that I had fortified myself before the

[p. <i>128</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ben could not know how I dreaded going to sleep.
Strange memories and fears assailed me. David had died
paralyzed and blind. My father had been virtually paralyzed
that night as he sat in a drunken stupor after beating
Katie. I had lain paralyzed when the old man with
the cigar painted me, so long ago. So many nights, lying
next to Ben, I closed my eyes and thought I slept, yet
strangely, I was awake ... I must be awake because I
could look across the room and see the dressing table
with my perfumes on it. I could see the chair opposite our
bed--first its legs, then the judge's shoes and socks, then
his trousers neatly placed across the chair, then his shirt
and jacket carefully placed above the trousers--all precisely,
meticulously laid out, ready for the next day. “All
that's missing is his gavel,” I thought, and giggled. Or
was I giggling? Was I awake? I couldn't move. Invisible
chains bound me. I tried to scream, but no sound came.
My throat was locked. <i>Now I'm screaming but he doesn't
hear me. Easy, easy ... this will pass. You'll have it
again, but it will pass</i>. ... Then, unexpectedly, I could
move. I would get out of bed, my heart thumping madly,
my body soaked in perspiration, and with a shaking hand
pour myself a drink, and then another, and then another,
from the bottle I now had hidden in the clothes hamper

[p. <i>129</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When a woman wants a child and cannot have it, her
yearning can become an obsession. Motherhood, I
thought, would bring me the peace I sought. It would
dull that indefinable ache, the loneliness that was my
other self, the something I wanted I knew not what.
Perhaps I would find contentment if I had a child of my
own upon whom I could pour the love locked in my
heart, the love I could give to no man save David and his
memory.


In vain Ben and I consulted physicians. No babies
came. Had the child been a boy, his name would have
been Charles; a girl, Anna--both named for Ben's father
and mother. We had it all arranged. In the end, I resigned
myself to being childless.


Yet I had to keep busy. Perhaps mothering other
people's children was the answer. Soon I was taking a
score of orphans to my home of an afternoon, arranging
little parties, serving ice cream and cake, and surprising
them with little gifts. I took them on auto trips to the
zoo and sometimes to the circus.


With Molly Minsky, wife of the burlesque impresario,
I founded a philanthropic organization, the Charlanna
League, named for the children I could not have, to raise
funds for the Second Street Day Nursery. I held luncheons
and cocktail parties which sometimes began at three
p.m. and lasted through midnight. There was a kitty on
the bar; at the end of the party I found many $50 and
$100 bills.

[p. <i>130</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Others in our group were Mrs. Berle and her daughter
Rosalind, Lita Chaplin, Mitzi Green and her mother,
Florence Lustig and Ruth Bernstein, old friends, and
Ben's sister, Estelle Milgrim. We held bazaars and rummage
sales, and raised considerable amounts of money.
A glass of beer kept me amiable for hours at the sales.
After I came home, however, I had to take several
straight drinks, and even a stronger nightcap to ward
off my fearsome dreams.


In the few years my League was in existence, I resigned
three times. Some new members resented the
strict parliamentary rules I insisted upon at meetings.
(Ben had taught me this.) I was high-handed, they complained.
Perhaps I was. I worked hard, and never failed
to fortify myself before a meeting.


What particularly incensed me was the charge that I
engaged in charity work for publicity. At one meeting I
announced:


“I've been glorified internationally and I don't need
the glory of a hundred women. If you think I'm doing
this for personal publicity, I'm resigning. I'll do my own
charity work.”


High-handed or not, apparently I could raise money,
and each time a resolution was passed to invite me back.
The final straw came during a particularly cold February
when nearly all the members were wintering in Florida.
I called a meeting of the handful in New York and we
voted $1,000 from the treasury to buy shoes and snow-suits
for needy youngsters.


When the sojourning members returned, they put me
on the carpet. “These children managed to live all these
years without you,” one woman snapped. “You had no

[p. <i>131</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was too hurt to answer. I resigned for good, and went
home. Couldn't I get along with anyone? Couldn't anything
work out right for me?


Although beer by day and liquor by night satisfied me
while I was busy in the Charlanna League, now my
nerves demanded more. I switched from a morning beer
to a jigger of liquor first thing after I awoke.


It seemed a good formula. I improved upon it by pouring
two ounces of bourbon into my breakfast orange
juice, so the judge was none the wiser. One afternoon I
was shopping at Saks-Fifth Avenue with Ruth Bernstein.
I stood examining charm bracelets at the counter, when
the store began to spin. Sweat streamed from my forehead
and splashed in large drops on the counter before
me. My knees began to buckle. I couldn't swallow.


I clutched Ruth. “Get me outside.”


I leaned against the storefront and the cold air revived
me. I caught my breath. “Oh,” I said. “But that was a
bad moment. Must be something I ate.” We continued
shopping. A few minutes later, while Ruth was trying on
a hat in another store, it happened again.


She managed to steer me outside, where the people
and the traffic and the noise of the avenue rushed headlong
at me. She hailed a cab and opened the windows.
“Should I take you to a doctor?” she asked anxiously.


“No--I can't swallow--get me water, quick!” I gasped.


The knowing cabbie, who overheard us, stopped before
a bar. The bartender took one glance at me.


“Water, hell,” he exclaimed. “She needs a drink.” He
poured out a tumbler of rye. “Here, get this down, Miss.”

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The bartender watched me. “These spells come often?”
he asked casually. I shook my head. “Take a tip, Miss,”
he said, “carry a shot or two with you in the future.”


I realized that I could never go out of the house again
without liquor. Orange juice and bourbon in the morning
was not enough. The physical demand was growing. I
would need liquor more often--not because I wanted it,
but because my nerves required it. Since I was a judge's
wife, I couldn't be seen dropping into bars: I must carry
my own liquor. That day I bought small two-ounce medicine
bottles in the drug store, filled them with liquor,
and thereafter was never without a couple in my purse.


Soon I was slipping down doorways, vanishing into
ladies' rooms, anywhere I could gain privacy, to take a
swift drink to ward off the spells that came upon me with
increasing frequency. The two-ounce bottles graduated
to six-ounce, and then to a pint, and in the last years of
my marriage to the judge, wherever I went, I carried a
fifth of liquor in my bag.


“Lilly, darling, aren't you drinking too much?” my
mother worriedly asked one day. Neither she nor Ben
had any idea of how much I consumed daily; but they
knew of my nervous spells.


“Oh, Mom, I can stop when I want to,” I said irritably.
“When I have work to do, don't I do it? When I have to
run a charity affair, don't I handle it well? Don't I behave
all right in public?”


Once, driving down Tenth Avenue with my sister-in-law,
Estelle, I said, “I don't know why I'm so unhappy.

[p. <i>133</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“How can you cry carrying cake in both arms?” she
said, marvelling.


I went on the wagon. After all, I could stop drinking
when I wanted to. On the third day, I found myself
pacing back and forth in my apartment, crying out,
“Why am I so nervous?” I bit my lips until they bled,
trying to control my trembling body. “What is this?” I
asked, in desperation. “I haven't had anything to drink in
forty hours. What's happening to me? Maybe my mind's
giving way.” I threw myself into a chair and sat there,
shaking. My skin began to itch with crawling things that
weren't there. I struck at my body, my thighs, my legs.
I scratched until the blood came. I'm going mad, I
thought. I'm going to burst right open. I can't stand what
I'm going through. In desperation I hurled myself against
the spun-glass walls of our bedroom, raised my hands
high against the wall and slid them hard across it, lacerating
the palms, moaning with the pain. They oozed blood
in a hundred places. Maybe the hurt would drive away
the horror, the tingling, the panic, everything....


I gave in. I took the drink I didn't want to take.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XIII


THERE WERE some happy moments in the years with
Ben. One of the brightest was when I rented and furnished
a small apartment in the same building for my
mother, so that we could be near each other; another, to
see her joy when I surprised her on her birthday with a
$10,000 check for a trip to the French Riviera.


There was the thrill of returning to work in pictures.
I was offered a part in “Take a Chance,” the movie version
of a Broadway hit starring Ethel Merman. The film
was to be made in Astoria. Ben was doubtful about the
idea.


“You don't know what it will mean to me, Ben,” I
pleaded. “I simply have to do something. And you know
I never drink when I have things to do.”


He agreed. I worked in the picture with old friends--
Buddy Rogers, Jimmy Dunn, June Knight, Lillian Bond
and Cliff Edwards. My big song numbers--“Come Up
and See Me Sometimes” and “Eadie Was a Lady”--were
hits. When the film opened in Washington, D. C, I went
along to make a personal appearance, accompanied by
Katie.


For an entire week I was blissful. I drank nothing. I
was away from Ben, I was with my mother, and we loved
being together.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We returned to New York.


I let myself into our apartment. It was three p.m. I
sat down and waited for the judge. I glanced through my
mail, thumbed through a few magazines--and the old
nervousness possessed me. I had no desire to drink, but
I was bored, and I wanted to be gay and relaxed when
Ben arrived: I wanted his eyes to light up when he saw
me. I went into the bathroom and to the clothes hamper,
where I kept my own liquor. Ben, by now, was marking
off the amount remaining in our decanters on the sideboard,
to check how much I drank.


When he came in at 5:30, I was slumped in an easy
chair, glassy-eyed.


He stood over me. “Have you been like this all week?”


“Honest to God, Ben, ask my mother,” I said thickly.
“I only had a couple.”


He took me into his arms. “Why did you do it, Lillian?”


“I don't know,” I sobbed. “I don't know why I did it,
I won't do it again, I promise, I won't.”


“Maybe she ought to have something to occupy her
mind,” said Joe Shalleck, bringing home several law
books. “You've got a good brain, Lillian. There are only
a few women lawyers. If you were smart, you'd take up
law. With our help you'd finish high school and be practicing
law before you're thirty.”


“Why should she do that?” Ben asked. “She's a good
wife, she's a good hostess, and if she didn't drink so much,
she'd be a great help to me.”


At times Joe defended me. “Ben, she really hasn't had
time to sow her wild oats. That's why she drinks. If you'd
drink with her and get gay, that would help.”

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Ben tried.


“Lillian,” he would suggest, “let's not drink anything
until Saturday night. Then we'll drink and you can get
as high as you like.” Or, “Let's spend Thursday night
alone. We'll drink a whole bottle of sparkling Burgundy
together, just you and me.”


That sounded fair. “Isn't this nicer,” he would ask,
settling down in his easy chair with his glass of wine,
“than going out and causing talk by drinking too much?”


But Ben did not realize that I was tortured. The slow
drinking, the small amounts, only added fuel to the fire.
I needed more, my body needed more. I kept jumping
up, vanishing into the bathroom, taking a quick drink,
and running back to chase it down with wine.


Burgundy and Southern Comfort--to which I had now
switched--produce a startling effect when mixed. After
he finished his glass, Ben would look at me and exclaim,
“You see, Lillian, actually you can't drink. Two drinks
and you're woozy.”


He tried other strategy. When we were ready to retire,
he would say, “Would you like a little drink, baby, before
you go to bed?”


“I'd love it!” This was made to order for me. Now I
could drink all I wanted without worrying about the odor
of liquor on my breath.


We had a drink or two together. Between drinks, I
leaned over and kissed him. “Benjie, you're really sweet,”
I said. “Let's have a little music. Turn on the radio--I
feel like hearing Cab Calloway.”


We sat, drinking, leisurely listening to the music.


“Now, darling, you get ready for bed and I'll take a
quick shower,” I said. “I'll be out in a few minutes.”

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I vanished into the bathroom and reached for the
bottle, meanwhile turning on the shower full strength.


“Coming, dear?” This from the judge.


“Coming.”


The shower poured down, its steady thrum sounding a
pleasant background accompaniment as I finished my
bottle. Sometimes, in half an hour, I drank an entire fifth.


“What takes you so long, darling?”


“I'm making myself beautiful, Ben.” At the moment I
was rinsing my mouth with Chanel No. 5. It burned terribly,
but it made my lips smell sweet.


When I emerged, Ben threw aside his newspapers.
“You know,” he said, “you're not the most beautiful girl
in the world. You're not the most brilliant girl in the
world. But there must be something about you I like.
Do you know that?”


I laughed merrily, and ran to my husband.


Ben's routine when he returned from court in the afternoon
was always the same. He came in, hung up his coat
and hat, washed his hands, walked into the living room,
and kissed me. But some afternoons I drank: and when
he kissed me he knew it. Then he would walk away and
sit down, looking straight ahead.


Silence. I could not endure it.


“I'm sorry, Ben,” I would say abjectedly.


“All right. Let me know when dinner's ready.” He
buried his face in a newspaper.


He was silent through dinner and in silence we returned
to the living room. He sat down and again looked
straight ahead.


“Ben, I said I was sorry.”

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I know.”


“Why don't you talk to me?”


No answer.


“Oh, Ben, please, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
I'm just so nervous!”


Silence.


“Ben--let's go to a movie.”


Silence. Calmly he undressed, donned his robe,
brought out the bridge table, and began dealing himself
a game of solitaire.


“Benjie--” I ventured tentatively.


Still silence.


Then it would happen. My jangling nerves would explode.
“If this goes on I'll kill myself,” I'd scream. “I can't
stand it. I can't stand doing nothing. I'm going mad!”


One night I raced into the bathroom, tore open the
medicine cabinet, and swept an entire shelf of bottles
crashing to the tile floor.


No sound from Ben. I pushed open the bathroom door
and peeked out. Methodically he was playing his game,
placing a red ten on a black Jack.


I grabbed a bottle of iodine and lifted it to my lips.
“I'm dying,” I shrieked, “I'm dying.”


Iodine causes a purple froth at the mouth. Ben glanced
up, saw me, and quickly called the house physician. The
latter examined me. “Not much went down, did it?” he
asked, almost with a wink. I shook my head. “It burned
too much,” I whispered to him.


He told me to drink two glasses of milk and forget it.


The second time I did a better job. While Ben lay in
bed reading the <i>Daily News</i>--Columnist Ed Sullivan only
a few days earlier had written of the “radiantly happy

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You'll be sorry,” I gasped. “Oh, Ben!” I fell dramatically
to the floor at the entrance of the bedroom.


Ben continued reading. He did not even deign to look
up. I scrambled to my feet like a madwoman and rushed
at him, ripping off the covers and screaming, “You're a
brute. You have no heart. You don't care if I die!” I
worked myself into such a fit of hysterics that this time
he cradled me in his arms. “All right,” he said. “All right,
now.”


I wept. “I don't know why I do it, honest to God, Ben,
I don't know why I do it.”


I tried week-ending at milk farms. On one occasion
Milton's mother, Sandra, accompanied me, and we took a
room together. I tossed and turned all night.


“What is the matter, Lillian?” Mrs. Berle asked, time
and again.


“I'm all right,” I said. But I got out of bed and opened
the windows because I was hot, and then I was chilled
and got out of bed and closed them again.


In the morning the house physician dropped by. Mrs.
Berle, he said, was concerned about me. I was a sick girl,
she told him. How did I feel now?


“Really?” I said. By this time my jitters had gone. “I
had a restless night and so would you if you were as
darned hungry as I was. I'm fine.”


He looked at me for a moment, then leaned close. “If
I were you, Mrs. Shalleck, when you get back to town

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Oh, no,” I laughed. “I feel fine.”


As a matter of fact, by the time I returned to New
York, I felt fine. But when I came home, the judge was
not there. Once again I had to wait for him. I went into
the kitchen where my liquor was disguised in vinegar
bottles, and drank myself into helplessness.


Ben talked to me. “You're sick, Lillian. You must see
a doctor.” I agreed. The physician who examined me
minced few words. Unless I stopped drinking, he warned,
“you won't live another five years.”


“Oh, Doctor, that can't be,” I insisted. “I just drink to
soothe my nerves. I have no aches or pains. Besides, I can
always stop when I want to.”


Later I was taken to a second physician. “Judge, she's
a high-strung girl,” he said. “Temperamental. Not enough
to occupy her. Let her drink a few brandies now and
then. They'll relax her.”


I switched to brandy. The doctor had said a few, but I
overdid it. The brandy worked less quickly, yet it made
my heart thump and gave me a sense of impending
doom. I switched back to scotch, bourbon and gin.


Among the judge's friends, one of the most important
was Jimmy Hines, political leader of Ben's district, and
a power in Tammany Hall. I had heard of him, of course,
before I met Ben: I had agreed to appear at one of
Jimmy's benefits just before we were married. Later I
read in the newspapers charges that he was the “Tammany

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Once I went to him with word that the Charlanna
League had voted to appropriate money to be divided
among the needy who couldn't be helped by the city or
were too proud to accept relief. Could he give me a list
of those in his district? Or take the money and see that
it was properly distributed?


“You'll have to find them for yourself, Lillian,” he said.
“If I gave you a list or took the money, I might be accused
of using your group for my own political purposes,
and you'd be accused of abetting corruption!” He
laughed, but he did not give me a list.


The first time I actually heard Jimmy linked with
Schultz was one bad morning when I was struggling with
an agonizing hangover. The house phone rang. There
were police reporters in the lobby, and could they be sent
up?


For a moment I was more stunned than befuddled.
Police reporters? Had the doorman said “police reporters”
or “police and reporters?” What had I to do with the
police? Was this a hoax--someone trying to gain admittance?
Were they kidnappers who knew I had money?
Or holdup men? How could I escape, I thought frantically.
They would come up the front elevator--I might
flee down the service elevator ... if it happened to be
there when I dashed through the kitchen--

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On the other hand, if they were reporters, I had better
let them up and treat them nicely. The press was powerful.


My knees trembled, but I said with bravado, “Send
them up.” I'll give them a drink, I thought. Newspapermen
like to drink. And I gulped down a few, for courage.


The doorbell buzzed. My maid opened it, and suddenly
nearly a dozen reporters and photographers, waving
flashbulbs and cameras, were dashing into the room.


“Where is he?” one demanded excitedly.


“Who, the judge?” I stammered. I stood in the reception
hall, one arm braced against the door jamb, barring
them from the living room, like Jeanne Eagels in “The
Letter.”


“Look, Mrs. Shalleck,” one reporter snapped. “We
know he's here. Where's Dutch?”


For a moment the word didn't register. “Dutch? Dutch
who?” I pulled away from him, drawing the collar of my
dressing gown tight around my throat, tossing my head
defiantly, like Lenore Ulric in “Kiki.”


Another reporter said in a quieter voice, “Dutch
Schultz, Mrs. Shalleck. Didn't you read Winchell this
morning?”


He showed me the clipping. Walter had asked: “What
two brothers, legalites, and the show girl spouse of one
of them are hiding Dutch Schultz in their penthouse
apartment on 86th Street?”


I became panicky. Two brothers? Legalites? 86th
Street penthouse apartment? It all added up. Joe, a
criminal lawyer, might defend people like Schultz. But
Ben--how was he involved? And would he hide anyone
like Dutch Schultz in our home?

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I telephoned the judge while the reporters rummaged
through the apartment. Ben talked to some of them on
the phone. He told me later that he threatened libel suits
if they connected the Shallecks any way with Schultz in
print.


After they left I was a bundle of nerves. I could picture
all New York and Hollywood talking about Lillian Roth
hiding a gangster in her apartment.


The afternoon papers cleared it up. The showgirl
whose picture appeared on page one wasn't Lillian Roth,
but Hope Dare, who lived in a penthouse on <i>East</i> 86th
Street. Ours was <i>West</i> 86th Street. One of the lawyers
Winchell had in mind was Dixie Davis, Hope Dare's boy
friend. The Shallecks were innocent.


Ben got home as early as he could. “What better reason
could a woman in my position have to take a drink or
two?” I cried. “I had to take it for my nerves.”


Rabbi and Mrs. Stephen Wise, whom I had met
through the Charlanna League, knew how much I
wanted a baby. They called to tell us about a beautiful
five-month-old baby girl, now in England, whose parents
had died in Hitler's concentration camps. Mrs. Wise later
showed me a photograph, and I fell in love with the little
girl. “If I could only adopt her,” I said. “I'd give her so
much love--”


Mrs. Wise put her arm around my shoulder. “We'll
try,” she said. “Perhaps we can make arrangements to
bring the child over for you.”


I was ecstatic. This was the answer: this would solve
everything.


In gratitude I threw an enormous “Drop In” party,

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The party was a brilliant success. Food came from
Reuben's and Lindy's and Dave's Blue Room; liquor from
the White Horse and King's Ransom people and Jack and
Charlie of “21.” We received millinery, bags, shoes and
gowns from Milgrim's and other stores, and raffled them
off. Sherman Billingsley brought some Stork Club regulars,
and the guests were a rollcall of Broadway's best-known
personalities. I raised more than $5,000.


Mrs. Wise kissed me. “I never dreamed that a little
girl like you would be able to do all this in one afternoon!”


Late that night Charlotte and Harry Ritz, who were
leaving next morning for California to fill a picture contract,
sat up with us far into the small hours, helping us
celebrate. I had made the Wises happy, Katie was happy,
Ben was happy. Regina was on her way.


“There's only one thing that I'm concerned about,” I
said to Charlotte, as we sat about our little dinette. “Mrs.
Wise tells me it may be four or five months before the
baby comes over. What will I do with myself until then?”


Charlotte was describing the house they had rented in
California. “What time does your train leave?” I asked
idly.


Harry looked at his wristwatch. “Nine a.m.--five hours
from now.”

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You know,” I said dreamily, “I have a yen to get on
that train with you. Everytime I hear a train whistle, I
get an eerie, empty feeling--I want to go someplace, I
don't know where--”


“Well, why don't you?” Harry spoke up. “Come along
with us.”


“Yes, why don't you?” Ben echoed. “You've been working
hard. Katie and I will join you out there when my
vacation begins. And if Regina arrives before then, we'll
send for you.”


Without any great certainty as to what I felt in my
heart, I began packing. Dawn was breaking. To be sure
of whatever it was I wanted to be sure of, I tucked away
five bottles of rye whiskey among my clothes.


I did not know it, but my six unfulfilled years with Ben
were coming to an end--empty witness to what might
have been.

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XIV


ALL MY HOPES lay in Regina. I marked time, and
marking time was intolerable without drinking. And I
told myself that I could always stop when Regina came.


A letter arrived from Ben. Something had gone wrong.
Our little orphan wasn't coming to America after all.
But he and Katie would be with me in six weeks.


The news was like a physical blow. I had counted so
much on the baby! That night the Ritzes, knowing my
dejection, took me to a club party. Brought to our table
by mutual friends was a man, perhaps ten years older
than I, who was introduced to me as Art. Art looked a
little like Bing Crosby, and a little like my father--blue-eyed,
light brown hair, an engaging grin. He had a dry
sense of humor.


“Do we have to stay at this party?” he asked after a
while. “Let's take a little drive around.”


Harry and Charlotte didn't mind. Perhaps they understood
better than I knew at what loose ends I was. “We're
just a bunch of old married couples,” Harry said. “You
go ahead and have some fun.”


We drove to an all-night bar, where Art quietly
matched my bourbon and water with ginger ales. “Don't

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I know what you mean,” I said. Here was a kindred
soul. I grew to know him better in the days that followed.
We spoke the same language. He seemed to enjoy my
company, and I--I found it easy to relax with him. Thus
I rationalized the fact that I enjoyed parties, nightclubs,
prize fights and long drives with him. He was morose
more often than not, but I could cheer him up: he leaned
on me, and that gave me strength.


Things began to look up a bit. I got an offer to appear
at the Trocadero, one of Hollywood's smartest nightclubs,
and Art helped me pull myself together.


I took a lovely suite nearby. The morning after my
opening M-G-M phoned me. They wanted to test me for
a part. Perhaps I would be launched on another picture
career and forget the loss of Regina.


Ben wired me the night before he and Katie arrived.
I telephoned Art. “It will have to be goodbye,” I said.
“You were wonderful to me when I needed a friend--
but I'm awfully fond of you, and that isn't good. It would
be better if I don't see you again.”


He took it philosophically. “Anything you say,” he said.
“But I'll be around town.”


That night I went to Lita Chaplin's home and began
to drink. At midnight I drove to my apartment. Once
inside, I felt utterly dejected. There was no Regina, no
Art. And I had to face the judge and Mother in a few
hours.


When Katie and Ben arrived at three a.m., they found
me on the couch. They shook me. I managed to say

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“There's just nothing that can be done with this girl,”
the judge was saying. “What are we going to do, Katie?”


And my mother's despairing voice: “I don't know
what's gotten into Lilly. She's such a good girl, Ben; she
must be sick.”


Miserable days followed. As usual Ben wanted to do
nothing. He refused to play golf; neither did he wish to
go swimming, or play tennis, or go nightclubbing, or do
anything but join Katie in gin-rummy--and read his newspapers.


I found myself turning again to Art for comfort. I
could face him being myself, without a sense of guilt or
incompetence. Art was anything but suave and dapper:
I discovered now that he belonged to the betting world,
about which I knew little. He can't quote Gladstone, and
Roosevelt never congratulated him, I thought, but he can
cheer me up.


Finally I spoke to Ben, “I can't go back to New York
with you. My future is here. M-G-M wants to test me. I
must try my career again. I just can't go back to New
York and that empty life. ... Ben, without the child
there's nothing. Let's face it.”


“Maybe you're right, Lillian,” he said. “But you've been
drinking. Sleep on it, and we'll talk it over tomorrow.”


Next morning I felt the same. I tripled my pre-breakfast
drink to give me courage to tell Ben I had to go
through with my plans. We had words and at one point
Ben, pale with anger, approached me. I stumbled and fell
down a flight of stairs just as my mother appeared.

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the Katie of old who raged at Ben. “That's no
way to treat my daughter, drinking or not drinking,” she
shouted. “You know she hasn't any balance when she's
like that. She could have killed herself.”


Ben apologized. “It was an accident,” he protested. I
was in a red haze of fury as I got to my feet.


“Last night you agreed with me. I'm not so drunk I
don't remember. Now you can get out. You haven't supported
me, you haven't done one thing for me. I loaned
you money, when you needed it, I don't owe you anything.
You can get out--and get out this afternoon!”


After he left I paced the room. What had I done now?
It helped matters little that Art met me an hour later at
a bar. I expected him to comment on the news of my
breakup, but he was silent.


In the next few weeks we drank together and Art began
to show a different side. “You've got to control your
liquor,” he said unexpectedly one night, and there was a
flicker of disgust in his eyes. For a moment I had a sinking
feeling in my stomach.


“All right, I'll try,” I promised. And since he was so
interested, would he tell me what all this led to? We
were seeing a great deal of each other. Was he going to
marry me?


“Look, kid,” he said, “you're not even divorced yet.”


“If I knew we were going to be married, I'd go to New
York and make arrangements.”


He thought that over for a moment. “If you don't know
what you want, why don't you traipse back to the
judge?”


That shocked me into two days of sobriety. Then Katie

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Art walked in one night, his mood sullen. “Still drinking,
eh? If you want to see what drinking is, I'll show
you.” He brought out three bottles of bourbon and began
to drink steadily. “You know what you are,” he said
suddenly. “You're a no-good bum!” He began to slap me.
I broke away, only to have him put out his foot and trip
me. I scrambled to my feet and managed to make the
door. “Ill show you what liquor is--” he flung after me.


I was frightened. Never had a man treated me like this
before. I tried to explain away the episode. Hadn't he
warned me how liquor affected him? I wasn't so charming
when I drank, either. When he met me again, one
night, at the Clover Club bar, I attempted a middle
course. “Just one bourbon, Art,” I said, as I slid onto a
stool next to him. “That's my limit tonight.”


He guffawed, and I knew he had been drinking. “Set
up ten in a row here,” he ordered the bartender, then
turned to me. “Show the customers, Lillian. Drink 'em all.
You know you can do it.”


Rather than create a scene, I downed five in succession.
Later, at the bar, as I clung to him glassy-eyed, he suddenly
shoved me away. “You're a bum,” he said thickly.
“Why don't you go back to New York? I'm sick of looking
at your face.” He reeled away.


Next day I called the William Morris agency. Could
they book me in the East? At once? The answer was yes
--Billy Rose's Casa Manana, in New York.


Something of my old gaiety returned with my name in

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Do you recall meeting me, Miss Roth?”


Vaguely I remembered him. I had met him once with
the judge, hadn't I? That was right. Was I busy this
evening? If not, would I like to go places and have fun,
all around town?


Why not? I thought. We made the rounds: the Stork
Club, “21,” El Morocco, Toots Shor, the Plaza. He telephoned
me every day. He called for me every evening.
The New York World's Fair of 1939 was in full swing
at Flushing Meadows, and Mark was engaged in public
relations there. He was delightful company. He knew
how to order correctly at the best restaurants, insisted
upon the proper wine with each course, and never failed
to send orchids. He was solicitous: gallantly he opened
doors, pulled out chairs, made sure I wasn't sitting in a
draft, saw to it that I received the best of everything.
He was ardent and masterful; and at the end of a week,
he told me he was madly in love with me.


As I considered this, my dressing room telephone rang.
It was the judge. He invited me to go to dinner, one
evening, and I accepted. Later, in my apartment, he told
me he was glad to see that I had calmed down. Hollywood,
he went on, was no place for me. I belonged here,
in New York. So saying, he became amorous.


“If that's the way you feel,” I said, repentant, “perhaps

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But Ben wasn't prepared to make it official again. He
suggested that we could, however, see each other often,
as if nothing had happened. He was ready to take a little
house for me in Long Island. ...


I exploded. “I was your wife! Do you think I'd become
your mistress?” I screamed, and pushed him away. I
downed a drink of bourbon, and then another ... I
blacked out. When I woke, it was morning. The aroma
of Ben's cigar was still in the room.


The days that followed were chaotic. Art began to
call me from the coast. Would I accept his abject apologies?
He'd warned me he was ugly when he drank. He
missed me terribly: I must come back to him.


Now it became impossible for me to cope with the
situation. Mark telephoned me at all hours trying to persuade
me to marry him. The judge upbraided me for
ruining our marriage, yet refused to take me back as his
wife. Art telephoned from the coast, pleading with me
to return. I was confused, my life upset and bewildering.
There was only liquor to help me escape trying to think
at all. Finally, in my fourth and last week at the Casa
Manana, although I pulled myself together for my act,
I was in agony in the finale, because the alcohol had
worn off and I needed more. My jaws stiffened, perspiration
dripped from me, my voice faded to a whisper.


“I don't understand it,” Billy Rose said. “Something
must have happened, Lillian. You've been doing such a
swell job--”


I barely made it through the last days, and when the
show closed, I collapsed.

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Katie was frightened as never before, and watched
apprehensively as the doctor examined me. He gave his
verdict. “Young lady, you need at least a six months' rest.”


“You mean a ranch?” I asked, weakly.


“No. I mean a quiet sanitarium where you won't
drink.”


“Me, away for six months?” I cried out. Katie held my
hand. “I won't make you go, Lilly. Don't worry, baby,
I'll take care of you myself.”


But I wouldn't let her. She had suffered enough. Instead,
I hired a nurse and rented a cottage in the country.
My nurse gave me the salt-water cure, which causes
a revulsion toward alcohol. She dosed me with salt-water
at every meal: it made me so ill I retched constantly.
“I'm carrying out the doctor's orders, dear,” she said. “I'm
not taking any liquor away from you.” She left a fifth of
rye near my bed. When I tried to take a drink to halt my
shakes, the nausea and cramps were excruciating. It was
unbearable.


“Call Mr. Harris,” I begged her. “I want to go back to
town. Tell him we're flying back.”


The Newark Airport was a sea of fire when Mark and
my nurse helped me off the plane. I was a sight. I was
bloated. I bore the marks of the mental anguish of the
last few weeks, and I shook uncontrollably. “Good Lord!”
exclaimed Mark. “You look awful--what happened to
you?”


The nurse smiled thinly. “She doesn't like to drink any
more, do you, Lillian?”


I could only glare weakly at her.


“Don't worry,” said Mark. “Everything will be all

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A few minutes later the desk clerk called up. “If you're
taking the room by the month, you'll have to pay in advance.”


“Didn't a man just come down and pay you?” I asked,
bewildered.


No one had paid the bill.


I was distraught. I dismissed my nurse and telephoned
Evie Jabon, a girl friend, to come over. By the time she
arrived I was in a state of collapse. “Kiddo, you need a
drink,” she said, and ordered a bottle of rye. A few
drinks calmed me down, and we managed to get into a
cab and move to the Hotel Delmonico, where I was
known.


Mark telephoned an hour later.


“I just thought of something I had to do when I left
you,” he said. “Then I went back and you were gone.
I'll be right over.”


I was confused. He didn't offer to return the money.
In the next week I wrote checks constantly. I was under
medical care, given vitamin injections, fruit juices,
bromides, sleeping pills.


A new doctor came on the case. The dope and medication
had taken their toll: I lay in a half-stupor. We were
alone. He approached my bed and bent over me: I felt
his warm hands on my body. I tried to protest, but the
words would not come. He began caressing me, and suddenly
my arms were pinned. It was a nightmare, in which
I struggled wildly but my limbs were powerless: I

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Mark arrived later, I had come out of my stupor,
but I knew what had happened. The doctor was gone.
For the first time in my life I had been completely incapable
of taking care of myself. I stammered out the
story.


Mark looked at me incredulously. “Are you trying to
tell me that he attacked you?”


“Yes,” I moaned. “Yes.”


Mark did not believe me.


“Ask him,” I wept. “See what he says.”


Mark returned later. “Lillian, you must have had a
hallucination from the drugs,” he said, soothingly. “I
spoke to him in his office, face to face. He was stunned
when I told him.”


What can I do, I sobbed to myself. Nobody will believe
me.


Two days later the doctor entered my room. I shrieked,
“What are you doing here? Get out--”


“You're ill, Miss Roth,” he said blandly.


“Get out!” I screamed at the top of my voice.


He got out.


Six months passed in a blur. Mark helped me prepare
a statement to the press about my divorce from Ben.
It read well:


I've been on the stage since I was a child. It's part of me and
all my friends are stage people. I love parties--the kind that
last until the small hours. However, it's different with my husband.
He has to have sleep and a clear mind for his work in
court. We had a long talk the other day and decided things
just wouldn't work out. I still think he's a wonderful man.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For the rest, it was like a bad dream with vaguely
familiar characters: Mark, my mother, myself. I remember
day-long vigils in bars, driving a car eighty miles an
hour through Long Island, plowing speedboats through
Hell's Gate at fearful speeds on stormy nights, my mother
crying as I drank and Mark drank with me.


In my lucid moments Katie warned me. “He's borrowing
twenties and fifties from you. It will be thousands
later. I know his type.”


What difference did it make? I thought. Mark and I
had something in common. We suffered the same weakness,
the same agony: he could drink with me. We inhabited
our private universe which others might not
understand. I didn't love him, but who knew what love
was, anymore? And who cared?


I had missed the newspaper stories about Mark--about
his habitual drunkenness, his criminal record. He'd had
several federal indictments, usually on confidence matters.
At the time I met him he was out on bail on a charge
for which he had been arrested a few months before. No
one volunteered to tell me, but there was plenty to be
learned about Mark's past.


He did tell me that he had a nine-year-old son by a
previous marriage. The child was in boarding school. I
saw Sonny once--blue-eyed, blond-haired, helpless and
lonely.


I fell in love with the idea of caring for him. I thought,
this is what I need. At last, a child to mother!

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XV


IT STARTED in the Glass Hat on Lexington Avenue, where
we ordered dinner. The date was January 22, 1940. The
world outside was in turmoil. Hitler's armies were rolling
across Europe, and violence raged over thousands of
miles of earth. But Mark and I were working out, in our
own tiny way, our salvation. We had been on the wagon
for two weeks, each sustaining the other. For the first
time in a long time tomorrow was beginning to promise
a little more than yesterday.


Mark leaned across the table and said, “Mommy”--his
pet name for me--“we've been so good, let's just have one
little martini before dinner.”


One couldn't hurt. Neither could a second, particularly
since we firmly stopped at that. We smiled at each other
over our glasses. We were proud of ourselves. Alcohol
was our worst enemy, and at last we were doing something
about it. And we got along well. “Why don't we
get married?” Mark asked. “Maybe we will,” I replied.
“Let's start a brand new life together,” he said--“you and
I and Sonny.”


“Maybe we will,” I repeated. It was an attractive picture.
My divorce from the judge, obtained on grounds of
mental cruelty, had become final months earlier. I put

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mark was carrying out his part. He was to leave early
tomorrow for Detroit where, he said, he had an important
war contract on tap. He was short of money, he remarked
as we strolled to my apartment after dinner. Could I
spare a little cash? I gave him $90 for his fare, and a
check for $500 for expenses. Then we relaxed with a
quiet game of Klabyash.


About nine o'clock, feeling hot and tired, I decided
I'd take a shower. Then we would play one more hand,
and he would go home and get a good night's sleep in
preparation for his journey.


I came out of my room to find him slumped on the
couch with a silly grin on his face. A quick glance into
the kitchenette told me what had happened. He had
consumed a fifth of gin in twenty minutes!


I stood over him, almost beside myself with disappointment
and anger. How could I stay sober if I couldn't
count on him? What a mockery the picture he had painted--Mark
and me and Sonny! Anger rose in me. “Get
out!” I suddenly screamed. “You can't be trusted--get
out of here. I don't want a drunken bum staying in my
apartment all night. Get out! My mother was right--”
I pulled at him.


He rose swayingly and took a step forward. Suddenly
his fist exploded in my face. My head rocked and I felt a
sharp stab of pain; a pinwheel of flame whirled in my
eyes.


Next thing I knew I was lying on the bed. There was
blood over me and the bed, and the wall was splashed

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The telephone rang. I looked about, dazed. Mark answered,
his voice smooth as butter. “Hello, Linda. She's
fine, thanks. Yes, we'll try to make it.”


I was half conscious, my face numb. “Your jaw is
broken,” the doctor was saying. I sat in his office for
hours until he completed wiring my jaw. “You won't be
able to open your mouth for six weeks,” he said. “You'll
have to live on liquids.”


The next days were an unreal phantasmagoria. Ruth
Bernstein and her husband, Bernie, found me in my apartment,
passed out. I had been drinking steadily for five
days. She took me to the hospital, where I was fed
through a tube. The doctor had had to give me whiskey:
“If you take that from me I'll go stark raving mad!” He
said, “Let her have it. She must have something for the
pain--either dope or liquor. The liquor won't kill her.”


It was ten days before Winchell had the scoop, just
a line--“What playboy broke Lillian Roth's jaw?” It was
sufficient. My name was splashed over all the newspapers.
Lillian Roth, the playgirl, beaten up at a wild
party. With my wired jaw I got on the phone and painfully
tried to reach Walter in Florida, to tell him this
was no playboy-playgirl episode.


Katie was with me now, heartbroken. “Lilly, what are
you doing with your life!” My father flew in from Boston.
“Baby, you're messing yourself all up! If I get my hands
on that bastard--” My sister Ann lamented, “Oh, Lillian,
you're getting to be a girl people talk about.”


I returned to my hotel and waited. Orchids arrived--

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Accompanied by two detectives, I waited in the lobby
of the hotel, on the chance that Mark would come there.
I was right. He walked in and I pointed: “That's him,”
I said. The detectives arrested him. Jailed on a charge of
assault, Mark was out next day on $1500 bail. That afternoon
his attorney pleaded with me. If Mark's disgrace
became known, Sonny would be expelled from school.
Mark himself was prostrate: if I would only see him so
he could ask my forgiveness. ...


“All right,” I said, wearily. “I'll see him.”


Carrying a box of roses, his eyes red-rimmed, Mark
visited me. “I didn't mean it, Mommy, I swear to God I
didn't.” He began to cry. “You know I wouldn't hurt you
intentionally. I don't know what comes over me when
I'm drinking. My God, how many fighters have been hit,
over and over again, and never a broken jaw! I didn't
know what I was doing. I blacked out. ...”


So he went on. Why would he do it when he adored
me, when his son wanted me for his mother?


I wished desperately to believe him. Was it impossible
for me to get along with anyone? And why should Mark
set out to harm me? I <i>had</i> been good to him. Thus I
reasoned. And having pleaded his case well, he disappeared
again.

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My lawyer asked for a closed court session when the
assault case came up, on the theory that it had embarrassing
boudoir overtones. I was assured that his request
had been granted. But when I arrived the day of the
trial, I learned that it was to be an open hearing before
three justices.


I was furious, and the bourbon I had taken to fortify
me for my ordeal did little to help. “You're not going to
disgrace me!” I shouted at the judges. “I refuse to testify
in front of all these people.”


I began to walk out. A court attendant seized my arm
and deftly brought me around until I was in front of the
bench again. “You're supposed to protect innocent
women,” I stormed. “Is this the way you do it? I know
what goes on behind those black robes!”


The presiding justice snapped:


“That's insolence. You say any more and I'll hold you
in contempt. Sit down.”


I sat down. My attorney pleaded for a private hearing.
The court refused. Instead, the case was postponed. The
presiding justice gave me a parting lecture:


“I would probably send you to jail for your unwarranted
outburst, Miss Roth, if I did not take into consideration
that you are a very nervous, high-strung person
and temporarily out of your mind.”


I thought, it's as good a diagnosis as any.


The case dragged on for months. I stubbornly persisted
in my inability, brought on by fear of newspaper headlines,
to remember that Mark came to my apartment and
broke my jaw. If it had happened on a street corner,
there would have been no difficulties.


Ultimately the charges were dropped, and I went to

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was going downgrade. I had gained weight. I acted
like a lush, and I looked like a drunk, and my comings
and goings in public places were marked by nudgings
and whisperings.


Mark came on from New York, ostensibly to see Sonny,
who during the trial had been sent to live with an uncle
in Chicago. He dropped in to see me at the club one
night. Again, he was the persuasive wooer. Could I never
forget one unfortunate, drunken blow? “Can you throw
away the rest of your life, and my life, because of one
blow? I love you, Mommy,” he said. “I adore you. You
know it.”


I was sick, I was heartbroken, I was ashamed, I was
alone. Who offered me more? “All right, Mark,” I said.
“Let's try.”


He was insanely jealous. One evening when he found
me chatting and laughing with a patron of the club, he
threatened my life. He made an ugly scene. On another
occasion he lunged at me. “Don't you fool around with
anyone else,” he roared.


On closing night I called my personal maid, Elizabeth.
“I'm afraid of him,” I told her. “I want to get out of town
without his knowledge. Will you help me?”

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Yes, ma'am. I'll go home and pack for you.”


“We can't go to a hotel. He'll find us.”


“Don't you worry, Miss Lillian,” she said. “Safest place
is with my family. My father's a preacher and my
mother's a school teacher. You come with me tonight.”
She took me to spend the night in her home in Chicago's
Harlem. To think this was my only haven: thank God, I
thought, for these sweet colored people. He'd never dream
of looking for me here. For the first time in years I felt
like a child cared for by tender parents. The apartment
boasted two large beds, one in the kitchen, the other in
the bedroom. Her father said, “You'll feel better in the
kitchen bed because it's more homelike.” And there I
slept.


In the morning I had to have my drink, and they managed
to make me eat some breakfast. What now? Where
could I hide? We devised our plan. Lita Gray Chaplin,
my good friend, lived in Balboa, California. Elizabeth
and her husband would drive me there, and take care of
me until I got hold of myself. I wired Lita, and sent
Elizabeth to my hotel to gather up my things.


She had packed half my clothes when Mark, who apparently
had been searching for me, strode through the
open door. He ripped one bag out of her hands and began
pummeling her. “You get nothing from me,” she
shouted, holding grimly to my overnight bag and striking
back with her other hand. “Miss Lillian's afraid to call
the police but I got nothing to lose.”


When she arrived, she reported: “He begged me to
tell you he loves you, but, ma'am, I wouldn't believe his
sweet talk.”


We left the next day. I lay in the back of my car, a

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Lita paled when she saw me. “Lillian!” she exclaimed,
horrified, “we've got to put you to bed!” They carried me
into her house and her physician cared for me. I collapsed
completely. Years later she told me she was almost
shocked dumb by my appearance. My face was purple,
my eyes all but lost in the midst of two ghastly white
circles, my cheeks were networks of broken blood vessels,
I was more than twenty pounds overweight, my stomach
was swollen from lack of food. I suffered something akin
to beri-beri. After all, I had lived on liquor during the
entire trip.


When I began to recuperate, Lita rented a little house
for me on the island, and Elizabeth and her husband remained
to take care of me.


Ten days later I was brooding over a scotch in my
living room when a sound made me look up. My heart
almost stopped.


There was Mark walking soberly in the doorway, and
there was Sonny, running to me, throwing his arms
around me and crying, “Mommy!”

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“How are you, Mommy?” said Mark gently, bending
down and kissing me on the cheek.


My mind formed the words, “Oh God, what's the use!”
I could not fight it anymore. I had been buffeted about
too much. Sonny sat on my lap, prattling away, and Mark
was on his knees, his arms around me, saying brokenly,
“I don't know, Mommy, I don't know, believe me when
we're married it will be different. We need you, darling,
we both need you more than we know ourselves.”


He had found me simply enough. I hadn't packed the
brace I had worn on my teeth at night after Mark broke
my jaw. He found it, concluded rightly that I would
wire my dentist to forward another, and so learned where
I had fled.


Whether because of my weakened condition, or my
liquor-fogged brain, or the conviction that it was fated to
be, I do not know--but Mark and I went before a judge,
and we were married.


The reporters and photographers came en masse to the
apartment we rented in Beverly Hills. Pictures were
taken: Mark, sweet and protective, sitting with his arm
around me, Sonny playing happily at our feet. The headline
writers made a day of it. “LOVE LAUGHS AT
BROKEN JAW;” “LILLIAN ROTH SOCK LEADS TO
ALTAR;” “LILLIAN ROTH WEDS JAW-BUSTER.”


That afternoon several men came to talk business with
Mark. He took me aside. “Mommy, have you about
$20,000 that we can get right away?”


I said no. All I had now were my policies and bonds.


“Well, Mommy, you want us to start off right, don't
you? These men have a terrific deal.” He explained that
he could buy into Joan Blondell Cosmetics, a legitimate

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Next day I went out and borrowed the money on my
policies.


Sonny became the focus of my life. He came to me one
day and spoke with an earnestness that tore at my heart.
“Was my mother a bad mother like my daddy says?” I
put my arms around him and kissed him. “Your daddy
must have made a mistake,” I said. “He wasn't feeling
good when he told you that. I saw pictures of your
mother. She had blonde hair and blue eyes like you, and
she's watching you now and she's so glad you have someone
to take care of you.” I added: “She's really your
mother. I'm just Mommy. But let's not tell daddy anything
about this.”


We had wonderful afternoons together. It was great
fun to bring him games and books, and to take him to
the movies. Perhaps, I thought, this little boy will make
something of my life. Maybe through him I will become
a different woman, and Mark a different man.


My only solace was Sonny--and liquor. There was always
a bottle in my medicine cabinet and under my
mattress. I tried not to let Sonny see me drink. But I had
to have liquor to stop my screaming nerves, my exploding
brain, to dull the knifelike certainty that I was going
nowhere, doing nothing, living as a shadow in an empty
world.


I never fooled Sonny. For when he would find me in
one of my nervous fits, or weeping, he would say. “Don't
you need some of Daddy's medicine?”


Nothing changed. Mark was charming one moment,

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He asked for money. “Mommy,” he would say, “we
need $5,000 more.” “But, Mark, I just cashed in a bond
last week,” I would protest. “I thought that was all you
needed. I'm going into my life insurance now.”


“All right, baby, let's forget it,” he would say. “How
about a couple of drinks?” We began to drink--drinks
I didn't need. When I was all but passed out, he would
say, “Oh, Mommy, there's something I forgot. Here's
some papers to sign.”


Even in my blurred state I knew what was happening.
I thought, he's quiet now, and easy, but if I say no ...
You better sign it, I would tell myself, or you'll get what
you got last time when he went into one of those maniacal
rages and took Sonny from you.


He had grabbed Sonny and vanished with him for two
days. When he returned, the child was trembling with
fear.


I thought, “Oh, God, all right,” and signed. Later I
learned I had signed away my insurance policies to
strangers whom Mark had made my beneficiaries in return
for cash.


One night we had a ringside table with Lita Chaplin
and her husband, Arthur Day, at Grace Hayes' Lodge.
The floor show started just as the waiter was serving our
dinner. The entertainers were Peter Lind Hayes and his
wife, Mary Healy. In show business it's customary to

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Eat,” said Mark, when I made no move toward my
food. He grabbed my wrist.


“Sh-sh-sh--I want to hear them,” I said. “Professional
courtesy.” He'll be all right, I thought. He won't dare
cause a scene, not with Lita and Arthur sitting there.
“I'll eat in a little while,” I said.


“Listen, Bum,” he shouted, “if you don't have that
plate empty by the time I count ten it's going into your
face!”


I laughed nervously and took one bite, and turned my
face to the stage again. Suddenly I felt the blow of the
plate in my face--food splattered over me and slid into
my lap. The plate had hit me on the bridge of the nose.
Blood gushed forth. Waiters came running and the table
overturned as Lita's husband rose and grabbed Mark. I
found myself running outside, and then I was in a cab,
headed for home, the blood thudding at my temples.


I had no key. There was nothing to do but wait in the
hallway until Mark came home. He found me sitting on
the floor, propped against the door of the apartment.


He jerked me to my feet. “Come on,” he said roughly.
“We're going nightclubbing.”


I stared dazedly at him. “The way I look?” I faltered.


“The way you look,” he said. “Let 'm all see what a
bum I've got to live with.”


With my blood-spattered dress, my lacerated face, my
dishevelled hair, he forced me to accompany him to one
club, then another. People saw me, and gasped. I was
like an automaton, without will, without hope. Here you
are, I thought dully, once famous, now infamous, living
with a paranoiac. You can't go lower.

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The day came when he beat Sonny in my presence.
What I could not do for myself, I found courage to do
for Sonny. I packed a bag and took him with me to a
neighboring hotel. “Please,” I begged the night clerk,
slipping a $10 bill into his hand, “don't let Mr. Harris
know we are here. We must get some sleep. My little boy
is a nervous wreck.”


During the night a bellboy rang. “Your husband is
coming up the service stairs.” Mark had found me by
bribing the night clerk who had taken my money and,
as I learned later, considered me a hopeless drunk.


I raced with Sonny down another flight of stairs and
took a cab to a second hotel. There at eleven a.m. Mark's
lawyer reached me. “I'm afraid you'll have to bring the
boy back. Otherwise, your husband will swear out a
warrant for kidnapping.”


“Promise you'll be there so he won't touch us,” I
begged. I need not worry, he said. Twenty minutes later
I entered my apartment, Sonny clutching my hand. A
case of liquor had been opened and bottles were strewn
about. Mark, waiting for me, had been entertaining two
men. The lawyer wasn't there.


He jumped up, swept Sonny off the floor and all but
tossed him into the bedroom. Then he began shaking me,
roaring at the others, “Get out, I'll take care of this bitch,
stealing my son!” I screamed at the men, “Don't go--”
but the door was already closing behind them. In the
bedroom Sonny whimpered, “Don't hurt her, Daddy, she
was only taking care of me.”


I tried to make the door but Mark was quicker. He
kicked it shut and began punching me, slapping my face
with his open hand, muttering hoarsely, “Make a fool out

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then I was running screaming through the streets,
blood blinding my eyes. Next thing I knew I was in St.
Vincent's Hospital. Dr. Francis Thomas, a surgeon, was
stitching my scalp.


I signed a warrant for Mark's arrest, Dr. Thomas giving
his testimony to the police. Amy Ford, a friend, rented
a room for me in her hotel. For two days I was afraid to
show myself on the streets. I hid behind drawn blinds,
drinking, afraid to think, drinking to blot out what had
happened to me. On the third morning there was the
sound of a huge body hurled against the door, a thunderous
crash as it broke down--and Mark was in the same
room with me.


He was cold fury. “You're sitting down and writing the
District Attorney that you were dead drunk when you
signed that warrant. You want to withdraw the charges
and tear up the warrant.”


I sat, transfixed with fear. Suddenly he grabbed my
arm, and with all his 210 pounds bearing down on me,
twisted me to my knees. I couldn't scream because his
free hand was clasped over my mouth.


“I'll kill you,” he said between his teeth. He increased
the pressure on my arm. “Will you write the letter?”


In agony I tried to gasp “yes.” I managed to nod, and
slowly, he let me up.


The District Attorney called us both in, together and

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Mrs. Harris,” the District Attorney said to me, slowly.
“I must warn you. I hope what you are now stating to me
is the truth. Because if you keep withdrawing these
charges, when the day comes that you really need help,
you'll not be safe in any state in this country. The record
you have made will count against you.”


I clung to my story. I was telling the truth. How did I
explain the bruises? I fell down. My balance, as they well
knew, was sometimes precarious. And the weird, patched
hair-do, the result of Dr. Thomas' stitches? A beauty operator
had burned me with a permanent wave machine,
I said.


What does it all matter, I thought. I deserve no better
than Mark. He is the measure of what I have become.

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XVI


I WAS too helpless to think of a way out immediately
for myself. But something had to be done about Sonny.
One day he proudly began to show how he had been
taught as a Boy Scout to make his bunk. Unpredictably,
this infuriated Mark. He pulled the boy away from the
bed so violently that the child fell. “You don't make it
that way, Sonny,” he snarled. “You make it this way. And
you know why? Because <i>I</i> say you make it this way.”


Again, when I took the child to a movie and returned
twenty minutes late, Mark, drunk as usual, grabbed me
by the hair and pulled me down to my knees.


“Ever see a bum, Sonny?” he sneered. “This is what a
bum looks like.” Sonny stood paralyzed with fright.


I waited until Mark was mellow with brandy one afternoon.


Then I suggested, “Let's send Sonny to a boarding
school where he'll get the training he needs. You want
him to have that big physique you have, don't you? He'll
get it there.”


Mark agreed. I enrolled Sonny in a nearby military
school. It was lonely without him, but at least I would
see him week ends. But soon I was deprived even of
that. Mark started meeting his son Friday afternoons and

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I persisted in my questions, Mark grew ugly. He
had been drinking a great deal. One night I awoke
screaming. He was beating me. A vise of excruciating
pain gripped my chest, and I blacked out. Sometime during
the morning I was speaking weakly on the telephone
to Dr. Thomas, begging him to come over. Every breath
seared my lungs: I was breathing fire.


“You have five broken ribs,” he said, after he examined
me. “I wasn't drunk, Doctor,” I moaned. “He started it
while I was asleep. He beat me unconscious while I was
sleeping.”


“Lillian,” Dr. Thomas said quietly. “You must do something
or sooner or later this maniac will kill you.”


When he left, I thought, as well as I could think: what
was there to do? I was not even safe with the police.
Hadn't I signed a warrant, hadn't a doctor given evidence--and
look what had happened. There was no way
out. Or I was too confused to think of one.


I realized that I was slowly disintegrating as a human
being. I was paralyzed, without will or direction--paralyzed
by my drinking, my misery, by the frightening
combination of events that seemed conspiring with almost
human intelligence to destroy me.


It had to come to an end.


One Friday night Mark vanished with Sonny. He was
seen at a Hollywood nightspot and reportedly Sonny was
sleeping at the home of a blonde nightclub hostess with
whom Mark stayed.


Acting on a hunch, I gathered enough courage to go to

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I've been having a terrible time,” I told her. “It's true
I've been drinking, but it's Mark who has the drinking
problem. Along with that, he seems to be a paranoiac.
He's calm one moment and mad the next. Look what he
did to me.” I opened my dress and showed her my bandaged
ribs.


“Mrs. Harris!” She was horrified. “I wouldn't have believed--”


As in a third-rate thriller, the door opened and Mark
walked in. He bore down on me. “You drunken slut,” he
rasped, “I'm taking you to the corner of Hollywood and
Vine and I'll teach you how to show yourself. I'm going
to strip every inch of clothing from you.”


The blonde screamed. “Mark, you're crazy!” He
pushed her roughly aside, pulled me out of the house
and forced me into his car. As we drove, he began ripping
at my clothes. At Vine Street I managed to open the
door, almost tumbled out, and ran sobbing to the nearest
taxi. “Hurry, please, for God's sake,” I gasped. “My husband
is going to kill me.”


We had not yet begun to move when Mark laid his
hand on the driver's arm.


“Look, Mac,” he said, lowering his voice confidentially,
“my wife is very drunk and she doesn't know what she's
doing. You can see what she's done to her clothes. She's
just come out of an insane asylum and it looks as though

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The driver looked at me, frantic and shaking, and then
at Mark, calm and self-possessed.


“Excuse me, Buddy,” he said to Mark. “I thought you
were going to harm her.” He put his hand back and
opened the door. He looked at me through the rear-window
mirror. “You better go with your husband, lady.”


Our landlady was bending over me next morning in
the apartment house, shaking me and shouting that it
was a shame to have people like me on the premises. She
had heard the racket the night before, but hadn't interfered
because she thought it was a husband-and-wife
spat. “But just an hour ago your husband phoned me
from out of town and asked me to look in on you,” she
said. “I didn't tell him you had another man here last
night, but all I have to say is, it would have served you
right if I did!”


My eyes were black, my lips were swollen, I was one
mass of pain, but the landlady wouldn't believe my explanation
that Mark drove me home, sneaked out the
back way after beating me, and then telephoned her.


I could not argue with her. A refrain drummed in my
brain: <i>I've got to get out, I've got to get out</i>. I managed
to pack an overnight bag, and went to Amy's apartment.
I threw all caution to the winds. What could he do that
he hadn't done before? I telephoned a lawyer to start divorce
proceedings and to hire a bodyguard for me. Then,
accompanied by a policeman, I returned to our apartment.


Ringing the bell, even pounding on the door, was of no
avail “We'll have to break it down, then,” the policeman
said.

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He stepped back a few paces, when the landlady
joined us.


“She's no good, officer,” she snapped, flinging a look
of utter contempt at me. “She has the sweetest husband
in the world but she's always passed out in there. This
woman is no good. I'm telling you.”


“All right, lady, you've told me, now you go about your
business,” the policeman said.


He broke down the door, with the help of the handyman
in the building. We walked into the kitchen, then
the living room. Mark appeared from the bedroom, a
puzzled expression on his face. “I've been asleep,” he
said, as if collecting his thoughts. “What seems to be the
trouble, officer?”


“Asleep with all that noise?” the policeman demanded.
Mark nodded.


“You're awake now. Pack your things and get out.”


My husband took on an injured air. “You're not listening
to her, are you, officer? This is an awfully sick
woman. She is out of her mind.”


“Tell that to the court. You've got to leave these premises
and keep your hands off her--”


Mark's face was beginning to show storm signals, and
I hid behind the policeman, who turned to me. “Now,
lady, don't you be afraid--”


Mark lunged at me.


Without a word the cop jabbed him in the side with
his stick. “Get out of here before I take you in!” he
roared. Mark threw a venomous glance at me and left.


For the next week I ventured out only with my body-guard,
although most of the time I tried to blot out everything
with alcohol. Then I had a recollection of my

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mark walked in. He hadn't gone to Chicago after all!
“Get out, Johnny,” he said. “I want to talk to Lillian. I'll
be downstairs in a few minutes.”


“Don't go, Johnny,” I cried.


“Get out of this room or you will be killed,” Mark said
quietly.


“Johnny--” I pleaded.


Mark turned to me. “What's the matter, you sleeping
with him?” I thought desperately, was he going to involve
this boy in our divorce suit? “You better go,” I said,
and Johnny, white-faced, left.


Mark sat down on the lounge, crossed his legs comfortably,
and smiled. “You think you're going to have
everything your way, don't you?”


“No, I didn't think I was going to have everything my
way.”


“Come here, I want to talk to you.”


“What for?”


“Just come here, I want to talk to you.”


Perhaps I can humor him, I thought fleetingly, as I
approached him. As I came near him, he suddenly drew
his right knee back, and viciously plunged his shoe into
my stomach, driving me backward across the room into
another chair.


I lay there, retching, gasping for breath. For a timeless
moment we stared at each other.


The telephone on the stand next to me rang. Slowly,
like a sleepwalker, I answered it. “Yes,” I managed to say.

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Lillian, it's Amy. Everything all right?”


“Amy, would you please--” I began. I wanted to complete
the sentence with “come over right away.” But
Mark grabbed the phone and before I realized what happened,
he was using it to club me savagely on my arm,
on my elbow, beating me again and again, from wrist
up to shoulder, from shoulder down to wrist, methodically,
steadily. In a daze of agony I heard Amy's voice,
thin and anxious, emanating weirdly from the rising and
falling instrument. “Lillian! Lillian!”


Mark stopped beating me. “Everything's fine,” he said
casually into the mouthpiece. “She's just so drunk she
passed out.” He replaced the telephone.


I was slumped in the chair, more unconscious than
conscious, my right arm dangling. I heard Mark in the
bedroom. Was he searching for liquor? Then, no sound
for minutes. Perhaps he had blacked out. Perhaps I could
telephone for help--


Laboriously I lifted the receiver with my left hand.
There was a noise. Mark had rushed back into the room.
He grabbed a long black address book off the stand and
whipped me across the face with it. Pain tore at my right
eye: warm blood gushed over my cheek. The wire edging
of the back of the book had ripped open the right eyelid.


“You think you're going to get help,” Mark said clearly.
“I'm not through with you yet.”


I ran wildly toward the window to scream for help,
perhaps to hurl myself through it. He seized me from
behind, dragged me into the bedroom, and threw me to
the floor. As I lay there, he opened the closet, pulled out
my clothes, and began ripping them. In a frenzy he tore
and pulled until everything was in shreds. He looked

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I woke to agonizing consciousness. It was dark. My
right arm lay useless at my side. I crawled to the telephone
and called an ambulance. At St. Vincent's Hospital,
Dr. Thomas took over--for the third time. He only
shook his head as he worked, giving me opiates for the
pain, treating my eyelid and the livid contusions on my
arm, breast and stomach. The police interviewed me,
photographed my bruises for use in prosecuting Mark,
and advised the hospital they wanted the X-rays for
evidence.


The District Attorney visited me.


He spoke briskly. “This girl began divorce proceedings.
She thought she was perfectly safe. Now look at her. I
want her husband brought in.”


This time Mark really had flown to Chicago, taking
Sonny with him. Extradition would take time and money,
and my funds had dwindled shockingly. “I know this
man,” I told the D. A. “We will get him with his own
help. He'll call me sooner or later.”


He called me from Chicago. The old charm came gushing

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“That's all right, Mark. You put Sonny into a hospital
and come out here and we'll see what we can do.”


“Fine, I'll be right out. You know I love you?”


“Of course.”


“Will you tell the police to lay off extradition? I'll come
in myself.”


“All right, Mark.”


A week passed. No Mark. Two weeks later--another
call from him. He had been in the hospital with Sonny
all this time, he said. Not until another month had
elapsed did he arrive. Sonny, of course, was not ill and
had never been. Mark had waited so that by the time
the trial was held, my bruises would have healed. When
he landed at Los Angeles Airport, he was arrested and
charged with felonious assault with intent to kill. Conviction
meant three to ten years in jail.


Next day, he was out on bail and telephoning me. He
was only human, he had the frailties of a man who was
in love and mad about me and sick about himself ... I
must see him.


“O. K., Mark,” I said. “Come over.” It happened to be
the night before the case came up.


If I had it in my heart to pay him back in full, I would
have prepared more fully than I did. To touch him now
would be unclean, even to revenge myself on him was to
humiliate myself. But I bought a monkey wrench just

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“There's only one way to handle a guy like that,”
Johnny said. “Take him out in the alley and give him the
beating of his life.”


I shook my head. I wanted no more scandals. This was
between Mark and me.


Presently the bell rang. “Hello, Mommy.” It was the
old Mark. He appeared a little startled to find a welcoming
committee, but his self-possession returned immediately.
“How do you do, gentlemen?”


“I thought we might go for a ride, Mommy,” Mark
began.


“Oh, we can do that later,” I said. “Sit down and relax.”


He took a chair. Peter stood a little to his left, Lewis
a little to his right. Johnny stood behind him.


“I'd like a drink,” I said. “Wouldn't you, Mark?”


He nodded. “Sure,” he said. “Sure, Mommy.”


I poured myself a drink in the kitchenette, mixed a
tall highball for Mark, and returned to the living room.


“I remember, Mark, how you gave me a drink in
Chicago once,” I said. “It was scotch and soda. It was
like this.”


I threw the contents into his face.


He looked at me uncertainly, pulled out a handkerchief,
and laughed. “Mommy, darling, are you drunk?”


“No, darling, I'm not drunk. I just have a good memory.”
With all my might I gave him a backhand across
his face, my ring gashing his cheek. He began to bleed.

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“You remember the kicks on the shins--do you know
how it feels? It feels like this--” I kicked him on the shins,
and kicked him again.


He howled. “You bitch--”


“You remember how you beat me black and blue with
the telephone, and how you split the top of my head open
in the shower? Remember how you laughed because I
always carried a drink for us in my bag? Well, I've got
something for you in my bag now, too.” I lifted my bag
with the wrench in it and brought it down hard on his
head.


The blow dazed him for a moment: he was crying and
begging. “Boys, this is a sick woman. I love her. She's
crazy, why are you letting her do this to me? She's crazy.”


“Now, boys,” I said, and I was amazed at my own
audacity. “I'm going out for a ride with this man. And he
is going to do everything I say. He's going to be a little
lamb, because the case comes up tomorrow. Aren't you
going to be a little Iamb, Mark?”


“You poor, sick, little Mommy,” he said, dabbing at
his cuts with a handkerchief.


“He's going to be a little lamb,” I went on, “because
if he makes any bruises on me he knows he'll rot in jail.
Isn't that right, Mark?”


He shook his head. “Boys, you should do something
for her. She's real sick!”


“You don't know how right you are!” I yelled. “I'm
sick--sick to death. I don't care what happens to me.
Come on!”

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00189&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The three men escorted us downstairs and watched
silently as he got into the car and I after him. “Now,” I
said, “you take me everywhere I want to go. First, Hollywood
and Vine.”


When we got there, I said, “Do you remember how
you tried to rip off my clothes here?” I slammed my bag
against his head.


“Oh, Mommy!” he groaned. “Why do you want to talk
like that!”


“That was one place. Now, drive up Hollywood Hills.”
When we got there, I said, “Remember how you scared
me, threatening you'd make me jump out of the car here?
Well, move over in that seat. I'm going to drive down
this hill. I'm not afraid to die, you lousy son of a bitch,
and you're going straight to hell with me. I'm not jumping
out of this car, but you're going with me straight to
hell!”


I jammed the accelerator against the floorboard, and
we began to roar down the hill. Mark pulled the brake
sharply. The car skidded to a violent stop.


“I knew you didn't have the guts!” I screamed. “Now,
get out! Get out! I'll see you in court tomorrow.”


I was crying--tears of rage and self-pity and hatred
for this man who had degraded me. I cried for all that
could have been, loathing myself for what I was, and
what had brought me to this. When I reached home, I
drank myself into oblivion.


On the witness stand I told my story. Mark testified in
his own behalf. “Judge, how can you believe her?” he
asked, as a man bewildered because the truth is not self-evident.
“Everyone knows she is a drunk. Why, she almost

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The court commented on the incongruity of a man like
Mark having to defend himself against me. My hospital
X-rays and photographs did the rest. Mark was sentenced
to six months.


The judge summed it up: “You ought to get down on
your knees to this lady because she permitted the charge
to be reduced to simple assault, so that all I can give you
is six months. You deserve the maximum of ten years. I
can't express my contempt for a man who beats a woman.”


Mark looked over at me and laughed. “Mommy, I won't
be in there six months. I'll still get you. Watch.”


My marriage to Mark Harris was annulled on the
ground that when I married him I had no cognizance of
his criminal activities.

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00191&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XVII


THE YEAR I had known Mark seemed one long nightmare.
Now it was over. Where did I stand? How was I
going to pick up the pieces? Katie pleaded with me to
live with her. She was in Long Island, at the home of
my sister Ann--little Ann who used to lament that she
“never got anywhere in show business.” But Ann was
married, her husband was loving and attentive, a baby
was on the way, and life had taken on a sane, recognizable
pattern for her. The other half of “The Roth Kids”
was a drunken, thrice-married has-been.


I didn't want Katie to see what was happening to me.
And Dad had remarried and was living quietly in Boston.
I didn't fit in there, either.


There was nothing to do but remain alone. When I
tried to cast up my accounts, I found that I still had some
money left of my fortune--a few thousand dollars. I could
still sing, but nobody was particularly eager to hear me.
The bad dream was over. Now what?


I cared for nothing, yet I had to go on. I was constantly
ill. It was impossible to face daylight without
sunglasses: light seared my eyes. I walked hurriedly on
the street, peering fearfully over my shoulder in expectation
that Mark would suddenly materialize from nowhere
and bear down on me. If a friend waved at me, I ducked:

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But if I wanted to be able to continue to buy liquor,
I had to continue to work. I managed to obtain bookings
in Chicago, Oakland, and then Vancouver. After the tour
I wired fare to Katie to join me in California.


She came to live with me--a little more tired, a little
more apprehensive, the same questioning look in her eyes,
but still with the same saving grace of humor.


My thirty-first birthday was a month away when Dot
Pondell, my make-up girl so many years ago, invited me
to a party at her home and introduced me to Victor
Engel. “You two ought to know each other,” she said.
Victor seemed familiar from the first. There was a gaiety
about him which I found attractive. I had not known
such an outgoing personality since Fred Keating. And,
like Fred he could make me laugh, and I needed
laughter.


When he took me to dinner, he watched silently while
I drank. He never lectured me. In my high moments he
thought me charming, and when I impersonated people
for our friends, he applauded louder than the rest.
“You're wonderful,” he would say. No one had said anything
like that to me for a long time.


Often I passed out when we returned from dinner,
but there was no reproach. Instead, while I slept off my
drunkenness--Victor was sure I would stop drinking
sooner or later--he played gin rummy with Katie.

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I liked his solicitude for her. He treated her as if he
were her son. It helped make up a little for me.


They were engrossed in a card game one night when I
stumbled out of my bedroom. I had suddenly become
wide awake. “Daddy's in trouble,” I said. “I know it.”


My mother looked at me, compassion and despair
struggling in her face. “Are you having another of your
nightmares?”


“No. It's a premonition, Mom. I'm going to call him.”


Although it was past midnight, I put through a call to
Boston. It was refused by Arthur's cousin, who undoubtedly
conjectured that I was drunk. For a moment I was
stopped: then I sent a wire. “Lillian needs operation,
must contact Arthur.” I signed it “Katie.”


A few hours later a reply came: my father was in
Boston Hospital with a blood clot in his leg. Surgeons
planned an amputation.


I had to go to Boston, although I was in no physical
condition to make the trip across the continent. Wearing
dark glasses, and with two bottles of bourbon in my bag, I
got aboard a plane and managed to get to Boston Hospital.
Half a dozen relatives were there: without an exception,
they turned away when I appeared. My father was a pitiable
shadow of himself when I found him in a public ward.


“Hello, sweetheart,” he said, but there was panic in his
eyes. “Lillian, baby, for God's sake, don't let them cut off
my leg.”


But there was no other course.


I made arrangements for a private room and private
nurses. When Arthur came out of the ether, I was at his
bedside. He grinned weakly. “You know I'm tough,” he
whispered. “I'll have myself a wooden leg and bounce

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I bought him a fifth, and we drank together.


I took a room in a small hotel. It was impossible for
me to hold any food. I drank small amounts of liquor
through the day, but it would not take effect. I sat by
Arthur's bed, sober-drunk. On the fourth day he woke
from a drugged sleep and, apparently for the first time,
saw me as I was. “For God's sake, Lillian,” he exclaimed
in despair, “Lillian, you could be a beautiful girl again,
you could be on top of the world. For God's sake, when
are you going to leave that bottle alone! You're dying--
you need a bed next to me.” He groaned. “If I were only
up! I can't stand to see what you're doing to yourself.”


That afternoon the doctor informed me they must
amputate again. When Dad was told later, he said, “Don't
worry, kiddie. I'll be all right.” He was silent for a
moment. “I wish you'd try to get yourself booked at some
club--maybe you'd go easier on that bottle.”


Ann arrived, and we took turns keeping vigil at his
bedside. We visited his shabby little apartment, and
talked to his wife. The story of his life during the past
few years was written on the walls of those dark, half-furnished
rooms.


He had refused, his wife said, to let me know about
his financial reverses. They had had a few happy, prosperous
years, but Arthur still had visions of making that
last big killing, and was unable to keep a job long enough
to learn the names of his co-workers. His big deals never

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They had lived in a large apartment at the beginning,
later moving to smaller quarters, storing all but bare
essentials. They had been unable to meet the small payments
and the warehouse had taken possession of their
furniture.


I gave his wife several hundred dollars before I left
Boston. “When you're ready for that artificial leg, Daddy,
I'll take care of it,” I promised him. I paid his medical
and hospital bills, prepaid his rent for several months,
and took an upper berth back to California.


At least, I had done one decent thing for my father.


On the train I suffered acute abdominal pains. In Los
Angeles Dr. Thomas once more examined me. I must
have an operation. Mark's blows, my drinking, internal
inflammations dating back to the baby I had lost, all
played a part.


“Oh, my poor Lilly,” my mother said, trying not to cry,
“everything happens to you--you're not spared anything.”


She still believed that my difficulties were due to
others, not to me. “You were always used, used by everybody,”
she wept.


I signed a waiver absolving the hospital of responsibility,
if the operation proved fatal, for my drinking, as
Dr. Thomas told me, made me a bad surgical risk. When
I awoke, he held my hand. “You're tough, Lillian,” he
said. “I never thought I'd pull you out of this one.”


Next day he sat by my bed and talked earnestly to me.


“I've told you often before that you must not drink.
Now, you <i>can't</i> drink. Do you understand? If you do,
you may die.”

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I thought, suppose I did? I have nothing behind me
but shame, nothing before me but the gutter.


“Vic,” I said, when he visited me, “the doctor says I
need a tonic. Buy me some cherry brandy.” When friends
called I made the same request. Some days I consumed
more than a fifth of brandy. Dr. Thomas came into my
room one night to find my callers playing cards while I
lay tipsily in bed.


His lips compressed. “Take her home,” he ordered.
“We can't handle her here.” <i>Even he is giving me up</i>, I
thought. A day later I was wandering about my apartment
hugging a bottle.


Ann came out for a brief visit. There was a moment
when Victor and I were alone. “Let's fly to Nevada and
get married,” he said. In my drunken state it seemed an
excellent idea. Although I recall Victor's proposal, and
remember the flight, the wedding ceremony is a blank.
I recall whimpering to myself while Victor lay beside me,
<i>I've done it again. I've done it again</i>.


We walked in on my mother. She was playing cards
with a group of women. “Mother,” I announced, “I'm
married.” The cards fell from her hands, and she stared at
me, her eyes beginning to brim with tears. “Oh, Lillian,”
she whispered. A lifetime of anguish was in those two
words.


Next day she and Ann were gone. The note my
mother left read:


“You're married, and Ann and I are going back to New York.
I have to do it this way, darling. I can't stand to stay here and
watch you kill yourself.”


With Pearl Harbor, Victor was drafted. I wired an
agent, who booked me into the Hurricane, a Broadway

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My opening night brought excellent reviews. Well, I
thought, I can still make it. I must still be good. This deserves
a celebration--just a drink or two. And wasn't I
alone, my husband gone off to the wars? More reason to
try to forget. Waves of self-pity engulfed me. I made a
far from pleasant record at the Hurricane the remainder
of the week. The management spoke to me--the orchestra
leader complained that I reeked of liquor. All I could
think of was, why are they picking on me? Don't they
know I may never see my husband again?


I was requested to leave the show after the first week.
Now I drank heavily to console myself. One morning
before dawn I awoke and looked at the wall. In the half-gloom
of my room I saw a tremendous spider, big as a
rat. I froze. I thought, that is a black-widow spider, and
if it comes near me and bites me, I'll die. I felt a gurgling
in my throat and I passed out. When I woke a little later,
the spider was gone. I thought, I must have had a bad
dream. But the next morning it was there again ...


Since Victor was taking his basic training at Camp
Belvoir, Virginia, I got an engagement in nearby Washington,
then arranged with the help of the camp's morale
officer to bring the troupe to Victor and his fellow-trainees.
But at Belvoir I became violently ill, wracked
by sharp, stabbing pains. The army doctors diagnosed
it as colitis and a liver ailment--a polite way of saying
that I suffered from acute alcoholism.


I had to return to New York. I took a room by myself.


Then I learned that Dad, too, was living alone, in
Boston. He had separated from his wife. It was a strange

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I telephoned him at midnight. There was no answer.
I rang repeatedly, but not until 3 a.m. was I able to reach
him. “Daddy,” I said, “I just can't get you off my mind.
Are you all right?”


His voice came back: “Of course I am. You know, I've
been thinking of you, too. How are you, baby? Have you
given up that lousy booze?”


“I'm all right, Daddy. I've got a little sore throat at
the moment, but as soon as I can, I'm coming up to see
you. You sure you're all right?”


“I'm fine.


“Well, where were you just a little while ago?”


“I was right here, baby.”


“I bet you're drinking,” I said.


“I bet <i>you're</i> drinking,” he said.


“No, I'm not.”


“Well, I'm not--I swear I'm not.”


I felt better when I hung up. At six o'clock in the
morning the telephone rang. It was a man's voice. “You
don't know me, Miss Roth. I have something to tell you.
Your father is dead.”


The hotel maid had found him slumped across a card
table. He had been playing solitaire when he suffered
the heart attack.


I sat with a bottle. What else was there?

[p. <i>193</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

CHAPTER XVIII


I SPOKE DISTINCTLY.


“I'm warning you. I know you're broadcasting everything
I'm thinking. Now, you stop it!”


“Who is this?” demanded the bewildered voice at the
other end of the line. I had dialed the radio station located
atop our hotel.


“You know very well who it is. I don't have to tell you.
You better stop, that's all. Goodbye.”


I had been aware of it my first day in Niagara Falls,
for everything I touched vibrated. I exuded radio waves.


“You're silly,” Victor laughed. “That's the vibration
from the Falls. Everyone knows that.”


He couldn't convince me. We had been in Niagara
Falls since his discharge from the army a week earlier.
I wanted no one to see or recognize me: Niagara Falls
seemed as good a hideout as any.


Victor had a job, selling dry goods, at $70 a week.
Except for a few savings bonds, my funds--everything I
had--were gone. I spent the days walking a German shepherd
dog Victor had bought me, and testing my unusual
ability to pick up and transmit electrical waves. Everywhere
I felt the trembling. Everywhere I saw military
men guarding the enormous power installations, watching

[p. <i>194</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Vic,” I said a few nights later, “I'm electrified. Foreign
agents think I know our defense secrets and they've
wired our room to get my vibrations.”


“Oh, Lil, will you lay off that stuff? I told you the Falls
make everything shake. The only thing wrong with you
is you drink too much.”


I feared to look into our bureau mirror, because it
might well be a diabolical machine planted there by
Canadian Nazis to telecast my face to Berlin, where the
secrets could be read through my eyes. I could not sleep.
“Vic, the mattresses are wired. I'll be electrocuted.”


“Don't be silly,” he said wearily. “Come over on my
side.”


“They'll electrocute me on that side, too, Vic. Wherever
I lie, my body will contact the electricity in the
bed.”


He sat up and looked at me.


“Lil, you're sick, you know that?”


“How can you be so ridiculous? How can I be sick? I
have no fever. What are you talking about?”


“O. K. So you're not sick. But if you ask me, I think
you ought to go back to your mother in New York and
I'll go back to California.”


“Oh, no. You're not getting rid of me like that. The
marriage service says in sickness and in health, but I'm
not sick,” I repeated. “And how can she take care of me?
I have no money for either of us. I can't go back.”


Victor punched his pillow and lay down again.


The radio commentators described our soldiers trapped

The commentators spoke even when my radio was
turned off. Sometimes, in their eagerness, their faces materialized
from the cloth mesh covering the loudspeaker,
and, mouths working and eyes glistening, they advanced
toward me. I backed up, frightened, but not too surprised.
This was understandable to anyone who had read
about the extra-sensory perception experiments at Duke
University. I had always had premonitions, and what
were premonitions but extra-sensory perception?


That the enemy could draw my knowledge away telepathically
weighed heavily on me. Perhaps drinking
would be considered patriotic under such special circumstances,
I reasoned. If I became muddled with liquor,
I'd confuse enemy agents: they'd tap my brain and get
nothing but mental static. I liked the idea.


Fortunately, it seemed that I was vulnerable to the
enemy only on cloudy days, for everyone knows the sun
weakens radio waves. On cloudy days I hid in my darkened
room, drinking patriotically and avoiding the
mirror. On sunny days, I ventured out.


One afternoon, strolling serenely with my dog, I passed
a church. Near the door a neat printed sign read: YOU
ARE WELCOME. ENTER AND REST. On impulse I
walked into the dark, cool interior and slipped softly into

[p. <i>196</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A bell tinkled. A priest, genuflecting as he passed in
front of the altar, glanced at me. For a moment our eyes
met, and held. Then he disappeared through a door at
the side of the altar.


I walked dreamily out of the church, into the warm,
terribly bright sunshine. Was not the meaning of the
glance between the priest and myself clear: <i>Do not hide
any more. You are in God's world and you are welcome.
You do not have to hide any more</i>.


“Vic,” I said that night. “Let's leave this town. I'm sure
my nerves will straighten out if we go back to California.
And I might get a few bookings there.” Victor, who was
bored with the Falls, thought that a good idea. We could
live with his married sister in Los Angeles--she had an
eight-room house--until I earned enough money to rent
an apartment for us. But where would we get money
for fare to the coast? What with our hotel bills, and my
two quarts of liquor a day, we hadn't been able to save
anything from Victor's salary.


I phoned Katie collect and she sent me a money order
for $600, every cent she could scrape together. She had
obtained it by pawning what she had left of the jewelry
Ann and I had given her through the years.


Once in Los Angeles, Victor got more money by selling
my silver fox cape for $50--the last fur I had, which

[p. <i>197</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At his sister's house I tried to taper off on a quart of
wine a day, the cheapest drink I could buy. Victor obtained
a job in a credit jewelry store. I had little to do
with his sister, her husband, or their three children, aged
twelve to seventeen. Instead, I spent my time in our
second-floor guest room, sipping wine and poring over
the Bible.


If God wanted me to hide no longer, I must read His
book. Marie Stoddard wasn't here to help explain the
difficult passages, but certainly the Bible should partially
insulate me from the vibrations, the radio waves, the
spectral faces, the enemy agents trying to siphon away
my secrets.


Victor and his sister had words about me. Her voice
was shrill and carried to our room. “I've got children in
this house! I won't have her here. Not another day.”


I opened the door and came to the head of the stairs.
“You needn't shout,” I said clearly. “I understand.” I
heard her voice again. “I'm going out to shop. All I say
to you is, be sure she's out of here by the time I get
back.”


I approached her later. I asked carefully, “Does Vic
want to get rid of me, too?”


She said, “Yes. You'll have to leave today.”


I packed a bag and left. I ventured to ask some friends
if they would put me up overnight until I decided what
to do. They politely declined. I stood on a street corner,
bag in hand, bewildered. I could not wire Katie that
Victor had put me out. I walked aimlessly. How would
I get into a hotel? They were crowded because of the
war. From some dim recess of my memory, Christian

[p. <i>198</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hotels ... hotels ... My fingers stopped shakily at
Hotel Christo. That was enough. The name was a sign. I
telephoned the clerk: a man had checked out a few minutes
earlier--a room was available if I came over at once.


It was among the cheapest one-night hotels. “I must
be humble,” I said to myself. “Didn't Mary Baker Eddy
say that Jesus Christ was humble?” The curtains in my
room were filthy, the furniture ancient. A Gideon Bible
lay on the table which was pockmarked with the butts
of a thousand cigarettes held in the vanished hands of a
thousand lonely souls....


I undressed, got into bed, and fell asleep with the
Bible under my pillow.


I awoke suddenly, light-headed. I was alone, the first
time in my life I was absolutely alone. God, I thought,
will take care of me. He will provide. The morning sun
streamed in, a bright pathway of dancing dust motes in
the murky gloom of my room. I turned my eyes away:
the bright light burned....


I was lying in bed, looking up. The curtains fluttered,
as if teased by a gentle wind. They parted slowly, and a
white figure appeared with two men on either side. The
figure was Christ, dressed in white, a gold band about
His forehead. I could not recognize the others. They wore
dark skull caps and dark clothes. The Figure approached
me. His hand seemed to float forth and with infinite

[p. <i>199</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The shrilling of the telephone awakened me. “I've been
looking everywhere for you.” It was Victor. “Lil, I did the
wrong thing. We'd better get together. We'll work something
out.”


He took me to an apartment, but he was away most of
the day and night, returning only to supply me with
yellow pills. I took the pills to sleep, and the liquor to
bring me out of the lethargy of dope. The combination
tore at my nerves. When I tried to walk, or do anything
at all, I went into raging tantrums at my inability to
function.


Then Victor left me. He never said a word. He had had
enough.


Everything became confused. An elderly man from
the film colony who had known me since “The Roth
Kids,” unaccountably appeared in the room and tried to
make violent love to me. Now I was in the street, clutching
the arm of a soldier, begging him to come to my room
and “get that ugly old man out of there.” Now I awakened
from a heavy sleep. It was daylight. The old man
and my landlady were chatting at my door. “I knew her
mother and father,” the old man said. “I'm a good friend
of the family.” “Well, I'm glad, poor thing,” said my
landlady as she left. “Do take good care of her.” The door
shut behind her, and the old man turned toward me with
an odd smile on his lips. I tried to cry out, and then I
was asleep again.


Was it an hour later, or twelve hours later? I opened
my eyes. A thin, effeminate young man was in my room,

[p. <i>200</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Get out of here!” I moaned.


“Hi, Lillian,” he said. “My name's Lionel. Vic sent me
to watch over you. I won't bother you.” He giggled.


I began to wail.


“All right, aU right,” he said. “I'll go.”


Then it was night again, and I lay half conscious on
the sofa. I heard a whisper, as from far off: “Lillian,
Lillian, Lillian.” It came from the ventilator. There was
no one in the room. Am I going mad? I looked at the
clock: it showed three o'clock, and it was dark outside.
“Lillian!” the voice whispered urgently, and the ventilator
rattled. I stumbled out of bed and found the land-lady.
“My God, see if I'm going crazy. Is there somebody
in that ventilator?”


In her bedclothes she rushed to my room. She opened
the grate and looked down. Lionel was there, in the basement,
drunk. He had been watching to see if any men
visited me. Later I realized Victor had brought me to the
room in hope men would call on me so that he would
have grounds for divorce.


I slept, and woke again. Now everything was gone.
My radio, my records, my clothes.


In one awful, lucid moment, I paced back and forth
in front of the jewelry store where Victor worked. I
grabbed his arm when he emerged for lunch. “Vic, I
need money. You've taken everything. I got to have a
little money--enough to get by. I have to pay the rent.
I have to eat.”


He pushed me away, and walked on. I struggled after

[p. <i>201</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“I'm not drinking, Vic,” I gasped, laboring after him.
“I promise you. For God's sake, let me have a few
dollars.”


He turned on me, his face white. “Get away from me,
you--”. Words failed him. “Get--or I'll call a cop, you
miserable, no-good bum!”


Days later I sat dully in a lawyer's office. Victor had
sued me, and on his terms. “Let him get the divorce,”
the attorney advised me. “Or he'll drag you through the
courts with your drinking, and that old man, and all the
rest.”


“I tried to keep the old man out,” I faltered. “He had
a key and the landlady let him in. Half the time I didn't
know he was there.”


The attorney sighed. “And throw away those pills your
husband left you. They keep you all doped up. You're
passed out most of the time.”


I sat numbly. The door opened and the lawyer's secretary
came in. She had a stunned look on her face. “President
Roosevelt is dead,” she said in a hushed voice.


Why annoy the lawyer further? The entire country
had suffered a great loss. “Do what you think best,” I
told him. On the way to the elevator I stopped in the
ladies' room and took a long, comforting drink from the
bottle in my bag.


No one offered to help me in the days that followed,
save a poor woman who lived in two rooms above a
Chinese laundry. I do not remember how I met her. I

[p. <i>202</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00208&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And then--a long, blank period.


I did not know it, but I was not altogether forgotten.
There was still my mother, in New York.


Katie, with hardly a penny to her name, was living with
Ann's mother-in-law, for Ann's baby had arrived, and
there was no room for Katie there.


Among the few people my mother saw were two
friends, Estelle and Phyllis Demarest. At their apartment
she met Edna Berger, who lived next door. Edna, a warm,
outgoing and extremely resourceful girl, was international
representative of the American Newspaper Guild, a job
which took her out of town much of the time. She liked
Katie, and often talked to her about me.


One evening my mother visited the Demarests, and
Edna dropped in. Katie was obviously under great tension.
Finally she brought out a letter she had received
that day. It was from the lawyer I had seen about
Victor's suit for divorce. He had written that I was practically
on the streets. Victor had left me. “She's without
funds, Mrs. Roth,” he wrote, “and seems to be a chronic
alcoholic. She seems to be taking drugs of some kind.
She's not rational. I advise you to come out and get her.”


There was an embarrassed silence. Katie began to cry.
“She's my child,” she wept, “and drunk or sober, she's
been a good daughter. I must help her.”


“Katie, how much money will it take to bring Lillian
here?” Edna asked.

[p. <i>203</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004097983-I00209&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“If I could send her $150 for fare--”


“All right,” said Edna. “You have it. We can't let that
girl die. We'll send her the money to come here so you
can take care of her.”


Katie sent me a money order for $150.


Ten days passed without word from me. Edna called
the West Coast, checking with everyone who might know
my whereabouts. They found me living in a small hotel.
I had spent the money for liquor, pills and toys for the
children of the woman who lived over the Chinese
laundry.


“Since we've gone this far,” Edna said to Katie, “let's
go through with it. Here's money to buy a ticket. Go out
there and bring her back yourself.”


With great effort I managed to be at the station. My
mother, her face pale and strained, came off the train
and walked by me. She had not recognized her own
daughter! When she did, she wept like a child. “What's
happened to my baby?” she cried. “What have you done
to yourself!”


In the cab I lay against her shoulder. “I can't help it,
Mom,” I wept. “I can't live without liquor. And I just
couldn't make the trip back home alone.”


“What will we do, Lilly?” my mother asked in despair.
“Oh, my God, what will we do!”


She rented an inexpensive room for us and obtained a
job for $20 a week in a five-and-ten-cent store so that
she could care for me until the divorce came through,
and provide me--even though she loathed it--with at least
a pint of liquor daily so that I would not go completely
out of my mind.


This. I thought--my mother working in a five-and-ten--

On the lowest morning of all, I went to the California
State Employment Office and filled out the necessary
blanks. What kind of job, they asked? I could think of
nothing I was fitted to do. Finally I wrote, “receptionist.”
My tears blotted out the word.
