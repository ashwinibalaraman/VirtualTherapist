BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: ...[Wanted to ask for this weekend] (ph) [sound of something sliding by microphone] [appointment craziness] (ph). Yeah [sighs], uhhhh...
THERAPIST: Well, moving out of the Country is complicated.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah, or not moving out of the Country on time.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah, um, [pauses] — yeah, uh [sighs] [pauses for five seconds]...
THERAPIST: How are you sitting with everything?
CLIENT: [Chuckles] I'm trying not to think about how much I want to describe with this. Uhhh, [pauses] [chuckles] have I complained about this before — the scholarship and...?
THERAPIST: Not to me.
CLIENT: [Chuckles] That's a surprise. Um...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So I'm leaving this $24,000 grant to go to France specifically. It is, you know, an honorary — for this guy, because his [school is in] (ph) Germany, whatever — it is funny; one of his descendants is — his grandson is Mark Harmon, the actor.
THERAPIST: Ah! [Chuckles] [00:00:59]
CLIENT: And just a bit of trivia there. Anyway, so [sighs] they say, you know, "You have to spend the full-time months in the country you've [applied to this] (ph) to do this research."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Well, they don't have to give you any help as far as a visa, and so they say, "Well, just leave after six months and come back, you know, the next day, and then it will restart your tourist visa for another six months." Like, yeah, it is also illegal.
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: And that's all they can say to me.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So I've been trying to get a visa for — I've been trying to get some sort of an affiliation, and I finally got the — mmm — one at the University [sighs] this week — last week. And so I'm applying to that, and now I've got a visa to mix in. First of all, I was like, "There's no way I can stay here for another six weeks while I wait for this process to finish."
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: It is such a long list. Then I realized if I don't do this, it is going to be a headache for everything [taps surface] I do over there, and so [pauses] my wife's leaving Tuesday, and I'm staying 'til I don't know when. [Chuckles] [00:02:08]
THERAPIST: Oh, wow.
CLIENT: Yeah. And, um [pauses]...
THERAPIST: You still have your place here, or you're...?
CLIENT: No. [Chuckles] And that was the other big reason why I wasn't going to wait around for that long. A friend of mine, a former work colleague, has a house here, [hits surface] and she travels between [pauses] here and Portland regularly, so...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And — so she's going to let me stay there. [Sighs] Um, [pauses] meanwhile, I'm still trying to get my daughter (ph) on a flight. [Chuckles] And I'm pushing for Sunday, but it might be Monday or it might be Tuesday, so I had to go to the mail (ph) today and get new forms, because they're only good for ten days; drive out to Sun...?
THERAPIST: [Faintly] I have no idea. [00:02:56]
CLIENT: It is an hour away, but the USDA (ph) offices to get them certified, and then back (ph), and now I'm here. So [chuckles] every day is kind of like this... [00:03:07]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Jigsaw puzzle. Um, [pauses] so, yeah, I can't tell you when I'm going to be leaving. Um, [pauses] I imagine it'll be three weeks. So, um [pauses] — but actually, I know I've said this before, but I actually think I won't be busy after Tuesday [chuckles]...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Because I have no plans. I mean...
THERAPIST: 'Cause you didn't expect to be here.
CLIENT: I didn't expect to be here. And, uh [pauses] so I — I do want to finish that letter and, um, pass it by you, and see [you next summer] (ph). That's where I am — um, [pauses] kind of crazed but not too bad. I mean, that's unhappy to deal with the customs in Amsterdam and, um, people with the University is — like, you have to get up at four in the morning to see if they've (ph) responded to my e-mail, so I can get a response back, and you [might as well] sleep in. It has been kind of crazy. And, uh — but my [sighs] stress level is OK, um, [clucks] I think. Uh, [pauses] no big problems... [00:04:21]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...As far as [inaudible at 04:23] [Sighs] But, [sighs] you know, it is fun because I was going through my medications...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...That I want to make sure I have with me. So we're shipping a pallet with all sorts of stuff over there, and that takes six weeks to get there, so I'm like, "OK, what medications am I going to be needing?" [Pauses] Uh...
THERAPIST: How much can you travel with?
CLIENT: Well, I don't know. [Chuckles] Um, a three-month supply is what I have.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: But, um, [pauses] — but the reason I imagine is that, you know, I still have that loraze...
THERAPIST: ...Lorazepam. [00:05:00]
CLIENT: ...Lorazepam, and I've only taken like one or two since — <i>sssss</i> — I don't know — last year, but I'm packing it because...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...[Slaps surface] I'm not sure what it is going to be like.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I don't know. I guess, it is...
THERAPIST: And there's nothing wrong with using it if you need it.
CLIENT: No, not at all, but I just — [chuckles] I think I'm taking one for tomorrow for this garage sale because I do get kind of an elevated heart rate for these things. So, anyway, [sighs] I had a tax (ph) appointment yesterday, and it is just like everything is coming down to [what I'm going to do] (ph).
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: So I don't know what else to tell you. [Chuckles in exasperation]
THERAPIST: What are you feeling in the moment?
CLIENT: Uhhh, I'm [so uncertain] (ph). I mean, I drove down where [to — very quickly] (ph). Um, not that it is that great a place to put my head, but, uh [pauses] — [sighs] I'm feeling like, slowly, things are starting to feel like they're coming to an end. [Slaps surface] [Clears throat] Things in the apartment are dwindling. [00:06:17]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Uh, [pauses] and, uh, I'm feeling a bit of fear about it. You know? And [pauses] I got [sighs] huh [chuckles in exasperation] — you know, I — every once in a while, I will remind myself that certainty is like an unfounded luxury that we just seem to expect.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know? And, uh [pauses] I don't know what's going to happen in the next three weeks. I don't know if I'm going to get a visa. Um, [pauses]I don't know what's going to happen, but, um [pauses] — you know, I didn't plan for this.
THERAPIST: Mm. [00:06:56]
CLIENT: And [pauses for five seconds] — but, I mean, it was — it was kind of interesting because I was wondering what life would be like if we had certainty. If it was, you know, "When I graduate high school, I'm going to Harvard; then I'm going to law school, and I'm going to be a lawyer; and then I'm going to run for Senate." It is like that would be so incredibly boring if you just <i>knew</i> what is going to happen...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...You know, in a series. And I was just trying to think how can I embrace the spontaneity...?
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Or the, um — just the happenstance of uncertainty and not knowing, and not look at it as a [pauses] foreboding kind of, um, you know, mystery but an exciting one that good things will happen in? [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST: A delightful surprise. [00:07:55]
CLIENT: Yeah! And — I don't know — I'm just not used to doing that. [Slaps surface] I mean, surprises have never been — that's not true. Surprises have <i>always</i> been good for me; it is only infrequently that they haven't, and yet I think they haven't all the time, and then I... [slaps surface]
THERAPIST: Yeah, your anticipation of what might happen in surprise is different than, really, your experience of what the surprise might be.
CLIENT: [Sighs] Yeah. And, I mean, that also led me to bel — when I think about — you know, we will get these things all the time, but how we deal with them — you know...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] I don't think it is like we're not going to be affected by them, but [pauses] I guess I'd just like to [pauses] try to be more open to the possibility that [pauses] — that I can <i>count</i> on uncertainty, and I need not make it, um, a self-fulfilling prophecy. [00:09:11]
You know? Because I think I can jeopardize things by expecting certain things and then playing the part. You know? But, um, [pauses] yeah, I just don't know what that looks like right now, as far as how you — how you live that way and how you [pauses for seven seconds] — I don't look as life as a series of tragedies, you know, or a series of [clears throat] — it is a few highs and it is a few lows. It is a very [flaunty medicine] (ph) [chuckles]
THERAPIST: That's OK. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Hadn't (ph)...
CLIENT: Uh, so [clucks] yeah — I mean, I don't know what's going to happen [slaps surface] in — I mean, also, as I unpack things, as I get rid of things, it is like, "I don't know if I'll use this. I don't know if I'll <i>miss</i> this." [00:10:09]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: You know?
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, [pauses] it is kind of exciting, and I don't know — but, at the same time, it is like, you know, what will it say, you know, if I get back and leave after a year or [pauses for eight seconds] — I don't know. I guess it just comes down to me being OK with the path I'm choosing. You know? And — [sighs]...
THERAPIST: How far does that path extend in your mind?
CLIENT: Not very far. [Chuckles] I mean, presumably for the next year.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I — I [slaps surface] know some of the circumstances...
THERAPIST: You don't have to choose beyond it.
CLIENT: ...Yeah, around that — that timeframe. Beyond that, I don't know if I'll be in Taipei (ph) or France or the Middle East, or back here, or — I don't know. [Slaps surface] [00:11:03]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] so yeah, I mean. [Pauses] I don't know. I guess, when you go to see a movie, you expect to be surprised and...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Don't want it hidden.
THERAPIST: And we're often disappointed when we're not right, and...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...A lot of the critique you hear is like, "<i>Ach</i>, <i>sooo</i> predictable."
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: You hear people walking out on what they're disappointed about?
CLIENT: Yeah, it is like uncertainty is — is built in, and you're like, "Well, that wasn't very exciting."
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know? And...
THERAPIST: "You could see <i>that</i> one coming a mile away." I mean, there's a bunch of sayings around it.
CLIENT: Exactly, yeah. And — and you're right. I mean, I guess [drops object] [sighs] certainty <i>is</i> overrated and, um...
THERAPIST: What are the things that you feel like you need to be certain in order to be comfortable with other things being uncertain?
CLIENT: [Drops object] Um, I think my own mental health, my own wellbeing. Um, just — just knowing that I'm maintaining that. You know, um, [pauses] I think my, uh — my ability to [pauses], A, have a positive outlook on things is fundamentally affected by how well I'm taking care of myself. [00:12:21]
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I mean, it is like a direct relationship. Um, I can't think of anything else that does have that, um...
THERAPIST: And you have some control over that.
CLIENT: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, and so I'm don't know that I call that certainty, but it — it is — it is, um, intelligence about what I need to do. [Pauses] I don't know. Does that make sense? I don't know what you asked anymore. What did you say? [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I [chuckles] asked what you needed to be certain so you felt comfortable with other things being uncertain.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: And I think that sense, you know, whether it is certainty or a sense of security with... [00:13:01]
CLIENT: Oh, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...With how you're taking care of yourself and your mental health.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Or, [clucks] [sounds of fidgeting] I mean, I guess I could even say a sense of routine. You know...
[Recording Part 1 ends]
[Recording Part 2 begins]
THERAPIST: OK, we're back again.
[Sound of adjusting something]
CLIENT: This is part two...
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Of August tenth. Um, [pauses] yeah, I mean, one of the things I — I do [beep sounds] — I don't fear but I want to ensure that I make a priority is the — the routine. You know, um, I'm not good with it.
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: I know that, [sound of banging in background] and whatever I can do to kind of build that in to my time here, which I know is indeterminate, and then my time there. So, [pauses] um, [pauses] that's what I think I need to do in order to be able to, um, embrace uncertainty.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: It'll be challenging <i>here</i> since you don't know — or have a hard time knowing just like... [00:01:00]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST: ...How long do you [set up enough for it] (ph)...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...I'm guessing some of the things that help you keep a routine are not really there anymore...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...Like an apartment...
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...That you can call your own.
CLIENT: Or a car or, you know...
THERAPIST: Or the gym, or a...
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I still belong to the gym.
THERAPIST: Oh, OK. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Thankfully, I didn't cancel that. And the — her house is right off the bus line, so I take that same bus.
THERAPIST: Mm. I thought — so it is something...
CLIENT: And so there is something that is...
THERAPIST: ...That is challenging or could be.
CLIENT: Well, yes, but [chuckles] — you know, there are [chuckles] lots of other things that I'm...
THERAPIST: Mm.
CLIENT: ...I'm just not going to have <i>or</i> there. The house (ph) - I'm getting rid of, which is great.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I think it also might be an opportunity to set in motion, set in — you know, in place a routine to see how well it works.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: You know, um, my time is going to be, uh, [clucks] you know, unmeasured here; it is going to be unmeasured there. [Pauses] And, uh, so how I — how do I, uh, [pauses] use it wisely, use it in a way that I feel like I am [pauses] progressing or taking care of myself in another way. You know? So, [pauses] uh... [00:02:13]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Uhhh, [pauses for five seconds] — I'm just looking at your shoulder. [Chuckles]
[Silence for 20 seconds]
THERAPIST: I feel like it has been a while since you got lost <i>that</i> way here [pauses] or have noticed...
CLIENT: Yeah, well, I've usually, um — I just don't look at you. [Chuckles] Sorry. Um, [pauses]... [00:03:02]
THERAPIST: So we're being different mentally (ph), [pauses] or did you stop stopping yourself?
[Loud beep sounds]
THERAPIST: Oh, and now we ran out of time. [Sound of something sliding] [Eight, five, four, three, two] (ph) [sliding sound continues] Just ignore it. (ph).
CLIENT: Um, [pauses] [hits something] I don't know — the kabbalah [pauses], um, the pause perhaps, um [pauses for six seconds] — I mean [fidgets]...
[Loud been sounds again]
CLIENT: Yeah, [inaudible at 03:49] [I don't know] (ph) [Pauses for 14 seconds]
[Loud beep sounds a third time]
THERAPIST: [I'll see you tomorrow] (ph)
[Sliding sound, recording ends]
