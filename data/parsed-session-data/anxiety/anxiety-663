<i>May 1992. I open a small gray box containing the new</i>
pair of southwestern-style earrings I bought in anticipation of this day.
They're oval, outlined in silver, embedded with red and black stones.
Black for power; red for anger. It has been two years since Mom's
death, and there is so much to be angry about.


I am still crying gut-wrenching tears after orgasm, and I've been
plagued with flashbacks. I tell Mary Anne I feel like I'm living with
time bombs inside my head; we discuss the option of including hypnosis
in my treatment. Thus begins the phase of incest recovery I think
of as major surgery, with our relationship as the anesthesia, and hypnosis
as the knife. I continue with individual sessions weekly, keeping
notes on nightmares, blips of memory, and full-blown flashbacks that
intrude into my daily life, so that I can explore them further under
hypnosis at intervals Mary Anne and I agree on. I also join a support
group for incest survivors that meets weekly in Atlanta.


Peter travels with me to Macon on hypnosis days, and though
neither of us has been inclined to pray the rosary as adults, he sits
in Mercer Medical School's library and prays with Mom's old rosary

Mary Anne and I return to her office for debriefing after hypnosis,
before Peter drives me home. The day is long, expensive, and
arduous. The process of retrieving repressed memories is like putting
together pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece builds on those around
it, but because each piece is laden with feelings--fear, horror, dread,
anger, sadness, relief--the emotional fallout is difficult to manage. I've
restructured my professional life, reducing my client load to less than
half the usual. I've been consulting with a psychiatrist well versed in
the nuances of trauma recovery for supervision of my clinical work,
and I've developed a consultation group with three colleagues who,
like myself, are committed to examining how our personal lives affect
our clinical work and vice versa. All of these choices have helped
prepare me for this day.


"Hey, Cath!" Peter calls from downstairs. "We don't need to leave
for another half hour, but I just want you to know I'm home. Meet
you down here when you're ready!"


"Okay.... Thanks, Peter!" I call as I open the dresser drawer,
pull out a black bra and black T-shirt, and put them on. Next, I need
a strong symbol of Christ--something to remind me of the power of
good over evil, something to remind Dad of my faith in God.


My faith has grown in ways I could never have predicted. And
who would have ever thought that I would leave the Catholic church,
where as a child I found strength and hope? But once I learned that
incest is most common in patriarchal systems, it became impossible to
participate without either feeling guilty about being part of a process
that breeds abuse or becoming enraged by the church's oppression of
women in the name of God.


I hunt through my jewelry box and find a three-inch-long rustic
silver crucifix on a chain of quarter-inch links. Peter and I received it
when we gave a talk on commitment at a college student retreat in
Auburn years ago. I pull it over the black T-shirt and admire my reflection

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Self-talk isn't enough. I dig through a pile of books by my nightstand,
looking for <i>Journeys by Heart: A Christology of Erotic Power</i> by
Rita Nakashima Brock, then flip it open to a favorite line and read
aloud: "Anger is a key to both love and nonviolence, and it is pivotal
to self-affirmation and liberation. It is the healthy response of a self
to violation and a crucial avenue to self-acceptance and acceptance of
others."


This passage speaks strongly to me. I've been plagued with self-contempt
for as long as I can remember, and I tend to be perfectionistic
and judgmental of others. Furthermore, every emerging memory
of Dad's abuse seems to feed my dislike of Peter. He joined a partnersof-survivors
support group and decided to protect me from having to
deal with Dad directly--handling all phone calls and taking him to
the doctor when necessary--and gives me his unswerving dedication,
driving me to Macon and praying for me. Yet <i>anything</i> about him that
resembles Dad--his corny sense of humor, lack of awareness about <i>his</i>
personality flaws, his dependence on me, even his love--fills me with
disdain. And there are months when I cannot stand the sight of his penis.
In fact, lately, I've been experiencing erotic longings for women.


<i>Why? Is it an unconscious wish to love my own body back, or to find
out just what it was that Dad enjoyed so much? Maybe my psyche is working
hard to protect me from being promiscuous with men.... Part of me
wants to fuck them all, use them to act out my rage at Dad</i>.


Our bed is a mess. I lean over, pulling the covers back and smoothing
the fitted sheet, then pull the top sheet up, shake out the blanket,
and tuck it under the mattress at the foot of the bed. <i>And just because I
can't bear having sex with Peter, that doesn't mean I don't get horny</i>.


Easing the blanket over the top sheet, I run my hands along its
surface, until the ripples disappear. <i>I yearn to have sex with someone,
anyone with whom I have no history.... Is that why I'm attracted to
women now</i>? Sometimes I imagine going to a lesbian bar, just to find
someone to try it with.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I reach for the pillows, fluff them up, and place them beside each
other. <i>Think of the people who could get hurt... Peter, our children, the
woman I'd be using. Besides, I'm a therapist.... I know part of me is
regressed to the ages of abuse... too young to be having sex. Why reabuse
myself</i>


I stand back; the bed is made. Rays of sunlight dance across our
pillows. <i>Will we ever get beyond all this sexual pain?</i>


"You about ready, Cath?" Peter's halfway up the stairs. "It's getting
to be time!"


"I'll be down in a few minutes!"


"Okay, I'll wait for you in the car!"


Bending to put my panties on, I remember how often my father
took them off. <i>You will be safe today,</i> I assure my vagina as I pull on
black bikini underwear. Next, I slip into black knee-highs and black
jeans, and hunt through clutter on my closet floor for black boot-shoes:
the finishing touch to the vestments of my day. I am now a priestess,
schooled in the private seminary of prayer, reflection, study, and psychotherapy,
and I will go about the business of exorcising demons.


Dad is now out of the psychiatric ward and living back in Atherton,
the facility where we originally moved him and Mom, but in the
personal care section. I've alerted the director about my plans to meet
with him and asked her if she'd keep an eye on him after we leave. I
also made an appointment with his psychiatrist, so that I could inform
him of the details of my plans in case Dad has some kind of
breakdown afterward. I asked for his opinion about the likelihood
of Dad becoming violent in response to our visit, but his psychiatrist
was positive that wouldn't happen. "Your father is a weak old man,
Catherine," he said. "And he's taking medication--he might become
upset, but he won't get dangerous. Those days are over. But I suspect
he'll deny everything... I hope you're prepared for that."


I think I am. I insert the earrings into my pierced ears, admiring
their reflection in the mirror, then pause and make the sign of the
cross. Today I will meet the source of my heartache. Speak my truth to
my father. Look him in the eye and give voice to my agony.

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>"Come right in, sweetheart," Dad says as he opens the door</i>.
He leans forward to kiss me. I flinch.


"I would prefer that you not touch me today," I say, sickened
by the stale stench of his flesh. I look for Peter, who had gone to
Dad's room first and told him I'd soon be visiting him with my therapist.
Mary Anne and I had arrived twenty minutes later. Our plan is
that Peter will restrain Dad should his psychiatrist's prediction prove
wrong. Peter stands next to the window opposite us, his arms draped
over Mom's old crewel-upholstered, wing-back chair.


"Yes, of course, dear," Dad says when I refuse his kiss. I wonder
if he suspects our agenda.


"Please, have a seat." He points to the purple-velvet-upholstered
Victorian couch that had been in Ammy's living room until she died,
the one that Mom inherited.


"Yes, thank you," I say. "We'll sit down. But first I'd like you to
meet my therapist of the last thirteen years, Mary Anne Armour."


"Yes, how do?" Dad asks, shaking Mary Anne's hand just as he
once greeted patients in his waiting room.


His current home is one bedroom with an adjoining bathroom.
To the right of the door, on a wall unit Peter and I bought at
Kmart, is Dad's Fisher stereo unit, radio, and turntable, several old
records, and some books. Among those, I see the copy of Anne Morrow
Lindbergh's <i>Gifts from the Sea</i> that I'd given Mom for Mother's
Day 1989, plus an ornate leather-bound German Bible that was his
great-grandmother's. Beside the wall unit is a framed papal blessing
from Pope Pius XI. Next to Dad's twin bed, on Ammy's old night
table, are an old lamp and a telephone. But the night table's finish
is warped from years of Mom and Dad's spilling drinks they never
bothered to clean up.


I wonder if my sensitivity to the details of the room is a form of
dissociation, an avenue away from my anxiety. I'm ready to confront
Dad, but I'm terrified. Not so much of speaking as of what might happen
later. Will a wall in my unconscious come tumbling down? Will a
dam break, spilling even more wretched memories into awareness?

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary Anne and I sit on the couch, which gives forth a musty
mixture of alcohol and cigarette smoke. <i>Though Mom's dead, their history
lives on in the upholstery</i>. I turn to look at Mary Anne.


"This was my grandmother's," I whisper.


"Ammy's?" she whispers back.


"Yes. It's comforting, sitting on it. Feels as if she's with us."


Mary Anne takes my hand and squeezes it. "I know that helps."


"Well, to what do I owe this glorious occasion?" Dad asks, looking
at Mary Anne. "Catherine hasn't visited me for such a long time."


"I haven't been to visit you because I've been struggling with
some very difficult things," I say, intercepting his detour attempt.
Then I try to appeal to his love of medicine. "It's sort of like a person
with cancer. Like I have a melanoma threatening to destroy the
healthy cells of my body, and so I'm in treatment, to rid my body of
the disease."


"Oh, is that so, sweetheart? I'm sorry to hear that, dear." His
tone is sarcastic as he leans back in Mom's chair, the same chair Peter
is standing behind, and crosses his legs. He wears black penny loafers
and black socks, a pair of gray flannel slacks, a white Dacron drip-dry
shirt with a soiled red foulard bow tie, and the black, white, and
red hound's-tooth check sports jacket he's had for over thirty years.
The wool has thinned and the cuffs are frayed, but he's often said he
thought he looked dapper in it. I'm struck by the fact that he and I
have on the same colors, red and black, and I wonder if he dressed
this way after learning from Peter that I was coming, or if it's typical
for him to wear these winter clothes in the middle of May. He looks
hot and pale, but younger than his eighty-one years.


"I've come to tell you about some events I remember happening
when I was a child," I say. Mary Anne's warm fingers squeeze my hand.


"Is that so? Well, carry on then, dear. I imagine this is quite difficult
for you, and as your father, of course I would want to help you in
any way I could." He says this in a monotone, as if reading something
he's not at all interested in.

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I speak in the clear, calm voice I had hoped for, listing the incidents
I'd reported to his psychiatrist: molesting me by the piano as a
child, the first rape at age ten, fondling my breasts in the middle of the
night after I got my first bra, and raping me in the guise of teaching
the facts of life while holding a knife to my throat. Dad watches me
without interrupting.


"I have felt devastated by these events, Dad," I finish. "I am so
angry at you, and I am so hurt. <i>How</i> could you do those things to
me?" My voice quivers and my eyes fill with tears.


He turns away from me, directing his words to Mary Anne. "Obviously,
my daughter is crazy. This, I am sure, is very clear to you.
Something is seriously wrong with Catherine's mind, and I suspect
this has been true for a very long time."


"No," Mary Anne says. "I know Cathy very well. Cathy is <i>not</i>
crazy. I can assure you of that, Doctor Graham. In fact, she has remarkable
psychological strength. And she's talking to you about her
pain. I see this is difficult for you to hear, but it's true."


"Oh, I see what you're saying," he says, taking his glasses off and
chewing on the end of the earpiece while he glances up and down
across the room. "Hmm... well, I can tell you that yes, Catherine's
mother was in the hospital for a long time when she was ten. And yes,
Catherine did everything her mother did not do."


<i>Bingo</i>.


"But she enjoyed it. You enjoyed every minute of it, Catherine
Girl," he adds, turning his attention to me.


"What? I did not!"


"Well, you certainly never complained." He shifts his eyes back to
Mary Anne. "Catherine was a very capable, very remarkable child. She
cooked, did dishes, pots, pans, laundry, kept an eye on the younger
ones, and never complained. She was eager to please. I had no idea
it bothered her to have so much responsibility. Cate wondered sometimes
if we were expecting too much of her, but Catherine always said
she <i>wanted</i> to help out."

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And what about the rapes? What about the way you touched my
breasts?" It is all I can get out. I am turning numb.


"That's out of the question, dear heart," he says. "It never happened.
And I'm sorry you're in so much distress that you would dream
up such utter nonsense. Obviously some kind of craziness has gotten
into your head."


"I have to go now." I stand and motion for Mary Anne to follow
me. To Dad I say, "I've had enough. Goodbye, Dad."


I walk toward the door, with Peter and Mary Anne close behind.


"Well, dear, I'm so sorry you have to leave so soon, but I understand,
sweetheart. I hope you are well again someday, dear heart." His
tone is still sarcastic.


Peter goes to tell the director we're leaving, and I walk Mary Anne
to her car. I feel raw, raped again, except for one very important factor.
This time I have an advocate: Mary Anne.


<i>Peter and I spend the weekend trying to comfort each other</i>.
Meanwhile, the director calls to report that Dad's doing fine. He had
told her that the reason I hadn't been visiting was because I had cancer,
and that in all likelihood I wouldn't be coming anymore because I was
very ill and would be undergoing treatment.


On the evening of Father's Day 1992, Paul calls.


"What did you <i>do?</i>"His agitated voice comes over the line without
even a "Hi, Cath, how are you?"


"What do you mean? What are you talking about?"


"You know what I mean, Cath. I just got off the phone with Dad,
and he sounds so upset. He said you arrived with your therapist and
you accused him of sexually abusing you."


"That's true, Paul, I did. But I also alerted his caregivers so they
could give him any support he might need. I didn't do it in a cruel
way."


"How could you? He's so upset."


"Paul, why are you acting this way? Why are you turning on me?"

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Because you turned on our father!"


I feel spit upon by the one relative I thought I could rely on. I
think about the incest survivors in my support group, and the ones
I've treated in therapy over the years: This is consistent with their experiences.
I remind myself that my family had been organized around
keeping these secrets for decades, and we children were brainwashed
to believe Dad was entitled to never have to be accountable for inflicting
pain on our family. Just because I'm ready to change the family
rules doesn't mean I can expect Paul to be ready. I cry, hard, feeling
as if I'm in the middle of a nightmare. And then I hear Paul crying,
and he speaks.


"I'm sorry, Cath. I'm <i>so</i> sorry. Here you are, my sister, and I love
you so much. But he's my father, and I love him too. And he's an old
man, a widower. And I'm so confused. I can't <i>imagine</i> him doing those
things. It's just too much. I'm sorry. I want to be supportive. I really
do. I just don't have the emotional stamina tonight. I'll call you back
in a couple of weeks."


It's difficult to absorb his words. They fracture my trust in him,
and stir up tidal waves of grief. Wasn't he the brother who had told me
he witnessed our father giving me an abortion? Hadn't he already acknowledged
that the incest memories I shared with him had triggered
more of his own memories?


I hang up, feeling as if I'm releasing the last of my hopes to ever
be understood by the people I grew up with. All of them... even
Paul... are deserting me in recovery, just as they were absent during
the most excruciating events of my childhood.
