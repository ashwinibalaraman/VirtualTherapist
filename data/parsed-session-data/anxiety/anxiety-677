“Whoever injures a man,<br />
Binds all men to resistance.”--Dr. CHANNING.


One day I saw a woman in a room adjacent to my own, who
was a melancholic, sitting on the bare floor, sewing for the
'workroom,” and looking extremly dejected and hopeless.
[spoke to her, in the way I usually did to such, and coming
quite near her, discovered that she had only one garment on.
[t was a very clean pink calico dress, and her naked feet
were drawn up under her body, closely as possible, trying to
get a little warmth. It was late in the season, and the
weather cold and damp. I asked her why she did not wear
suitable clothing. She replied, with great meekness, “they
do not give it to me, and I don't know as I ought to ask for
it.” I then asked her, why she sat on the cold floor, being

I stepped into my own room, and brought my chair, offering
to lend it. She objected, not wishing “to rob” me. “Oh,
as to robbery,” I replied, “I have no robbery to complain of;
I am excused from working for the Institution, while it seems
that you are not. I am better clothed, and don't need a
chair so much as you do, for when I wish to sew or write,
I can sit upon my bed.” With evident reluctance, she at
last accepted the loan of my chair. “Now you are not a cat,
but a woman,” said I, “sit up in a chair then, like a woman,
and I will try to have them get your clothing for you.”


This lady Mrs. Gleason, of Chicago, was one of those
extremely humble ones, who will give up their rights, because
they feel unworthy to enjoy them. On looking at her
head, I discovered a very obvious necessity for a comb.


“Why dont you comb your head? I think it might be
useful.”


“Do you think it is right to kill any thing that lives?”
faintly interrogated this almost crushed-to-death victim.”


“I think,” replied I, “that if my head had become a pasture
for such animals, I should kill them, soon as possible,
without stopping to discuss the moral considerations.” I
said this with such a peculiar air and tone, that, in spite of
herself, she actually stopped sewing, looked up from her
work and half laughed. “Reason is not quite dead here,
but it is evidently a good deal sick I” was my reflection.


I reported her condition to her attendants, but had reason
to repent having done so, as I was told it was “no business”
of mine. I replied that, “it did not appear to be the business
of any one to take care of Mrs. Gleason, as no one attended
to her except to set her to work, and I never could see the
defenceless suffer, without trying to defend them.”


One day I walked out, and by especial liberty, plucked a
few flowers to carry to my room. On passing a window of
the gentleman's “lower ward,” I saw a pale gray-haired aged

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Yes father, do you never go out in the fresh air and get
flowers!”


“No,” he replied sadly.


What kind of a conscience, queried I, has he who thus
can deprive an aged afflicted man from God's free gifts of air
and the unbarred light of heaven? One too, whose “tedious
days and nights of grief,” are to be spent, like those of a
criminal, within bolts and bars and prison walls? But no
thought of this kind was expressed by me to him, but I cheerfully
gave him all my flowers. His look of joy and surprise,
as tears glistened in his aged eyes, I shall never forget! His
fervent ejaculation, “God bless you!” was answered on
the spot; for I was more happy thus to afford one gleam of
joy to the lonely heart of this pale sufferer, than if a shower
of golden coins had fallen on my path for my possession.


But again I had transgressed; again had been minding,
I cannot say other people's since it was not other people's
business; had it been so, I should not have made it mine.


Leaving my aged friend in rapture over his flowers, I hurried
back to my hall. But I could not smother the boiling
indignation with which I thought over this scene. I soon
saw our protectress Mrs. Packard, at tea, and told her all
about it. She said little, but from her intelligent eyes, I inferred
that she thought I had gone too far for my own safety,
in my demonstrations of sympathy for others. She was right;
she knew better than I did, how far it would do to provoke
our Superintendent by showing mercy to his suffering victims.


My health declined more rapidly here, than in the Seventh
ward. It was impossible to have any refreshing sleep in the
midst of so much noise, and in the sight of so much misery.
My anxiety also increased to agony, as now a long time had
elapsed since I had heard from home. I entreated Mrs. McFarland

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1004212736-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

“Great God! what did I hear? Is it possible that a woman
can thus treat my reasonable anxiety; has she no sympathy
for my distress of mind? Will she punish me for the
spontaneous expression of this suffering, by putting me down
still lower in these gradations of torture? Can she think I
do not suffer sufficiently in the maniac's ward?


The expression “going down,” here means something well
understood by negro slaves a few years since, who were sent
“<i>down South</i> to Georgia.”


Mrs. McFarland after this inhuman response to my entreaties,
very suddenly rose and walked to the door. Before
she had time to unlock it, I had quietly followed her, for seeing
her still unrelenting, I could not restrain my weeping; it
burst out in spite of myself. I promised the most perfect
obedience to her own and the Doctor's slightest request of
me so long as I remained, if she would persuade him to let
me send just one letter home. I told her they might both
read my letter, and they should see that I would not find
fault or reproach them, &amp;c.; But she deigned no more replies,
but pushed through the door slamming it heavily into
my face, I sank powerless on the floor, in unutterable, silent,
intense agony.
