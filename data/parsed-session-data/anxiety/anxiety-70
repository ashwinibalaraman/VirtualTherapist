BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: I'm good. Thanks for rescheduling this week.
COUNSELOR: Oh, no problem. I appreciate you actually calling and letting me know.
CLIENT: I knew if I tried to come here that day I would have been like, on my last nerve because...
COUNSELOR: It was a rough day for you?
CLIENT: Well I have to get money to bring to my clients every week. And I'm supposed to get it Monday evening.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But my office hasn't been giving it to me until Tuesday evening. So my whole schedule relies on me giving those people money on Tuesdays. And since I always give it to them on Tuesdays, two of those people I prepare their medications if I don't go to see them then, no medications and no food.
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: So...I knew because of the holidays that the banks were closed on Monday and I wouldn't get the money probably until Tuesday night. And they would still want to see me, so...
COUNSELOR: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: It wasn't too bad. But I was glad I just didn't have to worry like about getting here. So...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Okay. Well how have things been going?
CLIENT: Okay. I just realized when I was coming here that you know you had said that I should stick more with how my feelings are than worrying about what - how other people will perceive me. And it's been tough. Like it's still hard for me to not be cheery with my clients because a lot of them are so impressionable by what mood you're in.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But today, I've inviting Tony to tell me what we're going to do - what days he can take off for the holidays because we're having this big family reunion. And my mom's like well, does he not want to come? And I said it's not that he doesn't want to come but this construction at our house is supposed to happen and I think he's worried about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So he was away all last week. I had a girlfriend stay with me and we had like a really good time. And when he came back on Sunday I said let's talk about this. What dates do you want to go so I can buy a ticket? And he didn't want to talk about it. He changed the subject. He's like, I don't know. And I said if you don't tell me the dates I'm just going to buy tickets. And I had known that he had told his friend in Florida that he wants to see them for Christmas. And we're going to Florida for the reunion. So I called him today and I said well, I found a ticket, you know pretty good price nonstop and the dates are from like the 23rd to the 2nd. And he paused and he's like, that's ten days, I thought we agreed that we're only going for three or five days. And I said well, we didn't really agree on anything because you and I didn't talk about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I said I have to be there for Christmas for the reunion and you made plans to see somebody on New Year's. So that leaves us with ten days. And he - and I said you know I want to be there for Christmas and he's like well, I guess it must be only my house. And I said well I have no idea if we were supposed to start construction. I said do you have a date? And he said they're supposed to start on the 1st. And I said well I have no problem with not being there for New Year's but I guess then I'm just confused because I have to be there for Christmas for the reunion.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And you want to be there to see your friend which - and then we have to be back to do the you know...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And this time I'd like taken a deep breath and like was really calm like as if I was at work and just talked to him through how I was feeling about the thing to better understand where he was coming from (2:57).
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And we ended up not getting in an argument and I said well, you know, do these dates seem right for you? Let me just confirm with my family what dates are good for us so we - we're going to Miami as well.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I talked to my mom and she said are you upset? And I said well I'm upset because I've been trying to get this answer for a couple weeks and he doesn't tell me, and then he's upset that it's not the way he wants.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But she said you know, ten days is a lot of time to spend at anybody's house. So it wasn't a big deal and when I called him I said you know these are the dates that I'm thinking that we should probably leave. I don't mind telling your friend that we're not going to spend New Year's with him. And he's like better we use my frequent flier miles. And I'm frustrated because he could have just - we could have just talked about that on Sunday and saved myself the time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But I was proud of myself for not getting that, you know that feeling that you just, like when I can't explain what I'm thinking.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Can you say a little more about what that experience was like for you? To not - I guess what you're saying is not getting confused and - what was it like?
CLIENT: Well I didn't even realize that I hadn't, like until I was thinking back about coming here and I was like you know, I didn't - I think that he started with it, I just took a - I just remember taking a deep breath, and I was at work so I knew I couldn't get upset.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I just talked him through, and I sounded very like businesslike, I felt. But it was the best way for me to express where I was coming from. You know? In terms of like what my feelings were on the situation. And it felt good, you know to get off the phone and not be upset and you know, feel a little like frustrated like he's not - that we could have avoided in the beginning.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But I didn't leave that conversation feeling like upset or hurt or personal - like I did something wrong.
COUNSELOR: Can you think back to the - when you were actually in it, like in the moment of trying to talk with him? What was it like for you?
CLIENT: I was very focused.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I just remember being really focused and being able to, you know, the words were just coming and that was exactly what I would have said and it was happening. You know I said you know while I understand what you're saying it doesn't make sense to me because you, you know really want to be here for - you said to your buddy you want to be there for Christmas and I have no problem coming back early and these are the dates that I have to be there and um...
COUNSELOR: So those are the things you were saying as you - you identify liking what sort of feelings were going on for you as you were talking?
CLIENT: Well I was angry because he was like, well that's ten days. We can't go for ten days.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because all I kept thinking was that he hadn't - that I had tried to talk about it and it hadn't happened.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But when I was addressing what my thoughts were on it, I just remember being like so targeted, I mean I was sitting at my desk, I was on the phone and just saying everything, you know that I was thinking. And not having trouble knowing what I was thinking.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know what - if that's what you're asking.
COUNSELOR: Well I'm wondering about, as you're in the moment you're feeling kind of angry with him and you're trying to let him know what you're you know understanding the situation is. What was it like for you experientially just in terms of what you were feeling in your body, what were you feeling emotionally, as you were talking with him about this (6:05)?
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Did you notice any kind of shift for you, any changes?
CLIENT: I just remember taking a deep breath and just saying, you know, kind of sounding like a little stern. Like...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And being upset but not being - I mean I was angry and I knew I was angry and I was able to express that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't - I mean personality, I mean I was just sitting at my desk, I wasn't like - usually when I'm on the phone I'm like fishing or whatever. And I was just staying, like staring at the phone and just talking to him, you know, as if he was maybe in front of me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So you were actually on the phone with him, he wasn't in the room with you?
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Did that help at all, having him not be present in the room? Or....
CLIENT: I think probably.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I think that sometimes with him just staring at me, angry, like he does this thing where he rolls his eyes or he like, he like, whatever. You know? And that bothers me. And a lot of times when somebody's just staring at me, I can't, you know. Maybe. But he's also the same way. Like if he's coming home, we'll have like a great conversation. And he'll walk in the door and we cannot communicate. I told him for Thanksgiving to go in the car and call me so we could have like a nice talk.
COUNSELOR: Well it's good that you have a sense of humor about it.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah. Because we were talking about what were we going to do for Thanksgiving. Like you know, we should have a talk, so go in the car and call me because we always have better conversations that way. But I don't know if - I mean I was ready to talk about it on Sunday as well.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know I brought it up. I knew that it was a point of contention. I couldn't figure out why, you know if you had plans on the 1st, it was the first I was hearing about it. And I told him, you know like, you have to be there for New Year's and you have to be there for Christmas. And it sounds to me like he must not even have been listening to me, you know in the first place. It wasn't like he was busy watching a game or anything.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know so maybe the fact that I had already thought about it to begin with when that situation arose, I already knew what I wanted to say. But I was still impressed. Like everything that I really wanted to say, it just came out.
COUNSELOR: So you surprised yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And it - not surprised like I hung up the phone and I was like, wow that was really great. But like I felt - 
COUNSELOR: What did you think?
CLIENT: - relieved, like that I was able to tell him everything I was thinking. And when I talked to my mom I think I was a little shaky, and like my voice was quivering a little bit.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But then she was like, you know it's understandable that somebody would not be - want to be away that long. And I could explain to her that it wasn't the he didn't want to spend time with the family.
COUNSELOR: Can you say more about your voice quivering?
CLIENT: As if like if I was about to cry, you know?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You get like all choked up.
COUNSELOR: Is that what was going on for you or...?
CLIENT: Not on my phone call with Tony, but when my mom said, are you upset? Are you okay?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Then I was like, well yeah, I'm okay, and I got a little quivery and then I said you know, I think she asked me is it not - he doesn't want to spend time with my family? And I said it's not that.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know, I don't - but he's so, he's always like that. When it comes to going away and he like - even with the dentist. You would think it was the worst think, you know. It happened with our honeymoon, I had to beg and beg him, and I can't go and I can't do this date and I'm coming back early (9:00). And then he goes and has a really good time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So what's that like for you? I mean this was a kind of thing you do often with him. It sounds like it's...
CLIENT: I think what I mean at the time of the honeymoon I was persistent. And when he said well, I don't know if I'm going to go, I said then I'll take somebody else. Because I'm going. This is something I want to do. And then when we were there, he's like I'm going to use the Internet, I'm going to work. And I had tried to justify that it was Christmas and nobody was going to be working anyway, and he just didn't want to believe me until we got there. And then he paid for the Internet access for the whole trip and didn't even use the Internet.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know in the last week that we were gone. It's frustrating because I - he - if he could explain to me why he doesn't want to go or why it's like you know when he said the thing about the contractor coming on the 1st. If I had known that you know it would have saved everybody time.
COUNSELOR: And what was it like for you after having you know sort of asserted yourself and made your point? Talking with your husband afterwards, what was that like?
CLIENT: It was fine. Like both of our voices went back to normal and - and because I was saying well, this is what I thought and if you don't think that this is you know what we're going to do, does this sound like a better suggestion to you? And then I called my mom and found out the dates and called him right back. I said well, these are the dates that we have plans. I think that we should leave on Sunday and come back on Saturday. It's really up to you if you want to leave Friday or Saturday but these are the reasons why I think we should leave on Saturday. And he looked at the calendar and he's like, okay, that's fine. And I said, great. And then I said, you know, I have two weeks off. Do you want me to - we can talk about later if you want me to stay home when the work starts.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But it was fine. I mean I think it could have potentially been a big argument.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It was still like a little argument but not - not what it could have been.
COUNSELOR: Well at the beginning of the session today you started out saying how you've tried to be more I guess, yourself or just not being a particular way because you, you know the people you work with you know reply. And that it's hard for you. Can you say a little bit more about that?
CLIENT: Yeah, I mean - and you know what, you had said you know that - well I'll tell you what happened. Okay, I have that client John. And he, you know, he's been talking about me to other people that I have on the case.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Who tell me. Of course they probably shouldn't tell me, but I still take it personally, and I talked to him on Friday. And I said John, is there anything you want to tell me? Am I doing something that makes you uncomfortable? He said no. And I said John, anytime you do something to me I always tell you. Do you want to tell me anything? And then he felt like a little cornered, and he was like, well what is it that you want me to say? And I said I want you to say what's bothering you because I think that you and I respect each other enough to do that. And just pointing out that he has consistently broken his relationships with people that try and help him.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And maybe I was a little emotional, not in the sense of like crying but like very focused on you know addressing this, and not letting up when I probably should have (12:02). But then he went home and he was, all weekend like crazy complaining about me to like everybody. I got so many calls, they're like what is wrong with him? And I was like, I don't know. So I did my normal like, call and check up on him because he's also on this medication that makes him very anxious. And on Monday I called him when I had time to talk and I just, you know, checked up on him. And I said this is what I'm doing. And he said, you know, what our conversation on Friday made me very uncomfortable. You told me that I ruin all the relationships in my life. And I said John, that's not what I said. I said that there is a trend because you are so impatient about accepting other peoples' flaws. I mean his flaws are like, somebody looked at him funny, and somebody bought him chocolate cake instead of vanilla. You know, they're not like big things. And then he said, you know that he thought I was yelling at him. And I said I'm sorry if you thought that. I really didn't mean to yell at you and I feel bad that your feelings were hurt but I thought that we needed to address it. And you're doing right now what I wanted us to do on Friday. You know? And was like [indiscernible]. But I did what I wanted to on Friday. And it was the result of like totally opposite results as what I would have wanted. You know? Which is why usually I don't address those things or don't - 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: - with my clients. You know, like, I saw my client today that got out of the hospital and I was like, tired and I was running late and I you know was like really cheery and really supportive that she was home. And I think you did a really good job and you know don't worry about this. And there's another client who is writing checks for like, anything and everything. And I had to like, you know, take her mail when she wasn't looking. And she couldn't remember the date, she asked me like ten times because she kept reading this piece of mail dated last month and obsessing over it. And I had to like, be cheery and keep reminding her because she has no idea that she asked me ten times before.
COUNSELOR: Can you say a little more about that, you know, having to be cheery? What - what that's about?
CLIENT: It's usually not too hard with most of my clients. The woman that got out of the hospital was easy. With John it's really hard because things he says are so different, you know? Like he has no money right now which is why a lot of this anxiety is coming because he gets a Social Security check every month.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And he spent it all. And he went into this long story about how his mother has a stroke, he doesn't want her to just linger around and what is he going to do if she - if he needs to go there right away? And I said well, I think you should talk about your feelings about your mother with your therapist.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And in terms of money, and needing money in case of an emergency, I will help you with that. I will never say no to you if something happens to your mother. And I will help you get on the plane, I will give you whatever money it is for your stay, your food. You really don't have to worry about that. But it took like a half hour. You know and then the whole thing about that guy who looked at him funny. And then he told me that he doesn't want to wait for the JAVA van because people on the street, men see him as vulnerable and want to have sex with him, and if he was ever alone on the street they would want to take advantage of him. And I said well, I think that's another thing you should talk to your therapist about because it's his neighborhood (15:03). And while - I said I wasn't there John, I don't know what kind of looks you got so I'm not saying you're wrong. I don't think that that's an area that I can really help you with.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Which is new for me. I used to always just listen and try to mix everything in. I really just don't have the expertise to deal with that kind of stuff. But it's hard to sit there and listen to it, you know? I got a call from him and he said that - afraid his aide is going to take the grocery money and buy her family food. But it took him 20 minutes to explain, something about there are three hamburgers and two other people want hamburger - I was like, are you trying to say that you're afraid she's going to take the money? But it's hard to be cheery. I mean they are so sensitive, a lot of my clients, to the way I speak. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So if I sound irritated, he'll apologize, I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you, don't be upset with me. And I'll say I'm not upset with you, I'm upset that you're upset. You know you don't have to be concerned about those kind of things.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: That's my job. I'll worry about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But it's hard to do that with my clients.
COUNSELOR: So there's a part of you that feels like you need to be sort of cheery and smiling because otherwise then patients start to feel uncomfortable and...
CLIENT: And it makes my life easier too.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: If they're not uncomfortable then I don't have to deal with all the other things that happen.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Especially with a man like John. Most of my clients, it's easy. They're nice, we talk once a day oh, about how are you feeling?
COUNSELOR: So what about in terms of your personal life, your being able to be in whatever mood that you're in?
CLIENT: Well I've been focusing more on doing things with my friends. You know like when Tony was away I spent like five days with a girlfriend.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And all activities. And with Tony it's been - I've been being more myself but I still feel like I'm not that fun to be around because I'm, you know I'm tired or I'm frustrated or I'm angry. You know, when Tony got home at like 6 AM on Sunday and when we both got up, it was - I wanted him to unpack his suitcase. And there were clothes everywhere and he was like - he was going to watch football. And I said, no, no, no, no, come back here, you're going to help me go through this suitcase. And I was like where do you think this goes? And you know, like it was fine and he didn't get upset and he helped me do it. But it was the fact that like, can you just put your stuff away? Which is how I felt, he probably wouldn't have done it, you know. But I was like, laughing, I was like come on, I'll help you. Let's do this. Do you think that goes on the floor? And he just laughed and he's like, and he helped me. But when I say things in the way that probably I feel, he's very less responsive to doing those things.
COUNSELOR: So could you try and experiment here and say it as if he were in the room? Or how would you have wanted to have said it if he wouldn't take offense to it or feud about it?
CLIENT: What I would have said, which I have said in the past, it just didn't work, is like look, just please put your stuff away because you know, because I tell him to do it all the time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Or, like he called me last night and wanted food but I had been out with some friends, and it was like 10:00 at night. And he was like, what are you making for dinner? And I said, what are you making for dinner? I'm not going to bring you anything.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I was kind of joking but kind of like well, you know, there's so much food (18:02). Go out and buy a pizza. I really don't care but I have - you have the car and I have to take the subway. It's going to take me an hour and a half. And he was like, fine, if you, you know, he was fine about it.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Doing this when I got home.
COUNSELOR: And how are you about saying it. 
CLIENT: I was fine. Like I got off the phone and I was glad that I had said it because I don't need to worry about how - what am I going to bring home, I wasn't even hungry. You know? 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I'd been saying that more when he's hungry, I was like well, I'm not really hungry so these are some things that you can make.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And those are like an even balance. They're not like, mean and frustrated but they're not like, cheery, you know, what can I make you?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So it sounds like when, you know, when he had the suitcase there and you wanted him to put the stuff away, you  - 
CLIENT: I think I did first say, Tony can you put your stuff away. And then, no. Which is so, you know, like, [indiscernible] when somebody says no.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You can't force him, he's bigger than me. So then I went into this, you know joking like I dragged him by the shirt and I was like, come on, let's put the stuff away. I don't want to do it. I'm tired, or something.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So usually you would actually put the stuff away, or how would it work?
CLIENT: Actually, it would sit there for like three days. And then I would put it away because nobody did it. He'll like walk over it. Yeah, I mean, I can't remember the last time, that maturity. Like for him a big thing is like he brought up the laundry, you know, but it's still in the basket and it's still in the living room. You know so if I joke with him and I'm like, I throw the shirts at him and I'm like okay, fold these please, I'm going to put away the rest of the stuff, he'll do it. But if I'm like Tony, here, can you just help me with these please? He'll usually not.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. So what's that like for you having to sort of do things in a not so genuine way, it sounds like?
CLIENT: I think that the suitcase thing, it was fine because I mean, he did it and we were both in a good mood and we both got it done and then he got to do - go do his thing and I felt like relief that it happened. You know? It's frustrating to do that and then still not get the results I want. You know? And then I spent like a month just not caring and just kind of being like, you know can you do the dishes today? Or you know why don't you do this and not getting much of a reaction and then getting more upset. And then when it doesn't happen I'm sitting there fuming because  - 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: - it didn't happen. And then I'm like maybe I should have asked differently and, I don't know. But if I ask nicely he doesn't do it either. Then I get upset.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So...but I've been trying. It's still - I still catch myself maybe acting in a way that I don't think is genuine for me but, you know like, with Tony's family sometimes I'll go and sit in the hall.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Because when I'm not in the mood usually I'll just tell them you know like I'm just sleepy and not up to doing what they are. Just have Tony talk to them.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like it's really hard to kind of try to be more serious about the thing that you're asking for and not get a response that you'd like (21:02). And then to having to sort of change your approach in a way that doesn't fit so closely with how you're really feeling as a way of getting what you want to have happen. And it sounds like everyone was - the end result is that you know the clothes are put away or, you know, the - it seems like it's okay for you that you don't feel uncomfortable or badly about you know doing it any other way.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm. I mean I think the whole discussion about going on vacation on Sunday when I was really focused on having that conversation, I wasn't like super calm but I was like Tony, I really think we need to talk about this. Because I'm concerned about the tickets and to not get a reaction, I mean I was glad that I brought it up, you know but still frustrated that didn't happen.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I'm trying to be better with my mom on the phone too which is frustrating me to just say, I know that's all right. And you know instead of like, I already know, don't talk about it again! You know?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. To try and say it in a way that gets the message across but doesn't mean that you're being you know aggressive or verbally abusive in any way.
CLIENT: And then I'd have to feel guilty about what I said later.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: What's the word? Exasperated? Most of the time.
COUNSELOR: Most of the time you're feeling that way? Can you say a little bit more about that?
CLIENT: Yeah, with Tony when he doesn't - I mean I just, I've been telling, like trying to think of ways, I was like well maybe you know on Thanksgiving what do you think that we should do? You know what do you want to eat? You know this is what I'm thinking about planning. And I told him that now once a month instead of just waiting for him to tell me when he has time I'm just going to be scheduling things for us to do. Like, because my friend kept giving me - offering me tickets to "Stomp," and he's like oh, I don't know if I can go now, and I went with my friend and I had like the best time. And I thought, there's so many things in New York to do like that and I spend so much time just waiting for Tony to say well, I can go. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: If he can't go I'll just find somebody else but I can't just wait around for him. I don't know what his problem is about loving to just stay at home and watch TV.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Than have to communicate with anybody.
COUNSELOR: So you both have kind of different styles of what you enjoy or...?
CLIENT: I don't' think so. I mean when he goes out he has a really good time. I think there's something, and like I said when he goes on vacation he has a good time. It's something about committing to a certain time because something might come up and he doesn't want to do that, or having the control of deciding you know when he wants to do something. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm (23:59).
CLIENT: But I had so much fun when my friend was in town. We had - we went to dinner and then we went out, only for like a few hours, you know in the city. Whereas with Tony he's like I don't want to go out in the city. And I realize just because you go and have a few drinks doesn't mean you have to be out all hours of the night.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know and - and Jesse. I don't know why it is why Tony's not in town I always meet up with Jesse and Mario and stuff. But when he's home I lay on the couch with him all night.
COUNSELOR: So you were saying about feeling exasperated and just kind of feeling that way about trying to constantly get Tony to do things with you and that now you've decided you're just going to kind of do things on your own or with friends  - 
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: - if he's not going to...
CLIENT: Right like we have met people in New York that we can't maintain a friendship with because I'm so busy waiting for Tony to say - like I'll make plans and he's like, that's too late for me. I can't do it. That's too early. And once he couldn't go and I went out with my friends anyway and I guess they were just - well, that's happened a couple times. And yeah they're disappointed that he isn't there but I still have a good time.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't know. And he's - I think he's been somewhat better if I make friends to try and fit with his...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. To try to attend these events with you.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm. Because it's not like he's doing anything else. I mean he went to Idaho for this conference from Wednesday to Sunday. And Sunday I'm like, well tell me all about it. You know, and he's like, these are all the gifts I got. And I'm like, well what did you do there? He's like, I partied. Like, was there anybody I know there? And he's like, no. You know, and it's such like a forced conversation, and I looked and him and I was like, do you think we could at all possibly just talk about what happened this weekend? Like what kind of parties did you go to, did you speak on anything? And he's like yeah, I ran a session. I was the panel, I was leader of the panel but didn't speak, and nobody liked my panel. And I said well, why didn't they? You know and how did you like the conference overall? And...I don't know. And then he made some jokes about how there was dancing and there was a girl who liked him but he - everybody - and he showed them pictures of his wife. And that's like a joke with us, that he always likes to think that everybody's hitting on him, and if it were him to say that I'm sure that they were. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: That was - even if that happened, like I don't have doubts about his - I have no doubts about his faithfulness.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't think he's fun enough to have an affair. I can't even get him to leave the couch. And that was it but I couldn't figure out why it was so hard to - for him to tell me, you know I come back from somewhere and I want to tell everybody everything about what I did. You know?
COUNSELOR: It seems like you do have different styles in some ways of relating to other people and things that you find are important he doesn't seem to think they are important.
CLIENT: But he doesn't know that it's like this. And when he talks to his dad, you can't get that kid off the phone for like an hour, you know. And like just talking about whatever's on his mind. When we used to carpool a lot I would hear so much more about him. And for a long time I used to get upset because we'd get in the car, I'd say how was your day? Oh, blah. And he's like fine, nothing really happened (27:00). And he'd get on the phone and I'd hear all these things that happened, you know like so and so got laid off and so and so's having a baby, and this is what happened at work, blah, blah, blah. And he'll hang up and I'll look at him and I'm just like, you couldn't' have said any of those things to me when I asked you how your day was? And he's like - it happened so many times I finally just got off the phone and I was like why can't you just spend five minutes with me telling me first so that I don't feel like you don't want to tell me when you talk to your parents? Because otherwise then I'm going to be in a room with you every time you have a conversation with your parents...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know or his parents will tell him something like his grandmother's sick and he just won't tell me. And then they'll say, well didn't Tony tell you? And I'll say no, no.
COUNSELOR: It sounds like you feel left out a lot of time, that he sort of doesn't include you and doesn't think you're interested.
CLIENT: I don't really think that he doesn't think I'm interested, I think it's doesn't even occur to him. You know? And I've tried to bring it up with him. You know and like he says he's in therapy to talk about why he can't communicate with the people that are closest to him but - we could even talk about that, you know? I mean it's a big problem where if he didn't want to talk to me I wouldn't keep bugging him. And he then he wouldn't get upset that I would keep bugging him. So now I know that he's more willing to talk when somebody's not asking him to talk.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: It's very bizarre.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: We'll sit in the car and he'll be quiet for a little bit and then he'll start talking but still, I can't really get that to happen with him. And I told you the TV didn't work one day and we had like the best conversation and I was like, I'm just going to cancel our TV subscription.
COUNSELOR: No, I didn't hear about this.
CLIENT: Yeah, he was converting to digital cable and the - I had brought home the system but without the cord. And he's like, didn't you check for the cord? And he was upset but then he started laughing and I was like, I stood in line for two hours. Honestly, by the time they gave me something I flew home. I didn't really care, standing for that long. But we didn't have the cable and we were talking about all these different things and at the end I said, you know, I think that it's great to not have a TV, you know? Like we talk so much. And he laughs and he's like, we never can be without a TV again. And I said, that's not very fair.
COUNSELOR: Mmm.
CLIENT: But...I don't know. I went out with some of by best friends this week. I mean I think even if I figure out why Tony was the way he is or, you know, I have a creeping idea from his family or whatever that doesn't change the way he's behaving.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: You know? And I can only change so much too before something else has to give. 
COUNSELOR: [indiscernible]
CLIENT: I mean like I can only change so much of how I'm trying to approach it, you know and be here and talk about the issues that are bothering me, but if he doesn't change then it doesn't matter how much I try to make an effort. You know he has to make an effort too. Because I brought up going to couples' therapy because I felt maybe in that realm we could both examine the way that we are communicating and where the problems lie by - you know a third party (30:00). Or maybe I wouldn't be - get so anxious if I was confronted about something, you know. Because I think we keep talking about fear, and when I'm scared off. And maybe I would feel better if there was somebody else there? You know to talk about what's on my mind. But I've been trying to tell him. About what's - what's on my mind.
COUNSELOR: That sounded pretty tough for you to kind of say what you just said, that something's got to give. And you were kind of putting a lot of effort into trying to make things better and to communicate more practically where - it's kind of frustrating and it sounds like it's kind of scary sometimes.
CLIENT: Yeah, it is. Because what happens if he doesn't change, you know? 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I don't want to think about what would happen then because I can't live with somebody my whole life that's going to be that way. And I know he's not, which is why it's even more frustrating. I think if he had been like this the whole time I knew him, then it's like hard to change someone. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But if they're not like that and then changing something you don't like, that's more frustrating. Because you know what he's capable of.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know a lot of times, like when the house is done, and the house is done and I know he's worried about money and he's going to have to borrow money from his parents for the house and, I keep trying to take the pressure off him about that and - you know, but at the...I don't know. I don't know when he gets more money and when the house is done that it just won't be a pattern. You know?
COUNSELOR: That's when you're worried about?
CLIENT: Yeah because I think when I worked with him the pattern of the way in which he speaks to me happened then. But I couldn't address it every time it happened at work, you know. And now it just happens like normal passing, you know? Or maybe an accepting reason I use. So what if everything else in his life works out and that's just the way he's used to you know, like he's so used to not helping me do things around the house that he won't now. He has no feelings about feeling sorry for not doing those things, you know?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. Because he's used to you kind of taking...
CLIENT: Right. And like, you know taking out the garbage or raking, things that seem like more masculine responsibilities are things that he won't - I mean he helps me take the cans out but he won't take the garbage out unless I ask him, even if the garbage is overflowing. And if we come home and there's like a garbage can there, he will go into the house and I'll have to do it. And I think well, she just - that's something that I should do.
COUNSELOR: I think you know one of the things that you've talked about here before is you know your religious beliefs and just your own personal difficulties with talking about negative stuff having to do with you know people that you're close to. And I imagine it must be tough right now talking about Tony in this way, kind of you know saying this stuff about things that you're not happy with.
CLIENT: Probably, except I'm just at one of those moods where I'm just, it's really bothering me, you know (32:58). And weighing heavily on my mind because I raked all the leaves this weekend when he was gone. And you know we had the garbage out, and he knows that the garbage gets taken out and he was home last night. He could have just taken - there was like a bunch of leaves and stuff that had to be taken out. And this morning I said, well let's take them out. And we were doing it together but it made me think of all the times that we come home and I have to bring them back in or I have to take them out. And you know it's - it would be even more justified to me if he said that there's only certain things that he's going to do around the house, you know like the guy stuff. You know fix things and whatever, but for him, he doesn't feel like he has to do any of those things. You know?
COUNSELOR: As you talk I just get this feeling of you being like alone. I mean even though you're in a relationship it's sounding like a lot of times you feel like you're alone and having to constantly try to reach out to Tony and reconnect with him and connect with him. And that you're doing a lot of work with this.
CLIENT: I think so.
COUNSELOR: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess I've never thought of it as being alone but, yeah. Yeah, I mean I think that's why I'm so much more productive when he's not around, because I'm so used to doing it all, you know? 
COUNSELOR: So how does it help when he's not around?
CLIENT: I think part of me, when Tony's around and my desire to want to spend time with him, I will sacrifice the things I want to do to like, lay with him on the couch or, you know...
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: What are we going to eat, blah, blah, blah. You know I used to, when I worked with him just stay at the office late when I probably could have gone home, but just because you know I liked the car rides together or whatever just to spend time with him.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: But when he's not around I have no real reason to like lay in bed all day and feel lazy. And I get up and I do all the things I need to do, and I'll be super productive.
COUNSELOR: Mmm.
CLIENT: I think there's a part of me that when he's around I use it as an excuse to try and spend time with him, even if we're not talking at least we're together.
COUNSELOR: It's interesting that you said an excuse, it sounds like you really crave you know quality time with him. You really crave being able to connect with him. And so it makes sense to me that when he's around you actually want to be close to him.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: In whichever way that you can be. It sounds like there's also the key that it's not as satisfying as you'd like it to be. Yeah.
CLIENT: And I really think I could sit here and talk about how frustrated I am, you know, every day that we've met until our sessions are over. And unless he changes nothing is going to change, you know? I think when I originally came here I thought you know, I'm doing something wrong (38:59). But as we talk about it and as I just look at what's happening, I don't think that it is all my fault anymore. Which is hard.
COUNSELOR: I see you're getting emotional just talking about it.
CLIENT: But I'm not - I'm just more emotional because I'm frustrated, not because I'm really thinking about what will - what will happen if he doesn't change. You know? And I think deep down I think that it will change, I just don't know how long it's going to take. I don't know.
COUNSELOR: It's hard to talk about this today.
CLIENT: And I also, I'm annoyed about being more open about my feelings. I had a meeting with my boss because, well my former boss. I went in and said you know, I hear there was a position open in your department that's definitely what I'm doing. If it's still open I'd really like to talk to you about it. And she said well, it's not anymore but why? Are you thinking about making a change? And I said, I make probably, just a little bit more than our secretaries and then, if that's what I'm going to make then I'd rather have a job where I'm not required to be on my phone 24 hours, you know  - 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: - and exert myself the way I'm doing. She's like, how much do you make? And I told her. And she's like, oh my gosh, you need to talk to Tony, at work who is the supervisor of my current supervisor. So I set up a meeting with him. He's totally one of those people who's like super self-righteous, as is Margaret, my old boss and the other one. But at least during - she looks at me like her daughter.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: She's always been very motherly with me. Even though she likes to spout advice, I know her so I don't take everything she says literally. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I set up that appointment with Tony and Monday night I set up this thing for people at work for everybody to go out. So I was talking to one of the management staff and he's like you should definitely, you know, not be afraid to assert yourself on what your complaints are, and everyone just talking. So it was nice, like, a little pep talk. So I went in and Tony's like, I know why you're here. And I looked at him and I looked at my supervisor, I was like, you guys do? Because I had no idea how they would have known. I don't think that the guy I talked to would have said anything. And he's like, effective immediately you'll get your raise, the one I didn't get in June. Which was like 2 percent, which is really nothing. But just the principle that at least I got it. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And then, you know they went over - you know I said well, that's good but let me just tell you what's on my mind. I said I'm spending a lot of time on these clients and I'm just really not making the money that I think I should.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And if I'm going to make this little money I would like to stay here but not in this position, you know. It would be a lot easier for me to just work 9 to 5, you know and make the same amount of money. So they went through my cases and figured out what was wrong. Like I get paid only half of what I should get paid for John, but they haven't talked to the family so we had to do that (42:01). And a lot of my clients have just been around so long that they can't raise their fees. 
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I got clients from the old company where you just pay a certain amount a month no matter how much I work. Whereas most of the clients from the other company got per minutes in ten minute increments for the time that they work.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: So I'm making like half of what I should be making for the time that I spent. Which is nice to know but sad because everybody knew that I was struggling with these clients, I guess nobody ever bothered - and I told my supervisor that I wasn't making enough and she either not expressed it to Tony or whatever, forgot because she's busy. So we're making some changes. And then I came home and I told Tony - I told Tony that morning that I had a meeting with my boss. And I said, well, are you going to ask me? He's like, couldn't remember what he was supposed to ask me. And I said, about my meeting with my boss. And he said yeah, what happened? And I said, you know I got my raise. And he asked me how much? And he was like, that's not a raise. Are you getting - that's like $400 extra a year. And I was like well, it's a raise nonetheless.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And he said, you know why didn't you ask for more? And to be honest, I didn't even think about asking more. I had been - I had like an hour long meeting, we talked about a lot of things that were on my mind, and I know my job. I mean I knew it was commission based on the percentage of time I spent before.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: Or a percentage of how much money my clients pay anyway. I mean I didn't - I probably should have but I didn't. So, and I was like discouraged about that. Like I felt like I had to justify why I accepted such a low raise. And I was probably frustrated about it anyway but Tony just pointed it out. Then  - 
COUNSELOR: We actually need to wrap up for today. But if you want to finish your thought...
CLIENT: I just - and then you know I explained to him what was going to happen with my fee structure and what the average rate of what I'm doing is - should be. But he was so not supportive. And it was something I felt was good for me.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. It sounds like you know regardless of the amount that the increment was, that really you were feeling really good about being able to kind of stand your ground and say look, you know I'm being shortchanged here. You are deserving of more and they should be giving you more. And that's something that you're fully aware of. But it sounds like Tony didn't pick up on that and was kind of insensitive to that piece. And you were left feeling like wow, I did all that and I'm so proud of myself and you're not even noticing any of it.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: So it sounds like it was really frustrating for you, you know to be kind of proud going to him and have him say well, look, it's only - you know because that doesn't sound like that's what it was all about for you. I mean certainly not the  - 
CLIENT: Yeah, they complimented me on my work and said that they didn't want me to leave. And I didn't even bring any of that stuff up because by then I was like...
COUNSELOR: You're feeling kind of defeated. I also don't want to let you know the piece that you've brought up, you know go without addressing it (45:03). About coming into therapy and your hopes and expectations for therapy and where you're at now with therapy. You know unfortunately we're out of time for today but I'd love to be able to talk to you more about what that means for you coming in and seeing kind of, knowing, you know or feeling like okay, well if Tony's not going to change, you know what am I going to do? Talk about it every single time I come in?
CLIENT: Right.
COUNSELOR: I'd like to talk to you more about that and see you know how you're feeling about that.
CLIENT: Mmm hmm.
COUNSELOR: Because I think that would be really important as well for us to discuss and see where we go from here. All right? You know and I have - absolutely want your feedback as far as if you feel like it's an important thing to talk about too.
CLIENT: No, I do want to talk about it because every time I come here I think about like, what are we going to talk about?
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: I mean I think the main thing is, is that it frustrates me to spend all that time talking about that when there are other thing that you and I could be focusing on. You know like you had talked about maybe helping me quit smoking or, you know some of the other - I'm interested in you know feedback and with my dynamics of work, because I think that we've pinpointed what the problems are in my relationship with Tony.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm.
CLIENT: And I think that to tackle them, you know, somewhere else. You know like maybe that with another professional.
COUNSELOR: Mmm hmm. You mean couples work?
CLIENT: Yeah.
COUNSELOR: Okay. Well we can talk more about that and kind of get a better angle on what it is that you would like to do from this point on. All right?
CLIENT: All right? I ate something and my stomach's hurting so bad.
COUNSELOR: Oh really? I hope it's nothing serious.
CLIENT: No. My body - my stomach's been doing that for awhile, I don't know why. Because I've been eating fish more often and my body is just getting used to it.
COUNSELOR: Well I wish you a good Thanksgiving.
CLIENT: Thank you, you too.
COUNSELOR: Are you planning to cook stuff?
CLIENT: Yeah, [indiscernible].
COUNSELOR: Oh, that's right. Well don't work too hard. Enjoy yourself.
CLIENT: All right, thank you.
COUNSELOR: Okay, bye.
