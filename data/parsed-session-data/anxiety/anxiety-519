BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	All right, and they, um, remove identifiers so they don't know who you are.
<b>PT:</b>	That's all right.  I'm not worried about it.
<b>DR:</b>	Who cares?  Okay, you look bad.  You look, uh, worried.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, job situation.
<b>DR:</b>	What happened?
<b>PT:</b>	I made a couple of mistakes.
<b>DR:</b>	What we were worried about, isn't it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I just made some mistakes on a clerical paperwork.
<b>DR:</b>	How bad?
<b>PT:</b>	It was, on obituaries, misspelled a name.
<b>DR:</b>	Is that a big no no?
<b>PT:</b>	With them it is, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it once or more than once?
<b>PT:</b>	Three times in the same notice.
<b>DR:</b>	Same name?
<b>PT:</b>	Same name.
<b>DR:</b>	So did you get reprimanded?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What did they say?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I've got to correct it.  You know, try and make sure it doesn't happen again.
<b>DR:</b>	But a letter went into your file?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So if it happens again, you're in deep trouble?
<b>PT:</b>	I believe so.
<b>DR:</b>	But how hard will it be for you to not let it happen again?
<b>PT:</b>	It's going to be hard.  I mean it happens, you know.  I'm only human like anybody else.
<b>DR:</b>	Has this happened before?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I mean what do you, what do you think, uh, led you to do it?  Were you just not paying attention or?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I try to focus and everything and then I get a under a time constraint and that's where it'll happen.
<b>DR:</b>	They'll be too many things to get done.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	And you'll be trying to juggle them—
<b>PT:</b>	And that's when the [INAUDIBLE] kicks in and my eyes kind of dart a little.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  So I mean there's some, uh, sense that you can't handle the stress on you.  In the past you handled it.
<b>PT:</b>	In the past I handled it.
<b>DR:</b>	And now you can't handle it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's too much for you.  Is there a lower level of job you could do there?
<b>PT:</b>	I have to find out, see if I can.
<b>DR:</b>	It would be, uh, if you can't adapt to this job—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You got to make the job adapt to you.  You definitely are better than not working at all, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  I mean you can get up and get to work and do most things.
<b>PT:</b>	Sure.
<b>DR:</b>	It's just that this level of stress or what's required in your specific job duties is too much for you right now.
<b>PT:</b>	I even went so far as to get my eyes checked again, and get another pair of glasses, the whole bit, but when I'm looking at a monitor and then I'm trying to type and, you know, even though I'm slow typing, I try to put the information in, my eyes will just start jumping.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean they'll start jumping?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'll start reading the line and then all of a sudden it would jump a little, just like a flinch.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, and then you can't read?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I come back and read, but then I'll kind of like jump over the word I looked at.  It's hard to describe, but it's—
<b>DR:</b>	It's like, well people with OCD do that sometimes, obsessive compulsive.  They get—
<b>PT:</b>	The jumping.
<b>DR:</b>	Almost like a tic that, you know, and you know, involuntarily they, they go back.  Is that what you're doing?
<b>PT:</b>	It kind of sounds familiar.
<b>DR:</b>	Almost like you have to.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Even though you don't necessarily have to.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'll skip over it or, you know, I'll miss it.
<b>DR:</b>	Hey, how are you?
<b>CG:</b>	Good.  How are you?
<b>DR:</b>	Good.  All right, so we're going through his work difficulties, and, uh, you know, this mistake and, and what fell out from it.  What, what's your sense of what happened and perhaps the reasons?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, he didn't say very much about it to me actually.  Uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you know about it?
<b>CG:</b>	I, I do.  What I know is that, um, he feels that his eyes jumped I guess, and that, um, he made a mistake because it was a difficult name to spell and then—
<b>DR:</b>	What was the name?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	And how, how did you misspell it?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].
<b>CG:</b>	An R instead of an L, and that, uh, the supervisor had to have a witness and speak with him, but that the supervisor didn't even seem to—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, he were making more of it?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, he, he, with the spelling stuff, it was a big deal.
<b>CG:</b>	But he wasn't like bothered by it like [NAME OTHER] was bothered by it—
<b>PT:</b>	No, no.
<b>CG:</b>	That's what I meant.
<b>DR:</b>	Who's [NAME OTHER]?
<b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] was the former guy, the former supervisor who made, you know, out of everything.  This guy—
<b>DR:</b>	Although this can't happen again, right, we all know that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It can't happen again, at least for a year or so.  I mean you're on kind of probation, I imagine.
<b>PT:</b>	It's been a month and a half I guess, right, 2 months?
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, I think almost 2 months.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so listen.  Let me, let us back on track.  I saw you [DATE].  Your mood was okay.  You were not sad or anxious or irritable.  Your appetite was high.  You were gaining weight.  You were exercising.  Your energy was decent.  You were sleeping well, not suicidal, not hopeless or helpless.  Uh, you were working less on your plane, but you were getting some pleasure, [INAUDIBLE] was fair, concentration was fair.  Your wife, you said he was fine, that he was okay now.  And so we said you were in full remission on your cocktail nortriptyline 100, Abilify 5, Lamictal 200 and Ativan as needed.
<b>PT:</b>	Lorazepam.
<b>DR:</b>	So, so in this, lorazepam.  So in this sweep or time, over these 3 months, how's your mood been?  Separate from this setback, how's your mood been in general?
<b>PT:</b>	It's okay sometimes, sometimes not.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	But it's just, you know, it's more normal I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Your mood's been okay.  Remember mood disorders are not being in a bad mood.  It's being stuck in a mood that you can't dig out of.  You're supposed to be in a bad, when something like this happens, this setback happens, you're supposed to be upset.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You really are.  It is a bad thing, right, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, sure.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you got this job back.  You want to do well.  You made a mistake.  It reflects badly on you.  You're supposed to feel bad.
<b>PT:</b>	And it makes me totally uncomfortable working in that location.
<b>DR:</b>	It makes you self conscious about your capacity.
<b>CG:</b>	"Even though [NAME OTHER] made a mistake on the spelling also, but you never told him.	"
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I just never said anything.
<b>CG:</b>	The same name—
<b>PT:</b>	That was before I got called it.
<b>CG:</b>	Was misspelled, but of course, that was by the manager who hadn't the series of events that [PATIENT NAME] has had.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.  You're under a microscope there.  There's going to be, and you know, it'll make you self conscious, but you can do this.  You can do this, but I'm not even going to ask about that.  I don't care about that right now.  Your mood, in general, how's your mood in general?
<b>PT:</b>	Lately, shitty.
<b>DR:</b>	About this, or your mood dropped separate from this?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  You notice more than I do.
<b>CG:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	Like I said we're all involved.
<b>CG:</b>	He, uh, the day that he called you to let you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	And you increased the nortriptyline, he got a little bit of a kick from the nortriptyline.
<b>DR:</b>	From the higher dose.
<b>CG:</b>	But then I don't—
<b>DR:</b>	What's your dose now of nortriptyline?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it's 6 of them.
<b>DR:</b>	Six of the 25's.
<b>PT:</b>	Six of the 25's.
<b>DR:</b>	So it's 150.  When did we increase that?
<b>PT:</b>	Just a few days ago.  I'd say it was about last—
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, was it, maybe a week, you know, maybe shy of a week, I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	And what was our reason?  I don't remember.  I did it on the phone, right?
<b>CG:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I did it on the message.
<b>CG:</b>	You did it on the phone.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, cause I could feel my mood get real low.
<b>CG:</b>	He said to me afterwards that he was down really low and—
<b>DR:</b>	And so it slowed the progression by being on—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe to a flat point or to it went back up?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it sort of flattened it and then the last two days—
<b>DR:</b>	It's going back again.
<b>CG:</b>	He, he had like a couple days of like okay though.
<b>DR:</b>	You did?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Do you realize that?
<b>PT:</b>	Not really.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay, well you did, and then you started—
<b>DR:</b>	Couple of days.  You had two good days?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, I'm going to say two.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, your liver may have just gotten really good at, at eating up or metabolizing nortriptyline.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And your system may be seeing lower blood levels at the time.
<b>CG:</b>	Did you show doctor that, of course, that's from a while ago.  It was 123.
<b>PT:</b>	Here.
<b>DR:</b>	When, when was this?
<b>CG:</b>	The date's on there.  I forget.  The date's somewhere on the top.
<b>DR:</b>	This is [DATE] at 11:00 in the morning.  You had it in the morning, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It means that the 150 may have pushed him up.  Normally I would just keep pushing.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But the nortriptyline, what they claim is that there's a window that you have to be in.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You can't be above the window.  You can't be below the window.
<b>CG:</b>	Yes.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The window is 50 to 150.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So the fact that you were 123 on 100 means that we may be pushing you out of the window—
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	At the 150, except that you got a bump.  You're having a higher dose.
<b>CG:</b>	Now when did you, he had two times in the past two weeks where he totally forgot to take his meds, totally.
<b>DR:</b>	You feel worse those days?
<b>PT:</b>	Last night to the night before.  I felt kind of weird the next day.
<b>CG:</b>	This was yesterday actually because today's Tuesday and you forgot to take it Sunday.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	So yesterday—
<b>PT:</b>	Because we went out.  I forgot to take all of it.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.  So how did you feel yesterday?
<b>PT:</b>	In the morning I was kind of like—
<b>CG:</b>	Of course he was—
<b>PT:</b>	And then that guy showed up in the afternoon, [INAUDIBLE] it started again.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And like today.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, I know, I could see it was.
<b>DR:</b>	But you, you've crashed because you're off the medicine?
<b>CG:</b>	Well, I don't know what kind of a residual effect.  I mean he did take it last night.
<b>DR:</b>	He took it last night.
<b>CG:</b>	But he didn't remember to take it Sunday night, and then like maybe within that 7 to 10 day span there was another time that he did not remember to take it.  So I don't know whether he gets highs and lows for several days thereafter.  This is new.  He's never forgotten to take it before.
<b>DR:</b>	Why would you forget to take it?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe you're testing, you know, just, just because you feel so bad.  Now, did we lose something by dropping your Abilify from 10 to 5 back in July?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, it didn't happen right away.
<b>DR:</b>	Was your mood okay?  Was your mood okay until recently?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's kind of anxious.  Every day I get anxious when I go to work.  That keeps me at a certain level.  I can't afford to take lorazepam because I nod off.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, all right, let's keep going.  We'll figure this out.  All right, we increased the, uh, nortriptyline to 150 despite a 123 blood level in July.  What's your appetite like now?
<b>PT:</b>	That's never been a problem.
<b>DR:</b>	It's okay.  You sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your self esteem?
<b>PT:</b>	Right now.
<b>DR:</b>	You feel like you're no good?  Feel guilty?  What do you feel guilty about?
<b>PT:</b>	Just—
<b>CG:</b>	Not being able to handle the stress.
<b>DR:</b>	Why should that make you feel guilty?  What about that makes you feel guilty?  Guilty is usually something like you're not living up to your family's expectations of you.  So you feel guilty for what it's doing to your family [INAUDIBLE].  Cry much?
<b>PT:</b>	Cry every day.
<b>CG:</b>	It must be something.  Are you like dwelling on the fact that [INAUDIBLE] talk to you about [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?
<b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] is at school, at [DEIDENTIFIED] first year and [INAUDIBLE] personality conflict that [INAUDIBLE] to the point where the girl's father came in a huff and moved her out and said that [INAUDIBLE] daughter because she felt unsafe, but you know, have issues and whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	What, what was her problem?
<b>CG:</b>	We're not sure, but anyway, so she moved down the hall—
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, this is good stuff.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, what was the, uh—
<b>CG:</b>	She, well you know, I mean our kid isn't I guess as well seasoned as other kids maybe.  Our kid didn't understand that when she didn't come home to sleep, it wasn't her business, and, um, she just like doesn't understand people who will say hi to you every 4th time that you have an encounter and things like that.
<b>DR:</b>	So how did she react to?
<b>CG:</b>	Well she reacted, you know, first, she, she blamed herself.  She said I've tried to think of what I did to upset her, and I've tried to befriend and I've blah, blah, and I said well [NAME OTHER] clearly this is [NAME OTHER]'s problem and please don't take it on as yours, but of course, that's easier said than done, right.  So I mean, anyway, so, um, that really destroyed her self esteem.
<b>DR:</b>	Other than the roommate problem, has she been doing okay up there?
<b>CG:</b>	Well, no because that's had residual effects.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	Then she felt, you know, she was sequestering herself in a room and things like that, but anyway, just last night she called us and said she's getting a new roommate.  She sounded very upbeat.  She's hopeful and, but she was in a slump and so it's definitely had an effect.
<b>DR:</b>	Is she doing okay in her classes?
<b>CG:</b>	We think so, but she doesn't really say too much, so we're trying to know what our role is now—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] her 16 credits.
<b>CG:</b>	She, we, we asked her to drop one class, and now she's only taking 16 credits, and it's, it's just like a new transition for all of us.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	So I mean and [PATIENT NAME] doesn't do well with change, and she was sort of in a slump, so it just occurred to me were you wondering that she inherited like not being able to get out of a slump?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	No, this looks pretty—
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Biological to me.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, he's—
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	He's just relapsing.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	His depression's coming back.  I think a bigger, uh, challenge is the work situation.  I think that's really—
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Unraveling you.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, it is.  I mean he, almost every day he says to me I'm not comfortable there.  I'm not wanted there.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's a vicious cycle because the depression is making that worse, right?  The depression's making you focus on negative things and not being capable and self conscious, and so if we can get your depression lifted, you'll, you'll function much better at work.  You won't be so sensitive to all this stuff.  Um, any suicidal thinking?
<b>CG:</b>	That's why you didn't want me to come in, right?
<b>DR:</b>	Suicidal thoughts?
<b>CG:</b>	You want me to go outside [PATIENT NAME]?
<b>DR:</b>	No, no, stay.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	We're not secretive.  Everyone's suicidal when they get depressed.  It's not, it's not a big deal.  We just have to be clear that you're not going to kill yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, do you think about death a lot?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Your thoughts.
<b>PT:</b>	Frustration.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You think everyone would be better off with, with you dead?  That's what you think?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have a specific plan to hurt yourself?  It's really the guilt that drives this, right?  No plan whatsoever?  Pills, jumping, nothing like that?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Feel kind of hopeless?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Helpless and overwhelmed?  Very hard to, uh, concentrate on your work?  Feel anxious all the time?  Worse in the morning?  You have really bad mornings, but when you wake up, you feel like in agony almost?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Get any panic attacks?
<b>PT:</b>	I do.  I hide it pretty well.
<b>DR:</b>	Well panic attack is something very specific.  All of a sudden out of nowhere you feel like you're going to die, crushing in your chest, sweating in your palms and that kind of stuff.
<b>PT:</b>	I get like hyperventilating.
<b>DR:</b>	Get kind of sub threshold panic like, like mini panic attacks?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you [INAUDIBLE] in one of those?
<b>PT:</b>	It's kind of unglued [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so you're clearly relapsing.  We need to throw the kitchen sink at all.  You know, we really need to just get more aggressive to get you better because if you stay this way for too long, you know, I think losing the job would not be good for you.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, that would be devastating.
<b>DR:</b>	You got to find a way to keep this job.
<b>CG:</b>	What about that thing that I said about using straight edge.  Does that, have you tried that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but my eyes still jump.  They'll be all right and then all of a sudden, it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Been to an eye doctor?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What'd he say?
<b>CG:</b>	Did you talk to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] about that?  [INAUDIBLE] specifically discuss that?
<b>PT:</b>	He didn't say anything when I mentioned it.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, he's an optometrist.  Perhaps we need to get you to an ophthalmologist.
<b>DR:</b>	Go to an ophthalmologist.  I mean at least get it evaluated.  I, I never heard of it.  So you, you jump back all the time.
<b>PT:</b>	They'll jump back, or my eyes will jump like this and then I refocus again and keep going.  It's the strangest thing.  I don't know why.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it an anxiety thing?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I was thinking maybe one of the meds I'm taking is causing like a jump.  I don't know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, I mean Lamictal sometimes can cause blurry vision, and the nortriptyline can also, blurry vision or harder to [INAUDIBLE].  That's if it's up on the computer.  Do you have the same problem with reading on a page?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] and all of a sudden I just lost the whole focus and everything else, and it seemed like it was quiet for a few minutes, but it was only like a couple of seconds [INAUDIBLE] to pick it up and just finish.
<b>DR:</b>	You can't focus well.
<b>CG:</b>	Not for a long period of time I guess.
<b>PT:</b>	It's hard for me to tell.  I don't know.  I can't tell you.
<b>DR:</b>	Very obsessional, like in checking things, the oven, door lock?
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	She does it.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you get any pleasure from anything?  Is there anything that you enjoy?
<b>PT:</b>	I enjoy going out, when we go out someplace.
<b>CG:</b>	Did you have fun Sunday?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	You're looking forward to having [NAME OTHER] come home this weekend?
<b>PT:</b>	Go away someplace overnight like when we went up for parent's [INAUDIBLE] even though we didn't do anything there.
<b>CG:</b>	Was that fun?
<b>PT:</b>	That was, getting away it was.
<b>CG:</b>	It was good.
<b>DR:</b>	My thought is we either trade nortriptyline for something different, or add something to it, add something.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	There's a lot of medicines to add.  I mean I don't want you to think that whatever I add you're going to be on forever, but just right now because you're doing so bad, we got to work for while, right?  We like nortriptyline.
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.  Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	What often works is to combine a, a tricycline, nortriptyline with an SSRI.  Do you know what SSRI and that class of medicine?  Those are [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b>	You were on that, but it wasn't the right—
<b>DR:</b>	Everyone starts out on that—
<b>PT:</b>	Dose and you were on the Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b>	SSRIs are Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Celexa, you know, things like that, even Effexor is, is—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um, any of those meds would be helpful for you for us to add.  So, and you know what else I'd like to add is Lithium.  Ever used Lithium?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Lithium, not, I wouldn't use it at bipolar doses, so we wouldn't have to check blood levels or anything like that.  There are two ways to use Lithium.  You know, Lithium is a salt.  It's like a rock.  You know, it's [INAUDIBLE] drug.  It's like a rock.  It's like salt.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But it, it's, it changed the world of bipolar treatment for people who are manic depressive.  It, you know, dramatically stabilizes mood, but then it was also noticed that if you use a small dose to augment, to add to antidepressant—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	It also works very nicely.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And especially nortriptyline.  It works nicely with nortriptyline.  So I'd like to add Lithium, and it's particularly good for suicidal thinking.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	But I think for all those reasons, we should augment Lithium to the nortriptyline.  I really don't want to change your nortriptyline dose.  You know, we pulled back to 125 fearful that we may have overshot—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	The comfort level.  I'm going to give you a few things to do.  Also even though it may not be a home run, it wouldn't hurt us to raise the Lamictal dose also.  We're going to do about four different things.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'll write them out as we do them.  Number one, we're going to reduce nortriptyline to 125, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Number two, you're going to use Lithium, NYC03 is Lithium 450 every night.  Now on the very small chance, you know, the reason we check blood levels for people who are bipolar is that the effective dose for manic depressive is very close to the, the toxic dose or lethal dose, but those doses are up at about 1,800 mg.  At 450, we shouldn't even be close to those doses.  So we don't have to check levels unless you start getting tremors or nausea.  If you get either of those things, give me a call.  I mean that you might be one of the few people from a small dose gives you a big blood level.  That won't happen, but just know that those are the two side effects we look for, tremor and nausea.  That would mean that the Lithium may be at a dose that we'd want to lower.  Number three, let me just give you something to have in the office like an SSRI.  Uh, what, of the SSRIs, Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, Celexa, have any of them ever worked for you?
<b>PT:</b>	Paxil I took.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, no, um, you know what, he was on Lexapro when he first came to you, but it was such a minimal dose that you said it was never going to work for his situation.
<b>DR:</b>	But as an augmenter maybe—
<b>CG:</b>	Maybe.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe that, that would help.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Remember we just need something—
<b>CG:</b>	He, he got an initial kick from the Lexapro.
<b>DR:</b>	He did, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So that's a good sign.  That suggests that it gets into your system.
<b>CG:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And even the fact that when we raised the nortriptyline you got a little better means your real problem is getting an antidepressant response, it's in holding an antidepressant response like the [INAUDIBLE] of your mood is such that we can't maintain a response.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	So we'll start, I'll, I'll just give you a bunch of Lexapro, and you, you'll use the smallest dose, 10 mg per day.  We'll increase the, uh, Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Now you take the 200s?
<b>PT:</b>	Two hundred.
<b>DR:</b>	Just take 1 and a half for that, take 300, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	That's not a problem.
<b>DR:</b>	And, um—
<b>CG:</b>	Leave the Abilify at 5?
<b>DR:</b>	For now.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	We don't get much difference.  In fact, most people, as Abilify is an antidepressant, I have them on 1 mg, 1 or 2 mg.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>DR:</b>	Even at a very low dose you get what you need.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't want to lower you now, but I don't think raising it would make a difference.  So, so we'll leave it at the Abilify 5, and how much, uh, Ativan are you using?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] .5 that I have.
<b>DR:</b>	And the Abilify 5, unless we think that it was the lowering of the Abilify that set up this change.
<b>CG:</b>	How long would that take?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, we looked, it should not come fast.  So we lowered it [DATE].
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Were you okay for August?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, well, you know what, he wasn't back at work yet.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	So—
<b>DR:</b>	But at home he was okay?
<b>CG:</b>	But he, uh, yeah.  I think so.
<b>DR:</b>	He was okay?
<b>CG:</b>	I think so.
<b>DR:</b>	So it wasn't until September, October that this started?
<b>CG:</b>	Um, yeah I'd say.
<b>DR:</b>	So we're going to keep the Abilify at 5.  Then I'd, I'd like to hear from you every week, okay, on the voicemail, just leave me a message.  Tell me, tell me if that's clear.
<b>CG:</b>	So, um, he would take all of these every night?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Is that the best way to do it?
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Because that's what he's been in the habit of.
<b>DR:</b>	Yep.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so I'll give you, uh, probably come back, if things aren't much, much better, come back in a month.  If things are better or going in the right direction, come back in 2 months, but if, if you're stuck, come back in a month.  You make the appointment for 2 months and let's hope for the best.
<b>CG:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	But if you're really in this state, you know, not—
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	Not getting traction, come back in a month because at all costs, you got to keep this job.
<b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, I'll write the prescription for Lithium.
<b>CG:</b>	Is there any benefit to getting another nortriptyline level?
<b>DR:</b>	Not yet.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Not yet, but, uh maybe.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe if we can't get traction [INAUDIBLE] Lamictal, will you need more Lamictal?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So I'll write for the 150, so it'll just be easy to take 2 of the 150's.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Other prescriptions?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, well yes, because we'll be running out of nortriptyline now.
<b>DR:</b>	Well the nortriptyline I'm writing for 5 a day, okay.
<b>CG:</b>	Sure.
<b>DR:</b>	But you may find that it, the, uh, the reading problem get worse when we bumped the nortriptyline to 150?  Pay attention to that because if it gets worse when we bump the Lamictal, we'll, we'll want to go back on the Lamictal.  Do you need the Abilify or not?
<b>CG:</b>	I don't know.  You were going to check that last time.  I don't know—
<b>DR:</b>	Well we can always call that in.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh.
<b>DR:</b>	The Lexapro prescription I'll write for the 20's, and you break them in half because your dose is 10.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, I'll give you a bunch also, but I might as well write the prescription.  All right, so I expect to hear from you every week.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's a, that's a month's worth.  Okay, hang in there, okay.  You know what, do you pay out of pocket at all for the Abilify?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, no.  It's, you know, like for copay or—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I mean expired, but they don't go bad.  This will save you 2 month's of that, all right.  So, but break those in half.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Take care.
<b>CG:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] prescription.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, she, she has to write your name on it.
<b>CG:</b>	Oh, okay.  All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Take care.
<b>CG:</b>	Once again, okay, bye bye.
