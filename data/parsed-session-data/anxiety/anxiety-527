<b>DR:</b>	How are you doing today?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, okay.  I, uh, well, why don't you start.
<b>CG:</b>	Well, we just, uh, saw [NAME OTHER] yesterday, and she wanted me to give this to you.  She is concerned, um, that he's cycling a lot, that there's depression, that there's agitation, um, and we're supposed to talk with you about your opinion of managing the rapid cycling and is his inability to focus and concentrate more ADD or more, uh, manic feature.  That's what she was wondering.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a tough call.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, you got features of both, right?  Bipolar as well as ADD, but we were never successful with ADD medications, right?
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How have you been feeling since I saw you last?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, when was the last time we saw each other?  Two—
<b>DR:</b>	A couple of weeks.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, Friday, like not last Friday, but the, okay—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it's been ehh, but today it's pretty good, so I'm pretty level for reasons unknown.
<b>DR:</b>	Today you're having a good day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	What's different about today?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I saw [NAME OTHER] yesterday.  I mean, today had one bad part, that was about it.
<b>DR:</b>	What made it bad?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, basically, I just, the teacher was kind of asking me questions straight at me.  It really put me on the spot, and I was just kind of sitting there sweating, and I'm like, "Oh my God."  I couldn't think about what to say.  I was only thinking about how much I was on the spot, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	So you were very anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	Something like that, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well how much of the focus problem is anxiety?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think very much of it, but, but it could be a factor.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't seem agitated today.
<b>PT:</b>	Well—
<b>DR:</b>	Last time, you seemed more agitated.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah, I'm reasonable today, that's really all I can say, is today is, is very different.
<b>CG:</b>	He was taking, you had suggested, um, and prescribed the, uh, clonidine, and he was taking it just at night, but it was really knocking him out.
<b>DR:</b>	That's why I gave it to him, to help him sleep, 'cause he said he wanted a sleeping pill.
<b>CG:</b>	But you were also hoping that it would increase his focus during the day.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>CG:</b>	And it didn't.
<b>DR:</b>	And reduce agitation.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Did it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, it did.  I, I didn't take it on the weekend though because I like to stay up late and, you know, it knocks me out before ten thirty and that really [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you taking a whole pill or half?
<b>PT:</b>	Half a pill twice a day.
<b>CG:</b>	But you were only taking it at night.  I don't think you ever actually took it during the day because—
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>CG:</b>	At night it knocked him out so much, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, but the next day, did you feel calmer, less anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, the next day?  Well, mom, I think my mother noticed that I had a little less ADD featuring.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  Did, did you take it last night?
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, no I didn't.  Um—
<b>CG:</b>	Well, because he was complaining that then he also couldn't get up in the morning, and he was just—
<b>PT:</b>	So mom got frustrated with that and—
<b>CG:</b>	So it was hard to tell.  I mean, other things can come along and, and he seems to be better because he has something to look forward to, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Well then the other question was how much of the mood changes or the cycling is internal versus how much is from external stimuli, you know?  If there are things in the outside world that make you feel better, make you feel worse, and like, it's like you have no real defenses.  You're just a ping pong ball, you know, in, in the world basically.  So if somebody smiles at you, you feel good, or is somebody frowns at you, you feel bad.  Is that going on?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, a little bit, I think it does.
<b>DR:</b>	And how much of it, how much of it is from the external stimuli verses how much is just from internal fluctuations?
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, I, a lot of people commented on the difference in my hair, and—
<b>DR:</b>	More red.
<b>PT:</b>	It, much more red, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	What, what made you do that?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I, I just did.  This was my plan when I blackened my hair in the first place.  Of course, you probably didn't see that, but I blackened it, and then about a week later, I went through and dyed it the rest of the way.
<b>DR:</b>	See, I'm wondering how much of it is, is truly internal fluctuations, and he's just, it's like he has no adequate defense system operating, so—
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	He, he's just at the mercy of the world in a sense.
<b>CG:</b>	You know, I do think that I see that because whenever there's an issue between the two of us, it goes downhill really fast.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right.
<b>CG:</b>	Really fast, and then there's a lot of emotion of, uh, he gets a bad grade on the test, and he's just devastated, and—
<b>DR:</b>	He's just what?
<b>CG:</b>	He's just devastated.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I remember the last time, too, when you were really up was when this girl smiled at you or something or, wasn't there a girl that you were interested in that—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that was kind of, we were kind of doing a little better, and then all of the sudden, bam—
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right.
<b>PT:</b>	It got terrible, so that—
<b>DR:</b>	So it's, it's based on interactions with other people.  What do we do about that?  I mean, we can use like a, a medication that might kind of have numbing effects so he's not so sensitive, that's a possibility.  Um, or we could do more therapy to try to build his own defense system basically so that he's not so receptive to the, the external stimuli, or maybe a combination of the two.
<b>CG:</b>	He will literally say, and I'll notice he just, just feels terrible, and I'll say, "What's wrong?"  He'll say, "I don't know.  I just had this wave of depression come over me."  So—
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes that's just random though, too.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you're, you're on, I mean, if you look at medicine, you're still taking the Neurontin—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You're not taking the clonidine anymore.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I could.  It's been a rotten day.
<b>DR:</b>	And what else?  He's taking the, uh—
<b>CG:</b>	He's taking the Abilify.
<b>DR:</b>	Abilify.  Well, both the Abilify, the Abilify has more of a numbing effect than the Neurontin.  Neurontin is more to help with the bipolar condition to stabilize mood, but Abilify has a bit of that numbing effect that he wouldn't be as sensitive to the external stimuli.  Now when went, what is it, 10 mg Neurontin?
<b>CG:</b>	Is it the, it's the half in the morning and—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, 5—
<b>CG:</b>	A full tablet at night—
<b>DR:</b>	Fifteen.
<b>CG:</b>	Is 5 and 10.
<b>DR:</b>	That's 15, yeah, that's a good enough dose.  Is it having benefit for you in terms of making you less sensitive to the outside world?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I have no idea.  It's been the same for so long that I really don't, I don't tell much of a difference, and I remember Risperdal worked, but I don't want to go back to that to degree of numbness because that—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah—
<b>PT:</b>	Happy.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] numbness.  I mean, Risperdal would be a good drug to use.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I, I was on it for a long time before and eventually I just decided I wanted to be off of it 'cause I couldn't feel, I couldn't feel at all.  I just—
<b>DR:</b>	But that, it's, it's a dose related phenomenon.  So, the more—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Risperdal you take, the more numb you are, but maybe if we use a small amount of it, it might help you be so, not so sensitive to things.  I mean, it might be worth a try, even if we use a quarter mg or—
<b>CG:</b>	Were there side effects that were an issue also?
<b>PT:</b>	I was tired.
<b>DR:</b>	Tired, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and, well, I mean, other than just the complete lack of emotion, that was pretty much all.
<b>DR:</b>	Which you don't like.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't like.  I mean, I—
<b>DR:</b>	But you're, you're less volatile when you're on something like that, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I am by a great deal.  I'm much more manageable.
<b>DR:</b>	What if we just try like a real low dose, like a quarter mg of it?
<b>CG:</b>	Would you consider that?
<b>PT:</b>	Sure.
<b>CG:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	I really got, I really escaped from it for a reason, but any, anything above that I'm not willing to accept.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, well why don't we just try a quarter mg.
<b>PT:</b>	I believe we still have some in our house.
<b>CG:</b>	We have a big bottle of it.
<b>DR:</b>	Of the quarter mg?
<b>CG:</b>	Uh, I can't remember what dose, it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if they're halves, you can break them in half.  I can show you.
<b>CG:</b>	They're reddish colored.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I don't remember.  I could check, but I, I think if, if it's a half mg, we could break it in half.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	We can always quarter it if it—
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's not a mg I don't think.  I—
<b>CG:</b>	[NAME OTHER] mentioned the idea of Lamictal?
<b>DR:</b>	Lamictal is a good mood stabilizer, but he's all ready on the Neurontin, and we would duplicate things by adding Lamictal.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh, I could switch from Neurontin to Lamictal—
<b>CG:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	But he had a good response for years on the Neurontin.
<b>CG:</b>	Yeah, he did.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so I hate to get him off that, but Lamictal's a good drug.  It, it actually is a similar type of antiseizure medication, but it has more of a mood boost than the Neurontin does, so it'll help your mood to be lifted more.
<b>CG:</b>	Now, it has some possibilities of some fairly severe side effects?
<b>DR:</b>	No, the only side effect you worry about is skin rash.  If you get a red, itchy, skin rash, you have to stop it, and if you drink alcohol, I've seen irritability, but you don't drink alcohol anyway.  Or do you?
<b>PT:</b>	I have a glass of wine at dinner, every dinner with my dad.
<b>DR:</b>	Every night?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, you don't see him every night, do you?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, no, no, just every night I see him.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I wouldn't recommend the wine because it'll, you know, but other than that, the other side effects are really benign.
<b>CG:</b>	So the skin rash isn't serious?
<b>DR:</b>	No, it's, well, it is serious if you get it, but it's not common.
<b>CG:</b>	And—
<b>DR:</b>	I've never seen it.
<b>CG:</b>	How do you remedy it if he—
<b>DR:</b>	You have to stop the medicine.  You can't take it.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay, but there's not—
<b>DR:</b>	No, if you stop it, it'll go away.
<b>CG:</b>	It will?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but if you keep taking it, it'll get worse, and then you could have problems, so you want to stop it if, if you get it, but you would know it, but I, like I say, it's, it's not—
<b>CG:</b>	If, if you stop it, then there's no real severe—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, if you get it, you would get it.  I, see the thing about Lamictal too, it's a very, very slow titration curve.  It, you start at 25 mg, take that for two weeks; then 50 mg, and the reason they do it so slowly is to protect against the skin rash.  If you get it, you can stop it.  The dose of Lamictal, I've had patients respond to 25, and I have patients responding to 300, so it's a big titration curve, so it takes a while to figure out, but it is an excellent medication, you know, and it works.  It tends to lift mood and, uh, and stabilize mood quite well, better than Neurontin.  It's a better mood stabilizer.  If you want, we could make, I don't want to make too many changes though.
<b>CG:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm not going to add Risperdal and do the Lamictal.  We could do one or the other and see which is more effective.  Um—
<b>CG:</b>	Maybe the Risperdal would be better to do.
<b>DR:</b>	I think the Risperdal would be quicker because, like I say, the Neurontin switch I'd have to slowly lower, I think we were on like 1800 mg of Neurontin anyways, so, we'd have to really slowly take, it'll be, it'll take a lot more to do that, whereas the Risperdal I'll just add a quarter mg in the morning if you're not too tired, or if he is too tired, at night, and we'd see results more quickly.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And I'm beginning to think it's more externally stimulated.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And this is a good drug.  It'll have that numbing effect so you wouldn't, you wouldn't worry as much, but I'm going to keep everything else the same.  Keep the Abilify the same.  We'll give him a, just a quarter mg of Risperdal during the day.  If you're tolerating and not too tired, stay with breakfast.  If you are, switch to dinner—
<b>PT:</b>	Hum.
<b>DR:</b>	And once a day.
<b>CG:</b>	It's difficult because I think he's really having a, a hard time just functioning.  I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well his moods are up and down—
<b>CG:</b>	Getting through the day, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	But in terms of the ADD profile in terms of trying to [INAUDIBLE], you'd never have success with, with those medications.  Never has a stimulants made it worse.  Plus, if he really, if it is a bipolar and that's what we assess, you can really flip into a manic state.
<b>CG:</b>	Even using the Abilify, that—
<b>DR:</b>	That'll protect it.  Oh yeah, that'll protect it.  But if I give him a, if I give him an ADD medication, it can worsen.
<b>CG:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The opposite.  But he looks better today, much better than last time I saw him.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's not just the hair though, it's also—
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	But I like your hair.
<b>PT:</b>	The hair is kind of lifting me up too—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I like the hair.  It's a nice style.  I don't know if I would get that style, but—
<b>CG:</b>	You ought to think about it.  You could relate better to the students [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Oh boy, that's—
