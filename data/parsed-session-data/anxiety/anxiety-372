Yalom (1995) described interpersonal
learning and the social microcosm as
among the most influential explanations for
change in group counseling. The maladaptive
patterns in interpersonal relationships that
prompt clients to seek counseling soon manifest
themselves in their interactions with other
members in the group (Slater, 1966).
Accordingly, it has been suggested that the
multicultural or diverse group provides a setting
where racial and cultural stereotypes,
prejudices, and misconceptions are likely to
surface in a manner that can most effectively
lead to active processing and efficacious
interpersonal learning (Brook, Gordon, &amp;
Meadow, 1998; White, 1994). Group
members bring their own social and cultural
values, beliefs, and expectations into each
interpersonal encounter (Ettin, 1994). As
such, the diverse group affords its members a
unique opportunity to identify and reflect on
interpersonal perceptions, relationships, and
conflicts that arise from sociocultural differences.
Furthermore, the diverse group provides
a setting in which members are able to
improve their capacity to stay engaged in an
intercultural dialogue that enhances interpersonal
growth through dual concerns for self
and others while exploring the intricacies of
myriad levels of common and diverse human
experiences (Coll, Cook-Nobles, &amp; Surrey,
1997).

Ethical codes and guidelines of the
American Psychological Association (1992,
1993, 2002) and the American Counseling
Association (1995) mandate that mental
health professionals develop and maintain
competencies in the delivery of multicultural
psychological services. A critical question facing
group counselors is how to develop and
implement multicultural competencies in the
context of the complex sociocultural forces
(Rutan &amp; Stone, 2001) that affect group interaction,
process, and outcome. Although the
Multicultural Counseling Competency Model
(MCCM) (Arredondo et al., 1996; Sue, 2001;
Sue, Arredondo, &amp; McDavis, 1992; Sue et al.,
1982) has been widely recognized by the counseling
and psychology professions and
embraced in training programs (Ponterotto,
Fuertes, &amp; Chen, 2000), it has yet to be incorporated
into the training of group counselors.
The lack of a cohesive, theoretical structure
for integrating multicultural competencies into
group counseling practice presents a barrier
that is likely to preclude otherwise motivated
group counselors from maximizing the therapeutic
potential of these groups.


The main goals of this chapter are to
increase the group counselor's ability to identify
and conceptualize the psychosocial influences
of diversity on communication in the
group counseling process and to assist the
group counselor to develop an expanded
repertoire of interventions grounded in theoretical
structures of multicultural group counseling.
In accordance with these goals, this
chapter is predicated on three assumptions
that warrant further clarification.


First, we adopt a psychosocial analysis of
culture (e.g., Helms, 1994; Ho, 1995; Phinney,
1996). Defined as a network of domain-specific
knowledge structures shared by members
of a social-cultural group (Gudykunst &amp; Kim,
1997; Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet-Martínez,
2000), culture is internalized and functions
as a set of templates that guide and govern
interpersonal expectations, perceptions, and
interpretations across situations. These systems
of knowledge or templates have been
described as differing in terms of cultural individualism-collectivism
(Triandis, 1989) and,
by extension, low-context and high-context
communication (Hall, 1976); cultural variability
(Hofstede, 1980); and cultural value orientations
(Kluckhohn &amp; Strodtbeck, 1961).
Although space limitations preclude a description
of these dimensions, it is important to
note that similarities and differences along
these dimensions are linked to group affiliations
and identities. These linkages, combined
with variation between in-group (i.e., groups
that are considered important to members,
such as family and racial or ethnic groups)
and out-group (i.e., groups that are less important
to members) communication norms,
exert considerable leverage on interpersonal
communication.


A second assumption is that all interpersonal
encounters in the counseling group
context, although differing in degree and in
kind, are multicultural in nature. Individuals
in a counseling group may share common systems
of group-based knowledge due to shared
race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation,
for example. The degree to which systems of
knowledge are shared and the specific application
of these systems, however, may vary
widely as a function of unique life experiences
and the relative importance of in-group membership
to identity. In effect, the group practitioner
must be able to identify and appreciate
three distinct but dynamically intertwined levels
of personal identity variables: human or
universal-level variables, social or group-level
variables, and individual or personal-level
identity variables (Kluckhohn &amp; Murray,
1953; Leong, 1996; Turner, 1987), as well as
the dynamic interactions between levels and
their influences on interpersonal communication.
By maintaining an integrated, dynamic
perspective of human identity and motivation,

[p. <i>458</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00472&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our third assumption is that diversity is
best understood in a way that reflects the permeable
boundaries and shifting borders of culture
in the complexity of group life. As such,
we conceptualize diversity in the context of
group counseling as communicated through
our interactions with others. As Frey (2000)
contended,
<blockquote>
<p>
Diversity itself is not an inherent, predetermined
condition per se; it is a symbolic concept
that is created and sustained through
interaction. In that regard, communication
is not just a tool that can be used to manage
diversity (although it certainly is such a
tool); diversity itself, however it is defined,
is best regarded as emerging from communication.
Consequently, changing the form of
communication (e.g., using dialogue instead
of discussion) potentially has the power to
change the very nature of what group members
(and scholars) perceive to constitute
diversity, (p. 226)

Diversity itself is not an inherent, predetermined
condition per se; it is a symbolic concept
that is created and sustained through
interaction. In that regard, communication
is not just a tool that can be used to manage
diversity (although it certainly is such a
tool); diversity itself, however it is defined,
is best regarded as emerging from communication.
Consequently, changing the form of
communication (e.g., using dialogue instead
of discussion) potentially has the power to
change the very nature of what group members
(and scholars) perceive to constitute
diversity, (p. 226)


Similar to the assumptions made with
respect to the multiple yet intertwined levels of
individual identity functioning, the collective
identity of the group is best conceived of in a
flexible, evolving manner. The symbolic construction
of the group identity influences both
the unfolding of interpersonal dynamics and,
ultimately, counseling outcomes. As such, the
dual aspects of diversity as a <i>relationship</i> and
diversity as a <i>process</i> are emphasized. Diversity
as a relationship concerns how specific group
constructs, such as cohesion, conflicts, impasses,
and subgrouping, are affected by the diverse
modes of communication of the group's members,
as well as the sociocultural positions
from which they communicate. Diversity as a
process, on the other hand, reflects the group's
evolving understanding of its own diversity
and how diversity shapes interaction and
communication in the group over time. A
group is a complex entity composed of multiple,
interactive parts. Much more than the sum
of its member, leader, subgroup, and wholegroup
identities, each group involves interactions
at numerous levels, including the
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and group-as-a-whole
levels (Fuhriman &amp; Burlingame, 1994;
Kivlighan, Coleman, &amp; Anderson, 2000).
Understanding diversity as reflected in the
group process therefore requires attention to
and distinctions between the interplay of these
parts, on one hand, and the connection of
these interactions into the temporal matrix of
the group, on the other.


In our attempt to understand how diversity
is reflected in communication and how it
affects the group outcome, we present a dialogical
or interactional perspective that has, at
its core, two related but different concepts:
self-disclosure and interpersonal feedback. In
the section that follows, we provide an
overview of the dialogical perspective, with
particular attention to prospects and challenges
inherent in intercultural dialogues.
These possibilities and perils are examined
within the context of the theories of social cognition
(e.g., Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991) and anxiety/uncertainty
management (Gudykunst,
1995). The second section integrates these
concepts with the processes of self-disclosure
and feedback in the diverse group. We
describe the specific roles and functions of self-disclosure
and feedback relative to interpersonal
learning in the group social microcosm
and in the intercultural dialogue. In the third
section, which suggests practice implications
for the group counselor, we discuss the multicultural
effectiveness and competence of the
group leader in light of the four leadership
roles described by Yalom (1995): participant
observer, norm shaper, historian, and Technical
expert. Then, a case vignette is presented to
illustrate the dialogic perspective at work in
the counseling group. This chapter concludes

[p. <i>459</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00473&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Intercultural Dialogue: Prospects and Challenges</b>

In the therapeutic context of the group system,
each member's therapeutic work is inherently
dependent on her or his relationship with
other members. These symbiotic relationships
may be described as one of three types: commensalistic,
parasitic, or mutualistic. In
commensalistic symbiosis, members simply
happen to work in the group system with little
interaction among them, either not communicating
(i.e., the avoidance of interaction)
or having severed communication (Gass &amp;
Varonis, 1991). In parasitic symbiosis, members
accomplish their goals at the others'
expense. It is in a system characterized by
mutualistic symbiosis where members work
collaboratively and benefit mutually from
shared interaction. When members acknowledge
their mutually beneficial interdependence,
miscommunication problems, such as
misunderstanding, incomplete understanding,
and conflict, may be addressed more easily. By
fostering a dialogical mode of communication,
the group leader seeks to engender a symbiosis
of mutuality and respect so that individual
change is facilitated and monitored collaboratively
within the context of the larger group
dynamics.


Grounded in a collaborative communication
process where personal experiences,
assumptions, and predispositions are explored
to deepen understanding, dialogue differs
from other modes of communication, such as
monologue or discussion, and more effectively
facilitates the formation of mutually beneficial
symbiotic relationships in the group. <i>Monologue</i>,
as defined by Gudykunst and Kim (1997),
refers to a conversation that is self-oriented
and ignores the input or response of other
interactants, thus leaving the speaker to control
the direction and topics of conversation.
<i>Discussion</i> is typically described as a problem-solving
conversation emphasizing an analysis
of opposing perspectives, opinions, or beliefs
with the goal of reaching a compromise or a
consensus (Frey, 2000). Dialogical interaction,
however, allows group members, through a
shared sense of control and ownership and the
mutual confirmation of experiences, to establish
a collaborative and mutually beneficial
relationship. Facilitated and monitored effectively
by the group leader, a dialogue about
interpersonal connections in general and
conflicts in particular offers an opportunity to
avoid a power struggle and to forge a mutually
growth-enhancing experience.


Frey (2000) described the dialogical process
as one in which participation requires the suspension
of closely held individual or sociocultural
group assumptions. Basic moral and
causal assumptions are exposed for examination,
both by ourselves and by other participants
in the dialogue. Especially crucial to the
process is the substitution of a "both/and"
mode of interaction for an "either/or" framework.
In the either/or mode, the validity of a
particular position rests on its proficiency in
discrediting competing understandings. In the
dialogue or both/and mode, group members
are discouraged from engaging one another to
collect information about competing viewpoints
for the sake of persuasion. Rather,
members seek to establish a more profound
mutual understanding of one another through
learning about their own and others' experiences,
which have shaped self-concepts,

[p. <i>460</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00474&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Intercultural dialogues, however, introduce
challenges not present in dialogical communication
that is confined within a single framework
of cultural knowledge. Two theoretical
perspectives, those of social cognition (e.g.,
Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991) and anxiety/uncertainty
management theory (Gudykunst, 1995),
are useful for elucidating the particularities of
these challenges. The social cognition literature
attends to how individuals use social
information about others, social situations,
and groups to make inferences. Specifically, it
examines processes and strategies employed to
perceive, encode, and integrate social information
to form impressions or conclusions about
others (Markus &amp; Sentis, 1982). Among many
strategies we use to encode, monitor, store,
retrieve, and evaluate information about others
is categorization. Categorization is an
important strategy because it allows us to
structure and give coherence to our general
knowledge about people and the social world,
as well as to offer expectations and explanations
about behavior patterns and common
characteristic actions and attributes (Gudykunst
&amp; Kim, 1997). We categorize or classify based
on physical (e.g., sex, race) or cultural (e.g.,
ethnic background) characteristics, as well as
characteristics less immediately visible to the
perceiver, such as attitudes or personality
traits. Categorization processes, however, are
subject to biases, and these biases lead to
stereotypes, misunderstandings, or conflicts in
a counseling group when, for example, there
exists a discrepancy between a personal social
identity with which a member defines herself
or himself and the manner in which the others
in the group have categorized the member
based on her or his observed characteristics
(Deaux, 1991).


The second perspective, Gudykunst's
(1995) anxiety/uncertainty management theory,
informs intercultural communication through
its focus on the level of uncertainty and anxiety
that accompanies interpersonal interaction.
<i>Uncertainty</i> in this context refers to the
lack of confidence in the prediction of another
interactant's response, whereas <i>anxiety</i> is
defined as an emotional reaction to the expectation
of possible negative consequences. The
amount of cognitive unpredictability and
psychological stress in communication across
sociocultural divides is a function of a broad
range of factors, including prior contact with
others of a similar group affiliation, knowledge
and information about the sociocultural
groups involved and their social identities, and
the interactants' perceptions of similarities or
differences between them. Uncertainty and
anxiety may be reduced, for example, when
one is given information, whether accurate or
Stereotypic, about the common attitudes,
beliefs, value orientations, or norms of a particular
sociocultural group. According to
Gudykunst's theory, greater amounts of
uncertainty and anxiety are associated with
increased interpersonal risk perceived by interactants
in the intercultural dialogue.


This interpersonal risk required of group
members for interpersonal learning to occur
has been identified by Yalom (1995) as a reason
for which interpersonal learning is an
important curative factor in group counseling.
Through an examination of interpersonal
perceptions and interactions, the
counseling group provides opportunities for
members to gain insight into their interpersonal
problems and maladaptive interpersonal
styles and to undergo the corrective
emotional experiences that are crucial for
change to occur (Chen &amp; Mallinckrodt,
2002). This process is accelerated as counselors
focus members on here-and-now interactions
and communications that encourage
self-disclosure and the exchange of feedback
about mutual perceptions.

[p. <i>461</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00475&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Self-Disclosure and Interpersonal Feedback in the Diverse Group</b>

In the context of the group social microcosm,
self-disclosure and feedback promote interpersonal
learning as members begin to identify
their perceptual distortions of others and the
effect that their distortions and stereotypes
have on interactions with other group members
across a host of sociocultural boundaries.
Therefore, properly facilitated, self-disclosure
and interpersonal feedback are effective in
reducing categorization biases, as well as
uncertainty and anxiety associated with intercultural
encounters. Through thoughtful use
of self-disclosure and feedback, misunderstanding
is minimized, and change occurs
more rapidly as members take interpersonal
risks and use interpersonal learning to develop
new ways of relating to others, first with fellow
group members and subsequently with
significant others outside of the group.


<b>Self-Disclosure</b>


Self-disclosure in group communication,
which is central to group change processes
(Corey &amp; Corey, 2002; Yalom, 1995), has been
defined as the willingness to share information
about one's personal states, dispositions, events
of the past, and plans for the future (Derlega &amp;
Berg, 1987). By virtue of its conceptualization
as interactional or dialogical, self-disclosure is
always an interpersonal act, requiring both a
giver and a recipient. In the interpersonally oriented
group, a continuous dialogue is more
likely to occur when the content of disclosure
focuses on personal experiences as opposed to
beliefs or opinions. A discussion of one's views
on religion, abortion, affirmative action, or
other belief-based issues, for instance, tends to
result in a heated debate that changes the tone
of interaction from collaborative to combative
and from inclusive to divisive, regardless of the
salience of the belief in question to particular
members' social identities. Not only would this
occurrence fail to deepen mutual understanding
or change beliefs, but it would also run the risk
of polarizing already divergent viewpoints and
weakening connections within the group.
Conversely, through the retelling of personal
experiences, members learn about each other's
histories, which serve as templates for construing
the world and how these personal histories
and experiences affect relations within the
group. As a result of this process of exchanging
experiences, each interactant's need for control
and reactive defensiveness is minimized.


In the context of the diverse group, the concept
of self-disclosure needs to be broadened
beyond its traditional definition. Self-disclosure
as a form of interpersonal communication is
dictated by cultural group norms, and research
evidence suggests that certain racial and ethnic
minority group members may be less willing to
disclose than White members (Shen, Sanchez,
&amp; Huang, 1984; Sue &amp; Sue, 2003). Ridley's
(1984) two-dimension typology of Black
clients' nondisclosure offers a possible explanation
of this finding. It assesses the nature of
nondisclosure of ethnic minority clients to
White counselors with respect to two dimensions:
<i>cultural paranoia</i> and <i>functional paranoia</i>.
The dimension of cultural paranoia
refers to the degree to which minority clients'
nondisclosure occurs due to fear of misunderstandings
or negative responses from White
counselors, suggesting a healthy and self-protective
function in response to anticipated
racism. Functional paranoia, conversely, pertains
to the degree to which the nondisclosure
of minority clients is motivated by their pervasive
suspicion and distrust in others in general
and counselors in particular, ¡rrespective of
race. On the basis of self-disclosure, a minority
client may fall high or low on each dimension,
yielding four possible disclosure styles:

[p. <i>462</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00476&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

(a) Trusting or intercultural nonparanoiac
discloser: low on both dimensions


(b) Healthy cultural paranoiac: high on
cultural paranoia, low on functional
paranoia


(c) Functional paranoiac: high on functional
paranoia, low on cultural paranoia


(d) Confluent paranoiac: high on both
dimensions


Ridley's (1984) typology is helpful to group
counselors when they facilitate a group in
which there are visible minority group members.
Following this assessment, group counselors
may develop specific disclosure-focused
interventions best matched to the nondisclosure
mode of group counseling clients to
decrease their mistrust and fear. A lack of
awareness of the nature of nondisclosure by a
minority group member would likely increase
the risk of group counselors making erroneous
attributions and implementing ineffective or
counterproductive intervention strategies with
potentially deleterious effects on group dynamics,
cohesion, and future prospects of disclosure
(Fenster &amp; Fenster, 1998).


In discussing self-disclosure, Yalom (1995)
distinguished between vertical and horizontal
disclosures. Vertical disclosure is content based
and focuses on the historical, outside-of-group
information, whereas horizontal disclosure is
here and now, is experience focused, and
emphasizes the dynamic process of the feedback
and disclosure cycle in the group. More
specifically, horizontal disclosure centers on
group members' internal feelings and thoughts,
antecedent, concomitant, and consequent to
the act of disclosing. Horizontal disclosure is
therefore an exploration and expression of the
discloser's normally unexpressed uncertainty
and anxiety about the prediction and anticipation
of others' reactions in the here-and-now
group context. If a member of a women's
group, for example, were to reveal that she is a
lesbian, vertical disclosure would likely include
information about when she first became
aware of her attraction to women, if she has
come out to her friends or family, and other
content details regarding her sexual orientation.
Horizontal disclosure, on the other hand,
would shift focus away from the content and
onto her experience of disclosing at this
moment to this group of women.


Although many writers and researchers
(e.g., Slavin, 1993; Yalom, 1995) have emphasized
horizontal disclosure over vertical disclosure,
the value of vertical disclosure should not
be overlooked in diverse groups. Because the
interpersonal counseling group represents a
microcosm of society, each member of the
diverse group brings with her or him all of the
experiences, feelings, and reactions surrounding
prior encounters with out-group individuals
outside of the group. The past oppression,
prejudice, and discrimination encountered by
members of visible or invisible minority groups
in the United States may contribute to these
individuals' mistrust of majority group members
and counselors (Ridley, 1989). Similarly,
they may perceive the group as a threat to reenact
oppressive societal dynamics of invalidation,
disempowerment, and lack of empathy
and mutuality (Han &amp; Vasquez, 1995).
Consequently, at the beginning stages of group
counseling, individuals who are members of
minority groups may be more cautious about
disclosing information to out-group strangers
than to in-group strangers (Stephan, Stephan,
Wezel, &amp; Cornelius, 1991).


Both minority and majority members of
diverse groups reap the benefits of vertical disclosure,
however. For members who have
experienced various forms of oppression, prejudice,
and discrimination in society, vertical
disclosure, in the form of narratives of personal
histories, is invaluable. It allows their
experiences to be acknowledged and validated.
For majority group members, these disclosures
provide opportunities for them to
examine, recognize, and acknowledge their
privilege and power as members of the majority

[p. <i>463</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00477&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When vertical disclosure is followed by horizontal
disclosure, the group shifts the focus to
how members' connections with others have
been enhanced as a result. A delicate balance
between vertical disclosure and horizontal disclosure
during this dialogical process among
minority and majority group members hence
constitutes the cornerstone on which a counseling
group can begin to construct meaning
and deepen understanding about one another,
thus facilitating a more positive and affirming
sense of members' identities.


Self-disclosure in relation to visible diversity,
as opposed to invisible diversity, tends to
occur first in the group process (Fenster, 1996;
White, 1994). If there were only two men in a
counseling group of eight members, for example,
the gender imbalance would typically be
noted by both men and women. A dialogue
that facilitated the exploration of personal
experience in relation to communicating
across gender divides (vertical disclosure), as
well as the underlying uncertainty and anxiety
that accompany the exploration (horizontal
disclosure), would set the stage for later dialogue
with respect to invisible diversity.
Although self-disclosure at the horizontal and
vertical levels may increase as the group progresses,
self-disclosure is neither a static nor
linear concept. It is, in essence, a cyclical
process. Ideally, both disclosers and receivers
build their trust and connections during this
process, thus encouraging more interpersonal
risks and a more fluid exchange of ongoing
disclosure and feedback.


<b>Interpersonal Feedback</b>


The extant group counseling empirical
literature, based on both subjective participant
evaluation and process-outcome research, has
consistently found feedback to be one of the
most crucial variables to the change process in
group counseling (Butler &amp; Fuhriman, 1980;
Flowers &amp; Booarem, 1989; Kivlighan, 1985;
Kivlighan et al., 2000; Tschuschke &amp; Dies,
1997). Cohen (2000) defined interpersonal
feedback as "sequences in which a participant,
as feedback <i>donor</i>, responds to another,
the <i>recipient</i>, so as to let the recipient know
how her or his behavior has affected the
<i>donor</i>" (pp. 167-168). An important element
of Cohen's intersubjective conceptualization
of feedback is the assertion that by emphasizing
both the experience of the feedback donor
and the behavior of the feedback recipient,
group members are empowered to see other
members as they see themselves. In the diverse
group, an intersubjective understanding of the
process of feedback allows members to understand
events in the group through the eyes of
other members. The focus of the group shifts
from the content of the feedback provided by
the donor member regarding another member's
behavior, to the initial reaction of the
donor member that led to the decision to share
the feedback, and, finally, to the experiences
of this member that have likely evoked the
reaction. This bidirectional understanding of
feedback assists members in creating mutual
understandings of experiences and realities
and, in doing so, correcting what Cohen
referred to as "idealizing" or "demonizing"
stereotypes.


Empirical research in social psychology
focusing on the valence and timing of feedback
suggests that positive feedback is important
for building group cohesion in the initial
stages of group formation. Early in the group,
positive feedback tends to be more accepted by
members than negative feedback in terms of
credibility, desirability, and impact. Group
members who receive high levels of both positive
and negative feedback and who are able to
provide both positive and negative feedback to
other members are most likely to achieve

[p. <i>464</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00478&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the diverse group, factors such as societal
norms that discourage the exploration of
divergent understandings between members of
different sociocultural groups complicate the
delivery and acceptance of both positive and
negative feedback. Evidence suggests that differences
between people from different sociocultural
groups tend to be viewed as reflecting
profound, immutable group-level differences
rather than individual-level differences (Miller
&amp; Prentice, 1999). Crocker and colleagues
(Crocker &amp; Major, 1989; Crocker, Voelkl,
Testa, &amp; Major, 1991) have found that due to
the attributional ambiguity of both positive
and negative feedback delivered from White
majority culture members, Blacks and other
minority group members are likely to be wary
of feedback from Whites. In the case of positive
feedback, a member of a minority or stigmatized
group may be uncertain whether the
positive feedback occurred because of the
merit of her or his behavior or, rather, from
other motives, such as a desire not to appear
prejudiced on the part of the White deliverer
of feedback. When the feedback is negative,
however, individuals of stigmatized groups
may attribute the feedback to prejudice when
such an attribution is plausible. This is consistent
with Kelley's (1972) hypothesis that members
of stigmatized groups tend to attribute
negative feedback to prejudice rather than to a
realistic appraisal of merit so as to protect self-esteem
in a racist environment.


The findings from the aforementioned
research are informative for leaders of diverse
groups. Although positive feedback is a critical
component in the development of group
cohesion, it is a combination of negative and
positive feedback delivery and receipt that is
found to be predictive of change in group counseling
(Kivlighan, 1985). Negative feedback
delivered by majority group members or leaders,
however, may not be well received by group
members from minority or stigmatized groups
due, in part, to uncertainty as to whether the
criticism stems from their own actual behavior
or because of negative stereotyping. Minority
group members may also be reluctant to deliver
corrective feedback due to uncertainty and
anxiety about resultant negative stereotyping by
majority group members. Spencer, Fein, Wolfe,
Fong, and Dunn (1998), for instance, found that
the receipt of negative feedback tends to make
receivers of the feedback more likely to activate
negative racial stereotypes when the feedback
donor is a member of a minority group.


The exchange of feedback as a dialogue
presents a formidable task for both the feedback
donor and receiver and requires their
willingness to stay engaged in this process.
Unsolicited feedback from a group member
with whom there is limited trust formed is
likely to be rejected or devalued, regardless of
whether the feedback is positive or negative. In
a similar vein, a member may hesitate to give
complete and honest feedback to another
member in the presence of a high level of
uncertainty and anxiety about the receiver's
reaction. With the assistance of the group
leader, however, members may develop skills
that allow them to deliver and receive feedback
that is specific, is contextualized, and focuses
on one's experience and the experienced
impact of other group members' behavior--
cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally.


<b>Integration of Self-Disclosure
and Interpersonal Feedback</b>


Han and Vasquez (1995) focused on two
sociocultural realities likely to be present in the
context of group counseling involving racial
and ethnic minorities: unique cultural needs

[p. <i>465</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00479&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second sociocultural reality may be
understood as an interaction between the reality
of the majority culture and the experience of
the minority group within it. Specifically,
implicit or explicit experiences of oppression,
prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization
influence disclosure and the exchange of feedback
between majority and minority culture
members in the social microcosm of the group.
In the here-and-now context of interpersonal
group counseling, intermember learning
depends greatly on the willingness of members
to enter into one another's multiple realities.
Yalom (1995) discussed the vital role of interpersonal
feedback in the "self-reflective looping"
process, through which here-and-now
behavior in the group is examined and interpersonal
learning occurs. Through feedback, a
member's behavior and its effect on others are
recognized and pointed out by other members,
providing the member in question with an
opportunity to better understand the behavior,
as well as its interpersonal ramifications.
Through self-disclosure, not only are members
exposed to others' extragroup and intragroup
experiences, but they are also called on to
examine their conceptualization of what constitutes
diversity, as well as their understandings
of and reactions to similarity and dissimilarity.


In light of these sociocultural realities, dialogue
provides opportunities for group members
to share their experiences with each other
in a manner that validates these experiences
while challenging them to understand different
realities. Within the dialogic framework, self-disclosure
and feedback exchanges gradually
blend into one another. In the process, members
are challenged to alter or expand deeply
held beliefs and assumptions that are found to
be incongruent with previously unconsidered
realities presented by other group members.
Confronting one's stereotypes and established
beliefs at the intrapersonal and interpersonal
levels creates uncertainty and anxiety for the
whole group as it endeavors to make a "risky
shift" (Wallach, Kogan, &amp; Bern, 1962) toward
a meaningful web of interpersonal connections.
The creation of a sense of trust that the
experiences of each member are valid and will
not be subjugated to the realities and experiences
of others enables members to tolerate
these cognitive and affective reactions to self-disclosure
and feedback exchange. Under the
guidance of the leader, members engage in a
collaborative, reciprocal dialogue as they venture
into identifying interior territories of
other members.

<b>Implications for Multiculturally Competent Group Counselors</b>

The MCCM has been widely adopted as a
yardstick against which the competence of

[p. <i>466</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00480&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Applied to the communication within the
group, Chen's (2001) view is consistent with
Howell's (1982) perspective that the process
of improving one's communication with others
progresses through four stages: (a) <i>unconscious
incompetence</i>, whereby individuals
misinterpret others' behavior but are not
aware of the bias; (b) <i>conscious incompetence</i>,
whereby individuals are aware of the misinterpretation
of others' behavior but fail to correct
this error; (c) <i>conscious competence</i>, whereby
communication errors and behaviors are consciously
and actively modified and improved;
and (d) <i>unconscious competence</i>, whereby individuals
practice the skills for effective communication
to the extent that they need not think
about them to use them. In this view, the multiculturally
competent group counselor is characterized
as a professional with both awareness
and commitment to expand the boundaries of
her or his multicultural competence.


Aside from awareness of one's own identity
at the universal, group, and personal levels
(Kluckhohn &amp; Murray, 1953; Turner, 1987),
the multiculturally competent group counselor
remains cognizant of how various forms of
oppression, prejudice, discrimination, and
stereotyping affect her or him personally and,
thus, her or his interpretation of the group
process. The group leader must challenge and
appraise the preconceived impressions or
assumptions about minority group members
in the context of her or his own cultural
upbringing and beliefs, discarding myths of
universality or homogeneity of experience and
understanding the effects of her or his own
worldviews on the evaluation of group members
and the group process (Brook et al., 1998;
Tsui &amp; Schultz, 1988). Through this process
of self-examination, a sense of "mindfulness"
(Langer, 1989) or "cultural sensitivity"
(Ridley, Mendoza, Kanitz, Angermeier, &amp;
Zenk, 1994) helps the group leader to minimize
the biases of categorization or stereotyping
and to avoid operating in an automatic,
habitual manner. When open to new information
and characteristics associated with
the cultural contexts of the members and
group, the interventions of the group leader
are less likely to be guided and constrained
by her or his Stereotypic beliefs and assumptions.
In the remainder of this section, this
process is further examined within the context
of the four leadership roles described by
Yalom (1995): the roles of participant-observer,
norm shaper, historian, and technical
expert.


<b>Group Leader as Participant-Observer</b>


Participant observation in the context of
social science research is conceptualized not
as a particular research technique but rather
as a manner of "being-in-the-world" that is
necessary for carrying out useful social
research (Atkinson &amp; Hammersley, 1994).
The challenge for the researcher as participant-observer
is to be able to understand an
event from the perspective of an insider,
including the effects of one's own involvement,

[p. <i>467</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00481&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At the member-leader interaction level, the
group leader attends to the significance of her
or his role from the perspective of minority
group members. For instance, group members
who adhere to Asian cultural group norms
may, compared with majority culture members,
tend to relate to the group leader as an
authoritative figure rather than as a process
facilitator (Tsui &amp; Schultz, 1988). Similarly,
minority group members, whose reality often
consists of experiences of oppression, prejudice,
and discrimination in society (Han &amp;
Vasquez, 1995), may be particularly sensitive
to the combined power of a leader who is a
member of the majority culture as well as an
authority in the group.


At the group level, the leader as a participant-observer
of the dialogical process focuses
on how uncertainty and anxiety affect the
interaction or, more specifically, prevent an
effective dialogue from taking place. Racial
and ethnic minority group members, for
example, may experience a sense of distrust,
vulnerability, and lack of inclusion in a group
composed predominantly of Whites, who may
not attend to the racial or ethnic differences
within the group, perhaps due to a lack of
awareness or to fear of being labeled as culturally
insensitive. Not surprisingly, then, in a
racially mixed group, members may collude
within their group to avoid an exploration
of these issues by means of one of several
strategies (Helms &amp; Cook, 1999): (a) using
imprecise terms such as <i>culture</i> and other
euphemisms as opposed to race to depict out-group
individuals; (b) using <i>they</i> and <i>we</i> to
refer to specific racial out-group and in-group
members, respectively; (c) shifting the group's
focus to safer issues; and (d) neutralizing the
topic to reduce consideration of the racial or
cultural aspects of an interaction.


On the other hand, members may make an
attempt to explore these differences, which,
when not monitored appropriately, may lead
to misunderstanding or conflicts due to differences
in the recognition and expression of
emotions or in cognitive and interpersonal
styles.


Recognizing these potential difficulties,
Cheng, Chae, and Gunn (1998) encouraged
the leader with a focus on group-level interactions
to explore questions such as the following:
How might similarities and differences
among group members influence the level or
style of participation? Relative to maintenance
functions, do certain members constantly
interrupt or cut off other members from different
cultures or backgrounds? Relative to
task functions, to what degree is there an
exchange of information, ideas, views, and
feedback between members of different cultural
backgrounds? Is there any unique connection
formed based on similarities or
differences in sociocultural identity? To what
extent is the emphasis of interaction placed on
seeking and giving information or opinions
(discussion mode), as opposed to an exchange
of personal experience and hidden meanings
(dialogue mode)?

[p. <i>468</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00482&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Group Leader as Norm Shaper</b>


Yalom (1995) stressed the far-reaching,
pervasive influence of the group leader on
shaping norms. The foundation of group
norms that are constructed early on will most
likely guide the members' interactions
throughout the life span of the group, influencing
the processes of disclosure and feedback,
as well as the level of acceptance and
value allocated to diverse worldviews and life
experiences. The therapeutic group norms
designed to help members navigate the group
experience, however, are typically in line with
White majority culture values and expectations
(Cheng et al., 1998; Tsui &amp; Schultz,
1988). These norms resist intrusion and are
likely to either exclude minority group members
or demand that they adapt to interactional
patterns that are incongruent with their
own cultural norms. Although most group
leaders have been trained to facilitate the discussion
of feelings, disclosure, feedback, and
direct confrontation of conflict, members of
minority cultural backgrounds may not understand
these norms or feel comfortable participating
in interactions based on these
expectations (Brook et al., 1998).


In light of the different realities of members,
particularly those from minority cultural
groups, it is incumbent on the multiculturally
competent group counselor to ensure that the
social microcosm of the group does not simply
replicate societal norms of oppression, prejudice,
and discrimination faced by both visible
and invisible minority group members and that
serve to denigrate, exclude, and silence members
of these groups. By understanding how
valence, timing, and cognitive and affective risk
factors affect both the giving and receiving of
feedback in a diverse group, the group leader
facilitates the replacement of divisive societal
norms with a dialogical norm of interaction
through which the mutual comprehension of
diverse experiences may take place.


In facilitating the development of mutual
understandings, the multiculturally competent
group leader endeavors to address the points
of tension that exist in relation to norms on
three different levels: those of the group, those
of the majority culture, and those of minority
cultures. Presenting the group with information
about potential clashes or inconsistencies
among these three norms would help group
members to better understand other members'
behaviors at the group, interpersonal, and
intrapersonal levels, thus minimizing inaccurate
attributions. To maintain a dialogical
process and facilitate communication across
diversity, group members need to acknowledge
the norm of multiple realities. Instead of
assessing the degree of validity of members'
realities, the challenge for the group is to determine
how to communicate in the context of a
diversity of personal experiences. Through
dialogue, group members can obtain information
about other members without relying on
stereotypes. The sharing of how different
members experience the same group event differently,
facilitated by a combination of
descriptive horizontal and explanatory vertical
disclosures, serves to reduce uncertainty and
anxiety, triggering a spiraling process of open
communication and interpersonal learning.


To mitigate the debilitating effects of
monocultural norms on the cohesion of
diverse groups, group leaders need to elicit
reactions from all group members about their
perceptions and expectations of group counseling.
Group leaders should take an active
role in forging functional group norms that are
consonant with the various cultural backgrounds
and expectations of group members,
thus bridging the power differential between
majority and minority group members (Tsui &amp;
Schultz, 1988). Through modeling intercultural
curiosity, sensitivity to diversity, and self-disclosure,
group leaders help the group develop
norms under which differences across socio-cultural
boundaries are viewed as opportunities

[p. <i>469</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00483&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Group Leader as Historian</b>


As group historian, the group counselor
maintains a temporal perspective, recalling the
original goals of each group member, as well
as serving to integrate the unfolding of related
events over time in the group (Yalom, 1995).
The skilled leader of the diverse group, however,
needs to further expand on this role, both
with respect to understanding the group
process and individual members' behaviors, as
well as facilitating the vertical disclosure necessary
for mutual understanding of members'
diverse experiences. Consistent with the
MCCM, Fenster (1996) asserted that to determine
the extent to which behaviors of group
members are symptomatic or culturally congruent,
the group counselor must have some
familiarity with the cultural norms of the
minority group members. Fenster compared
the group counselor to an archeologist, who,
prior to embarking on the excavation of a site,
would not neglect to study the history of the
people who lived there. An archeologist, however,
studies historic cultures and is not interactive
in her or his approach. For these
reasons, the task of the group leader as historian
is perhaps better described as similar to
that of an anthropologist, who, based on the
accumulation of observations as a participant-observer,
must formulate theories of how
moment-to-moment events and interactions
are related to the histories of the members,
individually and as a group.


A mere curiosity of the history of the member
as an individual and as a member of the
cultural group would not be of much use,
however, if this history were not used to facilitate
the type of vertical disclosure necessary
for the formation of group dialogue and
mutual understanding of diverse experiences.
Although a here-and-now horizontal focus of
disclosure is necessary for effective group
counseling, vertical disclosure takes on a more
important role in the diverse group, in which
members are likely to have very different
upbringings, experiences, values, and perspectives.
The mult¡culturally skilled counselor
hence has the responsibility of facilitating the
sharing of members' past experiences so that
other members can begin to relate emotionally
to and understand these experiences. White
members, who are unlikely to be able to identify
with the experience of racial discrimination,
for example, may more clearly understand
a minority group member's disclosure concerning
her or his difficulty trusting these
members if the leader can facilitate the disclosure
of life experiences that have provoked
these feelings. Tsui and Schultz (1988) argued
that acknowledging and validating the unique
life experiences of minority group members
and the connection of these experiences with
the realities of our culturally diverse society
prevent these experiences from being marginalized
in the group and help group members
move toward empathic, universal emotional
response. They further argued that establishing
the ability to respond in a unified manner
to the often painful experiences of other members
allows cohesion to develop in a group
composed of members with diverse histories
and life experiences.


<b>Group Leader as Technical Expert</b>


The role of the group leader as technical
expert refers to the application of specific techniques
used to shape the norms and direction
of the group (Yalom, 1995). In the diverse group,
the crucial role of the counselor as technical

[p. <i>470</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00484&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With the goal of facilitating the dialogical
process, the leader deliberately plans and
designs the conditions and norms necessary
for self-disclosure and feedback to readily
occur. Effective skills tend to fall into two
major categories: caring and meaning attribution.
<i>Caring</i> refers to those skills that allow
members to experience warmth, support, and
empathy from others in the group, whereas
<i>meaning attribution</i> skills focus on gaining a
cognitive understanding of meanings embedded
in interpersonal interactions. When the
interactions within the group seem to move
toward the direction of nonengagement (Gass
&amp; Varonis, 1991), for instance, the leader may
empathize with both majority and minority
cultural group members' cognitive uncertainty
and stress associated with self-disclosure and
feedback. Through the increase of perceived
similarity in this respect among the members,
the curative value of universality in this context
enables the members to open themselves
to others' experience. Another skill in the
meaning attribution category involves making
process commentaries (Yalom, 1995) oriented
toward difficulties that the group is having in
addressing issues of diversity. Still another
may be to educate the group as to how the
norms and expectations--at the majority culture,
minority culture, and group levels--may
affect the nature and direction of interactions
with others. In doing so, both caring and
understanding are communicated to members
whose multiple realities are acknowledged and
affirmed in the social microcosm of the multicultural
group counseling experience.

<b>Case Vignette</b>

In the fifth session of an interpersonal counseling
group led by a therapist in private practice
and composed of five racial and ethnic
minorities and three White members, Robert,
a 39-year-old Black manager of a technology
sales department, complained that he had been
passed over for a promotion again. He further
told the members, all in their late 30s to early
50s, that a young White man whose department
had been less profitable than Robert's
had received the promotion to which Robert
had aspired. Robert concluded his description
of the events by saying that he felt that he had
been the victim of racist promotion practices
by the management of his company and that
this was not the first time that White colleagues
with inferior track records to his had
been promoted ahead of him. Several of the
minority members of the group offered comments
in support of Robert's assessment of
what had happened. Rafael, a son of
Ecuadorian immigrants, who taught math at a
local community college, suggested that
Robert investigate the possibility of a lawsuit
against the company--Robert had nothing to
lose in filing a lawsuit, as he was already
"banging his head against the glass ceiling."


During the interchange, the three White
members remained silent until the group counselor,
Jessica, a 45-year-old White woman,
noted their lack of participation and invited
them to explore their reactions to Robert's
complaint of racial discrimination. Susan, the
manager of a local restaurant, stated that as a
White woman, she did not feel it was her place
to share her thoughts about racism as it did
not affect her. She added that she was unsure
that this was a case of racism and wondered if

[p. <i>471</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00485&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After a long, awkward silence, the group
leader, Jessica, acknowledged that although
she had not personally experienced the negative
effects of racism, she felt that it significantly
affected the lives of the minority
members of the group. She also suggested that,
although often unrecognized, racism also limits
the lives of majority members. She then
asked group members if they would share their
experiences with racism. In response, Rafael
recalled an incident that occurred when he
transferred schools at the age of 16 and his
father, who spoke English with an accent, had
attempted to enroll him in the honors classes
at his new school. Despite his academic
achievements and honors placement at his former
school, the school administrator suggested
that the academic level at the new
school was "rigorous" and that Rafael would
"surely do better" in the regular core curriculum.
It was not until several weeks into the
school year, when a teacher recognized
Rafael's abilities and advocated for him, that
Rafael was placed into the proper classes.


Other minority members described their
experiences with racism. Robert reminded the
group that these instances only scratched the
surface and compared them to leaks in a
pipeline, with the full current running hidden
underneath. Jessica, the counselor, asked them
how it felt to share these experiences with the
group. Several of the minority members
expressed concern that, although they felt supported
by the other minority group members,
they were still not sure how these stories
would be received by the White members.
Jessica then invited them to direct this question
to the White members.


Geoffrey, one of the White members,
disclosed that he was also uncomfortable and
unsure about how to proceed. Although recognizing
the stifling nature of racism, he typically
tried to "walk around this issue" due, in
part, to his own personal feelings of guilt. He
gave the example of when he and a Black
friend had gone separately to apply for a job at
the same place during their college years. His
friend had been grilled extensively about taking
a year off from classes and asked to provide
a thorough explanation of what he had
done and where he had been during the year.
In the end, his friend was not offered a job, but
Geoffrey was quickly given a job despite having
also been away for the past year. Robert
thanked Geoffrey for recognizing the reality
faced by him and other minority group members.


At this point, Linda stated that, although
not a racial minority herself, she similarly
experienced the adverse effects of oppression
and discrimination as a lesbian woman. Rafael
questioned whether Linda had experienced the
same level of oppression as the racial and
ethnic minorities in the group, arguing that
nobody would know that she was a lesbian
unless she decided to tell them. A heated
debate began to develop until Linda, in
response to the leader's invitation to recall
some of her experiences, talked about feeling
marginalized. For example, when she came
out to people whom she had considered
friends, they had assured her that "it didn't
matter," only to later distance themselves
from Linda. Several episodes like this had left
her wary about forming close relationships
with individuals outside of the lesbian and gay
community. Jessica, the group counselor, then
asked Linda what made her decide to come
out to the group in this session. She responded
that the manner in which the group had
processed issues of racism and oppression
encouraged her to disclose, despite her fears of
the group keeping her at an arm's distance.

[p. <i>472</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00486&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Shortly before the end of the session, the
group leader commented that the voices of
minorities often go unheard and that dialogue
on various forms of prejudice is typically
avoided. For this reason, she was moved by
their tangible support for one another and by
their willingness to take risks through self-disclosure
and feedback exchange, despite
their anxiety and feelings of vulnerability.


<b>Analysis</b>


The interactions depicted in this interpersonal
group are not uncommon in racially
mixed groups. Societal norms in the United
States typically discourage the open recognition
of visible differences between members of
different racial or ethnic groups, particularly
between members of majority and minority
groups. Following her observation of the
emergence of subgrouping along racial lines,
the group leader took a step toward shaping a
norm of open communication about diversity
by recognizing that the minority and majority
group members may have been experiencing
the interaction differently.


The group, replicating larger social norms,
initially moved toward a discussion as to
whether Robert's experience was indeed a case
of racism or, on a larger scale, as to the dimensions
of racism on a societal level. The leader,
however, suggested that members share their
experiences with racism, or vertically disclose.
In a diverse group in which the members have
had dissimilar experiences outside of the
group, vertical disclosure is helpful in providing
a context for understanding and empathy.
Once minority members had disclosed their
experiences with racism, the leader of this
group encouraged horizontal disclosure, and
members shared their feelings of vulnerability
and fear that their experiences would not be
validated. As a result of the process of moving
from vertical to horizontal disclosure,
Geoffrey, one of the White members of the
group, also expressed discomfort and feelings
of guilt he had around the issue of race and
oppression. This dialogue facilitated the additional
disclosure and set the stage for beneficial
interpersonal feedback to occur in future
interactions.


As often occurs in diverse groups, this
group addressed issues of visible diversity
prior to realizing that they may have been
diverse in less visible ways as well. Linda's disclosure
as a lesbian was initially minimized by
a racial minority member of the group. By
seeking to determine if Linda's reported experience
of oppression was comparable to that of
the visible minority members, the group ran
the risk of engaging itself in the communication
mode of intellectual discussion. By inviting
Linda to share some of her experiences, the
leader helped move the group from a debate
on the merits of her experience to a dialogue
with the goal of simply understanding her subjective
experience. As a consequence, Linda's
disclosure was met with empathy and validation
from other group members. The leader's
process commentary further communicated
her caring and helped members understand the
meanings of these interactions. Furthermore, it
shaped and underscored the importance of the
norm of mutual respect and openness in future
dialogues.

<b>Implications for Training</b>

With the rapid demographic, social, and cultural
changes in our society, group counselors
can no longer afford to blindly employ theories
that are disconnected from the realities of
group counseling clients. As this chapter has
demonstrated, group counselors face complex
and, at times, overwhelming challenges as they
strive to provide quality care in the murky
context of diversity. For this, reason, we
emphasize the need for group counselors to

[p. <i>473</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284023-I00487&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Training programs that attempt to develop
the multicultural competence of group counselors
may build on conceptual work in the
multicultural counselor training literature
that falls into one of two categories. The
first includes models that are comprehensive
in focus and content, as exemplified by
Ridley et al.'s (1994) Multicultural Program
Development Pyramid (MPDP). The MPDP
details a grid in which 10 learning objectives
intersect with 10 instructional strategies. The
MPDP may serve as a template for the development
of a series of graded learning activities
and experiences for group counselors. The second
category includes approaches or models
that are specific in goals, focus, and content.
Clinical supervision is a good example. For
clinical supervisors who intend to enhance
their supervisees' multicultural competence in
group counseling, several approaches may be
adapted for this purpose (e.g., Chen, 2001;
Constantine, 1997; Martinez &amp; Holloway,
1997). In designing training experiences for
supervisees, the supervisor is concerned with
questions that are both content focused and
pedagogical (Chen, in press): "<i>How</i> do I help
my supervisees know <i>what</i> they need to know
and, further, transfer that knowledge into
practice?"


Among the existing perspectives in the second
category, Chen's (2001) interactional
approach to clinical supervision may be a
good link between the principles of our dialogical
perspective and the multicultural training
and supervision of group counselors.
Central to this approach are interpersonal
communications as a window into the nature
of interpersonal relationships and into the
character of the interacting participants.
Adapted to the context of group counseling
supervision, this approach may be modified by
the supervisor in the supervision of group
trainees, individually or as a group. The supervision
group as a "social microcosm" (Yalom,
1995), in particular, provides a context
whereby sociocultural roles and expectations
may be explored and negotiated. The group
supervisor of trainees hence has the benefit of
fostering a multilayered analysis that penetrates
interpersonal relationships and enhances
the opportunity for increased sensitivity and
appreciation for diversity issues (Chen, in
press). With diversity-related "critical incidents"
generated from the trainee for exploration,
each supervision session is a reflective
inquiry process that aims at helping group
counselor trainees to develop a sense of intentionality
and a reflective stance in their own
practice. Within a supportive yet challenging
supervision context, trainees may examine
and challenge their tacit and unwarranted

In closing, incorporating diversity into the
practice and training of group counselors is
not an easy task. In this chapter, we have proposed
a perspective to working with diverse
counseling groups that underscores the importance
of communication as a means through
which visible and invisible differences between
members can be addressed. Integral to this
perspective is the conceptualization of diversity
in the group counseling process--not as an
entity, but rather as sustained through interaction
and moderated by self-disclosure and
feedback. Counseling group members' conceptualizations
of what constitutes diversity, as
well as their understanding of and reactions to
similarity and dissimilarity, cycle through the
events of the group. The intense emotions that
accompany diversity issues often leave the
group reluctant and vulnerable in exploring
their differences. Invariably, this dialogical
process hinges on, to a large extent, the level of
multicultural competence of the group counselor
in assisting members in negotiating and
managing interpersonal risks and vulnerabilities.
Group counseling practice and, by extension,
counseling supervision are embedded in
multiple sociocultural realities and therefore
have social and political consequences. In the
presence of the group counselor who commits
to the fostering of interpersonal learning
through the exploration of diversity, group
members will likely be rewarded with more
meaningful connections rooted in the celebration
of human similarities, as well as human
differences.
