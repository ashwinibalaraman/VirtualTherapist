<i>For the next few years, we see my parents infrequently,</i>
only for some holidays. We focus on our marriage, continuing therapy,
and improvements in our relationship ebb and flow.


The Auburn years approach their ending. Mary Anne moves to
Macon, Georgia, where she develops both a marriage and family therapy
training program and a curriculum for teaching family therapy
to family practice residents at Mercer University School of Medicine.
Pat is transferred to a teaching position at Mary Immaculate Seminary
in Pennsylvania. I earn my degree and work at a pastoral counseling
agency until Peter is offered a promotion and we move to Roswell,
Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, where I join a private practice.


I resume individual therapy with Mary Anne once a week. The
round-trip drive from Roswell to Macon takes almost five hours, but
I leave home before the children get ready for school and I'm back
before they get off the bus. It's worth it. Through the psychodynamics
of our therapeutic relationship, I experience Mary Anne's psychological
reparenting, and notice how it enriches my competence
as a mother. I'm more sensitive, more emotionally available, more
attuned to the needs of my girls. Claire is now eleven; Beth, ten;
Annie, nine; and Rose, five--the age range of my siblings and me
when our family dynamics began their sharp decline and Mother's
alcoholism advanced.

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>December 1985. Mary Anne is diagnosed with breast</i>
cancer, and both Mom and Dad are admitted to the hospital, all within
forty-eight hours. Paul has moved to Orlando, pursuing a childhood
dream of becoming an actor. Andrew is overseas on sabbatical. Lucy's
still in Brooklyn. I'm called as next of kin to respond to my parents'
health crises, and I decide not to tell them I'm coming.


"Hi! How's my mother doing?" I ask, peeking into her hospital
room. She's pale and thin, gray hair disheveled. Much to my surprise,
she starts crying.


"Oh... Catherine!" she exclaims, reaching out her hand. I walk
over and bend to kiss her, cupping my warm hands around her shaking
fingers.


"I don't want to be rude, Cath, but the doctor just gave me a
sedative and I might doze off," she says in a weak voice, as if she's
never been rude to me before. "They're putting a pacemaker in this
afternoon."


"Yes, Ma, I know. I'll just keep you company until the nurse
comes to get you."


I pull up a chair and sit down, stroking her hand on my lap
while she sleeps, grateful she's allowing it. But I'm confused. Thus
far, our relationship conflicts have been the primary focus of my individual
therapy. Is the love I feel for her--and the absence of anger,
panic, fears of going crazy--a sign that I've worked things through?
Or, with Mary Anne ill, am I transferring my affection for her onto
Mom? My heart tells me to stop questioning. This moment has been
hard-earned.


I think back to five months ago when Peter and I had taken the
girls to visit my parents at their house for the first time in more than
two years. Mom and Dad had become increasingly reclusive, sabotaging
every effort we'd made to connect, either by declining at the outset
or canceling at the last minute. So it was hard to believe they were
finally agreeing to our visit. But the plans were confirmed, and we
departed with optimism on a hot, humid summer morning. And then
the air conditioner in our station wagon died just south of Atlanta.

[p. <i>135</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Do we have to go to Grandma and Grandpa's?" Claire had
whined. "I want to stay with my friends."


"I sure hope Grandma and Grandpa have air-conditioning," Beth
added only a moment later.


"Yeah," Annie said.


I knew their reactions were typical for their ages, then fourteen,
thirteen, and twelve. And they had every reason not to care about visiting
grandparents who'd never even sent them birthday cards. But Peter
and I were in agreement about the importance of making the trip; it had
been the only thing we'd agreed upon lately. The progress we'd made in
marital therapy back in Auburn seemed to backslide after we moved to
Roswell. Again, I felt a missing connection between us, and it seemed
like I hardly ever saw him. When he wasn't at work or coaching the
girls' ball teams--an activity that was good for them and one that I
supported--he was glued to the TV or computer. On the rare nights he
was home for supper, he'd finish his meal before I even had a chance to
sit down at the table, and he never seemed to want to be bothered with
disciplining the children. The kids decided he was the fun one, and I
was an old bitch because I held them to their responsibilities. At thirty-seven,
I felt trapped in my prime, and I wondered if Mom had felt
the same when I was a teenager. I remembered her walking around the
house holding a beer, singing Peggy Lee's song "Is That All There Is?"


When we arrived at Mom and Dad's, nobody answered the doorbell.
I rang again and again, my heart sinking with each attempt. "Go
away--we're not up to seeing you," Dad finally shouted through the
door. "Your mother is not well!"


"Mom not being well isn't a reason to keep us apart, Dad! Let me
in. We've driven all the way down here in a car without air-conditioning.
At least let us get a glass of water."


Still there was no response, and I burst into tears as I returned to
the car.


We checked into a motel. There was a pool, and we thought we
might be able to salvage a good time for our family, but I couldn't
stop crying.

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Peter kept prodding me to forget my parents and get busy having
fun. "Just leave me alone, Peter. You and the kids go swim. I'll be out
later," I said. I was so sick of his "keeping busy" philosophy of life, I
wanted to scream. Part of me hated him; part of me wished he would
just hold me.


"This is the last fucking time we're coming to see these assholes,"
he said. "All they ever do is hurt you, and they don't give a shit about
their grandchildren." He slammed the door on his way out.


I dialed the phone and Mom answered. "Mom, I want to talk to
you," I said.


"No, not now. Goodbye." She hung up.


For years, I'd been convinced that she drank because she didn't
care about anybody. Now, I realized what power that way of thinking
gave to her alcoholism and their craziness--it kept us away. And
it kept me believing that she didn't love me. Well, not this time. I
grabbed the little pencil and pad near the phone and began writing:


<i>Mother,</i>


<i>You hung up before I could tell you I love you, like the phone was a hot
object you had to get out of your hands before you burned. Sometimes
I miss you so much. I just yearn to sit in your presence for five minutes.
The older I get and the older the girls get, the more I have glimpses of
who you might really be, and I see similarities to myself. Andrew and
Lucy and Paul's lives are so different from mine, and mine is so similar
to yours</i>.


<i>Who would know better than you about the struggles of being in a
marriage with the responsibilities and anxieties of rearing and launching
four children? Who would know better than you about how disappointing
a husband can be? Who would understand how trapped a
woman can feel more than you would?</i>


<i>Lately, I keep wishing you and I could talk together, about who we
are and how it's been for us. But you never let me see you, and it grieves
me. I've been crying ever since Dad sent me away</i>.



[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>If I could have things the way I want, you and I would sit together
like fiends, seeing each other as we really are, and loving each other. That
would be heaven to me. Why do you keep refusing to see me?</i>


<i>love always,<br />
Catherine XO</i>


<i>"Mrs. McCall, it's just about time for your mother's</i>
surgery. You'll have to leave in a moment."


The nurse's gentle voice interrupts my thoughts, inviting me back
into the present. While waiting to be ushered out of her room, I recall
Mom's note, which arrived after I had given up hope of a response.
Her handwriting was a barely legible scribble. I wondered whether it
was caused by the pain and stiffness of arthritis or the tremor of alcoholism,
but her words assured me that there was still a chance for us.


<i>Dear Cath,</i>


<i>Sorry am so late in answering your "heart" note. I have read it over and
over with love. I sounded like I did on the phone because I wasn't so well
that morning and to have to say no to visits was more than I could take.
I promise to write in detail on a day when the fingers work better. I often
plan a nice walk with you as we talk fiend to friend</i>.


<i>'Til later,<br />
Love, of course<br />
Mom</i>

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Take good care of her!" I call to the nurses as they wheel her out
of the room. <i>Keep her alive. We need more time</i>.


<i>Dad is roaming around his room in a hospital gown when</i>
I arrive.


"Cath! Cath! So good to see you, sweetheart! Thank you for coming,
Catherine Girl," he says, sounding as if it were always great to see
me, as if he had never in his life refused to see me.


His genitals are vaguely visible, flapping under the cotton of
his hospital gown, as he walks in front of the sunlit window and approaches
me. He pats me on the shoulder and plants an old-man-smelling
kiss on my cheek, his unshaven stubble rubbing against my
face like sandpaper.


"Hi, Dad. Good to see ya," I respond automatically, reaching for
a tissue on the nightstand so that I can wipe his saliva from my face.
I feel nauseated. My heart pounds, and I wonder if I'm going to hyperventilate,
but as I hear him rambling on, I'm swept away from my
feelings and into my childhood role of trying to understand Daddy.


"Your mother has a prolapsed uterus, you know, Cath. <i>Your</i> birth
caused it. You had a very large head, sweetheart." He walks over to
his bed and lies on top of the covers while I approach the window,
looking at the outside view so I can avoid the sight of him. "I've been
catheterized, Catherine Girl. <i>Cathe</i>terized. Isn't that a coincidence?"


I imagine his legs are spread apart, exposed, for me to see his
penis with the tube in it. I'm angry.


"Why aren't you looking at me, Cath, dear? Why do you keep
looking out that window?"


"I'm waiting for you to put the covers on yourself." My voice is
calm, firm, like a mother taking charge of her two-year-old's unruly
behavior. But inside I feel tense, the pit of my stomach tight with fear.


"Oh, I see, dear. Okay, if that's the way you want it."


"That's the way I want it, Dad."


I hear him adjust the covers.

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00148&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The covers are on, dear. Everything's okay now."


I turn around as if I'm rewarding a toddler for socially acceptable
behavior.


"I've been terribly depressed since 1970, you know, Cath. Or
maybe you don't know. How could you know? There's been a tremendous
lull in my life since then. Fifteen years, Cath." He laughs and
begins singing: "There has been a lull in my life..."


Nineteen seventy was the year I got married and my sister left
home. Listening to him is like taking a journey through never-never
land. I feel as if I'm in a trance state, able to see this scene, him and
me alone in a hospital room in detail, but my feelings are locked in another
compartment. As his monologue continues, I tune out, thinking
about how ironic it is that Peter and I are having sexual problems
again, and here I am, standing only feet away from Dad's penis, which
I think has something to do with our problems, but I'm not sure
exactly what. I remember Dad prancing around the house nude on
many occasions during my childhood, and have talked to Mary Anne
about it, but I've never been able to come up with anything more.


As I tune back in to his rambling, I realize he's been recapping
every physical illness and accident in his life. "Well, Dad," I say, "it
sounds like you're scared about the surgery the doctor wants you to
have so he can resolve the pains you've been having."


He laughs. "That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Utter
nonsense. There's nothing to be afraid of. Who do you think you
are, putting a damper on my day like that, young lady?"


I'm jealous of the strength of his denial, and I feel sorry for my-self.
<i>My</i> fears--of going to the doctor, of shots and medication, and
more recently, of flying--are conscious. And they sometimes make
my life hell.


<i>Mary Anne, Mom, and Dad all recover from their</i>
surgeries, but only months later Mary Anne's cancer recurs. She undergoes
another mastectomy, but this time there's lymph node involvement,

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Around the same time I find a lump in my own breast and also
have to face a breast biopsy, which is scheduled for just before Christmas.
I'm sure the anesthesia will kill me. While shopping for presents
for the girls, I'm plagued with tragic fantasies of their trying to maneuver
adolescence without me. But despite my fears, I survive the
procedure and don't have cancer. Relief is short-lived; Peter's doctor
finds a growth in his lungs after a routine chest x-ray for a physical,
so we have another surgery to face. Again, no cancer is found, but his
recovery is long and difficult.


As he begins to get his strength back, we struggle to pry ourselves
out of the emotional debris accumulated over those terror-stricken
months. We are convinced the worst is over, but we're wrong. Our
sex life, still troubled by Peter's premature ejaculation problem, has
developed a malignancy of its own: Intercourse now launches me into
a pit of weeping despair each time we make love.


For the first few weeks of this crying, Peter is oblivious. After orgasm,
he rolls over into a deep sleep, snoring, and I cannot bear it. I retreat
to the bathroom and curl up on the floor, crying, then write in my
journal, and then crawl back into bed. The steps in our sexual dance
become even more anguishing after I tell him what's happening.


"Well, that's no big deal, Cath," he says. "It's just a tension-relieving
thing."


"No, Peter. This is different," I say. "I'm trying to tell you it's
<i>horrible."</i>


That night, he covers my mouth when I cry, and I just lie there,
struggling to breathe through my nose and swallowing my tears at the
same time, feeling as if he's trying to murder me. And I hate me. Every
bit of me. How can I even <i>think</i> that this basically kind--though passive,

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary Anne refers us to a sex therapist. "During orgasm, we have
emotional access to all our life experiences," he says when we see him.
"And I think it's significant that this symptom didn't start until your
therapist, your parents, you, and your husband had all been in the
hospital."


The sex therapist teaches Peter how to tune in more, to his own
feelings, and to mine. I listen as Peter describes how he never meant
to hurt me. He wanted to help me <i>not</i> cry, so I could enjoy myself. He
asks me to believe that he has only good intentions, but I can't. I knew
he was single-minded when I married him, and I liked that quality
at the time. I trusted the whatcha-see-is-whatcha-get aspect of him;
it was so unlike Dad. But we were only twenty-one then. Now, we're
thirty-eight, and I feel violated. Does he really think he has the right
to try to manipulate my feelings? Will he ever outgrow his commitment
to a simplistic "good guy" perception of himself?


The sex therapist feels that Peter's premature ejaculation problem
evolved gradually. As our household became busier, it was harder to
find time for sex, and as Peter's work life became more stressful, he
lost touch with his feelings. The therapist recommends books for us
to read and teaches us more about the nuances of male and female
sexuality, and our sex life revolves around the sex therapy exercises he
prescribes. Initially, Peter and I enjoy these interludes, and our sex life
feels as tender, passionate, and playful as it had been during the first
seven years of our marriage. But their frequency soon decreases, and
old problems resurface.


"Where have you <i>been?</i> It's five thirty in the morning!" I meet
Peter at the door, bombarding him with questions. "I was worried sick
about you. I called the police to see if there were any accidents involving
a blue Maxima wagon, and then I called three hospitals to see if
you'd been admitted to any of them!"

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Whatcha do that for, Cath? You knew I was at work." He stands
before me, his body hanging in his suit, collar unbuttoned, tie off,
pale, eyes bloodshot.


"How would I <i>know</i> you were at work?" I pace the family room
in my bare feet and nightgown, as relieved that he's home safe as I am
furious at his lack of consideration. "Did you call and tell me?"


"Yeah. Yeah, I did. I called you at seven o'clock. I distinctly remember,
because I was staring at the clock when Rose answered."


"And do you recall what you said?" My arms are on my hips now.


"Yeah. I said things weren't going well with that presentation I
had to prepare and I'd have to work late." He rests his briefcase on a
chair.


"No. You said you'd have to work a <i>little</i> late."


"I don't remember it verbatim, Cath." He takes his jacket off and
holds it in his lap as he sits on the couch. "But I remember what I
meant. I meant <i>late. "</i>


I close my eyes, sigh, pull my hair back, and then look him in the
eyes. "Do you have any idea how many nights the kids ask what time
you're coming home, or why you don't eat dinner with us, and all I
can say is <i>I don't know?"</i>


"I'm sorry, Cath." He leans forward. "I don't mean to hurt you or
the kids. Next time I'll call. I promise. But if you were so upset, why
didn't <i>you</i> call?"


"I did, many times. It just rang and rang. I figured you weren't
there, or some psychopath had gotten into the building and sliced
your throat with a knife!"


His face stills. "Shit, Cath. I was at the office the whole time, but
I was in the copier room making foils. <i>Damn</i>. There isn't a phone in
there."


I sense he's telling the truth, but I'm disgusted. I don't want to live
like this anymore, and I tell him I'm going to divorce him unless he
works on whatever it is that drives his workaholism, and then changes.
He agrees to join me for another round of marital therapy with Mary

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rollin is six feet five inches tall and wears the largest shoes I've
ever seen. He is slim except for a small paunch around his waist, with
gray hair, a beard, and glasses. Now a professor in the Religion Department
at Mercer, he counseled couples as an Army chaplain years
before. Mary Anne suggested that his inclusion would enhance the
therapy, but I wonder if he's equipped for a couple like us.


Peter talks about his childhood, and we begin to understand some
of the forces driving his behavior. His father was a stockbroker in New
York in the 1930s, and lost everything he had during the Depression.
I learn for the first time that Peter's mother had often told him his
father's whole attitude about life changed at that point, that she lost
the optimistic, ambitious man she had married.


Peter earned his appointment to the United States Military Academy
because he knew his parents couldn't afford to send him to college.
He wanted to ensure he wouldn't be a burden to them--they were in
their sixties by that time, and cadets received a salary. Now, with our
own children preparing for college, Peter wants to provide them the
opportunities for success his parents couldn't provide him. Working
with a passion has kept his fear of not being an adequate provider at
bay, while preserving the sense of personal competence he couldn't find
in our sex life. No wonder our discussions about women's and men's
changing roles had never penetrated his motivations. My attitude softens,
and I begin to hope we can strengthen our relationship.


<i>"Pat McCormick's coming this weekend," Peter tells</i>
Mary Anne and Rollin while we sit in her office one warm July evening.
"That's why she's crying. She doesn't want him to come. It's
ridiculous. He's a good friend. He ought to come."


Mary Anne's face flushes; she adjusts her bifocals and squints,
looking at me. "What's this about from your perspective, Cathy?"

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I... I hate him for the use of that word, 'ridiculous,'" I say. "I've
been fantasizing about Pat. I think I'm still in love with him--"


"She is not," Peter blurts. "This is nonsense."


"Peter, I think you had best sit tight and listen to what Cathy has
to say," Mary Anne retorts in a firm voice.


"I want to cancel Pat's visit, because I want to seduce him... and
I will, at the first opportunity. I just know it."


Mary Anne straightens in her seat, not taking her eyes off me.


"I'm scared," I continue, my voice cracking. I begin crying again,
but keep talking through my tears. "It feels dangerous, Mary Anne."


"Why do you call this ridiculous, Peter?" she asks, turning to look
at him. "Don't you feel threatened?"


Rollin leans back in his chair, tilting his head, watching Mary
Anne out of the corner of his eye. His presence is a comfort. I have
learned that he is kind, gentle-spirited, and insightful, different
from both my husband and my father. And I trust that he cares
about me.


"Do I feel threatened? Hell, no," Peter says. "First of all, Pat loves
Cathy as a friend. He's not interested in her as a romantic or sex partner.
I can just tell. And secondly, even if he were, Pat and Cathy both
have a lot of integrity. They just wouldn't do something like that. I'm
sure of it. I don't feel threatened one bit."


Mary Anne stands in front of Peter. <i>"What</i> is the <i>matter</i> With, you,
Peter?" she asks. "Why aren't you protecting your family?" She seems
to be losing her composure. I've never seen her react this way before.


"I appreciate your concern, Mary Anne, but I just got finished
telling you, Pat McCormick is no threat."


<i>Arrogant, narcissistic idiot,</i> I think. But I cannot say a word. My
throat hurts; head aches.


I take the driver's seat for the trip home, though I'm still crying.


"Are you sure you should be driving? You're so upset." Peter's
voice has a judgmental tone. <i>Far be it for him to get upset, Mister High
and Mighty</i>.


"Yes, I'm sure. I'm fine," I say. I need to take control of<i> something</i>.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I turn the radio on and drive toward Atlanta, regaining my composure.
My eyes are on the road while my mind wanders, reviewing
the session. I hear Peter snoring. <i>Fuck this. Why am I asking him to
support me in canceling Pat's visit? Why have I allowed myself to become
so dependent? I'm calling Pat myself, the minute I get home! I'm tired of
feeling fucked. No more!</i>


When we arrive home, I slam the car door and stomp inside.
Peter awakens and follows me.


"Why are you storming off like this?" he asks.


"None of your business!" I blurt, stomping through the kitchen.


"What's the matter with you?"


"You <i>dare</i> to ask me that question?" I turn to face him. "You fell
asleep and <i>snored</i> all the way home. What kind of husband are you?...
Are you going to protect your family from your wife having an affair?
Hell, no! Are you even going to really give a shit? Hell, no!... You're
gonna sleep through the whole thing. I could have an affair in our bed
and you wouldn't even notice. I can't believe I've just spent two hours
listening to you <i>snore!"</i>


"Cath, I'm sor--"


"I don't <i>care</i> if you're sorry. I've heard 'sorry' from you more times
than I want to remember. I'll protect <i>myself</i> from seducing Pat. I'm going
upstairs to call him right now. <i>I</i> feel too vulnerable, and <i>I'm</i> going
to cancel his visit!"


Peter walks in front of me. "Cath, don't, please." His eyes tear up.
"I'm disgusted with myself for letting you down again. Please, let me call.
I want to make it up to you. Let me take this burden away. It's a beautiful
night. Come out on the deck. Look at the moon. Listen to the crickets.
It'll be good for you." Tears roll down his face as he pleads with me.


"Okay," I reply, softening.


"Wait here for me, Cath." He holds the door to the deck open for
me, and then goes upstairs.


Minutes later, he returns and sits on the bench opposite me.
Crickets click their evening song while an awkward silence grows between
us. And then Peter speaks.

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I told Pat we were having some problems here in the family, and it
wasn't a good time to visit. I love you, Cath. Could we put all this aside
and go up to bed and make love? I want to begin to repair the damage.
I love you deeply, and I want to communicate it with my body."


"I love you too, Peter." I know it's true. "Let's go check on the
girls on our way upstairs."


The girls, now eighteen, seventeen, sixteen, and twelve, are watching
TV in the rec room in the basement. We visit with them for a little
while, and then send everyone off to bed. When the house is quiet, we
go in our bedroom, close the door, light candles, turn out the lights,
and take our clothes off. We hold each other's nakedness, lingering
in a tender embrace as we gently fall onto the sheets and make love.
Premature ejaculation problems become history. The thrusting of his
penis is hard and strong, penetrating deeper and deeper into the depth
of my being.


"Oh, Peter, this is wonderful. It feels so good. Oh, Peter, it feels
so new."


<i>No. No, it doesn't. Oh, no! It's just like the rape. What rape?</i>


<i>I'll show</i> you, <i>Catherine! I'll show</i> you! <i>And you'll keep your mouth</i>
shut!


<i>Oh, Daddy, no. Oh, no</i>. I see his face and his brown hair and his
shoulders. And he's mad... so mad.


<i>And</i> this <i>is for your mother!</i>--pound, pound.


<i>And</i> <i>this is for your grandmother!</i>--pound, pound.


<i>And</i> <i>this is for your older brother!</i>--pound, pound.


<i>And</i> <i>this is for that sister of yours!</i>--pound, pound.


<i>And</i> <i>this is for your baby brother!</i>--pound...


The child in my mind whimpers like a ten-year-old girl in the
terror of rape, yet my body is my forty-year-old self, feeling erotic
pleasure, sweating, and climaxing, ignoring the instant replay of horror
as if it were irrelevant. Suddenly, I realize where I am in my mind. I
notice the picture of the Sacred Heart behind Daddy. I'm in Mommy's
bed. Another part of me turns to look for Mary Anne, while a gentle
and loving voice inside me says, <i>It's all right to remember now, Catherine</i>.

Peter falls to my side, spent with pleasure, unaware that his cure
has placed him in the role of perpetrator to a ten-year-old, while I
stare at the candlelit ceiling, shocked into a stupor. Peter, legally blind
without his glasses, grabs them and rolls over to look at me with a grin
on his face, until his eyes adjust to what they're looking at and the
sparkle of joy in them clouds with worry. He strokes my cheek. "You
look like something's the matter. What's happening?"


I explain. He says nothing.


"It's true," I say. "I know it's true. But I can't believe it. I can't."
And then the dam breaks. I cry and he holds me.


"Gosh, Cath," he whispers. "I always wondered why you were in
such extreme pain the first time we made love... this must be why.
... But we got through it. We'll get through this, Cath... we'll get
through it." He strokes my head.


<i>I had studied about flashbacks, had worked with clients</i>
who'd accessed long-repressed memories through the trigger of a
sight or a sound or a feeling. I had been intrigued and respectful
of the psyche's power. But now, in the wake of my own flashback, I
am awed, and flooded with insights and questions. So <i>that's</i> why I
was so hysterical about Peter not supporting me in canceling Pat's
visit. My unconscious had been pleading, <i>Please don't let me have
sex with Father!</i> The memory of my father raping me was beginning
to emerge. And was it a coincidence that I was ten years old
in the memory, and that I've also been in therapy with Mary Anne
for ten years? On some deep level where the marriage of spirits
abides, could Peter have sensed what had happened to me all this
time, and could his sexual dysfunction have been a way of protecting
me from it?


What about Dad? Did his behavior occur in the mania of psychosis,
was he drunk, or did he just plain hate me and the rest of the

Answers to these questions have to wait. Mom calls the next
morning, asking for help. Dad has been admitted to the hospital with
severe pains in his prostate. Though the timing of his symptoms--
pain so near his genitals--seems to be in some psychosomatic way an
affirmation of what I remembered, his trip to the hospital ushers in a
series of medical and financial crises that make it clear that my parents
are no longer capable of living by themselves and managing the little
amount of money they have left. Life demands that we deal with the
present.
