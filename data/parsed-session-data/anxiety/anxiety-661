<i>Auburn provides us with the first loving church community</i>
we've had since we got married. St. Michael's Catholic Church is
attended by four hundred families, including many college students,
and is run by three Vincentian priests from New York and two sisters
of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, a rare breed
of down-to-earth social activists. Although in the middle of rural Alabama,
Auburn University attracts people from all over the country, so
there is a cosmopolitan flavor about town that reminds us of our old
neighborhood in Park Slope, Brooklyn.


Peter enjoys living closer to his computer sales customers and
working out of the house in the mornings, and 1 relish the freedom his
new schedule allows me. I resume my childhood habit of rising early
to attend daily Mass and often remain in the pew after Mass, savoring
moments of contemplation before returning home to the busy
routine.


Over time, these experiences, combined with the environment,
become a potent mix, stirring up awareness of conflicts between my
spiritual beliefs and my behavior toward my parents. I brood over

<i>My son, support your father in his old age, do not<br />
grieve him during his life. Even if his mind should<br />
fail, show him sympathy, do not despise him in your<br />
health and strength; for kindness to a father shall not<br />
be forgotten but will serve as reparation for your sins</i>.


And whenever I think about the fourth commandment--"Honor
your father and your mother"--I become more and more uncomfortable
with the fact that I cut myself off from mine. <i>What's wrong with
me,</i> I wonder, <i>that I can't comply with God's wishes--wishes so important
to God, they're couched in a promise? Why can't I be around my parents
without feeling I'll go crazy?</i>


"Yahweh acts only out of love, standing close to all who invoke
Him," Psalm 145 reads. If I believed that, would I need to continue
this cutoff? I feel weak and wounded, like a soldier returning from
war, damaged in spirit yet believing love is the only thing that makes
sense of life.


Psalm 139 becomes my favorite prayer. I recite part of it each
morning when I wake up, and again each night before bed:


<i>God, examine me and know my heart, probe me<br />
and know my thoughts; make sure I do not follow<br />
pernicious ways, and guide me in the way that is<br />
everlasting</i>.


I remain conflicted despite these efforts, however, and before long
anxiety creeps back into my body, like a bad case of the flu. I become
afraid to leave the house, yet staying home is a luxury the needs of my
family won't allow. I try to defy my fears, though errands as simple as
running to Winn-Dixie for milk and bread terrify me. My heart races
and I start to hyperventilate. I learn to cup my hands around my nose

<i>I make an appointment with a professor in the Marriage</i>
and Family Therapy program at Auburn University. Out of three
names recommended to me, I choose Mary Anne Armour. I like the
biblical and protective connotations of her name.


"Good morning, Cathy, and welcome." Her voice is strong yet
gentle, and I'm relieved by the sight of her. She is tall, wearing a pale
yellow pantsuit, and she has short, thick, healthy-looking gray hair.
With a warm smile, she shakes my hand, then leads me to her office, a
small windowless room. One wall is papered in metallic gold, covered
with branches, leaves, and birds. It reminds me of Ammy's dining
room wallpaper.


"My father has always hated shrinks," I say as I sit in the chair
opposite hers and notice her eyes are brown like Mom's, her ankles
swollen like Ammy's were.


Mary Anne smiles again and tilts her head. "I'm not a shrink," she
says. "I'm a marriage and family therapist."


I receive a hint of comfort from her words, but keep talking.
"I never understood why he valued everything about the medical
field except psychiatry. He hated it. Even preached to us that it was
dangerous."


"Is that why you're here? Would you like to find out more about
your father?"


"No... yes... I mean, I don't know. I have a splitting headache
all of a sudden. Like my brain doesn't want me to be here. But I've got
to be here," my voice quivers, "because I'm afraid of what will happen
if I keep everything bottled up. I'm afraid I might die of a brain tumor
or something.... I hope you can help me."

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary Anne reaches for the pencil and yellow legal pad on her
desk, then asks me what kinds of things are bottled up in my mind. I
explain how and why we moved to Auburn, and the guilt I'm feeling.
I tell her about Peter and the girls, and how important it is that I be
a good wife and mother. She asks me about what it was like growing
up in my family.


"I think I had a pretty happy childhood until I was about ten,"
I tell her.


"Ten?"


"Yes. My mother was drinking pretty heavily by then.... Things
went consistently downhill after that. But I haven't had to live with
my parents since I left for college. Why am I such a mess now, at
thirty-one?


"Perhaps your anxiety is inviting you into healing," she replies.


I stare at her. Calm enfolds me like a blanket.


"Your pain travels with you constantly, Cathy.... Perhaps it's
time for you to get in touch with it and integrate it."


I'm not sure what she means, but I like the reverence in her tone,
and her words offer hope. "Do you think you can help me, then?"
I ask.


"Yes, Cathy, I do. Of course, there are no guarantees about the
outcome, but I can promise I'll do everything in my professional ability
to help you." She reaches for her appointment book. "For now, I
recommend that you come weekly. In addition, I'd like to meet Peter
and the children, so let's schedule a family session soon."


Her suggestion frightens me a bit, but at the same time the
thought of all of us spending an hour with an experienced family
therapist feels like an opportunity. There is so much at stake. Claire
is now nine years old, approaching the age I was when Mother began
drinking heavily; Beth is eight; Annie is seven; and Rose, three. We
schedule the family session for two weeks later, and toward the end of
the session little Rose scoots off her chair, walks over to Mary Anne,
and sits on her lap. Mary Anne pats her back, and Rose turns to face
her, looks her in the eye, and says "I like you," then rests her head on

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary Anne excuses the children into the waiting room and then
explains to me and Peter why she feels the girls are each doing well.


I resume individual therapy.


"How long do you think I will need to see you?" I ask Mary Anne.


"I don't know, Cathy. My sense of it is that when the time comes,
we'll know."


Seeing a family therapist is a refreshingly different experience
from the sessions with the counselor in the psychiatrist's office in
Montgomery. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have found
someone who hears me accurately, and cares. Whether I talk about my
present life or my childhood, Mary Anne's comments, interpretations,
and questions reveal a depth of understanding about my family, then
and now.


After a year, I'm able to call my parents and tell them I want
to reestablish a relationship. Visits with them are sporadic, short,
and talked about for hours in therapy. Insurance doesn't cover Mary
Anne's fee, so I get a part-time job with Servpro, washing clothes and
linens from houses with smoke damage and hanging them outside
on the line to dry. I sell <i>World Book</i> encyclopedias door-to-door, and
begin to think about becoming a therapist myself. I had entertained
thoughts of becoming a midwife from the time Rose was born. But
now psychological processes are as awe-inspiring to me as childbirth.
Besides, in becoming a family therapist I might learn things that could
help Peter and me rear our own family. However, I can't imagine how
any of us could adjust to my working outside the home.


<i>It's the first day of school. Annie, Beth, and Claire have</i>
been delivered to second, third, and fourth grades and Rose, to her
first day of preschool. Peter and I have a date in bed. Making love
midmorning is a luxury we've been looking forward to. Afterward, he

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Goodbye, Cath." I hear his voice behind me and look up. He
stands at the bathroom door wearing his black wingtip shoes, navy
blue pin-striped suit, coordinating navy, gray, and burgundy striped
tie, and the white Brooks Brothers button-down oxford cloth shirt
that I've washed, starched, and ironed.


"What's so good about it?" I bark, feeling like I might throw up
from the stench of mixed Clorox and Lysol vapors. Perspiration drips
from my forehead and down the nape of my neck, below my Dorothy
Hamill haircut.


"What's the matter?" he asks. "We just made love.... I thought
you were looking forward to having the morning free."


I jerk my chin down toward the toilet. "Did I refer to this as free?
I must be crazy." I start crying.


"What's going on, Cath?! don't get it."


I stand up, grab the Windex and a paper towel, and begin cleaning
the mirror over the sink, paying no heed to the fact that tears are
blurring my eyesight too much for me to see the mirror, or that snot
is running down my face like molten lava.


"Help me here, Cath; why are you crying?... It's the first time in
years you've had a break.... What's the fuckin' problem?"


I put all the cleaning supplies on the floor, sit down, wipe tears
and snot from my face with wads of toilet paper, then blow my nose.


"I can't help it.... I don't see how I can go to school. Who will
do this?" I sob, and then regain my composure. "Everyone in this
family relies on me. And I feel guilty every time I try to do anything
for myself. I can't even remember the last time I bought a new item of
clothing. And I can't imagine us ever having enough income to buy a

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Peter's body stiffens. His face pales. "Oh, I see what you mean,"
he says. "It would be hard. But we can manage... at least try. You
can always drop out if it doesn't work. And you can count on me. I'll
do everything I can to support you." I feel his commitment is sincere,
though I fear he is ill-prepared to understand how much might need
to change.


<i>I'm accepted into the Marriage and Family Therapy</i>
program the following year, with a teaching assistantship to pay for
tuition. Graduate school gives me an appreciation for my intellectual
brother, Andrew, who is now a university professor. When we moved
from Montgomery, I had called Andrew and his wife and told them
what was going on. I wanted to make it clear that though I was breaking
ties with Mom and Dad, I still wanted contact with him, but I
never heard from him again.


Mary Anne suggests that I call and ask if he'd be open to our getting
together. But when I muster the courage to do so, he declines,
saying, "You seem to think that just because we shared something
in childhood, Cath, we should share something in adulthood. If you
need a kidney someday, give me a call, but otherwise, I've got a life I'm
pretty content with. Give my best to Peter and the girls."


I feel like I've been kicked in the gut. I knew he tended to be
distant--when we were growing up Andrew always seemed to find
a way to separate himself from the rest of us--but this response feels
particularly brutal.


My relationship with my younger brother, Paul, stands in sharp
contrast. While Peter and I were living in Montgomery, Paul came out
of the closet to the family about his homosexuality. It was a confusing
time for everyone, but we kept in touch by phone and in letters.
Peter and I included Paul in our visits to the McCalls, and Paul always
made the effort to participate in events that were important to me and

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The most surprising change in my family occurs when Lucy divorces
her husband and moves in with Mom and Dad. They are in a
sober and sane phase when they hear news of her divorce, and they
respond like loving parents, welcoming her into their home. But before
long, my parents start drinking again, and Dad becomes cruel to
her and her children--mocking and sneering at them, cursing and
swearing. She moves into an apartment, where she is harassed by the
Ku Klux Klan because of her children's dark brown skin. Finally, she
moves back to Brooklyn. Lucy lived in Montgomery for a year, though
she tells me it felt like a lifetime.


Meanwhile, I feel that Peter's behavior falls short of the support he
had promised. He likes the fact that I'm starting a career, but he seems
to want no part of the implications of what I'm studying. He continues
to focus on work, leaving me to manage the household almost
entirely. At the same time I am learning about the negative effects of
a father's absence on children, and the high rate of depression among
women with unavailable husbands. I beg him to share in household
chores and parenting. More importantly, I plead for more emotional
connectedness and understanding. But Peter seems disinterested in
giving any of this to me. He says he'll help out and then doesn't follow
through. He seems to be married to screens--either the TV or the
computer--and I feel ignored by him. How did this happen?


The classes I'm taking give me some insight into the childhood
roots of his behavior. Peter grew up in an alcoholic family whose lives
revolved around the TV in their living room. His mother would fix his

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387562-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Peter was seven, his mother got fed up with his dad's alcoholism,
sat him down, and told him she'd leave him and see to it that
he'd never see his children again if he didn't stop drinking. It worked;
he never drank again. I don't feel my marriage is to that point, but I
wonder what will happen to our relationship.
