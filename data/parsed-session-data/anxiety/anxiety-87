<b>Abstract</b>


<b>The article that follows is part
of the <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin's</i>
ongoing <i>First Person Accounts</i> series.
We hope that mental health
professionals—the <i>Bulletin's</i>
primary audience—will take this
opportunity to learn about the
issues and difficulties confronted
by consumers of mental health
care. In addition, we hope that
these accounts will give patients
and families a better sense of
not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be anticipated
by persons with serious
emotional difficulties. We welcome
other contributions from
patients, ex-patients, or family
members. Our major editorial requirement
is that such contributions
be clearly written and organized,
and that a novel or
unique aspect of schizophrenia
be described, with special emphasis
on points that will be important
for professionals. Clinicians
who see articulate patients,
with experiences they believe
should be shared, might encourage
these patients to submit
their articles to <i>First Person Accounts</i>,

Nearly every person I've talked
with who has a mental illness can
come up with a date that it began.
What they really meant was,
the date when it got so bad they
could no longer function. Around
July of 1987 I was doing a lot of
self-examination. I became obsessed
with the Bible, particularly
the book of Revelation. Up to that
point I had not really studied
much of the Bible. But it seemed
as though my life was coming to
an end, so what better book to
read than Revelation? At that time
I was working on an entirely new
reality, one with mysticism in it,
one with emotional gratification
beyond any reasonable comprehension.
In fact, I experienced it, but
I also experienced terror and hell.
This was all due to my illness.


It was during this time of reading
the Bible and fasting that I
had my first emotional trauma
coupled with a hallucination. At
the time I thought it was evil. I
thought people could transfer
themselves, their thoughts and
minds, from one body to the next,
but it was more complex than
that. In fact when this transfer occurred
you would actually "see"
the person from whom the transfer
had been taken. For example,
you imagine person A transferring
his or her mind to person B. Although
in "reality" person B is
the physical entity before you, person
A is the one you actually
"see." I could actually see both
(hence the hallucination). Deception
thus existed because of this mind
switch. In reality I was looking at
a co-worker and nothing more.


I think it was later in the week
when I began to have more serious
delusions. I was responsible
for loading copies of programs for
the online system programmers.
This authority was given to one
person to consolidate the process
and avoid costly errors. It was
usually quite stressful on Fridays
because the online transfer would
happen Thursday night. This

[p. <i>704</i>]

I dealt with the concept of killing
the people (via the dynamic
load process) by denying it was
actually happening and being totally
unaware of the killing. I was
imagining myself a pawn in a
giant game of deception against
humanity. I lived all this as if it
were reality. It was terrifying.
However, now I know this was all
due to my then undiagnosed mental
disorder.


Back then my delusions caused
tearfulness at times and consequently
my boss suggested I see a
psychiatrist. I did go and see one,
but I was too sick by then to be
able to realize all this was in my
imagination. I was certain the
therapist did not have my best interest
in mind and in fact considered
him a part of the corrupt
system of knowledge/judgment
that I referred to earlier. Trusting
your therapist is essential in getting
on the road to mental health.


These thoughts and others
caused my breakdown and finally
my decision to quit the company I
was working for. Unfortunately, I
lost my disability benefits when I
made that poor decision. I decided
to go back to school to get a
bachelor's degree. I struggled further
with my mental illness at
Wichita State University and could
not complete the first semester.
Finally my parents came from
Oklahoma and picked me up. I
went to a clinic and had my second
experience with the mental
health profession. The clinic first
gave me talk therapy from a psychologist.
Next I'd be ushered into
a room where the doctor prescribed
medication; my first was
Mellaril. Later, a "friend" of mine,
curious about my problems, called
and I told him I was taking the
Mellaril. He, being a pot smoker,
just laughed and thought I was
doing it for kicks. I have since
discontinued my friendship with
him. Disassociation with friends
that use drugs is highly advisable.


The problems I have are not
easily understood. They have
pretty much rendered me unemployable
for any length of time. In
some cases, I think my illness
aided me in dealing with abstract
programming applications. But I
would gladly give up the abstract
thoughts and creativity for emotional
receptiveness, stability, and
energy.


My brother said the other day,
"You are very creative." He went
on to say I should write a book
about my illness so people could
try to understand. In fact, it is
true that this illness enriches my
imagination, but it can be very
frightening and at times debilitating.
It seems my mental illness
will not just go away. It is a
chronic situation in which the
complications are mental and not
physical. With the body, when an
organ fails, sometimes complications
develop in another part of
the body. With the mind, it is a
thought or thoughts pervading the
conscious and/or subconscious that
build up, yielding false beliefs.


I would like to describe the few
delusions I've had in the past to
help others understand how frightening
and real these thoughts can
be. They are a thumbs up from
President Clinton on TV, a nip on
the thumb from a dog, a smile
from my mother while my nephew
had difficulty swallowing a
piece of potato. I now recognize
all these past delusions as false,
caused mainly by my condition
stabilizing with the medications I
take.


The sign from Clinton stems
from my uncertainty about
whether to vote for the Governor.
I was wavering between Clinton
and Perot. On the morning of the
vote, as I drove to the polls, I decided
to vote for Clinton. (Most of
the time I felt that I would vote
for him anyway.) When I went to
the polls, voting was not by machine
but rather by ballot. After
receiving instructions on how to
fill out the ballot I thought I
heard the registrar say to initial it
in the lower right-hand corner. I
wondered why I would have to
initial a ballot. It is supposed to
be a secret ballot. Immediately I
suspected that my vote and my
vote alone would determine the

[p. <i>705</i>]

The nip on the thumb was my
mother's thumb, not my own, but
it caused me mental pain just as
well. I was having a rather open
discussion about God with my sister
and Mom, and my mind had
been wandering. I had just told
my sister how God operates in my
life. I had been attending a support
group, which has helped
quite a bit. At times it seems as
though God works through the
people there. Anyway, I was beginning
to tell her this when my
sister's dog nipped my mom. Immediately,
I thought it was a sign
from God that my going to the
support group was wrong. It was
further reinforced by the blood
that was coming out of her finger,
analogous to Christ's crucifixion.
This was a delusion. I was distraught,
and it didn't end there.
My sister said innocently, "God
doesn't give signs that often." I
thought to myself, "True. I haven't
seen a sign in a long time, and
there it was—the dog bite—so I'd
better pay heed." Then I said,
"Maybe it was a sign from the
devil." My sister said, "He
wouldn't bother." What she meant
was that the devil would not
bother with such a trivial sign as
a little nip on the thumb, but
what I perceived was that the
devil wouldn't bother with me because
I was too sinful to worry
about. This only furthered the self-destructive
paranoid delusion.


The last delusion I mentioned
stemmed from when I was in
Wichita. There was a job service
called "Man Power," a name that
can take on additional connotations
if taken into an ill mind. The incident
with my nephew occurred
during a rather stress-filled day.
My sister and her husband's mom
and dad were here for a visit and
dinner. I occasionally suffer from
paranoia regarding food; for example,
it is evil to eat food and barbaric
to eat meat. My Mom had
fixed a large meal and everybody
had helped themselves to some of
the meat. My cute little nephew
Sam sat in his highchair next to
my mom, and my sister watched
as mom fed him a few potatoes.
He was having difficulty swallowing
the potatoes, and my sister
was concerned. She wasn't yelling
or anything, just a little nervous
about him being able to swallow
what he had in his little mouth.
Just then I looked up at my mom
and she smiled at me. I thought it
was an evil smile and that she
purposely fed him too much so he
would choke and die. She had
been changing his diapers all day
long, caring for him the way
grandmothers do, and I thought
she was doing harm to him. I was
certain of it then, but now I am
certain it was a delusion brought
about by my mental illness. My
paranoia sometimes tells me that
children are born to provide a
vessel for a future inhabitant who
is aging. This was reinforced by
the delusion I had about the
"Man Power" company. In my
mind I thought that a child is not
his own person, but rather a
"pawn" in this corrupt company.
The corruption in my mind extended
all the way up to the President
of the United States. My
nephew Sam was going to be a
vessel for me. It was terrifying! As
I write this I wonder whether this
thought will extend to God being
corrupt too! Writing this enables
me to detect this line of thinking
and understand it as fiction, a
wild imagination coupled with
mental illness.


Nevertheless, the story about my
nephew is very disturbing. I believed
it and even acted on it. I
got up out of my chair, walked
out, and hitched a ride to the Psychiatric
Crisis Center. I even accused
my mother of child abuse.
It was a few hours before I realized
that the whole thing was in
my mind. I called my brother in
Seattle and he talked me through
it. I came home to a worried family
and my snoozing nephew.


It probably isn't comforting
hearing these things but it is possible
to find relief. The key is to
be able to detect these false beliefs

If I could control the cause, I
would be able to help a lot of
people suffering from schizophrenia.
I'll leave that up to researchers
who are studying schizophrenia
and related disorders.


What I can do is give information
about the current mental state
of a person diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I can also give some tips
on how to help yourself if you
suffer from schizophrenia.


While not an extremely common
aspect of mental disorders, it is a
problem nonetheless. Judgment
and decision making are greatly
affected by your emotions. If you
lack emotion people might consider
you cruel or insensitive.
Cruel is definitely not the case. In
the most literal sense, insensitive
basically hits the nail on the
head—insensitive in the sense that
the emotional sense is defective.
This is not by choice, however.
The minds of individuals with
schizophrenia simply do not respond
to feelings on the level that
a normal mind does. I cannot
imagine quite what it would be
like to have good emotions the
majority of the time. I do know
what it is like to have a low
mood or a high mood. However,
emotions have a great influence on
the normal person's life and ultimately
what they do from day to
day. As a psychiatrist aptly put it,
"It is difficult to feel."


Here is a dilemma. I do not
know if it is possible to build up
emotional sensitivity with my mental
illness. I know that the medications
can have a rather large impact
on how one feels. So it is
important, perhaps, to continue
with research on better drugs for
mental disorders. Flat emotions are
an apparent trade-off for reduced
psychotic symptoms. It has been
my experience that flat emotions
make one feel emotions to a lesser
degree than a normal person.


In the meantime, is there anything
you can do to help yourself?
One main method is to reach out
to others for support. Sometimes
this is very difficult for people to
do. Maybe they don't feel comfortable
socially with the situation.
Sometimes, it is not possible to
meet with people and discuss
problems for fear of being
shunned.


The solution to the abovementioned
problems is trained
mental health professionals. They
can help if you will let them.


"Bad" or troubling thoughts
contribute to a person's state of
mind. The majority of the time the
thoughts evoke shame, guilt, and
anxiety. It is curious that we have
these thoughts at all. My mother
once told me, "Thoughts are free."
It is true. They don't cost you a
thing, so they shouldn't affect you
in a negative way when they are
troubling or bad. I've learned that
the source of these thoughts is unimportant.
Everybody has them
from time to time. What you can
do is treat them as a learning experience
and learn to identify an
aspect of your personality that
perhaps the thoughts can be made
analogous to. Then draw a positive
picture from those thoughts.
You may ask, how can you draw
a positive picture from a negative
thought? Well, you have to learn
to accept that you are not perfect
and those imperfections make up
part of you anyhow. In many
cases, those negative thoughts
don't manifest themselves in your
personality to any real degree, so
why give them any more credence
than a mere passing thought.
These thoughts are a mechanism
by which you can learn to grow
by accepting your shortcomings.


I can't emphasize enough how
destructive negative thoughts can
be. It is no more comforting
either, for somebody simply to say
"Don't think that way," because
after all, "thoughts are free."
Without thoughts, what would we
be? With all "good" thoughts,
would our life not be rather mundane?
I'm not advocating seeking
out bad thoughts to enrich one's
life. On the contrary, what I see is
that these discomforting thoughts
are instead a bit of anger surfacing,
anger about not being willing
to accept one's own faults or constructive
criticism. Sometimes criticism
is not constructive, and the
same is true of some thoughts.
Hence, some "bad" thoughts are
present. The trick is to let these
negative thoughts enrich your life,
rather than destroy or control your
life. It is possible to grow from
negative thoughts.


The best part of all about life is
that there are good thoughts to reflect
on and to experience. On that
note, I would like to say some
positive things. The mentally ill,
despite having to deal with stigma
issues, have it better than they
ever have. There are psychiatrists
and trained counselors to help us.
There are medications that lessen
suffering. There are social programs
to help the mentally ill. The
public is slowly being educated.
We need to keep all this going
strong! I am very lucky because
my parents and family are very
supportive of me. Also, I have a
