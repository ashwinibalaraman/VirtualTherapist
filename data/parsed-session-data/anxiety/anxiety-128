<font size="4"><b>7: Biology and Behaviour: The Educational Relevance of a 

Biopsychosocial Perspective</b></font>

PAUL COOPER


Over recent years biology has come to play an increasing role in our
understanding of human thought and behavioural processes. Educational
discourses are beginning to acknowledge the relevance of biology in new
ways (Geake and Cooper, 2003). This is particularly evident in the field
of social emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD). There are difficult
and, at times, controversial aspects to this topic. However, whilst we
must address these challenges with care and caution, we must also avoid
simplistic responses. A key assumption underpinning this chapter is that
the more we understand about the nature of a child's difficulties the
better placed we are to provide effective support. Crucially, we must find
ways of incorporating biological insights with social and environmental
understandings of SEBD. A biopsychosocial perspective, it is argued, will
help us to do this. The chapter opens with examples of different types of
SEBD, followed by brief accounts of the social psychological and behavioural
explanations of how these difficulties develop. The chapter concludes
with some examples of how these understandings can translate into
approaches to intervention. Careful attention is given to the nature of and
basis for biological claims and their value to educators in promoting the
positive educational engagement of students' schools.

<b>THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL
AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES</b>


<b>The prevalence of SEBD</b>


It is estimated that at least 10 per cent of the school population in England
is, at any one time, affected with SEBD. These students are distributed
across the range of educational provision, though it is important to note
that the overwhelming majority is to be found in mainstream schools (see
Table 7.1).


<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000013190-I0006&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Having said this, in spite of the overall increase in numbers of students
with a wide range of special education needs (SEN) being educated in
inclusive settings, the numbers of students with SEBD being educated in
segregated settings in England has remained virtually static over the past
30 years (Norwich, 2003). This suggests that whilst SEBD is largely a
pervasive problem faced by the majority of mainstream schools, there
remains a significant problem in securing the access of members of this
group to mainstream education.


<b>Categories: caution and value</b>


Although categorical approaches to SEBD (and other areas of SEN) are
unpopular with some educationists, they can help us to appreciate the
range of difficulties that fall under the vague umbrella term of SEBD.
Categories should, however, be treated with caution. We should be wary
about the negative consequences of indiscriminate labelling. It is helpful
to think of these categories as applying to social, emotional and behavioural
patterns that, rather than as labels to be applied to people. It is also
helpful to see the patterns of behaviour defined by these categories as
extreme variants of normal behaviour. As such, so-called deviant or disordered
behaviour not only describes behaviour, but behaviour in relation
to a particular situation. The situation will usually include the viewpoint
of an individual (or shared by a group) that judges the behaviour to be
deviant or disordered.

[p. <i>107</i>]

There is a further reason why a categorical approach to understanding
SEBD might be useful. Studies suggest that teachers' pedagogical decision-making
is strongly influenced by teachers' perceptions of pupils that are
based on fairly limited interaction with and observation of pupils (Brown and
McIntyre, 1993). A study of teachers in English secondary schools found
that, after only seven weeks of year seven, teachers came to apparently
stable decisions about the characteristics of their pupils in terms of pupils'
levels of ability, whilst strong speculations were being made about pupils'
behaviour, motivation and personal attributes (Cooper and McIntyre, 1996:
133). These decisions can be understood in terms of Hargreaves et al's
(1975) theory of typing, by which the teacher places pupils into ready-made
categories relating to pupils' perceived ability, behaviour and motivation,
and other personal attributes (for example, appearance, gender and so
on) (Cooper and McIntyre, 1996). These studies suggest that this typing
process is an important element in expert teachers' professional craft knowledge,
enabling them to make speedy sense of complex circumstances and
conditions in busy classroom settings in which there is limited time for
extended reflection and analysis. If this is a general feature of the way in
which teachers operate, then it would seem important that teachers employ
sound theoretical knowledge. It is also important to note that whilst teachers
can use research-based theoretical insights to inform their practice, it seems
that this process is most effective when the theoretical knowledge can be
assimilated through direct reference to their practical theorizing.


<b>An outline typology of SEBD</b>


Psychiatrists and psychologists commonly divide SEBDs into two main
categories: <i>externalizing</i> difficulties and <i>internalizing</i> difficulties. It is 

also
possible to think of these categories in terms of their <i>aetiology</i>, that is, the
range of factors which influence the development of the difficulties. These
aetiological factors can be thought of in terms of biological, psychological,
social and cultural influences.


<b>Externalizing difficulties I</b>


These are patterns of behaviour and manners of self-presentation that are
experienced by others as being disruptive, antisocial and/or confrontational.


Sub-categories of externalizing will include:


<i>Disaffection</i>: attitudes and behaviours that indicate discontent and an
antipathy towards the formal values of the school and a consistent pattern
of behaviour and discourse that challenge these values (for example,
Cooper, 1993);

[p. <i>108</i>]

<i>Conduct disorder</i>: aggression towards others, destruction of property;
deceitfulness or theft; serious violation of rules (APA, 1994);


<i>Delinquency</i>: as above, involving law-breaking;


<i>Oppositional defiance</i>: a pattern of negativistic, hostile and defiant
behaviour (APA, 1994), including frequent loss of temper, arguing
with adults, active defiance or refusal to comply with adult rules and
requests, annoying others apparently deliberately; often blaming of
others; touchy and easily annoyed by others; often angry and resentful;
often spiteful and vindictive; this may include tantrum behaviour.


<b>Some social and psychological influences on
the development of externalizing SEBDs</b>


Much of the research on these problems has focused on the search for
<i>environmental</i> causes. For example, research by Patterson et al. (1992) on
severely antisocial adult males found a particular pattern of social influences
recurring in the life histories of these men. The men commonly
came from families afflicted by social difficulties in the form of unstable
and conflictual family circumstances, where patterns of care were unpredictable
and discipline was enforced inconsistently, with corporal punishment
being a recurrent feature in child management. Patterson et al.'s
model has four main stages. The pre-school basic training phase during
which children's coercive behaviour (for example, tantrums, crying, hitting,
yelling) is unwittingly reinforced by carers, whilst more pro-social
ways of expressing needs are not adequately reinforced. In the second
phase, the child reaches school age, where his coercive behaviours receive
a negative reaction from teachers and peers. As a result the child becomes
increasingly marginalized. This paves the way to the third phase, which
usually occurs in the junior/secondary years, in which the rejected child
seeks out other similarly marginalized children with whom he forms an
unholy alliance. They form a deviant subculture and reward each others'
antisocial behaviour. The fourth stage is that of the career antisocial
adult. This stage is characterized by a replication of the social circumstances
that gave rise to the initial difficulties. Individuals in this stage
have difficulty forming relationships, obtaining and keeping employment.
They drift into criminal behaviour and are at high risk of engaging in substance
abuse and developing mental health problems.


This first set of externalizing problems can be seen largely in terms of
<i>learned</i> patterns of behaviour. Negative, coercive behaviour becomes
the only tool that the individual has for getting needs met and alternative,
more positive and pro-social patterns of behaviour are either taught
ineffectively or simply not made available to the individual.

[p. <i>109</i>]

Another causative factor, sometimes associated with the social learning
theory cited above, is concerned with the effect of attachment problems
on social development (Bowlby, 1975). This theory suggests that some
individuals experience unsatisfactory relationships with their primary
carers in early infancy, and this deficiency can lead to feelings of insecurity
and alienation, which in turn may manifest themselves in the form
of internalized (see below) or externalized social, emotional and behavioural
difficulties. This approach emphasizes the way in which SEBDs
can sometimes be underpinned by deep, emotional problems. Where this
is the case, the learning of pro-social behaviours is severely hampered
by underlying emotional problems (for example, Bennathan and Boxall,
2000).


A further important psychological theory offering a powerful explanation
for some SEBDs is attribution theory (for example, Weiner et al.,
1971). This theory combines social learning and cognitive elements. It
focuses on the explanations people give for their behaviour and places
particular emphasis on the ways in which explanations either indicate
individuals' belief that they are in control of their behaviour, or their
belief that they are helpless in the face of external influences which cause
their behaviour. The preference for external attributions is associated with
the concept of learned helplessness, which is often the product of experiences
in which individuals have been unsuccessful in controlling
negative influences in their lives (Davison and Neale, 2001). This fatalism
may render the individual passive in the face of antisocial or delinquent
influences.


<b>Externalizing difficulties 2</b>


A second set of externalizing problems include:


<i>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder</i> (APA, 1994): chronic, pervasive
and debilitating problems in controlling attention and/or impulsivity
and motor activity (hyperactivity) (see also <i>Hyperkinetic
Disorder</i>, WHO, 1990).


<i>Autistic spectrum disorders</i>: (including autism, Asperger's syndrome,
Tourette's syndrome) debilitating impairments in the quality of the
child's social interactions when compared to others of same developmental
stage (for example, fails to make effective social relationships,
shows lack of understanding of feelings of others; does not seek to
share others' company spontaneously); communication problems;
restricted and repetitive, and stereotypical behaviours. (This condition
often has internalizing aspects as well.)

[p. <i>110</i>]

<b>Some biological influences on the development
of externalizing SEBDs</b>


These problems, which are often referred to as developmental disorders,
are characterized by the presence of biological factors in their causation,
as well as evidence that for the most part there are genetic factors
involved in the transmission of the disorders (Comings, 1990). In particular,
neuro-psychological researchers have identified abnormalities in
the brains of individuals with these conditions. In all three of these conditions
the frontal lobes of the brains of affected individuals have been
found to function differently from those of the general population. The
frontal lobes are the part of the brain concerned with the regulation of
attention and behaviour. In individuals with AD/HD, some studies have
found marked under-activity in this area of the brain (Tannock, 1998),
leading to difficulties sustaining and directing attention and inhibiting
behavioural responses. There are a number of theories as to the precise
nature of the cognitive mechanisms involved in AD/HD. One widely-accepted
view is that the neurological problems associated with AD/HD
lead to cognitive impairments in the area of executive functions (Barkley,
1997). Executive functions include: short-term memory, internal dialogue,
the appraisal of motivation and behavioural synthesis (that is, the
recall of the consequences of behaving in a particular way). Executive
functions come into play when we experience an impulse to behave in a
particular way (for example, to call out, make a joke, or touch the surface
of a painting in an art gallery). The impulse is filtered through the
executive function system, and on the basis of this a decision is made
whether or not to carry through the behavioural impulse. Where the executive
function system is impaired, the filtering process does not take
place, or is hampered in some way, leading us to act on the impulse in an
automatic way.


In autism and Asperger's syndrome (sometimes referred to as high
functioning autism), cognitive impairments affect individuals' ability to
attend to and monitor social elements in the environment. This gives rise
to the theory of mind hypothesis, which posits that the major difficulty
experienced by individuals with these disorders is an impaired ability to
interpret other people's thought states on the basis of their behaviour.
These problems have been associated with dysfunctions of the frontal
lobes, temporal lobes and the limbic system of the brain in individuals
with these disorders (Klin et al., 2000).


In Tourette's syndrome, a dominant cognitive theory suggests that there
is an impairment in the intention editor. The intention editor is part of the
executive function system (see above) and is responsible for controlling

[p. <i>111</i>]

In each of these cases, the neurological impairments are sometimes associated
with abnormalities in the physical structures themselves, as a result of
abnormal development or brain injury, and sometimes with the neurochemical
factors. In the latter cases the physical structures of the brain may be perfectly
normal, but the chemicals responsible for stimulating activity in these
regions (neurotransmitters) may be functioning in an inappropriate way, or
present in insufficient quantities (Comings, 1990).


It is important to stress that the presence of biological factors should not
be taken as an indication of a simple biological <i>cause</i> for the associated
difficulty or disorder. Biology always interacts with the environment, so
that even when there is a biological element present, the ways in which
this biological element affects behaviour is often mediated by experience
of the environment. This point is expanded upon below.


<b>Internalizing difficulties 1</b>


This is the second sub-division of SEBD. These are difficulties of an emotional
and/or behavioural nature that are not so much disruptive as disturbing
to others. As with the first sub-division, however, these are problems that may
well lead to serious under-performance in school, as well as impairment in
social relationships.


Sub-categories of the internalizing sub-division of SEBD include:


<i>Truancy and school refusal</i>: persistent and frequent failure to attend
school for reasons unknown considered illegitimate by the school/in
law.


<i>Separation anxiety</i> (APA, 1994): developmentally inappropriate and
excessive anxiety concerning separation from home or from those to
whom the individual is attached (1994: 75) as evidenced by, for
example, excessive levels of stress, fear and/or worrying in relation to
separation events.


<i>Withdrawn behaviour</i>: excessive avoidance of contact with others to an
extent that interferes with educational participation and progress as well as
social functioning.


<i>Elective/selective mutism</i> (APA, 1994): consistent and persistent failure
to speak in specific social situations where speaking is expected to
a degree that interferes with educational participation and progress.

[p. <i>112</i>]

<b>Some social and psychological influences on the
development of internalizing SEBDs</b>


These problems, like the first set of externalizing problems, are generally
seen as being primarily the product of environmental factors, similar in
many ways to those associated with the first set of externalizing problems.
Attachment theory, attribution theory and social learning theories apply to
these conditions in much the same way as they do to externalizing problems.
They are learned behaviours that have been programmed and reinforced
by unfavourable social circumstances (Blau and Gullotta, 1996).
Having said this, there is a body of evidence that relates extreme fear, shyness
and social phobia in children to various biological mechanisms
(Schmidt and Schulkin, 1999). It is noted, for example, that some children
are, from birth, more reactive to environmental stressors than others, producing
extreme fear and withdrawal responses in situations that other
children find only mildly uncomfortable. Stansbury (1999) relates these
physiological differences to differences in children's attachment behaviour.


<b>Internalizing difficulties 2</b>


A second set of internalizing problems includes:


<i>Substance misuse and abuse</i>: problems of educational participation
and progress which are related to the misuse through ingestion of alcohol,
drugs or other substances.


<i>Anxiety disorders</i> (APA, 1994): problems with panic attacks and agoraphobia
(for example, fear of crowds) leading to problems of educational
participation and progress; this can include various phobias,
post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder.


<i>Depression</i> (APA, 1994): suffering the majority of the following symptoms
to an extent that seriously interferes with school performance and
social functioning: depressed or irritable mood (self-reported or observed)
most days; marked diminished interest or pleasures in all or most activities
most days; significant weight loss when not dieting; insomnia or
hypersomnia nearly everyday; observable psycho-motor agitation almost
everyday; fatigue; delusional guilt; diminished ability to think and concentrate;
preoccupation with death, suicide; suicidal behaviour.


Some biological influences on the development
of internalizing SEBDs


Clearly, problems such as these are commonly associated with negative
social circumstances (Davison and Neale, 2001). People sometimes turn

[p. <i>113</i>]

<b>BIOLOGICALLY-BASED NEEDS:
THE INTERTWINING OF EMOTION
AND BEHAVIOUR</b>


The importance of biologically-based drives in human development is
well established. The psychologist Abraham Maslow (1970) theorized
that all human beings are motivated by a set of biologically programmed
needs. He presents these needs in the form of a hierarchy, arguing that
lower level needs must be met before needs further up the hierarchy can
be addressed (see Table 7.2).


<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000013190-I0007&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The lower level needs of Maslow's hierarchy (physiological and
safety) are concerned with individual survival. It is only once these needs
are secured that the individual can begin to address the social world and
show concern for interacting with others (affiliation). Once affiliation is
established, then individuals become concerned with the quality of how
they are perceived by others and make an effort to enhance their image
by behaving in ways that encourage social approval (self-esteem). Only
once healthy self-esteem is established can individuals become truly self-directing
and operate as autonomous, responsible individuals in a pro-social
but independent way. The implication of this theoretical
framework for our understanding of SEBD is that if a particular category
of need is left unmet, then the needs above it in the hierarchy are an irrelevance.
For example, the student who is pervasively insecure and fearful

[p. <i>114</i>]

Maslow's hierarchy resonates with Pringle's (1975) typology of
children's needs. The important thing about Pringle's theory is that it is
based on systematic analysis of data from the massive National Child
Birth Study, which charted the lives of a very large cohort of people from
birth through their childhood, teens and beyond. Pringle's theory relates
to the school years. She concludes that healthy psychological development
(that is, emotional wellbeing, appropriate social engagement, and
educational progress) are associated with four categories of need:


 the need for love and security;


 the need for praise and recognition;


 the need for new experiences; and


 the need to exercise responsibility.


Pringle's framework of needs bears many similarities to Maslow's,
emphasizing the fundamental importance of security needs and the way in
which social and cognitive competence are intertwined with basic emotional
drives.


Glasser's (1993) control theory takes our understanding of human
needs a step further, citing the following set of biologically-based needs:


 to play and have fun;


 to be free to make choices;


 to exercise power and influence;


 to belong to a social group and love others; and


 to survive.


These needs are best understood as a set of overlapping drives which
should be held in balance. As the term control theory suggests, a central
feature of Glasser's needs framework is the idea that human beings are
driven by a central need to exert control over their lives. Where there is an
imbalance, problems occur. For example, the individual who does not
achieve a sense of belonging to the social group may seek antisocial means
of exerting power and influence over others, since the pro-social avenues
which come with a sense of belonging are blocked.


An implication of Maslow's and Glasser's theoretical frameworks is
that the kind of positive student engagement that schools seek to promote
will only happen when schools and teachers understand and cater for these
deeply embedded motivational drives. If we look back to Patterson et al.'s

[p. <i>115</i>]

A common element of all three of these needs frameworks is the human
paradox that the capacity for free and autonomous action is closely linked
with the extent to which insecurity and dependency are effectively handled.
This is also a central feature of attachment theory (see above).
According to this view, SEBDs can often be located in relation to unmet
security needs. The dysfunctional and challenging behaviour that is often
associated with SEBDs, therefore, can be seen as a largely involuntary
expression of deep-seated, unmet emotional needs. It follows from this
theoretical approach that it is only when these basic needs are met that the
individual finds himself or herself in the position to make more socially
acceptable behavioural choices (so long as such positive options are available,
of course).


<b>INTERACTIONAL MODELS: BIOLOGY
AND THE ENVIRONMENT</b>


It has been shown how SEBD can be produced both environmentally and
ways in which biological factors of two main kinds can sometimes influence
the development of SEBD. The first set of biological factors is concerned
with pathology or individual differences, often of a neurological and
genetic nature. The second set of biological influences relate to common
human needs, or drives. In this section consideration is given to how these
various factors may interact.


The term biopsychosocial is used to describe the way in which biological,
psychological and socio-cultural factors interact with and influence
one another (Norwich, 1990). In relation to social deviance and abnormal
psychology, the diathes-stress paradigm (Davison and Neale, 2001)
describes the way in which individual, biologically-based constitutional
(diathes) factors are affected by environmental stressors to produce social,
emotional and behavioural difficulties. From this perspective, biological
differences, which in some cases may be genetically based, take the form
of risk factors which, when combined with a particular set of environmental
conditions, lead to certain patterns of dysfunctional behaviour. In the
absence of the necessary environmental conditions, the dysfunctional
behaviour does not appear, or at least not to an extent that is severely disruptive
to the individual or the social world inhabited by the individual.
This paradigm has been used to explain a wide range of SEBDs, including
anxiety, depression, conduct disorder and eating disorders.

[p. <i>116</i>]

<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000013190-I0008&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Uta Frith (1992) has devised a model to show how developmental disorders
(such as autism, Asperger's syndrome and AD/HD) can be understood
in terms of the interaction between biological and other factors (see
Figure 7.1). The extent to which brain-based differences lead to particular
forms of behaviour is influenced by the individual's experience, level of
motivation, maturation and their possession of compensatory skills and/or
circumstances. Clearly, motivation to overcome difficulties will be influenced
by the individual's sense of confidence, which in turn may well be
influenced by their sense of security (see above). Skills, on the other hand,
have to be learned. The point is that even biologically-based conditions,
such as AD/HD, are not solely determined biological factors; they are the
product of a combination of biological, psychological and social factors.


<b>INTERVENTION ISSUES</b>


Clearly, whether or not biological factors are implicated in a particular set
of SEBDs, the role of educators is to respond to these difficulties with
educational approaches. Educational approaches are always concerned
with manipulating the environment in order to facilitate appropriate educational
engagement by students and pupils. This begs the question: so
what is the value of biological insights to teachers? There is a straightforward
answer to this question. The role of biological understandings is to
deepen the teacher's understandings of:

[p. <i>117</i>]

 why students behave as they do and the nature of specific difficulties;


 why different students sometimes respond differently to the same or
similar situations and interventions;


 how to evaluate the appropriateness of different intervention
approaches; and


 the importance, in some cases, of seeing educational intervention in the
context of a co-ordinated multi-disciplinary intervention programme.


As we have seen, biological understandings emphasize the importance of
social and emotional factors as crucial influences on SEBDs by showing the
complex way in which these interact with biological factors. They help
us to understand how the human biological subsystem interacts with the
environmental/ecological system. This view challenges simplistic and
inaccurate nature-versus-nurture arguments.


<b>Systemic approaches</b>


One way of converting this insight into an intervention approach is provided
by the SALAD framework to dealing with SEBDs in schools (Cooper et al.,
1994; Olsen and Cooper, 2001). This approach emphasizes the way in
which SEBDs are embedded in complex, interacting individual and social
factors, and attempts to shape this understanding into a school-based
approach. The SALAD acronym stands for:


<i>Systems</i>: the need for intervention and policy to be rooted in an analytical
understanding of the way in which individual psychological
and biological factors interact with social circumstances, and how the
views and understandings of different stakeholders in relevant social
subsystems need to be taken account of in the development and implementation
policy and intervention. The effectiveness of the rest of the
SALAD approach depends upon the quality of the systemic analysis
on which it is based.


<i>Access</i>: the need for students who are the target for intervention (and
other stakeholders) to have unimpeded access to knowledge about the
interventions being used and their purpose. A central feature of access
is <i>ownership</i>, whereby students become partners with other stakeholders
in working towards making the intervention work on the basis of
their understanding that the intervention serves their mutual interests.


<i>Limits</i>: clear behavioural boundaries have to be in place. Appropriate
behaviour should be defined and reinforced, whilst inappropriate
behaviour should be identified and discouraged.


<i>Acceptance</i>: interactions between stakeholders should be characterized
by unconditional acceptance of persons as individuals. Condemnation

[p. <i>118</i>]

<i>Direction</i>: support and guidance should be given to students to enable
them to make progress through the intervention programme.


The SALAD approach attempts to combine clarity and comprehensiveness
of approach with flexibility and the need to cater for individual
differences. It can be seen as a school-based version of Henngeler's
(1999) multisystemic therapy (MST), which is a community-based
intervention programme for young people with SEBD, and in particular
conduct disorder. The approach employs systemic analysis of
problem behaviour (that is an analysis which looks at SEBDs in reaction
to their social context), as well as individual analysis (that is, an
exploration of within person factors of psychological or biological
nature). MST has been found to be one of the most effective forms of
intervention for conduct disordered adolescent males in the United
States (Kazdin, 1998). It is characterized by its multi-disciplinary
focus, its comprehensiveness and its sensitivity to the full range of possible
intervention strategies that may range from parent training to individual
drug therapy, or include a combination systemic, behavioural,
cognitive and medical therapies.


<b>Behavioural approaches in context</b>


When intervention is informed by the holistic biopsychosocial perspective
presented in this chapter, the emphasis is placed on fitting the intervention
to the specific circumstances of the SEBDs that we are targeting.
Sometimes, it is found that simple behavioural interventions, such as positive
or negative reinforcement, are all that is required. Such interventions
include the use of points systems and time-out. As we have noted, however,
behaviour should not be seen in isolation from emotions. This means
that the emotional climate in which a behavioural programme is introduced
should always be seen as an important part of any behavioural
intervention. For example, a climate of positive regard in which students
are valued as individuals will enhance the effectiveness of behavioural
interventions, whilst a climate of blame and negative labelling will under-mine
the behavioural intervention.


<b>The importance of cognitive styles and learning styles</b>


One of the practical outcomes of neuropsychological research has been
the light it has shed upon the biological correlates of cognitive style.

[p. <i>119</i>]

From an educational point of view, disorders, such as AD/HD and
Asperger's syndrome, can be usefully seen as unusual cognitive style
variants rather than in terms of cognitive deficit. When teachers take this
perspective they question generalized assumptions about how pupils learn
and acknowledge that different students might require quite different
circumstances in order to learn the same content. Kolb (1984) identifies
four main learning styles, each of which can be seen in terms of a set of
preferences:


<i>A preference for CONCRETE EXPERIENCE</i>
Emphasizes: feeling over thinking; here-and-now complexity over
theories and generalizations; intuitive over systematic.


<i>A preference for REFLECTIVE OBSERVATION</i>
Emphasizes: understanding over practical application; the ideal over
the pragmatic; reflection over action.


<i>A preference for ABSTRACT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS</i>
Emphasizes: thinking over feeling; theories over here-and-now complexity;
systematic over intuitive.


<i>A preference for ACTIVE EXPERIMENTATION</i>
Emphasizes pragmatic over ideal; doing rather than observing.
(Based on Kolb, 1984: 68-9)


Pupils with AD/HD tend to favour the concrete experience and active
learning styles. These learning styles are most useful in circumstances where
tasks are experiential in nature: where the learning emerges from doing.
Individuals with Asperger's syndrome, which is characterized by severe difficulties
in reading social cues, often experience difficulty with metaphorical
representations and are most comfortable with concrete, clear and logical
representations of knowledge. The child with AD/HD is more likely than the
child with Asperger's syndrome to thrive in a learning environment which
values divergent and novel patterns of thinking.


An awareness of the implications of differences in cognitive and
learning styles helps the teacher to plan learning experiences which play
to the pupils' strengths. It also helps the teacher positively to reframe a
pupil's apparent lack of interest or reluctance to engage in certain learning
tasks.

<b>CONCLUSION: BIOLOGY HELPS US TO
UNDERSTAND  IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE</b>


It is important to know when an individual's behaviour is accurately
accounted for through reference to factors outside the immediate individual's
conscious control. To hold people responsible for actions outside
their control is wrong. This is not to say that biologically or socially
induced behaviours cannot be brought under the control of the individual.
An understanding of the ways in which biological, psychological and
social factors sometimes interact to undermine an individual's power of
self-control can open up opportunities from which positive, corrective and
empowering interventions can be created. On the other hand, it is sometimes
difficult for teachers to remain motivated and keen to support pupils
whose difficulties are attributed to the pupil's own lack of enthusiasm for
learning <i>per se</i>. In fact, such negative attitudes are likely to disempower
individuals who are seeking to change the behaviour of others (Cooper and
Ideus, 1996). After all, you can take a horse to water, but you can't make
it drink... Furthermore, an acknowledgement of the complex interplay of
different factors involved in shaping behaviour can lift the burden from the
individual professional by leading them to the realization that they will
benefit from sharing their expertise with that of other professionals.


A biopsychosocial perspective can help overcome the impulse to blame
and condemn, but it must never be allowed to encourage anyone to escape
from the responsibility to put effort into overcoming SEBD. A biopsychosocial
understanding will not be useful if it is allowed to be employed as a means
of excusing or ignoring SEBD. Almost any explanatory theory for SEBD can
be misused in this way. The test of any theoretical approach will be the extent
to which it gives rise to practical and humane forms of intervention that produce
outcomes of benefit to the individual in relation to his or her social setting.
The holistic and interactional features of a biopsychosocial approach
make this a highly-persuasive tool when judged against these criteria.
