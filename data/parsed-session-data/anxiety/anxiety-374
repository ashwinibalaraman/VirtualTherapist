Although stress may not cause disease,
it has been established that stress
may be a risk factor for the development
of disease, may aggravate an existing
disease, and may reduce a compliance and
treatment success. As a result, many health
professionals frequently refer clients to clinical
health psychologists for help in dealing
with stress-related issues. Clients referred in
this manner frequently have a basic understanding
that emotional and psychological
factors influence health (often seen as the
mind influencing the body); however, they
frequently do not understand the mechanisms
involved in this process. Likewise, clinical
health psychologists may have an
in-depth understanding of effective treatment
methods for reducing stress while having
only an elementary understanding of the
physiological foundations that can help to
guide a more sophisticated conceptualization
and treatment for these disorders. The major
goals of this chapter are to (a) provide health
professionals with a model to use with
clients, (b) review the literature on models of
coping, and (c) provide information assessment
and treatment strategies.

<b>What Exactly is Stress?</b>

To understand the complexities of the construct
we call stress, it is important to have a basic
understanding of how the body is organized.
The body is a complex machine that functions
in a hierarchical manner. At the most basic
level, individual organs and tissues have self-regulating
properties that allow the body to
maintain normal function (homeostasis) when
external conditions are constant. However,
individual organs and tissues are not able to
respond to rapid changes (challenges) in the
environment or coordinate their responses with
other bodily systems. Therefore, higher levels in
the nervous system modulate the self-regulation
of tissues and organs when homeostasis is
threatened. Modulation in self-regulatory functioning
is achieved through the receipt of
sensory inputs, integrated control over target
tissues, endocrine outflow, and autonomic
function. This process is discussed in further
detail later in this chapter.


In its simplest form, stress involves a stressor
and stress response that challenge the
body's ability to maintain homeostasis. A
stressor is any physical or mental challenge to
the body that threatens homeostasis. Physical
stressors are events that challenge the body to

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A stress response may consist of both a
behavioral response and physiological
response. A behavioral response is any action
taken on the environment, such as quickly
leaving a dangerous situation or implementing
a coping skill, whereas a physiological response
is an alteration in physiological functioning
that serves to restore an imbalance in homeostatic
functioning. Examples of physiological
responses include an increase in blood pressure,
elevated heart rate, impaired memory and
decision-making abilities, and altered metabolism.
Both behavioral and physiological
responses to a stressor may be associated with
a negative affective state for the individual.


Most individuals can identify stressors they
experience in their daily lives as well as how
they experience the negative effects of stress.
However, what goes on between the stressor
and the stress response in terms of physiology
is less clearly understood by clients with
whom health professionals come into contact.
By educating clients on the psychological and
physiological mechanisms of stress, health
professionals can teach clients the adaptive
role of the stress response to episodic stressors
and the detrimental physical and psychological
effects caused by chronic long-term stress.


<b>
<i>Physiology of the Psychological
Stress Response</i>
</b>


After any external event occurs, sensory
information related to the event is processed
within the corticolimbic system (Figure 10.1).
In general, the corticolimbic system is responsible
for threat appraisals and the processing
of emotions. The corticolimbic system is
composed of multiple brain structures, including
the thalamus, sensory cortex, prefrontal
cortex, memory system, and amygdala. As an
individual experiences an external event in the
environment, sensory information is relayed
from the thalamus to the sensory cortex. From
the sensory cortex, the information is relayed
to the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible
for decision making and planning. Interestingly,
the prefrontal cortex is tied to the
person's memory system, so incoming information
is evaluated based on his or her prior
memories. The appraisal process is completed
in the prefrontal cortex, which communicates
with the amygdala, the region in the brain
where emotions are processed.


One of the main functions of the corticolimbic
system during the stress response is the
appraisal of potential threats in the environment.
Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) model of
coping distinguishes between two types of
appraisals that occur during a stress response.
A primary appraisal is responsible for determining
the magnitude of the threat such as
immediate danger. If a threat appraisal is
made, secondary appraisals help an individual
to evaluate ways in which to cope with the
stressor. For example, if a threat appraisal
indicates immediate danger, the corticolimbic
system immediately activates the peripheral
nervous system to signal the body to engage in
behaviors that initiate movement.


After primary and secondary appraisals
have been made indicating a threat, the
corticolimbic system also sends a message to
the hypothalamus in addition to the message
that was sent to the peripheral nervous system

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I014&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The hypothalamus, as a coordinator between
systems, also communicates with the endocrine
system during a stress response. There are two
main endocrine functions during a stress
response: the adrenocortical response and the
adrenomedullary response. The adrenocortical
response releases cortisol into the body during a
stress response. Cortisol is released through multiple
steps. First, the paraventricular nucleus of
the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF), which travels to the
pituitary gland. CRF causes the secretion of
adrenocorticotropin in the anterior pituitary
gland and the secretion of cortisol in the adrenal
cortex. Cortisol is then released from the
adrenal cortex. Cortisol as a hormone is always
present in the body, indicating its importance in
normal functioning, but the levels vary due to
both time of day (diurnal pattern) and current
stressors. Cortisol is responsible for increasing

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another stress hormone that is important
to the stress response is epinephrine, also
known as adrenaline. The adrenomedullary
response releases epinephrine into general circulation
in response to the increase in sympathetic
nervous system activity caused by the
release of cortisol. Epinephrine increases relative
to the stress response and assists in coordinating
bodily systems to make both
behavioral and metabolic changes necessary
to deal with the stressor. More specifically,
epinephrine stimulates heart muscles, increasing
heart rate and oxygen levels to prepare the
body to respond to the stressor.


After the first three components of a stress
response occur, regulation of the autonomic
nervous system and endocrine system is maintained
by negative feedback. Information on
cortisol and epinephrine output is sent from
tissues and organs to the brain stem, hypothalamus,
and corticolimbic system, where the
decision to continue production of cortisol
and epinephrine is made. If production of
these hormones is no longer needed, messages
are sent to the pituitary and adrenal glands to
discontinue output.


<b>
<i>Negative Physiological
Impacts of Chronic Stress</i>
</b>


Walter Cannon, a physiologist who first
introduced the term <i>stress</i>, distinguished
between short-term and long-term stressors
(Carlson, 1999). He discussed the fact that
physiologically we were built to deal with
episodic stressors rather than chronic stressors.
The stress response is designed to deal efficiently
with episodic stressors; however, there
are negative physiological and psychological
consequences when an individual is under
chronic stress. The negative physiological consequences
resulting from chronic stress are due
to the prolonged activation of the stress
response, which cannot be easily eliminated by
behavioral and psychological mechanisms.


If we reexamine the physiology of the stress
response, some of the negative consequences
of chronic stress become evident. To begin
with, cortisol and epinephrine, the hormones
released, during the stress response, have detrimental
effects when they are released continuously.
For example, one of the roles of cortisol
is to suppress the immune function, which
episodically is fine but which over a long
period of time leaves an individual susceptible
to illness (Lovallo, 1997). Chronic stress also
increases the amount of time it takes for a
wound to heal. For example, Kiecolt-Glaser,
Marucha, Malarkey, Mercado, and Glaser
(1995) examined the length of time it took for
punch biopsy wounds to heal in individuals
caring for a relative with Alzheimer's disease
and found that wounds took significantly
longer to heal in caregivers under chronic
stress in comparison with control participants.
The continuous release of cortisol also might
be related to the sleep problems commonly
reported among individuals experiencing
chronic stressors. As was mentioned earlier,
cortisol is released diurnally two times per
day: once during the morning and then again
after lunch. Researchers have found that the
continuous release of cortisol decreases rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep, which is essential
to normal sleep cycles (Vgontzas, Bixler, &amp;
Kales, 2000).


In addition, the release of epinephrine during
the stress response can put individuals
experiencing chronic stress at risk for cardiovascular
disease (Pollard, 2000). Epinephrine
stimulates cardiac muscles, resulting in an
increased heart rate and potentially hypertension.
Epinephrine also is involved in increasing
blood platelet adhesiveness and in reducing
clotting time, both of which are risk factors for
myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular
accidents (Markovitz &amp; Matthews, 1991).


Chronic stressors also can negatively affect
individuals psychologically. As discussed

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although the human body is designed to
deal with episodic stressors, chronic stress can
negatively affect both the physiological and
psychological functioning of an individual.
However, individual differences resulting from
both genetics and life experiences influence
how individuals respond to stressors. In fact,
two individuals who experience the same
traumatic event might react to the stressor
completely differently depending on each
individual's access to coping resources. By
studying how individuals respond to stress,
researchers have been able to develop coping
models for stress and to identify effective treatment
interventions designed to help individuals
develop coping skills.

<b>Models of Stress</b>

As noted previously, at the most basic level,
stress involves two processes: an environmental
event (stressor) and a physiological
response (stress response). Over the years,
models of stress have differentially focused on
these two components, with most contemporary
models focusing on stress as a transactional
process (Cassidy, 1999). A comprehensive
review of the strengths and weaknesses of each
model is beyond the scope of this chapter;
however, clinical health psychologists need to
have familiarity with these major approaches
and how these models are translated into
treatment options.


<b>
<i>Stimulus Models</i>
</b>


Stimulus models focus on environmental
events that produce demand on the organism.
Early research in this area (cf. Brown &amp;
Harris, 1978; Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967) led to
a focus on negative life events as a major
source of stress. Intervention efforts focused
on learning to deal more effectively with these
demands (coping) or on learning to predict
and (where appropriate) minimize exposure
to negative life events. Cassidy (1999) argued,
that these models primarily served a classification
role, providing researchers and clinicians
with necessary tools for identification of
individuals experiencing stress. Intervention,
particularly stress management strategies, has
moved beyond stimulus models.


<b>
<i>Response Models</i>
</b>


Stress is frequently identified by the presence
of specific symptoms that include overt
behavioral, physiological, and cognitive
symptoms. These symptoms are the natural
consequences of demand, and although one
cannot separate stress responses from stressors,
focus on response models has played a
major role in the development of treatment
strategies typically labeled "stress management"
(cf. Lehrer &amp; Woolfolk, 1993).


These models use a bottom-up explanation
rather than a top-down basis as in the
appraisal models. Much of the theory behind
these models comes out of biofeedback and
relaxation research as well as from Eastern
philosophy. The basic premise of these models
is that stress can be influenced by a person's
level of autonomic arousal. In other words, if
a person is experiencing high levels of arousal,
the person will feel as though he or she is
under more stress. If the arousal is reduced,
the person will subjectively experience lower

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In relation to this, it is believed that the
perception of controllability of arousal may
also influence stress levels. People who experience
high levels of arousal and do not feel
as though they can control that arousal may
report more stress than do people who experience
the same levels of arousal but feel as
though they have control over their arousal.


<b>
<i>Appraisal Models</i>
</b>


Appraisal models view psychological stress
as a process whereby an individual interprets
or views environmental events and perceived
coping ability that in turn shapes his or her
emotional, behavioral, and physiological
responses to events. Appraisal theories suggest
that the person "appraises" an event in an
attempt to discern its meaning in the context of
his or her experiences. These appraisals lead
to decisions regarding whether or not the
event is viewed as threatening or harmful and
what actions would be appropriate under the
circumstances.


Appraisal models are a natural outgrowth
of stimulus and response models. Appraisal of
an event by definition requires that an event
occur. Thus, it should be no surprise that many
events that would be labeled as stressors are in
fact appraised as high demand. Likewise, when
a person appraises an event as high demand,
the natural consequence of such an appraisal is
behaviors, emotions, and/or cognitions that fit
the definition of a stress response.


Lazarus's model (Lazarus, 1966, 1999;
Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) is the most widely
accepted stress model. As noted previously,
Lazarus divided the appraisal process into two
distinct parts: primary and secondary.
Primary appraisals are intended to determine
the threat value of an event. They take into
consideration the familiarity of the event, the
beliefs of the person, and commitments. An
event can be perceived as stressful or benign.
Stress appraisals, whether positive or negative,
lead to autonomic arousal.


Lazarus proposed three types of stress
appraisals: harm/loss, threat, and challenge.
Harm/loss appraisals occur in cases where
damage has already occurred. For instance, a
harm/loss appraisal would occur when a person
has become ill or injured, lost a loved one,
or suffered a blow to his or her self-esteem.
Threat appraisals occur when harm or loss
can be anticipated but has not yet occurred.
These are different from harm/loss appraisals
mainly in that threat appraisals allow the person
to plan and adapt to minimize or alleviate
some of the harm before it occurs. The third
type of stress appraisal is challenge. Challenge
appraisals are more positive in that the focus
is on opportunity to achieve growth or to gain
something from the event. These categories
are not necessarily exclusive. There may be,
and often are, situations in which threat and
challenge appraisals are experienced from the
same event.


Once primary appraisal determines that an
event is stressful, a person must choose what he
or she is going to do about the situation. This is
where secondary appraisals come in. Secondary
appraisals evaluate the person's available
options for coping with a stressful event and the
possible consequences of those actions. These
appraisals take into account personal resources
and the limitations of the environment.


Appraisals rarely occur in this linear fashion.
Rather, primary and secondary appraisals
may occur almost simultaneously, and changes
in the event, new information, and/or changes
in the level of perceived threat may alter a
person's appraisals. Lazarus referred to these
new appraisals as reappraisals. A person reappraises
an event when there are changes that
may affect the stressfulness of the event or his
or her ability to cope with it.


Coping responses are generated from the
appraisal process. According to Lazarus, coping
refers to constantly changing cognitive and

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Problem-focused strategies can be costly
early on because of the energy and time that
they require. However, they can lead to alterations
in the event that lessen its stress value
and so lessen the amount of coping that continues
to be needed. Emotion-focused strategies
are not as costly early on, but if the
situation remains stressful, these coping
responses can lead to a continued drain on
resources. Once a coping response has been
used, the situation is reappraised taking into
account changes a person has made to the situation
or his or her response to it. In this way,
the appraisal process is circular and recurrent.

<b>Symptoms of Chronic Stress</b>

Chronic exposure to stress can lead to a variety
of impairments in many domains. People who
are under chronic stress report a number of
symptoms. Some of these symptoms are vague
and do not greatly affect their functioning,
whereas others can be quite severe and
troubling to patients. Stress can lead to emotional
impairments such as inappropriate
crying, nervousness, edginess, anger, and irritability.
In addition, patients experiencing
chronic stress may feel overwhelmed, powerless,
and isolated. They may report general feelings
of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. They
may report feeling that life has no meaning anymore.
Some patients may appear cynical or
apathetic. They may report that they feel empty
or directionless, and they may have a strong
urge to try to prove themselves.


People experiencing chronic stress often
exhibit cognitive problems such as foggy thinking,
distractibility, and forgetfulness. They often
say that they cannot stop worrying. Some
patients report that they cannot seem to be creative
anymore or have no sense of humor.
Chronic stress can also lead to behavioral problems
and trouble in relationships. Stressed
people may be bossy and critical of others and
themselves. They may take up alcoholism or
smoking, or they may begin to eat or chew gum
compulsively. Spouses or partners of stressed
individuals often report that their significant
others grind their teeth in their sleep, have a
lowered sex drive, and have "clammed up."
Stressed, people may also seem resentful or
intolerant of others and may isolate themselves.


In addition to these impairments in a wide
range of functioning, people experiencing
chronic stress may experience a number of
physical symptoms. Patients commonly
report headaches, fatigue, restlessness, and
sleep disturbances. Patients also report unexplained
backaches, painful muscle tension,
and gastrointestinal discomfort such as stomachaches
and indigestion. Patients may also
have an increased heart rate and increased
blood pressure.


<b>
<i>Effects of Stress on Health</i>
</b>


As noted earlier, stress increases the risk of
disease. This can occur via the numerous

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00186&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Immune Function</i>. The immune function is
very complex, involving many different antibodies
and activities. One of the acute effects
of stress is to suppress immune functioning
and thereby increase infection susceptibility.
Stress leads to increased adrenaline secretion,
which suppresses the production of some antibodies,
decreases macrophage activity, and
decreases interleukin production. Reduced
immune function can increase a person's
chances of viral and bacterial infection, which
may lead to illnesses such as the common cold
and mononucleosis. For instance, Cohen,
Tyrrell, and Smith (1991) placed a cold virus
in the nasal passages of participants. They
found that participants who had reported high
levels of stress within the past year were much
more likely to become infected than were
those who reported low levels of stress.


<i>Cardiovascular Disease</i>. Stress may also
exacerbate or lead to cardiovascular disease.
Chronic stress elevates blood pressure and
serum cholesterol levels. In addition, some evidence
suggests that chronic central nervous
system hyperactivity reduces the body's sensitivity
to insulin, and this also increases blood
pressure.


<i>Gastrointestinal Disorders</i>. Stress also
affects the gastrointestinal tract. It can increase
colonic contractions or can lead to spasms in
the colon. There may also be increased muscle
tension in the abdominal area as well as
throughout the body. Stress may also increase
pain sensitivity. Consequently, people who
experience chronic stress may be seen for
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome,
Chron's disease, and general gastric discomfort.


<i>Sleep Disorders</i>. As listed previously, some
of the symptoms of stress include nervousness
and constant worrying. These symptoms, as
well as other stress effects, can lead to interruptions
in sleep patterns. Stress often leads
to insomnia and frequent nighttime waking.
Sleep efficiency is usually lowered, and people
may report feeling tired and worn out even
after receiving a full night's sleep.


<i>Anxiety and Depression</i>. As can be seen
from the list of symptoms earlier, stress often
leads to feelings of anxiety and depression, and
this can become a problem in itself for some
patients.


<i>Substance Abuse</i>. Some substances have a
stress-relieving effect, and some patients may
resort to substance abuse as a way of coping
with their high stress levels.

<b>Assessment of Stress and Treatment of Stress</b>

The exclusion of "stress disorders" from the
DSM-IV (<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders</i>, fourth edition [American
Psychiatric Association, 1994]) as a distinct
category has led to a wide variety of methods
used in the measurement of stress. From the
clinical health psychologist's perspective, the
most important criterion for diagnosing a
given complaint as a clinical stress problem is
the judgment that it is amenable to improvement
by changing the way in which the person
perceives or manages his or her
transactions with the immediate environment.
Therefore, the diagnosis of a clinical
stress problem has less to do with the etiology
or severity of the problem itself than
with the prediction of its responsiveness to
the teaching of coping skills.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00187&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


<b>
<i>Assessment</i>
</b>


One of the primary ways in which the
physician assesses preliminary signs of stress
is the patient's self-report via questionnaires
and/or a clinical interview. Self-report questionnaires
typically allow the patient to rate
whether a symptom is present or absent as
well as the severity of the symptom. Clinical
interviews are often designed to allow the
physician to use a checklist format for quick
and efficient diagnoses.


Two of the more frequently used scales to
assess stressors are the Life Events Survey
(Sarason, Johnson, &amp; Siegel, 1978) and the
Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale (Kanner,
Coyne, Schaefer, &amp; Lazarus, 1981). The Life
Events Survey consists of 57 items, and the
client checks each event that has ever happened,
to him or her. Then the client rates each
of these items positively or negatively in terms
of desirability and impact at the time the event
occurred. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale
from -3 to +3, with the sum indicating the
client's life events experience. Sarason and colleagues
(1978) noted that negative scores are
the best predictor of health problems.


The Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale was
developed to address more minor events in a
person's life. This 143-item survey has generated
enormous numbers of research studies
focusing on the types of stressors found for
individuals with various disease states (e.g.,
VanHoudenhove et al., 2002) as well as on
differences in stressful experiences of particular
high-risk populations (e.g., McCallum,
Arnold, &amp; Bolland, 2002). In addition, psychometric
research evaluating the questionnaire
indicates that for some populations, the order
in which items are presented influences ratings.
Specifically, events are rated as less uplifting
when they follow hassle items than when they
precede hassle items (Mayberry et al., 2002).


Life events can also be measured as part of a
structured, or unstructured interview. Brown
and Harris (1978) developed a structured
interview format called the Bedford College
Interview for Life Events and Difficulties, which
has been found to be both reliable and potentially
more useful because it allows trained
raters to evaluate contextual factors surrounding
specific life events. For example, someone
who lost a parent following a prolonged illness
that preceded the death may view the "loss of a
parent" event quite differently from someone
who lost a parent in an unexpected accident.


Symptoms of stress can be measured using
common emotional scales, including the
Spielberger anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch,
Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983) and anger
(Spielberger, 1996) scales (for a review, see
Spielberger, Sydeman, Owen, &amp; Marsh,
1999), the Beck inventories (Beck Depression
Inventory-II [Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996] and
Beck Anxiety Inventory [Beck, 1990]), and
broad-based measures such as the Symptom
Checklist 90-Revised (Derogatis, 1975).


<b>
<i>Treatment</i>
</b>


The treatment of stress disorders often falls
into one of two types: treatments aimed at
reducing central nervous system activation
and treatments designed to address problems
in appraisal or coping skills. Treatment techniques
that involve the alteration of appraisals
often incorporate cognitive strategies to alter
and improve the competitiveness-readiness
level, whereas central nervous system activation
reduction techniques focus on lowering
or controlling physiological arousal, anxiety,
and muscular tension. It should be noted that
the term <i>stress management</i> is typically used
to describe a number of treatment techniques
designed to reduce stress rather than referring
to any one specific method. Lehrer and
Woolfolk provided detailed chapters on the
methods and approaches that fit this broad
category of "stress management" (Lehrer &amp;
Woolfolk, 1993; Woolfolk &amp; Lehrer, 1984).
In the current chapter, several of the most
common methods are merely outlined.

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00188&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Treatments That Focus on Central
Nervous System Reduction</i>


Relaxation methods encompass a range of
techniques, each with unique properties; however,
all share the goal of creating a relaxation
response. This response is designed to activate
the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting
in a decrease in oxygen consumption, heart
rate, respiration, and skeletal muscle activity
along with an increase in skin resistance and
alpha brain waves. Four factors have been
identified as important for eliciting a relaxation
response: a mental device (a word, a
phrase, or an object to shift attention inward),
a passive attitude, decreased muscle tonus,
and a quiet environment. The ultimate goal of
relaxation training is to evoke the relaxation
response to counter situational stress.


<i>Progressive Relaxation</i>. Modern progressive
relaxation techniques were derived from
Edmond Jacobson's work during the early part
of the 20th century. The main premise of his
approach was that it is impossible to be nervous
or tense when skeletal muscles are completely
relaxed. Jacobson noted that relaxation
is a fundamental physiological occurrence that
consists of systematically learning to elongate
muscle fibers. For this reason, the use of suggestion
by the progressive relaxation instructor
should be abandoned given that the perception
of relaxation is not so important as actual
physiological relaxation (McGuigan, 1993).


Jacobson's full progressive relaxation procedure
involves systematically tensing and
relaxing specific muscle groups in a predetermined
order and was described in great
detail by McGuigan (1993). The individual is
instructed to tense a muscle before relaxing it
to help him or her recognize the difference
between tension and relaxation. To first
become familiar with the sensation of tension,
the learner is instructed to lie on his or her
back with arms at the sides and to bend the
wrist up at a 90-degree angle. The learner perceives
tension in the forearm. Next the learner
performs much of the same task except that
this time the wrist is bent at a 45-degree
angle, producing less tension. This method is
repeated again at increasingly smaller angles.
Using this method of diminishing tensions
teaches the learner to detect not only high tension
but even the most minute tension.


Relaxation begins with the instructor
explaining the basic physiology of neuromuscular
circuits and the nature of tension and
relaxation. The learning environment can be
quite varied; classrooms, gymnasiums, and
conference rooms all provide learners with
something soft to lie on such as mats, blankets,
or thick carpets. In clinical treatment,
individual rooms with cots, pillows, and blankets
are often provided. It should be noted
that complete elimination of external distraction
is not desired because the normal environment
in which the individual will be
relaxing can be quite noisy. Relaxation starts
with the muscles of the left arm and proceeds
to the right arm, left and right legs, abdomen,
back, chest, and shoulder muscles and then
concludes with the neck and face muscles. The
starting position is with the learner lying on
his or her back, with the arms by the sides.
Only one position is practiced each hour. The
control signal, which for the position with
the hand bent back is the vague sensation in
the upper surface of the forearm, is observed
three times during each period. This is the
critical signal that the individual is to learn
and recognize. The tensed position is held for
a minute or so, and then the "power goes off"
(relaxing the signal away) for a few minutes.


During this initial session, the learner will
make a few common mistakes, and it is the
instructor's crucial job to catch and correct

The amount of time required to learn progressive
relaxation may seem excessive from a
naive learner's point of view. Attempts to shorten
the process have not yielded satisfactory results.
Jacobson explained that a body that has been
practicing overtension for decades will not be
able to reverse the process in brief sessions.
Children, however, have been shown to learn
progressive relaxation quite rapidly, probably
because they have not had as many years practicing
maladaptive tension habits.


<i>Abbreviated Progressive Relaxation
Training</i>. Condensed versions of progressive
relaxation have been linked to the work of
Wolpe (1958), who developed a "short" version
of progressive relaxation for treating
phobias (Bernstein &amp; Carlson, 1993).
Abbreviated progressive relaxation was
standardized and popularized by Bernstein
and Borkovec (1973) in their classic text,
<i>Progressive Relaxation Training</i>, and is the
source citation for many clinical intervention
studies using progressive relaxation (Hillenberg
&amp; Collins, 1982).


Bernstein and Carson (1993) provided a
detailed review of abbreviated procedures,
which are summarized here. In the initial
training session, 16 muscle groups are the
focus of tension release procedures. The client
is typically asked to recline during the introduction.
The order in which the muscle groups
are taught is standardized, and the therapist
demonstrates the tensing methods and then
paces the client through the series of tension
release procedures. The client is encouraged to
practice relaxation skills twice a day, 15 to 20
minutes each time, with continued training in
sessions paced by the therapist.


<i>Autogenic Training</i>. Autogenic training
was developed by Johannes Heinrich Schultz
following his own observations of individuals
under hypnosis and Oskar Vogt's observations
in brain research (Linden, 1993). Schultz
noticed, that hypnotized patients would report
a heaviness of the limbs and a warmth sensation.
Hypnosis was believed to be something
that patients allowed to happen to themselves,
not something that the therapist did to them.
The objective of autogenic training is to permit
self-regulation in either direction (deep
relaxation or augmentation of a physiological
activity) through "passive concentration,"
also described as "self-hypnosis." Training
can be taught individually or in groups. The
ideal setting should be one at room temperature,
slightly darkened, with a couch or exercise mats
and pillows.


<i>Biofeedback Methods</i>. In general, biofeedback
systems operate by detecting changes in
the biological environment and conveying this
information to the client in the form of visual
and auditory signals (Stoyva &amp; Budzynski,
1993). The client then synthesizes this information
with a trial-and-error strategy to cause
the signals to change in the desired direction;
thus, the client learns how to control the biological
response system. It is further intended
that the client will be gradually weaned away
from the biofeedback signal, allowing for the
transfer of control into everyday life.


The most common form of biofeedback
used in stress management is electromyographic
(EMG) feedback. EMG feedback operates
by detecting biological signals and
providing visual or auditory signals linked to
this biological system via amplification of the
psychophysiological measures. This immediate
feedback is thought to facilitate learning to control
or reduce arousal through trial-and-error
strategies designed to produce changes in the
signal in a desired direction (Stoyva &amp;
Budzynski, 1993).

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />


EMG feedback offers a number of specific
advantages as compared with traditional non-biofeedback
relaxation therapies in that it
provides a direct measure of client learning
through the monitoring of muscular activity
rather than depending on the client's verbal
report of relaxation. EMG data quantify
physiological relationships and operationalize
the concept of relaxation. Some drawbacks
associated with biofeedback are that the client
may become dependent on the machine and
that it provides minimal training in coping
strategies for reducing tension.


<i>Yoga-Based Stress Management</i>. Yoga
methods have had the most popularity in the
treatment of hypertension (Patel, 1993). This
technique appears to reduce stress in part by
helping the client to reframe the stressor in a
nonthreatening fashion. Yoga, which means
"union," is an Indian philosophy that presents
various values, techniques, and disciplines to
teach ways of establishing harmony by developing
the mind among the various sides of life. The
sides of human life are both material (body) and
nonmaterial (mind and soul). Different techniques
or combinations are used depending on
whether one's intellect, emotions, or actions dominate.
The main components of yoga include
14 breathing exercises (which facilitate regulation
of the mind and body), 200 balanced physical
postures (which help to prevent musculoskeletal
deterioration), and exercises for awakening
"kundalini" (the energy reservoir at the base of
the spinal cord). Yoga is based, on a belief that life
can be conceptualized as a gaseous exchange that
takes place between "inspired" (oxygenated) air
and the blood circulating in the lungs. Deep
muscle relaxation, visualization, and meditation
all are components of yoga-based therapies,
further illustrating yoga's emphasis ranging from
the physical to the spiritual in nature. For a more
in-depth review of yoga methods, the reader
is referred to Patel (1993), who provides a
detailed summary of these methods.


<i>Meditation</i>. Although meditation is often
viewed as a yoga-based technique, Carrington
(1978) introduced a "clinically standardized
meditation procedure" that appears to be useful
for reducing stress symptoms in a range of
health-related disorders (see also Carrington,
1993). Meditation can be divided into two distinct
forms: concentrative and nonconcentrative.
The concentrative forms of meditation are
simple to learn. The techniques are often practiced
in a quiet environment, with the object of
the meditator's attention being a mentally
repeated sound, the meditator's breath, or some
other appropriate focal sound (e.g., running
water). If attention is found to be wandering, the
meditator is directed back to the attentional
object in an unforceful manner. A nonconcentrative
technique expands the meditator's attentional
field to include as much of his or her
conscious mental activity as possible. In this
sense, the specific techniques of meditation are
secondary to the actual experience of meditation
in bringing about therapeutic change.


In summary, there are many paths to the
reduction of sympathetic nervous system
activation, producing a shift toward lower
arousal characterized by parasympathetic
nervous system dominance. Because the
stress response is characterized by a heightened
sympathetic tone, shifting autonomic
dominance to the parasympathetic nervous
system should, be effective in moderating
stress and anxiety reactions regardless of the
methods used. Schwartz (1993) pointed out
that although numerous methods are available
for stress management, client characteristics
may lead the therapist to consider
alternative strategies that might best fit
clients' life histories and experiences and
that might be more appealing to clients.
Therapists who develop skills in multiple
methods will be in a better position to provide
clients with methods that are both
evidence based and philosophically consistent
with client expectations.

<b>Cognitive Approaches to Stress</b>

Cognitive approaches conceptualize stress
as the result of an active cognitive set that
includes successive appraisals of environmental
demands and the risks, costs, and gains of
specific coping responses. When an individual's
vital interests appear to be challenged, cognitive
processes provide a selective conceptualization
of what is occurring. Beck (1993) provided an
in-depth review of cognitive approaches to
stress management that are summarized in the
current chapter.


The initial appraisal of an event can be
considered a quick scan to determine whether
it is pleasant, neutral, or noxious. When the
vital interests (harm or enhancement) of an
individual (egocentric view) are assessed to be
affected, a critical response ensues. An emergency
critical response is activated when the
individual perceives a threat to his or her survival,
domain, individuality, or status. This
response is critical to the development of stress
reactions. At the same time the situation is
evaluated as a threat, the individual is assessing
his or her resources for dealing with the
ensuing problem. This assessment is labeled
"secondary appraisal" (Lazarus, 1966).


The basic rationale behind, the treatment of
stress from a cognitive perspective is that certain
idiosyncratic cognitive patterns become
hyperactive and lead to the overmobilization
of the voluntary nervous system and autonomic
nervous system. When this occurs, the
protective buffers and adaptive functions (e.g.,
objectivity, perspective, reality testing) are
rendered ineffective against the cognitive constellation
that has been triggered. This overmobilization
directly results in reactive
syndromes (e.g., anxiety, hostility) or psychosomatic
syndromes. In the long term, these
physical effects can lead to dysfunction of specific
systems or organs (e.g., musculoskeletal,
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal). Therefore,
the ultimate goal of therapy is to reduce the
dominance of the controlling constellation of
cognitions and to allow the protective buffers'
adaptive functions to take over.


An initial treatment approach often
includes directly reducing the exposure of the
stressful stimuli to the individual. This serves
to reduce the intensity of the cognitive constellations,
reduce the mobilization of the
neuromuscular endocrine system, and increase
perspective and objectivity. This sets the stage
for the individual to now reflect on his or her
reactions, test other options, and adopt a
broader and more realistic view of the situation.
The specific terms for the previously
described treatment are as follows: identifying
automatic thoughts ("What am I thinking
now?"), recognizing and correcting cognitive
distortions ("It does not have to mean this; it
is probably that"), and identifying the broad
beliefs and assumptions that underlie the
hyperactive constellations ("I'm a bad person
and I don't deserve good things"). The process
described previously outlines the process
known as cognitive restructuring or the ABC
approach. The premise is that the antecedent
or event leads to thoughts and feelings that
ultimately drive the individual's behavior. By
changing the way in which the individual
thinks about the events, the person will be able
to change his or her behavior. In respect to this
chapter, the individual will be able to reduce
the stress response by "seeing the problem in
another light" using this systematic approach.


<i>
<b>Stress Inoculation Training</b>
</i>


Stress inoculation training is based on the
premise that bolstering (inoculating) an individual's
repertoire of coping responses to
milder stressors can serve to defuse responses
to major life stressors (for a more extensive
review, see Meichenbaum, 1993). This is

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284031-I00192&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second phase focuses on coping skills
acquisition and rehearsal of these skills.
Attention is paid to removing factors that
may interfere with adequate coping such as
maladaptive beliefs and feelings of low self-efficacy.
The skills are practiced initially in
the training setting, with gradual introduction
in vivo.


The final phase of stress inoculation training
calls for the client to apply the variety of learned.
coping skills across increasing levels ("inoculation")
of stressors on a graduated basis. This is
accomplished by imagery and behavioral
rehearsal, modeling, role-playing, and graded in
vivo exposure. Attention is also allocated to
relapse prevention. The client is taught how to
handle a lapse and not allow for it to become a
relapse. In summary, stress inoculation training
combines client self-monitoring, cognitive
restructuring, problem solving, self-instructional
and relaxation training, behavioral and imagined,
rehearsal, and environmental change, with
the goal of enabling the client to be flexible in
his or her coping repertoire and to have the
confidence to cope resourcefully.


<i>
<b>Summary</b>
</i>


As this brief review illustrates, there are
many approaches to stress management.
Cognitive approaches focus on a "top-down"
method, with the primary goal being the reduction
of cognitions that, if unchecked, begin a
cascade of behavioral and biological processes
that include autonomic nervous system arousal
and endocrine activation. Through the modification
of appraisal processes, an individual
is able to minimize threat and demand,
thereby reducing levels of the stress response.
Treatments that focus on central nervous
system reduction directly can be conceptualized
as "bottom-up" methods that directly influence
behavioral and biological processes. In addition,
some central nervous system reduction
methods have been shown to directly influence
cognitive processes that show up as enhanced
coping and reduced perception of demand
based on the individual's "knowing" that he or
she now has the skill to reduce arousal directly.
The following case study illustrates this point.

<b>Conclusions</b>

This chapter has provided an overview of the
biological and psychosocial factors related to
stress. A great deal of attention was given to the
biological mechanisms involved in the stress
response because this is an aspect of training
that is often lacking. As the case study illustrates,
assessment and treatment may at times
focus on behavioral and cognitive factors; however,
knowledge of the biology of stress may
help clients to accept psychological treatment.


The treatment methods presented in this
chapter were, by necessity, merely summarized.
Therapists who have not used relaxation or
other anxiety reduction methods should seek
out supervised experiences before using these
with clients. What at times seems very easy to
do can in fact be much more complicated than
it appears. As should be noted from both the
case study and the early work of Jacobson, it
takes a great deal of therapist time to successfully
train relaxation skills. Merely sending
clients home with a taped session is not sufficient.
Likewise, the cognitive interventions
require systematic training and should not be
attempted without supervised experiences.

<b>Case Study</b>

"Jane M." was referred by her physician for treatment of stress that was thought
to be linked to her frequent headaches. Jane had recently been promoted to a managerial
position with her company, and the new position required that she visit
regional offices in nearby states on a frequent basis. She was on the road several
days each week, and for the past 6 months she reported constant fatigue and frequent
headaches. While fatigued and tired, she found it difficult to relax at night
while on the road.


Baseline assessment included the Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale, the
Spielberger State-Trait Anger Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and a
clinical interview. Results indicated mild levels of depression and moderate to
severe levels of anger. The anger appeared to be most linked, to Jane's dissatisfaction
with the staff at many of the hotels where she stayed and her inability to
be "treated with the respect that she deserved" when problems arose. There were
few life events rated as positive, with many minor annoyances receiving very
negative ratings.


Although it seemed clear that Jane's stress levels were at times generated by her
perceptions of events and expectations that she "should" be treated more respectfully,
it was also obvious from early sessions that she was physiologically very tense
and quite concerned that her physician believed her problems were all "mental."
The therapist spent a great deal of time discussing how negative events start a chain
of physiological processes that lead to heightened arousal that for some people
result in headaches or other physical problems. For some clients, merely learning
to reduce this arousal can be useful. Jane showed a strong interest in learning how
to reduce physical arousal, and a treatment plan was developed that initially
focused on learning relaxation skills.


The relaxation method used was a form of abbreviated progressive relaxation
training developed by Charles R. Carlson (Carlson, Collins, Nitz, Sturgis, &amp;
Rogers, 1990; Carlson, Ventralla, &amp; Sturgis, 1987; Kay &amp; Carlson, 1992) called
stretch-based relaxation. Stretch-based relaxation focuses on stretching of muscles,
facilitating a differentiation of muscle sensations that contributes to a recognition
of muscle tension and fosters relaxation of the muscles.


Training was conducted over an 8-week period, with in-session relaxation training
taking between 30 and 40 minutes of each session. The remaining time was
spent discussing the application of stretch-based relaxation to Jane's daily routine
and fine-tuning home practice. Her initial response was that she could not produce
the levels of relaxation at home that she experienced in sessions, and these concerns
and expectations were addressed with a reminder that she would improve with
continued practice. At Session 5, she reported feeling much more effective at home,
and in-session training switched from being therapist-led training to client-paced
training with the therapist observing Jane's performance.

At Session 6, Jane reported a critical incident where she was checking into a
hotel and the night clerk could not find her reservation. It took some time for the
clerk to come up with a suitable room, and in the past she would have become
physically tense and extremely angry and would have developed a headache that
would keep her from sleeping well. She remembered thinking to herself that if she
got tense from this "incompetent clerk," she would just use her relaxation skills to
calm down once she was in her room and could avoid getting a headache. Not only
did she not get a headache that evening, she did not even feel tense while waiting.
Discussion with her therapist indicated that the knowledge that she "knew what to
do if she got tense" seemed to ward off feelings of tension. She began to entertain
the idea that it was not merely the situation that "got her tense"; rather, it was her
reaction to the situation (including the expectancy that a headache would ensue)
that contributed to her tension.


Sessions 7 and 8 involved a minor review of stretch-based relaxation, with a great
deal of the sessions devoted to discussion of how Jane planned to implement this new
skill in her life to keep herself more relaxed. Readministration of the Daily Hassles
and Uplifts Scale indicated that the number of situations did not change but that the
perception of the situations as negative was greatly improved. Headaches had
dropped off significantly with more relaxed sleep and energy. Jane was encouraged
to continue formally practicing relaxation on at least a weekly basis.
