BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you very much.  Okay, so you—
<b>PT:</b>	Can I keep this or?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you can keep that if you like.  It gives you some information.  Um, was today your first day back?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	How are things looking for the upcoming year?
<b>PT:</b>	Well I don't know.  It looks like they could be busier than, well I can't really tell.  It's the beginning of the year, but it looks like I might have some busy, uh, be busy with some students that are severely visually impaired and not as retarded as the other ones.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow, what do you think about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it might be a little bit more interesting.  I'll have to see—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I'm not even sure.  They're coming from other cities and, you know, I don't know much about them, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.  Now are they relocating to this area because of the, of the program or?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I doubt it.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	But, um, I have to look into it some more because I don't know how, you know, what kind of placement they'll need because the 3 of them are, are either legally blind or totally, totally blind.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And some are, um, have learning disabilities and all sorts of other things too.
<b>DR:</b>	Are they being bussed from other states?
<b>PT:</b>	No, no, they just moved here.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  So—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, all right, yeah, so—
<b>PT:</b>	And they're not in the system, so they don't know about them yet.
<b>DR:</b>	I see, yeah.  So yeah, so you're so much [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't know.  Tomorrow I'll find out a little bit more about them.
<b>DR:</b>	It could be interesting.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it could be or it could be a lot of paperwork which is what I hate, but, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Whatever comes at me, I got to take so.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, I felt the summer was over a long time ago.  As soon as they say back to school on TV, I know—
<b>DR:</b>	I know.
<b>PT:</b>	That's it for me, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	God, it's amazing.
<b>PT:</b>	I can't get much sympathy from other people who aren't teachers because they can't believe that I have the summer off anyway, so.
<b>DR:</b>	I know, but it's all relative because teachers are never paid what they're worth, and then you did take on some extra work this summer, but then they turned it into much more.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Than they did previously.  So, you know, that was pretty stressful for a while.
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't seen you for a while, have I?
<b>DR:</b>	It's been since, um, mid July.
<b>PT:</b>	So did I see you after I quit?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you had just quit then because you realized they were like piling on so much more—
<b>PT:</b>	They were piling it up and—
<b>DR:</b>	Than it used to be.
<b>PT:</b>	And also, um, almost like stalking us, you know, seeing where we are at every moment of the day.  We have to account for every minute.
<b>DR:</b>	That was awful, as if you don't have enough paperwork as it is.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I quit and so did my friend who also does what I do.  She quit too.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	But, uh, then a week later I found out that I would have had to quit anyway.
<b>DR:</b>	Really, why?
<b>PT:</b>	Well I had woke up and felt, well now it's about 5 or 6 months ago, with a stiff neck—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	And like after about 3 or 4 months I said, you know, this is ridiculous like how could my neck still be stiff, you know.  I changed my pillows and everything.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I went to the doctor and he thought I had arthritis so he took an x—ray and then I had to take, make a long story short, I had to get, um, MRIs done of my neck.  So I have bulging discs.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	And arthritis and a little bit of scoliosis.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So for a while, this today, driving here was the longest I've driven all summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my gosh.
<b>PT:</b>	I wasn't allowed to drive at all for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And I went to this special doctor who deals with physical problems, therapy problems.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So, uh, I had to wear a collar for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, and she gave me steroids because I was all swollen.  The nerve canal or whatever in the, in the spine was just like a little tight from swelling.
<b>DR:</b>	I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	So now my neck cracks all over the place because the swelling's down and, and now the bones are going against each other.  So, she still limited me to driving short distances—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And not going downtown where I would have to look left and right all the time—
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Traffic and so it's been nice.  My wife has been driving me everywhere, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.  Is she here now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, today is your first day out on your own.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, not my first on my own, but first of this length.
<b>DR:</b>	This long, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but it's not that bad.  The road is long and not many lefts and rights, so, um, it's been a pain literally.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	All summer it's been, uh, I've been limited by that.  So I would have had to quit my job anyway because I couldn't drive for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because she wanted to give my neck a rest.  So, you know, I thought I just had a stiff neck.  It was like all of a sudden I, I woke up with this.  It's like.
<b>DR:</b>	That's so odd.  Were you aware of any scoliosis or anything like that before?
<b>PT:</b>	Well I have scoliosis in my lower back.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I guess it just goes, curves up.
<b>DR:</b>	Amazing.  Wow, how strange for it to get aggravated now.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	I guess over time, you know, maybe the stresses on the back and then—
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] but the MRI showed that there's, there's arthritis there and the both of play against each other, the bulging discs and the arthritis.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And, um, but anyway, that's what, my whole summer was changed.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, because you were going to work on the car and everything—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And that was probably going to be pretty difficult to do with that condition.
<b>PT:</b>	That's another story.  I haven't had the car all summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I gave it to the mechanic because there was something that I just couldn't do.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And he's kept it all summer—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because the parts were hard to get or whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I didn't have any car to work on during the summer and my movement was limited.  So the summer was pretty yucky.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, that's too bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Plus my wife's mother has got creeping dementia.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh my goodness.
<b>PT:</b>	So we had to do a lot with that too during the summer.
<b>DR:</b>	And she's living on her own, right?
<b>PT:</b>	She lives on her own, but now she's going to have somebody there like 8 hours a day.
<b>DR:</b>	That would be great.
<b>PT:</b>	Anyway, the summer was taken up by this and that, and we got away a few times, but it was still not what I envisioned.
<b>DR:</b>	I remember you had been hoping to travel, and.
<b>PT:</b>	Well we did go away to bed and breakfasts 3 times.
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	So that we did.  It's just in between all that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It was like, almost like we had to escape in order to.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  That was really smart that you did too, but I know you had talked about Israel and Buenos Aires and.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah, not for this summer.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe next summer we'll do Israel, but I don't know if I should try summer school again because I have a feeling that, um, I might really need the money because they haven't completed the contract for the school district.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And they're $30 million in the hole and I don't know if they're going to want to give us a raise.
<b>DR:</b>	So they might require extra credentials [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>PT:</b>	No, they might, they just don't, my city just don't have the money, and they might start hitting our medical insurance, you know, and making us pay for that because we don't pay for that now.
<b>DR:</b>	These are such difficult times.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's like.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know what's going to happen to that so I might have to work in the summer if they're not going to give me any money.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	But, uh—
<b>DR:</b>	It's hard to know what to count on.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't know what to count on because we can't strike.  We have to take almost what they give us.  So.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not right.  You know, how teachers are treated and [INAUDIBLE] school district.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, it's awful.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just, it's worse.  So I don't know.  So anyway, the summer was just not.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] back raises.
<b>PT:</b>	Back raises, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Just, you know, I don't, I mean I'm back.  I'm not, I'm not, you know, sad that I'm back.  It's just that I'm sad that I didn't have the timing, the rest to really.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	So, I'm going to physical therapy a couple times a week for my neck.
<b>DR:</b>	It helps the pain.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, sometimes my neck gets stuck and I move it and then it cracks, then I get pain.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	But it's not long lasting.  It's just when it cracks.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, so I mean I can turn like this and it's cracking all the time, but they're just bigger, big cracks and little cracks.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So, anyway, I got this traction device that my therapist told me to get, and you lie down on it.  It pulls your head up.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, to, um, you know, create more space between the vertebrae I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have to do that when you sleep?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I haven't used it yet because he has to show me how.  I just got it on Ebay.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I got a good deal on it, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Good for you.  That was smart.
<b>PT:</b>	My wife's been pulling my head every night just for, you know, hopefully around 20 seconds.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But when I use this device, I won't have to do that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Like when you're watching TV or whenever, you could just—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, you have to lie on the floor and then it like, it pulls your head up an inclined pump, pump this thing and it pulls your head.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Pulls it back, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, I was going to say, my gosh.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean they say that they can stop it from getting much worse—
<b>DR:</b>	That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	If I can do stuff like this.
<b>DR:</b>	Now that the warning signs are there.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you getting enough calcium and so forth for healthy bones?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I mean I'm not drinking a lot of milk or anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	They didn't tell me to take more calcium.
<b>DR:</b>	They didn't talk about calcium supplements or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	What about glucosamine?  Anything for the joint lubrication?
<b>PT:</b>	No, they didn't say anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But maybe that's a question I have to ask the, the, um, doctor when I go see her this week.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I know opinions are divided on the—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Glucosamine chondrotin MSM question.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It's a tough call.  Well how are your spirits holding up with all this?
<b>PT:</b>	I've been having more anxiety—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Attacks, not constant like it was, but I've been having them, and, uh, because I'm worried.  I mean it seems like I'm [AGE] but my body's been falling apart for the last 20 years.
<b>DR:</b>	It's so hard.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and before, you know, I'd get old people diseases like diverticulitis and you know, have operations for all this stuff and my heart.  So it's just another nail in the coffin, you know, sort of.
<b>DR:</b>	It's frustrating.  Well and Bette Davis said getting older ain't for sissies.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's not, you know.  I look at my mother in law and see what she's going through.  She's [AGE] and she's withering away.  You know, to see myself at [AGE], you know, having these problems, um.  They're not because I don't exercise much or, or don't eat right or whatever.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're pretty fit.
<b>PT:</b>	I was sort of born with the tendencies to—
<b>DR:</b>	Many people aren't.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Even with cancer, you know, they're starting to think more and more, it's genetic fetus position and if you're getting certain viruses, that could start the cascade going and.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean my father had terrible arthritis in his shoulder.  It was like almost dissolved.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	It was like it went down like this.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are they thinking it's rheumatoid or degenerative?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think so.  That's more, that's more serious rheumatoid.
<b>DR:</b>	And sometimes it's more sort of system wide—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And it sounds like you're talking about specific areas.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I have it in my hands too.
<b>DR:</b>	So you did.
<b>PT:</b>	But, but when I took the steroids.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	My hands no longer feel, no longer hurt because I guess they were swollen too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So the joints were swollen.  So now I don't hurt at all on my hands.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you, um, still take steroids on a regular basis?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she actually did it—
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	On a like a 12 day descending order.  I started off with like 8, then 7, then, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	She kept—
<b>DR:</b>	To control [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	She did it just to get rid of the swelling.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But not to keep me on it.
<b>DR:</b>	And it resolved, that's great.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it changed everything.  You know, I wasn't hearing the cracking in my neck because the neck was so swollen.  I would just turn my head.  I could turn my head to here which I still can't turn very far.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And, and that was it, but now it's, it's only [INAUDIBLE] cracking.  Anyway.
<b>DR:</b>	Any other body aches or pains or weird rashes?
<b>PT:</b>	I have weird aches in my face.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	Which I was going to ask you about.
<b>DR:</b>	Really?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well I don't know I'm doing it all the time, but my wife says that I am, but I'm moving my jaw constantly.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	And maybe you've seen it, but you know.
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, it's like I'm ruminating, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	And as the day goes on my face starts to, it feels like I have severe toothaches on both sides and for a while I was thinking of having my teeth, tooth pulled.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But the dentist said there's not, they're not impacting on each other.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So, but it feels like that, but my doctor said that, you know, it's just tension in the base or something like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Any facial droop or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's just like terrible aching that nothing relieves.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow, not even—
<b>PT:</b>	Well my wife—
<b>DR:</b>	Traditional like pain killers like ibuprofen or anything.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I was taking Aleve.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Like a lot of Aleve and nothing, and that doesn't do anything, and I would think that that would do it.
<b>DR:</b>	You would think it would.
<b>PT:</b>	And I've tried, well Tylenol doesn't do anything to me, and I even tried, the doctor gave me Darvocet for my neck because of the pain.  I tried that just, just to see if it would help and that didn't do anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I was going to ask you if any of the medication I take, could, could that be a side effect?  I, I, my wife thought it was probably the Provigil because I take so much Provigil, but I didn't—
<b>DR:</b>	Two hundred milligram twice a day is pretty standard dose.
<b>PT:</b>	I stopped taking it.  I haven't—
<b>DR:</b>	You did?
<b>PT:</b>	I stopped taking it for 2 weeks.  I didn't tell her that.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	Because she would get angry at me, but I stopped taking it for 2 weeks.
<b>DR:</b>	Did you notice any difference?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  How was your attention and concentration affected when you stopped?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, I was a little sleepy in the mornings—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Some mornings.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Not every morning, but some mornings.  I mean I started to take 1 instead of 2 a day—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Just to get back into it because I got to drive to work now.
<b>DR:</b>	Exactly.
<b>PT:</b>	But during the summer I could mess with it, but—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I don't know.  I mean any other like Lamictal or Cymbalta or anything like that could cause this because I've had it for a long time.  I just never mentioned it to you because I thought it was my teeth.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	And I just can't figure out how to get rid of the pain, like not pain, but the ache.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Now the Lamictal, that came into the picture back in the spring of '07.  Um, do you remember if it existed before that, this pain?
<b>PT:</b>	The spring of '07?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so over a year ago.
<b>PT:</b>	It might have.  My wife doesn't tell me all the time when I'm doing it—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	But sometimes I catch myself and then I try and relax my jaw, you know, and I can't do it.  In fact, I look forward to going to sleep because in the morning I wake up without, without it.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I guess that's the only time my face can really relax is when I'm asleep.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	It's like I just can't do it on my own.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, let me just review with you, there's also the Geodon in the picture, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	The 80 two a day.
<b>PT:</b>	And Ativan.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh—huh, the Cymbalta.
<b>PT:</b>	And Synthroid.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, are you taking any Seroquel now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That was the one I would go.  Do you remember if it predates the Geodon at all?
<b>PT:</b>	I've been taking Geodon for years, so I don't think it predated that.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I had, I did do, you did have me increase the Geodon to double because of the, I think it was you.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.
<b>PT:</b>	For anxiety attacks I was having.
<b>DR:</b>	Let me see.
<b>PT:</b>	And that [INAUDIBLE] my anxiety attacks.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, and I think that started probably with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] because you were taking the 80 two a day in 2006 back when you were with her, and she doesn't note here about increasing it, but you saw her at another location previously.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, just for a short time.
<b>DR:</b>	So that could have been discussed then.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't remember this being back that far, so probably not.  I probably would have killed myself or something because it's terrible.
<b>DR:</b>	You take both Geodon together at the same time at that time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, at night.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it make you very sleepy?
<b>PT:</b>	No, nothing makes me sleepy, even the Lunesta or whatever I take.
<b>DR:</b>	Does the, um, does the jaw stiffness tend to be worse at a certain time of day?  What time of day usually?
<b>PT:</b>	Well it starts getting worse like early afternoon and then by nighttime it's like full blown.  Morning is okay for a while.  You know, I just feel it coming on and my wife says my face is always moving.  I have sores in my mouth as if I chewed my, uh, gum, um, cheeks, but, um, you know, I'm trying to control it right now.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I can control it if I'm thinking about it just so it doesn't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	There could be a couple of different factors at work.  One thing that immediately comes to mind is the possibility that you could have some dystonic reaction or akathisia.  It's an, it's an urge to move related to the Geodon.  Something you could try is either divide, trying to divide the doses morning and evening just in case it's a peak effect somehow where your system metabolizes it.  Another thing we could do is try a slightly lower dose.  Now another thing that's sort of baffling the picture is the arthritic type symptoms.  Sorry about that.  Um, that makes me wonder about a potential infectious process too, you know, the risk of lyme disease in our area, strange symptoms of lyme disease including [INAUDIBLE] arthritis.  There's tooth pain believe it or not, sometimes facial droop, neurological symptoms.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have a lot of that.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a tough line.  That's good.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean it's—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Wouldn't I have to have a rash or something if I had lyme disease?
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes, but not always.
<b>PT:</b>	Well it's not, it's like here, you know.  It's like here and—
<b>DR:</b>	It's unusual—
<b>PT:</b>	And in the jaw, the upper jaw.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And I mean it, it must be tension because when I wake up in the morning, it's gone.  That's why I thought it can't be my teeth or else it'd be hurting all the time, the morning too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, these things wax and wean sometimes.  The first step would probably be trying to divide that Geodon dose just in case you're getting some kind of peak effect as it's metabolized along with the other medicines.  Then if there's not much really from that, we could see about gradually trying to lower it a bit.  Another option would be, um, if it like a muscle tightening effect, um, sometimes Cogentin helps with the side effects.  It helps relax the muscles.  It's almost like an anecdote for restlessness or muscle stiffness that can go with medicines like Geodon.
<b>PT:</b>	Really?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So that could be a possibility as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Is there anything that could stop it from happening?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Because, um, it's pretty miserable.  I tell my wife, you know, well I told her, you know, I'd rather, she won't let me stop the Provigil.  She knows, you know, I've been in car accidents and things like that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I don't think I was asleep in those accidents.
<b>DR:</b>	I think it's unlikely it's the Provigil really.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I mean after 2 weeks of being off it, it was still happening to me, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, right.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't think it could be the Provigil.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Geodon [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Geodon—
<b>DR:</b>	Lamictal—
<b>PT:</b>	Took years—
<b>DR:</b>	Could potentially be implicated.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, I just don't know how to relieve it.  I mean I've tried massage and, you know, ice and—
<b>DR:</b>	Let me take a look at some of the really obscure side effects of Lamictal because you also mentioned sores in your mouth.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I think that's from chewing, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, it's, I built up like scar tissue.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  But I have, I have another patient who developed some strange oral symptoms and, and with her, it looks like we've narrowed it down to the Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b>	Really?
<b>DR:</b>	So again, you know, people are very unique in terms of their responses to medication and I'll just see if there might be a clue there.
<b>PT:</b>	And no one mentions it to me.  I have one friend who mentioned it to me, you know, like what, what are you doing, you know.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Nobody else has said anything to me.
<b>DR:</b>	I've never noticed you do it here.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	But maybe later in the evening and maybe—
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe when I'm talking more, it's not as evident, but.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe.  Let me just see effects of other medications with Lamictal.  Arthralgias looks like it was happening—
<b>PT:</b>	What's that?
<b>DR:</b>	about like, um, aches, about 2% compared to placebo.  So that's not a high amount, but again it varies according to the person.  Rash or itching more common with Lamictal.
<b>PT:</b>	I had some itching, but I thought, I mean the doctor thought it was my neck, I mean my hands.  The top of my hands were like I was scratching constantly.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh.
<b>PT:</b>	I didn't have a rash or anything, but I thought that was, she thought it was because of my neck, the nerve, so.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have pets?
<b>PT:</b>	Pets?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, we have a cat.  I'm not allergic to her though.
<b>DR:</b>	To your knowledge, have you been bitten by a tick or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't go walking in the woods or I'm not outdoors.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  There is a cat associated disease called brucellosis, which actually can even be transmitted by saliva or scratch, um, and sometimes it can have very strange sort of waxing and waning symptoms, including itches, aching.  That's usually treated with an antibiotic.
<b>PT:</b>	No, the itching went away.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	With the whatyoumacallit?
<b>DR:</b>	The steroids.
<b>PT:</b>	The steroids.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Tooth disorder, 1% more with Lamictal than placebo, but that's sort of a weird tooth disorder.
<b>PT:</b>	Tooth disorder, what do they mean by that?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, good question.  Yeah, I'm not—
<b>PT:</b>	Disorder with the teeth or—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, let me just see if it says in any more detail.  Dry mouth can happen.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have that.
<b>DR:</b>	It looks like.  Let me just see.  The tooth disorder, that's odd.  That's the first time I've seen that.  Let's see, mouth ulceration infrequent.  Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	It's [INAUDIBLE] of all things.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, yeah, I mean you know, these things are reported for a reason.  Arthritis—
<b>PT:</b>	What about the Geodon?
<b>DR:</b>	Leg cramps, mycenia, twitching, bursitis, joint disorder, tendon contracture.
<b>PT:</b>	Tendons.
<b>DR:</b>	Hmm, muscle spasm, special symptoms.  Taste perversion.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	That could be like a metallic taste, something like that.
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think your instincts were, um, were reasonable.  I mean you were trying to look at what medication might or might not be aggravating it.  I think—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, my wife said the Provigil because it must have been since I was taking that at the time—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That I was taking so much of it, but I don't know.  I mean you, you weren't the one—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I think it's a reasonable dose.
<b>PT:</b>	You're the one who prescribed it, so.  I mean and I've been taking it for it must be a couple of years now.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you are, you were on it with [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	But I'm wondering about the Lamictal as a possibility too.  Hmm.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, maybe I should stop taking it then.
<b>DR:</b>	How much are you taking now?
<b>PT:</b>	Just the 1 little pill.  I don't know how much.
<b>DR:</b>	It's just a 25 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, okay.
<b>DR:</b>	What you could do is try cutting it in half for a week or so just to give yourself a chance because there's the opportunity to taper, let's taper.  Um, and then, um, see how you're feeling.
<b>PT:</b>	Stop it altogether?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but I'd go down to half for a week or so and see, you know, if you're feeling any difference.  Um, yeah, that's probably the first thing to just look at, you know, considering it's just the 25 mg, you know, taper that down.  We could see how things are going without.  If the problem still persists, we can look at dividing the Geodon and we could lower—
<b>PT:</b>	Could you look up Geodon and see if—
<b>DR:</b>	You bet, absolutely.  Sure enough.  Yeah because when you've been on these things for a while, now that you're taking other things, you know, for what's going on with, um—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not taking anything right now.
<b>DR:</b>	The musculoskeletal.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not taking anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Maybe a trial of Prednisone maybe or, you know, Solu—Medrol, maybe that could have affected the liver metabolism in such a way that, everybody's unique.
<b>PT:</b>	I've had it for longer than that.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, and again, even with the cat.  There could even be something infectious.  So, but at least in terms of if it could be something with these medications, we can at least try to in process of elimination.  Dry mouth can happen sometimes.  Let's see.  Swollen tongue.  I'm not hearing so much about that.  Some muscle aches again about the same rate as, um, Lamictal, about 2%.  Let me see the tooth disorder thing.  Gosh, tooth disorder 1% with, um, the Geodon as well, huh, at the lower doses.
<b>PT:</b>	So maybe it's tightened by a double dose.
<b>DR:</b>	I wonder, yeah.  Hmm.  Frequent muscle aches.  That's interesting.
<b>PT:</b>	It just grows on during the day because of the movement.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So I don't think it's like aching from the medication like because in the morning it doesn't ache.
<b>DR:</b>	You know what I mean.
<b>PT:</b>	And you think actually on awakening is when it's at its peak.
<b>DR:</b>	Something, something is making me move like that.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	If it's a tic or whatever you want to call it.  I don't know what it is, but.
<b>PT:</b>	I still Geodon is often one of the bigger culprits with that, but again, like I said, one of my patients with, um, Lamictal, she's not taking Geodon as well, had that issue.  Huh.  I'm not seeing a lot about mouth or teeth here.  Hmm.  How long ago did you develop the hypothyroid—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh years.
<b>PT:</b>	Condition.  Many years ago?
<b>DR:</b>	Years, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been taking it what's it called for years.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	At the same dosage.
<b>DR:</b>	Because sometimes they say that, um, Geodon can be implicated with that, but the dystonia, twitching, they have that down as potentially frequent.
<b>PT:</b>	Would that be a twitch what I'm [INAUDIBLE]?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And then trismus, that is jaw tightening.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, well that, I mean that could be.
<b>DR:</b>	Huh, yeah.  If it doesn't affect your sleep, it's still couldn't hurt to divide that Geodon dose.  You're still taking the, you know, main amount during the day.  I'll write for some Cogentin.  You can take that, you know, if you feel muscle kind of thing happening, and if that works, then we might be on to something.  It's like a backup.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, and we can still see about whether the Lamictal is really something that needs to be in the picture.  Now that you've had this, you know, quite a period now on the Cymbalta where it is.  You've got the Provigil back in place.
<b>PT:</b>	So I should still split the Lamictal and, and split the Geodon—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Into two, two doses.
<b>DR:</b>	You could, yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And take that other stuff.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Cogentin.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that could be on an as needed basis if you like and if you find, you know—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm going to need it every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I have this every day.  I'm not, I'm not, I don't get a vacation from this.
<b>DR:</b>	No, that's got to be really aggravating.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right, with the Cogentin, would you prefer to have smaller doses to work with and be able to take that a couple of times a day?  Would you rather have the 1 mg dose that you can divide and get the prescription to last longer?
<b>PT:</b>	Um, well is that something that could be prescribed for 90 days?
<b>DR:</b>	That's not one.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	And it's pretty inexpensive too.  It's generic.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I have a prescription plan, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I know there's something.  I don't know if they do, maybe they do Ativan 90 days.
<b>DR:</b>	Sometimes they'll send you 30 days at a time on the benzodiazepines, but benztropine, Cogentin doesn't have that restriction.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I, I want it so when I take it, I want it to work.  I don't want to [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	I'll do the 1 mg.  Yeah, and if for some reason, you can take it twice a day if needed.  Um, you know, if for some reason that seems like, you know, it's making you sleepy or a little lightheaded, you could cut it in half, but I don't think you'd want to cut the .5's in half.  So, and Cogentin does come as strong as 2, so if you, if we ever need to go up to the 2 we can.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	But I probably could tell from the one whether it's working or not.
<b>DR:</b>	Most likely.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I need other medications.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Sure, which other ones do you need because I know you send in for the 90 days?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, if you could just give me a blank with no date on it.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I, like I have, I just ordered the last refill.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Yeah, and, um—
<b>PT:</b>	Lunesta.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure.  And the Lunesta, that's 3 mg, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Um.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm pretty sure.  I'll double check.
<b>PT:</b>	No, it's not, Lunesta, Rozerem.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, the Rozerem.
<b>PT:</b>	Rozerem 8.  Yeah, I get them mixed.  I, I took the Lunesta before.
<b>DR:</b>	I have something—
<b>PT:</b>	This doesn't make me very sleepy.  You know, I didn't even know if I need it actually.
<b>DR:</b>	You know what, there is a fantastic giveaway with Rozerem.  It's a survey, takes about 5 minutes online.  You answer the questions, go back after 2 weeks, answer again and they send you this incredible sleep machine.  It's really great.  It, um, it has the temperature.  It's a clock.  You can choose, um, all these different sounds like a babbling brook, like—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	A forest.  It's actually pretty nifty.  If you ordered it from Brookstone, I think it would cost around $100 or so.
<b>PT:</b>	And they give it to you for free?
<b>DR:</b>	They will if you tried Rozerem and you answer some questions about Rozerem.  Yeah, that's right Lunesta was a while back.  Okay, so you need the Cogentin, the Rozerem—
<b>PT:</b>	Lamictal.
<b>DR:</b>	Milligram.  All right let me do the Lamictal just in case we stay with that.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, the Cymbalta 60 mg.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I don't know if you want me to go to my other doctor for the Synthroid because I'm going to need that too.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I can do the Synthroid.  Um, I wrote for the Cymbalta 60 and 30 for 90 day with 3 refills back in, um, in July.  Do you know if they'll keep that on file or?
<b>PT:</b>	In July.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I wrote Provigil.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think I need them already?
<b>DR:</b>	Cymbalta two strengths and lorazepam, 90 days on each of those with 3 refills back in July.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe I did.  Maybe I, I misplaced them—
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Or something.  I'm okay with the 30's, but the 60's are going to run out.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean I'm getting another, I mean do you want me to ask you for it next time or something because—
<b>DR:</b>	I think I may have some samples too I could give you.
<b>PT:</b>	Well I have enough for a while and they're sending me, they're sending me the last refill, but then I can't refill it after that.
<b>DR:</b>	Either way.
<b>PT:</b>	So I mean I'll, I'll have it for another 90 days.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	After they send it to me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it could go either way.  You definitely need though the Cogentin, the Rozerem and the Lamictal, right, for 90 day do you think?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	The same, the same thing and the Cymbalta 60.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And the Synthroid is .05 mg.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay, Cymbalta 60, right?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right.  And those need to be on separate prescriptions, right, the other ones?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, they're all on separate—
<b>DR:</b>	You're okay for now?
<b>PT:</b>	Prescriptions.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I don't trust this company.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I know.  It's probably easier if they could just put them each [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	I can't even put more than one prescription in an envelope because I'm afraid that they'll stick together because I've heard that they've lost them.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	So I stick one in each envelope.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, it's understandable.  I hope it's postage paid.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I don't care.  I would pay the 42 cents anyway—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Just to—
<b>DR:</b>	But still, yeah.  One of these days they'll let us do all this online.  Shall I leave them undated?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  One milligram tabs.  Yeah, you'll like the sleep machine.  It is really neat.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I, I, I forgot all about that kind of thing because I, I had tinnitus for a while.
<b>DR:</b>	You did?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	When did that take place?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, well I had it maybe about a year and a half, 2 years ago.  It sort of went away because I took this, I guess you could call it a homeopathic remedy.
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	Called Ring Stop.
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	And I took a couple of bottles of that over a span of time and, um, it went away.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I was, talk about maddening.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	That ringing in your ears just, so when I went to the, um, National Tinnitus Society or whatever it is in [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's in, on [DEIDENTIFIED] actually.
<b>DR:</b>	No kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	Um, this big machine with ocean sounds and, and also a full time machine.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You have with earplugs or something like batters.  I used to walk around with, uh, my walkman on static.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, just so if I, I wouldn't have to hear it.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	But the Ring Stop works.  My wife didn't like it because it gives you terrible breath, but I didn't care.
<b>DR:</b>	What's it, what's it composed of?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, a lot of things.  You know, it could be snake oils.  I don't know what's in it.
<b>DR:</b>	Hey, if it worked, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	There's always something to these.  They work for somebody, you know.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but not everybody.
<b>DR:</b>	That is worth a try.  That's fascinating.
<b>PT:</b>	But this jaw thing is almost as bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I think we've got a couple of things to try to narrow in on and I'll find some more information about that, um, brucellosis as well because I was really surprised at how pervasive that can be.
<b>PT:</b>	What is that again?
<b>DR:</b>	It used to be called cat scratch disease.
<b>PT:</b>	My cat doesn't have any front claws.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, but even from the saliva, you can get it which surprised me.
<b>PT:</b>	And she does lick me.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It's interesting.  I sometimes wonder if, you know, with sort of generalized global warming, which I do believe is going on, although I'm not necessarily saying, you know, people caused it exclusively.  The earth had trends like this before.  I sometimes wonder if some of the bugs aren't a little more active or something in a slightly different climate.
<b>PT:</b>	I think they're, they're multiplying at different times of the year.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I had a student who, uh, was, I guess his mother developed that disease from kitty litter.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, toxoplasmosis.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's what he had.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So it's affected his vision and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.
<b>PT:</b>	He's retarded to a certain, mildly retarded.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh wow.  So it was during the pregnancy she had that?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah it [INAUDIBLE].  Yeah.  That's the only place I've ever seen it is on kids that I have had.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I've actually never had a kid with—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Congenital toxoplasmosis.  I know people who have gotten it later in life from undercooked meat—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh really?
<b>DR:</b>	And so forth because that can happen as well.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh God.
<b>DR:</b>	Um, all right.  Well I think this completes that batch of prescriptions anyway for now, and we can set up a followup appointment.  What works well for your timetable, maybe a month or so or 6 weeks—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	With school back in session.
<b>PT:</b>	Let me look.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	If we can do it a little earlier because the rush hour.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, sure.
<b>PT:</b>	Coming and going.
<b>DR:</b>	Definitely.  We'll find another time.  So, let's see, would you like to aim for 5:00, [DATE]?  Six weeks, that's too late.  Let's see, when do you finish?
<b>PT:</b>	When I want to.
<b>DR:</b>	[LAUGHING].  Would you want to meet as early as 3:00 or we could also do 4:00?
<b>PT:</b>	Three is better.
<b>DR:</b>	Three is good.  How about 3:00 Tuesday October, or actually 3:30, [DATE]?
<b>PT:</b>	That's not, that's a long time away, isn't it?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  The other, I could do 3:00 actually, if you can come as early as 3:00.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I can.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I have someone coming at 2:30, that's the tough thing.  I could probably do 3:30 on—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, with the new prescription, I'd probably want to see you, you know, sooner.
<b>DR:</b>	Sure, yeah.  I actually think we could do [DATE], 3:30 [DATE], how's that?
<b>PT:</b>	That's [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b>	Shoot, that's right because I'm covering [NAME OTHER] the Wednesday.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  How about the week after?
<b>DR:</b>	Let me see, the week after [DATE].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Let's see, 3:30 is good.
<b>PT:</b>	Three thirty.
<b>DR:</b>	Three thirty.  Great.  All right, would you like a card with that?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I'll just write it in my book.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, 3:30 [DATE].  Great.  You're so virtuous.  You have exact change and everything?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Thank you so much.
<b>PT:</b>	Of course $5 because it's you and the cleaning lady.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, that's so great.  [LAUGHING].  Oh, that's great.  Thank you very much.  Cash, all right.  Well, I'd like to wish you a very peaceful holiday.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, thank you.
<b>DR:</b>	And I think some of these medication adjustments might—
<b>PT:</b>	I hope so.
<b>DR:</b>	Might help and thanks for participating in the study too.  You may get a followup call from them, yeah.  And if other opportunities come up, I'll definitely let you know.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.  And I would have done this other thing.  It's just—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sorry the timing was—
<b>PT:</b>	Now why don't they do it on the weekend or in the evening.
<b>DR:</b>	I know and people work.  I mean they're weren't articulate, high functioning people.  They're probably working, you know, and they're probably back to work after the Labor Day holiday.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I don't understand it because my daughter probably would have done it too.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	You know.
<b>DR:</b>	But the timing was tough.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well I'll keep you posted.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	A lot of them do take place in the evenings and such, so yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	All right.
<b>DR:</b>	Have a nice day.  Drive safely.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And very peaceful holiday to you and your family.
<b>PT:</b>	Thanks a lot.
<b>DR:</b>	Take care.
<b>PT:</b>	Bye.
<b>DR:</b>	Bye bye.
