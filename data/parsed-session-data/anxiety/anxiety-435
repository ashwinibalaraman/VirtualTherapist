DURING dinner I sat by myself, Sue gone, Beth
gone and Elise taken home by her husband a few days before. I
picked at the chicken hash and string beans, then gave up even
the pretense of eating. I stared hopelessly out of the window,
waiting for the rest to finish so I could go back to my room
where I had to face nobody. I was still feeling ashamed of my
empty boasts about moving.


As I gazed through the bars out over the fields that surrounded
Lanier, it suddenly struck me how easy it would be to
escape. I studied the deserted terrain, knowing only one guard
patrolled it. An image of myself flashed into mind, fleeing
through the fields and plunging into the nearby woods. I would
wear a dress over a pair of shorts, then discard the dress to
confuse the searchers. I would also carry a scarf so I could hide
my blond hair.


The more I thought of the possibility of escape, the more
excited I became. I tried to calm down by dismissing the idea as
fantasy. To run away from Lanier would be real and dangerous.


But by the time we returned to our rooms, I was moving by
instinct alone. My mind had congealed like a big, ugly mold. I
was no longer attempting to reason, to stop myself. I opened the
closet and studied each dress, calculating which would be the
darkest and thus blend best into the twilight shade in the
woods. Which looked the least conspicuous in cut and design?

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I selected the black cotton splashed with yellow flowers, a new
dress sent by my mother. I had worn it for my first meeting with
Dr. Anders, thinking it made me look sophisticated. Discarding
it along with him seemed quite appropriate. I slipped the dress
over a pair of shorts, then put on socks and tennis shoes.


I was picking out a scarf when a knock sounded. "Yes?" I
called out anxiously.


"May I come in? It's Miss Fitzgerald."


"Come on in." I tried to keep my voice calm.


The head nurse opened the door. "I thought I'd visit with
you before I go off duty."


"By all means. Won't you sit down?" Did she suspect anything?
She often came to my room at night for a few minutes'
chat, but now it seemed more than just a casual visit. I carefully
watched her expression as she looked at my feet. She must know
I only wore those shoes to the tennis court.


I tried to make conversation, seeking frantically for innocuous
topics. Then I asked what was really on my mind.
"Why wasn't I sent to the open hall, Miss Fitzgerald, as Dr.
Anders promised?"


"I really don't know, Mrs. Rhodes. The doctors don't discuss
their decisions with us. I imagine you were not moved because
of your mood swings lately."


"But my moods are part of me," I protested. "Surely they
aren't going to keep me locked up until I don't have a mood. I'll
be here until I die, at that rate."


"You know that isn't true." She smiled. "I think you'll probably
be transferred just before you're ready for discharge."


Just before discharge! Why, that could be a whole year. It was
fantastic. I most certainly would not wait to contribute to Dr.
Anders' comfort. Now, more than ever, I was determined to
leave Lanier. Miss Fitzgerald couldn't have done a better job if
she tried, to convince me to flee.


I wanted to confide my plan, for I felt she liked me, but I

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For Miss Fitzgerald's eyes, I tried to look unconcerned. "Well,
if that's the case, I better get used to the routine here."


"You're very good about the hall program, Mrs. Rhodes. I
know it must be difficult for you to go along with a lot of the
inconveniences. I appreciate the way you tolerate what must
seem a monotonous routine." She meant the locking and unlocking
of doors which reminded me with every turn of the key,
"Prisoner! Prisoner!"


"Thanks for the flattery. It's really not so hard to live on this
hall." I hoped my voice veiled my deceit.


"Good night and sleep well." She stood up and I opened the
door for her. "See you later," and she was off.


As she walked up the hall, I watched her slim figure recede
and thought, If you do see me later, old gal, it's not going to be
through any fault of mine, even though I do like you.


I belted the black dress tightly, tucking a blue sweater
through the patent leather belt. This would allow my arms to
swing free as I ran. Clothing preparations complete, I sought
out Jane, a woman who had been at Lanier for almost a year.


"Tell me, Jane, what's below the hill that lies back of the
fence?"


"There's a creek that runs through the meadow. Why? You
aren't going to try to escape, are you?" She sounded incredulous.
"No one has ever gotten away from a locked hall."


"Heavens, no! I'd be the last person in the hospital to try
anything so foolish. I was just interested in the topography of
our surroundings."


"Oh." Jane smiled as she took my hand. "I'd miss you if you
ran away. You're a darling."


"First call to the lawn, ladies." The attendant's announcement

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Come on, Jane. Let's go outside." My mouth was dry, my
legs felt ready to buckle under me any moment. Why didn't
these stupid women hurry into line? We weren't supposed to
equal the precision of the Radio City Rockettes but we were
expected to respond promptly to requests by nurses and attendants
to herd together so we could all move. At last the nurse
said, "All right, ladies. Let's go."


It was about an hour before twilight and the lawn was dotted
with small groups of patients who sat in twos and threes, talking.
A few were off by themselves, reading or writing letters.
With a pang, I recognized a few of my friends, now moved to
the open hall. I was embarrassed, for I didn't want them to
watch my flight.


The guard was nowhere in sight. That was one break. I could
hear the ball being hit back and forth on the tennis court and
wondered who was playing. From where I stood at the top of a
slight incline, I could see the baseball field filled with spectators,
the road around it lined with cars. All the better. The
more people, the more confusion would be created. I watched
my hallmates pick out chairs and arrange them in a circle. They
sat down and prepared for a half hour of relaxation. Packs of
cigarettes were opened, letters pulled out of purses, book marks
removed from last year's best-sellers, borrowed from the library.
Two student nurses stood surveying the placid scene with arms
akimbo, as they say.


"Can I have a light, please?" asked a patient.


The nurses fumbled in their pockets. Apparently neither had
brought a box of matches. "Just a minute. I'll run into the office
and get some," offered one.


She walked off toward the main building. It couldn't have
been planned better in my behalf. The group was left with one
nurse. I knew she would not forsake the other women to chase
me. Besides she was stocky and moved awkwardly. Next to her I
looked like an Olympic star.

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This was the moment to start running. Yet, for a brief second
I stood paralyzed, unable to move a muscle even as I knew I was
about to flee. In my mind's eye, I saw my figure dashing across
the lawn and felt momentary shame. Then I picked my skirt up
above my knees and headed as fast as I could toward the mob on
the ball field. I skimmed over the macadam road that divided
the lawn in two, and as the substance underfoot changed, almost
fell, but half-stumbling managed to regain my balance, hit the
turf again and picked up speed.


"Hey, where are you going?" a patient shouted at me.


"For a short evening constitutional," I yelled over my shoulder,
thinking how funny that would sound when they quoted it
later. I wanted to stop and laugh myself.


Seconds later I reached the wooden fence that bordered
Lanier. I heard someone on the tennis court scream, "Laura,
come back! Don't do this!" I knew it was Sue. Poor Sue. I didn't
have time to tell her my plans but anyhow she might have
reported me, believing it for my own good.


I was looking for the best place to vault the fence when I
heard one of the men patients shout, "Run, lady, run!" I
thought he was warning me someone was in pursuit and, lungs
bursting and belly constricting with cramps, I climbed the
wooden fence without taking time to find the easiest spot. My
sweater and dress got caught in a couple of places and I pulled
frantically, ripping away at both.


Afraid to waste a second looking back to see if pursuers were
gaining, I hurtled over the fence and into the woods. I skirted
them, not daring to enter too deeply, for I was suddenly struck
by the fear that the lengthening shadows held a man ready to
jump out and rape or kill me. I had always been frightened to
death of thick woods, would never go near them alone.


Down a hill, and there was the creek Jane had mentioned. As
I reached it, I slowed up and looked back. No one was in sight
nor could I hear a sound except my own gasping. I plunged into
the shallow water, hoping to catch my breath by slowing my
pace to a fast walk. I had to stop dead for a moment to hold my

[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Quickly I unzipped my dress and stepped out of it while in
the water. Then I put on the sweater. I tried to pull up water-soaked
socks under tennis shoes that squished with every step. I
was too nervous to tie my scarf around my hair.


I noticed my tracks in the sand of the creek were not washing
away and I began to run again. Aching legs and air-starved lungs
protested every painful step. Small pebbles bounded up against
my legs, stinging them. I stumbled over and over but kept
moving. How far behind were my pursuers? I did not dare stop
and look again.


Suddenly I saw a road. I crossed the creek, stepped out of it
and scrambled up the bank. A barbed-wire fence separated it
from the road. I climbed over, gashing myself in several places.
As soon as I reached the road, I put up my thumb to hitch a ride
from passing cars.


The first driver did not even slow down. The next car came
to a full stop. A rather gaunt young man was at the wheel and
beside him a buxom, redheaded woman held a white French
poodle. She rolled down the window.


"Can you give me a lift?" I tried to keep my voice from shaking.
I did not want them to think I had been running like a
madwoman. "My car broke down and if you could give me a
ride to the nearest filling station, I'd sure appreciate it." I had
just breath enough to get this all out.


The driver leaned across the front seat. "Come in." He
opened the door and I climbed in, sitting next to the woman. As
the car started to roll, I glanced at my feet. My wet and muddy
legs were crisscrossed with bloody gashes. I had been aware of
no pain and wondered how I could have been so badly cut on
the barbed wire without feeling it. I tried to brush off some of
the mud and push my socks up over a few of the cuts. I hoped
the young couple were not too observant.


"Where did you leave your car?" the driver asked.

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"About a quarter of a mile from here. I was trying to hike
across the fields to save distance. I fell in the creek back there."
I managed a nervous laugh. "Thank you for stopping to pick
me up. I must look a sight."


The man kept his eyes on the road.


"Your dog is adorable." I tried to interest the woman. "Did
you get him in the city?"


"Yes." She stroked the white poodle's ears.


"You didn't get him from Tom Blake, by any chance, did
you?"


"Why, yes," said the man in surprise. "We did."


"I used to work for him vacations because I loved dogs so."


"You're kidding! What's your name?"


The car had circled the road which surrounded Lanier and
we were just passing the entrance to the hospital as the driver
asked my name. I held my breath. I was afraid he had seen
through my ruse and would drive straight into the grounds of
Lanier. But the car kept its course toward the city. I ducked my
head under the dashboard, pretending to pick something off my
shoe. I did not want the guard in the little entrance house to
catch a glimpse of me.


"My name is Laura Daniels." I used my maiden name.
"Maybe you know my father, John Daniels."


"Who doesn't?" the man said proudly. "One of our leading
lights. Wasn't he chairman of the city's hospital campaign last
year?"


I nodded my head. Daddy had been everything at one time or
another. Name something <i>pro bono publico</i> and he would have
had his hand in it.


"I think I remember you, too, when you were working with
Tom," the man said. "Didn't you show the miniature poodles?"


"That was me." I added, not in jest, "In my better days."


"What a small world!" The man shook his head in wonder.
Then he asked worriedly, "Say, Laura, are you sure you're all
right? I mean, no one tried to get fresh with you?"

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I laughed in relief. So he had the rape fantasy, too, rather
than figuring I was a fugitive from an insane asylum. "No one
tried to get fresh with me. I know I look as if I were running
away from rape. I <i>was</i> scared, racing through those woods. You
know how the evening light throws shadows everywhere that
look like monsters. I kept imagining I saw strange men hiding
behind trees. Sorry. No tragic tale to relate. It was all in my
vivid imagination."


As I said these words, I suddenly felt as though I had turned
to stone. My eyes fell to the bloody gashes on my feet. But where
was the cotton, I thought? They always wrap cotton around
bloody wounds to protect them. What happened to the cotton
bandages?


The driver was saying, "Just wanted to make sure. These are
lonely roads. I don't think there are even any filling stations
around here."


I had a sudden inspiration. "If I can head as far into Philadelphia
as you go, I will stop off at a friend's house on this street.
From there, I can call my father and he will pick me up. I left
the keys to my car under the dashboard and he will get in touch
with road service and have them bring in the car." I thought I
was very clever to invent realistic details.


"Okay. By the way, what happened to the car?" He didn't
sound suspicious, just curious.


"The usual." I had to think fast. What <i>was</i> the usual? "I
stopped for two seconds and the motor wouldn't turn over
again. I guess it got overheated."


I now recognized familiar landmarks. We were nearing Fran's
apartment. I had not stopped to think what she would say if I
appeared on her doorstep without warning. I wondered if she
knew where I had lived for the past two months. I had not been
in touch with her since I wrote from Chicago shortly after we
moved there.


"I can get off at the next corner," I said. "That will leave me
right in front of the apartment."

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the car stopped, I opened the door and backed out. I
noticed a wet spot imprinted where I had been sitting and felt
ashamed.


"Thank you for the lift. I really can't thank you enough." I
was more grateful than they could ever imagine. "And I'm sorry
about being such a mess."


I slammed the door, waved, then ran into the building. Fran
and her mother lived in a basement apartment, and I half
stumbled, half walked down the flight of steps. I prayed Fran
would be home as I pounded on the front door. It was opened
almost immediately by her short, slim mother over whom Fran
towered by at least a foot.


"Laura," she said warmly, holding out her arms. "How good
to see you!"


I almost knocked the slight woman over in my haste to rush
inside and shut the door against possible pursuers. I felt secure
for the first time in hours as I heard the door close behind me.


"I was hoping somebody would be home," I said. Fran was
not too popular and I didn't think she would be out on a weekday
night. I noticed Mrs. Barker was wearing a housecoat and
slippers and obviously had been cooking, for an apron was tied
around her waist. "I'm sorry if I interrupted your dinner," I
apologized.


"Not at all, dear. Sit down and eat with us. We were just
about to start."


Fran ran into the room. "Laura!" she exclaimed, throwing a
quick look at my mottled garb and bloody legs. "Where did you
come from? What a surprise."


"The creature from the lost lagoon," I quipped. "I'll explain
all if I can only take off these muddy things before I ruin your
furniture. Do you have something I can slip into?"


"Sure. Wait a minute." She went into her bedroom.


I felt uncomfortable although I had been in this homey room
many times. It did not feel familiar now. I was being hunted
and had to beg Fran and her mother for protection, yet I didn't

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Fran returned with a pair of shorts and a shirt. "Here. Try
these on."


I stripped in the bathroom. My clothes were caked with filth.
The tennis shoes hung heavy with water. I hated Lanier for
making me into a muddy, melancholy fugitive. I wondered if
Fran would ever again think of me as the poised, sophisticated
friend she once knew.


"They fit fine. Thanks a lot," I said. Fran and her mother
stood in the doorway, anxiously watching me change.


"They're too small for me," Fran said enviously. "How did
you lose so much weight, Laura?"


"Pal, if you had the exercise I've had today, you'd be thinner,
too." I stepped toward them. "Let's go into the living room and
I'll tell you the sad story."


We sat down and looked at each other. I asked, "Do you know
where I have been for the past couple of months?"


Daughter and mother exchanged glances. Then the mother
said, "We found out this week."


"How very well-timed!" I said sarcastically. "Then you know
I've been hospitalized since the beginning of June. I may have
needed it at first. I'm all right now. But the hospital won't let
me go. Although I went in voluntarily, they tried to commit me
when I wrote a three-day notice saying I wanted to leave. So that
avenue of escape is out. Niles and I aren't getting along too well.
I can't risk being committed because if we decide to get a divorce,
the courts would undoubtedly award him custody of
Kathy, with my record showing I had been committed to an
insane asylum."


They were listening intently. "The horror of it all is that I
am <i>not</i> crazy," I said. "You do believe me, don't you? In a moment
of depression, I took a few too many sleeping pills. That's
absolutely all it was."


As I tried to convince them, I thought these two had every

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"To tell you the truth, I haven't really thought that far ahead.
I ran away so fast, and the trip was so frightening, that I haven't
got my bearings yet."


"How did you manage to escape?" Fran's eyes were wide with
wonder.


I told them of my flight from Lanier. Fran laughed. "I'd love
to know what happened to those two student nurses assigned to
your group."


"How about some food, Laura?" Mrs. Barker asked.


"No, thanks. I had dinner before I left so precipitously." I
sighed. "I guess the only thing to do is to notify my parents. Do
you think you could call them for me, Mrs. Barker?"


"Certainly." She started for her bedroom where the telephone
was located.


"Please ask them to come right over. Alone. Don't tell them
why. And don't call anyone else, please."


I was afraid if I phoned, they would call the hospital. I was
even afraid Mrs. Barker might phone Lanier. If she did, I
would run into the kitchen, grab a knife and threaten to stab
myself, should anyone appear to take me back.


It seemed only a minute before she returned. "Your mother
and father are on the way over, Laura. I cautioned them to come
alone. And I didn't tell them why, although I think they have a
good idea."


They wouldn't be my parents if they couldn't make a good
guess. "Thank you," I said to Mrs. Barker. "I'll always be grateful
to you." I meant it from the bottom of my uncertain heart.
This was my day to have strangers show gentleness toward me. I
hoped my parents would do as well.


"We're glad you thought enough of us as friends to trust us."
She smiled.

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Not only did I think enough of you," I said, "but you were
the closest to the hospital." All three of us laughed merrily.


"What will you do after your parents get here?" Fran asked.


"I'm not quite sure. I'll try to make them understand why
I want to leave Lanier and hope they'll help. For the same
amount of money I spend each day in the hospital, I could see a
psychiatrist five days a week on the outside. And one who--"


Fran interrupted. "I think I hear a car stopping."


A few seconds later, heavy footfalls sounded on the steps,
accompanied by the quick tapping of high heels. We heard the
knocker on the front door being raised.


"I'll let them in," Fran offered.


My heart was pounding as fast as when I took off from Lanier.
What if my mother and father would not listen to me? Maybe
they were standing outside fortified with police. Or attendants
from Lanier. I felt hunted once again. I wanted to hide in the
bathroom as Fran opened the hall door. I could hear my parents'
voices and Fran's hurried greetings.


Then they were in the room staring at me. What should I say?
Should I kiss them? I stood stiffly with my arms rigid at my sides.


"Thank you for coming so promptly," I said quietly. It
seemed I had been saying nothing but "thank you" in the past
hour. "I was afraid the hospital would notify you before I had a
chance to talk to you. Have they called?"


"No one called except Mrs. Barker," said my mother, looking
bewildered. "We got in the car and drove right over."


"Did you tell anyone where you were going?" I used my most
threatening third-degree voice.


"No. Mrs. Barker told us not to."


"Good. How about sitting down?"


The two of them, looking frightened, obeyed me. I felt
hopeless. These were the same parents I had encountered at
Lanier. Why did I always expect them to change? They were
helpless. What strength could they give me? Nonetheless, I had
to try them. I had nothing else. Had I found Fran alone, I
might have borrowed enough money to buy clothes and run

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I leaned forward, gazing earnestly at this couple before me, so
often enemies rather than beloved parents. If words counted,
this was the time to find the telling ones.


"I have just been through hell," I started off. "My arms and
legs are ripped and gashed. That's from barbed wire. I don't
feel any pain, though. What does hurt, and hurts so much I
don't think I will ever forget it, is the picture I shall always
carry of myself running like a maniac through the woods and
into the creek. I'll never forget the feeling of being chased and
trying to outwit my pursuers. My lungs felt like exploding
because I couldn't stop to breathe, and the woods grew darker
and darker and I had to rely on trees to hide me, knowing the
forest was my only hope and at the same time fearing it might
be concealing an even worse threat."


My voice rose in a terror I could not conceal. "I fled into those
woods like a convict, even as I thought there might be someone
there who would kill me--a rapist or a murderer. I had been so
anxious to get away, I hadn't even thought of this possibility.
Can you imagine my panic? Does my appearance and my efforts
to escape give you any clue to my desperation?"


Mother started to weep. I felt like striking her and telling her
to shut up. If anyone had the right to tears, it was I.


"I want to go home," I said. "I'm no crazier than either of
you. That's not saying much, I know, but you are not caged. I'll
see a psychiatrist every day, if you like. I'm not depressed anymore
and I'm not suicidal. I don't need to be shut away."


Then I asked in a more quiet tone, "By the way, where is
Niles?"


"He's home," said my father dully, the first words he had
spoken.


"Does he know where you are?"


"No. Mrs. Barker told us to speak to no one. We got up from
the dinner table and left him without saying a word."

[p. <i>173</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Bravo!" I let him have it with irony. "And now what are you
going to do?"


"What would you like us to do?" This was Mother, in her soft
singer's voice.


"First of all, take me home. I want to talk to Niles. And see
Kathy. Just <i>don't</i> call the hospital." I put all the pleading of
which I was capable into my voice.


"We're going to have to tell them, Laura," said my father.


I stared at him in hatred. "Can't you even wait until they call
<i>you?</i> Don't you feel any compassion for me?"


His head drooped between his shoulders. He clasped his
hands and stared at them. Dear God, I thought, at least he
didn't have time to pick up those damned dark glasses and I
know what he feels.


"Fran, thanks a lot." I kissed her cheek. And to her mother,
"I can't tell you what your taking me in has meant. I'm sorry I
had to put you in the middle." I kissed her, too.


I started for the door. Fran walked on one side and my father
flanked me on the other. I wanted to cry. I had stood many
times with Fran beside me as a friend but now I felt they were
both watching me suspiciously and if I moved in an attempt to
run away, one of them would seize me. They were not my father
and my friend, they were guards. Maybe I really <i>was</i> insane and
belonged at Lanier. Could I have lost my mind without knowing
it? Was Dr. Anders right in delaying my transfer to the open
hall?


I took Fran's hand. "They might be waiting for me outside
that door, Fran. I can't even trust my parents. I'm afraid to
leave. What will I do if they take me back?"


"We did not call the hospital, Laura," said my father. "Please,
let's go."


As we approached the car, I saw no one standing near and felt
relieved. Father unlocked the door and I slid inside. Mother
quickly slipped in next to me. I still didn't trust them not to
drive me back to Lanier. As my father turned the key in the

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No." My mother answered for him. "We're taking you
home."


"I'm sorry to keep asking," I muttered. "You don't know how
frightened I feel."


By this time the car was traveling steadily westward, away
from Lanier. I recognized streets over which I had driven many
times, always taking them for granted. The fleeting scenery
looked strange now, as in a nightmare. It did not seem to belong
to any part of my life. Or was it that I did not belong in it, that I
had never seen the streets and houses as they were but only
through fantasy-ridden eyes?


"I think I can do all right on the outside," I assured my
parents. "I hope you understand that. My psychiatrist is young
and not too well trained as yet. He doesn't know me at all. He
acts like an idiot. The first time I met him, he asked if I were
giving him a line. The next time, he accused me of being glib.
When I finally proved I could restrain the impulse to hurt
myself and told him so, do you know what that bonehead did?
He took away what few privileges I had. He also promised to
move me to the open hall and then reneged."


"Maybe Dr. Chandler would assign you another psychiatrist,"
suggested my father.


"No," I said emphatically. "I don't want anyone at Lanier. I
don't want to go back."


I addressed my mother. "Please make Daddy understand. He
is such a rotten father at times. I know it, and he knows it, even
though I love him and he knows that, too. Why should I have to
belabor this Lanier business? It's water under the bridge and I
want to go on living, not trying to die."


My mother looked out of the window. Then she said softly,
"Let's see what Dr. Chandler says."


"Oh, Mother!" I wailed. "Are we back to that? I might as well
have stayed at the hospital for all the good this has done me.
Why did I ever call you two anyway?" I wanted to cry out in

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The car spun into our driveway. I stared at the huge house
where I had spent so many unhappy-happy years. The sun was
just lowering itself over the horizon and there was scarcely
enough light to see the shape of my castle of childhood clearly.


Dad drove the car into the rear. As I stepped out, I saw Niles
running down the walk toward me. I broke away from my
parents and rushed into his arms. Then quickly backed off.


"How did you know--"


He interrupted. "Fran called and said you were on the way."


"Are there any cars in front of the house?" My voice was
hushed, that of a conspirator.


"The street is filled with them," he teased.


"Oh, Niles!" I threw my arms around him. "Don't let them
take me away until you hear me out. Please!"


With one hand clasping my shoulder, he led me toward the
kitchen. Toby barked at me as though I were a stranger.


"Stupid animal," I scolded. "He doesn't know me." I felt like
kicking his glossy red hide.


Once inside the house, I said, "Let's go upstairs so I can see
Kathy."


"She's asleep, but you can take a look at her."


I stiffened, resenting his attitude. I could take a look at <i>my</i>
baby, with his permission, he was saying. I had produced our
daughter and if anyone was going to accede graciously that the
child could be seen, it should be me.


"Which room is she in?" I asked with all the dignity I could
muster.


"The large guest room."


I took our brown-carpeted stairs two at a time and gently
opened the door of the best guest room. Kathy was lying asleep
in a crib between the twin beds. I stood and looked at her
longingly. She had grown so big I hardly recognized her. She
had perfectly formed little features. Her tiny body curled

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Wake her," said my mother, who had followed me upstairs.
"It's not every day Kathy gets to see her mother."


"Oh, no," I protested. "She's sleeping so peacefully."


"She'll be awake soon, anyhow. Go ahead, Laura. Pick her
up."


I bent over, lifted up my baby and cradled her in my arms.
She opened her eyes and blinked at me. I was afraid she might
cry, since I was almost a stranger, but she only looked at me
groggily. Then her eyes widened as she came out of sleep.


"I'm sorry to wake you, Kathy," I said softly, "but these
people may take me away soon and I really did want to see you
before I landed back in jail."


I sat down with her in the pink satin chair, reserved for the
elegant bottoms of my father's important guests. At least mine
was dry now, thanks to Fran's generosity.


I propped Kathy up against my bent legs and smiled at her.
Her face flooded with a blissful grin. I realized I had never seen
my child smile. I felt a deep flood of warmth for the daughter I
had deserted out of my own terror.


"Yes, little girl," I said, "it really is pretty funny, isn't it? Your
crazy mother coming home to hold you. Don't worry. I won't
hurt you."


She looked quizzically at me. I hugged her tightly. "I made
you some beautiful slippers for your feet, but they lost them on
me. I'll make you another pair as soon as I buy some knitting
needles and wool."


Then I looked at Mother. "Has the hospital called?" I held
my baby tight against my breast.


"Yes, they have," Mother said quietly. "Dr. Chandler left a
message with Niles that we are to bring you back as soon as you
are ready."


Niles and my father joined us. I stared at Daddy as he sat
dejectedly on the bed. Then at Mother. At that moment I hated
her for being such a pathetic creature, of no use to me at all. I
turned to Niles. Then back to Daddy.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"And so all of you are going to make me return just because
Dr. Chandler says so," I challenged them. "Well, that's just
great! I almost get myself killed to escape, and you deliver me
right back into the enemy's hands."


My voice rose as I spit out the final insult, one I had the
feeling my parents had often hurled at me as a baby. "You both
stink!"


"Laura," my mother said, "you know you have to go back.
You've been unhappy all your life. You were miserable in
Chicago. I begged you to come home and rightfully you refused
because you felt you should stay with Niles. Now it's time for
you to find some happiness for yourself."


"You're impossible!" I cried. "Do you think I'll come out of
Lanier a new person? Do you think they manufacture ‘happiness’
wholesale out there? If you do, you're deluding yourself. If
I go back, I shall come out as unhappy as I went in. I'll just
learn to tolerate my misery."


"Why must you beat us up so, Laura?" This was my father,
moaning from the bed, hands covering his face. My heart went
out to him, as it always did at the end of an argument. I had at
last murdered him, in a sense. I certainly had wanted to, many
times, and now he was a broken-down coward in spite of all his
money. I wished I hadn't been quite so blunt. But it was too late
to take back my words.


"Let me talk to Laura alone a few minutes, will you?" Niles
asked.


My parents left the room, seeming relieved. Niles pulled the
red velvet chair up beside me as I sat holding Kathy, who was
perfectly content just to lie in my arms.


"You know you have to go back tonight, Laura."


"Why, Niles? Why?" I felt agonized.


"Because this is not how to solve your problem. You always
run away when things get tough. Isn't it about time you acted
your age and did what is best for you?"


I listened to him, for some strange reason. He was taking the
part of a father but this time I didn't resent it. I was certainly

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was then I knew I would return to Lanier. Niles made it
possible for me to feel I was going back on my own. I did not
want to face the hospital again but Niles showed me why it was
necessary I should, and he let me make the choice. Perhaps it
was the way he said it, in a tender but firm voice, rather than the
few words he spoke.


"I know you're right," I said. "And thanks. That's not to say I
don't hate all of you, but at the same time I'm grateful."


Then I asked, "Do you mind if I say good-bye to Kathy?"


"Of course not." He walked to the door to wait for me.


I stood up and placed Kathy once again in the little crib,
tucking the white crocheted blanket under her fragile arms. I
bent over and kissed her, tears in my eyes. "I'll be back soon,
darling," I whispered. "Wait for me. I need just a bit more
time."


She looked at me as if she understood. Her tiny hand,
whether by accident or no, flapped up and touched my cheek as
though to say, "Go to it, Ma. I'll be waiting."


I straightened up. "I'm ready," I said to Niles.


We walked down the long flight of stairs without saying a
word. My parents were waiting at the bottom. "Let's go," said
Niles. We walked out to the car as though to an execution.


My parents sat in the front and Niles and I in the back.
Nobody talked. I was dreading what would happen when I
returned. How did they treat an escapee? Would they seize me
and put me in a straitjacket and seclusion? Jane said no one had
ever successfully run away from the locked hall. Maybe they
would have to devise some heinous new punishment to fit the
unique crime.


I broke the silence by whispering to Niles, "What shall I do if
they put me in isolation?"


"You won't do anything." It was his best doctor-to-patient
voice. "If they lock you up by yourself it's because you deserve
it. You'll just quietly accept your punishment."

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"What a Spartan approach!" I was back to my old sarcasm. "I
realize such an attitude is easy to maintain when someone else
faces the punishment."


Our car was approaching the Lanier turnoff. We began the
winding passage through the grounds. It all seemed a grotesque
nightmare, one lived many times over in a dream, as I thought
of my desperate dash away from the place only a few hours
before. My parents sat like silent sentinels in the front seat. My
husband held my hand tightly as we stopped in front of the
locked hall where I would once again "live," as it was laughingly
called.


Niles opened the door, stepped down and reached back to
help me out.


I clutched his hand. I did not say a word to my mother or
father as I closed the door behind me. I marched over to the
locked hall, Niles at my side.


DR. ROBBINS:


It is not too often that patients, especially those who have
come to a hospital voluntarily, run away. In the first place, they
realize they are in the hospital to be helped. And usually the
hospital takes enough precautions with those patients who are
suicidal, to make running away very difficult.


But Laura is an unusually strong-willed young lady and once
she set her mind on running away, she carried through. She was
furious at Dr. Anders for not moving her to the open hall and at
his words that he would do it when he "felt more comfortable."
He did not mean personally comfortable, but rather more
certain about her being ready for the move. Laura, like most
patients, tends to distort what people say or what lies behind
their words, at times.


Her decision to flee is typical of her life, evidence of what
Freud called the repetition compulsion--the need of the emotionally
unhappy to repeat unconsciously the same acts, over
and over. Laura ran away from her parents' home to her own
apartment, she fled to Niles' home when she fought with her

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is amazing to consider the inappropriate, unrealistic, and
infantile impulse that provokes Laura's escape from the hospital
on the one hand, whereas, on the other, she carefully plans
every step and responds so appropriately to the situation that
she covers her tracks and succeeds in escaping, even telling a
reasonably logical story to the young man who picks her up in
the car. Every intellectual and other faculty of Laura's, all of
which are of considerable capacity, is mobilized to carry out an
essentially neurotic impulse. She is operating in one sense on a
very infantile level and, in another, on a very well-organized
level, conscious of her goals.


Even with all this, however, Laura dramatizes her flight,
indulging in fantasies of rape, fearful of the woods, viewing
herself typically as she has done on so many occasions, as the
poor victim of the mean, nasty hospital that has turned her into
a fugitive. In telling her story to her friend Fran, and to Fran's
mother, she continues to be quite dramatic and exaggerates her
plight as the victim of the misunderstanding, stupidity and
unfeelingness of others.


The situation that Laura creates for Fran and her mother is
certainly an awkward one for them, and they respond quite
appropriately and decently. Laura does not seem to recognize
the tremendous agitation she must be causing them.


Her self-pity and self-dramatization persist as she tells her
parents how she has gone through hell, gashing her legs and
arms, fleeing murderers and rapists, again thinking only of
herself and not of the dilemma she is creating for her parents as
well. When her mother begins to weep, Laura's reaction is to
want to hit her because only she, Laura, has the right to cry.
This episode with her parents repeats almost exactly the form
their visits to Lanier took and must, without question, represent

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697831-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While there has been much evidence that, because of her
immaturity and self-centeredness, Laura has been unable to feel
appropriate maternal feelings of love for Kathy, such feelings
have not been totally absent, as in her knitting slippers for
Kathy. Her wish now to see her baby is a reflection of her feeling
of caring. It is impossible to tell if this more evident love for
the baby is something inherent in Laura, previously masked, or
if it has grown out of some improvement in her as a result of her
treatment. One mustn't forget that in spite of Laura's escape
and the repetition of her neurotic patterns, the gains she made
are still there for her future growth and development emotionally.
In any event, it is certainly a very positive thing that
Laura, even under these circumstances, is able to have and
express the maternal feelings toward Kathy she shows at this
time.


Following the interlude with her baby, Laura quickly reverts
to the hostile, spiteful little child she is emotionally, as she is
confronted by the united decision of her parents and Niles to
return her to Lanier. Her father's question, "Why must you
beat us up so, Laura?" is quite appropriate. It is in Laura's favor
that she is able to see her active role in trying to destroy her
parents because of her rage at them.


At this point Niles steps in and Laura moves away from her
struggle with her father to a more appropriate relationship to
Niles. She allows him to take over and accepts the necessity of
returning to Lanier. This certainly suggests that, in spite of her
running away, there has been a real, positive change in Laura
and, hopefully, she is on the way toward recovery.
