BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Hi George.
CLIENT: Hi.
THERAPIST: How are you?
CLIENT: I'm good, how are you?
THERAPIST: Let me shut the door behind you.
CLIENT: Yeah, they got us in this weird room.
THERAPIST: I know, I'm in different rooms on different days. This is my Friday room.
CLIENT: I got a little bit distracted with Trixie, she's so adorable.
THERAPIST: Oh, I know, did you usually get to see her or -
CLIENT: No, it's the first time I've seen her so that's why -
THERAPIST: Oh, I know, that's like the fun part for me for coming to work here, I'm like, there's animals.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Everyone's like drinking, no.
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: But sometimes I do see people having a glass of wine downstairs.
CLIENT: Well they do have like conferences and things -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - that stuff.
THERAPIST: Yeah, it's like a nice place to work. I enjoy anywhere where there's pets allowed.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right?
CLIENT: That's always (inaudible at 0:00:43).
THERAPIST: Do you have a dog at home?
CLIENT: I don't, I've never had a dog actually, I had a cat when I was younger, but I -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: - a pet for a little bit.
THERAPIST: All right, yeah, pet people.
CLIENT: Yeah, my parents aren't pet people, I guess.
THERAPIST: Yeah, my mom is allergic so now I have a cat though. It's good times.
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: Rebelling. So what happened yesterday? [0:01:02]
CLIENT: Yesterday I was going up to see a concert which I'd known I was going to, but I didn't remember to mention it when I saw you last week so I -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So you knew about it, but you just didn't -
CLIENT: Right, I knew about it and it was like on my planner and everything, but I didn't think about it when I was here last week.
THERAPIST: What concert was it?
CLIENT: The Shins is the band.
THERAPIST: Oh, what kind of music?
CLIENT: I guess Indy Rock music -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I guess that's my -
THERAPIST: Guy singer or girl singer?
CLIENT: A guy singer.
THERAPIST: Okay, cool. The Shins?
CLIENT: The Shins.
THERAPIST: The Shins.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Can you compare them to a artist or not incomparable?
CLIENT: That's tough.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:01:33) people. No?
CLIENT: It's hard, yeah.
THERAPIST: It's hard to do, okay, cool. Actually something before I forget because I keep forgetting to ask you, they're doing some kind of study here on psychologists giving REBT and what the sessions look like so they've asked some of the psychologists here to hand in recordings and you know I do record these sessions. [0:01:58]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But they're for my use and -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - supervision use, I didn't know if you would be comfortable with me submitting your tapes to like -
CLIENT: I would be.
THERAPIST: It would just be for a research assignment -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and your information would not be disclosed.
CLIENT: Yeah, that doesn't really bother me.
THERAPIST: Okay. I didn't think it would.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So I don't have the form on me now, I think someone is looking for it.
CLIENT: Yeah, I have to sign off on that.
THERAPIST: You have to sign a consent form, but just so (inaudible at 0:02:23) knows I can start preparing them and then before I hand it off I'll make sure that I get it -
CLIENT: No problem.
THERAPIST: (inaudible) cool.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I used to be into photography and I remember all the crazy consent forms.
THERAPIST: Oh, yeah, you had to do that there.
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I feel like everything now...I'm sorry, that noise is horrendous.
CLIENT: I know, I don't know what that is, but it -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: It might be the heat, yeah, that's my guess, and the other (inaudible at 0:02:42) it sounds like someone has just like passed wind so that's -
(Chuckle)
THERAPIST: - I hope (inaudible).
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: Sorry.
CLIENT: That's okay.
THERAPIST: So the concert was good.
CLIENT: The concert was great, yeah.
THERAPIST: Who did you go with?
CLIENT: I went with Vicky.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So this non-relationship is -
CLIENT: Is a -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - quickly turning into a relationship.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is that okay, how do you feel about that? [0:03:03]
CLIENT: I feel good about it, I mean I feel good because it hasn't been going too fast because I was definitely wary of it going really, really fast, especially because we dated in the past and it was sort of tumultuous and we both loved each other in a very like high school way when we dated in high school because I had mentioned that before -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, was it the end of high school or the beginning of high school?
CLIENT: It was the beginning of high school for me, it was like my first relationship -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Oh, and she's a few years older.
CLIENT: And she's a few years older than me so it was -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So she probably graduated and -
CLIENT: Yeah, she graduated -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - left you for college men.
CLIENT: That was basically it, or it imploded just before she graduated -
THERAPIST: Oh, okay.
CLIENT: - because of the stress of like (inaudible at 0:03:36) basically.
THERAPIST: Oh, so do you feel like a lot of what you have is based on the past intimacy or not really, like it's just kind of a new relationship?
CLIENT: I mean it definitely built upon that because we did already feel familiar with each other but I think it's more that we're both pretty compatible people with a lot of things in common, a lot of interests in common and so that it made it sort of easy to be interested in her.
THERAPIST: Okay. I guess I have a question because I remember with...Sasha, right? [0:04:04]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: There was the whole like bi-curious aspect of your relationship -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - is it okay if I label it as such?
CLIENT: No, that's -
(Laughter)
CLIENT: - that's exactly how I would label it.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Do you feel still interested in pursuing that?
CLIENT: Yes.
THERAPIST: Does Vicky know about your -
CLIENT: Yeah, I've talked to her -
THERAPIST: interest?
CLIENT: - about that, yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And I was thinking about something that you asked me last week which was how would we both feel if one of us hooked up with someone else.
THERAPIST: Oh yeah, yeah.
CLIENT: And we sort of talked about that, not that in-depth, but a little bit and we basically said that we're not really sure but that if it happened, we would probably be okay with it, but I have a feeling that like maybe we wouldn't be that okay with it, but we weren't really ready to say that yet.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Basically.
THERAPIST: I have a feeling if you both are saying, I don't know how I'd feel about it, that's always a -
CLIENT: That's usually a sign that it's yes.
THERAPIST: I feel like with girls there's always that generally I want you to feel like you can do what you want, but not actually do it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: Because you like me. There's always that under to it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But so - [0:05:02]
CLIENT: And we're both like, like it's funny because actually we have a lot of similar...I don't want to say issues because (inaudible at 0:05:08) like, but I guess there's sort of issues about not always wanting to confront uncomfortable things to confront and like hard things to talk about in our relationships and with other people and that's something that I know about her and I know it's true, I mean -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, after you've had all these experience with Sasha maybe not exactly adequately representing your needs -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - in a relationship, how do you feel about keeping that line of communication now? Do you feel like it's more important?
CLIENT: I feel like it's definitely more important and I'm definitely thinking about it more and I feel like that's one of the...I made a little list of all the things I wanted to -
THERAPIST: Oh, good.
CLIENT: - talk about unrelated to what's going on academically, though some of them are sort of related, but that was one of the things on it -
THERAPIST: Good, I mean that was your homework so -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - look at you, doing your homework. Oh good, so that's good.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think it's just important to keep these issues recognized.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Not -
CLIENT: Or just be aware of them earlier rather than later. [0:05:57]
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: My question is, I don't know how it works for you, but being in a relationship with a girl, would you then feel compelled if you are more bi-curious to then explore other things while you're with or do you feel like while you're with her that is, like you feel completely satisfied?
CLIENT: I mean, right now I feel completely satisfied -
THERAPIST: Okay, which is all you can say -
CLIENT: Yeah, that's -
THERAPIST: - in any relationship.
CLIENT: - all I can really say, I mean, I can't really imagine what it's going to be like, but sort of what I can imagine as like the point where that might be problematic is when I go back to Oberlin potential...well I'm definitely going back to Oberlin early so that's pretty much the same constant in all my plans so far.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And then when I'm there I think there's more of a chance that there would be boys that I would be more interested in hooking up with because I know that they're already there and that I'd be back with them so -
THERAPIST: Yeah, and you've hooked up with them before.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: When you say hook up, you've had sex with them or -
CLIENT: I haven't, that's the thing, and that's why I'm hesitant to say that I'm totally satisfied because I've only really made out with three boys, one of them was sort of like jokingly for him I guess and not for me, I don't know.
THERAPIST: (inaudible at 0:06:59).
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: He was like ha ha.
(Chuckles)
THERAPIST: That was exactly how it went, right?
(Laughter)
CLIENT: - have (inaudible) like I'm drunk and like before I thought that maybe I was into boys but I don't think I'm really into boys but now I'm drunk and I think you're into boys so let's make out as a joke and he was like that was funny and I was like, oh -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Maybe it wasn't a joke for him either.
CLIENT: Yeah, it -
(Laughter)
CLIENT: - wasn't.
(Laughter)
CLIENT But that's how he approached it.
THERAPIST: Okay, so maybe -
CLIENT: But yeah, so I haven't really gone that far with that at all and I'm definitely still really interested and curious about that and -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Okay, and that's something to be honest with Vicky that -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: Yeah, and that's something that I have, I mentioned to her, I've been like I am interested in boys and I was like really straight up with that, and we had a pretty big conversation -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Good, and she says, what did she say about that?
CLIENT: She was like, oh, wow, that's like, I wouldn't have guessed that but actually it sort of makes sense and it was like more in that perspective, not really responding to what we're going to do about it really.
THERAPIST: Okay, got you. And then I guess you have time because you have a whole almost seven months or something before you end up going back to Oberlin.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So but I know -
CLIENT: Yeah, because if -
THERAPIST: - if you guys continually in a different place in your relationship. [0:08:07]
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I mean who knows what's going to -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - happen in seven months, that's the thing. But the one thing that I am pretty certain about is that if I do want, like when I go further with exploring my curiosity or bisexuality or whatever, that I - and this is something like I thought about a lot is - I want to do it with someone that I feel comfortable with and actually want to do it with because I've had opportunities to just like go for it before but I wasn't really ready or didn't feel particularly like that person was the -
THERAPIST: It's like a big step.
CLIENT: - right person and I don't really have anyone around in my life right now that I feel that way about and if I suddenly meet one then I'll totally think about it, but maybe that will happen, but I definitely can wait until I find that person to really think about it I feel like.
THERAPIST: Definitely. Is sex with a guy a potentially an anxiety provoking or it's more exciting and you just haven't had the opportunity?
CLIENT: It's more exciting, I mean I don't know what it's like so it's a little bit like fresh and new and uncertain but I'm not really anxious about it at all - [0:09:01]
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Because I've had some good friends who have been kind of anxious (inaudible) about that, but okay. So it's more it just hasn't presented itself in a comfortable environment.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, it's more that like the one person I would have been most comfortable with was the friend who was sort of joking because he's actually one of my closer friends and I would have been totally down, but it didn't work out with him and there was this boy that I was like ready to do it with before I got asked to leave from Oberlin and that sort of cut it off before it could happen.
THERAPIST: Yeah, and that would have been fine with - sorry, my nose is looking crinkly at you, that's allergies - that would have been -
CLIENT: That would have been -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - with Sasha -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - at the time full -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: It would have been but she sort of was a little bit less okay with it than she said, but she was okay with me hooking up with guys because she wanted to hook up with girls at the same time and that was sort of safe, but the idea of me hooking up with a girl would have been really (inaudible). [0:09:48]
THERAPIST: Okay. Before we...because we should move on, I mean this is just -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - I'm like, oh, this is interesting -
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: - what do you want to work on.
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: It's fine.
THERAPIST: But I guess one thing just I think maybe to be aware of and keeping in mind is that not everyone is okay with open relationships -
CLIENT: Oh yeah.
THERAPIST: - and in the past that was something that Sasha was okay, but I think -
CLIENT: But most people aren't -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - that you may have to make choices -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - between what is more important being with a person or leave yourself open for, but I'm sure you're aware of -
CLIENT: Yeah -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - that that situation could come up. [0:10:19]
CLIENT: I'm pretty sure that I can't just like walk straight out of one like sort of ideal open relationship situation, at least ideal in the open relationship (inaudible) but not -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: But sometimes -
CLIENT: - because it was actually pretty limited and one-sided, but anyway I didn't expect to suddenly be able to have another one of those, yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, but just because once you make...it's like a choice between the intimacy that you have in a committed relationship that sometimes you can't -
CLIENT: Versus -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - go back and forth.
CLIENT: - to explore, yeah -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - it's really, I don't know if those two are really that compatible even the limited success of what I had sort of showed the limitations of that.
THERAPIST: Yeah, so you know, eventually you might not be able to have your cake and eat it too.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But right now you're in a comfortable spot and it sounds like things are going well with Vicky?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah?
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - discuss with Vicky and that relationship or - [0:11:03]
CLIENT: Yeah, I want to talk about sort of remaining vigilant and making sure that I'm expressing myself and things like that because those are part of the issues that I want to talk about on my list of -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Okay. Do you want to get out the list?
CLIENT: (inaudible).
THERAPIST: Must have that list.
CLIENT: I also made this other list but I did it on my computer and I forgot to print it out but I wrote down all the things that I thought about potentially doing in the future like as careers.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Oh cool, yeah, that was part of it, and do you remember -
CLIENT: I remember them all, but I don't have the...I could write it down right now but I might -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Okay, we can just go through it, I mean we don't need a -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Which right -
CLIENT: Either one, but start on the left I guess.
THERAPIST: Oh my God, these are a lot.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: All right, so -
CLIENT: Some of them are duplicates though I realize -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So the ones on the left are kind of like emotional goals?
CLIENT: The ones on the left are like goals related to me that aren't really related to school, though some of them are related to what I'm going to do in the future and stuff which are like I guess sort of related to school. And the ones on the right are potential plans for this coming spring and what I can do then. [0:12:04]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because that's the more localized what I'm going to do (inaudible).
THERAPIST: So you're kind of interested in that idea that we brought up, the potential narcissism.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Is that the first time you've kind of -
CLIENT: Like come to terms with that about myself? No, it totally is, it's been like a weird like coming out of the narcissism closet.
(Laughter)
CLIENT: And it makes me feel a lot more comfortable actually with myself in a way, but I also wanted to talk about that because I've always had this idea that narcissists - and I mean like narcissists aren't generally well represented in literature or culture or anything and they're usually like extreme people who go too far and that's why I don't -
THERAPIST: And just because there's -
CLIENT: - I want to like -
THERAPIST: - you can be narcissistic in one aspect of your life, you know, I think that a lot of people have an aspect of their life that they're arrogant -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and feel like they shouldn't have to work any harder and that's usually the things that they're good at, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So while we can look...actually maybe if you want, we can take -
CLIENT: And also I really need to elaborate about all the things I'm listed, I didn't really like write down everything about -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Okay. And - [0:13:01]
CLIENT: - but it's also that I can weirdly - because in the past like I was a narcissist, I was sort of aware of it but I didn't really like admit it to myself ever, but at the same time I could be really certain and proud and - I guess certain, I already said certain - of my abilities in whatever field, but I could also really doubt myself and not feel confident at all and be really insecure at the same time.
THERAPIST: In the same field or -
CLIENT: Yeah, about the same thing which is weird and I sort of wanted to talk about -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So could maybe kind of like an overcompensating?
CLIENT: Yeah, or that's sort of like I'm wavering back and forth I guess -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Actually there's a theory of how - what's it called - (inaudible at 0:13:39) some people have historically said it's really just low self-esteem and there's like two...there's the compensating -
CLIENT: Yeah -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: - compensating, yeah.
THERAPIST: That's apparently a very limited...most narcissists are pretty narcic (ph), but you have to...this idea that you have to kind of like maintain that level and when that level is threatened, that level of "I'm fabulous," you know.
CLIENT: Yeah. [0:14:03]
THERAPIST: And when that level is threatened then it kind of some people plummet into "oh, I'm the worst person in the world, I want to die type of thing - "
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - until they find some evidence that they're wonderful again and it goes back up, and people wouldn't say that they're compensating, they're this type of narcissists that would just be like you really need to defend that position and when it's threatened, when that -
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - you know, that thing you feel so strongly about is threatened, then it becomes very challenging to your whole identity. But I would say maybe you do fall in that specific little population that some people don't say that we've over (inaudible at 0:14:36) compensating and that could be possible because you certainly do have insecurities in other aspects -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and you've had difficulties asserting yourself before.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I wouldn't call you a narcissist, you know, maybe you have some tendencies.
CLIENT: Yeah, no, I have some tendencies -
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: But I wouldn't call you a narcissist.
CLIENT: I know, I don't think it's like that extreme.
THERAPIST: And then the social anxiety.
CLIENT: It's just that it's so like new and crazy for me to even say it at all that I've -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - been thinking about in this - [0:15:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah, no, it's -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: - way, I guess.
THERAPIST: The tendency to abandon interests in people, do you feel that that may be related -
CLIENT: I put question marks in parentheses around people because I always wait, maybe I'm being too hard on myself with that, I haven't really dropped that many people but sometimes I'm like and I think that's sort of a natural process of going through relationships where sometimes you want to be friends with someone a lot more and then you realize that maybe they're not so great and you don't have that much in common and there are all these other -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - things that didn't work out and I don't think I should feel about it -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - and that's why I separated it. But I definitely do drop interests without really proper consideration.
THERAPIST: And sometimes that might be...because you certainly had kind of like an avoidant like the low frustration tolerance leads -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - to like avoiding of things, so has it been with things that kind of are difficult or take a little too much time and then you drop them?
CLIENT: It's always with something that I expected a lot to come sort of easily and then when it gets hard, I'm like oh wait, I don't really want to do this maybe I'll -
THERAPIST: Well that's -
CLIENT: - find something else that seemed more promising and in my ideals to fantasies basically. [0:15:59]
THERAPIST: Yeah, and then goes along with your low frustration tolerance which kind of -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - goes along with the narcissist, you know, that they kind of lump together.
CLIENT: Yeah, there's a lot of interconnections.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, and the decision making problem goes along with your -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - parents dependence. Okay. And so then is this the order or the hierarchy that you've -
CLIENT: Sort of, but no wait, it's really fragmented because I have two different sub-choices because I think that I definitely do want to go to a cooking school somewhere for part of the time and then that's the choice between the first three, I could go in Maine -
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: - or I could go in Chicago and do it kind of like periodically throughout whatever else I'm doing in Chicago or I could go to California, I found another - like the right length program that's like 2 1/2 months I think.
THERAPIST: Okay. So you've done a lot of research.
CLIENT: Yeah, and that was the only other comparable program I found, but there's like seven cooking schools in Chicago with a ton of different, like weekend or two day or four day classes that I could - [0:16:58]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - space around throughout different activities. So then my choice is really which one of those three do I want to combine with what of the rest on this list.
THERAPIST: Well I would say since you do have...you do have like seven months, right?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And you know you can start looking these up, you could even start taking classes if you really wanted to push it -
CLIENT: Yeah -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - but I don't know if I would do it before finals, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: But that's coming up real fast and a lot of these programs that you're looking at kind of like are two months, right?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, well the ones in Chicago I didn't really find anything that was that length but if I did that, it would be I'm sure shorter classes.
THERAPIST: Okay. And the California one is a few months?
CLIENT: The California one is 2 1/2 months and the one in Maine, the details are a little bit sketchy about what different classes they have when.
THERAPIST: Okay. And do they have a start time or do they continuously kind of start every -
CLIENT: The one in California has a start time and that's in, it's like the end of January, like January 20 something -
THERAPIST: So that one is -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: My thinking was that you could try out the cooking classes for a while -
CLIENT: Yeah, and so probably doing it in Chicago -
THERAPIST: It might make more sense because you never know -
CLIENT: I could do it on the short term basis. [0:18:01]
THERAPIST: - if you'll like it and then you could do a longer term one, you're like "oh, this is my calling, I got to do this" -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but then at that point you can think about even doing it after college and -
CLIENT: Yeah, I have the feeling though that even if I go and I decide that it isn't my calling that I'll still be really interested in it just because cooking is something you can do on your own no matter what you do.
THERAPIST: Definitely, definitely. And then you're thinking about volunteering just in general.
CLIENT: In general, I didn't really have a specific idea because I used to have a specific idea about going to New Orleans, but that didn't really work out bureaucratically with Oberlin, they didn't really want me to go because I wasn't a current Oberlin student which I didn't think was how they would be about it, but apparently they were. And there were other opportunities I could do but they were for a much bigger chunk of time and I don't know if I want to do that.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But, yeah, the whole like New Orleans idea sort of got -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: I certainly think that if you did the cooking school in Chicago and that kind of thing you can work on the...you could get a lot of these other goals accomplished at the same time. [0:18:58]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So that might be the best because then you could get a lot of work done on your Oberlin paper and have an easier year.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So that might be something to consider.
CLIENT: Yeah, I think the Oberlin paper's probably going to be in my plan no matter what and definitely going back to Oberlin and moderating is going to make my life a whole lot easier when I do come back.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: But so I guess that's like a false choice, it's sort of it's always included but it's really between all the other things. And really, like I'll be really honest about my priorities when I was looking at the different cooking schools, part of me wants to just have a little escape where I can maybe get out of my parents' house and out of Chicago for a little bit and go do something else and then come back, but I'm not sure if it's really that worth it to ask my parents to spend more money on something that is maybe not the perfect use of my time and what I want to do.
THERAPIST: Yeah, have you ever held a job before?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: You have, where did you work before?
CLIENT: I've worked at...I only really like had one real job, I've had some school related jobs that are jobs, but it's a weird application process and not really the same as the real world, but I worked at a Chinese restaurant for a few months last year actually as a waiter. [0:20:12]
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So you have, I don't know, do you have a lot of money saved?
CLIENT: I don't.
THERAPIST: I mean this could be an opportunity in between classes -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - to get a job, work, I mean -
CLIENT: Yeah, I think the probably getting a job is like the leading option to me and combining it with whatever else I can fit into my schedule, but -
THERAPIST: Because when you talk about it's like the ideas of wanting independence but living -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - at home.
CLIENT: Well, yeah, that's really the -
THERAPIST: It's a difficult...yeah.
CLIENT: Because I have this great safety net to rely upon for whenever I'm not sure what I want to do whenever I want to do something that I couldn't afford on my own, but I also want to move away from that and not really rely on it as much.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I have to pick what I want to rely on it for, I feel like -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean because living at home, I mean, it's hard economic times, a lot of people I know even people my age and older have had to move back home and - [0:21:03]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - despite their (inaudible), but this I guess it could be a long period of time living at home, but while living at home you kind of see it as not being independent, you could be taking all these steps like -
CLIENT: To be independent -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - having your own money so that you know when you graduate you could, if you so wanted, find an apartment, you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or even have more spending money so that if you want to do a program like that, you could actually pay it for yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And things like that. So I think that that's something to think about.
CLIENT: Yeah, that was actually the hardest choice honestly, I guess I really made that misrepresented me because I sort of know what I want to do, but -
THERAPIST: Okay, so which is?
CLIENT: - the cooking school thing I'm still uncertain of because I do want to sort of escape for a little bit but I also feel like staying in Chicago might just make more sense on some level, but then in terms of staying here, I'm pretty sure that I do want to get a job and do whatever else I can do on the side, but I can't decide whether I should get a really boring law related job that my dad could probably hook me up with where I'll make a lot more money or whether I should work in a restaurant for not that much or actually nothing because I'm going to be volunteering my time to get some skills. [0:22:10]
THERAPIST: Oh yeah.
CLIENT: Because even if I was getting paid, I mean, like I had a summer job that my dad hooked me up with downtown two summers ago and I got paid like...it was insane, I got paid $20 an hour, it was Tuesday to Thursday, 10 to 5, it was like -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - it was too cushy honestly -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So I mean, yeah, if you want to do something -
CLIENT: - but I could do something like that -
THERAPIST: - that's related to what you're interested in, that could always be great. Have you thought about more like a restaurant in Indiana that you could talk to somebody in?
CLIENT: Yeah, I've looked into a few different places around and I feel like I have one opportunity with this restaurant that my parents go to all the time because they're friendly with the owners and I might be able to work there, but it's another Chinese restaurant and I don't know if I want to be boxed into Chinese food, but I could just go for it -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: That could be a good starting off point.
CLIENT: It's definitely nice to have something that I can sort of rely on at least some nepotistic connection helping me out with.
THERAPIST: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Yeah, that could be something to think about. I think it would be important at this point to kind of move towards what you think your goal is so that you can either decide that you like it or rule it out and then spend your time doing something else. [0:23:17]
CLIENT: Okay, cool, that's what I wanted to hear but I had this feeling that maybe I should just make a lot of money so I can be more independent, but I also don't really want to do that -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: As much as -
CLIENT: - I hated it when I did that last -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: And as much as you can do that, you know you do need to be working towards...it's what you want I think, like what we're working on it's better to be...you know, have some kind of goal in mind than to be making money because you'd be kind of aimless still even though you'd have -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - money and then probably still you're not going to have enough to -
CLIENT: To really -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - make a career out of it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Right? I do think though that you...maybe when you talk to chefs and things like that - because I've heard from other people in the food industry that since Top Chef and Hell's Kitchen -
CLIENT: There's a lot more interest.
THERAPIST: - there's a lot more interest in cooking and people don't realize how difficult the job is. [0:24:06]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Did you feel like you have a -
CLIENT: Have -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - have you had a handle on how difficult and perhaps financially unrewarding -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - it would be?
CLIENT: I have some sense of that, I mean, just from even being a waiter in a little Chinese restaurant and ran back, like I know about how much everyone is constantly scrimping and constantly thinking about how you can do everything the most efficiently and waste the fewest amount of resources because everything is about saving money, so the restaurant makes money and that it's not very glamorous at all -
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - in the actual kitchen part of it that you don't really see when you're in a restaurant.
THERAPIST: Okay. And also that you know in the beginning you talked about maybe that little bit of Mediterranean food cart, are -
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST: - you still thinking that that's a realistic goal or something that could work?
CLIENT: Not like right now, but maybe a little bit in the future, but it's sort of like contradictory with doing anything else at the same time, so I have no idea.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: I just feel like there's a lot of other gourmet food carts in Chicago, I feel like that's been - [0:25:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: - a thing recently, I don't know, and I feel like -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: No, it could be a cool...I don't know enough about the restaurant -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: I don't know about how viable that really is -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, and just the rate of restaurants failure and things like that and -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - investing money and losing money, so it's just things to think about. And also I think once you have your foot in the door, you can see if maybe you really do like the culinary side but there are...remember we talked about other jobs within -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: (inaudible) or I could be a micro (inaudible) owner or like a wine distributor or were there any others on the list, I'm trying to remember.
THERAPIST: Yeah, I don't know, yeah, like you could manage a restaurant and probably feel like it's maybe a little further away?
CLIENT: Yeah, it wouldn't be that far off though, I mean, I'd have to have some money to manage a restaurant -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, and they pay pretty well -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - it's pretty crap hours but, you know, weekends. But I have a friend who is a restaurant manager, I think it's hard work but -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - can be rewarding, you know.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Can be rewarding, they always need restaurant managers, right?
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. [0:25:57]
THERAPIST: So these are all like really hard jobs, I think stress wise and time wise but if that's something that you're passionate about, it seems like when you're passionate you really can get shit done.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So...
CLIENT: So yeah, I think that I should give it a shot at least and see how it goes.
THERAPIST: At least pursue it and you have these months that most people don't have, you can almost see them as a gift.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because you haven't had the financial kind of -
CLIENT: Concerns or -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: And punishment, like some people might have in this situation -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - it hasn't turned out like, "oh now I'm $15,000 in the hole or - "
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - probably like 40,000, whatever how much, yeah, $40,000 in the hole, you know, it's not that kind of thing because your parents can help you so you have a really great chance, you know?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: To really explore this that many people would kill for, but it sounds like you're making really good progress and you're looking at all your avenues. So what is it - because I kind of think we've been kind of refocusing - what is it that you would like to work on for next week? Because you've kind of decided how you want to organize, right, so you're going to decide upon a program or - [0:27:05]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST: - a course of action.
CLIENT: Yeah, and maybe see if there's like a two day or one day thing that I can do sometime even before this semester is over -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, if you want, if you don't want...yeah -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and then -
CLIENT: If I can sneak it in like soon enough before it's finals crunch time, then I can think I can -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Yeah, I mean the one time ones especially.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Definitely. That could be great and then you can have Christmas break and all that time to do it -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - so you can try that out, find a good program, I mean, and once you're there you could even ask them, you know, just because you're (inaudible at 0:27:34) they would have some recommendations.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Or have you even called up...what is it - the FCI?
CLIENT: Oh no, I haven't.
THERAPIST: Because you can call them up and say, you know, I'm interested in maybe a shorter term, is there something that you can recommend.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So maybe -
(Crosstalk)
CLIENT: - anything like that -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: - maybe there is -
CLIENT: - the Internet pretty exclusively.
THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe there is a two month one -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - that or something like that in Chicago that you don't know about.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Have you gone to the FCI website?
CLIENT: Yeah, I have.
THERAPIST: So they have it online there.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Okay. Well you never know, it's worth a -
CLIENT: It's true, it's always worth asking.
THERAPIST: They might have someone to recommend you though, they probably want the money for themselves. You never know what's going to happen. [0:28:07]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: So your emotional kind of...the more emotional goals that -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - we would work towards.
CLIENT: We sort of already addressed them, but there's just like, they come out in other areas of my life -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: So do you want to work towards acceptance...because I feel like you're kind of on a good track of the acceptance of where you feel maybe overly confident, we don't have to call it narcissistic -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and acceptance of that and maybe feeling not so confident in other areas, do you feel like comfortable with that -
CLIENT: Yeah, I feel pretty comfortable with that.
THERAPIST: - so maybe move towards the assertion?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Asserting yourself?
CLIENT: Yeah, that's definitely what I want to move towards.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Because it's not so much that I'm like...like I guess I still am like nervous in some situations that are related to this, but I know how to like accept that and move past it, but I don't really know what to do then, like I don't have that many great coping strategies I guess.
THERAPIST: Okay. So coping strategies and dealing with anxiety over social situations or asserting yourself - [0:29:01]
CLIENT: And also asserting myself really.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And I feel like those two are pretty related because I don't have anxiety in every social situation, but when I'm meeting new people and in really unfamiliar situations where you do sort of have to assert yourself, that's when it's hard for me.
THERAPIST: So in a situation where you'd have to assert yourself or maybe state your preference or -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - demands in a relationship or even a friendship.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you kind of get walked over sometimes?
CLIENT: Definitely sometimes I get walked over.
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: And like historically in my life, like my mom was quick to point this out because my mom hated my relationship with Sasha and she was just like "she's controlling your life, blah, blah, blah, blah." And she was always like "well on the playground, you were always the kid who was like waiting to go on the swing in line and all the other kids would cut in front of you and you wouldn't stand up for yourself and -
THERAPIST: Okay, yeah, we can definitely work on that.
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: There is a good book downstairs, I think I mentioned it to you a while ago, but I know you're kind of swamped with schoolwork -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - but there's a book called -
CLIENT: I think I can fit it in, I'm not that swamped obviously -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: - I'd actually been doing really well -
THERAPIST: Really.
CLIENT: - with getting work done, I didn't have class this morning and I got a ton of stuff done in the library while I was waiting before the session - [0:30:01]
THERAPIST: Great.
CLIENT: - and I don't remember if I told you about both of my mid-term grades I got back, but I got an A on two of my mid-term grades -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: I heard about the A on one, but I didn't -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - know about the A, so how'd that feel?
CLIENT: And it felt good again.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
(Laughter)
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Do you feel like you're getting...now how'd you feel if you got another thing back and you got a C?
CLIENT: I would wonder what the hell happened -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: And would you feel maybe annoyed? Like -
CLIENT: I would feel annoyed, yeah.
THERAPIST: Like I should have done better, like I can do better.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Because you're setting a standard for yourself.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I think that's good.
CLIENT: And I'm starting to actually like hold myself -
(Laughter)
THERAPIST: Okay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Good. So we have some goals -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - and we'll get to work next week.
CLIENT: And I'll come back with the list of all the different careers that I thought about because it's sort of funny.
THERAPIST: Definitely, and we'll talk about researching -
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: - them. I had something...let me check the date, there's like a conference I'm going to, I'm not quite sure....Your normal time is Thursdays...oh, actually, no, it'll be fine, it'll be fine. [0:30:59]
CLIENT: Okay.
THERAPIST: Not an issue, that'll be for the Friday people, but you're a Thursday person.
CLIENT: I'm going to write it down and it's a regular day just (inaudible at 0:31:06).
THERAPIST: And then I guess we'll miss before Thanksgiving.
CLIENT: Oh, yeah. So wait, that's next...today's the fifth, so it's the 12th.
THERAPIST: So I'll see you regular time, 5 o'clock on the 12th.
CLIENT: And then the next week is Thanksgiving? I forgot when Thanksgiving is.
THERAPIST: I think it's the week after that, yeah.
CLIENT: Oh, okay.
THERAPIST: Week after that. Okay?
CLIENT: All right. Thanks -
(Crosstalk)
THERAPIST: I think we got some work done, it was more of a like a figuring out session, I couldn't think of a word for it, but -
CLIENT: No, but that's -
