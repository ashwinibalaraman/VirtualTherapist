BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So tell me how have things been going?
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay for the most part uh and I've had, I don't know you know the anxiety from school getting ready to start or just I've felt like I've had some like manic type episodes just uh up all night, constantly going, you know I'm tired during the day and then when I get ready for bed, normally I'm trying to drag him to bed and stuff like that, I'll stay up another two or three hours um sometimes um I mean there's been two, three, four o'clock, I just, I get into something, doing something and I just keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going and um sometimes I catch myself you know.
<b>DR:</b> Like the computer?
<b>PT:</b> Like the computer and I hadn't done that in a long, long, long time as far as.
<b>DR:</b> You've got to stay away from that thing after about ten o'clock.
<b>DR:</b> You know my thing has been working and creating things for school you know for my classroom and stuff, but it's just like once I get going it's been like an addiction you know type of, I mean I just have to keep going and then I figure out a way to do something better, you know, where normally I would have just gotten on, checked my e-mails, piddled around a few minutes and gotten off, um I feel myself um at times, I don't know if it's because the kids are getting older, um, but I'm getting more agitated than you know um I would have.
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever feel like your thoughts are racing, like they're going too fast?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, I had, like I said I hadn't felt like that in a long, long time, but sometimes I feel like I've got so much in my head that I can't um.
<b>DR:</b> Sometimes it results in irritability?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> I would imagine you've been able to notice that from time to time? Does she talk a lot and have a lot of stuff going off.
<b>PT:</b> I catch myself thinking, you know, I think I'm just running. Sometimes I don't even realize what I, you know what I have said because I said so much out there at one time I think that.
CG: It's all just the same, the stuff in there is still working, you know, it's just if you got a bad back cause the accident and everything, a bad neck, and she'll get into something and I got to kind of stop her and tell her you know you're going to have to have surgery on your back if you keep going like this so that she pushes herself too far, till it's hurting.
<b>DR:</b> It's hard to accept those limitations cause you know you're, you know if you were [AGE] years old and kind of had grown into it, and say I don't know but.
<b>PT:</b> And that's how I feel sometimes when I kept going to my you know limits, I mean I've, I've had two cervical epidurals already because of the back pain to try to avoid surgery and I'm on my third one next week, you know at two week intervals.
<b>DR:</b> Are they helping?
<b>PT:</b> They help, I mean like right now I can tell that I'm getting close to it because the pinching and the stuff, it has actually helped alleviate some of the back problems, um, but um you know it's just temporary, they're lasting, you know, just a couple of weeks and but compared to how I was getting around and stuff like that and everything it's, but I have noticed the raciness and stuff like that and it's kind of scared me. You know, I'll have, I'll be complaining to him since about eight or nine o'clock are you ready for bed, are you ready for bed, are you ready for bed, when we finally make it to bed, some days I'm just kind of laying there because they're so much in my head that I can't get to sleep you know.
<b>DR:</b> How long have you noticed it going on?
<b>PT:</b> About three or four weeks or so now.
<b>DR:</b> It's been a while since you've had that huh?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I mean really to, I mean it's not as bad as it has been but I real, I think, I think that the last time that I actually felt like this was before my accident. You know some of the other stuff that I talked to you about and stuff like that I think has just been you know, just regular day to day anxiety, raising kids type things and stuff like that, but um you know the.
<b>DR:</b> That wouldn't play when you're you know laying in bed ready to go to sleep and no reason not too and you're mind's going, well we probably ought to start some medicine to try to you know stabilize those moods and slow those thoughts down um, what have you taken in the past in terms of mood stabilizers?
<b>PT:</b> Uh I it's been so.
<b>DR:</b> Been Depakote, Neurontin that doesn't really work all that well, Seroquel, how did Seroquel work for you?
<b>PT:</b> That's the one that I took, that one in combination with something else, I just felt like a zombie.
<b>DR:</b> Probably is the.
<b>PT:</b> I think that was the one, I just, I felt like I was just there, you know I wasn't part of anything.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it does make you pretty sedated plus it can cause weight gain.
<b>PT:</b> Well we don't need that because I've already, I've put, I mean I've put more weight on, I'm at the weight that I was when I gave birth to the baby three years ago and so we're going in the wrong direction already.
<b>DR:</b> How many hours of sleep are you getting?
<b>PT:</b> Um.
<b>DR:</b> Average?
<b>PT:</b> About five maybe.
<b>DR:</b> That's on a good night?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like you're.
<b>PT:</b> But then I try to keep you know during the day I feel like if I lay down I could sleep for eight or nine hours and I avoid that because then you know I'm afraid that that would keep me up even more at night and now that school is getting ready to start back you know I have to, I have to start getting up early again, getting ready and leaving the house by seven and.
<b>DR:</b> How are things going at work for you?
<b>PT:</b> Well I haven't had the summer off like I was supposed to. I, you know presented a summer camp program for the school for them to run and I have been basically working there for free because I can't, you know I can't make any money. I think I, I think that if I'd been able to have the summer free like I have in the past that I probably wouldn't be so stressed out. I probably wouldn't be as anxious as I am and stuff like that, but um I mean I've put in over 250 hours this summer which you know I feel like a lot of things are falling on me because they're not paying, you know because I'm not getting paid and um and in previous summers I've had the summer off, I've had those three months to recuperate and gather my you know my fuel back up for you know the school year and stuff like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah that's kind of a no brainer, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do so I think we still want to try to get on top of it before symptoms get worse. Um there's a medicine called Lamictal that is weight neutral, you will not gain weight from it. It's not sedating, usually people take it in the evening, but some people take it in the morning and they're fine with that. Um it's a mood stabilizer so as such it tends to only work when you're starting to rev up, like the governor on an engine, so if you're going at a normal speed it wouldn't have any effect at all. Uh it also has some antidepressant effect which is not a bad thing, kind of unusual in that regard but it does. Um it is very tolerated medicine, rarely do we see any side effects at all. Ninety five percent of people experience no side effects, the few that do is relatively minor stuff like headache or backache something like that, nausea, I don't know five percent drug, three percent placebo that kind of stuff, however, I have one, one bad possibility and that is skin rash. Very, very rare, but it could be very serious. They had one study that was 17 out of 37,000 people just developed a skin rash from it. If that's to happen you must stop the medicine and it'll go away. I must caution everybody with that. It sounds like kind of a big deal but actually statistically it's quite unlikely to happen. Not going to worry, haven't even actually seen it happen, but there were actually some cases where people ignored it and kept taking it and the rash just got horrendous and exfoliated skin and had to go in the hospital and all that, so bottom line is it's a very well tolerated medicine, young people like it particularly because it doesn't slow you down, you're able to think clearly, work, you don't gain weight. It does have a little antidepressant boost that would add to the Wellbutrin, but most importantly it would, in time, slow down some of the raciness. Are you using the Lunesta at night for sleep?
<b>PT:</b> No it usually don't get me until it got so late sometimes that I you know?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And with you know the baby in the house he'll be three in another couple of days you know.
<b>DR:</b> Oh boy.
<b>PT:</b> I need to be up and going and alert.
<b>DR:</b> Lunesta's not usually that knock out sedating type of medicine. Usually people are able to get up and function. Obviously a little more sleepy, uh, well it sounds like it's not quite at a point where it's critical, you know try to get to bed earlier and relax and it will take a while for the Lamictal to work. The one thing because of that skin rash they found that by going real slow you minimize it, so we got a little pack I'll give you that delineates how you take them and you start out with a dinky amount for a week and then slightly increase and in short it takes about a month and a half to get up to full steam and give it time to work, so you won't get like any immediate relief. You could use a Lunesta in the meantime as long as it's not overly sedating to you, I don't think it would be, most people find they can get up when the baby cries or the telephone rings and you're on call or whatever, they think pretty clearly pretty quickly. So the Xanax seems to work as well as the Klonopin or better or?
<b>PT:</b> Um some days, some days I feel like I need you know more. Um.
<b>DR:</b> Well I could maybe give you the option of increasing to three a day, if you're having a rough day. Again if the Lamictal strikes a homerun, of course it'll be a little while off, but you know in six, eight weeks I would expect you to say you know I'm just a lot more focused and calmer, sleeping better, maybe kind of back down to where you were, but in the meantime to try to get something between now and then we can go to three a day or take two of these or whatever, whatever works for you. I rewrite that for 90 pills.   Um the Wellbutrin sounds like it's doing okay, let's leave it like it is and the target with the Lamictal is 100 mg one at night, it doesn't make much difference when you take it, but makes you [INAUDIBLE]. I'll get that sample back there and explain how that works. Night is probably as good as any, but it doesn't matter. And the first week is taking one little tiny pill, second week one little tiny pill, third week two of them, fourth week two of them, fifth week target 100 mg that's what you're prescription will be. Now go ahead and get started with it and make sure it agrees with you before you waste any money on it.
<b>PT:</b> Oh all right.
<b>DR:</b> But as you can see I don't expect any results at all here.
<b>PT:</b> Oh okay.
<b>DR:</b> Just kind of [INAUDIBLE] and also with that rash they found that almost always it happens within the first month or so.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So you'll know right off the bat and that's the reason for going slow and if you make it to here and you haven't had any problems then you can pretty much put it out of your mind. All right let's give that a try, give you more Xanax when you feel like you need it, wouldn't hurt either probably. How about your other prescription they're about due anyway?
<b>PT:</b> Uh you've got his new [INAUDIBLE] don't you?
<b>DR:</b> It's Friday.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The rest of the prescriptions are running [INAUDIBLE] or do you get three months at a time and looks like Wellbutrin we had a refill for that, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, you'll be good till next year on that, just gonna scratch that out. Like I said you could double up the morning or the evening depending on when you think the anxiety might be worse, or you could three times a day. Use it the way you want, tell you that, kind of see what works for you best. I would say three a day but prescription 270 and if you back down, which I think you will, be able to back down back to two, then save some extra. Okay sounds like a plan then, get this thing nipped in the bud before it gets worse. Have you gained any weight lately?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I've put on since the baby's been born I've put on probably a good 35 pounds, uh I mean I haven't been able to walk or exercise like I normally do because of the problems with my back and my neck, but still um and that's part, one of the things that has me so down you know, it's effecting my mood and you know and stuff like that because I've put on so much weight.
<b>DR:</b> How much do you weigh now?
<b>PT:</b> Too much. Like 225.
<b>DR:</b> How tall are you?
<b>PT:</b> 5'6" I mean I should be weighing probably about, I mean at 165, 175 I'm not bad, you know I but I mean I just, it's just been continuously, I'm going in the wrong direction since the baby's been born.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah it's sometimes hard to put that weight back behind you. Well it's a good time of year for water exercises, unfortunately it's too damn hot to do much of anything else, but that would be easier on your back as well, but at least we're not giving you any medicines like Seroquel which can cause weight gain, so, all right well maybe with a little more energy and focus you'll feel a little more inclined to focus more on your diet and get a little bit more exercise. Copy these for you, go ahead and start the samples on that and keep the Wellbutrin the same and Xanax has been increased if you need to.
<b>PT:</b> I mean that's part of my problem too when my mood is down or when I get upset or whatever, whatever you know I don't have to be hungry but I will find.
<b>DR:</b> Food for anxiety huh?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I do that if I wake up in the middle of the night, it's me and the ice cream can get bad. Okay.
