<font size="4"><b>Chapter 11: Fear: Phobia</b></font>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


The preceding chapters have dealt with disorders in
which the cognitive functions of consciousness seemed
to be the primary processes involved in the psychopathological
experience. However, one can never say
with certainty that only one aspect or attribute of the
mind is the most important feature of psychopathology.
The reader probably has noticed, in most of the
excerpts cited where disorders of perception and of
memory have constituted the patient's basic complaints,
that there was frequently much concomitant
evidence of the patient's realization of his inability to
control his behavior, coupled with a pervasive fear
regarding the outcome of his disability. In such complex
mental turmoils, it is usually not too clear or
certain whether the primary disorder is cognitive, conative,
or emotional in nature. There are mental aberrations
in which the expressions of certain emotions and
subjective feeling states do seem to be the primary
phenomena of the pathology. These are states in which
fear or phobia, melancholia or depression, mania or
ecstasy, hopelessness or despair, love or pain, as well

Most accounts of mental disorders make mention of fear or some
variety of fear. The essential difference between normal and abnormal
fear does not lie so much in the experience itself as it does in the attendant
circumstances. If the fear is provoked by some real, imminent
threat or danger, it is considered normal; if it has no apparent basis in
fact, it is usually considered to be abnormal. Peters neatly phrased this
distinction in the quality of the emotion by saying,
<blockquote>
<p>
The only thing a madman attacks instinctively is the <i>presence</i> of fear.
A "normal" man attacks the <i>thing</i> he fears. There is a difference. (Peters, 1949,
p. 301)

<i>The Nature of Phobia</i>


The description of the experience of fear or of phobia is a favorite
literary device, usually aimed at the arousal of sympathetic fear in the
reader; as, for example, in the horror story or the thriller. These literary
productions are obviously not comparable to the descriptions given by
persons who have in actuality experienced either true phobic states or
the panic and terror that arise during a psychotic episode. To clarify this
point, I will cite from descriptions given by persons who have lived
through neurotic phobic experiences.


An anonymous surgeon, who related his experience of an anxiety
state that was complicated by feelings of unreality and of depersonalization,
spoke of his anxiety and fear in the following way.


It is as difficult to describe to others what an acute anxiety state feels
like as to convey to the inexperienced the feeling of falling in love. Perhaps the
most characteristic impression is the constant state of causeless and apparently
meaningless alarm. You feel as if you were on the battlefield or had stumbled

[p. <i>242</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00258&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Note that this surgeon spoke of a feeling of an internal, pervasive
<i>alarm</i> which persisted, though he gave no outward evidence of the inner
turmoil. Notice also that he felt an inability to concentrate his thoughts
and that his sensory world seemed to be constantly changing.


Another description may be cited from the autobiography by
W. E. Leonard, <i>The Locomotive-God</i>. As its central theme, the book
deals with the nature of the author's phobia and his attempts to conquer
his phobic neurosis. One of the several descriptions of his agoraphobia
(fear of open places) which he tried to reconstruct, was as follows.


We start with a state of terror generated by past experience. The past experience
itself remains in the subconsciousness. At times this emotional effect
remains merely a diffused state of terror, in intensity running the whole scale
from vague anxiety to intensest feel of impending death; and the agonized
mind stands balked of any explanation whatever; except perhaps (as formerly
with me) that the state is a premonition of the organic breakup of death. The
bottom is knocked out of all security, as when, in an earthquake, chasms suddenly
open all about one ... except that in an earthquake the mind knows the
fact <i>earthquake</i>, and in my case, it once knew no fact at all. But oftenest the
subconscious experience in addition to terror generates in conciousness some
specific form under which the terror manifests itself, a form of course symbolically,
even literally, simulating the original experience. My central, dominating
phobia of distance is as good an illustration as one will find. But the
<i>form</i> of itself will lack adequate motivation for consciousness. So the mind
<i>feigns</i> motivation. And so friendly counselors ask, "What is there to be afraid of?"
-- and add to the grievous burden by laughter. (Leonard, 1939, pp. 320-321)


Leonard's descriptions of his phobic attacks always suggest the
implication that the phobic state itself resembled a seizure, a stoppage,
or a blank area in the stream of consciousness. The terror disturbed his
mental functions to such an extent that he seemed at times to recall little
of the outward manifestations.


As a contrast to these descriptions of neurotic phobias, I present the
following description of an extreme fear induced in an otherwise normal
young man. About a century ago, when chloroform was first used as a
surgical anesthetic, many introspective accounts detailing the resultant
experience of loss of and return to consciousness were published. Such
was the case of a certain university student whose account Herbert
Spencer later published. Part of this production reads as follows.

[p. <i>243</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00259&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began to be terrified to such a wonderful extent as I would never before
have guessed possible. I made an involuntary effort to get out of the
chair, and then--suddenly became aware that I was looking at nothing: while
taken up by the confusion in my lungs, the outward things in the room had
gone, and I was "alone in the dark." I felt a force on my arm ... keeping me
down, and this was the last straw which made me give in, the last definite
thing ... I remembered outside my own body. Instantly I was seized and
overwhelmed by the panic inside.... I could feel every air-cell struggling
spasmodically against an awful pressure. In their struggle they seemed to tear
away from one another in all directions, and there was universal racking torture,
while meantime the common foe, in the shape of this iron pressure, kept
settling down with more and more irresistible might into every nook and
crevice of the scene ... I recognized some different parts of my body, and
felt that the pain in one part was not the same as that in another.... A chaotic
roaring ran through my brain, innumerable drums began to beat far inside my
ear, till the confusion presently came to a monstrous thudding, every thud of
which wounded me like a club falling repeatedly on the same spot. (Spencer,
1878, pp. 555-556)


This description of an intense fear aroused in the student by the
chloroform-induced anesthesia while he was restrained in a dentist's
chair, demonstrates Peters' point that the normal man attacks the thing
(circumstances) he fears, whereas, as we have seen, the madman attacks
the fear itself. The student whose account I have just cited had the experience
of being slowly suffocated by the gas, so that he attempted
automatically to escape from the chair. He was acutely aware of the
various parts of his body, as well as of painful throbbing in each limb
and muscle; deep terror engulfed the entire situation, which terror he
could not control, so threatening was it to his life.


The acute anxiety of the surgeon and Leonard's phobic terror were
experiences by which each found himself possessed. Each had an inner
feeling for which he could not find or recognize an adequate stimulus.
Each man, including the student, was terrified, yet somehow knew that
his terror was essentially pointless and recognized it as such. The "feel"
of the fear was, so far as anyone can tell, of the same quality in all three
instances. The feeling muffled their ordinary thought processes, distorted
sensory and perceptual experience, and disrupted self-control. However,
only for the student was there a tangible basis for the fear; for the
surgeon and for Leonard, none was known.


<i>The Role of Fear in Neuroses</i>


It has been intimated in previous chapters that a valid psychological
distinction may be made between the psychopathology of neurosis
and that of psychosis. This distinction is partly a matter of both the intensity
and the quality of the disturbance. In addition, the distinction

[p. <i>244</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00260&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a rule, <i>neurotic fear</i> begins rather early in the life of the individual.
The neurotic patient usually states that the first panic or terror
episode occurred during childhood and that episodes or "spells" of the
same senseless panic states have occurred from time to time ever since.
A confession was published by an anonymous patient, "Vincent," telling
of his agoraphobia, from which he had suffered throughout most of his
life.


I am now in mid-life and I have not seen a well day since I was about
twelve years of age. Before I experienced any of the symptoms of agoraphobia
I recall that a strange affliction came over me, an affliction that seemed to baffle
the country doctors who were consulted. I was taken suddenly with "spells"
which lasted about thirty minutes. During these attacks I was entirely conscious
and rational. As I remember the affliction ... a sort of "coldness" that
produced a very unusual sensation, or perhaps a <i>lack</i> of sensation would describe
it more accurately.... When my strange illness came upon me, I worried
over it, fearing that I should die in one of the attacks....


There was a high hill not far from my home in the country where we
boys used to coast in the winter time. One evening while coasting, in company
with other boys of the neighborhood, I experienced an uncomfortable feeling
each time we returned to the top of the hill. It was not a well defined symptom
of this horrible (I use the term deliberately) malady, but later experiences
have taught me that it possessed the unmistakable earmarks. As the months
went by the symptoms developed, with the result that I avoided hill-tops, so
far as possible. Later, perhaps a year or so, I commenced having a dread of
wide fields, especially when the fields consisted of pasture land and were level,
with the grass cropped short like the grass on a well-kept lawn. I likewise commenced
to dread high things, and especially to ascend anything high. I even
had a fear of crowds of people, and later of wide streets and parks... But
the one thing that I would make plain is that the malady is always present...
I am conscious of it ... during every hour that I am awake. The fear, intensified,
that comes over me while crossing a wide street is, it seems to me, an
outcropping of a permanent condition ... When I think of the agony which I
have experienced for many years I am astounded at the endurance of the human
spirit. (Anon., 1919, pp. 295-299)


"Vincent" mentioned elsewhere in this confession that he was in
good physical health so that he had never been rejected when applying
for the purchase of life insurance. He had not consulted a physician concerning
his phobia since he had left his parents' home at the age of
eighteen. In brief, he apparently dwelt in a state of constant anxiety
marked by spells of terror and panic, for which he was unable to discover

[p. <i>245</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00261&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another somewhat more detailed account of a phobia was written
by Mrs. F. H. in the form of autobiographical notes that she sent to a
physician-friend, Dr. Earl Bond, whom she had consulted professionally
some twenty years before. Mrs. F. H. had received psychotherapeutic
treatment from several reputable physicians and had a record of several
stays in clinics and hospitals. Her phobia centered on the act of going out-of-doors
into full daylight. Mrs. F. H. wrote an extensive account of her
fifty years of terror, when at long last, through her own self-analysis, she
considered that she had conquered and put an end to her phobia. The
following is a condensation from her notes, which provides some knowledge
of the nature of the fear she had experienced, as well as the selfestablished
routine she followed in her attempt to gain control over her
phobia.


For many years I had been burdened by fears which prevented me
from going about in the daytime, and which continually kept me in a state of
anxiety so severe as, often, to practically paralyze me for hours as I lay
racked and tortured on my couch...


My phobias were concerned with a good many things, but the central
one, the core of them, was an abject fear of light. This fear was so overpowering
that I darted out into the daylight only to be driven back, as if by an Unseen
Force, into the darkened room where I could find a comparative peace
and feeling of safety, although even there I had to fight off periods of intense
fear ... [which sprang up] like jack-in-the-boxes ...


But one day, suddenly, without warning, a blob of buried stuff cut itself
loose from its moorings in the hinterland of my unconscious, and came out into
the open. What I saw, I saw clearly, and <i>without fear</i>. In the days that followed,
I took counsel widi myself and argued that if a certain part of the
content of my unconscious had broken out of its Pandora's box, then it was
possible for more to be discovered. So I decided to get along with the job of
trying to track down the horrid "appearances" which troubled me, to find out
what they were ,and to rid myself of them. It was a challenge that I had to
accept, and I accepted it....


Since walking alone in broad daylight was my worst hazard, I set myself
the task of going out every day in order to bring up my fears in all their
might. For many years it had been impossible to walk farther than a square
in daylight, for my mind would get into such a state of fuzziness that it was
not safe for me to be abroad alone in the streets of a city ...


I [now] found that the fear of not being able to get home was also one
of my most terrible fears. It seemed that there was something which interposed
between my home and me; not being able to get back had an element
of fatefulness ...


It was what light might reveal that stirred up a sense of horror in me,
the horror of the things that were hiding in the corners and culs-de-sac of my
mind. Light was the Great Revealer; in the manner of a giant searchlight, it

[p. <i>246</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00262&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For several days, I walked abroad as one entranced, with the same words
beating upon my inner ear: "You will have to go on forever and ever! You
will have to wander the face of the earth like a lost soul"--the first theme with
variations, yet even more fearful. There were other ideas that came to mind
as I tried to push through to the meaning which eluded me. One day I was
afraid that a spell had been put upon me, that I would turn into something
not myself, a lower animal, or would be transported to the underground
garden of the Old Witch where people became partly human with heads of
wolves or jackals, as in fairy tales. But even more frightening was the thought
that I might turn into a ghoul.... Thus my rampant unconscious, once the
lid was off, led me into the very heart of a country where bleak fear reigned supreme ...
My fear of not getting home meant that something I had done, or
thought I had done, was separating me from "the place where love is"; something
sinful and forbidden was preventing me from being able to get home....


And then, one day I automatically slipped into what felt like an almost
hypnotic state from the moment I left my door. I fell into a slow, rhythmic
gait without meaning to do so. I felt that I was wearing a fixed stare, a look
of utter vacuity.... As I proceeded, the feeling grew. I felt controlled by an
unseen force, by something quite outside myself. That I was scared is putting
it mildly; I felt as if I were possessed ... [but] once home the [panic] ended.


After about a week of peace, I suddenly ran into a veritable whirlwind of
a panic. I was walking in a near-by square, when all at once I felt I was in
imminent danger. So poignant was this feeling which gathered force by the
second, that I almost cried out, "Save me! Save me!." ... In this experience,
unlike most of my experiences, I was unable to see beneath the surface of my
fear. The sheer terror of it was almost paralyzing. How I ever arrived at my
apartment, I will never know, but within its safety I brought up the whole
fantasy....


As to this feeling of utter unworthiness, I know that all neurotics believe,
when the neurosis is upon them, that each one of them is, in fact, the wickedest
person in the world. They are blind, for the duration, to the fact that the world
is full of real offenders who are going about their business unperturbed and
imperturbable.... Throughout the period of my neurotic illness, this idea
weaves in and out; and the intense craving I had to get back to the halcyon
days before the fall was manifest in the fear that I would never get back
home, and in the seeking of someone who would fulfill the prerequisites of a
mother or father surrogate. Thus when I found myself surrounded by strangers,
with no means of escape, I was thrown into a panic....


I wanted, frantically, to run away as fast as possible. In interpreting my
own fear ... I discovered a concealed wish to return to a non-moral state in
which our time-encrusted mores would no longer operate, and one could become
an uncivilized being again.... I have often wondered how many
others have felt such urges translated in fear of places remote from humankind ...
This brings me to the end of my story. I managed to come out into
the light unafraid. I was able to take up my life again without crippling fears.
(Anon., 1952, pp. 162-176)

[p. <i>247</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00263&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mrs. F. H. was a writer. She had gained her vocabulary and background
of psychological reference from the several psychoanalytical
therapists who had treated her. I mention these points so that the reader
may more clearly understand the reason for the phraseology she used so
freely. Her self-analysis finally led her to recall an incident that had
happened when she was four years old. A baby sister had been born of
whom she disapproved and she had innocently suggested to her parents
that the sister should be drowned by her father, as she had seen him do
to a litter of kittens. Because of this childish remark she was not only
spanked and called a murderer, but she was also partially ostracized by
her parents. Her self-analysis indicated that this childish incident, magnified
by the stern parental behavior, had terrified her and filled her with
guilt feelings, so that she dared not face the light of day or go out-of-doors,
lest others might also call her a murderer. It is interesting to note
how the terror gradually became generalized and attached to other ideas
that interfered with her attempts to break through the barriers the phobia
had imposed. Mrs. F. H.'s history is one of the very few autobiographical
accounts of a phobic state I have found in which the sufferer considered
the phobia to have disappeared and her recovery to be complete. How
long the recovery continued and how complete it really was, cannot be
told from her report.


I cited a few pages back an excerpt from W. E. Leonard's autobiographical
book, <i>The Locomotive-God</i>, which deals largely with his
practically lifelong phobia. His graphic descriptions of various aspects of
his phobic experiences are illuminating and interesting. The following
series of excerpts from his book will provide further information. For
example, he described a typical phobic seizure as follows.


Well, here is what happens always. First, the seizure happens--as well
say, nothing happens, if a red-hot-iron is run down the throat, even though it
should miraculously leave no after-effects. The seizure happens; the acutest
agony of the conscious brain happens. Second, the seizure leaves me always far
more exposed to phobic seizures for weeks or months; increases my fear of the
Fear; and, as in the distance-phobia, robs me of a goodly part of what little
freedom of movement on street and hillside as I have....


[In another connection he characterized a phobic seizure which occurred
during his childhood:] The alien spell that had seized me [before] seizes me
again. I recognize it for the same. I think, "That passed, this will." But it does
not pass. It surges with an indescribable intensity of Horror. Home again becomes
immeasurable distance, only more immeasurable. And the distance of
three blocks to the railway-bridge girders is, I feel, an infinity of street in the
sun. I totter. I fly. I open my shirt to get air on my bare chest. There is a
white hitching-post by the gutter near the end of the block. My imagination
creates that as its goal, as its refuge. If I can get to the hitching-post, I am
saved. I get to the hitching-post. There is a pile of bricks on the tree-lawn

[p. <i>248</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00264&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

[He described some of the more common physical components of his
panic state in the following terms:] In my seizures I sometimes feel faint but
never faint away. I never have shrieked but once--as I stood on the bluff before
the vision--and then I was shrieking for specific help; I become white in the
face and speak (if another is with me) with a very agitated plaintive quiet,
like a dying man who is trying not to make a fuss about it. I never have nausea
or any other disturbance of the digestive tract; and headaches or other nervous
disturbances follow only rarely.... One other was a nervous dread that I
was about ready to fall down. One other still was the sensation of <i>retching</i> ...
that I had to make the best of during many hours....


[He contrasted his childhood panics to his adult phobias:] The [adult]
phobic phenomena were not simply infantile clinging to parents and house.
The central terror--craving for safety, reducible ultimately to the fear of death
--spread over my entire consciousness, over my whole environment. Every
fear known to timid childhood was mine--fear of darkness, of thunder-storms,
of dogs, of bodily pains, of blood. And many fears that only maturity has the
knowledge to fabricate--as of symptoms of imagined diseases. The hideous
components of this three months nightmare ... thereafter mitigated but never
entirely eliminated from the abiding core of the distance-phobia ... were of
diverse origins....


My mind found diabolically cunning ways of rationalizing all my [adult]
terrors into secondary forms, pseudo-explanations, as plausible as horrific. For,
not having the true explanation, the reason still insisted by its own instinctive
urge upon some explanation. So it was with the innumerable phobias that beset
me. Such is the mechanism in phobias generally, I believe. The real causes are
unknown to the sufferer; and he makes up his causes. If he is of low intelligence,
he makes up palpably foolish causes; if he is of high, then more
plausible causes. Let us say both have a phobia of darkness; in both the real
cause is forgotten childhood trauma, from a fright in a wood; the former will
explain it as fear lest some goblin thrust out a white hand from the blackness;
the latter as a fear that some disease may attack him, appendicitis or spasm,
with no one near to help in the night. (Leonard, 1939, pp. 322-323; 64;
421-422; 317; 320)


It is evident from these excerpts that Leonard was an intelligent and
gifted man who unfortunately had been, and continued to be, greatly
handicapped by his phobias. He repeatedly had recourse to medical and
psychiatric advice and treatment. He read very widely concerning the
phenomena and theories of psychotherapy. He made several determined
attempts to solve his problems, both with the help of therapists and
through self-analysis. He finally came to believe that his original terror
dated back to an occasion when he had, as a young child, stood close to
a locomotive as it entered a railway station. The sights and sounds

[p. <i>249</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00265&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another aspect of everyday life experience that may become linked
to neurotic phobic phenomena is the way in which such phobias frequently
affect the professional career of the afflicted person. The following
extract, written by one of Dr. Clevenger's patients, describes the
effect of his phobia on his career.


The detriment that this malady has been to me, aside from the physical
and mental distress, has been almost incalculable. It has throttled all ambition,
killed all personal pride, spoiled every pleasure. To my acquaintances I have
been a veritable puzzle. A thing of this kind, cannot, of course, be explained to
every individual who may chance to notice my idiosyncrasies. One cannot wear
his heart upon his sleeve all the time, and with a few exceptions I have never
attempted to make people understand what the trouble was, for I realize
how hopeless the task of making them comprehend the matter sufficiently to
enlist their sympathy. Most people with whom I have been brought into contact
have called me a "crank," and intimated that I was irremediably crazy.
Others have insinuated that the memory of some dark crime committed in
early life, was the cause of these personal peculiarities. Others still have attributed
it all to natural indolence and a desire to shirk work and the ordinary
duties of life. Perhaps they are all right; perhaps all wrong--I merely know
that it has ruined all my prospects in life, and that, endowed by nature with
a mind more than usually quick and retentive, I find myself now, at an age
when the opportunities of youth have pretty well slipped by, forced to contemplate
a future which bears no prospect of pleasure or profit. (Clevenger,
1890, p. 540)


The author of this statement has clearly pointed out the way in
which a persistent and recurrent phobia may act as a most effective handicap
in normal life activities. The spells of terror amount to a form of
inexplicable self-torture which in varying degrees often continues throughout
a lifetime. The limitation in activity, the lack of any understanding
or sympathy from others, the inner conviction that the fear is "senseless,"
all combine to produce an irritating and pervasive pessimism that on
occasion leads to suicidal attempts. The problem seems much too simple
to the onlooker who says, "It's all in your imagination. Snap out of it.
Use your self-control." The neurotic individual has discovered long ago
that such observations and well-meant advice are of no assistance whatsoever.
Even more discouraging is the fact that he has very frequently
found that long, tedious, torturing efforts at psychotherapy likewise fail
to bring him relief. Neurotic phobias, of varying degrees of intensity, are
not uncommon in the general population; they do account for much loss
of human health and happiness.

<i>Fear in the Psychotic States</i>


Concerning the qualitative manifestations of the emotion of fear
itself, there seems to be little difference between its nature in neurosis and
psychosis. The overwhelming, pervasive, distracting turmoil of the phobic
neurotic differs from that of the melancholic or paranoid patient mainly
in terms of the insight or meaning the sufferer attaches to his inner feelings.
This observation does not mean that neurosis and psychosis are
nothing more than manifestations of the same pathological process, any
more than an elevated body temperature could be taken as evidence that
typhus and tuberculosis have the same pathological basis.


Peters made an important observation in his comment on the role
played by fear at the onset of his psychosis. Note that, in this description
of a state of fear, part of the difference from those previously cited rests
in the expression of a feeling of unreality.


The warning in the trees, their branches twisting against the coming of
the night ... is already too late.... Fear comes suddenly, chilling and shocking.
But in this there is no bold stroke, only the slow preparation of terror.
What child has looked upon his first complete day and not felt the slow agony
of nightfall wresting it from him? With it come uncertainty and new shadows
--shadows with movements and hidden life, the life of the small nighttime
enemies: rodents, insects, marauders, and ... and what? The sounds and
movements of people are contained and stifled, the cry of alarm dies in
the throat of a victim, the child looks quickly over a shoulder for what is not
there, and the gesture is stealthy, ill. (Peters, 1949, pp. 1-2)


Fear had crept into the mind of this psychotic patient, fear accompanied
by feelings of the weird and unreal--a world of unreal evil
that terrified him. For the neurotic patient, the phobia constituted a
sudden spell or seizure, only rarely described as unreal or evil. The
psychotic patient, on the other hand, finds himself in a world of magical
or unreal fear that has overwhelmed him slowly and that he may be convinced
will eventually destroy him.


Lenore McCall's comments on the part played by fear during her
four-year period of melancholia supply further illustrative material.


There is no emotion in life more paralyzing than fear, no element more
devastating. It is the archenemy of man and from the time [my illness started]
until I recovered it was my constant companion. I learned to know it in all
its aspects, real and imaginary, and as it stalked my footsteps I did not have to
look back to be aware of its presence for its heavy, chill hand was always on
my shoulder.


Beside that foreboding figure there walked another in due time, a kinsman
of the first, betraying their relationship by many mutual characteristics;
at times so similar that their identities were merged. The name of the second
companion of my descent into the unknown was horror. I grew to know it as

[p. <i>251</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00267&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My fear was based fundamentally upon a terror of myself, of what was
happening to me, of the helplessness which was overpowering my faculties,
and it manifested itself first in a mounting fear of everything about me. I began
to be afraid of people, of my family and my friends; not because of what they
represented, I soon learned, but because of my own inability to cope with
ordinary human contacts. The world which others inhabited, and to which I
rightly belonged, was becoming unreal to me and I felt myself an alien as I
trudged farther and farther into weird and unknown terrain. (McCall, 1947,
p. 8)


This description was particularly related to the days and weeks of
the beginning of her depression. But the same fear and horror accompanied
her through all the years of her illness. As she experienced it, her
fear seemed to stem out of her inability to cope with her own everyday
life, with its duties and responsibilities. She could not think clearly or
consecutively. Whether her inadequacy was due to the feelings of fear,
or whether the fear was secondary to her inadequacies, is impossible to
say; either way, the end result remained the same.


This description of fear in a case of melancholia may be compared
to the fears of a patient who had suffered from episodes of both mania
and depression. We allude to Custance, who suffered from both manic and
depressive episodes, and who wrote most of his account while he was in
the process of recovering from a maniacal state. The manic states he
characterized as "Universes of Bliss" and made no reference to fear. But
concerning the role that fear played during his episodes of depression
(Universes of Horror), he wrote as follows.


I lay in my bed in the ward of the Hospital dominated above all by an
overpowering sense of fear. At first I did not know exactly what it was that I
feared, except of course that my mind, which I strove as hard as I could to
keep blank, would insist on working about the ordinary, human fears ...
Wisely, no attempt was made to get me up, and I lay as motionless as I could,
covering my head as a rule with the bedclothes, partly to shut out the
sights and sounds of the ward, and partly as a sort of instinctive reaction....


I had reached [finally] the extremity of fear. Paroxysms of terror overcame
me, and I nearly jumped straight out of the window with the idea of
killing myself with the broken glass. But the fit passed, and looking back I
date my improvement and subsequent recovery from that moment.... My
soul had plumbed the lowest depth.... Although for months ... my mind
went on revolving in the same channels of fear and despair, the weight of the
anticipated horror and pain seemed to be lifted, to recede as it were. (Custance,
1952, pp. 64; 75)


In the case of Custance, the paralyzing fear and horror of depression
gave rise to suicidal tendencies. Fear in depressive states is

[p. <i>252</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00268&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In several previous chapters I have availed myself of excerpts from
the <i>Autobiography of a Schizophrenic Girl</i>. It will be recalled that
Renee's earliest complaints were based on a sharp feeling of unreality and
of perceptual distortions that waxed and waned from time to time after
the age of five. During her adolescence she developed active tuberculosis
and was hospitalized in a mountain sanatorium. Both her physical
and mental health improved during the hospital stay so that she was able
to return to her parents' home.


It was New Year's when I first experienced what I called <i>Fear</i>. It literally
fell on me, how I know not.... Suddenly Fear, agonizing, boundless Fear,
overcame me, not the usual uneasiness of unreality, but real fear, such as one
knows at the approach of danger, of calamity.... I remained unaware of the
basis for the fear which from then on came over me at any moment of the
day....


During the earliest attacks of Fear and intense unreality, I sometimes
uttered these ... words: "I should prefer to escape into madness to avoid this
consuming fear." Alas, I did not know what I was saying. In my ignorance I
believed that madness was a state of insensibility ... [and] no responsibility.
Never ... had I even imagined what "to lose one's reason" actually meant....


In the endless silence and the strained immobility, I had the impression
that some dreadful thing about to occur would break the quiet, something
horrible, overwhelming. I waited, holding my breath, suffused with inquietude;
but nothing happened. The immobility became more immobile, the silence
more silent, things and people, their gestures and their noises, more artificial,
detached one from the other, unreal, without life. And my fear increased, became
inexpressible, shattering, intolerable. (Sechehaye, 1951, pp. 13-14; 23;
25)


The experience of sudden overwhelming fear and unreality that
Renee described is not an uncommon occurrence in schizophrenia. The
usual account given by schizophrenic patients includes an initial state of
mental confusion, then a complex web of feelings of unreality and great
fearfulness. The idea which very soon rose in Renee's mind--that madness
would be an excellent defense against the fear and unreality--is an interesting
one. The wish to seek this "defense," however, indicated the
lack of realization that she had already "lost her mind." The intense fear
and loss of contact with reality gradually overwhelmed her until her
"defense" became a catatonic rigidity, since this permitted her to block
out from awareness almost all external sensory stimulation. Yet, as one
may suspect, her fearful state persisted in spite of the catatonic defenses.


The role played by fear in many instances of mental disturbances
was neatly summarized by a patient at the Utica State Asylum in a

[p. <i>253</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00269&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Practical Insanity, Proteus-like, assumes a variety of forms, but its principal
phase is fear. Fear is its presiding deity: the fear of death in some terrible
shape. This apprehension is riveted in the minds of the insane, and underlies
the disposition to commit suicide, although suicidal intentions are ofttimes
to be traced to a desire to rid one's self of the world and the world of one's
self.--"The spirit of man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who
can bear?"


I speak the truth in a mystery; I knew a man--whether in the body or
out of it he could not tell, at entering this retreat, to suffer, in imagination,
all the horrors and tortures of the damned,--apprehensions of violence, of a
horrible end,--proneness to commit suicide,--compassed with an everlasting
chain of plots, plotters, and counter-plots, loud menaces and whispers murdering
sleep; mine eyes have seen it, mine ears have heard it, and the half is not
revealed. (Anon., 1856b, p. 75)


Only very rarely do depressive or schizophrenic experiences occur
without including a large element of fear, and most frequently one or
another form of fear constitutes the major disabling component. The
experience of fear or of feelings akin to fear usually involves large elements
of anticipation of the future, in which death, disease, and disaster
constitute the storm center of the fear. Since a large part of the mental
content of a psychosis becomes a distorted connection to present and
past reality, the fear is all the more unbearable. The patient cannot easily
or with any sense of certainty, associated with his past, experience a
reasonable future for himself. Everyone recognizes the inevitability of
death, yet the actual thought of death is almost universally blocked out
of the ordinary human mind by a multitude of suppressive devices. When
psychosis or neurosis intervenes, the suppressive devices fail.


<i>Fear Mixed with Other Emotions</i>


Fear--pure fear--is a rare experience. Fear is usually blended with
other emotional states, such as unreality, curiosity, anger, or reverence,
or it is so bound to its circumstantial context that the situation itself
designates the feeling. For example, <i>terror</i> is fear of impending destruction,
whereas <i>guilt</i> is fear of possible punishment. Dr. Oliver phrased it
as follows.


Fear has torment, we all know that. But fear ... is intimately connected
with punishment; it is, in a sense, its own punishment. It carries, inevitably,
its own curse with it.... Fear results in a sort of checking of the
mind, in inhibitions; that it brings with it its own special punishment or curse.
(Oliver, 1928, pp. 248-249)

[p. <i>254</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00270&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is for these complex, blended, fearful states that both the experiencer
and the onlooker find difficulty in securing adequate labeling
words. For example, a woman who was undergoing psychoanalytic treatment
with I. P. Glauber developed peculiar panic states. She reported
her feelings during one of these attacks as follows.


The frantic panic occurs when I feel I must continue, go on and on. I
must feel that there is a definite termination of my working in view. There is a
feeling of panic, palpitation, blinding. It actually blurs my vision and my head
feels closed in and smaller when I am near a person for whom I feel aggression,
and at the same time, a feeling of clinging.... She mustn't leave me--but I
must have the power to leave her. This is true of men as well--anyone upon
whom I depend for a feeling of belonging. I feel real only when I'm close to
someone--actually kissing them or holding their eyes with mine. But at the
same time I want to run away for fear they will leave me first and I'll be
alone, proven worthless, unlovable.... I hate them for seeing me as I am
--and playing on it. It seems torturous to me. I fear working in the office and
I fear not working; it all seems outside of myself. I'm all walled in within myself
and I must fight my way out--groping to belong to reality. (Glauber,
1949, pp. 76-77)


She spoke of the feeling as one of over-all panic, yet there is a mixture
of feelings of hate, dependence, love, unreality, and depersonalization,
together with some perceptual distortions. Strong fear was probably
the essential component in her agitated state, yet it was not the only
disturbance or her main symptomatic complaint.


In a reply to a question asked by Morton Prince, "What is your
mental state? Anxiety, curiosity, or what?" another phobic patient described
her panic state as follows.


Trying to look into the mysteries of the world, as to what air is and the
planets, and that sort of thing. In other words, it comes to me now that it is
largely trying to investigate and not succeeding, and from the fact that I do
not succeed it makes mental conflict. It is this way: I try to find out what something
is like, so to speak, and I cannot find out what air, for instance, is like,
and because I cannot give myself a satisfactory definition or answer it makes
conflict. I see now quite clearly certain things. It has come to me that what it
is is more or less of a temper fit, as if you were very angry and wanted to strike
someone and you do not strike him. It is the same way about this. I want to
feel the air and I cannot, and it is a mild temper fit. I do not think it really
is anger. It is <i>annoyance</i>, irritation. In other words, it is trying to do something
that you cannot. I have since had repeated attacks of the same kind of unreality,
but <i>they never frightened me</i>, only annoyed me. First it is a feeling of
<i>annoyance</i>, later, in the major attacks, comes the panic. (Prince, 1912, pp.
263-264)


In this instance the panic or groundless fear was said to be secondary
to an anger, annoyance, and sense of unreality that of themselves did

Another way in which fear, fatigue, and pain may intermix to
produce a state that actually disables the person was recounted by
Margaret Cleaves, a practicing physician, in her <i>Autobiography of a
Neurasthene</i>.


I began to feel very strangely, but I relaxed none of my effort in bringing
my work to completion. Finally there came to me a sense of dread and
terror beyond my comprehension. My eyes caught the muscles of my colorless
hands quivering one day similarly it seemed to me as the fibrillary contraction
of a progressive muscular atrophy. I was saturated with the atmosphere of
organic nerve conditions clinically as well as in the work I had been doing.
It struck terror to my heart despite the fact that I had often been so worn as
to have other muscles quiver, but I never before had known the strange incomprehensible
feeling of desolation and danger....


[After several weeks she went on a vacation but gained no real relief.
Subsequently, hoping that a real change of scene would benefit her, she went
to France where she rented a cottage. Of this she wrote:]


I was utterly unprepared for the sensations I experienced immediately
I was within its four enclosing walls. It was one of nameless horror, a feeling as
though they were crowding in upon me with crushing force not only upon
every side, but from above as well. I never was, nor am I in the habit of giving
up when I undertake to do a thing. I felt as though I could not remain long
enough to attain my purpose, but I tried the old trick of setting my teeth together
and saying "I will." It was no use. The sense of dread, horror and impending
danger of what I knew not, as well as the increasing helplessness of my
right leg was so great that I turned to the door and fled incontinently. (Cleaves,
1910, pp. 60; 107-108)


According to her account, Dr. Cleaves had been a hypochondriac
since childhood, but had always been able to drive herself to accomplish
any task, no matter what her physical complaints may have been. The
incidents that are cited happened on occasions when her inner emotional
turmoil overwhelmed her volitional strength. At the time of the first of
these incidents, she said, she was filled with a feeling of dread, terror,
and desolation in which fear seems to have been the core. During the
second incident the fear was certainly in ascendency, to such an extent
that the phobia of closed places blotted out all her usual devices for
exercising conscious voluntary control.

[p. <i>256</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00272&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Fear and Sex</i>


Psychoanalytic theory, which has dominated psychiatric thought for
the past quarter century or more, holds that psychopathology is essentially
a breaking through into conscious life of the disguised energy and
affect of repressed instinctive sexuality. This theory was commented on
at some length by Leonard in relation to his own phobia.


This [theory] for a time convinced me that the phobia was somehow
rooted in sex; while, on the other hand, the phobic seizures in their analyzable
emotion were so damnably obvious as expressions of the self-preservation instinct,
I vacillated for years between sex and self-preservation as the leitmotif.
... But all observations for eleven years had got me nowhere. And all the
explanations of amateur or professional psychologists and neurologists in the
vicinity had got me nowhere, being inconsistent or superficial, or frankly tentative.
And all my varying technic of cure had got me nowhere....


[His first wife committed suicide. This tragedy made his agoraphobia
more acute and circumscribing. Four years after the suicide he remarried.
Of the second marriage he wrote as follows.]


This most private experience may still be considered scientifically as one
more experiment in phobic phenomena. And it shows: (1) that suddenly
breaking phobic bondage ... may not really break it at all; (2) that even
a half-hour's entire release from phobic emotion under conditions where
otherwise most intense [feelings dominate] ... presages no inevitable cure;
(3) that in changing the environment <i>I carried with me</i> essentially unchanged
(except for reduction of intensity, itself due to another stimulus and another
support) the characteristic phobic need of a center of safety; (4) that the
love-stimulus, helpful beyond any other, was itself only peripheral to the
trouble. And the next twelve years show that even the stimulus of marriage
and a new home could not withstand the phobias, least of all under any
worries and any emotional stress ... and there can be no twelve years on
earth without these, even where without phobias. (Leonard, 1939, pp. 390;
349)


From Leonard's experience, as well as from other similar reports,
it becomes apparent that fear and phobia are much stronger emotional
drives than either love or sex. A spouse may provide a haven of comparative
security, but only for short intervals since the shelter of marriage
in no way mitigates or cures the fundamental fearfulness. Dr. Oliver
commented on this point in the following way.


People trifle with love. Now I deny that love is a strong passion. Fear is
the strong passion. (Oliver, 1928, p. 121)


It is indeed astonishing to discover the number of autobiographical
accounts one can find in the literature where the sufferers, particularly
those patients who have lived through full-blown psychoses or neuroses,
question the relevancy of repressed sexuality to the core of their psychopathology.

[p. <i>257</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00273&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Fear During Heart Disease</i>


It is an ancient medical observation that certain patients who suffer
from one or another of the various forms of heart disease undergo, at
intervals, periods of panic or of melancholia. One such patient, Mrs.
Pastorelli, who had suffered panic attacks in connection with her heart
disease, wrote about the experience as follows.


Is there really nothing which can prevent me feeling my heart--that
vital machine whose slightest deviation from the normal is enough to upset the
entire body--suddenly give out, get painfully irregular, to be thrown for hours
into an unimaginable state of crazy fear, while at the same time the lungs
seem to be turned into cotton-wool which lets no air pass, and in a few
moments a glacial cold, such as I have never experienced at any other time,
penetrates the whole of my being and turns it into a block of ice? Shall I then
always be liable to those states of collapse when, in indescribable agony, gasping
and feeling death imminent, I find myself as incapable of resistance or
defence as a plant whose stalk is suddenly cut? (Pastorelli, 1936, pp. 32-33)


A panic of this kind may seem "reasonable" to the onlooker, who
must, however, understand that it is subjectively determined by the objectively
imminent possibility of sudden death. Fear may be very acute in
a variety of situations and conditions, but it always seems more tolerable
when an objective explanation is at hand.


<b>DISCUSSION</b>


Surveying in a more general way these autobiographical accounts
of pathological fear and of phobia bring several points into clearer light.
<i>Fear is the strong passion</i>. In the presence of great fear all other feelings,
emotions, intellectual barriers, and volitional efforts collapse. All interest
and motivations based on hunger, thirst, or sex become ineffective. All
of mankind's intellectual defenses, such as turning one's thoughts to
other subjects, attempting to divert the feeling of fear from consciousness,
efforts based on the premise, "I've always been master of my own mind";
all these vanish in the face of great fear. Fear is all-pervasive and all-powerful.
It blots out hope. It destroys inhibitions. It cannot be denied.
It is beyond bravery and cowardice. It distorts all the usual orderly
mental processes, eventually erasing both memory and conscious existence.


When in the throes of fear the sufferer seeks a "center of safety"; or
when such refuge does exist, he strives to "huddle in a corner," waiting
in despair till the paroxysm passes. While the paroxysm of terror continues,
the person is unable to question or consider its possible causes. But
once the phase of acute terror has waned, there still lingers in its wake a
dread or horror, from which he occasionally may attempt a self-explanation.
The dread--the horror--continues essentially unchanged because

[p. <i>258</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697828-I00274&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In many ways, an overwhelming state of panic is similar to an
epileptic seizure. It happens. One does not know why. One tries to avoid,
insofar as possible, the various attendant circumstances that immediately
preceded and seemingly led to the more recent attacks. One finds oneself
inevitably forced to believe that fear is inflicted from without, or born
from some inner and totally involuntary mechanism. The panic is frequently
accompanied by a feeling of injustice, since one can conceive of
no possible reason for having to endure such an affliction, from which
most of one's fellows appear to be free. "Why has the Lord afflicted me?"
is the common complaint of both the phobic and the epileptic sufferer.


Phobia, like melancholia, is regarded as an overwhelmingly real
experience by each phobic patient. The feeling of a specific avoidance
may be illogical, so far as the surrounding circumstances are concerned,
but he cannot escape the certainty of its presence. Others may tell him
that his fear, his phobia, his panic, is silly and nonsensical, that it is
strictly imaginary, and that he should exercise his will power and rise
above it. He may agree with these suggestions, but only on an intellectual
level, for he has repeatedly found that his conscious efforts do not
modify or banish the pervasive and demanding inner experience.


The comparison between the phobic experience of the neurotic
patient and that of the psychotic patient is an interesting one. In all
likelihood, the fear itself is qualitatively similar in both conditions. But
the reactions to the emotional experience do differ. The neurotic is overwhelmed
and disabled, yet retains sufficient mental integration to maintain
his capacity to adjust, in one way or another, to most situations of
everyday life. He realizes his handicap and lives with it as best he can.
The psychotic patient, however, is gripped by terror in addition to being
in a state of melancholia, mental turmoil and confusion, and so forth, all
together precluding even partial adjustment to the outer environment.

Many psychotic and neurotic patients arrive at the conclusion that
their fear is basically a fear of death, that somehow the innate terror
which every person feels of his own inevitable death has broken loose and
overwhelms them. But why in him, rather than in any other person
should fear break loose; such is the question for which each patient seeks
to find an answer.
