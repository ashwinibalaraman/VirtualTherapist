When boarding the <i>West Point</i> we were impressed by the
language of the sailors; in the course of our trip we began using
some of their terms. Our corpsmen began to speak of "mess"
instead of "chow." The floor of our cabins became "the deck."
The term "scuttlebutt" intrigued us, and later on New Guinea
the numerous rumors were always referred to as "scuttlebutts."
It was difficult to ascertain which were true; the surprising aspect
was that most reports later proved so.


Our hospital unit was stirred from lethargy on May 1st by
the rumor that we were alerted for transfer to a combat zone.
We discussed the news over our morning coffee. To state that
we ruminated with avidity is no exaggeration. The 37th Field
Hospital was assigned to the Sixth Army, commanded by General
Alvin Krueger. Officers of the Sixth Army inspected our
hospital. They informed us that we would be assigned to a
task force, and the staging was planned at Finschhafen.


The next month, it appeared, would be the most interesting
period of our army careers. We would finally utilize all the
training of the preceding two years. The medical corpsmen
had been trained and retrained, using simply a lecture system.
They were anxious to begin practical work. We felt that we
were needed in the forward area; we were restless to move up.


That night I lay awake for a long period entertaining random
thoughts about this World War and about the immediate future.
The southern skies were more beautiful than ever before
on this clear night. The stars and nebulae of the Milky Way
were brighter than usual; the Milky Way appeared as if someone

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another piece of news intrigued us and caused us to speculate
that we might soon begin the great offensives which would bring
peace to the Far East. Persistent rumors in May, 1944 were
that our armies would be in the Philippines at Christmas. It
did not seem possible. We regarded the Philippines as impregnable
to a sea attack before Japanese bases were softened by
bombings from China. Future campaigns involving the Celebes,
Java, Sumatra and other sector of the Malay Archipelago
seemed necessary to cut Japan off from supplies of tin and
rubber. And it appeared that we must have bases in this area
in order to get a foothold in China reasonably closes to the
Philippine Islands.


We were soon to leave the Milne Bay area, so a trip into
the China Straits to the small island Samarai was planned. We
took off early in the morning of May 10th on a launch and
an L.C.M. boat to visit the mission at Samarai; we were told
it was an interesting experiment in education of the natives.
It took almost four hours to arrive at our destination. Finally
we found the mission; it is about two miles from the village
called Samarai. This village is planted high on a mountainous
island overlooking a cove. We immediately had our lunch, consisting

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mr. Abel was a tall, sensitive Australian, about forty years
old. The mission had been established by his parents in 1890
and he was born there. At that date this area was populated by
headhunters. The island was described well in the book <i>Headhunting
in the Solomons</i>. The elder Abels taught the barbaric
women to sew and weave and the men were instructed in carpentry.
Christianity was introduced, and in 1924 construction
of the church was begun. It was not completed in 1944. The
architecture of the church was excellent and evidenced painful,
fine construction work. The finer decorative woods in the interior
required fourteen years in preparation and carving.


The home of the Abels had remained fifty-four years with
little change; it was the most comfortable and inviting spot we
had seen for several months. The house was built around a central
roofed patio and had a spacious glass enclosed porch.
There were many overstuffed and wicker chairs littered about
on the veranda; woven mats were distributed at random. On
the side tables were small statuettes, handiwork of the natives.
Planted along this spacious porch were varicolored hanging
hibiscus; and these lent much to the beauty of this spot in the
tropics.


The natives, apparently because of two generations of kindness
and teaching, seemed far more responsive than any we
had previously seen in New Guinea. They were well clothed
and clean; their children seemed happy. They did not have
the filthy black discoloration of their teeth as they didn't chew
betel leaves or betel nuts. They were reasonably industrious;
some worked on a plantation, others worked in a sawmill or
did weaving and carving.


Mr. and Mrs. Abel were quietly hospitable and entertained
us in their library. This soft, comfortable lounge contained
many fine, well-worn volumes; this room seemed almost articulate
in inviting you to pick a book and ease into pleasant
reading. These people were giving a good share of their lives

We returned at dusk, trolling through the China Straits with
our deep-sea fishing equipment. We had been impressed by
this oasis of civilization in the wilds of New Guinea. Generations
hence only the church and markers would be evidence
of the work of these few white missionaries. In the year 2144
a few blacks in the area would know how to weave and could
raise better yams. They might be clothed better and would be
freer of disease. These changes, in part, would be the fruits of
this labor.


Formal retreat, a prayer by our chaplain, ice cream and a
huge cake, with a single candle, were the order of the day on
May 25. The 37th Field Hospital was celebrating its first birthday.
It had cut its teeth near the Spoon River in Illinois and
now was an equipped, fairly experienced unit, eager to begin
functional employment. Our nurses, who were on detached
service at the 124th Station Hospital, were invited to join us
for dinner. We "broke out" clean khakis and shined our heavy
field shoes. Afterward we crashed the gate at the base officers'
club. We had our first Cokes since leaving the <i>West Point</i>.


The officers' club was only a rod from the ocean beach. The
whitecaps were silvery in the moonlight. We stood at the rail
and listened to the gentle lapping of the waves; there was a
cool, steady breeze coming off the ocean. Lights of ships at sea
dotted the horizon; they were headed into the protected shores
of Milne Bay.


The nurses had changed in these several months and seemed
more satisfied with their lot. They had found ways to make
themselves look presentable despite the drabness of their issue
clothes. They had cut their leggings short and had found some
white or light tan slacks to use for dress clothes. Brown or white
safari jackets were imported from Australia; these added much
to their appearance. The yellow, atabrine-tinged color of their

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The nurses made a better adjustment to this tropical life
than did our enlisted men. There were several reasons; they
had some diversion and professional work when on detached
service with station hospitals. Their living quarters and rations
in the hospitals were far better than those of the corpsmen.
These reasons, in part, explain why the soldiers were so discontented
during the early months in New Guinea. The best
barometer of morale among the men was their mail. The medical
officers censored it, and we found the letters a constant
source of entertainment. I made copies of many representative
letters; they vary from the following brief note to longer letters
of discontent and longing. All serve to picture the Midwestern
and Southern soldier somewhat confused and bewildered by war.

Hello Mom:


Will answer your letter received yesterday. I also had

was getting a furlough in seven more months. I sure will
be glad when he gets it. Because it realy makes a Souldier
feel good to leave camp once in a while. Mom I have sent
you eighty dollars. I sent it the first of May. You will receive
it before long. I will send you more later. Mom the
next time you see Margie S. tell her to send me one of her
nice pictures. there's a guy which is my Friend would like

you could send me an Ink-Pen Please do it. Your son.


Dear Mamey: Will write you. As I am adding more to
my writting list. I have a boy friend which is sleeping in
the same tent as I am slepping in his name is———. He
said you were his third cousin and you weren't bad looking
at all. Sure love to write all the girls. I love to write
letters and receive them also. Your cousin and I have been
together about ten months. We sure have lots of fun together.
We are in a nice coca-nut grove. Which could be
in New Guinea. This is a wonderful place down here...
and I goes swimming in the salt water about every day. it
sure is fun to swim. We have lots of bananas, Pine apples
and Coca nuts in New Guinea. Well I'll be closing for
now. Hope to hear from you soon. Just a friend.

Dear Joe:


Wrote you a long air mail letter last night. So will just
drop you a little line today. I have to go work today and
I'm going to try to catch a nap first. I slept till noon today
then played volley ball all afternoon. Some of the "Timber
twigs" went fishing today and brought home 10 nice fish
about like we use to catch. We have the coffee on now and
after while we are going to fry the fish. It will be the first
good meal I've had in a long time. That G-I food is good
stuf but the mess seargent makes slop out of it. Well Honey
must close the coffee is done and I want to help fry the
fish. We sure have a nice fire going in front of the tent.
Its sure a nice night out. Not raining for a change. Good
night. Lots of Love.


Two more letters deserve quotation. The first is only a portion
of a message home; the second is characteristic of the almost
primitive yearning which developed in some of the enlisted men:
<blockquote>

The above writer was daily brimming over with affection;
unfortunately his vocabulary was limited. His two daily letters
conformed to this type. Finally we'd take a look at the salutation,
and the letter was passed. We came to a unanimous
conclusion that there were no military secrets contained and
that his "Queenie" should not doubt his love!


We waited expectantly for further news during the month
of May. Our hospital was in a position to move with a notice
of thirty-six hours. Little news came. Colonel Sichi went to
Lae, Saidor and Nadzeb to study functioning hospitals. He
reported to us that the Markau Valley, paralleling the northern
coast of New Guinea, was bristling with air installations. The
malaria and typhus rates were higher than in our section of the
island. We were anxious to move north and do our small part
in caring for the sick.


Good news came with the bad on the last two days of May.
We learned that when alerted we were scheduled to go with
the task force which took Hollandia. Something went wrong
with our orders, however, and the 37th Field Hospital was side-tracked.
This would have been an interesting experience. The
Surgeon of the Hollandia area was surprised that our unit did
not arrive. With this information came our assignment to the
Sixth Division which was already leaving the base. We would
leave within the next fortnight. Via the "Grapevine," we were

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jungle packs, jungle suits, new shoes, camouflaged helmet
liners, jungle boots were issued to us. We each received rations
for three days, new carbines, fifty pounds of ammunition and
five new thirty-inch machetes. We would probably land in this
area "west of Hollandia" on D day plus four, following the
medical regiment with its clearing and collecting companies.


This was the tense, expectant period we had long awaited.
We heard that the troops on Biak were encountering difficulties
and were calling for reserves. Unexpected resistance by tanks
and snipers was holding them up. We packed our bedding
rolls, foot lockers, musette bags and "val paks." We were allowed
two hundred pounds of personal equipment. Then we
sat on the edge of the ocean and oiled and reoiled our carbines,
waiting for embarkation. We were ready.


Deep in the jungles of New Guinea a new rumor intrigued
us. On 2 June 1944 we heard the "scuttlebutt": "News of the
invasion in Normandy — it will be on 5 June. Landing will
be at Le Havre and Cherbourg." I have since wondered how
this news trickled down to the Southwest Pacific! If we knew
about it at Milne Bay, the Germans must have known far
more only miles away from Great Britain. On June 7th this
"scuttlebutt" was confirmed.


General Eisenhower spent most of Monday night, June 7,
visiting paratroops in England as they boarded planes for
France. Berlin radio said that Hitler would take personal command
of Nazi defense forces. Six hundred and forty naval guns
hammered the invasion coast. The greatest mine-sweeping operation
in history was made.... British radio said Allies are
landing in Normandy.... Dieppe was taking heavy smashes.
... President Roosevelt, in a broadcast to the nation, lauded
the troops which had liberated Rome, "the cradle of Christianity."
Our losses were 20,000 killed in the Anzio drive, according
to Winston Churchill.


The above events were absolutely spine-tingling to all of us

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Absolute confirmation of our Pacific "scuttlebutt" of June
2nd came from Supreme Headquarters in London on June
6th. One of the earliest broadcasts said that American, British
and Canadian troops landed on one of the heaviest fortified
sectors of France. Later broadcasts said the invasion coast extended
from Le Havre, at the mouth of the River Seine, to the
coast city of Cherbourg. Can you not envision our eager excitement
in the depths of New Guinea as we listened to the
faint broadcasts from our single, small short-wave Hallicrafters
radio?


At no time previously had the war scene looked so bright
for the Allied cause, Hitler's forces had once penetrated into
Russia in the north to Leningrad on the Baltic Sea. Their
deepest penetration south had been to Moscow and to Stalingrad
and they had almost arrived to the Caspian Sea at Vladikaukaz.
Now the Nazi attacks were being repulsed at Jassey in Rumania,
and the Hitler forces were driven back to Odessa on
the Black Sea in the south; the fighting before Kiev had ceased
and the liberated area extended north to Leningrad through
Vitebsk. The war was being won on the continent; Hitler's
"Drang Nach Osten" was being converted into a dismal, disastrous
Napoleonic fighting retreat with perhaps heavier casualties
than if we were on the offensive.
