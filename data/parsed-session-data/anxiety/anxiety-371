The next day was a very tense one for me. Attendants
hovered about me cautiously waiting for me to throw a
screaming fit. I was walking around the beds and cleaning
out the ash trays.


"Why doesn't someone clean this place up," I complained.


There was no response.


"You people don't have to stand around and watch me
all the time. I don't need it," I cried out.


"You seem to need it today," one of the attendants said.


"I'm used to playing tennis and taking walks," I screamed
at them. "I'm stir crazy today. I need some outdoor exercise,
and no one seems to be taking me out any more."


"You are in no condition to take a walk now," said the
attendant.


I looked up and saw that Dr. Schoen had come into the
ward. Now, I thought, the attendants will leave me alone.
I thought that I was going to have a conference with Dr.
Schoen.


I was very much surprised when he went to talk to the
head attendant. They whispered together and glanced in my
direction.


I screamed at them, "The only thing wrong with me
today is that these lazy attendants won't clean up the ward"


Dr. Schoen had apparently given some sort of a signal to
the attendants. Three of them approached me cautiously
and grabbed me by both arms.


"Come with us," they said in chorus. "You are in a tense
mood today."

"But I'm not, Dr. Schoen. Dr. Schoen, help me," I
pleaded. He did not answer.


I was taken to one of the back rooms where I was
stripped of my clothing. I did not know what was going on.
I screamed and screamed at the attendants. They wrapped
me in ice-cold sheets and bound me tightly. Dr. Schoen came
in to talk to me.


"This is like a mild electric shock treatment and will
calm you down."


I screamed at him, "You wait until I get out of this, you
damned son of a bitch."


He turned, undaunted by the threat, and walked out of
the room.
