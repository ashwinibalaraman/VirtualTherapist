<font size="4"><b>20: Common Medical Problems in Geriatric Patients</b></font>

It is estimated that 80% of elders have at least one chronic health condition.
Arthritis leads the list, with 48% of noninstitutionalized persons over the age
of 65 years having complaints that can be diagnosed as arthritis (Rundall,
1992). Hypertension (38%), hearing impairment (29%), heart disease (28%),
cataracts (16%), deformity or orthopedic impairment (16%), chronic sinusitis
(15%), diabetes mellitus (9%), visual impairment (8%), and tinnitus (7%)
finish the list of the 10 most common conditions. In a similar listing of the 10
leading causes of death for persons 65 years of age and over (Rundall, 1992),
heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes appear again, ranking 1, 3, and 5
respectively. Malignant neoplasms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) rank 2 and 4. This chapter contains the etiology, typical or
atypical presentations, and treatment strategies for the more common diseases
and disorders that are found in the elderly. Chapter 10 will discuss screening
for the psychological manifestations of some physical diseases.


It is helpful to group common problems into categories for discussion, but
it is important to remember that persons with multiple chronic illnesses are

<b>Diseases of Bone and Joint</b>


The most prevalent of the chronic diseases, <i>arthritis</i> is a catch-all term for
a group of diseases, including degenerative joint disease (DJD), rheumatoid
arthritis, polymalgia rheumatica, and gout. Most elders, when they say they
have arthritis, are really talking about joint pains that keep them from moving
as freely or as comfortably as they wish.


Osteoarthritis, or DJD, often presents itself as pain and limitation of motion
in a large weight-bearing joint such as the hip or knee. Patients complain of
cracking or rubbing sounds (heard as crepitus in the joint) and difficulty
climbing stairs. They find it hard to rise after sitting quietly for long periods
of time but usually do not complain of sleep loss due to pain, although they
may have morning stiffness. Characteristic Heberden's nodes, bony protuberances
at each side of the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers and toes,
are not actually all that common. DJD can also occur in joints damaged by
old injury or fracture. Treatment consists of encouraging mild but daily
exercise, avoiding overuse or underuse, and judicious use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents or mild pain medication such as acetaminophen.
(Nonsteroidals, although successful in treating acute inflammation, carry with
them their own risk of precipitating gastrointestinal bleeding and occasional
renal failure and are best reserved for intermittent use.) Although DJD has
been thought of as a nonsystemic disease (contrasting it to rheumatoid
arthritis), it can present some systemic symptoms such as fatigue. Treatment
of severely damaged individual osteoarthritic joints now includes surgical
joint replacement not only of hips and knees but even of smaller non-weight-bearing
joints. Newer types of artificial joints even come with 20-year
"guarantees" and have made a tremendous difference in patients' quality of
life.


Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs most commonly in the fifth decade of life
but can present in older persons, with weakness and aching of the arms and
shoulder or hip girdle. It, plus giant cell arteritis (temporal artery arteritis), is
considered important to diagnose (failure to treat with steroids can result

[p. <i>454</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00460&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Rheumatoid arthritis often begins in younger patients (highest incidence of
onset is in the third and fourth decades). Elderly patients are usually in later
stages of the disease with more chronic disabilities, although it does occur de
novo (Murphy, 1992). Although traditional teaching is that elderly patients
with rheumatoid arthritis do not have acute pain and flare-ups, with hot, red,
symmetrically swollen (fusiform swelling) smaller joints, there are many
older rheumatoid arthritis patients who do have recurrent acute episodes.
Chronic rheumatoid arthritis, definitely a systemic disease, is hallmarked with
joint and synovial destruction, physical deformities of bones, and often eye
(keratoconjunctivitis sicca, "dry eye"), mouth (Sjogren's syndrome), blood
(chronic normocytic anemia), renal (chronic renal insufficiency), and even
occasional pulmonary (rheumatoid lung) findings.


Patients have often been treated with high-dose corticosteroids and thus can
have some or all of the iatrogenic consequences of steroid treatment, including
Cushingoid or moon face, hypertension, osteoporosis, truncal obesity, thin
striated skin, and risk of ulcer disease.


Treatment, again, is based on identifying symptoms and treating appropriately
with exercise, medication (nonsteroidals; disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs, including gold, methotrexate, chloroquine; and pain relievers),
and if necessary, corrective surgery. Use of adaptive devices and modified
clothing fasteners allows the person with rheumatoid arthritis to continue
independent living. Courses teaching adaptive skills and self-efficacy have
shown that independent rheumatoid arthritis patients taking them have improved
health outcomes (H. Holman &amp; K. Lorig, personal communication,
1994).
<a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_8754');">[note]</a><div id="_note_8754" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">1. H. Holman and K. Long teach an effective course titled The Arthritis Self-Management
Program at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.</div>


Gout, a disorder of production or excretion of uric acid, characterized by
uric acid crystals in joints during an acute attack of joint inflammation,
chronic recurrent arthritis, and joint destruction with possible renal failure,
can manifest itself with acute pain, usually in a single joint. Subcutaneous
nodules along the extensor tendons (<i>tophi</i>) are actually deposits of uric acid
crystals. It is important to differentiate the diagnosis of gout and pseudogout
(chondrocalcinosis, with calcium instead of urate crystals) because treatment
can differ for each condition. Patients with high levels of uric acid in the blood
because of lymphoma or leukemia are usually treated prophylactically before
symptom development.


Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans) is a disease characterized by a
state of increased cellular activity in affected bones, which can enhance an
underlying disorder of the bone cells leading to a loss of control of their
growth rate (Lane, 1994). It may be an incidental diagnosis because of blood
work abnormalities, or the patient may present with severe back, hip, or head

[p. <i>455</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00461&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Chronic back pain is widely prevalent and can be frustrating to treat in the
elderly. Disc disease has recently been shown to respond no differently to
surgery than to treatment with pain medications and judicious exercise unless
the disc is completely ruptured with free fragments in the spinal canal. Other
common causes of back and leg pain include muscle spasm and strain,
vertebral facet syndromes, sacroileitis, and abnormal positioning of vertebrae
(spondylolisthesis) or narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis). The use
of MRI has made it far easier to diagnose bulging discs or varying degrees of
spinal stenosis, but unfortunately, the degree of abnormality on the MRI is
not well correlated with the degree of pain and disability the disc problem has
caused in a particular patient (Ciocon, 1994).


Osteoporosis is one of the most common causes of disability due to
fractures and injuries sustained from falls. It is estimated that postmenopausal
women lose 2% to 5% of their bone mass a year for the first 10 years after
menopause. When bone mass reaches a critically low level (osteopenia), there
is a 75% to 80% risk of fracture due to decrease in structural strength
(Karpman, 1987). It is possible that women have chronic deficits in calcium
balance (a report came out that 9-year-old 4th grade girls drink Diet Coke
instead of milk in an effort to remain slim; L. Mellon, personal communication,
June 1988) that increase risk for more rapid development of postmenopausal
osteoporosis and consequent fracture of the long bones, often hip
or wrist, or compression fracture of the thoracic or cervical spine. It is
estimated that a woman over the age of 50 has a 40% to 50% chance of
developing osteoporosis during her lifetime. Postmenopausal hormone replacement
therapy (HRT), with or without Vitamin D, fluoride, or calcium
(Rowe, 1985), is presently felt to decrease risk of osteoporosis for women.
Recently, weight training for postmenopausal women has been demonstrated
to reverse bone loss in comparison to a control group that continued to lose

[p. <i>456</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00462&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Falls, with or without resulting fractures, are a cause for great concern.
Once having fallen, the elderly patient often becomes fearful of falling, so
much so that he or she curtails usual activities. A cycle is set in place where
muscles less used become weaker and less likely to support the body of the
person to whom they belong. Thus, a weak person becomes weaker and even
more susceptible to falling. Encouraging new studies have shown that even
extremely frail elderly patients can benefit from judicious weight training,
and can improve muscle mass and strength in as little as 4 weeks (Tinetti,
1988). There are reports that weight training in the elderly can even help
reverse osteopenia. Other interested researchers are looking at ways to improve
balance and decrease the effects of loss of proprioception and vision
that contribute to falls in the elderly. Nursing homes are exploring ways to
eliminate demeaning restraints and to keep their patients safe from serious
falls by such techniques as keeping beds low with wheels locked and using
special cushions on chairs to keep patients who are truly unsafe ambulators
seated but not confined with belts or vests.


A common cause of orthopedic impairment is cerebrovascular accident
(CVA), or stroke (Rosenfield, 1991). Patients may sustain paralysis of arm
and leg as well as aphasia and may recover some motor function, more often
leg than arm, still with some residual weakness. It has been said that a patient
who has a stroke enters the hospital not walking and not talking and leaves
walking but not talking. (This, of course, is descriptive of a CVA in the
dominant brain hemisphere.) This makes sense if one thinks of a drawing of
a little man (homunculus) superimposed upside down on the left and right
cerebral hemispheres of the brain and considers that deprivation of blood flow
because of arterial blockage might have the least effect on the brain's control
center that is most distal to the blockage (the feet of the homunculus) because
there is more chance for collateral circulation to bring needed oxygen to that
area.


Even though a patient may get some or most return of leg function, the arm
may remain relatively immobile. The patient may be required to use special

<b>Vascular Diseases</b>


Vascular disease is a great cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
States. It is estimated that one quarter of the adult population has hypertension,
and half of them are unaware of it. Hypertension has been shown to increase
risk for cardiovascular disease, especially congestive heart failure, stroke, and
renal failure, and successful treatment of hypertension decreases these risks
(Fries, 1980). Although older studies of hypertensives focused on diastolic
blood pressure to predict risk (Kannel, 1987), more recently there is evidence
that isolated systolic hypertension, seen mainly in the elderly who have less
compliant arterial vasculature, is also strongly associated with risk of cardiac
failure and stroke (Higgins et al., 1993). The U.S. government recently
published its fifth list of guidelines for hypertension treatment (Joint National
Committee, 1993), and although small doses of diuretics and beta-blockers
are still listed as first-line therapies, many experts in the field of hypertension
management believe that angiotensin-converting enzymes, calcium channel
blockers, or both may still be the more effective first-line therapy, particularly
in the elderly.


Ischemic heart disease, as a result of arteriosclerotic vascular disease, is the
primary cause of death in U.S. adults. Interestingly enough, a study of the
contribution of a statistically significant combination of three of the major
risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, and smoking) for heart disease in
adult men with no significant clinical cardiovascular disease begun in the
1970s (Stamler, 1993) could never demonstrate whether intervention given to
the special care group above and beyond "usual [physician's] care" helped
decrease heart attack rates, because heart disease started showing a decline at
that time. This was probably aresult of greater public awareness of the dangers
of smoking and eating cholesterol-laden and saturated-fat-laden foods and
may parallel the decline in the percentage of smokers in the United States from
35% to 40% to the current level of 19% (Gilpin, 1994).


Treatment of ischemic heart disease has also improved with the advent of
calcium channel blockers and different preparations of coronary artery vasodilators
(nitroglycerin in pills, pastes, and patches and in mononitrate and

[p. <i>458</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00464&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Concerns of the next decade focus on prevention and early detection
because current diagnostic tests such as electrocardiograms (EKGs) and
treadmill tests have proved to have disappointing predictive value. The often
heard story of the patient who dropped dead after a normal EKG underscores
the ominous amount of false negatives that occur with these screening tools.
Women are at even greater risk, for they have been found to have less attention
paid to and thus less accurate diagnosis of the etiology of their chest pains and
less invasive treatment for their sometimes extensive coronary artery disease
(Bell et al., 1993). Recent studies of HRT have shown that its major use may
be in preventing excess coronary deaths in women, perhaps as many as 50%
(R. Marcus, personal communication, December 1994). Estrogen has been
shown to elevate levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the
so-called good cholesterol, and the inverse relationship between circulating
blood levels of HDL cholesterol and the occurrence of myocardial infarction
is being studied. Although the net effect is life saving, presumably from both
the standpoint of preventing bone dissolution and death from hip fracture and
the prevention of fatal coronary events, because HRT in older women with
uteruses has been shown to increase the rate of death from endometrial cancer,
it must never be undertaken without appropriate screening techniques in
place, such as endometrial biopsy along with pelvic examinations and Pap
smears.


Congestive heart failure (CHF) is often associated with ischemic or valvular
heart disease, reflecting the inability of a weakened heart to pump blood
efficiently to the body, which causes back pressure to fill the lungs, liver, and
dependent parts of the body with fluid. Although rheumatic mitral valve
disease is still a cause of CHF (the hallmark being cough and the frothy pink
sputum of pulmonary edema), elderly patients more commonly have aortic
valvular stenosis with severe constriction of the outflow track due to calcium
deposits. Treatment is based on decreasing back pressure, improving pump
strength and cardiac output, and (more controversially) valve replacement

[p. <i>459</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00465&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another consequence of a damaged aortic valve is idiopathic hypertrophic
subaortic stenosis in which the outflow track below the constricted valve
becomes hypertrophic, increasing the chances of a sudden fatal arrhythmia.
(This is one reason "drop attacks" need to be carefully investigated.) Other
common serious arrhythmias include stage III heart block (atrioventricular
dissociation with or without pauses), multiple-focus ventricular ectopy, and
sick sinus syndrome with supersensitive carotid sinus, where even slight
massage of the carotid sinus can cause temporary or permanent cardiac arrest.
Prolonged conduction between atrium and ventricle is also common, and
various supraventricular tachycardias and bundle branch blocks, although
frequent, are considered less ominous. Atrial fibrillation, common with mitral
valve disease and subsequent atrial dilatation, poses a special risk of clot
formation and the dislodging of parts of the clot that pass through the aorta to
the coronary arteries or to the cerebral arteries causing MI or stroke, respectively.
Diagnosis can be made with either plain EKG or with special monitors
(including the old standby Holter monitor, where continuous EKG recording
can be made for a given period of time). Electrophysiologic cardiac studies,
mappings of the entire conduction system of the heart, can be done to find the
foci of potentially fatal arrhythmias. Treatment can include implantation of a
cardiac pacemaker, surgery, or implantation of special miniature defibrillators
that shock a heart back into function every time it stops.


Peripheral (arterial) vascular disease is a common cause of morbidity.
Large-vessel disease can be treated with vasodilators or bypass surgery and
needs to be diagnosed as soon as possible. Aortic aneurysms (the abdominal
aortic aneurysm or <i>triple A</i> is more easily operated on than the thoracic aortic
aneurysm) need to be suspected and diagnosed early before separation of the
intimai layer causes development of a false lumen and major systemic blood
loss. Small-vessel disease that can occur as a result of diabetes or smoking
(Buergher's disease) is not amenable to vascular surgery and may result in
loss of a limb secondary to ischemia. Prevention presumably includes tight
control of diabetes and cessation of smoking. A recent study has shown that
asking a patient to stop smoking during an office visit results in more patients
stopping than saying nothing at all (Sawicki, 1993). The use of nicotine gum
or patches has been found to be safer than having that patient continue to
smoke, even in the person with vascular compromise, and may be able to
improve the chance of the patient quitting.


Cerebrovascular disease, secondary to hypertension and arteriosclerotic
vascular disease, is another major cause of morbidity and mortality. Ischemic
strokes--mainly thrombotic (65%) and sometimes embolic (15%), the latter

[p. <i>460</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00466&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Surgical intervention to decrease carotid artery blockage of greater than
70% (diagnosed by hearing a bruit followed by carotid echoscan or angiography)
has recently been shown to have a positive health outcome (Strandness,
1993). In one large study of physicians, the use of aspirin as a prevention for
recurrent myocardial infarction did show an increase in deaths from hemorrhagic
stroke (Alper, Gibb, &amp; Wexler, 1993), so it is possible that aspirin taken
as a prevention for stroke and myocardial infarction (and more recently for
colon cancer as well) may result in a slight increase in the number of
hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage due to falls.
It is important to remember that in all patients, especially in those taking
aspirin, nonsteroidals, or blood thinners, an episode of confusion, disorientation,
or somnolence several weeks after a seemingly minor fall could be a
subdural hemorrhage that can be diagnosed by head CT scan and treated with
surgical evacuation if necessary. Subarachnoid hemorrhages that can occur
from arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) often manifest more dramatically,
with severe headache and incapacitation, and are more difficult to treat. Newer
radiologically guided techniques such as using an intraarterial catheter to
inject a gluelike substance or coils to block arterial supply of the AVM are
showing great promise for the successful treatment of previously considered
inoperable AVMs (B. Lane, personal communication, June 1993).


<b>Neurological Disorders</b>


Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, characterized by tremor
and rigidity of gait with or without mental status changes, are also common
in the elderly. Thought to be a depletion of dopamine in the substantia nigra,
treatment involving replacement of dopamine has been used for many years.

[p. <i>461</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00467&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple or systemic sclerosis
(MS) are demyelinating diseases of the long tracts resulting in multiple
neurologic deficits. MS can present very insidiously, with ocular muscle
changes causing diplopia, weakness, and fatigue and urinary symptoms such
as frequency and incontinence. It is a disease characterized by periodic
remission and reexacerbation, and although medical treatment has been mainly
symptomatic, recent advances in possible drug treatment have been reported
(Nightingale, 1993). ALS can be generalized or bulbar. The patient with
bulbar ALS, although able to physically function, is deprived of the ability to
speak and ultimately to swallow and may become profoundly depressed. MS
patients have been reported as having a euphoria that often prevents them from
registering the tragedy of their disease, but this reported euphoria is found
more often in the breach than in the observance.


Other central nervous system diseases, such as the congenitally acquired
Huntington's disease, although usually presenting in the fifth decade, often
claims its victims before age 65 due to dementia, inanition, and infection.
Late-stage Alzheimer's disease, in which the ability to ambulate is lost long
after the abilities to remain continent and to communicate and understand is
an increasingly more common cause of neurological deficits. Dementia of the
Alzheimer's type accounts for 60% of dementias and may affect as much as
45% of the old-old (over 85 years) population. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus,
with its characteristic broad-based gait and urinary incontinence, should
always be considered in a dementia workup because of its supposedly treatable
nature.


Seizure disorder in the elderly may be a new diagnosis, reflecting brain
damage from stroke, metastases, or alcohol abuse. Diagnosis should be made
on the basis of symptoms, electroencephalogram findings, and occasionally
head CT and treatment undertaken accordingly with careful monitoring of
antiseizure medication that can cause obtundation and falls. Although state
regulations about driving vary, the elderly person with a recently diagnosed
seizure disorder should not drive.


Herpes zoster, or shingles, which involves inflammation of a particular
nerve dermatome by the varicella virus, is listed here because the neurological

<b>Diseases of the Special Senses</b>


Age-related senile macular degeneration is the most common cause of legal
blindness (visual acuity 20/200 or worse) in the United States. It has a
prevalence of 28% in the 75 years to 85 years age group (Kane, 1989).
Diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts are the other common causes
of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy can be prevented in some cases by tight
control of blood sugar and frequent fluorescein angiography with laser obliteration
of the proliferative retinopathic vessels that can destroy vision.


Cataracts, or opacification of the lens, occur as part of the aging process
and may appear as blurred or cloudy vision that makes reading difficult.
Surgery to remove the lens and implant an artificial lens gives perfect distance
vision to people who may never have had it in their lives due to myopia and
can be successfully undertaken in the very debilitated elderly patient.


Glaucoma, both closed and open angle, can be diagnosed by measuring
ocular pressure as part of periodic screening but may manifest with either loss
of central vision (central scotoma), with acute eye pain or with systemic
symptoms such as abdominal pain and vomiting. Glaucoma needs to be
included in the differential diagnosis of acute onset of abdominal pain in the
older person. Treatment can include topical beta-blockers that act by decreasing
production of aqueous humor, alpha antagonists that dilate scleral veins
and improve outflow of aqueous, surgery (trabeculectomy) to prevent buildup
of aqueous humor, or a combination of these. Untreated glaucoma causes
blindness.


Tinnitus, defined as continual sounds in the ear (buzzing, humming, or
ringing) affects almost 9% of the population over 65 years. It may be caused
by tiny abnormalities of blood flow to the ear. Presbycusis, the loss of

[p. <i>463</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000121817-I00469&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hearing impairment in the elderly is often neurosensory as opposed to
conductive loss and is less amenable to the use of hearing aids, which amplify
sounds sometimes uncomfortably (<i>recruitment</i>). Currently, there are various
types of assisted listening devices, including theater sound systems, telephone
sound augmentation, and hearing aids. Profoundly deaf individuals can avail
themselves of closed caption television programs and TTY for telephone
typewritten communication. Deaf or hearing-impaired persons need to be able
to ask for assistance, and those who communicate with them need to remember
to look at them when speaking, speak clearly, although not particularly slowly
and certainly not loudly, enunciate well, and be ready to give clarification
when points don't seem to be understood.


Chronic sinusitis is the seventh most common chronic complaint of elderly
persons and is characterized by so-called postnasal drip, cough, and headache.
Most cases are not true infection but merely thickening of maxillary or frontal
sinuses and, although not life threatening, are frustrating and annoying to the
persons affected. More serious is the loss of smell that can occur after a viral
illness, which results in loss of taste for food. Loss of the taste buds at the tip
of the tongue (salty, sweet) can result in persons adding excess salt and sugar
to their foods, harmful to people with salt-sensitive essential hypertension
(50% of elderly hypertensives) and diabetes mellitus (Nelson &amp; Franci, 1992).


Poor oral hygiene with chronic gingivitis and pockets of plaque formation
can result in loss of permanent teeth. Older patients, who may have been
subjected to old-style dentistry with removal of all their teeth, may suffer with
plates that are ill fitting due to bone resorption and shrinkage of the jaw line.
Chewing with dentures requires 60% more energy than chewing with natural
teeth (or even gums), and at least one study has shown that 22% of elderly
patients in a nursing home, when given a pureed diet because of absent teeth,
lose weight (E. Brown, personal communication, March 1993). The solution
is to pay careful attention to the dentition of older persons. Even in the nursing
home, dementia patients can be reminded to brush their teeth or gums, giving
them a feeling of self-pride that they are helping themselves and resulting in
better oral hygiene.


Examination of the teeth, gums, tongue, mouth, and lips on a regular basis,
with dental visits that include teeth cleaning and tartar and plaque removal,
helps quick identification of oral tumors with resulting improvement in
morbidity and mortality (Brangman, 1992).

<b>Pulmonary Diseases</b>


COPD, the fourth commonest cause of death in persons over 65 years, is
felt to be a disease predominantly related to smoking behavior. It is important
to realize that when the current cohort of elderly patients was in its prime,
cigarette smoking was considered glamorous, sexy, and almost indispensable.
The U.S. military in World War II passed out free cigarettes donated by
cigarette companies to young soldiers, and many of these youths carried their
smoking habit to old age (or to the grave).


Patients with COPD and obstructive bronchitis can progress to developing
emphysema, the trapping of air in small airways of the lung, with resultant poor
flow of air and poor exchange of oxygen. Patients with emphysema can be
described as <i>pink puffers</i> or Type A COPD patients. They develop dyspnea early
in their disease, coughing and wheezing are not prominent, and exhalation time
is prolonged greater than 6 seconds. Such patients have just enough pO2 to
maintain a decent oxygen saturation if not stressed with exercise or cardiac failure
(at 60% pO2, one still maintains about 95% oxygen saturation, thus one is not
"blue" or cyanotic) and a normal or moderately elevated level of CO2. In contrast,
<i>blue bloaters</i>, or Type B COPD patients, present with obstructive bronchitis:
intermittent cough and wheezing and late appearance of dyspnea despite early
development of hypoxia (low levels of oxygen pressure) and hypercapnea (high
levels of carbon dioxide; Celli, 1985). Persons with COPD in early stages require
from three to five medications to maintain daily activities, and during the late
stages, 12 medications, often including oxygen, are the average (Celli, 1985). The
disease has an incredible cost in time lost from work and early deaths. Recently,
surgical removal of the most severely dilated lobes of emphysematous lung has
been shown to help 82% of patients in whom all conservative measures have
failed (Buist, 1990; Perry, 1993).


Asthma, a reversible restrictive airway disease, is another cause of major
morbidity and mortality. Shockingly, asthma deaths have been rising in the
early 1990s, as has the number of asthmatics, with African Americans having
a disproportionate number of deaths. There is a concern that inappropriate or
even prescribed use of beta-adrenergic inhalants may be contributing to these
excessive deaths, and the use of inhaled parasympathomimetics or anti-inflammatory
or anti-mast-cell agents on a regular basis to prevent acute attacks
may become the treatments of choice. Other restrictive lung diseases that are
environmental, such as silicosis, black lung disease, and asbestosis, are more
common in the elderly than in younger patients because of the absence of
environmental safety standards during most of their working years and lack
of recognition by the medical community of dangers posed by certain elements
or chemicals during that time. (Asbestos comes most quickly to mind.)


Acute lung infections can include viral or bacterial pneumonias (Legionnaire's
disease is a relatively recent cause of morbidity) that result in chronic lung

Tuberculosis (TB) is having a resurgence not only because of a population
of immigrants from Mexico and Southeast Asian refugees who may be carriers
but also because of the emergence of resistant strains of TB (multidrug
resistant TB; mycobacterium avium intracellular) in part because of the
presence of HIV, the cause of AIDS. Persons with HIV disease often develop
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and early diagnosis is crucial because drugs
are available that can be used for prophylaxis and prevention in early disease
(Roche Laboratories, 1994).


<b>Genital and Urinary Disorders</b>


Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a cause of urinary frequency and occasional
urinary retention, although it is not associated with the development of
prostatic cancer. Drug treatment has proved beneficial in some cases, although
surgery (transurethral resection of the prostate) is sometimes needed to
improve urinary outflow.


Many times, urinary incontinence in community-dwelling elders is unreported
due to embarrassment or feelings of hopelessness. Common causes of
involuntary loss of urine include <i>stress incontinence</i>, where the urethra does
not stay shut during coughing or sneezing (or any raising of the intravesical
pressure), causing dribbling of small amounts of urine, <i>urge incontinence</i>,
where the feeling of needing to urinate is immediately followed by bladder
muscle (detrusor) contraction and urethral relaxation, causing loss of larger
amounts of urine, <i>overflow incontinence</i>, where a weak or paralyzed bladder
fills up with urine and then mildly contracts so that urine leaks out (the
"neuropathic" bladder of diabetes or MS), and the type of incontinence called
DHIC (<i>detrusor hyperreflexia and impaired contractility</i>) where the unfortunate
patient can "flood" without warning (Resnick, 1987). Two thirds of
patients with incontinence can be helped with bladder retraining techniques,
toileting schedules, drugs, or a combination of these. Even dementia patients
who no longer have control of their sphincters (functional incontinence) can
often be kept dry by establishing toileting regimes. It is no longer considered
appropriate to catheterize incontinent elderly patients because of the almost
certain development of urinary infections and ultimately, urosepsis.


Fecal and even urinary incontinence may be secondary to fecal impaction,
where a hard mass of feces in the rectal ampulla causes diarrhea around it and
flattens the urethra of the female patient causing leakage of urine. Elderly
patients need to be aware of personal toileting patterns and act quickly when
they change. Stool softeners and laxatives have the potential for abuse in the
elderly, particularly because their early training often stressed the importance

<b>Neoplastic Diseases</b>


Many neoplastic diseases with relatively high 5-year survival rates are
important to treat because this can allow elderly persons their normal life
spans: Breast, colon, and lung cancer; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; multiple
myeloma; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are often considered in this light.
Prostate cancer appears in the necropsy findings of a substantial percent of
males over the age of 80 years, whether there have been symptoms or not
(Harman &amp; Nankin, 1985). Prostate cancer has not been shown to benefit from
early diagnosis so that the use of the blood test prostate-specific antigen as a
screening tool for prostate cancer to improve health outcomes is still somewhat
controversial (Stamey, 1983). It is still important to diagnose many
neoplasms early because older people are quite amenable to the usual treatments,
although their personal preferences must be taken into consideration
when offering painful or unusually aggressive treatments. It is important that
the elderly still get appropriate cancer screening tests: mammograms and Pap
smears for women and stool hemoccults--although controversial in predictive
value, they are cheap and easy--or visual colon examinations (the "gold
standard," not practical for screening people without increased risk) or both
for both men and women. It has been shown that women over the age of 70
years, for example, have a worse prognosis than younger women when they
develop breast cancer (Korzeniowski, 1994), and indeed, all elderly patients
with cancer do worse than their younger cohorts, with a median age for cancer
diagnosis in the general population of 65.4 years, and a median age for death
of 67.9 years (National Cancer Institute, 1978).


Elderly patients, although they often believe they are not at great risk, are
not immune from HIV disease, either because they have one of the more
common risk factors, such as unprotected sexual relations with a carrier or
unprotected IV drug abuse or because of transfusions incurred during the time
when HIV was in donated blood at blood banks but no screening tools were
used that could detect it (1979-1985). Again, early diagnosis and aggressive
treatment does have a positive effect on length and quality of life.


<b>Endocrine Disorders</b>


Diabetes mellitus, affecting 10 million Americans, and thyroid disease,
affecting up to one third of older U.S. citizens, are the two most prevalent

<b>Management of Chronic Pain</b>


Older patients often complain of chronic pain, either secondary to arthritis
or after an infection with herpes zoster. Chronic pain can lead to depression
(indeed, some studies have shown that 20% or more of older people are
clinically depressed; Norris, 1987) and can result in a vicious cycle of
inactivity, muscle weakness, stiffness, more pain, and more depression. It is
important to work closely with the elderly patient and consider the use of all
modalities of pain control, including exercise, physical therapy, pain medication
(either nonnarcotic, narcotic, or nonsteroidal) and augmentation of pain
medication with small doses of antidepressants when indicated. Comments
such as "At your age, what do you expect?" when the elderly person complains
about loss of mobility or painful joints, are thankfully becoming rarer. Those
of us who care for and about older persons recognize that they can have and
deserve a good quality of life despite the presence of chronic illness.
