<b>DR. S. LIKES MANDARIN COLLARS</b> and flowy fabrics, jewel tones,
straight-legged pants. Her voice is a half-whisper, full of air. We
meet in a commercial park across the freeway from my house, the
kind with a sandstone facade and a lofty-sounding name that suggests
professional elan and harmony with nature—it's carved into a hilly,
environmentally sensitive part of town overrun with McMansions
and chichi boutiques. We are getting somewhere, even though I
tighten inside at her lexicon: <i>karma, cognitive restructuring, being your
word</i>. She makes frequent reference to <i>The Road Less Traveled</i>, and
she's asked me repeatedly if I believe in God. I'm a little scared.


I've had psychoanalysis before. My first shrink was a buxom child
psychiatrist with a too-tight Toni home perm and peasant blouses
with concho belts. I was four. I'd been sleeping poorly and frightening
myself with my own imaginings. We played cards throughout
every session; I can't fathom the clinical significance of Go Fish. I
returned to her after my sister died.


Dr. E. asked me to tell her how I felt about my sister's death,
and I didn't want to. I left the room and hid out in the bathroom
until our session was over. I wanted to be a regular fifth-grade kid. I
didn't want people to be awkward around me. I didn't want to have
to get special permission to read <i>A Taste of Blackberries</i>, our class's

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00125&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went back to analysis willingly the first time I went crazy. Jim
and I had been married for a couple of years. We were living in California
and I was clinging to my first real writing job. I was part of a
team of writers for a trade publisher; our first office was down the
hall from the industry-standard catalog for the hardware business.
As a group, we would change hands three times in three years, traded
between corporate entities like a box of staplers. A lawsuit here, a
buyout there, a layoff here, a hiring there, an IPO here, a restructuring
there, until finally everyone was bankrupt and we were all out
of work. Meanwhile, Jim had flung himself into the workforce with
the vigor of a stunned cow in a slaughterhouse and spent most days
prostrate on the couch, trying to win radio call-in contests.


Subsequently, my head became full of irrational notions. I had
fibromyalgia. I was pregnant. I was infertile. I had mercury poisoning
from my fillings. I could eat no carbohydrates, only peanut
butter and bacon. I dropped below my high school weight from
ketosis, and my kidneys almost failed. Twice, I ended up in the ER
with vague but alarming symptoms—thrombosis? Appendicitis? I
stopped sleeping at night. I'd sit, hollow eyed, on our couch, watching

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00126&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My doctor rifled through my file, prescribed Xanax, then Serzone,
then Prozac, then Doxepin. The Serzone didn't help. It gave
me tremors in my legs instead. I quit Serzone cold turkey over
Memorial Day weekend at a bed and breakfast in the Texas Hill
Country. I clung to the threadbare couch in the living room all
night, convinced that I was actually on the ceiling. I started Prozac,
and it was a miracle. Within the first week, I surprised myself by
singing while I was cooking—something I always did when I was
well. I wasn't crying anymore. I could lie down and eventually go
to sleep at night. I flourished, until I eventually broke out in hives
from the medicine.


The doctor also recommended therapy. Off I went to see P., a
licensed therapist who wore t-shirts puff-painted with humpback
whales and played ambient rain-forest white noise in her waiting
room. She had me play out my suicidal fantasies in my mind;
I'd swallow my stash of Ultram with a bottle of Wild Turkey, and
the world would close up into darkness, like an iris shot from a D.
W. Griffith movie. No longer hobbled by a crazy, hypochondriacal
spouse, Jim would become motivated and fabulously successful.
My family would be angry that I had failed in my task—to be the
good kid, the surviving kid, the kid nobody had to worry about—but
they would forgive me. P. gave me relaxation tapes and taught me

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00127&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't know if it helped, but once my corporate masters freed
me from my state of literary serfdom and I slid into an undemanding
editorial job, I felt better. I'd surf the web at lunch and walk
down to the corner for enchiladas. We paid the rent. My biggest
worry was getting pegged by a golf ball from the municipal course
across the street; errant Top Flites were always bashing windows
and denting cars.


I got so cocky that Jim and I bought a house. We got a cat. We
stopped using birth control. I became pregnant immediately, which
eventually brought me to Dr. S.


At one point, Dr. S. tells me that her babies are dead. One was
stillborn; the other lived nine days. She had a hysterectomy thereafter,
then a divorce.


Another time, she tells me that the most significant predictor of
adolescent depression isn't the parents' divorce, poverty, or even the
death of a parent. It is, she says, the death of a sibling.


One of the themes of our work together is that I am overly
judgmental and cynical. "Snippy," she says at one point. At first I am
loath to accept this assessment of my personality. Then I decide to
step back and consider it for a while.


I am an editor. Fault-finding is my stock-in-trade. Moreover, I
do have a stick up my ass. I feel personally offended by every comma
splice I encounter, every heading typeset in the wrong case. Every
mistake executed around me confirms my grammatical and general
superiority to others. Editors make unforgiving lovers.

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00128&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decide to accept Dr. S.'s conclusion. But in my odd moments I
will wonder if I'm not submitting to some kind of masochistic egoabrasion,
the kind Dr. Laura Schlessinger dispenses. God, I hope
that's not what's happening.


During one session, Dr. S. credits a Landmark Education
Forum with allowing her to get herself back together after her children
died and her marriage fell apart. She encourages me to attend
a forum. I am frightened as I drive home. But because I don't wish
to be judgmental and cynical, I make a deal with myself that I'll look
into it. I've never heard of this thing before. When I do look into it,
I am positively terrified. I do not want to cast aspersions upon any
process that allows a grieving mother to feel relief and embrace her
life after such a tragedy. But the thought of assembling in an office
park and being browbeaten does not appeal to me. Paying $400 for
the privilege appeals to me even less.


To drive home the point, my friend A. calls from Seattle. "Get
out," she says. Not <i>hello</i>. "Get out. It's a cult. Get out." It turns out
A. has been to a session of the Landmark Forum. They're good, she
says. They'll mess up your head and you won't even know it. I also
hear that they are rather litigious, so I will take pains to point out
that these remarks are strictly the opinion of my friend A.


Then I make a second deal with myself. I will remember that
psychotherapy is a tool that I am holding in my hand, like an awl
(which is funny considering that I've never held an awl in my life,
actually). I will not forget that I am the operator of this tool, not
its object. I will put down my awl if it ceases to be useful. Dr. S. is
only a person in a chair, sitting across from me and giving me her

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00129&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I will not commit to additional treatment measures unless I
deem them necessary. And I will trust myself to determine what
is right for me. If I am strong enough to be here, if I am strong
enough to talk to a stranger about hurting myself and wanting to
abandon my family, then I am strong enough to make my own decisions
about my recovery.


In so many ways, I feel that her provocative remarks are spot on.
She tells me that I am angry at Jim about something. My anger is
part of the very foundation of our relationship. I consider it and can
see her point. I realize that I very often am pissed off, unjustifiably,
at Jim. What for? For not being me? When I agree with Dr. S., she
tells me I am "coachable." Something in my gut twinges; does she
mean malleable? Suggestible? I can only determine what that word
means for me. It means that I am open to new ways of thinking,
It means that I am well enough to go to her office and listen and
decide for myself.


If I am well enough to do that, then maybe I am well. Enough.


I am confident enough in our therapeutic relationship to return
to her office one more time. We are preparing for our first trip
with the baby, a visit to California. I am nervous about the flight,
about staying in hotel rooms, about conducting the interview 1
have scheduled, about seeing all of Jim's family. I am anxious about

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It's back to the office park, back to the chair across from Dr. S.'s
couch.


I realize that I'm putting lots of effort into framing my remarks,
lest I displease her. Smiling a lot. I'd wanted an ass-kicking therapist,
but I'd also wanted the opportunity to unplug my polite conversational
mechanisms and communicate from my emotional baseline. I
want to be able to rant. As I think this, I also recognize there is value
is reining myself in; I am learning to exercise control over my own
perceptions. That's good, as long as it is I who is exercising control.
To an extent I can't be sure if that's what's really happening.


I want to describe the feelings I had when I was living in California,
the feelings that are haunting me now. The powerless feeling
of being bought and sold at work. The feeling of having to prove my
intelligence and worth in every conversation. The feeling of being
mistaken for an employee and asked to provide service whenever I
entered a retail establishment. The feeling of being stuck in traffic
and debt. The feeling of being unable to walk anywhere. The
feeling of having fighter jets from Miramar rip past my windows in
twelve-minute intervals, firing their afterburners and shaking the

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I have lots of negative associations," I finally say.


Dr. S. tells me these are feelings, not facts. I should suspend my
judgments and assessments and think of myself as an anthropologist
in a strange land. That's fair enough.


But what do you do, I ask her, when someone is trying to get
under your skin with regard to something you feel strongly about?
I am not thinking specifically of the trip now; I am extending her
nonjudgmental logic to its extreme. What if someone is insulting
you? At what point do you tell someone to shut the fuck up?


We don't. We refuse to be insulted. "I don't enroll in that," she
asserts.


I twitch whenever I hear Landmark jargon, but I breathe deeply
and let the idea sink in. I am smiling and seeing the light. I am bothered
by the abuses visited on the innocent word "enroll," but this is
useful. This is still okay. Not a problem. Not a problem at all. She
gives me several examples of her nonenrollment in action with difficult
people. Her strength and benevolence. Not a problem.


Now I feel comfortable enough to confess my unease with the
demimonde of Southern California, to describe myself by contrast
to it. Jim's parents are retired from prestigious and lucrative careers,
whereas mine are farmers of hay. They golf and drive an SUV. They
prepare sumptuous meals of osso buco from the <i>Reagan Family Cookbook</i>,
whereas we barbecue brisket.


Dr. S. appears to be smirking. Am I judging too much?


"Well, see, it's just very different from what I was raised with."

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Her smirk widens. "I see. And you say Jim is an only child?"


"Yes. As am I." I'm not quite sure I get what she's after.


"And so you stand to gain quite a bit, financially, by being married
to him." Now her arms are folded.


The room is silent for a few moments. Is she calling me a gold-digger?
And I'm not supposed to get angry?


Actually, I'm not angry, because she's just plain wrong. I could
point out that I paid off Jim's student loans when we finished grad
school and started living together, that I provided the full-time
income and health insurance during the first years of our marriage,
that for all she knows my parents could be eccentric billionaires who
just like Schlitz and farming and brisket. That she's way the fuck
out of line making rude personal pronouncements about a client's
motivations for marriage. But who cares? She's already made up her
mind.


Besides, our hour is almost over.


"It's too bad you're leaving tomorrow, because I think the Landmark
seminar would be really valuable for you," she adds, gathering
her notes.


"Yes, that's too bad."


"Maybe you'll be able to make it next time?"


"I just really don't think it's for me." I smile benignly, beginning
to rise.


She stops on a dime. "Oh, you don't? Why would you think
that?"


She's already told me that money shouldn't be a problem—not
unless I undervalue my mental health, which I clearly don't, since

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I think it's more, uh, intensive, than what I'm looking for." Is
that nonjudgmental enough?


"How can you be sure of that?" she asks. "You don't know anything
about the program."


Actually, I do. But not from the official sources.


I smile and shrug a little. "I just think an experience that intense
is not for me, not right now."


Her hands find her hips. "How <i>dare</i> you?"


"I beg your pardon?"


"How <i>dare</i> you make assumptions about something you know
nothing about? I'm really surprised at you, Marrit. You seemed so
sensible." Funny, she's not acting very nonjudgmental all of a sudden.
It seems like she gets to tell me everything she thinks or feels,
and I have to sit there and smile and take it for the gospel. How is
that therapeutic?


"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way."


She shakes her head. "I am so disappointed. I mean, how <i>dare</i>
you?"


She's still glaring at me as she runs my credit card and gives
me the slip to sign. "Anyway," she says, "shall we schedule our next
session?"


"I'll, uh, need to give you a call once I'm back in town. Otherwise,
I'll forget our appointment, I'm afraid."


Smiles are exchanged. The parking lot is sticky with the July

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

About a year later, I see The Good Therapist at a coffee shop
in my neighborhood. In a business suit, she is conversing with a guy
in jacket and tie. There's a laptop folded in front of them. I breeze
right through to the register and order my favorite coffee drink.
Baldo has just started preschool, and I am celebrating our newest
milestone. I have a contract for my book. We've even found a regimen
for controlling his eczema. I am happy. I am wearing a crappy
t-shirt and cutoffs; it's July in Texas, so who gives a shit? I sit on
the back patio and smoke a cigarette. I'm reading <i>Writer's Digest</i>.
More to the point, I feel very much like myself. I've stopped feeling
like I'm interviewing for a job all the time, as if I need everyone's
approval for how I conduct my life. How I parent my child. How
I enjoy my relationships with people. I am not overly satisfied; I'm
not smug, I'm not docile, I'm still angry about the things in life that
rile me. I'm balanced. I'm ever so Marrity at last.


I am closer than ever to reaching the coveted state of being my
dad describes as "doesn't give a shit." Within my family, this is an
exalted state. You cannot honor anyone more highly than to say she
<i>doesn't give a shit</i>. You are secure in yourself, pleased with what you
have. You don't need anyone else's affirmation.


The best part about not giving a shit is that you don't have to
wear it on your sleeve. Give a shit about not giving a shit? Never.


"Bye," I say to The Good Therapist as I leave.
