It's not like I'm some Valentino or something. I mean, Christ, if you
look close enough you can usually find itchy flakes in my hair. Also,
ever since I was a small boy, I have demonstrated episodes of involuntary
nose and eye twitching. I live practically like a recluse and
have always been pretty up front about being terrified I'd be swallowed
whole by just about every woman I've ever adored (even
when smitten immediately on a blind date, over dinnerâ€”before the
appetizer yet) to whom I ultimately say, "You're the one." I have
been known to go absolutely wild when I first meet someone who
excites me and then slowly pull back from any promises I might
have made, using anxiety or, once in a blue moon, actually feigning
an exotic disease (which then of course requires a quarantine) to
bail out of being with someone. Even though I've been told that I'm
a passionate lover, I could care less what a woman says about me
sexually, sensing that it is usually intended to mislead anyway; still I
find myself on a mission to get the kudos, and then perhaps needlessly
feel paranoid, and then ultimately move on to other pastures,
as it were. I'd much prefer to feel legitimately paranoid. All that
being said, I still consider myself one hell of an eligible bachelor.


In actuality, this deep-seated problem is not so much me as it is
the types of women who lust after me and what they expect from
the relationship. Whether they are younger or magnificently getting
on in years, the common thread is still always desperation. You
show me two desperate people trying to build a relationship and I
guarantee you that I'm one of them. I'm desperate to make anyone

Cutting down the ring of hope with the tenacity of Joe Frazier,
initially I like to corner any new object of my desire with praise,
emotional support, heat, promises, and boundless attention. I am
particularly in rare carnivorous form when my lover is bouncing
back from a drought of fondling and hasn't felt too attractive in quite
a stretch.


Then it's Mr. Hoax to the rescue! Leave it to me to turn a vulnerable,
given-up-for-lost female instantaneously into a carefree
nymphomaniac, with all her well-intended systems go for yet
another brainless attempt to get (in this case, me) to become a
mature, devoted, dynamic, unconditionally loving better half of
some exclusive pairing of the species. Have I got news for her...


<i>Red-rum. Red-rum</i>.


I'm not a womanizer. I'm not a pig. I'm not a misogynist.


So sue me, I just love being with women! I love being loved by
women. I want women to feel loved like I have yet to figure out how
to allow myself to feel loved. I guess I'm sort of a kosher guinea pig
for out-of-kilter sexual appetites.


I must enjoy making women (many of whom are either as scared
as I am of getting close to someone, or after having gone through a
real dry spell are feeling asexual) feel good about themselves again. I
do this almost altruistically, if one doesn't scrutinize, without ever
getting even a simple, "Thanks, Richard."


After the mission is accomplished, I go on automatic pilot, plan my
courteous yet expedient escape from responsibility, and count on getting
hell's wrath from this rejuvenated woman over my disappearing
act. But boy oh boy oh boy, that next guy in line is really a lucky
camper. <i>Foreplay Man</i> has done his work and not only will the next
beau reap all the benefits but will most probably feel even better, hearing
one put-down after another, on the last "misfit" she tried to love.

This dating style is not just an avocation with me but rather, upon
reflection and rigid self-examination, a dirty, rotten, selfish confluence
of unshared emotions, stemming from my seduction and neediness,
that never leaves me or my accomplice in this hologram love
better off than before my unconscious ruse started.


I am ashamed of myself.


I can't believe that I ever went beyond a flirt while knowing that,
as typical a practice as it is to kiss and hold and feel affection from
someone, a simple common part of what humans do, somehow the
humans I do it with always wind up thinking I misled or even
betrayed them. If you only hurt the one you love, then they got it
backwards. I was the wrong man. I doubt that I ever knew for sure
whether or not I truly loved them. But I can safely say that I hardly,
if ever, love myself. So ladies, I beg of you, before you splatter me all
over the sidewalk with vicious epithets, consider the source. Moi.


Could it be that I'm being far too ethical considering that most of
us know more scumbags than decent people, or is there honestly
some intrinsic problem with <i>doing it</i> with someone, when you pretty
much know down deep that the other person will never wind up
being your ongoing partner; even though you feel certain that he or
she would want that more than anything else in the world?


The biggest problem I have, right out of the gate with this, is that
I've never wound up long term with anyone yet, for better or for
worse, so consequently I have fucked over everyone who has ever
fallen in love with me. Ouch! I feel like calling 911 on myself.


"I'd like to report a sick fuck."


"What seems to be the problem?"


"I'm about to see another chick who digs me and I think I want to
make it with her."


"Sir, you're gonna have to speak slower."


"Sorrrrrrrrrry. I'mmmmm about to seeeeeeeee another chick
who digggggggggs me and I think I want to maaaaaaaake it with
herrrrrrrrrrr..."


"Sir, you're tying up our line for real emergencies." Click.

"This <i>is</i> a real emergency, you jerk-off," I bellow into the void of a
defenseless receiver.
