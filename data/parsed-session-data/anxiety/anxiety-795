BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: [Scratching sound] I don't know, maybe since we started.
THERAPIST 1: But it might — it might be on par with when you actually had your baby by then.
THERAPIST 2: Oh, [chuckles]...
CLIENT: Yeah, I forgot about that part, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles] You were busy, you know, giving birth...
CLIENT: Some parts are kind of blurry, uh, [chuckles] but it has been nice. We were actually, um — we were up in Canada for the two and a half...
THERAPIST 2: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: ...Weeks we did, about, uh, a week and a half with Todd's family, at their cottage in Canada...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And they're in central Canada. And then we were down 'cause my family has a place in southern Canada, on the beach. Um, so we just felt so spoiled.
THERAPIST 2: Nice family (ph).
CLIENT: Like, we had this week and a half on the lake, and then we got to go to the ocean; like it just — it worked out really nicely. And it was so nice that Todd could take that time off and...
THERAPIST 1: [Clucks] Yeah.
CLIENT: I felt like I was kind of looking forward to that.
THERAPIST 1: Hmm.
CLIENT: Like, when he went back to work, and kind of knowing, "OK, I really just have to get through you know, April and May, and then this month of June, he doesn't — it is not too intensive work for him.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: So it was kind of really nice to anticipate that time away. And we weren't sure when we would be coming back, but we kind of — before we left, we were thinking we would get lots of work done while we were up there because we could kind of hand Trae off to Todd's parents... [00:01:09]
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm
CLIENT: ...And my parents weren't with us but were coming up a bunch 'cause they were only a 45-minute drive away. But we really didn't get that much work done. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So he was like, "We better get home in the next week," so we've been home this whole week.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: Um, and he's been at work this week, which has been a little hard, I think, for both of us, kind of trying to flow (ph) back...
THERAPIST 1: Trying to transition back, yeah. The...
CLIENT: ...Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 1: Um, how — what was difficult about getting work done? Were you not able to hand off Trae when you wanted to and then...?
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think it was just [slaps surface] we were more in funny mode — you know? — so we weren't really getting stuff done.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: And — and Todd's parents are really good about taking him up between feeding him, you know, and it just like...
THERAPIST 1: That's not really that much time.
CLIENT: ...There really isn't that much time. And I feel like his mom, especially, is so good about offering, but I feel a little bit like — with my own mom, I think I'm better about "Here, take him. I've got to go do work."
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm. [00:01:56]
CLIENT: And I'm very close with Todd's mom but not — I wasn't quite to that point of, "OK, I'm going crazy 'cause I've got to get something done. Take him!" [Says breathlessly] Like — so it wasn't [taps surface] quite so easy to just hand him off. Plus, it was just fun to have Todd home; like, it was nice to be doing things during the day, all together.
THERAPIST 1: Uh-huh, as a group.
CLIENT: So I think it was OK. And we'll be going out, um — we're trying to figure out when we'll go, but now my grandmother— the one who likes to gamble [chuckles] — is coming on Monday, to our house, and she's actually going to be up for three weeks. And she hasn't met Trae yet, so....
THERAPIST 1: [Clucks] Oh...
CLIENT: ...So we'll want to get up there. And I feel like that will be easy because my mom's sister is there, and a bunch of people will be up at that time.
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I think I learned — 'cause now I do kind of have finals hanging over me.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: I just don't get them done. Like, I don't like that feeling of...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Having them, you know...
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...Why I'm having to do it. So I think being at the cottage kind of showed me I need to be a more — a little bit more proactive about, "OK, I'm going to feed him tomorrow morning, and then I'll give him to you for two hours, and then I'll come back," or whatever.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: You know. And I think that will be easier. Um... [00:03:01]
THERAPIST 1: Will he take a bottle? Can you pump?
CLIENT: [Taps surface] He does, yeah, so that is awesome, too.
THERAPIST 1: And that stretches your window a little bit.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. So I think — I think it was me just kind of happy be — to be...
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...At the cottage and be away, so it was kind of like...
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST 1: Well, if you're enjoying vacation with your family...
THERAPIST 2: ..."Eh, I don't really need to do it." Yeah. [chuckles] But I think, when we go up, we'll be able to balance it a little bit better. And I think Todd will be able to come with us for parts of it and then maybe stay down here, too. Um, so I'll figure it out, but I'll — but it was definitely just nice to...
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Be away and even plan little day trips — just the three of us, too — which was just fun to...
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: I'm glad you enjoyed your time.
CLIENT: Yeah. And that he's — today, he's three months old.
THERAPIST 2: Three months old? Wow.
CLIENT: So I can't believe it. And I just feel like it has been going so well. Like, we definitely have had our little, you know, ups and downs, but, for the most part, I just feel like it has been so fun. You know, and now...
THERAPIST 2: Oh, that's wonderful.
CLIENT: ...Like, he's starting to sleep so much longer, which has opened this whole new world to us. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: And [says excitedly] we don't feel so tired, and — yeah, so that has really been helpful. And we moved him out of our room, into his own crib and... [00:04:04]
THERAPIST 1: Oh, wow, that's a lot of transitions opened (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. And we're putting him down (ph) now — 'cause we were kind of staying up for his last feeding, like feed him every three hours...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And the last one, we would stay up and usually do it around ten or 11. And this was, like a couple of weeks ago, and now, like this past week and this week, we've been trying to give him a real bedtime...
THERAPIST 1: Mm, for bedtime ph.
CLIENT: ...Like, earlier. Um, so that's been — I think we're still kind of playing around...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...With when we do that and when we eat dinner and stuff like that.
THERAPIST 2: Right, yeah.
CLIENT: But I think, once we get him in a real bedtime...
[Crosstalk]
THERAPIST 2: Once you get a little bit of an evening together when he's sleeping.
CLIENT: Exactly. And that happened last night, and we were "We're eating dinner without a baby in our arms, or switching on and off!" Or — it was so different to just...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Be the two of us watching TV and eating dinner. It was just [chuckles] — we hadn't done that in a while.
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: So I think that will be really nice.
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: Like, we're still trying to...
THERAPIST 2: It is developing a little bit of a routine and...
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: That takes a long time.
CLIENT: Right, which it — it is just — it is very different. [00:05:02]
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like that was kind of our thing. Like, we loved to — we...
THERAPIST 1: Yeah.
CLIENT: I'd be at school by around...
THERAPIST 2: You're talking about having — making nice dinners?
CLIENT: Yeah, and so it was nice. Like, we definitely have been good about — well, Todd has been good about still cooking a lot, even with Trae.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, now, that we could actually, like...
THERAPIST 1: Interact (ph)?
CLIENT: ...Cook and both enjoy it. It was nice. So — so I feel like that's been really good. And I think the only thing right now that I — like, that is on my mind is just worrying that it won't stay like this that I will — I'll have trouble sleeping again or I'll think of things to worry. Like, it is all — and I know I've probably been saying this ever — ever since he was born...
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Like that worry of, "Oh, things are really good right now."
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, things have gone really well.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: And they may continue to go really well.
CLIENT: Right, right, which is also a good reminder. And I did have — there were — in this stretch since I've seen you, there were two nights — not consecutive, but two nights that I did have trouble sleeping. [00:06:01]
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: And the first night, I think, was just 'cause we had friends staying with us, and the house was cramped, and...
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: ...I didn't know when they were leaving, and I, like, it just felt unsettled and...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...So it wasn't like I was up with a worry, like has happened in the past...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...But I just was kind of up.
THERAPIST 2: You don't [keep him up] (ph).
CLIENT: And — but there was like a part of me that, with my old kind of strategies where I'd get up and read or whatever — when I was lying in bed, awake, I almost didn't want to do that 'cause it was almost like admitting...
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, it was.
CLIENT: ..."I'm going to have to go back to what I did before." And so I didn't let myself get up. I was almost like being stubborn about it, like, "I don't have to get up and read. I can get myself back to sleep...
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: "...I don't want to have to get into that again." And so, eventually, I did get back to sleep, but it did take me a long time.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: And then, the next night, I was kind of worried that that would happen again, and it didn't, which was great.
THERAPIST 2: Right.
THERAPIST 1: Right.
THERAPIST 2: And that — that's a really important lesson to...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...To try to keep in your mind, is that, because you have this worry of what if things don't continue to go well... [00:07:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: And the lesson of — there will be — there will be nights or there will be events, or something that won't go right...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...But that doesn't have to mean that it is going to continue to not go right.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: You could have a night where you don't get to sleep, or you could have a day where everything just feels really frustrating, and you feel really easily frazzled.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: But that doesn't mean it is ongoing.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. And I think I was good about telling myself it was just one night, and not to let myself get too worried about it. And I think it happened at night right before we were going up to Canada, anyway, so it was kind of nice to then just — being in a new place for sleeping anyway, so it was like starting fresh. Like, "Don't worry about that night before.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And then it happened again — I don't know — more than a week and a half later, probably, but when we were up in Portland.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: And the same thing — I did not want to [taps surface] get up. And it is so funny — we have this teeny, tiny little cottage, so...
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...It would have been so easy to just get up and take two steps to the couch, and read for a little bit, but I — again, I didn't want to do that 'cause it felt like I was falling. I didn't want to start that pattern of having to do that... [00:08:11]
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Because it definitely worked to get me back to sleep, but thinking about it — like, now it is just so nice not to have those worries, and I felt like, looking back on it, it is exhausting...
THERAPIST 1: Right.
CLIENT: ...Have those worries and have to get myself up.
THERAPIST 2: To have a [set routine] (ph).
CLIENT: Read, like have my routine, and then I can go back and — so I almost didn't do it. And then Todd, when he woke up, he — in the morning, he was, like, "Yeah, you didn't sleep very well. I could tell you were tossing and turning." He was like, "Why didn't you just get up and read?"
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I was, like, "I didn't want to!" [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So I don't know...
THERAPIST 2: ...Of which is more disruptive.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Like, well, is it more disruptive to fight that?
CLIENT: Right, right, because I was thinking I could have got myself back to sleep in half an hour if I have done it, but...
THERAPIST 2: Instead, you had a very luscious (ph) night.
CLIENT: Yeah. So it is almost — 'cause I feel like I was able to develop some strategies that helped in terms of — of a routine to getting myself to sleep. [00:09:01]
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I almost — like, we talked about...
THERAPIST 1: You've got to [lock it] (ph).
CLIENT: ...Like, with the longboard (ph). Right, 'cause it got [strikes surface] tiring to have to do it all.
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I've noticed that now, too, because — with Trae — when we were giving him that liter bottle and not going to bed until the liter — Todd was giving the bottle, and I would pump, or I would — you know...
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Then, it was like get him down, and we'd be exhausted and go straight to bed.
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I never even...
THERAPIST 1: Right, it was so...
CLIENT: ...Hadn't done my reading or anything. Like, [slaps surface] I would read on the couch before he was born and then go to bed.
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And even just last night was like the first night where we had gotten him down, and we had this nice time to ourselves. And for the first time since he's even been born, it popped into my head, "I wonder if I should go to the couch and read."
THERAPIST 1: Right.
CLIENT: And I wasn't feeling like anxious or anything, and I...
THERAPIST 1: Right.
CLIENT: ...Was a little tired, so I was like, "I think I'll be fine." And, again, it was in my head, "Don't do that because you don't want to have to get into that." [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST 1: Right.
THERAPIST 2: So I think you want to have a routine...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...But it doesn't have to be that. [Strikes surface]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: It can be something that feels less intrusive because you're not having trouble sleeping... [00:10:01]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...And you're not having as many intrusive and obsessive worries as you were before.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: The reading was really important at that phase of your life...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...Because [strikes surface] without it, your mind turned to other things that got in the way of being able to relax and fall asleep.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: But they're not there, and we don't need to go looking for them.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: And this is another phase of life, and it might be that, you know, you're involved in your routine, and reading doesn't necessarily need to be a part of it...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...Not because it is such a fearful thing — you know, such a — you know, such a horrible routine, but you just don't need it.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: Your routine can be as simple as [slaps hands] washing your face and brushing your teeth, and going to bed.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: That could — that could be what works now.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: And that wasn't working, you know, six months ago or...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...But it — it might work perfectly well now...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...And that can be enough.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, I think that makes sense. It just — it is funny looking back on that time now...
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: ...And knowing I'm feeling good, like, "Oh, I figured out something that helped and that worked." But it was — like, it just felt like, now that I have the hindsight, it felt so tiring, like there were all these, like... [00:11:08]
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm, right, there were a lot of moving pieces to it...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...And it was very — it was very intentioned, and it needed to be very intentioned.
CLIENT: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: But it doesn't sound like you need that right now.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it was funny 'cause we have, um, [clucks] — they're doing construction on our steps, inside, up to our apartment...
THERAPIST 2: Ah.
CLIENT: ...And so we've been having to use this back entrance that we don't really use. And the other night, I was going to sleep, and I was like, "Oh, I wonder if I locked that back door."
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: 'Cause that's something that, a lot of times, when people come in and out of there, like at a random time, [slaps surface] they don't lock it. And I was, like, "Oh, I don't know. I'm so — so tired. [Chuckles] I'm just going to go to sleep, and I'll check it in the morning."
THERAPIST 1: Ch-
CLIENT: And I was like, [Slaps surface] "That's good!" Like, it didn't make me stay awake...
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...And I didn't get up and go down and check it, so that felt good.
THERAPIST 2: Hours of sleep deprivation, huh?
CLIENT: I know.
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: I was like, "This is really good. [Chuckles] Trae's really helped me."
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: So I think that — it is nice. Like, it is funny to have this feeling now of looking back at those worries and just like... [00:12:05]
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: ...It is. It is this sense of, "Wow, I tired myself out with that."
THERAPIST 2: Wow. Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I think, now, to have that time to look back at that time now is why I'm realizing, "Yikes, I was tiring myself about not worrying and having those routines."
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: ...But I think that's part of why, now, I'm like, it is so nice not to have that, and I just don't want to have to fall back into it.
THERAPIST 2: Right. And there's nothing — there's nothing to say you will.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 1: It is great. Even if you don't worry about worrying about it....
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 1: ...You can — that's not preventing it from happening.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 1: Um, you have a lot of power over what you let your mind dwell on...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 1: ...And that's what — that's what's really going to protect you.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 1: Noticing what's going on in your head and choosing whether or not to give it attention.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm. And I think even those couple of nights when I was awake, there was one night, and I was thinking — I just was thinking about when — before, when I was having trouble sleeping, and we had passed in, um, one article for a cast (ph) we're submitting for a publication, and I was one of the authors. [00:13:13]
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: So I'm not a lead author, so I didn't write — work on it much (ph), and I kind of felt guilty about that. I was like, "Maybe I shouldn't be [chuckles] listed as an author on this." But I just ran it over quickly to give my sign-off on it...
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And, in the middle of the night, when I was sleeping, I — there was almost thinking like, "Oh, that?" Like, quick review and signing off on it didn't worry me.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: And it would have worried me before. And because I was so tired, and it was the middle of the night, I could feel myself saying — thinking, "Should I be worried about that?"
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, almost looking for that...
THERAPIST 1: To have something...
CLIENT: ...worry. And I think it was — it is almost like when I'm not over-tired in the middle of the night, like that was like that moment of weakness...
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: ...Where I was like, "Oh, I could worry about that." And...
THERAPIST 2: So how do you answer yourself — "Should I worried about that?" What do you answer? [00:13:59]
CLIENT: I think, because, that night when I did sign off and submit it, I felt fine about it, and I — you know, I wasn't — I didn't worry about it that night when I did it, and so it was like the thought came into my mind maybe a week later...
THERAPIST 2: I see.
CLIENT: ...And so I just told myself, "If you were able to submit it, and [slaps surface] that — it didn't worry you then, like, it should not be a worry right now."
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And I just...
THERAPIST 2: That sounds good.
CLIENT: So — and I guess that worked. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm, yeah. It — I mean, you acknowledged that you were thinking about it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: And you came up with a reasonable answer. You know, "I read it. I was fine with it at the time. I'm going to continue [slaps surface] to be fine with it."
CLIENT: Yeah. But it was interesting, though.
THERAPIST 2: You were trusting yourself.
CLIENT: Right, yeah. But I felt like it — it only popped up only because I was in that moment of, like...
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, your defenses were really down.
CLIENT: Yeah, definitely. So — and I was able to get through it, but...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm, and you were [able to ] (ph) [inaudible at 14:50]?
CLIENT: Yeah. But I do — I think it is just that, like — the only worry I have now is like the worry of falling back [chuckles] into worrying so much. [Chuckles] [00:15:00]
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, it was a scary place to be when you felt so anxious.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: And that's often the case. Um, with a lot of the different types of anxiety disorders, you know, for people who have panic attacks...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...It doesn't really fit for, um, the way that you described your anxiety, but, um — you know, one of the scariest things for people who have had panic attacks is the fear that they're going to have another one...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...You know, an actual event...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...Is really traumatic, and then this constant fear that it is going to happen again.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: And you're having that same kind of fear of the — the trauma of having been so anxious for such a long time...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...That you really don't — of course, you really don't want to go back to that.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: And I think the longer that you are away from that period of your life...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm?
THERAPIST 2: ...The more secure you'll feel with what, right now, feels like it is relatively new-found health.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Um, it feels, you know, pretty — pretty fresh.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: Um, and, you know, the longer you stay in good health, the more you will trust that it will stay. [00:16:02]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: And the more power you give to yourself to be able to sustain it, that it is...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...You know, it is not by luck that you're feeling better.
CLIENT: Yeah, mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: You worked hard to develop some skills and to develop some ways of thinking that keep those worries at bay.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: You redirect your thoughts when they pop up, and you have new ways of soothing yourself, you know, not just to sleep...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...That was a big focus — soothing yourself to sleep...
THERAPIST 1: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...But soothing yourself so that you could be relaxed.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: I mean, those are all things that you have power over.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: You'll start trusting them more and more that they're going to continue to help you and stick around, and keep those really anxious times away.
CLIENT: Yeah. And it was funny — we did — um, one night when we were at the cottage, Todd's parents watched Trae for us, and we went out to dinner, and that was the first time we've been out, just the two of us.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I had my mom maybe watching when I went back to class for one or two times...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...But it wasn't like a...
THERAPIST 1: Like a first date...
CLIENT: ...A fun thing that we were leaving him for something fun. And it was funny — like, we both had a little trouble leaving him. [00:17:02]
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: And, in the car, I had, like, it was that kind of like — it reminded me of, like, that anxious feeling.
THERAPIST 1: Mm.
CLIENT: And I was thinking to myself, "Oh, that's so funny. This is the first time I've felt that in a really long time," that just unsettled kind of feeling.
THERAPIST 1: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And then — and I — and we were talking about it, and I was like, "Well, I know this is normal 'cause I have friends who have told me they were bawling when they left their baby for the first time."
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: And I wasn't doing that, so I knew it was fine. But that was...
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: It was funny to kind of feel — it was, like, "Oh, this is a weird feeling, like, that I remember, but I hadn't felt it in so long.
THERAPIST 2: Right, yeah, and it is such a different context. You had never felt it...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...With regard to loss or leaving.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah, so that felt really different. And then we had a really nice night, so it went away. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: But it was interesting to kind of feel that again.
THERAPIST 2: And just that you two do that, that you can have that feeling and be really unsettled...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...And sit with it for a little bit, and then allow yourself to move on.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: That you could go on to have a really nice night with your husband... [00:18:00]
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...And come back, and Trae was fine, and you're fine.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: And I think that's really important. Like, those moments of how you're able to set aside the feeling and — and have a different feeling...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...The space for something different. The little things to kind of lean on...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...To — you know, next time that thought pops up, of, "Oh, I wonder if — and I hope that," you know...
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: ...Well, if it does, then you'll — you'll manage it...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...Just like you did that feeling — you know, that unsettled feeling that came up when you left.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm.
THERAPIST 2: And you acknowledged it, you moved on from it, and you felt something different.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, so I guess just reminding myself — myself of those times will — will help.
THERAPIST 2: 'Cause it — you know, it doesn't have to be these feelings that are so scary.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: 'Cause the scary — what's really scary is not the feeling but that it — you're afraid it is going to stick around forever.
CLIENT: Right, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Um, and it doesn't have to 'cause you have all these ways of coping now that you — that you didn't have.
CLIENT: Yeah, [pauses] which feels good. [Chuckles] [00:19:02]
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, it gives you so much more power, and you feel...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...So much more secure.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. I think the only thing that's left is the whole driving thing — is...
THERAPIST 2: Mm, is that coming up more?
CLIENT: Well, it is not; I think that's what's helped — why I'm not getting over it, but I just — our lifestyle — like, I just don't...
THERAPIST 2: You don't need...?
CLIENT: ...Drive, [slaps surface] and I love walking everywhere alone, just throwing him in the stroller, and we'll go. So it is kind of rare the opportunities come up that I need to drive, anyway.
THERAPIST 2: Right, so you just kind of [channel it yourself] (ph).
CLIENT: So I think we do need to be better, 'cause even when we were up in Portland, my parents were laughing. They're like, "I can't —" — 'cause I still hadn't driven with him yet at that point.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: 'Cause there were a couple times where I thought — I think even we were talking like I was going up to visit a school...
THERAPIST 2: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...And I thought I was going to have to bring Trae, but the way the day worked out, like, Todd was — we all went to Cambridge together, and then I took the car from Cambridge, but Trae stayed with Todd. So it was just like little things that...
THERAPIST 2: So you were [fine when you were talking about yourself] (ph)?
CLIENT: Yeah, and I was fine with myself, but little things like that kind of just worked out that I didn't need to drive him, and so then I drove — we were going up to dinner, which was like a mile away, and so I was the driver with everyone in the car. [00:20:07]
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: But I still hadn't driven just the two of us.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: And then, on Wednesday, I'd been wanting to go to this new moms' group in Cambridge, and it just worked out that I hadn't been there yet 'cause it always fell on a time before when school was happening...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...That I was going into school for meetings, and then we went away, and it was something I really wanted to try. And then Wednesday was so hot, and I was like, "Ah! I feel really guilty, like I don't want to have to put him in the stroller and walk."
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: But another part of me really wanted to go. And so Todd's like, "I'll leave you the car, and you can decide what you want to do." And so we did — I did drive them there, and that felt — it felt really good to do it, like I was very — I was proud of myself that I did it.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: 'Cause I kept telling myself — I wasn't not driving him and missing opportunities; I was just not driving 'cause I didn't have the opportunity.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: And I was like, "Here's an opportunity. I want to do this. I'm not going to let driving be the thing that makes me not go." [00:21:05]
THERAPIST 2: Takes away that...
CLIENT: So I did go, but — and it was fine, as soon as we did it.
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, easily just [slaps surface]...
CLIENT: But, yeah, we just [got in] (ph). But I do — like, that is still that way.
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: Like, I feel like, if I have the option to drive or walk, like, I'll always walk just so I don't — I mean, for some reason, it is nice just 'cause I like to exercise, and it is nice to get outside.
THERAPIST 2: Right.
CLIENT: But I feel like I — I always will choose the walking even if driving is more convenient, just 'cause I still am not comfortable with that yet.
THERAPIST 1: Right.
THERAPIST 2: But when it really — when you really didn't — when you really didn't feel like driving, was it an option? You drove, and you were fine.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Like, you're hesitant to make a huge deal out of it because it sounds like...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...If you were living a different lifestyle, and you weren't driving, and you were missing lots of things...
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: ...I'd say, "Well, clearly, it is getting annoying."<br />
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: And we don't want — we don't want you to feel limited.
CLIENT: Right.
THERAPIST 2: Um, and since — you know, it is this thing that you're a little anxious about, but it is not really limiting you. [00:22:01]
CLIENT: No. Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Um, and there time — come a time when, you know, you live in a place, and you have to face it a lot more, and see what happens then.
CLIENT: Mm-hmm, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Um, but, you know, there would be a lot of people that would think that you're making really healthy, good choices for the...
CLIENT: Right. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST 2: ...Environment and your — and your body... [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...All sorts of things.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Um, so, I mean, you have to be the gauge of it. How anxious is it making you? How much is it getting in the way? Is it getting in the way? And, if it is — you know, if it is causing you a lot of anxiety, or if it is getting in the way, then we'll work on it.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: But I don't want to go looking for things.
CLIENT: No, and I agree. And I don't feel like it is. But I do feel like that's — I do feel like it is another example of not fully trusting myself, which is what we've talked about.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: But it is something that is not really getting in my way. And I feel really strongly that I don't want to let it get in my way, so that's why I did drive to that new moms' group.
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: So I won't — I don't want to make it an issue, but it is just kind of in the back of my mind.
THERAPIST 2: So just sort of be cognizant of it, yeah, that...
CLIENT: Yeah. [00:22:59]
THERAPIST 2: ...You know, when those opportunities come up, that you're making the best decision based — including all the factors...
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST 2: ...Um, and how much is the anxiety kind of ruling your decision-making.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: Anything else we should be catching up on?
CLIENT: I think that's everything. [Chuckles] Um...
THERAPIST 2: It sounds like you're doing great.
CLIENT: Yeah, I know. It is...
THERAPIST 2: It is really nice to see you enjoy this good health and...
CLIENT: Yeah, and it is just so nice. Like, I feel like I really want to enjoy this time before I go back to school, too.
THERAPIST 2: Yeah, it is a bright (ph) time.
CLIENT: Like, I just feel so lucky that I have this time. And I think — I have some friends who've had babies around this time and have — are already back at work or are just trying to figure out what they're going to do, and I just feel so lucky. And it is nice 'cause I feel like, on some days when it has been a really long day, and he's been cranky...
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Or like it just hasn't been the most fun day, like, to still remind myself that we're just so lucky that we have this time, 'til the end of August, really, so...
THERAPIST 2: Mm.
CLIENT: ...That's nice.
THERAPIST 2: Well, that's wonderful that you can — that you can appreciate it that you do.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. I really want to keep reminding myself <i>to</i> appreciate it 'cause I feel like, as soon as I'm back at school, I'll just miss this being able to wake up and think, "Oh, what are we going to do today? We'll go for a walk, or we'll go to moms' group, or whatever." [00:24:09]
THERAPIST 2: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Like, it is just so nice to have the time with him.
THERAPIST 2: Well, I'm glad that you're getting a chance to do that.
CLIENT: So yeah, yeah.
THERAPIST 2: All right, let's schedule for another check-in (ph)?
CLIENT: OK, good.
