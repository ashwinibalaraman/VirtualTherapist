The ensuing thirteen months were largely spent in tedious
preparation for field duty; interspersed was duty in Chicago of
the same type previously described. There were events which
stand out as islands in a memory stream which is slightly muddy.
I wish to tell of these events and give a picture of this fragmentary
type of memory which is so typical of an organic amnesia. The
recount of this hazy picture is a pleasure, because the events
were in a sense pleasurable or unusual. Because of this they can
be recalled; all this is due to the original sticky, indelible impression.
Severe sickness and extreme, desperate measures in therapy
could not later erase them.


On New Year's Day of 1943 I left Chicago to take the six
weeks' course at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. There was a
definite mood of anticipation in my demeanor. For months I
had talked about learning duty in the field. It was my opinion
that a medical officer was of more value on field duty than in
an administrative position in the services of supply. This assignment
to Carlisle Barracks meant that soon I would be transferred
to a field unit. Then I would not have to cuss under my breath
or through a sandwich with only Charles as an audience. I
reiterate that the prospect appealed to me. This seemed to be
the only high adventure open to men in the Medical Corps.


The Medical Field Service School at Carlisle Barracks was
buried in the snow of a Pennsylvania winter when I reported.
It looked moderately rough. Contrasted with the steam-heated
comfort of the Civic Opera Building in Chicago it was plain

Huddled in those Pennsylvania hills were almost a thousand
medical officers from camps throughout the country. They were
being "indoctrinated" into field duty. Description of them is
difficult—they were a motley group of soft doctors being treated
like the infantry men. Regular army medical officers were running
the show; they must have derived some manner of sadistic
pleasure from the program. The men on the faculty had learned
to march in a harder way years previously; they now sought to
teach us in a matter of hours. They did not succeed; six weeks
later when we "marched to graduation" it looked like a Pennsylvania
version of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. Perhaps
the disorder was due to fatigue and disgust!


Breakfast was at 6:30 in the morning or earlier, with a half-moon
laughing at us through the morning gloom. At about 7:25
"the band" blared east of the barracks and we assembled for
roll call, usually with a half-eaten hard sweet roll in our mouths.
Brief, toothy instructions were given for the day, then someone
would yell, "Attention!" in the half-darkness. We became more
stiff with this command. Out of the night, from a scarred-up
larynx, came, "Right face!" With this command we'd occasionally
look each other in the eye after executing it and would
choke on the remainder of the sweet roll. Then, with a hybrid
army band leading the way through the snow drifts, we'd
stumble off to classes. Little wonder I was later to censor our
own corps men's mail and read statements like the following in
a letter to a "buddy":


"This medical outfit is sure a bunch of misfits from top to
bottom. Doctors are no good for officers. I would give anything
to be in a combat outfit like yours. These ‘croakers’ are good
docs, but they sure aren't good medical men. They don't know
any more how to handle men than you do garden tools. It takes
the curd out of your urine."

Mid-February found me back in Chicago sharing with
Charley Bell some of the experiences "in the field." We laughed
and joked over a bottle of Scotch in the Bells' Evanston attic
apartment. Meanwhile our wives glared at us for spending
money on Scotch. With some persuasion we changed their mood
with a few puny drinks. They finally agreed that the Civic Opera
House and Evanston living were not designed for a pair of
willing soldiers. The following morning Dr. Bell and I trudged
"to work" from the Northwestern Station to the Civic Opera
House with our lunch boxes hid in zipper cases as usual. We
were heading for the old routine but events were moving downwind;
we smelled new experiences.


Mrs. Leach always stated that this Chicago period, affording
us an opportunity to live in quiet Evanston, was the happiest
of the war period for her. I have no doubt that she was correct.
She had several close friends who enlivened her life; these girls
lived a fuller, if more troubled life, than did her friends in
Mendota. Richard had an opportunity to go to a nursery school,
and Marion welcomed this pre-school educational teething for
her small son. Then there were occasional evenings at the Beach
Walk of the Edgewater Beach Hotel, good dinners with friends
in Chicago, and she could do more serious musing in the delightful
cool evenings at Ravinia, adjoining Highland Park, Illinois.
Here soft music seemed to gently tender the prophecy that all
would finally be well, despite the war storm in which her life
was engulfed. She was entitled to the gaiety of thought evinced
by the strings; far in the background was a discordant roll of
drums to which she would have to listen for months. Later, with
daily troubles and foul worry a monthly fare, thoughts of this
period helped assuage her concern.


Officers were leaving the General Dispensary weekly for new
assignments; they were being replaced by older men and by
doctors with disabilities which had classified them into "Limited
Service." Major Olwin left the dispensary; Lt. Col. Hick appointed
me as chief of the surgical service during April. It was
only another title designed to fill the table of organization of
an army general dispensary. But in work outside the dispensary

Events moved along swiftly; none were too disconcerting, as
we accepted disappointments and this routine work with a
clammy indifference. Twelve months in the army had dulled
our professional propriety; our attitudes were as calloused as
the middle fingers of our writing hands. When you sit hour after
hour writing reports of physical examinations your conscience
seems to slowly sink down the brain stem until it finally rests
near your bottom. After days of this mood you might possibly
be pleasantly surprised by orders to accompany a convoy across
the country as medical officer. Here was travel, relief from
ennui, and an opportunity to make some extra money. On one
such trip to Texas, early in 1943, I was able to get several days
leave pinned in the middle of the time needed to go to the Southwest
and return. Marion met me in New Orleans; we renewed
our acquaintance with the French Quarter, ate some fancy
meals and had coffee and crullers at The Morning Call. We
had little reason to complain.

Point, Mississippi, with whom I am now associated in the practice of
medicine.</div>


Burgundy wine, a bit of ribaldry by Charles and John during
our beach picnic of celebration, drinks of straight Scotch
whiskey, which must have scarified our stomach linings, were
in order when Bell and I were promoted to the rank of captain
of 1 June 1943. A copy of this very important document is
shown in the appendix. It was so important that we felt we
could celebrate with an easy conscience. Two bars instead of
one! The bars were practically floated into place upon our
epaulets. All this meant some degree of satisfaction and an

Autumn leaves began to fall; we changed to winter uniform;
the captain's bars had lost their luster when October, 1943,
slid along in the month parade. Its first week brought orders
to duty in the field, long awaited and long discussed. On October
5th I was assigned to the 37th Field Hospital, in training at
Camp Ellis, Illinois. I was to report "without delay." I did.
Marion went home to Mendota to "open up the house" for
the real war years.


I left Chicago, only regretting that the friendships with a
good group of medical officers and army nurses would be broken.
I said goodbye reluctantly to all of them. (See portfolio of
illustrations.) They scattered later to all parts of the world. To
the best of my knowledge all survived the war. Miss Stein later
was assigned to the 37th Field Hospital and was returned from
New Guinea due to illness. Miss, Charlotte Young fractured a
leg in Alaska and was returned to the States for a long period
of hospitalization. Charley Bell was almost caught in the Battle
of the Bulge, "but he heard the Germans were near and picked
up his petticoats and ran," fortunately.


The 37th Field Hospital, with a nucleus of administrative
officers and a full complement of corpsmen had been training
at Camp Ellis, Illinois, near Peoria, for several months. A regular
army officer, Major William T. Sichi, was in command. It was
a competent group, already well trained to treat medical and
surgical casualties in the field. The unit was periodically "hot,"
and we were aware that we would leave for foreign duty shortly.


Teaching of the corpsmen and physical conditioning occupied
most of our time. The long hikes into the surrounding country
helped to condition us, although we lost most of this conditioning
later aboard ship. Our nightly poker parties also served to
keep us "soft." But there was little else to do at this army camp
sprawled on the banks of the Spoon River. All were anxious
to take off for overseas duty.


Time seemed to pass slowly; the task of equipping a hospital
delayed our departure. We needed over two hundred tons of

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048379-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The phrase "unless sooner relieved" tempered my feelings
about going to the Mayo Clinic for this course of study. When
I reported there I was aware that it would be impossible to
complete the entire course. I was very interested in the subjects
and particularly in the methods of that great clinic at Rochester.
So I dug into study and clinical observation and daily watched
the mails for news from Camp Ellis, Illinois. During the last
week of January, 1944 the news came; it was contained in a
letter from Major Sichi.


I do not recall the entire content of the letter but I do recall
a sentence he used: "Your desire for action will shortly be
gratified." He instructed me to return to the unit at Camp Ellis.
We had been alerted for overseas duty. Expectant months of
waiting were ended; when these orders were received I was a
little reluctant to leave Rochester, as the course of study was so
interesting. But I recalled that Charley and I had often brayed
about foreign duty so I hurriedly left Rochester for Illinois. New,
more exciting adventure was around the corner, and I was
making the turn.
