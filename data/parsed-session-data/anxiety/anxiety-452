BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> Okay, that's it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b> No, but it's -
<b>PT:</b> If you think it's good, I'll do it.
<b>DR:</b> Thank you.  So you have a lot of confidence in me.
<b>PT:</b> I do.
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So we have to organize what happened last time.  
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> With her in the office.  Let me just remind us what you looked like when I saw you.
<b>PT:</b> You're the best.
<b>DR:</b> No.  Enough with the doom and gloom stuff.  You're fine.
<b>PT:</b> I am fine.
<b>DR:</b> You are fine.  You're mostly fine.
<b>PT:</b> Wait until I tell you what I think it is.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, I saw you [DATE].  You were withdrawn.  You were restricting activities.  You were somewhat sad, apathetic.  Your energy was low.  Your appetite was okay, no change in your weight.  Your sleep was fine.  No suicidality.   You were a bit overwhelmed.  Feeling febrile.  Self-esteem was low, feeling defective about your cardio problems.  Lots of anxiety, easily flustered.  So we thought your depressive illness was in reasonable remission on the Paxil and Provigil and as needed Ativan.  You may had this kind of neuropsychiatric syndrome with memory problems and whatever that we weren't quite sure.  Because it's not gone downhill quickly we weren't really sure what's going on.  We're happy to let it plateau -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> In whatever state it is.  All right and your daughter was here, we went through the ins and outs of where this might go and you know, whatever.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  What has happened since?
<b>PT:</b> Well it was yesterday.  I left my house.  I was totally, it starts in my head in the morning, okay?  It starts up here and it takes all day long for it to disappear.  This feeling of I don't know where I'm - I'm going but I'm not sure where I'm going.  I'm totally lost.
<b>DR:</b> So you get disoriented.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Every day.  Every morning.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Almost every morning.  Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And it's when you wake up.
<b>PT:</b> It's like this morning I decided to try and see what it could be.  Could it be anything in the Paxil?  And the Vesicare which I take for urinary, could that may be because that's, Detrol was the old one and I switched to Vesicare.  I take Lipitor and I take Lorazepam at night.
<b>DR:</b> Lorazepam at night so that should be out of your system.  What time at night do you take the Lorazepam?
<b>PT:</b> About eleven thirty.
<b>DR:</b> 'Cause Lorazepam could make you, put you in that almost drunken state.  But it shouldn't be by then.
<b>PT:</b> Doesn't towards the end of the day.
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  So we're going to discount the Lorazepam.  The Paxil, you've been on it for a long time and you're on it and off it and then on it again and they've never done that before.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So it doesn't make sense to me that it would.  Lipitor I'm not impressed.  Vesicare, I don't even know -
<b>PT:</b> Maybe that mixes with this or something.
<b>DR:</b> It shouldn't, but let me look it up.  You know how to spell it?
<b>PT:</b> V E S I C A R E.
<b>DR:</b> Has anyone else looked it up for you?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I just really thought of it because -
<b>DR:</b> V I S -
<b>PT:</b> V E S I C A R E.  I'm pretty sure.
<b>DR:</b> No, it's here.  Wait it is, it's anticholinergic.  
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Detrol.  If that's it, will I be thankful.
<b>DR:</b> Drowsiness and dizziness.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you very much.  I think this is about the first time, aside from Penicillin, that I've had an allergy.
<b>DR:</b> It's not an allergy, it's a real side effect.
<b>PT:</b> Wow.
<b>DR:</b> Especially in you.  It's, you know, it's an anticholinergic medicine which we know could frequently cause cognitive problems, can cause thinking problems.
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> So I think you should get off that medicine right away.
<b>PT:</b> Now what if I went on Detrol, another medication?
<b>DR:</b> Detrol's a little bit similar.
<b>PT:</b> It's amazing.  I don't think I was this way when I was on Detrol but I don't remember when I switched.  But it was around the beginning of December when this started.  
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] fibrillation. Do you have any cardiac problems?
<b>PT:</b> No.  Uh, sometimes when I take a Provigil um, I'll get -
<b>DR:</b> Detrol also, drowsiness, dizziness and blurred vision.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I guess I will try -
<b>DR:</b> Any way you can get away with not using any of these medicines?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> I would stay a good month off all of them and see.
<b>PT:</b> I will, I will.
<b>DR:</b> See, because yeah, in different context we see anticholinergics given cognitive problems all the time.
<b>PT:</b> Oh my gosh, yeah -
<b>DR:</b> We avoid them in people for whom we worry about how they're thinking.
<b>PT:</b> Well you can worry about how I'm thinking because I haven't, in a middle ground right now.  I'm hazy.  I'm dizzy.  I'm feeling out of it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> I'll call [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] and ask her what else I can do.
<b>DR:</b> Well for now though, 'cause it's not life threatening.  
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> The urinary issues are not life threatening.  
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely not.
<b>DR:</b> It's uncomfortable.  Get off them.  Get off all of those meds.  
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> And let's see how you do.
<b>PT:</b> Please God, let that be -
<b>DR:</b> I bet it is.  It'll be part of it for sure.  When do you take it?
<b>PT:</b> I take it at night.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And it's probably -
<b>DR:</b> You're sleeping through most of the side effects.
<b>PT:</b> It's supposed to react all through the day.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>PT:</b> It's supposed to be a twenty four hour.
<b>DR:</b> What's your mood been like?
<b>PT:</b> Um, the same thing.  I sort of, like this hazy kind of feeling.
<b>DR:</b> That's not a mood.  That's like a -
<b>PT:</b> Well it puts me sort of out of everything.
<b>DR:</b> So you're out of it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I mean -
<b>DR:</b> So it's more cognitive problems -
<b>PT:</b> I did go into a store and bought a pair of shoes and I went downstairs and I conducted myself nicely but I felt that there was something wrong with me.
<b>DR:</b> That's a cognitive thing.  Do you feel sad and anxious most of the time?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You do?  So your mood's not good.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Well it's not good 'cause I'm not doing anything.  I finally heard [DEIDENTIFIED] last night when I went to the [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> I heard him as his wife.  She's a smart lady but it was interesting.  But I was up until ten o'clock.  Came home and collapsed.  
<b>DR:</b> Are you sad?  I don't really wanna know why, I just wanna know what.  Are you sad?
<b>PT:</b> I'm sad and it's my -
<b>DR:</b> I know.  You're trying to tell me why.  I didn't ask why.  You feel sad most of the time.
<b>PT:</b> A lot of the time I do.  
<b>DR:</b> What percent of the time?
<b>PT:</b> Um, I think it has to do with me -
<b>DR:</b> I didn't ask why.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Because I'm not doing anything I do feel sad.
<b>DR:</b> I didn't ask why.  You're not allowed to say anything related to it.  I'm asking about how you feel most of the time.  How do you feel most of the time?  You're allowed to say okay.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Okay, I'm allowed to say okay?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But when you're not busy or unstructured or thinking about demoralizing things you feel bad.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> That's called normal.  
<b>PT:</b> Oh.
<b>DR:</b> That's called normal.  Okay?  You're supposed to have mood.  What you're not supposed to have is a mood that stuck in sadness or anxiety.  Are you stuck in sadness and anxiety most of the time?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Okay. But there are things that make you sad and anxious.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Like not having much to do, worrying about your memory, blah, blah, blah, family issues.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm sad because I don't have the ability to take myself down to the gym in our building.
<b>DR:</b> So you're very frustrated.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah because there are so many people around that maybe I'll make a mistake, and maybe they'll look at me.
<b>DR:</b> So it's your cognitive dysfunction.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're a bit frustrated and demoralized.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's upsetting.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  I'm sad because I don't go out to [NAME OTHER] and [NAME OTHER] a lot or to [NAME OTHER].  It's a ridiculous situation when I go out there because [NAME OTHER] said how about Saturday afternoon and [NAME OTHER] will take you home.  So that means a huge bus trip to go out there and I can't sleep over?  You know, she doesn't think to say well Mom, sleep over that night and you'll go home in the morning.  Say something.  
<b>DR:</b> Do you ever articulate that there?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  I did yesterday.  
<b>DR:</b> Maybe there's a reason.
<b>PT:</b> There is a reason.  I mean there are reasons.
<b>DR:</b> What was the reason?
<b>PT:</b> They're a very together couple which is incredible.  Um, and she doesn't need me sleeping over at night.  You know, she's not what I have or what I want.  [NAME OTHER] is doing meditation now.  I go out there.  The girls come home from school around three, three thirty, four o'clock.  I go out there at that point.  He doesn't come home until five thirty or six o'clock.  I stay, have a bite with him and get on the train and go home.  It's just a detachment from everybody you know?  
<b>DR:</b> So you'd like more?
<b>PT:</b> I would like more.
<b>DR:</b> You'd like more engagement with them, not just a visit.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'd like a conversation with them.  I'd like to talk to them.  And then I have nothing to say so it's difficult.  
<b>DR:</b> What do you mean you have nothing to say?
<b>PT:</b> I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Nothing comes to mind?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, especially with [NAME OTHER] cause I don't want to get into anything.
<b>DR:</b> Is that because you're anxious or because there's just not much there any more?
<b>PT:</b> I'm really, I guess I'm shy.  I guess I don't think of anything to say to him that's a little bit different or whatever.  I probably, that's because I do read the newspaper but I don't go out anywhere.  I'm not involved in anything that would give me the ability to talk to him.  I'm just the way I am.  You know I'm mostly a loner.  I don't know.  I mean even when we were married and lived in this marvelous place with a swimming pool and tennis court it would take me hours to get myself over there.  [NAME OTHER] would go 'cause he'd swim and he'd read the newspaper.  He was fine.  But that was not right, you know.  I was sort of keeping myself away until he called me and said to come over.
<b>DR:</b> You mean even years ago?
<b>PT:</b> Years ago.  Years ago.  
<b>DR:</b> Until [NAME OTHER] would call you, or [NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b> [NAME OTHER] would call me and say come on over, what's taking you so long?
<b>DR:</b> So you would be waiting for that call to say -
<b>PT:</b> Um, no, I would sort of, you know well maybe I could stay here, maybe he'll just come home.
<b>DR:</b> It's like a social anxiety.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Interesting.  Um, your appetite's okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's not great.  I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Are you sleeping?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Is your energy okay?
<b>PT:</b> Um, my energy is okay if I get myself out and go walking.
<b>DR:</b> The Provigil seems to help?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I took a half of it the other day 'cause I didn't know whether that could be it.  So I -
<b>DR:</b> I have these coupons you get seven free.
<b>PT:</b> Oh I like that.
<b>DR:</b> You like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] Oh, well let me see what I have to do.  I have to write a prescription for just seven of them.  You have a regular prescription, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> So let me write one for seven.  Um -
<b>PT:</b> I think more is coming out.
<b>DR:</b> Well Provigil, uh, won't be generic for a very long time.
<b>PT:</b> Right.  That's okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?  Are you covered?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  To this point I think it's gonna stop again.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Is that how it works?
<b>DR:</b> Well Medicare is complicated.
<b>PT:</b> It is so complicated and it's so cruel.
<b>DR:</b> Last time, yeah but no, they just gave the prescription thing up until recently there was no coverage, yeah.  So it's far better than it used to be.  The last time we tried changing your antidepressant all hell broke loose, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So even though, you know, I'm a little nervous that the Paxil could be causing some of your difficulties I very reluctantly would change your Paxil.  
<b>PT:</b> No, I -
<b>DR:</b> You're not, yeah.  Okay, as long as you're not hawking me to change it -
<b>PT:</b> No.  No, no, no, no, no.
<b>DR:</b> I'm not going to change it.
<b>PT:</b> I'm afraid.  I was like [INAUDIBLE] -
<b>DR:</b> I don't blame you.  Last time it was horrible.
<b>PT:</b> It was.
<b>DR:</b> It was horrible.  And probably for both the anxiety problem and the depressive problem.
<b>PT:</b> It's [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  I mean you relapsed in a big way into depression when we stopped that.
<b>PT:</b> I did.  
<b>DR:</b> All right.  So we're on 40 of Paxil.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hmm.
<b>DR:</b> 200 Provigil and Lorazepam as needed.  Try to minimize the Ativan, Lorazepam.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Just because that could give you some of these cognitive difficulties and spaciness.
<b>PT:</b> The only time that I really do take it is if I start to get anxious and I'm out, you know.  Then I'll sort of take one and then I'll take it at night.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because it does help me sleep.  
<b>DR:</b> You can keep taking it at night.
<b>PT:</b> I'm sure it's that when -
<b>DR:</b> No, that's a pretty good way to take it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Um, do you need prescriptions?
<b>PT:</b> I don't think so.
<b>DR:</b> If you need anything, just give us a call.  It's all here in the chart and we can call the pharmacy.  The one that we can't call and we have to give to you is the Lorazepam, the Ativan.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> The others we can just call in.
<b>PT:</b> Well you know what, this last [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Oh good, okay.
<b>PT:</b> He mails me the prescription and I go and fill it.
<b>DR:</b> We need to have you sign for this thing.  
<b>PT:</b> This is funny, he, I lost my glasses, my last pair as well as the pair before that.  So he now put these on a string so that I have them always.  
<b>DR:</b> Right where that X is.  Let me get you another pen.
<b>PT:</b> Oh, and my writing is terrible.
<b>DR:</b> Slower than it used to be?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> Well it's a little Parkinsonian but that's okay.  
<b>PT:</b> Really?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, it's common.  It's common as you get older.  Don't worry about it.
<b>PT:</b> I'll be just like my brother in law.  
<b>DR:</b> And there also.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> That X.
<b>PT:</b> I don't even know what I'm signing.
<b>DR:</b> You're signing that it's okay for us to -
<b>PT:</b> You're gonna commit me.
<b>DR:</b> No, I'm signing that we're gonna put your face on the evening news.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, should I sign here?
<b>DR:</b> Yes.  Right above the X, right next to the X.
