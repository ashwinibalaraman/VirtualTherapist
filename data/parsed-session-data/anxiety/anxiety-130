<font size="4"><b>21: Directions in Teaching Social Skills to Students with 

Specific EBDs</b></font>

HELEN MCGRATH


Gresham (1997) has argued that a lack of social competence virtually defines
an emotional and behavioural disorder (EBD). Social competence is the
extent to which a student can initiate and maintain positive relationships with
both classmates and teachers, gain social acceptance from their peers, make
satisfying friendships, and terminate negative or disadvantaging social associations
(Gresham, 2000). This chapter focuses on the identified specific social
learning needs of students with the EBDs of attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, conduct disorder, or one of the several anxiety disorders. The effectiveness
of teaching social skills to students with EBDs as a supportive intervention
is also discussed. A feature of the chapter is the manner in which
detailed use has been made of the literature in order to scope the extent of
work in this aspect of EBD  but also to exemplify its complexity.


Students with EBDs are more likely to demonstrate negative, withdrawn,
conflicted or otherwise ineffective patterns of social interaction.
Their social behaviour often leads those with whom they interact socially
to respond initially with discomfort, anger or avoidance and, eventually,
with rejection (Shores and Wehby, 1999). Ongoing peer rejection then
places those students at greater risk for adverse social, academic and mental
health consequences. The likely short-term outcomes of unsatisfying
peer relationships include increased aggression and antisocial behaviour,
truancy, substance abuse, low academic achievement, depression and

[p. <i>328</i>]

Their social difficulties also adversely impact on their development of
friendships. These students may make friends initially, but often lack the
skills needed to keep them (Miller-Johnson et al., 1999). Gresham et al.
(1997) found that only about 20 percent of children in grade 3 who were
designated as at risk for EBDs had one or more friends in a typical class-room,
compared to 50 percent in a matched control group. A lack of satisfying
friendship experiences not only leads to a decreased frequency of
positive social interactions, but also to lower levels of academic task completion
(Newcomb and Bagwell, 1995). Lack of opportunities to engage in
ongoing friendship behaviours also has implications for students' socio-moral
development. Friendship provides opportunities for the participants
to disagree more in a safe way, learn about perspective-taking, debate
socio-moral issues and make decisions about moral dilemmas, all of which
provokes changes in socio-moral thinking (Schonert-Reichl, 1993).


<b>NEW DIRECTIONS</b>


Sugai et al. (2000) have argued for the replacement of the more typical
punitive and exclusionary approach to the management of the behaviour
of students with EBDs with one characterized by a school-wide programme
of positive behaviour support. Such an approach focuses more
on positive interventions, such as rewards for appropriate behaviour,
improved teaching strategies to maximize student engagement, environmental
changes (for example, furniture and room reorganization), the creation
of a prosocial classroom culture, and the direct teaching of social
skills (Sugai and Horner, 2002). The direct teaching of social skills has
been the most researched of these initiatives.


Most reviewers of studies investigating the effectiveness of social skills
programmes in improving social outcomes for at-risk students have
concluded that there is much empirical support for the positive impact of
a great variety of social skills training programmes (Gresham, 1998;
Hepler, 1998; Hermann and McWhirter, 1997). However, Gresham (1997)
has also noted that there is an enormous variation in the effect sizes (0.20
to 0.50) across more recent meta-analyses of research on the effectiveness
of social skills programmes. In general, research has also suggested that

<b>A MODEL OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR</b>


Several social information processing models have been proposed to
explain social behaviour (Dodge and Price, 1994). Dodge's (1986) model
was initially developed more to explain aggressive behaviour in children,
rather than all social behaviour. The five processes in his model are:


 the encoding of social cues;


 their interpretation;


 the generation of potential responses;


 their evaluation; and


 the enactment of the selected response.


An alternative, more general model of social behaviour is proposed
below to explain the process of general social behaviour. Students with
specific EBDs may have deficits in one or more of the following processes:


 accessing social knowledge/social memory;


 applying personal values;


 social cognition (that is, recognition of social cues, intention detection,
empathy, emotional regulation, goal selection, social problem solving
consequential thinking, and social self-efficacy assessment);


 social skill enactment; and


 social self-reflection (monitoring of immediate responses and later
analysis and reflection).


<b>Accessing social knowledge</b>


<b>and social memory</b>


The student accesses their current knowledge of culturally appropriate social
expectations and social rules, and of the social skills which are consistent with
those expectations and rules. They also access their memory of previous
similar social encounters.


<b>Applying personal values</b>


The student recalls and applies their personal socio-moral values (or lack
thereof) to the social situation. Values are predominantly:

[p. <i>330</i>]

<i>Prosocial</i> (that is, focused on enhancing relationships and respecting
the rights and feelings of others).


<i>Antisocial</i> (that is, focused on personal gain in violation of the rules and
social expectations of the community and irrespective of the negative
impact on others).


<i>Non-social</i> (that is, focused on personal gain but not necessarily
through the violation of societal rules or the violation of rights).


<b>Social cognition</b>


Many different social cognitive processes are then applied as part of the
student's analysis of the social cues and resultant selection of response.
Some of these are:


<i>Recognition of social cues:</i> the student identifies and integrates the
social cues in the situation, that is, any combination of the context and
other people's words, actions and non-verbal features such as voice tone
and facial expression.


<i>Intention detection:</i> the student decides whether the other person's
intentions towards them are hostile (for example, they want to make me
look stupid or beat me at the game no matter what it takes) or benign
(for example, they want to be friends or they want to get to know me).


<i>Empathy:</i> the student takes the perspective of the other person to try
to understand their views and feelings in order to respond appropriately
(for example, are they feeling lonely? Do they seem nervous that I
might not like them?).


<i>Emotional regulation:</i> the student recognizes and names the feelings
they are experiencing in response to the social cues and the social setting
(especially anger and anxiety) and finds ways to regulate them
(that is, calm down) so that they don't overwhelm rational thought and
inhibit appropriate social responses.


<i>Social goal selection:</i> on the basis of their personal values and the
reading of the social situation, the student decides what they want to
achieve from the social encounter. Possible <i>positive</i> and <i>prosocial</i>
goals are: getting on well with the other person, having a good time,
maintaining a positive social reputation, keeping out of trouble, getting
to know someone, finding a peaceful solution and maintaining a
friendship. Possible <i>negative</i> and <i>antisocial</i> goals are: retaliation, winning
at all costs, manipulating someone to get what you want, and
maintaining a reputation as someone socially dominant and/or tough
and intimidating. Possible <i>self-protective</i> or <i>non-social</i> goals are:
safety and avoidance, and controlling everything that happens in the
encounter.

[p. <i>331</i>]

<i>Social problem solving</i>: the student generates possible alternative
social responses and strategies to achieve their goal using their social
knowledge and social memory as the data base.


<i>Consequential thinking</i>: the student predicts the potential positive and
negative outcomes of each possible response before deciding on the
most effective one to use.


<i>Social self-efficacy assessment</i>: the student assesses whether or not
they have enough skill and confidence to enact the selected skill.


<b>Social skill enactment</b>


The student enacts the chosen social skill to achieve their selected goal. A
skill involves a combination of words and actions as well as non-verbal
features, such as smiling (or lack of it), type of eye contact, and facial
expressions.


<b>Monitoring of responses and</b>


<b>social self-reflection</b>


There are two parts to this process. The first is <i>immediate self-reflection</i>, in
which the student monitors and interprets the reactions of others and adjusts
their next response accordingly. The second is <i>long-term self-reflection</i>, in
which, at a later point, the student mentally replays (or talks to others about)
the social encounter and evaluates the effectiveness of their own performance
in terms of the goals they selected. At this later point they also make attributions
for the success or failure of the social enactment (for example, a rebuff
or humiliation is attributed to either internal factors (for example, ability) or
external factors (for example, the other person's bad mood). This information
is then added to their store of social knowledge and their social memory, and
becomes part of the data base for the next similar social skill enactment.


<b>ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY</b>


<b>DISORDER (ADHD)</b>


ADHD is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or
hyperactivity/impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically
observed in individuals at a comparable level of development (APA, 1994).


<i>Inattention</i> refers to difficulties in focusing and sustaining appropriate
attention. It contributes to distractibility, high rates of off-task behaviour,
disorganization and a lack of persistence on tasks (Barkley, 1990).


<i>Impulsivity</i> refers to behavioural disinhibition and reflects difficulties
in controlling both behaviour and thoughts. It results in difficulties such

[p. <i>332</i>]

<i>Hyperactivity</i> involves excessive and inappropriate levels of activity,
such as moving around, fidgeting and talking.


Students with ADHD are usually not appealing to classmates or friends
and are often unpopular (Farmer et al., 1999). They evoke negative reactions
from peers and teachers because of their annoying, boisterous,
intractable and irritating social behaviour (Landau and Moore, 1991) and
classmates are more aware of them than other peers in a negative way
(Grizenko et al., 1993). Their emotional volatility and behaviour often
create frequent conflicts and confrontations. Their reputation amongst
peers is often one of aggression and immaturity, characterized by relatively
uninhibited behaviour and non-compliance with rules of both classroom
and playground (Dulcan and Benson, 1997).


The social picture of a typical student with ADHD (combined type) is
based more on boys than girls, because research has focused almost exclusively
on boys, most likely as a result of the disproportionately high
number of boys with ADHD compared to girls (Barkley, 1990). Studies
suggest that approximately 50 per cent of students with ADHD have poor
social functioning and are rejected by their peers (Hinshaw et al., 1997).
Peer rejection of students with ADHD tends to be maintained across new
peer groups and time (Guevremont, 1990), and many of their social difficulties
persist into young adulthood, affecting both their heterosocial
competencies and their employability.


The ADHD subtype predicts significant differences in social outcomes.
Three subtypes of ADHD have been identified. The first type is characterized
predominantly by inattention, the second by hyperactive/impulsivity, and
the third is a combined type that has features of all three, that is, inattention,
impulsivity and hyperactivity (APA, 1994). The majority of students diagnosed
with ADHD are in the category of combined type (APA, 1994).


Students who are predominantly inattentive are more likely to have
a deficit of positive social skills and are more likely to be socially
withdrawn and ignored or neglected (Dumas, 1998). On the other hand,
students with ADHD who are characterized by either just impulsiveness
or impulsivity plus inattentiveness appear to be at greater risk of peer
rejection than students with just attention difficulties (Carlson et al.,
1987). Such students are more likely to display an excess of negative
social behaviours and hence become socially uncomfortable for peers to
associate with. It may take only one demonstration of uncontrolled anger

[p. <i>333</i>]

Students in the combined type category are also more likely to have a comorbid
conduct disorder than those who are just inattentive and disorganized.
Adolescents with a dual diagnosis of ADHD and conduct disorder
experience even greater social problems than adolescents with only
ADHD (Biederman et al., 1996). In one study, Weiss et al. (1985) found
that parents of children with ADHD reported that 30 percent of their
children had few steady friends.


Their frequency of social interaction of students with ADHD appears to
be much the same as for their peers (Cunningham and Siegal, 1987;
Hinshaw et al., 1989, but they are more likely to exhibit verbal and physical
aggression towards peers, be less compliant with rules, be loud and
disruptive, talk rapidly and excessively (especially when on-task behaviour
is required), be argumentative and stubborn, show lower levels of cooperation
and peer compliance, offer less assistance to peers, and be less
able to share and wait patiently for their turn (Barkley, 1990). They are
also more likely to be more domineering and controlling with peers (Clark
et al., 1988) and be more critical of and negative towards others (Dumas,
1998). They use ineffective and less reciprocal communication, often to
the point of ignoring peer overtures (Dumas, 1998). They tend to be more
oppositional and defiant with teachers and other adults (Dumas, 1998).
Their impulsivity often leads to their speaking without thinking and hence
saying thoughtless or negative things to peers or teachers, and intruding
on others' boundaries (Barkley, 1990).


The negative social behaviour of students with ADHD appears to have a
contagion effect on their non-ADHD classmates. Classmates are less
likely to co-operate and more likely to be off-task when in the company of
students with ADHD. They also respond to classmates with ADHD with
their own counter-controlling and noncompliant responses. Cunningham
and Siegal (1987) have speculated that classmates start to avoid students
with ADHD partly to avoid responding with negative behaviours of their
own and getting into trouble when doing so.


<b>The specific social difficulties of</b>


<b>students with ADHD</b>


Table 21.1 (column 1) outlines possible strategies for each area of social difficulty
experienced by students with ADHD, after applying the social
behaviour model mentioned earlier in the article.

<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000013190-I0018&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<b>Social knowledge and social memory</b>


Students with ADHD display less knowledge about socially appropriate
and agreeable behaviour (especially the importance of being positive, co-operative
and compliant and being fair in games and activities). They also
have less knowledge about effective communication and conversation and
conflict management (Carlson et al., 1987; Grenell et al., 1987).

[p. <i>335</i>]

<b>Personal values</b>


ADHD students are less likely to demonstrate behaviours which reflect an
endorsement of the prosocial values of co-operation and respect for the
rights and feelings of others.


<b>Social cognition</b>


Students with ADHD who are aggressive tend to have poor intention
detection skills and misattribute hostile intentions to others, especially in
ambiguous social situations (Milich and Dodge, 1984). Such a bias
increases the likelihood that peers will retaliate aggressively and deliver
defensive rejecting responses. Impulsivity and inattention often lead to a
failure on the part of the ADHD student to collect all the relevant information
and social cues and to then jump to conclusions. Students with
ADHD also show high levels of uncontrolled emotionality, explosiveness
and moodiness (Barkley, 1990), and it is less satisfying to have a
friendship with someone whose behaviour is unpredictable (Dumas,
1998). Poor social problem-solving ability is also a common characteristic
of these students (Dodge and Coie, 1987; Guevremont and Foster,
1993), as is a reduced ability to accurately anticipate the consequences of
using socially coercive behaviour (Dodge and Coie, 1987). They are
more likely to choose goals of retaliation and winning at all costs over
goals of relationship enhancement or staying friends.


<b>Social skill enactment</b>


The three broad areas of socially skilful behaviour that have been identified
as problematic for students with ADHD are: peer social communication,
peer co-operation, and conflict management. Although these skills may in
part arise from a poor social knowledge base, they are also likely to reflect
poor skill enactment.


Students with ADHD are likely to use ineffective general social communication.
For example, they show low levels of verbal reciprocity and
often do not respond to peer verbal initiations (Dumas, 1998). They tend
to use less co-operative communication (Bickett and Milich, 1990) and
are less competent at explaining things to others (Carlson et al., 1987). In
particular they use poor conversational skills, with their style of conversation
being characterized by poor listening, interruptions, monopolizing
of the conversation, a disorganized style of thoughts and responses, and
constant changing of the topic of conversation (Carlson et al., 1987).
Dumas (1998) has suggested that ADHD symptoms may contribute even

[p. <i>336</i>]

<b>Social self-reflection</b>


Students with ADHD appear to have a more inflexible social style. They are
less able to adjust what they say and do to the demands of the situation
(Landua and Milich, 1988), suggesting that they are inattentive, do not
monitor others' responses and social cues well and hence do not rethink and
adjust their social behaviour as they go. They are more likely to blame
social failure on external factors, such as the other person's perceived
ill-intended behaviour (Dodge, Bates and Pettit, 1990).


<b>CONDUCT DISORDER</b>


Students with conduct disorder exhibit a persistent pattern of behaviour
that violates the basic rights of others and major age-appropriate social
norms. They are frequently engaged in antisocial behaviours such as
aggression, stealing, fighting, lying, cheating, bullying and destruction of
property (APA, 1994). Some students with a diagnosis of conduct disorder
are aggressive and hostile. Others are glib and charming and more difficult
to detect (McGrath and Edwards, 2000).


Students with conduct disorders who are also aggressive have particular
difficulties in forming and maintaining friendships with peers and are
more likely than other students to experience peer rejection (Coie, 1990).
Hinshaw et al. (1997) found that antisocial behaviours such as stealing
and property destruction also predicted peer rejection. Such difficulties
appear still to be apparent in adolescence (Campbell, 1990).


The social picture of a conduct disordered student who is aggressive is
one characterized by lack of co-operative behaviour, attempts to dominate
and intimidate peers, verbal and physical aggression towards peers, bullying,
lying, stealing from peers, and destruction of peer property. On the

[p. <i>337</i>]

Table 21.1 (column 2) outlines possible strategies for each area of
social difficulty experienced by conduct disordered students after applying
the social behaviour model mentioned earlier in this chapter.


<b>Social knowledge and social memory</b>


Young children with conduct disorders have fewer positive social skills,
engage in more destructive conflict and have limited knowledge of social
expectations and skills related to co-operation, shared play and conflict
management (Webster-Stratton and Lindsay, 1999). They also have less
knowledge about effective strategies for social entry. These deficits
appear to continue over time (Campbell, 1990).


<b>Personal values</b>


Antisocial values are reflected in the behaviour of students with a conduct
disorder and the social goals they select.


<b>Social cognitions</b>


Aggressive conduct disordered students are limited in their perspective
taking skills and, hence, in empathy (Webster-Stratton and Lindsay,
1999). They also tend to misattribute hostile intentions to others (Coie,
1990) and to selectively attend to aggressive social cues more than to
nonaggressive cues (Milich and Dodge, 1984). They have access to
fewer social problem-solving strategies. They are more likely to choose
the goal of retaliation or dominance and hence enact coercive responses
or solutions. Chung and Asher (1997) found that aggression was the
preferred strategy of conduct disordered students to deal with a hypothetical
conflict situation if retaliation was selected as the prime goal.
However, when they select aggression as the social option, they usually
fail to anticipate the negative consequences of their choice. Lochman,
Coie et al. (1993) demonstrated that boys who chose dominance and
revenge as their main goals in hypothetical social situations went on to
have a stronger history of criminal activity and substance misuse.
Erdley and Asher (1999) have argued that conduct disordered students
are more likely to choose as their first goal, the one for which they have

[p. <i>338</i>]

<b>Social skill enactment</b>


Students with conduct disorders are more likely to lack the skills of
approaching and joining peers in a positive way (Dodge et al., 1983),
giving positive feedback and starting a conversation (Coie et al., 1990).
Younger children with a conduct disorder lack positive play skills, such
as offering assistance and playing co-operatively (Ladd et al., 1990).


<b>Social self-reflection</b>


Lynam (1996) has suggested that conduct disordered students fail to
attend to shifts in social cues. For example, if a peer moved from conflict
to placation (for example, by apologising or acting in a friendly manner)
they would be likely to continue in a confrontational manner. They also
overestimate their own social competence with peers (Webster-Stratton
and Lindsay, 1999). Their tendency not to report being lonely perhaps
reflects their inability to accurately detect the negative social response of
others (Webster-Stratton and Lindsay, 1999).


<b>ANXIETY DISORDER</b>


Students with a generalized anxiety disorder worry excessively about
many areas of their life, such as school work, family, friends, health,
travel and any new situation (APA, 1994). Students with social phobia are
very anxious about social or performance situations in which they are
exposed to unfamiliar people and evaluation. They fear that they will act
in a way that will result in humiliation or embarrassment and hence negative
evaluation from others (APA, 1994). Children with separation anxiety
disorder have excessive anxiety about separation from parents,
especially their mother (APA, 1994).


Children with internalizing disorders, such as social phobia, generalized
anxiety or separation anxiety, also tend to have impaired social relationships,
have difficulty making friends, are socially withdrawn and have a
lower frequency of social interactions than their peers. They tend to be
socially ignored rather than rejected, but their anxiety often leads to their
becoming the targets of bullying (Olweus, 1991; Rigby and Slee, 1992).


Table 21.1 (column 3) outlines possible strategies for each area of
social difficulty experienced by anxious students (especially those with

[p. <i>339</i>]

<b>Social knowledge/social memory</b>


Anxious students do not appear to have specific social knowledge deficits.
However, their social memories are more likely to emphasize their own
social failures more than any social successes (Morris et al., 2002).


<b>Personal values</b>


This does not seem to be particularly relevant for the social difficulties of
anxious students.


<b>Social cognition</b>


Anxious students tend to select the goal of avoidance or safety rather than
relationship-enhancing goals. Whilst they do not misattribute hostile
intention to others, they do tend to perceive that others are evaluating
them negatively, and selectively attend to cues suggesting the other
person is critical or contemptuous of them. They have great difficulty in
regulating their anxiety in social situations, especially those students with
social phobia.


<b>Social skill enactment</b>


Maag (1992) has advocated the use of stress inoculation training to help
anxious students to improve their social effectiveness. Baker and
Edelmann (2002) concluded that adults with social phobia had two major
enactment deficits, which are possibly present also in students with the
same disorder  they displayed excessive gaze aversion and had many
more filled (for example, er and um) and unfilled (silent) pauses
during conversation.


<b>Social self-reflection</b>


Poorly-accepted anxious students tend to attribute social successes to
external factors (for example, the friendliness of the other person), and
social failures to internal factors, such as their own social ineptitude
(Kendall and Chu, 2002; Morris et al., 2002). They are highly self-critical
and many become depressed because of what they perceive to be their
social failures and lack of confidence. Their readiness to withdraw from

[p. <i>340</i>]

<b>CO-MORBIDITY</b>


Emotional and behavioural problems tend to co-occur (Tankersley and
Landrum, 1997). Between 50 to 80 percent of students diagnosed with
ADHD also suffer from a co-morbid condition, usually another externalizing
disorder such as conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or
both (Scahill et al., 1999). Approximately 25 percent of students with ADHD
also have a co-morbid anxiety disorder (Angold et al., 1999). So for many
students the social difficulties are more complex.


<b>SOCIAL SKILLS PROGRAMMES</b>


The outcomes of recent research studies suggest the following guidelines
for incorporating programme features that are most likely to lead to the
success of social skills programmes:


 Social skills programmes should be whole-class based, taught by
teachers and embedded in the regular curriculum.


 The most effective model is one based on a direct social skills training
(DSST) model, with some elements of social cognitive training (SCT).


 Social skills programmes need to be appealing and acceptable to
teachers.


 Restructuring the classroom culture and physical environment to make
them more prosocial is also a necessary element.


 Cultural sensitivity is necessary.


 The teaching of social skills should start as early as possible.


 There should be some match between the social skills and social cognitions
taught in the programme and the specific social difficulties of
at-risk students.


 There should be plans for the generalization of learned social skills
across settings and maintenance over time.


 Social skills programmes are an additional component to a preventative
treatment plan, not a complete replacement.


 Strategies for changing a student's negative social reputation should
be included in any social skills programme.


 Developing positive associations with non-deviant peer groups is
important for students with ADHD or conduct disorder.

[p. <i>341</i>]

 Peer-mediated strategies can add power to an intervention.


 Other behaviour management strategies need to be incorporated.


Although many of the earlier research studies into the teaching of social
skills investigated programmes delivered in small groups by non-school
personnel, there is now a strong push for programmes to be whole-school
based and embedded in the regular curriculum. There are many powerful
arguments for the idea that social skills programmes are best implemented
by teachers in the school setting, preferably in a non-withdrawal context
(Hops and Greenwood, 1988). Schools are the most significant places in
which students develop the type of social skills which are particularly
important for peer acceptance at different ages and stages (Gresham, 1988)
and it makes little sense to decontextualize the teaching of social skills
(Gresham, 1997).


Classroom-based programmes are also more attractive to children than
infrequent interactions on a withdrawal basis with an unfamiliar counselor
or specialist, and the stigmatization which is often associated with
outside referral is avoided (Weissberg et al., 1981). A school-based programme
is also more cost-effective, in that, once trained, teachers can continue
to use newly-acquired skills with other students (McGrath, 1996).


Walker et al. (1995) have argued that the selected model of social skills
training, in which children are trained in small withdrawal groups, inhibit
generalization and does not address the issue of reputation. A classroom-based
social skills programme offers a greater likelihood of producing
generalization and maintenance of programme effects through the provision
of naturalistic opportunities to practise and receive naturalistic reinforcement
from real-life peers and a wide range of teachers (Maag, 1990).
Gresham (1997) has, however, noted that it might be more effective for
some students to start with a selected programme (that is, small group programme)
and then move to a whole-class universal programme (that is,
one taught to all students) where the same skills are reinforced.


One significant factor that must be considered in the implementation of
whole-class social skills programmes is whether or not the programmes
selected are acceptable to teachers in terms of appropriateness, fairness,
time and effort required, and intrusiveness (Witt and Elliott, 1985).
Unacceptable interventions are less likely to be implemented or implemented
correctly (1985). There needs to be some realistic expectation that
the social outcomes for the at-risk students will be worth the time, cost
and effort. Outcomes need to be socially important or valid, that is, make
a difference to a student's overall social behaviour with classmates and
teachers, create a more positive social reputation, lead to perceptions of
greater social competence by teachers, produce improved peer acceptance,
and enhance friendships (Gresham, 1997).

[p. <i>342</i>]

Teacher commitment must be ensured if a programmes is to succeed
(McGrath, 1996), and substantial school support and resources are
required (Rotheram-Borus et al., 2001). Teachers need training to acquire
skills to teach the programme and need to be reasonably socially competent
themselves (2001). They also need to be aware of the theoretical
framework that underpins a social skills programme.


<b>THE DIRECT SOCIAL SKILLS</b>


<b>TRAINING (DSST) AND SOCIAL</b>


<b>COGNITIVE TRAINING (SCT) MODELS</b>


The most researched programmes for teaching social skills are direct
social skills training (DSST) programmes and social cognitive training
(SCT) programmes. In DSST programmes, social skills are directly taught
by a process which usually involves an initial discussion of the skill which
stresses why it is a useful skill to have, verbal rehearsal of the steps of the
skill, structured opportunities to practise the newly-learned skill (usually
through role plays), and corrective feedback and reinforcement for correct
usage of the skill (Ladd and Mize, 1983). On the other hand, SCT programmes
have predominantly focused on the teaching of social problem-solving
skills using mostly hypothetical social situations.


Overall, most researchers have found that a DSST model produces the
most socially valid changes (for example, McGrath and Francey, 1988), and
that an SCT intervention is the least likely to produce such changes (for
example, Zaragoza et al., 1991). Many researchers have suggested that one
reason for the relative ineffectiveness of SCT programmes is that the way in
which children respond in hypothetical situations of social problem solving,
which allows time for reflective cognition, may be very different from the
ways in which they actually respond in real-life or semi-naturalistic situations
when emotional arousal factors and self-interest factors are more likely to be
present (for example, Richard and Dodge, 1982).


However, there should be <i>some</i> component of social cognitive training
in any programme. This should focus not only on social problem solving
as in the past, but also on the teaching of such social cognitive skills as
emotional regulation, intention detection, empathy, consequential thinking
and positive self-efficacy. Erdley (1996) has suggested that it is
especially important to teach positive and relationship-enhancing goal
selection, and to try to eliminate the retaliation goal, as this has been
shown to be the strongest predictor of aggression. Since about one half of
the attempts by most children to join others in a typical day are rebuffed
(Corsaro, 1981; Putallaz and Gottman, 1981), there also needs to be a

[p. <i>343</i>]

Programmes which are predominantly based on a DSST model but
which include a diverse range of social cognitive strategies can be pack-aged
in a relatively structured and clearly outlined curriculum to make
them attractive and user-friendly for teachers (for example, McGrath and
Francey, 1991; McGrath and Noble, 2003).


Poor peer acceptance is a function of both the behaviour of an individual
student and the social system in which they interact (La Greca, 1993;
Schneider, 1993). Higher levels of classroom cohesion can create a context
of acceptance that allows students more comfortably to change their behaviour.
A more relationship-enhancing classroom culture can be developed
through the use of co-operative learning classroom meetings, alternative
seating arrangements and so on. The teaching of prosocial moral values, such
as co-operation, support and concern for others, acceptance of differences,
inclusion, respect, honesty, fairness and responsibility, should also be a component
of this process (McGrath and Noble, 2003). There are only a few
research studies in this area so far (for example, Tyron and Keane, 1991),
few of which have yet demonstrated that changing the social ecology of a
classroom affects more direct measures of social behaviour or peer acceptance.
However, it is not logical to attempt to teach students social behaviour
which is not encouraged by the social ecology of the classroom and school
(Ogilvy, 1994). It is also important to ensure that the teaching of social skills
is culturally sensitive, as social interactions are always value-laden.


<b>KEY ISSUES IN THE TEACHING</b>


<b>OF SOCIAL SKILLS</b>


<b>Early identification</b>


Severson and Walker (2002) have argued strongly that early identification
is essential for children who demonstrate patterns of aggressive, inappropriate
or withdrawn social behaviour that suggest that they are at-risk for
later problematic behaviour and peer rejection. They suggest that this
should begin at age four or five so that early prevention can be started.
Many learning and social/behavioural problems are progressive in nature,
and schools need to focus strongly on prevention and early intervention
(O'Shaughnessy et al., 2002).


Misattribution of intentions has been identified in children as young as
four (Webster-Stratton and Lindsay, 1999). Patterson et al. (1992) suggest

[p. <i>344</i>]

<b>Match between social skills and cognitions taught</b>


<b>and the social difficulties of the EBD student</b>


The social difficulties, and hence the social learning needs, of students
with EBDs are not homogeneous. A one size fits all approach is less
likely to be effective. There needs to be some match between the social
learning needs of the at-risk student and what is taught (Gresham, 2002).
In their review of research, McIntosh et al. (1991) concluded that those
studies that had matched the teaching intervention to each students' specific
social skills deficits were more likely to produce positive results.


<b>Generalization of learned social skills across</b>


<b>settings and maintenance over time</b>


Students need enough practice to ensure that they become so fluent in
those newly-learned social skills that they becomes a reliable part of their
repertoire (Gresham, 1997). Opportunities should be planned and organized
for students to practise across a variety of settings and peers. This
may involve mixing up small groups of students within the same class,
working and playing with other classes or schools, using buddy systems
and so on.


<b>Social skills programmes should be an <i>additional</i></b>


<b>component to a preventative treatment plan</b>


In the case of some students, there will still be a need to address academic
needs too, as these can affect social behaviour (Gresham, 1997). There
should also be plans to analyse competing behaviours (for example, social

[p. <i>345</i>]

<b>Strategies for changing negative social</b>


<b>reputation should be included</b>


A student's reputation can best be described as the social expectations
others hold of them. However, labelling by peers can have the effect of
maintaining negative peer status and social reputation, even when behavioural
patterns that in the past have contributed to that reputation have been
eliminated (Asher, 1991). The same social behaviour can also receive a
positive response when exhibited by a high-status student, but a negative
response when exhibited by a low-status student (Dodge, 1983). Rejected
children are more likely to be held to be personally responsible for their
negative peer interactions, which are seen by peers as intentional and as the
results of stable personal dispositions (Waas and Honer, 1990). How much
change does there need to be for classmates and teachers to notice and then
slowly change their opinion of a child's reputation (Gresham, 1997)?
Sechrest et al. (1996) argue that the difference needs to be large enough to
be noticed by others without prompting. Putallaz (1982) has suggested
training poorly accepted children to anticipate and cope with potential rejection
from peers when they attempt to practise newly-learned social skills.
Another approach would be to directly teach a student's peers to perceive
others in more differentiated and positive ways, or arrange successful and
repeated opportunities for positive social interaction (Hymel et al., 1990).


<b>Positive associations with peer group</b>


One of the reasons why students do not generalize a newly-learned social
skill into a different but relevant social context may be because they continue
to affiliate with like-minded students who support their antisocial or
nonsocial goal selections and perceptions (Mathur and Rutherford, 1996).
Several researchers have demonstrated that aggressive children with

[p. <i>346</i>]

<b>Peer-mediated strategies can support</b>


<b>teacher intervention</b>


Peer-mediated social skills strategies involve creating a classroom social
environment which encourages and promotes positive interactions
between classmates by structuring activities and instructing students to
interact in particular ways with isolated or disruptive students. Involving
peers in a naturalistic social environment is an effective strategy for developing
generalization and maintenance of newly-learned social behaviours
(Gresham, 1997). Peers can also be taught to reinforce the practice of
prosocial behaviours by peers. In one study, a peer-monitoring procedure
was used by five-year-old children who gave tokens to eight classmates
for following classroom rules, such as cleaning up after play and waiting
their turn. Children with three tokens a day could vote on and participate
in play activities (Carden-Smith and Fowler, 1983).


<b>Other behaviour management strategies</b>


<b>should be incorporated</b>


The use of group contingencies means that the improved social behaviour
of certain class members determines the consequences received by the
entire group (Williamson et al., 1992). This works best when the rest of
the class is well behaved. For example, when a targeted student has earned
five points, then the whole class gets a 10-minute free-conversation time.


<b>CONCLUSION</b>


Positive peer relations, social acceptance and the resulting positive self-image
play an important role in self-control of aggressive impulses and
the internalization of societal morality as well as increasing resilience
(Dumas, 1998). Research so far suggests that significant positive changes
in social behaviour and peer relationships can be made if an effective
social skills intervention is used and if it is located in a prosocial and
positive learning culture.
