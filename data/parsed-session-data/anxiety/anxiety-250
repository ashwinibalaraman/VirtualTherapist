<font size="4"><b>Chapter 4: Psychosocial Status of Children and Youths</b></font>

According to the 1990 census, 36% of the 7.44 million Asian Ameri~cans
in the United States are age 19 years or under (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1991a, 1991b). Of these 2.7 million children, 22% are preschool
children (age 4 years or under), 40% are elementary or middle school children
(ages 5-13 years), 17% are of high school age (ages 14-17 years), and 20%
are of college age (18-22 years). Approximately 35% of these children are foreign
born. Although there are slightly more females than males in the general
Asian American population (51% vs. 49%), the reverse is true for the children
and youth population; males outnumber females in every age group by approximately
3%.


This chapter appraises the status of these children and youths through a review
of the relevant research literature, government reports, and various print
media. First, there is a review of what is known about the experiences of Asian
American children and youths during their formative years. Second, findings regarding
the psychological status of Asian American children and youths are summarized.
The third section of this chapter examines how these children and youths
are perceived by others within U.S. society and the impact these perceptions may
have on their adjustment. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the necessary
directions in research if we are to better understand the status of Asian American
children and youths.

<b>EXPERIENCES OF ASIAN AMERICAN
CHILDREN AND YOUTHS</b>


This section deals with the lives of Asian American children and youths in the
context of their home, school, and social milieus. Thus, their experiences are
discussed under the following topics: parent-child relationships, parental attitudes
toward schooling, peer group influences, and the social and economic milieus.
Within each of these topics, the unique experiences of Asian American
ethnic groups are presented as necessary. To the extent possible, however, the
commonalties of these groups are emphasized.


<b><i>Parent-Child Relationships</i></b>


In all families, regardless of background, the parent-child relationship and
sibling relationships have a great impact on children's development. Under the
most facilitative of circumstances, families serve as a secure base to which children
can turn for support and help. It is commonly the case that as children grow up,
especially during adolescence, parent-child conflicts increase because parents impose
their expectations on children's activities contrary to children's striving for
greater autonomy. In Asian American families, especially those in which the parents
are immigrants, the conflicts often are greater because many parents adhere
to traditional values of their homeland, whereas their children, who are eager to
become Americanized, are influenced strongly by the American value system (Chan
&amp; Leong, 1994; Chen, 1989; Dinh, Sarason, &amp; Sarason, 1994; Lee &amp; Eng, 1989;
Szapocznik &amp; Kurtines, 1993; Yu, 1984). Conflicts can arise as children sense
the differences between the views of the mainstream U.S. society and those of
their parents. These children have to deal with the incongruity between their
parents' values and the values held by their American peers and society in general.
Children see that their parents are different and sometimes reject those differences.
Although this is not an uncommon occurrence in immigrant families in
general, there are some unique aspects worthy of examination specific to the
various Asian American ethnic groups.


To understand the dynamics of parent-child relationships in Asian American
families, it is necessary to examine parental values and expectations as well as
their child-rearing attitudes and behaviors. Research findings suggest that, in general,
Asian American parents hold on to certain attitudes and child-rearing practices
unique to their Asian cultures. Chiu (1987) found that Chinese American
mothers are similar to Chinese mothers in expecting that children should deify
the parents, that parents are to approve (or disapprove) their children's activities,
and that it is not only acceptable but desirable for parents to actively intrude in
their children's lives. Similarly, it also was found that immigrant Chinese parents
reported that they put more emphasis on parental control and children's achievement
than was reported by White parents (Lin &amp; Fu, 1990) and that immigrant
Chinese parents scored higher than Caucasian parents on physical punishment
and yelling at children (Kelley &amp; Tseng, 1992).

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Japanese American parents also have expectations in line with their traditional
Japanese culture. They expect their children to have self-control, to be
humble, and to avoid being "different" (Gehrie, 1976). Gray and Cosgrove (1985)
found that Japanese American parents do not show overt emotion and affection
and provide relatively little praise to their children. Japanese American parents
were further found by O'Reilly, Tokuno, and Ebata (1986) to rank "behaves well"
as the most important attribute in evaluating children's social competence. White
parents, by contrast, ranked "self-directed" as the most important.


Some aspects of traditional Asian cultures can be particularly problematic
for young people who wish to appear as "American" as possible. In an ongoing
project on Asian American college students' personal histories, Lee found that
many students described feelings of shame and denial of their heritage during
their childhood.


Although I'm not really sure when I began really hating everything that was
Korean...I wouldn't let my mom bring out Korean food when my friends were
in the house. If they saw something in the refrigerator and asked what it was, I
would say, "gross stuff, I don't know," and slam it shut. I would yell at my mother
if she spoke Korean to me in front of my friends. "We're in America now, speak
American!" (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-2-14)


I refused to go to Filipino parties, eat Filipino food, and use the Filipino
language. When my parents would talk to me in Tagalog, I would admonish
them and tell them, "We're in America, speak English." And when they did talk
in English, I would make fun of their accents....I thought Asian girls were ugly
and unexciting. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-3-14)


Many Asian American families are very protective of their children (Gray &amp;
Cosgrove, 1985). As one Vietnamese American student reported in the personal
history project,
<blockquote>
<p>
I was instructed by my mother not to mention my Vietnamese heritage, so I lied
and always said my father was Thai. Although we left Vietnam long before the
Vietnam war, she worried that my classmates would shun me because memories
of America's involvement were still fresh. When my father speaks about Vietnam,
it is like a bad secret. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 93-1-3)
</p>
</blockquote>

it is like a bad secret. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 93-1-3)


Gray and Cosgrove (1985) also reported that Vietnamese parents use physical
punishment, call children nicknames (some based on physical characteristics such
as "fat" or "big head"), and use folk remedies to cure sickness. These practices
might be common among less educated parents in Vietnam, and many refugee
parents seem to carry them over to the United States. Such practices often engender
negative feelings in children and youths as they strive to be "Americans."


Some traditional Asian expectations for youth and early adulthood contrast
markedly with those of the American culture. Many Asian Indian parents maintain
the tradition of arranged marriages for their children; therefore, they do not
approve of dating and strongly forbid premarital sex (Saran, 1985; Segal, 1991;

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

To some extent, acculturation effects would be expected to modify the views
and practices of Asian American parents. There is some evidence to this effect
(Uba, 1992; Yao, 1985a, 1985b). Although Chinese American mothers scored
higher than White American mothers on authoritarian-control dimensions, they
did score lower than Chinese mothers from Taiwan (Chiu, 1987). Similarly, Korean
American parents reported that they encourage children to think independently
and allow children to have different opinions (Strom, Daniels, &amp; Park, 1986),
indicating that parental expectations for their children no longer are very traditional.
Compared to self-reports by second-generation Chinese American adolescents,
first-generation adolescents reported their families as being more
controlling. On the other hand, Vietnamese parents are reported to overwhelmingly
endorse traditional family values regardless of their length of stay in the
United States (Nguyen &amp; Williams, 1989), although they do favor some independence
and autonomy in adolescent children. Likewise, Hmong parents are
perceived by their adolescent children as having maintained strong traditional
family values (Rick &amp; Forward, 1992). Acculturation effects evidently proceed
at different rates within the various ethnic Asian American groups (Cooper, Baker,
Polichar, &amp; Welsh, 1993).


The experience of growing up in an Asian American household where parents
still hold some traditional Asian cultural values is likely to have an impact on
children's value formation. Research findings suggest that traditional Asian values
are transmitted from parents to children in these families, although many children
are discriminating in what they accept or reject.


Feldman and Rosenthal (1990) examined age expectations for behavioral autonomy
(e.g., staying out late, choosing friends, making decisions) in adolescents. They
found that both first- and second-generation Chinese adolescents reported later
age expectations than did White Americans on behavioral autonomy scales. It
appears that acculturation in age expectations for behavioral autonomy occurs
slowly among Chinese American youths, even among second-generation youths.
This finding is consistent with the earlier findings by Chiu (1987) that Chinese
American parents score higher on the authoritarian-control dimensions than do
their White American counterparts. Furthermore, Chinese American adolescents'
self-image in sexual attitudes and behavior is more conservative than that of White
American adolescents (Chen &amp; Yang, 1986). These characteristics are consistent
with Asian traditional values. Connor's (1974,1976) research suggests that Japanese

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Cultural transmission within the family also occurs in other aspects of attitudes
and values. For example, Asian American children's and youths' attitudes toward
mental health seem to be influenced by Asian cultures. Sue, Wagner, Ja, Margullis,
and Lew (1976) found that many Asian American college students believe that
(a) avoidance of morbid thoughts enhances mental health, (b) too much sex can
cause health-related problems, (c) mentally healthy persons do not become overly
angry at minor insults, and (d) mental illness is a disease of organic origin that
is more physiological than psychological in nature. Other researchers have found
that Asian American college students tend to downplay interpersonal/emotional
problems because there is a stigma attached to having these problems (Tracey,
Leong, &amp; Glidden, 1986) and that they are more willing to discuss academic or
career-related problems than problems related to relationships (Gim, Atkinson,
&amp; Whiteley, 1990). Also, Suan and Tyler (1990) found that Japanese American
college students perceive negative personal traits (e.g., untrustworthiness) as indicators
of poor mental health and view good interpersonal relations as relevant
to good mental health.


Asian cultural beliefs and values passed on by parents also seem to influence
Asian American children's help-seeking behavior. Sue and Sue (1985) reported that
Asian American parents tend to promote emotional self-reliance and restraint and
to view the seeking of outside help as being weak and dependent. Many Asian
American college students report that they turn to family members (e.g., parents,
siblings) for help (Atkinson, Whitely, &amp; Gim, 1990) or turn to "self-reliance"
(Suan &amp; Tyler, 1990) rather than to professional psychologists, indicating that
they might feel uncomfortable seeking help from persons outside their families.


<b><i>Parental Attitudes About Schooling</i></b>


Apart from home, school has perhaps the greatest impact on children's lives.
Parental and teacher attitudes about schooling greatly affect the nature of the
school experience. There is a great deal of information regarding the perceptions
of Asian American parents about their children's education. Asian American parents
have high academic expectations for their children, and children are well
aware of these expectations (Campbell &amp; Mandel, 1990; Chen &amp; Stevenson,
1995; Hieshima &amp; Schneider, 1994; Mordkowitz &amp; Ginsburg, 1987; Reglin &amp;
Adams, 1990; Schneider &amp; Lee, 1990; Whang Sc Hancock, 1994; Yao, 1985b).
Asian American parents express a commitment to education and to showing respect
for teachers (Mordkowitz &amp; Ginsburg, 1987). Furthermore, Asian American
parents structure learning activities and the home environment (Schneider

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Despite strong concerns for academic achievement and school success across
Asian American ethnic groups, there are some variations in parental and cultural
beliefs. The traditional Khmer culture, for example, holds that ability in children
is intrinsic and, therefore, that parents are less inclined to push their children to
succeed (Smith-Hefner, 1990).


<b><i>Peer Relationships</i></b>


Peer relationships have been found to have a great impact on adolescent and
young adult adjustment (Parker &amp; Asher, 1987). There is evidence to suggest
that children who are accepted by peers tend to grow up to be socially well-adjusted
adults, whereas children who are rejected by peers tend to demonstrate adjustment
problems later in life (e.g., dropping out of school, juvenile and adult criminality,
adult psychopathology). For Asian American children, peer relationships
may be more complex. Many U.S.-born Asian American students tend to socialize
with White students and seldom feel isolated. They tend to have close friends of
other races (Wang, Sedlacek, &amp; Westbrook, 1992). However, language differences
might prevent immigrant and refugee students from facilitating interactions
with nonethnic peers. Many of these children also lack the time that is needed
to form friendships because they often are relied on to care for their younger
siblings (Cicirelli, 1994; Lee &amp; Eng, 1989). Furthermore, being non-White, Asian
American students might encounter some negative responses from peers that are
related to their physical appearance. There is some evidence that this is the case.
Asian Indian and Filipino students, for example, were reported to be teased for
their darker skin (Dasgupta, 1989; Santos, 1983; Yao, 1989). Of course, how
other students react to Asian American students can be influenced by many factors
such as the racial composition of the school and neighborhood in which they live
and how teachers portray and treat Asian American students.


As a consequence of this social context, a pecking order often is established
in young people's minds. When they find someone who embodies those stereotypes
even more visibly, they disassociate themselves from that person, which can
happen through teasing, harassment, or avoidance. One Asian American student
recounted,
<blockquote>
<p>
I distinctly remember in junior high school there was a Chinese immigrant
student who did very well in math and sciences but very poorly in English and
French. His hair was never combed, he wore coke bottle glasses, and his English
was terrible.... My French teacher was very antagonistic toward him.... I
</p><p>[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br /></p><br />
wonder now if it was because she expected more from him because he was Asian.
She never seemed to take into account that it might be more difficult for recent
immigrants to do well in certain subjects. He needed extra help, and no one
offered it.... I empathized with his difficulties, although I never did anything
about it for fear that people would think I was his friend or that I was anything
like him. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-3-11)
</blockquote>

Rejection by peers might be less acute in ethnic enclaves such as New York
City's Chinatown, where Chinese immigrant children have a large group of ethnic
peers to interact with and from whom they can receive social support (Huang,
Leong, &amp; Wagner, 1994; Lee &amp; Eng, 1989; Sung, 1985). In fact, immigrant
Chinese children reported that they interact mainly with children who speak
their native dialect (Lee &amp; Eng, 1989). In these situations, of course, there is the
concern about the lack of preparation of children for participation in the broader,
multiethnic society within which Chinatown is embedded.


<b><i>Social and Economic Milieus</i></b>


The social and economic experiences of Asian American children and youths
are tremendously varied. Some Asian American children come from highly educated
and economically advantaged homes and have parents who might be many
generations distant from an immigrant experience. As described earlier, some
seldom interact with non-Asians or with other Asian groups. Others, such as
residents of Hawaii, are accustomed to great ethnic diversity. Some immigrants
have moved from a privileged life in their homeland to a privileged life as an
Asian American. By contrast, some Southeast Asian children and youths and their
parents might have experienced the stressful life associated with war in their
home countries. Some might have a strong cultural identity. Others, such as Amerasian
adolescents, might lack a strong sense of identity. The Amerasian youths
comprise a unique group due to their particular circumstances and experiences.
They grew up in Vietnam as a stigmatized group and had very little formal education.
In recent years, many Amerasian youths came to the United States under
the Amerasian Homecoming Act, which took effect in March 1989 (Mydans,
1991a). Many of these youths are experiencing serious problems that are related
to their adjustment to life in U.S. society.


In summary, the experiences of many Asian American children have been
characterized as potentially traumatic due to discrepancies between the traditional
cultural values of their parents' homeland and those held by mainstream
America. One area of difficulty is the difference in the extent to which parents
might expect to dominate and direct their children's behavior and actions. Furthermore,
Asian American families expect superior performance from their children
in school and might have a greater commitment to showing respect for
teachers than do many other American parents. The problems of language differences
and physical appearance differences also plague some young Asian
Americans in their interactions with peers. Other specific factors of social and

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS OF ASIAN AMERICAN
CHILDREN AND YOUTHS</b>


What is the status of psychological and emotional well-being of Asian American
children and youths in general? This broad question encompasses several different
dimensions such as emotion, mental health, and adjustment. Clearly, how Asian
American children and youths fare psychologically is related to their family background
(e.g., native-born/immigrant/refugee status, socioeconomic status [SES],
parents' education, parental value system, neighborhood in which they live), their
relationship with their social milieu and/or society at large (e.g., interaction with
peers, treatment at school by teacher and schoolmates), and their own individual
temperament and personality. For example, socialization practices within the families
will vary according to the degree of the parents' acculturation, which in turn
affects the children's ability to accept or respond to parental demands. In addition,
psychological adjustment for an immigrant adolescent is very different from that
for a native-born Asian American. Furthermore, even within the immigrant population,
the age of migration will engender different experiences. All these experiential
factors contribute to variations in Asian American children's and youths'
psychological and emotional state. This section discusses the following topics:
the impact of parents' attitudes on children's well-being, self-concept/self-esteem,
and psychological adjustment.


<b><i>Impact of Parents' Attitudes
on Children's Well-Being</i></b>


Asian American children and youths are aware of value differences between
their parents and themselves and sometimes evidence distress related to these
disparities. Korean American students and Americanized Hmong youths feel a
great deal of disparity in cultural values between parents and themselves (Aldwin
&amp; Greenberger, 1987; Rick &amp; Forward, 1992). This is also the case for Asian
Indian children (Gonzalez, 1991; Saran, 1985; Segal, 1991; Yao, 1989). These
conflicts pose serious psychological challenges for children as they strive to deal
with the two worlds in which they live: the American world outside the home
and the world of their non-Americanized families. Aldwin and Greenberger (1987)
found that for Korean American students, the extent to which they perceive parents
as having traditional values is related to the severity of these students' depression.

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Parental commitment to cultural and ethnic traditions has a significant impact
on children's adjustment (Phinney &amp; Chavira, 1992; Phinney, Lochner, &amp;
Murphy, 1990). Some Asian American parents create difficult circumstances for
their children's adjustment because they themselves have ambivalent attitudes.
They seem at once to have some Americanized ideas and beliefs while still holding
on to certain traditional values. The mixed feelings and attitudes are reflected in
their expectations for their children. Dasgupta (1989) reported that Asian Indian
immigrant parents, for example, have two standards in socializing their children.
On the one hand, parents encourage their children to be independent and assertive
in dealing with U.S. society; on the other hand, children are expected to be obedient,
dependent, and deferent to their parents at home. Vietnamese parents express
a similar ambivalence toward their adolescent children. They strongly endorse
Asian traditional values, but they also approve autonomy and independence in their
adolescents (Nguyen &amp; Peterson, 1993; Nguyen &amp; Williams, 1989). This type
of ambivalent attitude makes it very difficult for their children to behave in "appropriate"
ways so as to be accepted by their parents. For children, parental acceptance
is important. For example, Hahn (1981) found that for Korean American
children, perceived parental acceptance is positively related to children's self-esteem
and school achievement.


<b><i>Self-Concept/Self-Esteem</i></b>


Several studies have examined self-concepts among certain groups of Asian
American children and youths. Generation differences are reported by Rosenthal
and Feldman (1992) in that first-generation Chinese American adolescents identify
with being Chinese (58%) more than do second-generation Chinese American
adolescents (18%). Second-generation Chinese identified themselves as American
(42%) more often than did first-generation Chinese (16%).


Chen and Yang's (1986) research compared first-generation Chinese adolescents'
self-image to that of White American adolescents. It was found that Chinese
American adolescents responded in a similar way as the White sample and very
differently from Chinese adolescents in China. Lee and Eng (1989) not only found
generation differences among Chinese American children and adolescents who
lived in and around New York's Chinatown but also found that length of stay in
the United States and age of migration were related to mean scores on the Harter
Self-Perception Scale. Those who were native born and who migrated at an early
age and had been in the United States for more than 3 years had self-concept
scores similar to those of Harter's normative sample. By contrast, recent immigrants
had lower self-concept scores and different patterns of response on the
various subscales from those of the normative sample. Similarly, Japanese American
children, most of whom are third-and fourth-generation Americans, reported
very similar self-concept scores as White American children (Pang, Mizokawa,
Morishima, &amp; Olstad, 1985). There might be greater within-group differences
on self-concept scores than differences between different ethnic groups. For example,

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In one area in particular, Asian American children and youths have different
self-esteem ratings from those of other Americans of comparable ages. Asian American
young people are more likely to have lower scores on physical self-esteem
measures. Using the modified Piers-Harris Children Self-Concept Scale, Pang et
al. (1985) found that Japanese American children scored lower on the physical
self-concept subscale, and Chang (1975) found that Korean American children
scored lower than Black children on the same subscale. Lee and Eng (1989) also
found that native-born Chinese American children scored lower on the physical
self-concept subscale on the Harter Self-Perception Scale. Similarly, Japanese American
female college students reported more dissatisfaction with their physical appearance
than did White Americans or Japanese male students (Arkoff &amp; Weaver,
1966). Asamen and Berry (1987), in their study of alienation and self-concept,
found that physical self-concepts were negatively related to perceived prejudice
among Japanese American college students.


It appears that some Asian American children and youths are not very happy
about their physical appearance. This is not surprising given U.S. society's Eurocentric
view of physical attractiveness. Skin color is clearly a salient characteristic
that Asian American students use to judge attractiveness, and they show greater
sensitivity to it than do either White or Asian/White mixed students (Grove, 1991).


For minority children, ethnic identity development is intertwined with general
identity development. Therefore, their attitudes toward their physical appearance
might have significant effects on their identity development. Phinney's
(1989) research found that more Asian American adolescents than either Black
or Hispanic American adolescents reported that they would prefer belonging to
a White group if they had a choice, indicating a somewhat negative attitude toward
their ethnic identity. This negative attitude can be influenced by certain
Asian cultural values that affect ethnic identity such as the socialization of shame.
Yeh and Huang (1996) found that Asian American college students' sense of ethnic
identity was influenced by an avoidance of shame.


Similarly, in the College Student Personal History Project, Lee found that
many Asian American college students report that they grew up feeling that they
were uglier or less socially accepted than other students because they did not
measure up to the White standards held by their peers, teachers, and popular
media. As one student recounted,
<blockquote>
<p>
I went through junior high school wishing that I was not Chinese but rather a
blue-eyed blond ... petite American girl that all the boys liked. I didn't like my
mushroom-shaped head of thick hair and my slanted eyes for which I was
mistaken for a boy more than once. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 95-1-5)

It is possible that Asian American children's lower scores on physical self-concept
measures reflect a response tendency toward modesty and undervaluation.
Schwartz (1971) found a negative relationship between self-esteem and

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because there has been relatively little empirical research on direct examination
of Asian American children's and youths' self-concept/self-esteem, it is
worthwhile to include studies that have examined correlates to Asian American
children and youths' self-concept/self-esteem or identity. The relationship between
children's self-concept and other areas might shed some light on our understanding.
Asamen and Berry (1987) found that for both Chinese and Japanese
American college students, low self-concept is negatively related to high alienation.
Hahn (1981) found that there is a positive relationship among perceived
parental acceptance, children's self-esteem, and school achievement. Children's
reported self-esteem also was found to be related to family SES in that higher
family SES is related to children's higher self-esteem. Kim (1983) found that for
Korean immigrant children in New York City, there is a positive relationship
among levels of self-concept, English proficiency, and school adaptation and
achievements. Ting-Toomey (1981) found that for Chinese American youths, ethnic
identity was not predictive of a close friendship network, indicating that these
students do not choose their close friends based on ethnicity. Similarly, Rosenthal
and Feldman (1992) suggested that length of stay in the United States (first generation
vs. second generation) is not associated with Chinese American adolescents' friendship
networks. Lee (ongoing project) reported that Asian American college students
indicate a differential ethnic link between close and "regular" friends. They generally
characterize their friendship patterns as not ethnically based in that they
do seek out friends of similar ethnicity to "hang out" with, but close friendships
do not appear to be tied to ethnicity. Wang et al.'s (1992) findings concur in that
native-born college students were more likely to have close friends that were of
other races. However, there is some evidence that friendship patterns among Asian
Americans might be the product of racism. As one college student recounted,
<blockquote>

With the exception of one close Chinese American friend, I avoided making
friends with the other Asian Americans in school. I felt that by associating with

them, this would confirm other people's suspicions that I was a grade-mongering,
socially inept Asian. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-4-2)

In sum, self-concept/self-esteem among Asian American children and youths
has been found to be negatively related to alienation and positively related to
parental acceptance, SES background, English proficiency (for immigrant children),
school adjustment and achievement, and perceived social acceptance for
Vietnamese children. Although no causal links can be established between self-concept/self-esteem
and various factors in the social milieu, the research findings
suggest that much can be done in these other areas to enhance Asian American
children's self-concept/self-esteem.


<b><i>Psychological Adjustment</i></b>


One approach to assessing Asian American children's and youths' state of
psychological adjustment is to examine how these children and youths fare in
their daily lives. Indicators of adjustment/maladjustment can be seen through self-reports
of perceived levels of stress, the individual's perceived ability to deal with
these everyday stresses, and self-reports or clinical observations of depression.


Kinzie, Ryals, Cottington, and McDermott (1973) examined depressive symptoms
among different ethnic groups of college students in Hawaii. They found
that Chinese and Japanese American students in the sample reported higher levels
of depression than did White students. Similarly, Aldwin and Greenberger (1987)
found that Korean American college students reported more symptoms of depression
and felt more pressured than did White American students. In addition,
there appears to be a gender difference in that Asian American females were more
likely to be in the more severely depressed category. Factors that appear to be
related to depression in these studies were an unhappy family life, being away
from home, and perceived conflict with parents' traditional values. Fraier and
Schauben (1994) also found that Asian American female college students reported
a greater number of psychological symptoms and higher levels of stress compared
to European American students. The most frequent stressors were test pressures,
financial problems, and relationship breakups. Chang (1996), Greenberger and
Chen (1996), and Okazaki (1997) also found higher rates of depression in Asian
American college students than in White American students.


Research findings show that children and youths in Hawaii might face specific
challenges that are different from those faced in the U.S. mainland. Hawaii, being
a multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural context with unique characteristics,
might have psychological impacts on Asian American children and youths that
are not apparent. Stephan and Stephan (1989) found that Asian American college
students in Hawaii reported more anxiety when interacting with Whites and had
more negative attitudes toward Whites than did Hispanic Americans on the mainland.
It appeared that contacts with Whites were associated with anxiety and
stress. This might be a residual effect of Hawaii's "colonial" history. In addition,
Waldron and Whittington (1985) found that many unique problems facing children

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is evidence that immigrant children and youths suffer higher levels of
stress than do native-born children and youths. Abe and Zane's (1990) research
suggests that foreign-born Asian American college students reported greater psychological
maladjustment than did White and U.S.-born Asian American students.
This finding held true after controlling for many confounding variables, indicating
that foreign-born Asian American youths are at greater risk for psychological
maladjustment. Padilla, Wagatsuma, and Lindholm (1985) also found that Japanese
American immigrant college students reported greater stress levels than did
native-born students. Asian Indian immigrant college students also were found
to suffer from a number of depressive symptoms such as moodiness, anxiety,
loneliness, and paranoid feelings (Pais, 1990). These symptoms appear to be related
to their social interactions with White students; many reported having misunderstandings
in relationships with White friends and peers. It appears that
acculturation played an important role; less acculturation was related to higher
stress levels, whereas high acculturation was related to lower stress levels.


Asian American children and youths emigrating from Southeast Asia experience
not only stress related to present life events but also stress related to the
traumas associated with war in their home countries. In general, the early group
of Vietnamese children who came right after the fall of Vietnam (approximately
1974-1975) have fared quite well in the United States. These children and youths
appear to be adjusting well. Their parents (including foster parents) have reported
very few social, psychological, and/or school problems (Sokolof f, Carlin, &amp; Pham,
1984). However, these children generally came to the United States at an early
age and were from well-to-do (educationally and economically) families. On the
other hand, children who came to the United States during the second wave
(1979 to the early and mid-1980s) as refugees have not fared as well. Most of
the second-wave Vietnamese were from lower SES backgrounds and had parents
who were less educated or illiterate. Charron and Ness (1981) studied these second-wave
refugee children and youths using a self-report questionnaire. They
found a high degree of distress among these adolescents. Female Vietnamese adolescents
had a higher rate of distress and also reported more intense distress than
did male adolescents. High emotional distress was found to be related to having
few American friends, conflicts with parents, low English proficiency, and fewer
years in U.S. schools.


It appears that refugee status has a negative impact on children's and youths'
psychological adjustment. Kinzie, Sack, Angell, Manson, and Rath (1986) found
that many Cambodian adolescents were diagnosed as having "depressive disorder"
and were rated by teachers as withdrawn (Sack, Angell, Kinzie, &amp; Rath,
1986). Many of these Cambodian youths who were traumatized in their earlier
lives showed posttraumatic stress disorder over a long period of time, indicating
the enduring nature of these traumatic experiences (Abe, Zane, &amp; Chun, 1994;

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Within this group of Southeast Asian refugee children and adolescents, the
Amerasian youths mentioned earlier comprise a unique group because of their
particular circumstances and experiences. How are these children and adolescents
adjusting in U.S. society? Most came thinking that they had finally, after many
years of longing, come to their fathers' land where they would belong and where
life would be different. However, many have been disappointed. Mydans (1991a)
reported that many of these children and adolescents have language problems
and feel rejected by the Vietnamese community in the United States. Many have
the sense that they do not really belong anywhere. Mothers of these Amerasian
children and adolescents rated their children very high on somatization, depression,
withdrawal, and symptoms of psychosis as compared to White mothers' ratings
of their children (Nicassio, LaBarbera, Coburn, &amp; Finley, 1986). Male children and
adolescents in particular were rated high on these dimensions. Carlin (cited in
Mydans, 1991a) also reported high levels of depression among Amerasian children.
These findings suggest that there might be significant psychological distress
among Amerasian children and youths. However, the problems of Amerasian
children and youths need to be compared with those of other Vietnamese children
and youths to identify the problems that are unique to Amerasians.


In sum, Asian American college students reported more symptoms of depression
than did White American students. The general interpretation is that Asian
Americans suffer from more stress related to their minority status. Several sources
of psychological stress have been identified. Sue and Chin (1983) pointed out
that different cultural values in socialization, racism in the United States, and
changes in life (which are more relevant to immigrants and refugees) tend to
negatively affect the mental health of Chinese American children and youths.
Demands for excellence from families and social isolation also were found to
have a negative impact on Asian American children's and youths' psychological
health (Bourne, 1975). Other common sources of stress that were identified in
previous studies are degrees of acculturation, socialization/cultural factors, and
parental value orientations. In general, less acculturated Asian American college
students reported more stress than did those who were more acculturated. Perceiving
parents as having traditional views is related to increased depression,
whereas perceiving parents as having modern views is related to decreased depression.
Socialization practices that are influenced by Asian cultures also might
have a bearing on Asian American children's and youths' psychological health.

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Studies on Southeast Asian refugee children and youths suggest that refugee
children and youths appear to have higher stress levels and show more depressive
symptoms than do normative samples. In general, the earlier arrivals adjusted
well, both in natural homes and in adoptive or foster homes. The younger the
age on migration to the United States, the better the adjustment. However, the
later arrivals and Amerasian adolescents have had problems of adjustment. Vietnamese
high school students' emotional stress is related to their interpersonal
relationships with White peers at school, their relationships with parents, and
their English proficiency. The clinical diagnosis of depression in Southeast Asian
youths is related to their living situations. Those who live at home or live in
ethnic foster homes are less likely to be diagnosed as depressive than are those
who live in Caucasian foster homes. As discussed earlier, parents of Cambodian
youths showed higher symptoms of stress than did a normal sample, which might
suggest that these children live in a stressful immediate environment. These daily
stresses combined with their early traumatic experiences, which appear to be
expressed in the form of posttraumatic symptoms, leave Cambodian youths at
high risk for maladjustment.


<b>SOCIETY'S VIEW OF ASIAN AMERICAN
CHILDREN AND YOUTHS</b>


The ways in which Asian American children and youths are viewed within the
mainstream society of the United States may both enhance and limit the possibilities
for personal fulfillment and societal contributions of this population. Therefore,
it is important to examine not only what is really the case but also what is
believed to be the case. Such views include perceptions of Asian Americans as
the "model minority" that possesses superior academic abilities, especially in mathematics
and science, and as the economically self-sufficient and culturally superior
minority group that is not in need of special support to become independent and
successful in U.S. society. In contrast to this model minority image are increasing
concerns over the recent growth of Asian youth gangs in the United States. This
section discusses these issues under the following topics: the concept of Asian
Americans as a model minority—its origin, development, and impact on Asian
Americans—and Asian gang and criminal activities.


<b><i>Model Minority</i></b>


It is important to understand the image of the model minority within a historical
context. Contrary to today's image, Asians who came to the United States
in the mid-1800s to early 1900s were considered a backward people who were
so culturally and morally deviant that they were unassimilable to American ways
of life. Although different nationalities of Asians came to and stayed in the United
States for different reasons, they encountered racism that tended to homogenize
their identities. Throughout this period of history, Asians who migrated to the

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The most prominent of the model minority stereotypes applied to Asian Americans
by the U.S. media is that of the "bootstraps" family that has managed to
scrimp and save to build a better life for the next generation. Politically, this
idealized picture of Asian families has been used to criticize everything from the
woes of other minorities and their dependence on big government to the consequences
of our country's departure from traditional family roles.


The model minority image often depicts Asian parents as placing a high value
on education, self-improvement, family honor, and (most important) hard work.
Asian children respond by being obedient, filial, uncomplaining hard workers
and overachievers. When Asian families face a crisis or when there are difficulties
within Asian families, they tend to deal with those issues at home rather than air
their "dirty laundry" or seek the aid of public agencies. Even those immigrants
"fresh off the boat," who came from war-torn countries, are said to have been
able to overcome their enormous psychological trauma and prosper economically
on their own.


The model Asian and Asian American student is integral to the image of the
model Asian family (Kim, 1973; Kitano &amp; Sue, 1973; Lee &amp; Rong, 1988;
Minatoya &amp; Sedlacek, 1981). Lee and Rong (1988), in reviewing the educational
and economic achievements of Asian Americans, state,
<blockquote>
<p>
The superior performance of Asian American students from kindergarten
through graduate school is so well known that it hardly needs recounting. Asian
children, only a few years off the boat, have won national spelling bees. They
have taken a major share of Westinghouse Science Awards, are disproportionately
represented in the student bodies of prestigious colleges and universities,
and sometimes outnumber all the other students in mathematics and science
classes. In 30 years, four Asian Americans have won the Nobel prize in physics,
and another has won the prize in chemistry, (p. 546)

and sometimes outnumber all the other students in mathematics and science

and another has won the prize in chemistry, (p. 546)


This popular conception of the academically successful Asian American is
supported by much research. Asian American students, in general, have demonstrated
outstanding academic achievement (Sue &amp; Okazaki, 1990). Even immigrant
and refugee (especially Vietnamese) students in public schools are doing very
well in academic work (Caplan et al., 1992; Caplan, Whitmore, &amp; Choy, 1989;
Hirayama, 1985; Rumbaut &amp; Ima, 1988; Sung, 1987). Researchers also have
reported that Asian American students spend more time studying than do non-Asian
American students (Reglin &amp; Adams, 1990; Tsang, 1984), indicating that
extrinsic efforts rather than genetic factors might account for their school achievement.
There are, however, variations within Asian American groups in regard to
academic success. For example, Khmer and Laotian students lag behind. As cited
earlier, within the traditional Khmer culture, academic effort is not stressed because
there is the belief that success, or lack thereof, is due to intrinsic abilities
rather than effort (Smith-Hefner, 1990).

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Most researchers explain Asian American students' outstanding academic
achievement from a cultural perspective that concentrates on family socialization
factors such as parental expectations. However, the relationship is not so simple.
Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, and Fraleigh (1987) investigated the relationships
between parenting styles and adolescents' school performance with
a diverse high school population in the San Francisco Bay area. Using Baumrind's
topology (authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative) to assess parenting style,
Dornbusch et al. found that, in general, students' grades were negatively related
to authoritarian parenting styles and positively related to authoritative parenting
styles regardless of ethnicity. Interestingly enough, even though the Asian American
sample reported a higher mean on authoritarian parenting style and a lower
mean on authoritative style as compared to those of White families, on the whole,
the group demonstrated higher grades, indicating that the success of Asian American
students cannot be adequately explained by parenting styles alone. Steinberg,
Dornbusch, and Brown (1992) further reported that peer support for academic
achievement offsets the negative consequences of the authoritarian parenting
style among Asian American high school students.


There is the widespread belief that Asian Americans are model students who
are respectful to teachers and diligent but not necessarily vocally assertive and
who consistently excel in mathematics and science but are less able in other areas
(Allis, 1991 ; Bagasao, 1989). For example, teachers view Asian American students
as not competent at expressing feelings, persuasiveness, assertiveness, and leadership
skills (Bannai &amp; Cohen, 1985) and as more passive, quieter, and less capable
at social tasks than White students (Kim, Y J., 1983; Sung, 1987). These beliefs
often influence the ways in which teachers and counselors relate to Asian American
students. Schneider and Lee (1990) compared the social and academic skills
of Asian American 6th and 7th graders to those of White students of similar
socioeconomic background and found that teachers' actions were related to their
perceptions of Asian American students as quiet students. Teachers tended to call
on Asian Americans less often than on Anglo students. As one teacher described
an Asian student in her class: "She is quiet, she tends to do her tasks, and ... she
is also self-disciplined. But she is a little more outgoing than other Oriental children.
She asks questions." This attitude is supported by Feng and Cartledge's
(1996) findings that teachers tended to attribute Asian American students' behaviors
to internal characteristics.


What impact do these images have on Asian American children and youths?
Some college students reported that they felt pigeonholed.


This stereotype controlled my life. I came home from school and studied.
Weekends I studied. And why? Because White society created an image of me
that I needed to keep up or else suffer the consequences of being rejected from
society. I would be talked about if I did not score an A on exams. I was unhappy
because I could not live my life at a time when I should have had no worries.
My high school years were spent in a room surrounded by four walls, a bed, a
desk, and a bookshelf. If this is what being a model minority entails, I would
rather pass. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 97-4-30)

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Some students described situations in which they turned to teachers or counselors
for help but found them insensitive or ignorant.


[My adviser] just kept recommending that I take more advanced physics and
math classes. Academically, I was stereotyped as the typical Asian "geek," even
though my grades in history and social studies were always above average. I
think the teachers assumed that I would like math and science more because I
was Chinese and did so well in these classes. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-1-8)


When my friend, who was second generation, moved to Dallas, when she was
registering in school—the counselor there was ready to make her take an English
exam and was considering placing her in a remedial course because she assumed
that she knew little English. (Case 96-3-15)


As can be seen, the confluence of parental expectations and societal expectations
for academic prowess might, in some instances, inappropriately channel
the life course of some Asian American youngsters and might inhibit the development
of other types of abilities. Tan (1994) reported that many Asian American
college students believed that the model minority stereotype was more of a hindrance
than encouragement to their productivity. Apprehensiveness about evaluation
(Sue, Ino, &amp; Sue, 1983) might prove dysfunctional in some Asian American
students. Two college students reported the following:
<blockquote>
<p>
My mother's friend's daughter committed suicide by jumping out of the county
library window because she felt that she couldn't graduate from Columbia with
honors. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-2-5)
</p>
<p>
My brother at this time was rebelling against everything. It hurt me to see how
bad he was treating my parents. He was a victim of all the whiz kid media
portrayal of Asian kids because he was not one of them. He excelled in the arts
and resented the fact that teachers thought he should go into math and science.
(Lee, ongoing project, Case 95-3-7)

(Lee, ongoing project, Case 95-3-7)


Similarly, Kubany, Gallimore, and Buell (1970) reported that Filipino American
children were found to show more competitiveness in public than in private
situations, indicating an extrinsically based motivation to be seen as capable.


Clearly, the societal expectation for academic success, and especially as narrowly
focused on in the areas of mathematics and science, might be less than a
good fit for some Asian American children and youths (Hsia, 1987). Such stereotypes
ignore individual differences. When Asian American children do not fit
this model, they might experience the intense pressure to fit in with these expectations
as a source of stress (Lee, 1994, 1996).


One other consequence of the model minority image is the notion that resources
of social service agencies and governmental bodies are less necessary for
Asian American groups than for other minorities within the U.S. society (Federal
Civil Rights Commission, 1992). There is, however, some evidence that these

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

only went to see the counselor once because ... right off the bat, he attributed
all my problems to my relationship with my family. He said they put too much
pressure on me to succeed, even though in reality they hardly put any pressure
on me at all. (Lee, ongoing project, Case 92-3-8)


<b><i>Criminal and Gang Activities</i></b>


The generally favorable picture of Asian American children and youths in
the United States has been countered by arrest statistics published by the U.S.
Department of Justice (1988, 1992, 1996). The number of Asian American and
Pacific Islander youths (under 18 years of age) arrested increased steadily from
1987 to 1995, whereas arrests of those age 18 years or older were stable in the
population at large. The types of offenses that contributed to this increase were
crimes against families and children, curfew violations, embezzlement, gambling,
robbery, runaways, and sex offenses. The runaway problem among Chinese immigrant
youths in San Francisco also has been reported to be related in some way
to an increase in gang membership (Louie, Joe, Lu, &amp; Tong, 1991). These runaways
usually end up in some gang group house and are at risk of getting involved
in criminal activities.

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086812-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Within the past few years, national attention has focused on the reported
increase of Asian youth gang activities (Dao, 1992). Membership of these youth
gangs appears to be clustered by ethnicity. Chinese youth gang activities in and
around Chinatown in New York City (Lubasch, 1991; Sung, 1987) have been
reported to be on the rise. Vietnamese gang activities were reported to be increasing
and reported to be more dangerous because the members grew up in
chaotic Vietnam and witnessed many atrocities. These members were described
by the New York police as wild and uncontrollable (Hays, 1990; Lorch, 1990).
Vietnamese gang activities also were reported to cause gang terror in some areas
of California (Gross, 1991; Mydans, 1991b). These "problem youths" were described
as being disappointed with life in the United States, experiencing difficulties
in school in both academic and social areas (Peters, 1988), experiencing
conflicts in the home (Furuto &amp; Murase, 1992), and believing that they will be
protected by joining gang groups (Hays, 1990; Lorch, 1990).


In a recent ethnographic study of Vietnamese youth gangs in Orange County,
California, Vigil, Yun, and Long (1992) reported that poverty and an intense
desire to obtain money played a major role in convincing adolescents to join
gangs. As one youth revealed to the researchers,
<blockquote>
<p>
I didn't want my parents' money. I wanted my own money.... I feel like maybe
they need the money. I always tried to get my own money ... so I got the job
[as a hotel bellboy] to save money. But the money was too slow. I didn't have
enough money. I wanted more money. So I quit.... With my homeboys [gang
members], I could make $10,000 a day. (p. 45)
</p>
</blockquote>


I didn't want my parents' money. I wanted my own money.... I feel like maybe
they need the money. I always tried to get my own money ... so I got the job
[as a hotel bellboy] to save money. But the money was too slow. I didn't have
enough money. I wanted more money. So I quit.... With my homeboys [gang
members], I could make $10,000 a day. (p. 45)


According to Vigil et al. (1992), gang activities usually involve property crimes,
car thefts, and "home invasion robberies." The most lucrative of these activities
are the home invasion robberies, in which an evening's take ranges from $20,000
to $100,000. These robberies are well organized and planned. Gangs receive
information about families who keep their savings in their homes, invade the
homes, and force the victims to reveal their hiding places. Much of the information
comes from family members or relatives who are gang members. These home
invasions might be related to the increase in crimes against families by Asian
American and Pacific Islander youths under 18 years of age cited earlier.


It appears, however, that problems with alcohol and drug use might not be
as prevalent with Asian American children and youths as with other groups.
Gillmore et al. (1990) observed that Asian American adolescents' use of alcohol
and drugs is much lower than that of White youths. U.S. Department of Justice
(1988, 1992, 1996) statistics also showed a decrease in arrests related to drug
abuse violations by Asian American and Pacific Islander youths under 18 years
of age. It is likely that much of this relatively low drug use is related to parental
disapproval and control.


There is a need to better understand the factors that have led to the increases
in gang and criminal activities among Asian American youths. It may well be
that a broader spectrum of options for the engagement of immigrant youths

<b>CONCLUSION</b>


This review of the state of Asian American children and youths in U.S. society is
incomplete because of the dearth of systematic research on Asian American children
and youths. Even when there are studies, they are focused mainly on Chinese
Americans, Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, and Vietnamese Americans.
Very little has been reported about other groups such as Asian Indian Americans,
Filipino Americans, and other Southeast Asian American groups. Many of the
published reports are of the nature of "impressionistic discussions" rather than
empirical studies. Although these reports are useful in highlighting the various
qualitative aspects of the lives of Asian American children and youths, they cannot
take the place of empirical research during which data are generated.


There are few baseline data that describe the diversity of family life and activities
of the various ethnic groups that comprise Asian America. Given the importance
of family in traditional Asian cultures, understanding family dynamics
(parent-child relations, sibling relations, and the role of extended family members
such as aunts, uncles, and grandparents) is central to assessing the psychological
state of Asian American children and youths. In addition, it is important to understand
the state of children and youths through their own perceptions of their
world; we need to know how they view their own existence in this society, whether
they experience stress, and what their perceptions are of the social supports within
their social milieu.


At least 10% of the growing Asian American children and youth population
are immigrants and refugees who arrived in the United States in the past 3 years.
Except for a small segment of Vietnamese refugees, little research has been undertaken
to assess the health and well-being of these children. There is a great
need for in-depth studies of the lives of children and youths of the various ethnic
groups within the Asian American community. The production of a set of descriptive
data related to the various spheres of their lives would be useful. Also,
an increasing number of White families have adopted children from Asian countries
in recent years, yet there is little knowledge or understanding of how these
children are functioning within a social milieu that is ethnically and racially different
from themselves.


The ultimate goal is to allow Asian American children to have access to the
variety of options available to other Americans (e.g., choose majors at school and
later careers) without feeling obligated or pressured to fit a certain image of Asian
Americans. We need to broaden the scope of opportunities for Asian Americans
to participate and to attempt development in areas not seen as special strengths
and thus to modify their own views of limitations and the views of others in
mainstream society.
