I think there can be no greater suffering than the state
of mind I find myself in at present. I am sane enough to
know that I am no longer sane. Somewhere, somehow, I
am being dragged over a line, a line which never even
existed for me until now. It's I, not someone else, but I,
who am crossing that line, and I see no way to stop
myself.


I have become, inexplicably, a wandering and
completely bewildered stranger in the realm of my
emotions. I can no longer find my way back to my
familiar and known world where I <i>did</i> dwell <i>once</i> in
some harmony with myself. Everyone is on the other
side of an impenetrable glass. We can see each other, but
we cannot reach each other, and I am stretching out my
hand in vain. I am alone and abandoned in the dark, and
I am terrified, beyond any understanding, and the <i>not</i>

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I can't move in any direction.


I am becoming more and more rigid physically. I
am afraid that if I turn my head, even a little, I will <i>see</i>
my horrible terrors and they will overwhelm me. I think
I'm being followed, inexorably followed--I am running
through endless, twisting, pitch-dark tunnels, and I can't
find my way out. There is no light at the end of any
turn I take. I can't turn back. I am being backed into
the darkest and last corner of all. (Oh, yes, I know it's
not rational, but I can't stop thinking these monstrous
thoughts.)


I long to escape from these feelings that I can
neither understand nor bear. Where is there a place for
me, where can I go, where can I turn, save deeper and
deeper into the labyrinth of my poor sick mind?


My mind is dying and I want to die with it.


The pain is too much to bear.


Even my body hurts.


My terrors are crushing me, smothering me. I can't
breathe--I can't communicate my fears to anyone with
any hope that they will be understood. I am locking
myself up in a prison of my own making, a horrible,
painful prison, to which I have no key.


There is only one escape, and that is death. I plan
each day and night how to take my life. It is hard to
believe that I, who loved life so much, am planning to
kill myself--find myself longing for death. I am obsessed
with one desire--to blot out a mind that can harbor and
play with such thoughts.


Someone must help me--save me from myself, for
what will become of me?

I don't really want to die.


<i>The Fissure</i>


How long had this state of mind been in the
making, and what had triggered it? I remember vividly
an episode that made me begin to doubt my sanity.


In July my husband and I took our four children
to a ranch in Wyoming. I was thrashing down my
favorite stream in my waders, slipping and sliding on the
wet rocks, with my trout rod in one hand, and two
trout with a stick threaded through their gills in the
other, humming away happily. I was thinking, "How I
Jove this country, and how I love fishing. They give me
such a sense of peace."


The wind was blowing off the mountains. On one
mountaintop there was a big patch of snow. I could
smell the pine trees and could almost feel the snow. I
felt an extraordinarily acute sense of well-being and
delight in my surroundings--one of those rare moments
in your life when everything seems right, and time
appears to stop for an instant, so that you become
aware of an infinitely precious moment. In fact, it was
all so beautiful and perfect, I wanted to cry, because
these moments come so seldom, and they are so quickly
gone.


I sat down on a log to change my fly to a brighter
one, because the sun was beginning to go down. I was
feeling quite elated. I had found a deep, dark-green, very
fishy-looking pool, where I was sure a big, fat, record-breaking
trout would be lurking. I took time out to
munch on a peanut-butter sandwich and to smoke a
cigarette.

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shut my eyes to listen to the rush of the stream
over its rocky bed and the wind from the mountains
rustling through the leaves of the aspen trees behind me.
I thought, "How much are we a part of what we see and
feel, and <i>how</i> we see it and feel it." I wanted this
moment to go on forever.


When I opened my eyes to get on with the
fly-tying job, suddenly I felt something had gone wrong.
I had a terrible sense of dread, and I was overwhelmed
by panic--all the more inexplicable because of my
feelings and thoughts just seconds before. I could not
move. I hurt all over--in my heart, my body, and my
head too. I said to myself, "What's wrong, you idiot?
Get up and take a look around." But when I did, I
thought I saw bears all around me, converging on my
bend of the stream, closing in on me (we had seen a bear
at a distance, out riding, a few days earlier). Why were
they after me? Did they want my fish? I looked around
frantically for a way to escape, and in my panic I forgot
where I had tied my horse. The terror became unbearable.
I flung my fish to the ground and plunged into the
stream and tried desperately to wade against the
current, hoping the bears could not swim. The stream
was near freezing and the current was strong. It was like
a nightmare in which you try to run and cannot. My legs
behaved as if they were made of putty. It was like being
caught in quicksand.


Where <i>was</i> my horse?


Finally I struggled up the steep bank of the stream,
running over rocks and fallen trees. I could not find the
patch of aspens where I had left my horse. My throat
was so dry I felt I was choking. My heart was beating as

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What had happened to me? I looked upward. The
sky was a cloudless blue; there was an afterglow
lingering across the valley, from the sun setting behind
the highest mountains. High up, an osprey glided. I
could see his nest on top of a tall, dead tree, far away.
There was no rain. No wind. No thunder. No lightning.


And there were no bears.


Trembling with cold from my immersion in the
stream, I put my face against my horse's side and wept.


Later, I went to retrieve my rod and rode back to
the ranch through the dusk--such a peaceful time of
day--badly shaken. My terror had passed but was
replaced with a sickening sense of dread, of something
totally unknown, unimaginable, unthinkable, and above
all, <i>not to be shared with anyone</i>.

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Just moments ago I had been so joyous in my
aloneness; now I was isolated in a different kind of
aloneless, and I was frightened beyond description. This
was a kind of lonely aloneness to be feared. I felt I
might not be able to get out of it, ever. Where might it
lead me? I would have to cling to people now, to keep
away any more of this type of thing. I who loved so
much to be alone could no longer trust myself to be
alone.


<i>The Crack Widens</i>


I think I slipped down the next step five months
later, in December, when my husband and I went to
Florida with the children. I had developed a kidney
infection on the train, so we stopped at Jacksonville,
where I was left in a hospital, while the children and my
husband went on to our original destination.


I felt completely and unreasonably abandoned.
The drug that I was given by the doctors was not
agreeing with me, and I was panicky. I was becoming
obsessed with drug reactions. I had had serious ones in
the past, where my throat swelled up and I couldn't
breathe. I was afraid that a new doctor would pooh-pooh
my past allergic reactions, and was frightened to
try the drug he had ordered for me, especially since he
would not tell me what it was. Half the time I took the
pills because I hurt so, and half the time I pretended I
had taken them and hid them in the side of my mouth,
swallowed water, and disposed of them later.


As soon as I could stand up, I took a plane, a
two-seater, to fly me to where the children were. In the
plane I was overcome by a violent feeling of claustrophobia.

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later, coming back from Florida on the train to
New York, I was lying on my bed in my compartment
with a very lovable stray cat we had adopted, or rather
that had adopted us. Suddenly he looked much too big,
and I flung him off the bed in terror. I burst into tears,
because I really loved him, and I had hurt him. I ran to
the club car to join the children, trying to feel normal.


Back in New York in April I went to seek
psychiatric help, because I knew I was losing my grip on
myself, and my marriage was in part responsible. My
only salvation was in this doctor on whom I focused all
my hopes. He <i>had</i> to make me better.


One evening in the spring, one of my children and I
were walking up Madison Avenue back to our apartment
in New York, after a happy afternoon of shopping.
Suddenly we were caught in a pelting downpour of rain.
At first we both got the giggles; we didn't have
raincoats, rainhats, or umbrellas.


My daughter did the logical and sensible thing and

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I spent all of that night in a shivering panic. I was
afraid to look at the windows. I was terrified that I was
going to be compelled to jump out of one. About four
in the morning, I moved into the bathroom, which had
no window, lay on a bath mat, and went to sleep.


Soon I could no longer go to theaters or movies. If
I went, I had to run out of them. Riding the elevator in
the apartment house or in any store was a torture. Never
did I discuss weather so assiduously with the elevator
men, to take my mind off my terror. Self-service
elevators were out of the question. I could no longer
visit people who lived in buildings that had no elevator
men in the elevators, unless they were kind enough to
come and fetch me or unless I could walk up and down
the stairs. I could no longer use the tunnel to get to
Long Island from New York City.


Gradually I arrived at the point where I could not
use subways, buses, trains, planes, boats, and finally
taxis and my own car, unless I could stop at any
moment, anywhere, and get out. I was ashamed to be

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the early summer we moved from our apartment
to a new house in the country. I remember drifting
around the apartment in a daze of drugs (I was on all
kinds of tranquilizers by this time), trying desperately
to tag things for the house, things for storage, things to
be sold with the apartment. The effort to do this
coherently was such that I could hardly breathe. My
lungs, my stomach, and my legs had a funny "all-gone"
feeling. The objects I tagged seemed to be floating in a
spaceless kind of world. I wanted to play the piano,
usually a source of much pleasure to me, but I could not
go near it, no matter how hard I tried.


I had a craving, an overpowering compulsion, to
get everything settled and unpacked all at once in this
new house, as if there were no time left, as if <i>external</i>
order in the house might produce <i>internal</i> order inside
me. Consequently I worked way beyond the limits of
my strength, late into the nights.


<i>The Rope Snaps</i>


After we had been settled and I was beginning to
love the new house, I was in the attic one evening,
pushing suitcases and boxes around, trying to stow away
things like Christmas ornaments, when I felt a crack in
my head, as if it had split down the middle--a complete
division. I had a mental picture of one of Picasso's
two-headed women. I felt like two people. I sat down
on a suitcase and held my breath. Had I had a stroke? I
wasn't paralyzed, at least not actually--only by fear. I

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was the strangest sensation I had ever had. There
had been no warning that it was going to happen. One
moment I was fine, working, thinking logically; the next
moment, with no apparent shifting of gears, I was an
entirely different person--two people, in fact.


I did not know what had happened to me or how I
had got to where I was. At that moment, the anguish
that flooded through me cannot be described. Everything
was totally unfamiliar--a barren, desolate waste-land.
I realized remotely that a complete, devastating
crackup was in store for me.


That night the noise of water running in and out of
a fountain outside my window in the rose garden, a
sound I generally loved because it sounded a little like a
stream, became unbearable. I slammed all the windows
shut and put my head under the pillows.


A woodpecker had been visiting us every morning
and had been hammering on a piece of metal with which
we had covered the tops of our chimneys to keep out
squirrels. One morning he made such a deafening noise,
I felt the whole house tremble. The noise echoed and
reechoed through the rooms, thundering in every corner
as if the plumbing had gone berserk all over the house,
and all the pipes had become human and were screaming
to be let out of the walls that enclosed them. I lay
awake every morning waiting for the woodpecker,
dreading his coming, and dreading his not coming.


Now the bureau that I had had since I was a child

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did not dare go to the village. I was sure I looked
queer and that people were whispering about me. I
looked in the mirror. I did not look like the <i>me</i> I once
knew, but I had not developed a hump or deformity
that showed.


I was trapped in the house. I could not phone
anyone; they'd know I was queer. I could not answer
the phone either, because I could not talk to anyone
sane. I thought, "No one likes me, no one comes near
me, no one cares. I do not want them near me
anyway--there's something terrible I can't tell them.
They mustn't come to call; I will run and hide if they
do; yet never have I needed people more and never have
I been less able to see them."


If I went out, I thought, "I am being followed." I
tried to hoe the weeds in the garden, but I couldn't
finish the job. I hate to leave a job undone or
unfinished. But "they" were watching me and following
me, and "they" frightened me to such an extent that I
couldn't even do that simple task. I thought that I must
have done something awful to be followed that way.


I wanted to go in the swimming pool. It was too
cold and deep. Everything was cold, yet everyone kept
saying it was the hottest summer in years. I felt cold; I
felt the <i>weight</i> of it. It pressed in on me, on my heart,
on my stomach, on my body, and on my mind.


I tried to leave the house to seek comfort in my
children, to reassure them that I could still do things
with them. They drove me to the club one day, and we
tried to play tennis. I was so weak and uncoordinated--I

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Poor children, did they know what was happening
to their mother--what she was thinking? If they did,
how horrified they would be, and frightened. I did not
think the show was fooling them, but I hoped it was. I
wanted to hug them, clutch them to me, to say, "Never
let me go." I wanted to say, "I am slipping so far away
from you, and I need you more even than you ever
needed me," but there was pride and the wish not to
frighten--them. I must use iron control--what's left. I
must hide in my room, because the control is getting
less.


I tried taking the children to Coney Island. I
wanted so much to stay part of their lives, and share
things, and laugh with them as we had so often done. I
looked in the funny, distorted mirrors. We all laughed
and shrieked, but inside something told me, "You really
look like this. Your mind is like this. It must show
outside as well as inside." I had feared the roller coaster.
I thought the children were disappointed in me. I closed
my eyes and blocked my ears while going endlessly
through the dark tunnel of love, because I felt trapped
in the crowd and I wanted to get out and run ahead of
the train on the track. The sudden noises and shrieks
hurt my head. The crazy house, with lopsided rooms-were
they lopsided or was I? I was pale and shaken. The
children fed me a pizza pie; they were worried and
suggested we go home.


How touching are children who grow up to worry

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I must have been very distraught. The children
would say, "Where have you been? You are not
listening."


"I don't know," I would answer.


I felt I'm there and I'm not there, and I know they
feel it, and I know they are there, and yet they are not
there, to me. I wanted to ask them, "Who am I? Please
tell me. Do you belong to <i>me</i>, or <i>I</i> to you?" But they
were too young to guide me back to my previously
known world. If they, with their love, could not, who
could?


I tried going to a party, and I think I was the only
one to stay sober (drinks and drugs don't mix), and my
stomach ulcer, which had been bothering me for almost
a year, was raising hell. Liquor was no escape for me.
But I knew I was the only one there off balance. I am
very nearsighted. If I don't put my glasses on, everything
is blurred; yet, when I put them on, they made
everything too big. I tried to answer questions through a
dense fog. I doubt if my answers made much sense, but
then I doubt if the questions did either. I don't think
anyone was making enough sense to know that I wasn't
making any. I looked at people and thought, "Suppose I
come right out and shout, 'You know, I'm terrified that
I am being followed, and that's why I keep looking
behind me! Do you see anything too? And do you know

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All I knew was that I was more and more removed
from my surroundings. Everyone looked different and
strange--even the people closest to me.


I was outside of myself, watching me all the time.
This had happened occasionally in the past--I would be
looking at myself doing something--but now I could not
merge the two anymore. I wanted to stop looking at me
from the outside, to get back into the inside of me. A
small part of my brain remained sane enough to look at
the insane part with horror.


My God, if I could only sleep. Insomnia had
become an obsession. I lived in a haze of tranquilizers,
sleeping pills, and other medicines to keep me sane, I
suppose, but there was no blessed oblivion and no sleep.
There was only endless wakefulness with no escape. The
more I tried to sleep, the less I slept. "Eternal sleep
would be the only peace for me now," I thought,
"where there would be no room for these horrors that
keep running through my head. Oh, God, anything to
end these endless minutes like hours. Time stands
still--it has stopped forever. Has a second gone by?"


When you are well, there is never enough time for
the things you love and care about and want to do and
accomplish. Now I started at daybreak to dread time, so
I began to make plans to protect myself against the next
night and that awful brain that would not be turned off.
If I slept, a drugged sleep, I had nightmares that dragged
me into horrible places where I did not want to go.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Disorder" of the mind is a good word. I, such an
orderly person, couldn't make any order out of the
chaos.


The intellectual and the emotional were so intertwined
that I could not separate them--or else they were
so separated that I couldn't get them to meet; I did not
know which. Everything emotional, I could put on an
intellectual level, and say to myself rationally, "This is
not rational." I could take an emotion like panic and
put it on an intellectual and thinking level. "What is this
panic?" I could ask myself quite rationally about my
irrational thought that I was being followed, and
answer, "No one is following you, so why panic?" But
the intellect seemed to have lost touch with the
emotions--some line was down, as in a storm.


One of my strangest and most devastating situations
was my inability to pick up a newspaper, book, or
magazine or even to look at television without identifying
myself with every bad thing in it. I seemed to have
taken on the guilt of the whole world.


I picked up my children's edition of Beatrix
Potter's <i>Peter Rabbit</i> because the pictures comforted
me, but I wept at the end because I had never given my
children camomile tea--even a rabbit had a better
mother than I had been. Had I done something good
once?

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How strange that terror, overwhelming terror,
should be so inarticulate! I wished I could just scream
and beat my head against the wall. Instead I paced and
paced around the house, or I was frozen, immobile,
paralyzed, afraid even to turn my head for fear of
shaking loose my brain from its moorings--its once sure,
safe, and familiar moorings.


"Where am I and what am I? I have lost the bit of
me that I once was. I'm a complete nonfunctioning
nonentity, with no identity that I can hang on to--lost
--lost--lost. There is no me, no self--I don't exist; yet I
must exist, to suffer so."


It would never end, would it? Not if I didn't end it.
A mind like mine was now could never get well. The
children were the only brake that stopped me from
killing myself.


Why had I turned so completely against myself--
not against anyone else, not against the world, but just
against myself? How could people think that people
who were not rational did not feel? If I were the kind of
disturbed person who thought she was Queen Victoria
all her life, and remained safe and happy in this
delusion, and never came out of it, I believed I would
find life more bearable. Total madness would be a
release.


It was getting harder and harder to drag myself
three times a week to the doctor's office alone. My
heart beat so I could not breathe when I started to go
there, and before I dared go in the door, I had to walk
around the block at least once. Was I afraid I could not
tell the doctor those terrible thoughts of mine, or was I
afraid of what he would say when I did tell him? Did it

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I went into his waiting room, I resented all
the other people who were there taking his time. Some
of his patients looked strange, and all appeared to be
shrouded in a veil of mist. In fact, I felt as if we were all
at the bottom of an aquarium. "Good God, do I look as
distraught as some of the other patients?" I asked
myself.


I hid behind a magazine. I knew the doctor gave
shock treatments there, and this was in part what caused
my panic. I knew that was why some patients were
accompanied by a relative or a friend. I did not dare ask
the doctor if he thought I needed shock treatment.


After seeing the doctor, I talked to his nurse. Even
though she was too busy to talk, she did for a while
each time. I did this just so I could stay a bit longer in
the safety of the office; although it terrified me to
come, it terrified me more to leave--for where would I
go?


I would leave the office and wander through the
streets, uncaring if I was run over--aware that once or
twice taxi drivers had yelled at me. I would have to hang
on somehow until the next appointment with the
doctor.


The last interview went something like this:


Me: "I don't exist anymore; there is no me."


Doctor: "But I see you sitting on the other side of
the desk from me. Aren't you?"

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048383-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Me: "Yes, but I've lost my mind, so I am not really
here."


Doctor: "You came here alone, didn't you?"


My eyes focused on the paper cutter on his desk. I
tried to concentrate on his voice. "Please, voice, never
stop, help me find my mind. Please help me fight for my
life, please help me find myself."


Me: "You must do something. Do you know what
I did since I last saw you? I tried to get my shotgun out
of our gun cabinet. We always keep our shotguns locked
up, and I could not get at the guns. I was going to kill
myself. Where do you think I must go? You must have
me put away. Why, why am I thinking of doing these
dreadful things? I am stark raving mad. You must stop
me; you've got to." I could hear myself shrieking.


Doctor: "Now, look, you are not going to take
your own life, and you are not raving mad."


Me: "I'm crazy, I'm thinking crazy things. You
know it's crazy to want to kill yourself, and the fact I
want to do it must mean I am crazy."


Doctor: "But you have not killed yourself. You
say you think of nothing else--yet you come to me and
you want me to stop you."


Me: "I haven't done it, because I know I am
insane. This isn't me, it's someone else. Oh, God, to
think I tried to do what I told you."


Doctor: "You will get over this."


Me: "No, I will never get over it. I can't rest, I
can't stay still, not with this plan in my head. My mind
won't stop ticking. It begins at dawn, it goes all through
the night, begins again at dawn; it never stops, I go

Doctor: "Never mind now...."


Me: "But I do mind--there's so much--I can't stand
it. There's a voice in me that says, 'Kill yourself,' and
one that says, 'Don't kill yourself.' I hate this fog of
drugs I'm in--I tell you, my head is divided in two. Do
the two sides of my face look different? No, don't look
at me, no one should look at me."


Doctor: "You look the same as always to me, only
more miserable. Why do you think you've lost your
mind?"


Me: "There is no me anymore, so how can I tell
you about losing my mind? It doesn't matter about
killing myself--my mind is dead already."


Doctor: "You are here, aren't you?"


Me: "Yes."


Doctor: "If you are here, then your mind must be
here too."


Me: "Oh, what's the use of anything? Nothing is
the same--it never will be again. I can't carry around
these thoughts and terrors anymore. It all gets more and
more unbearable. I will do something awful to myself."


Doctor: "Now, I am right here, and nothing is
going to happen to you. You will not kill yourself,
because I will not let you. I will help you, and we will
get you well, you and I."


Me: "What is wrong with me?"

Doctor: "You are temporarily emotionally very
disturbed. This does not mean that you will not get
well."


Me: "You've got to protect me--from me."


Doctor: "I am going to put you in a hospital."


Me: "What kind of hospital? Locked?"


Doctor: "Let's say it's a hospital geared to your
needs at present."


Me: "Oh, God ... what horrible, ominous words."
