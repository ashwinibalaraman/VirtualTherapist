BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So you're mad at me?
<b>PT:</b> I didn't say that, I was really very hurt, I, I was taken back because she yelled at me about something that we, that happened and I was just thrown all the way.
<b>DR:</b> What did I yell at you about? 
<b>PT:</b> Okay, I mentioned something to you that I thought I was getting a little dementia.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because I couldn't remember certain things, you floored out, you flipped out, you said what, did your sister tell you that or something because you know my sister goes with these things. I just felt terrible about the whole thing.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I really apologize, you know, I usually don't do that. So you may have been, you know I can't imagine.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE] And then I said I guess he was so busy or something...
<b>DR:</b> No, no, I'm not allowed to do that, you know, that's within, but yeah, so, when I saw you though, let me go through my notes.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> I saw you [DATE] you got into an agitated state after being on Zoloft for three weeks.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You had racing thoughts, you were confused, you had high energy, your sleep was okay. You didn't have bad judgment.
<b>PT:</b> Um hum.
<b>DR:</b> You stopped the Zoloft and that remitted it and then I have all your memory testing here so we went very specifically over...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You had to remember three words, you were oriented.
<b>PT:</b> I know I didn't do well with them at all. 
<b>DR:</b> No, you did fine.
<b>PT:</b> I did fine?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I, I mean you were worried about the slow decline in your memory but you really did fine.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b> Your sleep and appetite were fine so we thought that you were doing okay but you had it in you that you wanted to stop all your meds because of the memory thing and that may have been...
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember saying I wanted to stop my meds.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I have it here that you wanted to stop your meds.
<b>PT:</b> That was the...
<b>DR:</b> Zoloft?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, the Zoloft because it flipped me out. The first three weeks in and then it just flipped me out when I got to the higher dose...
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I went berserk.
<b>DR:</b> Well it revved you until what we call hypomania.
<b>PT:</b> I went berserk.
<b>DR:</b> Well [INAUDIBLE] 
<b>PT:</b>  Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Right, racing thoughts, talking too much and you felt that it's very...
<b>PT:</b> I was out of control. 
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] with anxiety. But anyway, then we talked a little bit about your memory problems. We evaluated it with specific tests and you were fine.
<b>PT:</b> I thought I didn't...
<b>DR:</b> You did fine.
<b>PT:</b> Do well at all.
<b>DR:</b> And so people, in my experience, people have two aspects of cognitive problems. One is true cognitive problems and the other is being worried about having cognitive problems and you clearly fell into the latter, you were worried about having cognitive problems and given your anxiety conjure, your style, it is very hard for you to hear, you know, sometimes anxious people can't hear things very easily. You keep reassuring them and keep telling them something and they just can't hear it. They're stuck and so, I mean, I hope I didn't yell at you, but I imagine I may have upped the anti and eventually said, enough already. You don't have memory problems that I know.  Let it go.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> All right. 
<b>PT:</b> Well I felt very bad about the whole thing and I didn't know whether to come back here or not and I just did a number on myself, but I here...
<b>DR:</b> I apologize.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> I apologize and it won't happen again and in the future, if I'm making you upset in that way tell me right then and there, I have thick skin...
<b>PT:</b> I glad you didn't stop yelling at me.  Why are you yelling? 
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>PT:</b> But you - yes, yes. 
<b>DR:</b> Maybe I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
<b>PT:</b> No, I think maybe, maybe because it was very busy that day too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> It was extremely busy, it was like you had three people at one time waiting outside or something so I figured....
<b>DR:</b> Well now that's never an excuse.
<b>PT:</b> Well all right.
<b>DR:</b> I should never behave that way towards you and it won't happen again, I promise.
<b>PT:</b> Thank you.
<b>DR:</b> But, but if it seems to be happening, or you perceive it that way, stop me right then and there and tell me, you promised never to do it again.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so let's get back on track and I hope you'll forgive me?
<b>PT:</b> Yes I will.
<b>DR:</b> You, so what we did was, we got you off the Zoloft. We stopped, oh that's right so I stopped the Wellbutrin because I see the Wellbutrin can sometimes give memory problems too. So we stopped that.
<b>PT:</b> Well you said to cut it down.
<b>DR:</b> I got here we stopped, we had cut it down the time before.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah right.
<b>DR:</b> To 150 and then I told you to stop it.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You're still taking it?
<b>PT:</b> I'm taking it.
<b>DR:</b> You're taking 150?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You still have memory problems?
<b>PT:</b> I was going to tell you that since I stopped the higher Wellbutrin, I'm calmer because I was having problems, not cognitive with the Wellbutrin, I'd jump up during the night and I couldn't catch my breath or something and I would just get up and walk through the door or something. I think that might have been too stimulating. Now...
<b>DR:</b> You were taking it in the morning the Wellbutrin?
<b>PT:</b> No, I think, I think it was twice a day.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I think it was twice a day and now I'm, I'm feeling like much calmer. I'm not trying to catch my breath. I was sitting up in bed trying to catch my breath.
<b>DR:</b> Well, those, those might be sub-threshold panic attacks.  Getting up in the short of breath state.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Unless you have a medical problem.
<b>PT:</b> No, now I'm fine.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so currently you're taking 150 of Wellbutrin and 2.5 Zyprexa.
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> And a half milligram of Klonopin twice a day, correct?
<b>PT:</b> That's right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, and in these two months, how has your mood been?
<b>PT:</b> Calm. I'm not happy, but I'm never happy. No, my mood, my mood has been...
<b>DR:</b> You're mood's okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're generally not anxious?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you're generally not sad? I didn't ask for happiness. Happiness is your problems. Your brain is my problem.
<b>PT:</b> I think I some people think I'm generally sad, let me forget about some people. I just, I don't sing and dance, you know, I'm not a singing and dancing person.
<b>DR:</b> You're drained, but as far as the depressive illness put a weight on your head, that's not there.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It's just that your life is not...
<b>PT:</b> It's boring.
<b>DR:</b> You're bored.
<b>PT:</b> Because I make it like that.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, well, not my problem, that's yours. 
<b>PT:</b> Right, exactly, exactly.
<b>DR:</b> That's yours. Fix your life. Do whatever you have to do. I'll get your brain to the place where you can do it, but your life is your problem.  How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b> My appetite is not great.
<b>DR:</b> Are you gaining or losing weight.
<b>PT:</b> No, I'm status quo, I think I gained a pound, [PHYSICIAN NAME] has taken loads of tests that will be coming back in two weeks.  She's really on the ball.
<b>DR:</b> She's very...
<b>PT:</b> Really on the ball. She's testing me out.  I said where did you get all the blood that you're taking from me? You know, so in fact she just run the test but she...
<b>DR:</b> She's very kind too.
<b>PT:</b> She is, she's, she's very nice, she's very nice. 
<b>DR:</b> All right, so your appetite's fine, you sleeping well?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That means you get the sleep that you need to, you sleep through the night, you wake up when you want to?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> You're energy's decent during the day?
<b>PT:</b> I never was very energetic, I mean, I'm not falling away, I like to sit around a lot...
<b>DR:</b> Are you dragging or...?
<b>PT:</b> No, not at all.
<b>DR:</b> So your energy's okay, now you take a Klonopin in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Why do you need that one?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know because I've always taken it morning and night.
<b>DR:</b> Let's get rid of the morning one. Well we could try at least, because, you know, if anything that could be dragging you down a little bit.
<b>PT:</b> Ah.
<b>DR:</b> You know the side effect is sedation.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> So, if you don't need it. If there's not as much anxiety juice being produced anymore, why, why throw this type of medicine into your system.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I saw that the other day I said I'm taking this Klonopin stuff forever. It must be years, about 7 years or something.
<b>DR:</b> And you know what, with your memory complaints, it could also interfere with your memory.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> So let's get rid of it.  I mean, if you need it we'll give it back to you.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But, you know, why be on something...
<b>PT:</b> In the morning?
<b>DR:</b> And that means that in the morning you'll only be on the Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So your energy's okay, any exercise? Do you walk a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't go out that much.
<b>DR:</b> What do you do most days?
<b>PT:</b> Oh, sit and watch television or else if I have to go shopping I go shopping. I kind of got out of, stopped the Tai Chi, I don't know I'm sort of boring.
<b>DR:</b> How's your psychotherapy going?
<b>PT:</b> Very good.
<b>DR:</b> She kicks you in the butt a little bit?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, she, she's on the ball there...
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't seem to be having much effect.
<b>PT:</b> I am who I am.
<b>DR:</b> Listen, I'm not judging you in anyway whatsoever. It's fine with me if you lay in bed and watch movies all day.
<b>PT:</b> I don't lay in bed.
<b>DR:</b> I bet you can, it doesn't matter.
<b>PT:</b> I know, I know.
<b>DR:</b> It's so unfortunate that you're so judgmental of yourself...
<b>PT:</b> I know.
<b>DR:</b> That you need to think bad things about yourself for doing what you want to do. Listen, you raised five, five...
<b>PT:</b> Six.
<b>DR:</b> Six kids
<b>PT:</b> And a husband.
<b>DR:</b> And a husband, you're tired, you deserve to do whatever you want to do.
<b>PT:</b> I went out and bought some new furniture, that was a plus, I've been wanting to do that for ages and ages and ages and ages. Okay I'm going to do it so I'm kind of ticking off a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Right, what kind of furniture did you get?
<b>PT:</b> Living room furniture, a couch and a chair and I'm waiting for my son to get me a recliner because he promised me a recliner.
<b>DR:</b> An Archie Bunker chair? You watch TV and...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, right, right I need a free TV.
<b>DR:</b> Any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> Never.
<b>DR:</b> Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b> Not hopeless or helpless, blah.
<b>DR:</b> Flat?
<b>PT:</b> Flat, flat that's, that's...
<b>DR:</b> You don't get as much pleasure as you should?
<b>PT:</b> I don't try enough.
<b>DR:</b> You don't get, see pleasure has two components, anticipatory pleasure and consumatory pleasure. So anticipatory is looking forward and driving yourself to do things, whereas consumatory pleasure is the pleasure you get when you do it.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Sounds like you could get fine consumatory pleasure...
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> But it's the anticipatory pleasure that you don't ...
<b>PT:</b> Right, I don't put myself out there.
<b>DR:</b> Put yourself out there.  Your drive, your humanistic drive is not, not as ...
<b>PT:</b> No I just don't, I just don't, in fact I can't stand crowds more than ever. I can't stand crowds, I can't stand pushing on a train and every, I really can't stand it. I like peace and quiet. I go out, I mean I do what I have to do, I go shopping, you know, do my house, whatever...
<b>DR:</b> But you're pretty withdrawn?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I would say so.
<b>DR:</b> Do you do anything socially?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Do you see the kids?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, oh sure.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah, yeah, I'm in touch with the kids.
<b>DR:</b> Are you able to read and concentrate?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, I read a lot. I started taking up reading again, I love to read because it takes me out of where I am and puts me in a different place.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't make sense that you're so unhappy, I, I, can't understand it.
<b>PT:</b> I don't like crowds, [PHYSICIAN NAME]. I freak out, I stopped going to the center, you know the senior center that I used to go, I just, I just can't stand crowds, crowds of people.
<b>DR:</b> Why, what's wrong with crowds?
<b>PT:</b> It's too noisy. It's too noisy and...
<b>DR:</b> It overwhelms you?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Does anything help that?
<b>PT:</b> Does anything help that, no.
<b>DR:</b> Medication?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Has anything ever made that easy?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I never was a ...
<b>DR:</b> Right. But when you're taking the Klonopin, does that take the edge off of that or does it like...
<b>PT:</b> I'm comfortable with the Klonopin. I don't know what its doing or if it's doing anything, I'm just used to taking it.
<b>DR:</b> Well it's for anxiety though.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah well if that's what it is then it works.
<b>DR:</b> Are you feeling anxious when you're out there in the crowds or just...?
<b>PT:</b> Uh...
<b>DR:</b> Or just put off because you don't like the chaos.
<b>PT:</b> Sometimes anxious, sometimes anxious, sometimes anxious. 
<b>DR:</b> Well to the extent that it's anxiety, the Klonopin will help. Remember we're pulling away the morning Klonopin. If you find that you're even more withdrawn without the morning Klonopin, then you should start it up again. Does that make sense to you?
<b>PT:</b> It makes sense and I think maybe I shouldn't stop it. Maybe I'm just so used to taking it and I'm afraid of stopping it because I just won't get out of bed maybe.
<b>DR:</b> No...
<b>PT:</b> No?
<b>DR:</b> I'm not buying that. Let's just give it a few days or a week off it...
<b>PT:</b> All right I'll do that.
<b>DR:</b> If things are noticeably different then go back on.
<b>PT:</b> I can do that.
<b>DR:</b> It would be nice to get rid of things that could be dragging you down every day.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, okay.
<b>DR:</b> And you know, the Wellbutrin will give you a jump start. Now the 2.5 of Zyprexa, you pretty happy with that?
<b>PT:</b> What are you telling me?
<b>DR:</b> Are you happy with the night time medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Doesn't bother me.
<b>DR:</b> Gets you to sleep, no problems, not gaining weight...
<b>PT:</b> No, I told you I'm sleeping better, gaining weight, the doctor advised me to gain weight, I don't gain weight, you know, I'm not that big an eater but she feels she's going to start me with vitamins or something, whatever, she really pushes at me. 
<b>DR:</b> She does?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, she's very good. 
<b>DR:</b> Have you been since I saw you manic in anyway? Any high energy, revving up, raciness?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And you haven't been depressed either, just the usual demoralized, bored, you know, flat, low energy, self.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And even though we tried to give you antidepressants for that it didn't quite work, it blew up in our face.
<b>PT:</b> In my face.
<b>DR:</b> Because it revved you up, it grabbed you into a manic like state. So, I think we should, probably let the psychotherapy try to address some of these chronic demoralized, you know, not having the umpf to do things, you know try some psychotherapy. I don't think medication is going to be the ticket. Do you want to spin out?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> No, you don't need...
<b>PT:</b> I don't like... No I don't want to be like this, I'd rather be like this, I pull myself...
<b>DR:</b> But the only thing I can think of to give you some umpf that you seem to lack is a stimulant, you know, some juice, but with you it's a mixed bag. I don't know.
<b>PT:</b> Because I am a mixed bag that's why.
<b>DR:</b> You're a mixed bag.
<b>PT:</b> Um hum.  But I'm basically okay, I mean I'm calm, I never was a jumpy happy go lucky person.
<b>DR:</b> More than that, compared to where you started, you're doing amazing, you're doing amazing. I mean we essentially pulled away your mood disorder and now the rest of it is, you know, just your life issues. 
<b>PT:</b> Right and that's up to me.
<b>DR:</b> But your mood disorder used to be active all day every day with anxieties and depression and manias and every moment. Right, if we ask your children....
<b>PT:</b> Ah, my children, they think I'm a nut period. Take a pill ma.
<b>DR:</b> You were a nut.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Now you're okay.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah I think I'm okay. I'm think I'm okay. Nah, people are just concerned sometimes that I don't...you know, I don't go out much, but this is my choice, you know, have a very active life.
<b>DR:</b> I've given up trying to get you to... 
<b>PT:</b> It's my choice.
<b>DR:</b> It's your choice and it's a reasonable choice. What did we say here you were [DEIDENTIFIED], right? [DEIDENTIFIED]. I need you to sign.
<b>PT:</b> My real name? I'll sign it.
<b>DR:</b> Well you can, make it illegible, it doesn't you know, and also here.
<b>PT:</b> You were going to. Do I get a prize or anything? Let me tell you something, many years ago I used to go on panels...
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> And I loved it.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You like being...
<b>PT:</b> I loved it. You know, testing different things with a group, I liked it very much. And they paid you a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> If you want to learn about it you can read that.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so, we're set on this. You're going to stay with the Wellbutrin, stay with the Zyprexa and only take a night time Klonopin.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Correct?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Let me see you again in two months.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> Okay?
<b>PT:</b> Okay. Okay.
<b>DR:</b> You forgive me?
<b>PT:</b> Yes...
