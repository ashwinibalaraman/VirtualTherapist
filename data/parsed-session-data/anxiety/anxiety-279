DAVID


David G., at the time of his hospitalization, was a 21-year-old
senior at a Western university He was approaching
the end of his college career with a great deal
of concern about his future. Though he had already been
accepted by a prominent law school, David was not certain
about his choice, of vocation, and had also given
some consideration to medicine and writing. David
knew that his father, a lawyer, had also encountered difficulty
in choosing a vocation and had taken a kind of
moratorium after college by going abroad to participate
in a foreign civil war. The experience had been disillusioning,
however, and Mr. G. had given up his idealism
completely, directing his attention to making money. In
many ways, Mr. G. considered himself a failure, and
though he made a good living for his family, he was unhappy
with his accomplishments. He had managed to
purchase a very expensive home, though there always
seemed to be outstanding debts.


Mrs. G., long intimidated by her husband, sought psychiatric
assistance for intractable asthma two years before

David had a special girlfriend, Laura, who had been in
psychotherapy for two years. Their relationship was
characterized by a great deal of sexual experimentation,
with David frequently doubting his own sexual ability.
Separations and reconciliations were violent, highly-charged
experiences, much in the fashion of the relationship
between David's parents. In mid-February Laura
had dated a boy in another city and refused to tell David
the details. He immediately fantasied that Laura had engaged
in intercourse with her date and wrote a very vindictive
poem to her, calling her a whore. Having mailed
the poem, he felt angry and guilty. A trip to another city,
where he visited friends, served only to assure David that
they had their own troubles. Following his return, he
wrote a short story entitled "Test To Be a Man" in which
the storyteller finds that his best friend has stolen his
sweetheart. He became even more overwrought when he
learned that a lifelong friend, Nathan, sided with Laura
in her quarrel with David. This discovery prompted him
to write Nathan a "hate letter," accusing him of betraying
their friendship. At this point, David essentially confined
himself to his room at college, attended a few
classes, but spent most of his time—day and night—at
the typewriter attempting to get his thoughts on paper.

Sunday, Feb. 22-wrote letter to Laura,
severing.


Weekend, Feb. 28-fled to Cleveland, no good.


Monday, March 2-wrote story "Test To Be a
Man."


Friday, March 6-found Nathan sympathetic to
Laura, story comes true.


Sunday &amp; Monday, March 8 &amp; 9-two hate letters
to Nathan.


Monday &amp; Tuesday, March 9 &amp; 10-intense
anxiety.


Wednesday, March 11-partial solution (intuitive)
in letter to Nathan.


Friday, March 13-ended diary.


Saturday, March 14-began self-analysis.


March 17-case closed.


The following day he found his way to the hospital
emergency room where he presented a picture of intense
fright, pressure of speech, ideas of influence and reference,
and autistic thinking. The diagnosis, based on
clinical data and psychological tests, was acute, undifferentiated
schizophrenic reaction. Later, when his parents
visited his room at school, they found the typed account
that is reprinted below. There has been some deletion
and condensation where certain sections were repetitive,
but otherwise the account has not been altered in any
way.

She had said she loved me (bopping off to Providence
in between protests I suppose I could swallow
that though) but I don't think if it were ever
true, that she still does. (N told me that, told me just
like that and the reason he hadn't called was cause
he was playing pickup sticks with her date he's so
charmingly forthright I puke).


His logic is so good he can laugh at his own [girl]
having her insides torn out he's so positive and rational
and knows just how everything works including
one divorce, one abortion that he's undoubtedly
reassured her everything's all right such a
good friend midwife to disasters a cool guy that's
what so even if she does still love me (she was so
cold on the phone) anyway so cold her voice on the
phone she wanted to chat I fantasied suicide for
twenty-four hours ... twenty-four hours you begin
to scare yourself like that wanted to chat bragged
she'd burned ‘everything’ (I wanted to ask if that
everything included thirty dollar cashmeres doubt
it) chat about her date etc. If he had been alone I
would have killed I promise if I believe anything is
left in myself I promise I would have killed but he
was only there as a friend so that solution would
have been disproportionate honor among friends (I
had asked him not to meddle asked him as a friend
ha ha) being outdated anyhow no one not even me
would have understood not being able to kill him

I have a right I do have a right to hold that bastard
responsible ... my game wasn't pretty perhaps;
I wanted her to relent first, that's all, just relent first
that much of the double standard I hold by if that
means double standard but she bore the burden she
ran off on me I had a right ... she made no attempt
at apology that night none none so we're both
prideful but all I wanted was an I'm sorry even to
the letter I wrote, horrible letter designed to humble
and that's all just asking an emotional sacrifice an
ego sacrifice on her part something she had been as
little willing to make as I was ... but she couldn't
do it with that snake whispering in her ear someone
for her anyone for her to talk to excuse herself to but
me.

Story will be turned down today for the simple
reason that it's lousy. I don't realize things like that
before I've shown them all over town ... at least
then I'd avoid having my vanity take as bad a beating

Hemingway lost a whole suitcase full of his earliest
stories and was thus forced by the world (conveniently
that world which kills the bravest, gentlest,
blest etc.) to start again. Maybe if I can find a
suitcase will get lost. The one real advantage of suicide
is that at least there wouldn't be a reception at
the Master's house afterwards. I want a war like
Hemingway had ... it isn't fair ... I never learned
to shoot squirrels either.


What a sad thing! There is nobody any good
around anymore ... I was going to be the last one

I'm becoming a monomaniac it's incredible it
just doesn't stop there are moments when I can do
no more than tear up matchbooks futile futile
things and others of greater lucidity when I can see
so clearly what went wrong why we were unable to
commit ourselves each coming to the brink at different
moments I came to her that evening at her
house felt my insides dissolve with wanting, expecting
to burst free she put me off good put me off and
put me off and then 12 hours later when the thing
lay sticky like bile inside me then only then we went
to bed together and she had her orgasm and I did
crossword puzzles. Did she ever come at me yes I
suppose, at the beginning, too fast too desperately
when she knew there was no chance and was doing
it on her doctor's advice and I kept telling her I was
no therapist that wasn't my job not my job. But that
letter should have been a test it was a test I wanted
her to make it on her own without help confronting
everything but she dragged in a surrogate she
dragged in my lily-livered friend and he came galloping
to the rescue in all the accoutrements of
maiden rescue and good will. There are moments of
lucidity when I see how close hate and love can lie,
back to back, moment to moment I could kill I
could love I lie here tearing up matchbooks. My
story was rejected and I think I mucked an English
test this morning. Will do the same for a French test
tomorrow. The big test is still ahead or behind I tear

I can't cope, I can't come to grips...it's Hawthorne's
disease blazing away, red guilt or little
stringy black warts (they're growing with a virulence
I swear I never noticed before)...music helps
a bit and I've conducted the Eroica all over the room
three times already today, waving my arms and occasionally
hitting things...all very dramatic...to
think I worried myself about sleeping too much last
fall! I've given the jargon a once over; it stems from
incest drives, castration fears, masturbation complexes,
homosexual doubts, oedipal fixations bullshit
bullshit it was around before the jargon and it's
got me...already at table I've been making curious
unconscious slips as if the synapses suddenly rot
away and I come disconnected it's all right it's all
right I'm going to be a lawyer and make lots of
money and grow up to be as weak as my father as
torn as my mother look ahead!! Be a good little benjy
franklin and don't despair; simply write down

Rereading this time, I just noticed a terrible thing
...I'm such a short sighted misanthrope that I will
never be able (in a particularly severe paroxysm of
self pity of course) to give this to any of my friends
...There isn't a single one I've spared much less
said a good word of! I'm sorry really. The obvious
solution is to send it to Laura and then blow my
brains in (I'd prefer to fall on a sword but I'd probably
take it through the forearm) that way she'd feel
bad about burning it. Egotism the bosom serpent, I
need a good priest.


<i>Midnight, Tuesday-Wednesday</i>


Every last bit of it, right to the bottom of the stable
get out all the crusted horse dung leave it spic
and span so there will be place for more. Cause like
they say there is knowing and then there is knowing
and I know anything at all...I know how to type
ten hours running and drink beer (thank god the
beer was around I'm broke and down to my last two
cigars and not a bit sleepy yet) but I don't know
what to DO and that's what counts most of all. Or
does it? It appears I'm out to prove the cliche about
the intellectual...except I'm no intellectual so that
is solved, or maybe it proves the cliche about the
tortured jew, but then I'm no jew either. I sure
know all about what I'm not. This little dispatch
from hell is really turning in on itself like a seashell

One ray of hope (the first branch, Mt. Arrarat is in
sight, get all the animals ready to debark the hell
out of here particularly the snakes and spiders) that
is my regrets and nostalgias seem to be coming closer
on the heels of my debacles last time it took me
two years to realize that I'd made a mistake with
Laura, this time it took me two weeks, but maybe
next time (three strikes you know the pitch?) well
maybe next time I will have killed Nathan first...a

How can I hate myself like this?


<i>Thursday, March 12, 11 A.M.</i>


I'm out! I'm through...boomed out of the tunnel
sometime last night and it's raining stars...
whooey...it's nice out there's time for everything
...I can do it I did it and if it happens again I'll do
it again twice as hard I got a dexamyl high going
and I'm not on dexamyl and I've been up for forty-eight
or more hours and I'm giddygiddygiddy and I
took a test this morning and it was on Voltaire and I
kicked him a couple of good ones for being down
on Pascal that poor bastard with his shrivelled body
and bottomless abyss they're not bottomless!! You
get down far enough and it gets thick enough and
black enough and then you claw claw claw your
way out and pretty soon you're on top again. And I
licked it by myself, all alone. No pandering psychiatrists
or priests or friends by myself. Now, I
must admit I'm a little leery; I dashed back to the
typewriter to give it form to write it down and sew it
in my vest like Pascal so if the Thing hits me again
I'll have this in my vest and I'll kick it in the teeth
again but Pascal saw God and yet still it hit him

I got a few confessions to make. Still, I think I did
overflow a bit on other people and that is just a trifle
bit humiliating since I knew they couldn't help
anymore than a psycho and then, yesterday afternoon
I trotted over to the third floor of Univ. Health
and the woman said Well, we have two openings
next week maybe we can fit you in and I thought
about that guy who got put off like that and
launched himself from the roof and will never fly
again and thought for a while how bad I was going
to make them feel having history repeat itself and
came near to slamming my fist on the receptionist's
desk (having made that great sacrifice in the first
place...ah pride) and nearly shouted That's nonsense

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048391-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Oh jesus christ I still don't really believe in anything
I just got myself too worn out to care. I'm
pretty sure Kierkegaard had something to say about
this but if I get any more names and quotes and
things in my head my ability to make fun of them is
just going to go pachunk and I'll give out altogether.
No dice. Me I'm still flying.


The coincidence of my break up with Laura with
imminent graduation and the inevitability of law
school combined with pressures from home have
kicked off these bouts of self-doubt and account for
the virulence of the blue bear (subconscious, warts,
dreams etc.) White is wrong or Freud or whoever
insisted that dreams are pure wish fulfillment...or
rather, the wish may be very subtle...a wish to
punish oneself...because certainly my greatest
wish at the moment is to beat this thing and I certainly
haven't dreamed any victories yet. How many
years did it take Freud? I'll bet he didn't have any
french paper to write for tomorrow. No that's for
sure.

ANNOUNCEMENT: A new campaign is on
against the word "maybe." When I stamp out
maybe maybe I'll stop smoking. I tremble seeing
how close I came to the brink. How do you like
that? I repressed the whole reason for writing this
time...I knew I had missed something (ha ha
won't get away from me blue bear I'm hot on your
tail) my story was truer than I wished to believe
(changing hair color location and all etc.) I had taken
Nathan as symbolic of some male principle and
was tormenting myself with...he's just as stuck as
most of us, he just has great and clever specialized
intellectual faculties...so that the irony of my
story coming semi-true was also too much to take
and aggravated my sense of betrayal. That letter to
him then was not completely sincere...I don't
want him to do my courting (that was the doubt
about the manliness of the favor) I just wanted to
apologize to both of us and maybe duck the decision
to go after Laura myself because after all, I'm not
sure that I need her if she represents no more than a
test. Well, we'll see...maybe the test wasn't such a
bad idea because if she's got the guts to take me back
she's a big enough girl for me and we'll see what
comes of it. I was half exposing myself, half proving
myself, half boasting to her and hurting her,
half admitting my problem and half challenging
her to save me...no one saves you Christ was a fool
you save yourself. Let me qualify that, you don't

<i>March 12, Midnight</i>


I mustn't test it yet ... I've got to keep quiet ...
I've got momentum habits of exhibitionism and
I've come to grips with my own doubts but the resolution
hasn't been strong enough to sustain the
doubts of other ... I can't be a proselytizer because
the essence of my discovery is that there ARE NO
doctrines that living is a day by day affair I do much
better talking about monopoly I LIKE to talk
about monopoly I LIKE to touch things and listen
to things I CAN'T support Greg's problems I
start proving myself to him QUIET QUIET
SHUT UP AND SILENCE I can see too well what
happens I go on a grand flight and halfway up it
sounds hollow and then to save face I begin to
force and push and I can carry him along for
a minute but he always comes down before I do and
then my stomach just caves in ... the thing is too
fragile to test yet ... if it were only based on a permanent
thing on an absolute on God capital g on
Love capital L but it isn't and I don't want it to be
even Fromm became a doctrinaire and then he was
no good anymore I wish I could pray god give me

I must pursue the analysis and not talk about it. I
know what I must do. Right now, with eight hours
to go I must stay awake (I feel like I've been up for
two weeks) and do the french paper ... Laura once
said it is going to be fun falling in love with you I
was flattered but I didn't understand now I do ...
what do they say? Take it as it comes? Right that's it
... just take it as it comes too bad we didn't ... too
bad? What am I saying ... a damn tragedy ...


HUMILITY let's go right back to the text books
right back to the puritan primers cause after all they
know what they were talking about and if I've done
it then what I've done is to secularize and personalize
their solution and I must keep my trap shut.


But jesus I feel that I've changed I really do I've
never felt this way before I'm even beginning to
trust it a little bit...so if you are introspective then
BE introspective ... all the way ... you come
through the bottom and out the other side and
there's a world out there just waiting to be eaten
played on lived with worked for jumped up and
down upon made love to sung about man I'm six
years old.


I could be simply overawed but in rereading this I
see an incredible, an astonishing structure ... automatic
writing but there is development, there is
almost an internal plot ... the hand of god? Or of

I think I just passed the acid test, I passed
through an absolute web of complexities involving
the person who had posed the greatest threat and
did so with what came close to serenity ... I wasn't
dead (as John later tried to suggest in a veiled form
of attack) ... I liked the music and the coffee and
the people and the perfume and the women but I
wasn't upset! I wasn't driven back against that wall
of incriminations self-accusations self doubts etc.
that used to clutter up my people encounters. It
went like this:


John

the period of the diary. He becomes concerned about the possibility of
homosexual attraction to John.</div>
and I were talking on the usual subjects of
identity and function in life (he talks so beautifully
one would never guess!) I was attacking him as the
symbolic beatnik the person who has given free
reign to his unconscious who refuses to live a structured
existence and identifying him with his brother-in-law
Richard who did so badly by his sister etc.
I can't do John I haven't even begun to do myself
... suffice it to say he got back to his high school
experience which represents for him a dangerous
but exciting search for identity in others, various
attempts to graft himself onto more stable environments
(that's where he picked up the business about
the Jewish home ... boy did that bug me when he
first came out with it!)

I have been leafing through Jones on Freud again
(I shouldn't ... I can and should do this on my own
maybe I should? What am I afraid of finding out?) I
will and it was a positively thrilling discovery that
Freud's feelings of greatest worthlessness, as evidenced
in his letters, came just prior to his greatest
discoveries. But that went on all his life ... will
mine? who cares ... Freud lived on, riddled with
cancer thru a world falling apart with his religion
being exterminated exiled from his own country
and he kept working ... he still knew what he had

Everything now conspires to my cure, my whole
body aches to be better (slips of the typewriter ... is
that possible?) I hadn't realized how sick I was ...
the bloody stools or at least my queer satisfaction
with them was in my head ... or libido or whatever
one calls that amazing thing! I awoke after four
hours sleep so as to continue ... went to take a
shower, brought along vitamin pills (after all I
don't want to die physically in the process of living
emotionally) joked into the mirror saying automatically
"Swallowing a bitter pill, eh?" And then, instead
of leaving the pills on the tray over the sink I
went right into the shower with them clutched in
my hand ... I can't stop now ... and didn't realize
until I was standing there staring at them in amazement
(absent mindedness and what I do under it is
another subject for analysis ... absent mindedness
was on a terrifying increase just prior to the Day)
... Falling sleep last night a thousand million
thoughts bubbled then the number the age 18 what
happened when I was 18? (my stomach hurts ... it
really physically does ... that blue bear has all
kinds of tricks ... I'm going out for coffee) Well I
DO have to go out to get some money but I MUST
be merciless with the blue bear. He has no quarter
for me ... he keeps asking too much demanding too
much (my father kept asking too much love of me
more than I could show him because my mother
would have beaten me what a funny reversal of roles
come to think of it that is about what I was going to
do) in any case it threw up tests too hard to meet I've
recently said that if I can't commit myself both to
marry Laura and to apply immediately to med
school then I'm no good ... I know I can't meet

<i>Comment</i>


This document describes the inner experience of a sensitive,
articulate individual in the throes of a serious
personal crisis. Although there appear to have been multiple
pressures (impending graduation, choice of vocation),
the timing of this crisis was apparently determined
in part by an event which David construed as evidence
that he had been rejected by his girlfriend. In addition he

The psychotic episode thus can be seen as an event
which transpires <i>when</i> David's life is at an impasse,
when personal development and inner liabilities interact
to stymie him. Treatment of such conditions almost invariably
involves measures to remove some of this kind
of pressure. Vocational decisions, plans to leave home,
etc., must often be delayed and approached more
gradually.


Another characteristic of the content of psychotic
states which is variously depicted in individual accounts
is the sense within the subject that the experience is ultimately
purposive and is related in a substantive way to
psychological growth. In the present case, one can see
this patient wrestling with those life tasks he has been
called upon to master but has not. Faced with graduation
and a career choice which would identify him with
his unhappy father, overwhelmed by failure and guilt in
a sexual relationship, and plagued by a conflict-laden
family environment he must learn to leave, this man sits
down to set in order in a few days a young lifetime of
difficult challenges. He seems curiously drawn to the task
as if he felt that adequate resolution of it would result in
significant inner growth. It is as if something were forcing
a number of issues at this stage of his life, and he
seems to have well in mind—even if they are hopelessly
entangled—the principal people involved in these
issues.

This account also illustrates some of the formal characteristics
of psychotic states that were described in the
previous chapter. For example, this account is characterized
primarily by a "psychedelic" altered consciousness.
In reading it we obtain a feeling for the way that his
experince is inundated with thoughts while being driven
toward resolution. Of particular note are the affective
shifts which he experiences. Periodically he seems to
sense a kind of illumination which temporarily sets his
mounting anxiety aside, as when he writes, "I'm out!
I'm through ... boomed out of the tunnel sometime last
night and it's raining stars." or "I could be simply overawed
but in rereading this I see an incredible, an astonishing
structure ... automatic writing but there is development,
there is almost an internal plot ..." At other
times he is floundering at the nadir of despair: "I can't
cope, I can't come to grips ... it's Hawthorne's disease
blazing away, red guilt or little stringy black warts ..."
The formal characteristic of rapidly shifting cognitive
grasp and emotional tone will be apparent in many of
the accounts that will be presented. The flood of new or
unfamiliar material into consciousness forces attempts
at heroic coping and compels explanation. We may
reasonably wonder what the significance of this new
material is. For instance, in the present account, what is
the significance of David's question about his possible
homosexuality toward the end of the diary? Do we regard
the emergence of such specific concerns as clear-cut evidence
that these very conflicts are crucially involved in
precipitating the current psychopathological state?
Young men in the throes of a psychotic reaction often
develop concerns about homosexuality or fears that they
may be feminine. Does this mean that the essential conflict
in such individuals has to do with homosexuality
or, by contrast, is it likely that a host of incompletely
