People who knew me as a child, as well as those who met me later on,
throughout my years at university or as I started working as a teacher,
keep wondering: Could it be true? Could it be that a charming, intelligent,
pretty, smart person like me was hospitalized because of
anorexia, actually wished to die, and spent most of her adolescence
away from the world? Knowing myself now, I also sometimes
wonder. Was that really me who experienced all those horrible
things? How could I have survived it and stayed sane? Have I
changed? Am I a different person?


Some people look back at a difficult time and say: ‘That wasn't me.
I can't recognize myself But to be honest, I can't say that. So much is
still the same. I am the same person, with the same thoughts and
emotions. But I am older and smarter, and I suffer less. I can see the
first signs of my disorder in myself as early as when I was a small
child. From where I stand now, a so-called normal healthy woman,
looking back at the process of how my anorexia developed, I can
almost say that it was inevitable, that it had to be. It was a natural
process. Natural? Not for everyone, but for me, yes. A natural
outgrowth from where I was, from the way I was raised, and from
how I developed. When I look at the worst time in my life -- in the
hospitals -- I don't see that any new, unexpected behaviors or
emotions suddenly appeared as if by magic. Rather, I can see all those
parts of me that had been slowly growing since birth. Who could
have known then that they would turn into anorexia?

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet, as I look at myself now, I must admit that nothing has actually
changed. I can't really say that I'm a different person today than that
girl in the hospital or that child before her. I am the same me. The
same person, with the same internal doubts, suspicions, emotions,
and thoughts. Still struggling and coping with the same issues. But
how can I say that nothing has changed? Then how is it possible that
today I'm a happy wife, mother, and human being? Me -- the expert in
suffering and pain. The miserable soul. How can it be that I'm
normal? Am I recovered?


I think I know. Yes, it is the same me, the same person, the same
inner materials, the same doubts. However, my perspective about the
world is different now. Along the way, in all my suffering, I made a
detour, acquired a new perspective, and learned to trust and care for
myself, not only for others. I have learned to redefine my pain, and to
express my emotions differently, but what has changed the most is my
behavior. My basic thoughts remain similar to what they were in the
past -- I've only labeled them differently. I continue to be overly
self-critical, checking and rechecking myself. My emotions are still
very complex, still encompassing a lot of ambivalence, sometimes
fears, and always the need to be accepted by others. It's true that some
of my emotions are different now: I also have happiness, fun, exciting
feelings -- and I've learned to accept all of them as a normal, healthy
part of my life.


My behavior is what has changed the most. I certainly no longer
act the same. Now, when I sometimes get those same thoughts and
feelings -- about the world, myself, evil, and fears -- I can tell myself
that I should never act the way I used to. And I know that I will not
regress. I know that I will not be hospitalized again. I will never harm
myself again.


I know now that my old way of looking at the world -- the dichotomous
view of good and bad, of right and wrong -- does not exist. I
wasn't only bad, so I couldn't become only good. Each of us is a combination
of things. Now I can also accept that I am a good human
being who has the right to live.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At 25 years of age, with a history of 7 years of anorexia, about 12
therapists, 24 different kinds of medications, and 5 different hospitalizations
in 5 different kinds of hospitals, I am still not sure what was
wrong. Were the hospitalizations and treatments essential? Where
did my problems lie -- in family, society, or me? Could I have become
me, the person I am today, without being hospitalized? Perhaps I
would have been a better person. Who knows? Maybe it was just
meant to be. Maybe it was a kind of catharsis. A mind -- clearing, crystallizing
process that discarded all the bad within me, and then let me
start living again, as a better person.


Sometimes I wonder: Was I conceived with these problems? Now
that I've become a mother myself, I've become sensitive to my baby
son and what he has been experiencing throughout the pregnancy. I
believe that even before being born we feel things. We are aware of
the world around us. I am sure my baby knew how happy and anxious
we were for him to come into the world. Was I aware of the world
before being born? Did I know about my parents' fears, anxieties, and
ambivalent emotions? Did I feel neglected or afraid while alone in the
incubator? I have no idea.


I don't know how to explain the fact that I changed but actually
remained the same person. Maybe I just learned to accept myself and
live with myself. Maybe what I learned most was to make peace with
my soul, and with my environment. I feel good, and I enjoy life.
Sometimes the thoughts do come back. Is it because thoughts are
harder to change than behaviors? Is it because they are too deeply
fixed within me to be changed? Is it because I want to keep something
of the old me? Often, I start thinking and rethinking, trying once
again to understand: Why do I have these problems, and who is responsible
for them? It is true that each person is responsible for his or
her own life, and for whatever meaning he or she imposes onto it.
Does that imply that I, and only I, am responsible for the development
of my anorexia? Yet, at the same time, it's also true that we have
an inherited set of behaviors deep inside us. So, does that mean that I
inherited my anorexia? Are my family history and genes responsible?

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

And I have a good life now. I'm happy. In fact, it's the happiest time
in my entire life. I love my husband, my children, and I can even say
that I love myself. I love my husband, who shares all my difficulties
with me. We both adore our baby son, and we know we will raise him
with lots of love, trust, and confidence. I am not even afraid that he'll
develop my disorders. How do I have this security? I don't know, but
something is going very right for me lately. (Tammie would probably
say: ‘It's not going right for you. You're the one who makes it go right
for yourself. It's not by chance -- it's where you lead things. You
control yourself and your world. You are doing and acting right for
yourself.’) And I believe in my love and my wish to nurture my son.
With love and caring, and with my husband's help, I know I can.


I even feel very happy with my relationships with my two sisters
and my parents. For many years, I had such complicated relationships
with them, especially with my older sister. I used to envy her and
compete with her, but now she has become a good friend. My
younger sister has grown up. I always felt lots of affection toward her,
but she was young. She wasn't a part of my life, of my growing up, of
my suffering. She was too young to share feelings with. Now that
she's matured, now that she's started asking questions and has
become curious and interested, we've become closer.


With my parents, it's a different story. I was not an easy child. It
was not easy for them to see all that I went through. I always challenged
their love, their understanding, their trust. It was not easy for
all of us to experience what we did over the years. Now, as a mother, I
can appreciate how difficult it was for them to deal with my sickness,
and what they've gone through. For many years, I blamed them for
the way they behaved. I hope our closer relationship now will help
them understand that it was part of my sickness that caused this
blaming and accusing. I looked at myself as a bad human being and I

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now, I am happy I have my parents. They are terrific grandparents,
and we get along wonderfully. I deeply hope that my mother and my
father -- who both used to try so hard to hide things -- will not be
offended by my book. I hope they understand that all the things I say
about them in this book relate not to the absolute truth, but rather to
what I felt with and lived with then. I love them, and I appreciate
them. I am sorry if telling my story will cause them sorrow or pain.
But I feel I have to tell the truth, and my truth includes my ambivalent
feelings toward them, my anger and my criticism.


Why am I writing this book? Several years ago, I told Tammie of
my wish to do so. She tried to change my decision, fearing that it
might harm me to expose myself to the public. But I am stronger now,
and feel the need to do this. Part of it is that I'm learning to understand
myself better via the writing process. Part of my motivation is a
yearning to complete the story. Ending the unfinished journey of my
growing up and maturing. Finishing unfinished business. I feel I have
to do this in order to leave my sickness far behind me. And another
part of my motivation is to help the world understand. I have been
treated by so many people, and many of them didn't really change
anything in me or for me. What I felt then was that they didn't really
care about my real spirit. I know it was very complicated, but I felt
that they never stepped back to take a look beyond all the mess and to
find me, to see me. I hope I will succeed in conveying what I feel. And
I truly hope that this book will help people understand what we --
anorexic girls -- are going through. Maybe it will give some clues to
therapists in making decisions about how to treat us. Maybe it will
help parents understand their children better, or be more optimistic.


First, I will try to show what occurred throughout my life that influenced
my sickness and my soul and behavior.

<font size="4"><b>2: Childhood: Exploring the Roots of My Anorexia</b></font>
[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am not sure whether my conception was planned. I was the middle
child, with one sister two years older and another sister eleven years
younger. My mother was a kindergarten teacher and my father was in
the army. I was born prematurely, in the seventh month, and weighed
4 pounds 3 ounces. There was no premature infant intensive care unit
in the hospital where I was born. Therefore, I was transferred to
another hospital in order to be hospitalized until I gained weight and
was out of danger. I was transferred alone, without my parents. My
father came to visit me every day, but I was treated and fed by the
nurses. I was so small. My mother was not confident enough to take
care of me, and she got scared and panicky whenever she saw me. My
father, trying to protect my mother, did not tell her the truth about
how fragile I was. He didn't want her to know that I continued losing
weight and that my life was in danger. My father was the one to visit
me every day, and he informed my mother about my condition to the
extent he felt she could handle. I stayed at that hospital for six weeks
before I first came home. Sometimes I wonder: Can it be that, even as
a very small infant, I felt neglected? Did I miss my mother's touch?
Maybe there lie the roots of my insecure feelings and lack of confidence.
Whenever I think of it, I keep hugging my child close,
promising him and myself that such an experience will never happen
to him!


If we believe that even a young infant knows and feels, if we
believe that birth and the first few days are crucial for the child's development,

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A child usually cannot look at his or her parents as complete personalities,
as full human beings, something beyond just the parent
figure. Usually children view their parents as a role model, worshipping
them and thinking them perfect. Only when they start to mature
during adolescence do children begin seeing their parents' deficiencies.
Then they start accepting the fact that their parents are only
human, like all the other people around.


For me, as for all other children, it was important to be appreciated
by my parents, to be accepted by them, and to fulfill their expectations.
I believe now that a major component of my disorders stemmed
from my feeling that I was never good enough. I always felt I was not
what my parents wished me to be. Unlike other children, I could not
see my parents as perfect. I could see who they were and what I liked
or disliked in them. But I blamed myself for seeing their deficiencies,
instead of just understanding that they weren't perfect. As you will be
able to read later on in my writings, I had the need to arrange my
world in very clear concepts, and in a simple order. For me, things had
to be either good or bad. I could not accept the fact that people are
not only good or only bad, but are a combination of each. I was
confused by trying to understand who is good and who is bad. I had

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>My Mother as a Role Model</b>


My mother's most significant trait was, and still is, her sensitivity.
Now, I can say that this sensitivity -- her wonderful ability to express
herself, to express emotions, and to understand emotions -- is
something I like and inherited. It's something I really enjoy and
respect, and I consider it a very important characteristic. However, as
an adolescent, it was hard for me to understand her behavior and
emotions. Her sensitivity made me angry. Sometimes I'd get confused
and want to run away from her. I always feared that her over -- sensitivity
would turn into anxiety. My mother is definitely a very anxious
person. Her anxiety was something that disturbed me as far back as I
can remember, and still continues to play a very important role in her
life. She fears everything. She fears making mistakes, fears causing
harm, fears not doing something right. I think that very fearfulness
was already there when she was afraid to take care of me, when I was
born. That's how I view the way she raised me, and that's how I see
her now, with my child. She is afraid of feeding my son because she
isn't sure how warm the food should be, what kind of bottle or
amount of food he needs. She keeps complimenting me for being so
brave while giving him a bath and for taking care of things that I see
as very natural and don't give a second thought.


Her anxiety goes together with her over -- protective behavior. It
was that very combination of sensitivity and anxiety that always made
her so over -- protective of me. She always felt she needed to protect us
from being hurt. Maybe she believes the world is dangerous and she
needed to protect us and make sure we'd be safe. I have no idea why
she is like that. I don't see these character traits in my grandparents.
But I certainly inherited some of it. In a strange way, I made a shift in
my mother's idea of the world as a dangerous place. I turned this view

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My mother's mixture of over-sensitivity and protectiveness interfered
with her ability to educate me, use limits, be consistent, and be
direct with me -- all elements that I now understand to be crucially
important in raising children. Even when my anorexia started developing,
my mother found it difficult to insist that I eat normally or to
make me go to therapy. For a long time, I took advantage of these difficulties
that she had, and would do whatever I wanted. However,
when she eventually realized how serious my condition was, she was
so anxious that she did not even dare try to take care of me herself or
treat me at home. Instead, she immediately agreed to my hospitalizations
and accepted those doctors' diagnoses. Much later, that same
anxiety also caused her to discharge me from the hospital, fearing that
my soul would get lost there. Again, it is so hard to say when good
things stop and bad things start. I love her sensitivity, I suffered from
her anxiety, and I think what disturbed me most was her unexpected
shift between the two. I could never know if she was going to care for
me so as to hide me from the world, or if she was about to let the
world take me away and treat me outside.


Another of my mother's traits is her perfectionism. This belongs to
the same family of emotions as does sensitivity and anxiety. Her
anxiety and over-protectiveness led her to perfectionism. Ever since I
was a small child, I remember my mother as a very perfectionistic
person. I saw it then in her very obsessive way of cleaning and her
need to have everything around her be immaculate, a trait that I
probably acquired from her. I think of this each time I change my
son's clothes because they're spotted. Of course, her perfect way of
doing things made many achievements possible for her, as clearly
shown by her academic accomplishments. My mother recently

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

These circumstances of studying together bring up the very complicated
symbiotic relationship between me and my mother. My
mother insists on taking the same courses I take; she wants us to study
together and thinks it would be fun to learn together and share this
experience. I don't want to hurt her, but I don't feel confident sitting
with her in the same class. I'm happy to share materials or help her,
but I don't want to see her among my friends. Is it because I'm afraid
of not being the best? Is it my fear of competition? Anyway, I'm not
sure it's good for the two of us. I never shared these feelings with her,
and I hope she will not be angry while reading them in the book.
Maybe it will open up a new opportunity for us to discuss our relationship.
Because, as much as I criticize her, I have to admit that I
really love her, care for her, and appreciate her. What a complex
situation!


I both like and hate this perfectionism that I inherited from her. I
know that perfectionism is what enabled me to receive good grades in
school and to succeed in everything I did. Yet it also made me suffer
from the gnawing need to always do things the right way, and from
that ever-present fear of making mistakes. I always felt I had to be
perfect, like her, in order to be appreciated. The truth is that she never
asked me to follow her lead, but she was my role model for doing everything
the right way. Ever since birth, I never settled for less than
the best. If I wasn't good enough, then I considered myself to be very
bad. This is a sentence you will probably be hearing from me a lot.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My perfectionism led me to tear up my drawings as a child. I never
felt they were good enough, or as good as my sister's. I didn't want to
settle for second best, so I'd get rid of them. It was the same with my
grades in school -- I had to be the first in class. And it's still the same
now, as a wife and a mother -- I still need to be perfect.


I guess it was the combination of perfectionism and anxiety that
led me to constantly feel uncertain, to always hesitate, and to feel such
a lack of confidence. My parents’, and especially my mother's, great
uncertainty and demand for flawlessness while raising me must have
influenced me significantly. They loved me, but they often argued
intensely about things and gave me double messages. My mother was
never sure about how they should treat me as a child and, most of all,
as an adolescent who needed to be hospitalized. I now can see my
mother as a very weak woman. Today, she is very excited by the way
we're raising her grandson. What guides us in raising our child is to
behave naturally, trusting that our love will guide us to do the right
thing, being sure that we will never do anything to harm him. But my
parents did not have this trust and were always afraid of causing harm.


As I started dating my boyfriend, and later on became pregnant, I
often talked with Tammie about my fears of harming my children. We
tried to understand, together, what made me the same but also so
different from my parents. We talked about what could reassure me
that I would be able to raise children who would grow up normally.
One of the things we discussed was the fact that my wish to do things
right didn't make me anxious, as it did for my mother. Rather, it
makes me eager to learn and to improve. But maybe the most
important thing is that, in therapy, I have learned to trust myself.
Instead of thinking of myself as an ex-hospitalized crazy person, I've
learned to think of myself as a strong person who grew tremendously
and improved as a result of my difficult experiences.


Growing up, I felt I always had to justify my actions in terms of
what others would think of me. My life felt as if I was flowing along a
river into which I had been thrown, without really having control. I
sensed that I had to be on par with others, but I couldn't. I would

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>My Very Different Father</b>


My relationship with my father was completely different from that
with my mother. Young children usually start out by seeing their
parents as one identity, as being the same: ‘My parents want me to...’
I could never say that, because they were so different from each other
that I could never combine them into one parental unit. My father was
much stronger. If I had to draw them, I would draw my father with his
legs rooted firmly on the ground, and my mother would be flying in
the sky. Many times, his strength reached the degree of rigidity. My
father could not understand doubts, hesitations, or double messages.
For him, to this day, things are very clear cut. His life is much more
strict, simple, and clear than my mother's. He thinks in black and
white and is not concerned by all the complex emotions that
preoccupy her.


I was extremely aware of these incongruencies during my illness.
For example, at that time my mother was preoccupied by trying to
look at the significance of everything: ‘What do they really mean
when they say that Ayelet is in danger? Do you think she could die?
Do you think she'll commit suicide? Will she become crazy? Does it

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I feel better with my father now. Maybe therapy helped him
express emotions better, or maybe I've learned to read and understand
his emotions better. I used to think that he lacked sensitivity, but
now I think that he was just confused and overwhelmed by the
amount of emotion that my mother and I hurled at him, and he simply
did not know how to deal with us. I believe that my father has always
been a sensitive man who just doesn't know how to show it, or how
to talk about emotions. He probably always knew what he felt,
although he never really said what he felt or wanted.


Although he is a very quiet and introverted person, my father is
someone you can lean on. I think his strength was already obvious
from the time I was born. My mother used to cry, fearing what would
become of me, worrying if I would ever overcome being a premature
infant. She was probably so scared that she couldn't function. My
father was the one to visit me at the hospital, feed me my bottles, and
dare to hold me in his arms. While he was not able to express emotion,
he was certainly able to do the right things when needed.


It appears to me that my parents complemented one another. They
divided up their roles. My mother took on all the emotional parts of
worrying and crying, whereas my father was the one to depend on,
lean on, and trust to do the hard work. It disturbed me that my father
never expressed love, caring, or confusion. It disturbed me that he
would, at times, get angry. Even when I was hospitalized, he used to
demand that I eat and be angry at me for not eating, while my mother
just gave up and cried. What I didn't understand then, but I do now, is

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One thing that both of my parents agreed on was the need to hide
things from other people. For my parents, showing the outside environment
that everything was good, even ideal, was very important.
You never wash your dirty laundry in public. Consequently, they
made me hide my craziness, my sickness, and my problems for many
years. In fact, they were extremely angry when I told my boyfriend
(who became my husband) the whole truth about myself and my past.
They were sure he would leave me as soon as he heard that I had been
anorexic. I'm sure that the amount of effort they invested in encouraging
me to hide the truth is inextricably connected to my constant
yearning to be completely honest all the time. My need to tell the
truth about myself has even caused me many problems, for example
when I thought my college teachers should know about my past.
After this self-disclosure, they worried about letting me study special
education, fearing my craziness. But I'm getting ahead of myself,
since these are recent events from the last few years, near the end of
my story.


<b>The Middle Child</b>


I have no doubt that birth order influences the way we grow up, and
the role we take on in the family. I am the second child. I believe that
my position in the middle of the family affected my development.
Being the middle child for me was actually being two different
figures. I was the spoiled younger child for eleven years, but being
two years younger, I always felt I was not quite big enough. I saw my
older sister as the most beautiful and smartest person in the world, as
a role model -- and as my parents' dream daughter. Everything she
did, she was perfect at. That's why I tore up my drawings, that's why I
envied her. I wanted to be her. I tried but never succeeded in
competing with her. It was a lost cause from the beginning. She was
so good. She always met their expectations. There was nothing bad to
say about her. She knew how to dress well, how to talk with others.

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After 11 years, I became the middle child. I loved and worried
about my new baby sister. But even here, my parents allowed my
older sister to care for my new baby sister, while I was considered too
young, not responsible or trustworthy enough. With no responsibilities,
I felt pushed away and disappointed. Only four years later, when
my older sister was in the army and my parents went abroad, was I
finally left to take care of my younger sister. Although at age 15 I was
already anorexic, I was entrusted to take care of her for a week
between hospitalizations. Again, what a double message! On the one
hand, I was not to be trusted to even care for myself: I needed
someone else (the hospital) to take care of me because I was a danger
to myself. On the other hand, I was entrusted with taking care of my
little four-year-old sister.


At the time that my parents made the decision to leave my sister in
my care, I was actually in the hospital. My mother decided to take me
out of the hospital. She saw that I was depressed, suffering, and had
lost my joy and ability to laugh. Maybe she had become accustomed
to my anorexia and was not as worried as before. My mother said that
if my life was in danger, she'd rather have me die physically (of starvation)
than die emotionally (lose the ability to express emotion,
become depressed). My parents decided to honor my wishes to return
home and discharged me. But here, once again, I find myself relating
things that happened much later.


As a child, I felt my younger sister was too young to understand
what was going on in my life. And I was actually afraid she might be
negatively influenced by me and could develop anorexia as well. So
there was a distance between us, and we didn't develop a close relationship.
When she started growing older, I often found myself
observing her eating habits, trying to make sure she would be

<b>My Grandmother</b>


A special figure for me since birth was my grandmother -- my
mother's mother. She is a survivor of the Holocaust. Her parents were
killed, and she was left alone at the age of 12 to raise her younger
brother. She always kept all her suffering and pain from the
Holocaust inside, never talking about it. Maybe this caused my
mother to hide and refrain from talking about things. Only last year,
when she was interviewed by the Spielberger Foundation about her
experience in the Holocaust, did my grandmother begin to open up
about it.


My grandmother is a very balanced person, with really remarkable
self-confidence and behavior. Growing up, she symbolized for me the
shift between being demanding and supportive. Despite her life
history of starvation, settling for very little, fearing capture and death,
and fearing the future, my grandmother was the only one who did
not try to push food into my mouth. She was the only one who
treated me in very direct, clear, unobscure way. She was the one to
whom I ran when I argued with my parents and felt the need to run
away from home. She protected me and asked my parents to leave me
alone. Several times during my adolescence, she became in charge of
my meals, because my parents could not cope, and with her I used to
eat. What characterizes her most of all is her direct and straightforward
way of talking, without hiding and without apologizing for it.
Therefore, she has always been the person I felt best with. You can

I often wonder why she did not become a parental figure, a model
for me. Why didn't I become more like her and gain more self-confidence
and have less doubt? I still don't understand how my mother
came to be so different from my grandmother. It seems as if my
mother acts like the Holocaust survivor, rather than my grandmother.


<b>A Summary: What I Acquired from My Parents</b>


As I re-read this, I am painfully aware of how critical I am toward
everyone. Maybe this was one of my problems. I never liked myself,
so I found deficiencies in everyone around me. Maybe only later on,
when I felt the strength to accept myself as a human being who had a
right to live, could I accept others and see their advantages. Therefore,
I hope my parents, my sisters, and my grandparents will understand
that actually seeing the bad behaviors in their lives was part of my
constant search for my internal personality and my self-criticism.


If I look at the big picture today, I can say that, since my birth, I
have acquired several major ideas, characteristics, and aims from my
parents:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>The need to do things perfectly</i>, which was the reason for my
success in school, but at the same time was the reason for
my anxieties and fears that I wasn't good enough and that
there was no place in this world for bad people.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
• <i>The fear (or actually, anxiety) of not doing things well</i>, which
lowered my self-confidence and sense of trust in my own
self. I never felt safe enough. I always suspected my abilities.

both of them as highly admirable and extremely hard to
compete with. I always felt jealous, thought I could never

do things right, and tried to fit what others expected me to
be.

• <i>An obsession with cleanliness</i>. Even today I sometimes have
these obsessive thoughts that I'm dirty and evil, not clean.
Vomiting used to be a kind of way to let the evil out of me.
Rationally, I know this is not right, but I can't change these
thoughts. Today I feel compelled to clean my child's room,
change his clothes, etc., and these feelings even affect my
sexual relations. When my husband kisses me, I turn my face
away -- I don't want him to be disgusted by me. Since I
disgust myself, I'm afraid he'll be repulsed. Strange as it
sounds, I have no problems like that with my baby. Maybe
because he was inside me, he won't be disgusted. I can
easily kiss him.


• <i>The need to hide</i>. As a child I always felt ashamed. I always
wanted to hide. Usually people hide when they do wrong
things and think they need to run away. I was always
running away from myself, from others, and from the world.
Now I feel as if all those years of running from people
affected me in a way that makes me need to run toward
people. I am not hiding anymore. To the contrary, I am
opening up to everyone. I am going in the opposite
direction. I feel the need to tell the truth to the people
around me and to be honest with myself and others. And
also I feel the strong need to express emotions, to help
others, to do the right thing, to do good, etc.


All in all, my perfectionism, anxiety, and feelings of worthlessness
grew stronger and stronger as I matured. As I said before, I can
attribute these to the way my parents educated me, and to my mother
as a role model. Just as I mentioned above, I can also relate my wish to
talk openly and tell the whole truth and my urge to avoid hiding
things, however bad they might be, to my rebellion against my
parents' wish to conceal the things of which they were ashamed.

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Yet I must admit that my being intelligent, smart, and pretty are
also the results of being my parents' child. I also learned to express
emotions, and I even learned to love. So, my family background is not
a one-way street. I inherited good as well as bad characteristics. All I
can say is that I inherited many good things that I thank them for,
many problematic things that I had to struggle with, and some bad
things I will never be able to get rid of and will have to learn to live
with.


<b>And What I Developed Independently</b>


I don't think that my idea that I was bad came from my parents. I
think this is something that I developed within myself. I often used to
think what people could see if they looked inside me. One constant,
since the time of my birth, was an idea that accompanied me intensely
throughout my life: ‘I am bad’, ‘I am not deserving’, and ‘If they knew
who I really am, they wouldn't want me.’ Right now I can say: ‘Well,
this is not true. I am not bad. I help others. I am a good human being. I
care for people.’ Yet this core idea still guides me, and sometimes even
disturbs me.


As I try to look back at my past now, and to understand how I
became who I was, some things are very clear. The idea of being a bad
person was always there. Since I was bad, I had to be punished. So, as
a young child, I remember myself doing something bad just to receive
the punishment. I knew I shouldn't do those things. I knew those
things should be punished, and I looked forward to being punished. I
knew I deserved it. I did not reject it, and I was waiting for the punishment
to come. Sure enough, the punishment always came. I was never
surprised when it did.


My problems with eating were also there from the beginning. My
mother tells that, as an infant, I used to vomit a lot. She always
prepared extra bottles so that I could have another one after I
vomited. She always feared I would not get enough to eat. She always
expected me to vomit, and I always fulfilled her expectation.
However, in contrast to my mother's memories, I remember myself as

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So, as can be seen, parts of who I was as I embarked on my illness
were things that I inherited, parts were things that I developed
myself, and many parts were things I learned merely by living in the
world in which I lived, in the environment that surrounded me.

<font size="4"><b>3: Between Me and Myself and My Social Relationships: Finding Creative Expression for My Loneliness</b></font>
[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

From early childhood until now, my fear of society has shadowed me.
I have always felt insecure and restless around people. I always felt
unequal, unaccepted, and not understood.


Even as a young child, at age 4 or 5, I remember myself fearing
other people. I was very shy and always tried to stay close to my
mother, to hold her hand or sit on her lap. I remember that, during
celebrations in preschool, it was hard for me to actively participate,
and I would not agree to leave my mother's side. I used to sit on her
lap, looking at other children dancing, singing, or performing, but
refusing to take part. Deep down, that hurt; I envied their freedom to
behave as they pleased.


Later on, as I entered elementary school at the age of 6, it was still
difficult for me to interact with other children. Throughout all the
years of elementary school, until the age of 14, I didn't like being
around groups of many children. So, I found one friend. Her name
was the same as mine -- Ayelet -- and I stuck with her. We were very
close friends, and we used to play together. We had fun, but I
continued feeling anxiety and fear. Even when the two of us were
alone, I didn't feel good. I'm not sure if she would say the same, but I
remember feeling we were in a constant state of competition. I always
felt like I needed to prove that I was better than she was. Of course, I
never thought I was as good as her, or could be better than her, but I

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I never overcame this shyness. I grew up and my problems grew up
with me. As a young adolescent (12 to 15 years old), this same
problem continued to follow me, although it showed another face.
The shyness developed into anxiety. I think they now call this
behavior ‘social anxiety’. Whenever I was around more than three
people, I was tense, uncomfortable, anxious, and wanted to run away.
I felt as if I'd been left alone in a crowd. I remember a metaphor that
appeared in my mind throughout my adolescent years. In that
metaphor, I could see myself as in a cage of glass. I was inside it, and
the glass surrounded me. No one could hear me, and I could not hear
anyone. When my anxiety was not at its peak, I could see through, but
when it increased, a cloud seemed to cover the glass, and I could not
see anything. I kept wondering if people knew I was there. I was
among people, yet I felt so far away, different, and lonely. Naturally,
the other children sensed my tension and also kept a distance.


Maybe my personal problems would not have been as severe if
they had not been accompanied by social problems. I was never really
an integral part of social activities or peer groups. I didn't feel good
with new friends and never had many friends. I was persuaded by my
parents once to attend a youth group meeting, and I felt terrible and
suffered through the whole meeting. I never went again. While all the
girls my age used to gather in groups, talking, laughing, joking, and
sleeping over at each other's houses, I was not able to be a part of these
activities. I never once spent a night at a friend's house. I was always
happy for them to come stay at my house, but I felt uncertain and
insecure in a strange environment. I always felt bad about the
unknown. I never entered a bathroom at school, at a friend's house, or
in unfamiliar public places. Even now, I will not enter the bathroom in
a strange place. Even now, I hate going to hotels or being away from
home.


When I reflect upon it now, I see that while growing up I kept
moving between two extremes, as if I were two different people. At

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I cannot really explain why all this happened. Years afterwards, I
tried to understand what made me feel so anxious, isolated, and
lonely. I think it must be related to my early problem of attachment --
or actually, lack of attachment. I never felt safe and confident in my
parents' presence, and maybe that prevented me from developing
self-confidence, self-acceptance, and self-trust. Feeling insecure, I
always believed I needed to satisfy others, and my wish to do everything
‘right’ aroused fears and anxiety. I did not know how to handle
my wish to be perfect, so I translated it into ‘not being good enough’.
My insecurity also always caused me to see myself as being different
from others. Therefore, I remained alone, wishing to be with others,
but giving signals of being uninterested.


Looking back, I can't say exactly when this social-individual
problem began. Some of the answers may be found among my early
creative attempts to write and draw. As a child, I quite often sought
creative outlets for my emotions and feelings. Initially, I began to
draw seriously and to collect my work at around 12 years of age. My
drawings changed dramatically over the years, but they were all on
the same kind of parchment-like paper and mostly in black pen.
When I look at them now, I am amazed to see how much effort I
invested in obtaining similar pieces of paper over a period of almost
eight years, from age twelve to almost twenty, including the times I

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My early drawings were very different from what they would
become in the future. At first, my art was in color and showed some
normal childhood features. Later, around age 14, my drawings would
become only black and white, with an occasional splash of red. At age
15, I began invariably to depict genderless human bodies suffering
and crying. Sadness and sorrow already dominated my drawings.
Almost no signs of happiness remained, despite the fact that in my life
I was not yet in a state of complete suffering.


A look at some of my early works from around age 12 to 13 (see
illustrations 1, 2, 3) reveals that, at that stage of my childhood, I was
sometimes happy, drawing themes like flowers, hands, and the sun.
However, even then, that happiness was always accompanied by
some elements of loneliness, or sadness, such as tears. All my
drawings throughout all the years were on the same size paper (a
quarter of a page) mainly using black pen, with spots of other colors.


The first drawing (illustration 1) portrayed a hand coloring a
flower, most of the picture is black, with a little red and blue in the
flower, and some yellow spots on the hand; the caption at the top
read: <i>A Memory</i>. I was drawing something to remember for the future.
The sadness is due to the fact that it belonged to the past, to the
memories. The red color of the flower was gone. In the future there
will be more tears than flowers. At that moment, the memory was
something I wanted to cherish. It still looks naive. <i>Life</i> (illustration 2)
showed the beginnings of more drama and less happiness. A child
covered by a big hat, not seeing the world around, surrounded by
dark clouds. Once again, most of the picture is black, with some spots
of red, green, and yellow. Life at that time, at the age of 12, had
already started to be dark, difficult, and fearful. In <i>Tear of Life</i>
(illustration 3), there was a small house far away, a black sun, and a big
tearing eye above. Tears were the main motif in my drawings.
Probably, they were a main motif in my life. The sun itself was black

During my first years in high school (ages 14 and 15), my insecurity
developed into a need to constantly examine and re-examine everything
I did. I was always checking, doubting, and questioning my
behavior. I was never sure I was acting right. I always felt the need to
check, to understand myself, to try to see if I read my internal motives
accurately, and to try to become familiar with my most private
emotions. I could never settle for accepting things as they were. I
needed to dig and dig and find answers, and to keep asking questions
about myself, my life, and the world.

At that time, I found appeal in an additional creative outlet: writing. I
covered many pages, writing about my anxiety, stress, and dilemmas. I
could not share my feelings with anyone; thus, I found the paper to be
a good release for my thoughts, emotions, and self-examinations.
Writing short stories, poetry, and stream of consciousness became my
major channel of communication. I continued writing throughout my
entire adolescence, throughout the time I was hospitalized. I stopped
writing when I left the last hospital and have never written again,
until now. When I was almost 14 years old, I was just about to start
high school, which I really feared. I wrote the following:
<blockquote>

Moreover, this piece demonstrates that, even before entering high
school, I was already talking about myself as if I were someone else. I
referred to myself in my writings in the third or second person in
Hebrew -- not as ‘me’ or ‘I’ but as a male-addressed ‘you’ or as ‘he’. I
think this writing style, ignoring my femininity, reflected how
insecure I was even as a child. Perhaps this insecurity was an early indication
of my anorexia.


As a young adolescent, I saw my life as peppered by dichotomies
and multiple, contrasting qualities. The past became for me a period
from which I needed to learn in order to change and have a better
future. The present became ambiguous and full of question marks,
doubts, and pain. This was the beginning of my looking at the present
as bad. I started to develop my view of evil, of an evil drive or instinct
that caused me to do bad things. I knew I was not like others. I
suffered from being lonely. I believed there was a reason, a justified
reason for everything. I therefore started thinking that if I was
suffering, it was because I deserved it. I probably deserved it because I
had done something wrong. Unable to find anything wrong in my
behavior, I developed the idea that I was suffering because I was a bad
person. Something inside me must have been very bad, and I had to

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now I can see this time in my life as waving a red flag of warning,
but no one else noticed the signs. Everyone thought I was special and
creative. They didn't realize that I was suffering and in danger. I was
already crying for help but didn't know what help to ask for, and no
one heard me. I was hoping for someone to come, hold me, dry my
tears, and persuade me that I was a wonderful person and should love
myself and could be loved by others. But no one did. When no one
understood me, I started living more and more in my fantasy world.
Life was bad, so I started dreaming and living in the future. I
developed this idea that, although I was an evil person in the present,
some miracle would change me and I would be different. I expected
myself to be a better person in the future, to be able to change my life,
to be loved by others, and to love myself.


As can be seen in the next piece, I continued writing about the
future as compared with the past, about my expectations for my
future life, and about the significance of life. At the age of 14 I still
had some hopes. I was not yet completely pessimistic. I can't tell now
whether, at the time I wrote the following poem, I was actually still
hopeful. Perhaps I was just trying to persuade myself that things
would change in order to keep my head above the rising tide of the
illness.


<i>I have lots of new expectations<br />
I have a handful of wishes<br />
I have demands I didn't know before<br />
I have needs I wish to explore<br />
I want to open my eyes and see<br />
I want to look in front of me<br />
And find a place for me to be<br />
I'd like to succeed where I once failed<br />
I'd like to have the strength to look ahead<br />
I need new skills, I need the power<br />
I need to fight and get all I desire<br />

The drive, which later on would be embodied as the bad part of me
and to which I would attribute all bad events, was already there in
existence in my first year of high school. It already symbolized the
problematic, bad, evil part of me. For a long time, I blamed my
problems on this drive inside me that made me do things I shouldn't.
This drive was the reason that I looked upon myself as a bad person,
an evil personality. It may sound psychotic, but I wasn't. Inside me
was also a small, innocent child wishing to grow up and do good,
who struggled against the bad drive. I wanted so much to be good
that I could not accept the fact that I was not. So, it was easier to put
the blame on someone else who was out of my control. Around me,
everyone else was good and wanted me to be good, and I felt I owed it
to the others to try and be good. But my efforts failed, and I was in a
constant state of fighting against the evil part within me.


I knew I was bad, but I believed I could be different. What characterized
this period more than anything else was not depression or
pessimism or my sense of being evil, but rather my overpowering
wish to be good and to change. I did not yet want to die then. But I
did already know that, if I wanted to enjoy life, I must change. Not

My poems were very similar to each other. I was very obsessed
with the thoughts of good and bad, life and death, me and the world
-- and these motifs kept returning in a like manner in all my drawings,
too. The repetition probably stemmed from my obsessiveness, but
also from my deterioration and my increasing hopelessness and
emotional dissatisfaction. Usually, I doubted whether I really had the

Although I did look ahead toward the future, my fears had
increased. I was so busy fearing, running away, and expecting things
to change. I didn't understand that, actually, the fears did not come
from the outside world but rather from within. I didn't understand
that there was nowhere to run. As Tammie used to tell me much later,
if we run away from our fears, those fears chase us, and they certainly
did then. I was hunted and haunted by those fears. Lots of fears.


I often wonder whether someone professional, a therapist, would
have been able to recognize all the signs then -- my doubts, my feeling
of being bad, my fears of the future, my fantasies and expectations. If
so, could my sickness have been prevented? Could my problems have
been solved without evolving to the extent they did? Sometimes I
think that I was only a typical frightened adolescent who was
dramatic, sensitive, and so scared that normal problems grew into a
tremendous grotesque illness. Could it have been prevented?


I guess I will always question that and never know the answer. For
me, the future could not be prevented. I was traveling at such a speed
that I could not be stopped. I had to keep going on, and I could not
stop myself. I expected the worst and, sure enough, it came. I was
looking for a better future, but I had to wait such a long while before I
reached it. I was inside quicksand, fearing I would sink, hoping to
drown, yet still looking for someone to miraculously save me. But
miracles don't happen in normal life.


Before my sickness, I hated the present and looked toward the
future. Later on, when I was sick, I could no longer see the future. I
was sunk deep into the ugly present. Or maybe it was the fact that I
had lost my future -- any dreams, fantasies, hopes, or expectations I'd
had -- that made me become sick. I don't know what was the cause
and what was the effect, but either way, my future disappeared.

Re-reading all of what I've written so far, it becomes obvious to me
that my sickness did not arise out of nowhere. The hints were there
since I was born. The problems could be found in all areas of my life. I
don't know if anyone who knew me could predict that I was going to
develop such a distressing illness. But I always knew. I didn't know
what to call it or what form it would take, but I knew something bad
was on the way. I could sense the internal signs. I could hear the cries
of warning.


I did not have social ties, which are so important during the
teenage years. Looking at society's role -- if social relationships are a
predictor of one's adjustment -- the clues were already apparent.
Alone and lonely, I did not feel a part of society. Being among others
only highlighted my differentiation.


I believe we develop our self-image by the way we are viewed by
others. We develop self-confidence when others trust us and accept
us. We start to believe in ourselves when others give us feelings of
worth. We learn to know ourselves from the way our personality is
reflected in the mirror that society holds up in front of us. We are
reflected in the mirror of society. Unfortunately, there was no mirror
held up in front of me, so I could see nothing. My parents did not help
me see myself in the right way, and 1 had no social relationships to
help me with that either. I was always blind to my own reflection,
never knowing what was real in relation to myself.

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Looking at my family's part, I understand that instead of feeling
protected by them and learning coping skills from them, I felt alone,
criticized, neglected, and isolated. In the mirror they held up, I did
not feel I fulfilled their expectations. I never received what I wanted
from them. They did not help me cope with my insecurity. They never
tried to understand what was really disturbing me or to help me
express my distress. I felt they preferred me not to share my emotions
and fears. I felt it was easier for them to ignore what I was experiencing.
They preferred to close their eyes to what was really starting to
develop.


And when I did sometimes succeed in seeing my own reflection in
my family's and society's mirror, what I saw was so different from
what others saw. Others thought me a sensitive, pretty, smart little
girl. Can you believe that they even thought I was a good girl? Others
never saw the sorrow, the pain, the fact that something was so very
wrong. No one could tell. No one else saw. So, how could I be
expected -- me, a little girl -- to see, to understand, and to change all
alone? I wanted to get out of it, but I wasn't sure what ‘it’ was, or
where and how to get out. And I couldn't cope alone, without help.


Within myself, I felt doubts, conflict, a lack of self-assurance, and
even evil. So, actually, there was no where I could feel good, and no
person who could help me find myself and my place in the world.
With that, the stage was set for developing depression, suicidal
behavior, and anorexia.

<font size="4"><b>5: Flowing with the River: Learning to Act Anorexic</b></font>
[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So, I was starting to flow with the river, and I had no strength to stop
it. Just as stones are carried along by the intense force of deep waters, I
felt myself to be helplessly and completely taken over by what was
happening. I felt unable to change, stop, or take responsibility for the
flow of events and experiences surrounding my development. That
flow was mighty, deep, and rapid -- much stronger than me. I helplessly
rushed onward with the current, unable to change the direction
of the tide, heading right for illness.


When I think about how my anorexia developed, I can see that its
foundations -- in the form of all my problematic thoughts and
emotions -- were already present during elementary school. But
gradually, during my adolescent years, they became more focused and
deeper, and eventually established themselves as problematic disorders.
The doubts that always accompanied me, as an integral part of
my life, turned into real pain. The process of suffering, of checking
and rechecking who I was and what was inside me, became harsh and
constant. I was incessantly unsure of who I was, what I was doing, and
whether it was right or wrong.


This nonstop process of digging deep into my body and soul was
not helpful, to say the least. My shyness and uneasiness turned into
anxiety, fear, and self-destructiveness. I was trying to hide from the
world and wished to remain unseen. The fears, the perfectionism, and
the wish to behave well and look good made me dread growing up
and resist the normal process of maturing and developing. Growing

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If I had to select a specific date for when my normal insecure
behavior turned into a sickness, I would pick my 14th birthday. It was
during the Passover holiday. I had expected my two best friends to
initiate a birthday celebration for me. I waited, but they didn't even
remember to congratulate me. I was very offended. I blamed myself
for being a dull, uninteresting person who was too fat and not
charming or attractive enough, which was why nobody really cared
about me. Reproaching myself, I thought that if I were a prettier,
smarter, or a better person, everything would probably be different.


It was after this birthday disappointment that the desire to change
my situation, change my social status, and make people want me intensified.
It was clear to me that the best way to achieve the social
success I wanted would be to change the way I looked. As a child, I
had always been chided for eating too many unhealthy and unnecessary
foods. I enjoyed eating junk food and sweets and didn't really
care for healthy, good food. At 5 feet 6 inches tall and 123 pounds, I
wasn't fat, but I believed that if I lost those extra 4 or 5 pounds, I
would look better without them. Always obsessed with what others
thought of me, I decided that the Passover school vacation was a good
time to make the change. I was occupied by thoughts of how
surprised everyone would be when I returned to school thinner after

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was surprised to see how easy it was for me to go on a diet. I was
always a person who tried to live up to the challenges I set for myself.
I started dieting without any hesitation. The first few pounds disappeared
easily. Giving up junk food didn't make me feel deprived. I
had no difficulty giving up sweets, and even fasting felt worthwhile,
although it wasn't easy. The pride of my success made me feel very
happy, and for me, feeling happy and successful, after all those years
of feeling worthless, was the most important part in the process of
dieting. However, reaching one goal usually meant that I immediately
wanted to start working on the next one. I could never settle for what
I already had. Each time I attained a goal, it was a signal for me that I
could do it, and that it wasn't as difficult as I used to think. Consequently,
I continued to diet, establishing new goal after goal. By
finding concrete goals that I could achieve, dieting also became
something that made me happy. In addition, when I stopped eating
junk food, my family was pleased. Suddenly, I felt my parents' unmistakable
approval, and I didn't have to doubt whether my behavior was
a good or a bad one. Seeing that my focus on dieting made me put my
sorrow and anxiety aside for a while, and that my change had pleased
my parents, I went on dieting even after the holiday ended. Actually, I
learned several things from this first stage of dieting:
<table>

By that time, dieting had slowly begun to become the central
target of my life, the happy part of it, the part in which I was succeeding.
I felt resolute, powerful, and proud. Success gave me the energy
to continue, but each time to a greater extreme. During summer
vacation, I decreased my food intake considerably. I thought my
parents didn't know. They seemed to be happy with me and didn't
seem to suspect anything. At least, they didn't say anything. I have no
idea whether they noticed my starvation or not. At the time, at 14
years of age, I wrote in my diary:

The summer vacation ended, and I entered high school. I was in a
very competitive class. My grades were excellent, but being good was
never enough for me. Even being the best was not good enough. I
always felt I could do better and should do better. Yet I was always
tense about success -- never sure whether I could cope with it. Anxiety,
stress, and insecurity were much more familiar companions. They
always stayed with me, and I knew they would never leave me. Thus,
instead of thinking about my studies and fearing them, it was natural
for me to occupy myself with dieting. Losing weight was a place I felt
secure in -- my ability to control myself and to overcome all temptation
-- and it kept me busy. In fact, soon I was obsessed.


My writings show that the issues of life and death were always in
my mind, even then. I remember that by the age of 14 I was already
very interested in death. I already knew then what I wanted my grave
to look like. I would imagine a big gravestone and often picture my
grave and funeral. I contemplated cemeteries often, although I wasn't
permitted to go to one. I did not fear dying. To the contrary, I was
curious, I wanted to die. I wondered what it was like. I decided to give
my body to science. As I became sicker, I started to talk more about
death. I saw it as a solution to my problems. I also became obsessive
about death. I was fascinated by death and I wanted to feel it. Even
today, I think of death very openly, often, and without any fear. I just
wish for my husband to be buried near me when the time comes.

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My massive involvement with death began when my cousin died.
She was ten years older than me, and I wasn't at all close to her. But I
admired her when she became sick with cancer and had to cope with
all the pain. She became a model for me -- of suffering, pain, and
coping. She used to be the one to cheer everyone up around her. Her
death was a turning point for me. Death became part of my life. I
thought of death, I wrote about death. I was not allowed to attend my
cousin's funeral, but I was very interested in it. Upon my cousin's
death, the family published a book about her. I could never let this
book out of my sight. I slept with it and took it everywhere. I was not
depressed. I saw death as a solution for problems, as a way to escape
all distress. I was expecting it. I wanted to learn firsthand what it
meant.


At that time, right before my 15th birthday, according to other
people, I was really thin. (I myself never felt thin enough.) I was 5 feet
6 inches tall and I already weighed about 101 pounds (after I lost lots
of weight during Passover and the summer vacation). I was obsessed,
anxious, and occupied with death.


It was my ninth grade teacher who first noticed the dramatic
change in me. She invited my parents to school for a talk, but they
never came. I think they were afraid to hear the truth so they
preferred to act as if they knew nothing. It might also be a part of
their tendency to hide the ‘dirty laundry’ from others. The teacher
was probably worried about me, so when my parents did not come to
her, she came to visit our home. I suppose the teacher had decided she
should warn my parents about my condition. She confronted them
and insisted that they listen to her, saying that she thought I was an
anorexic. This teacher was the first one to call my illness by its real
name and to recommend urgent therapy. However, my parents did not
want to see the truth, and they did not believe her. They thought she
was just too anxious, and that they knew me better. They said I had
always had problems with food, and had always vomited. They said I
was sensitive to food, and that losing weight was a normal behavior
for a child my age.

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At that point, I was already an expert at being anorexic. I was
already well experienced at hiding and throwing food away, forcing
myself to vomit, and deceiving my parents about what and when I ate.
At first, I tried to hide things from my parents. I used to furtively take
food that my parents expected me to eat and hide it in bags, which I
would later take outside and discard in the garbage bin. Then I started
forcing myself to vomit several times a day. I became obsessed with
vomiting. I soon found it very easy and effortless, and, once again, I
felt good about controlling myself. Here was another aim I had
achieved -- another challenge I had conquered -- and another success
of mind over body. I guess it was a lost cause from the start, because I
interpreted these deprivations and self-mutilations as achievements
and successes that made me happy. As my condition worsened,
instead of understanding the damage I was perpetrating, and trying
to change things, I viewed everything as a new goal or challenge that
offered a chance of feeling good about myself. It was very exciting for
me to constantly set up new goals and targets and to actually achieve
them, one by one. I loved this feeling of accomplishment. It gave me
strength. So, there I was, losing more and more weight, vomiting,
deceiving and hiding things from my parents -- and feeling satisfied.
Yet my satisfaction was never complete, because, whatever I did, I
always felt I had another mountain to climb. I always wanted
something more.


As can be seen, my drawing (illustration 5) at age 15 already
pointed to anorexia. I drew a female, but she looked male. There were
no signs of her gender. As in almost all of my other drawings, her face
was covered, this time by what seems to be the weight of the world.
Aptly, I entitled the picture <i>Burden of Life</i>. She was very thin, and I
focused much more on the details of the body than I had in the past,
portraying a more lifelike figure, rather than the earlier caricatures.
Yet, at the same time, there were fewer details in this picture. My
world had become emptier of details other than myself and my diet.
There were also fewer colors -- mainly black. There was a hint of
another female figure looking down from above. From heaven? A

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, the constant feeling of success, self-control, and accomplishment,
along with the desire to look good and thus gain friends, were
all factors in losing weight. Yet, I would say that my fears of growing
up comprised a major component. I had always feared growing up. It
felt like I was battling a kind of fight about who would be stronger --
me or my body. Not wanting my breasts to grow, I would bind my
breasts with a long scarf or a very tight shirt like they used to bind
girls’ feet in China, hoping to prevent them from developing. I
wanted to hide my maturing bosom and would avoid wearing a bra.

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I developed a comprehensive plan. How much I had to eat and
how much I should get rid of. How long I allotted myself to stay in
the bathroom in order to throw up and rid myself of all the food I'd
eaten. How much energy I had to exert to lose weight and how long I
should exercise. I used to run around my room in order to lose more
weight. I was preoccupied and obsessed with all these aspects of my
program. I enjoyed the sense of control I felt I had. Losing weight
kept me busy from the minute I opened my eyes in the morning until I
closed them at night.


Wanting my parents to stay in the dark as to what was going on, I
spent much time in my room, with a closed door. This probably made
it easier for my parents to ignore what was going on. They didn't
seem to notice, or at least acted as if they were unaware of my activities.
Surprisingly enough, despite my incessant preoccupation with
my body, I could still learn and succeed in school, which helped perpetuate
the pretense. One day, I did not lock the bathroom door, and
my mother came in while I was undressing. She was shocked. She said
she could see my bones. But still, she did nothing to force me out of
this situation. I saw my bones as well, but, unlike her, I was gladdened
by the sight. I wanted to feel my bones. I saw this as proof of my
success, and I was happy that I no longer had that ugly fat on me.
Strange as it sounds, I don't remember this time (the beginning of
anorexia) as a difficult period, as suffering. On the contrary, I felt
mostly power, success, and control -- a sense of joy in suffering.


It is interesting how vividly I remember the feeling of success from
losing weight, whereas I cannot recall the physical pain of starvation
at all. Yet I used to long for those moments where I could eat. I loved
and enjoyed eating. Food was something to enjoy, but I believed I

So anorexia was the outcome of my personal problems that were
always there and my social problems that led me to start dieting, as
well as my relationships with my family, which prevented them from
stopping me, confronting me with what was happening, and
demanding that I do something about it. The fact that my parents
kept ignoring the truth merely helped me continue quietly with what
I was doing. When they finally allowed themselves to admit there was
a problem, it was too late to stop me. My father thought I should be
hospitalized long before my mother did. They used to argue a lot, but
he would always acquiesce to her. My mother was too optimistic. She
believed in me and was afraid of harming me if she were to insist on
hospitalization. This, together with her tendency to hide things,
helped her to ignore the situation. If I had to paint my parents, I
would portray my mother in very bright colors and my father in dark
ones. Living between the white of my mother and the black of my
father, I was always in the gray. I never knew what or who was right.


At that time, at school, my classmates started calling me ‘half a
human being’. The teachers were worried, and the school nurse
insisted on weighing me every week. However, the school was
helpless to do anything more, due to my parents' lack of cooperation.
In contrast to my peers’, teachers’, and nurse's intentions, I enjoyed
and was reinforced by their attentions. I liked being called half a
human being. It served my purposes; I felt I was on the right track. I
was unaware of the danger of my situation. I liked achieving my aims
and being the center of attention. Thus, I faced a divided reaction
from others. On the one hand were concerned classmates, teachers,
and nurses, and on the other hand were my parents, who denied my
problems and didn't know how to cope with me. Throughout my
high school years, my parents continued to avoid the real problem,

Getting all these mixed messages from those around me was very
tiring. I felt helpless and exhausted. I could not find answers within.
As I've said earlier, my image in the mirror had always confused me
(and still does). The one that I saw then differed greatly from that seen
by others. I could never understand why other people didn't see me
the way I saw myself. It was like having two, completely different
figures. I was so disconcerted by that incongruent. I could never

My drawings from that time lay bare the suffering I was experiencing.
One drawing (illustration 6) was called <i>The Bird of the Soul</i>.
Usually while relating to the bird of the soul, one talks about wishes,
expectancies, or fantasies. For me, the bird was black, frightening,
scary. I hated what was inside me, I wanted to get rid of it. It looked
like a raven rather than a nice, small songbird. I think it's very meaningful
that, instead of drawing the bird inside the person, I drew the
person inside the bird. The bird was in control, while the person was
being controlled. The second drawing from that period (illustration
7) depicted a view from behind of a group of faceless people. It is

When I was a little over 1 5 years old, I started hearing voices. I
thought I was psychotic. Not far away from our home there was a psychiatric
hospital, where I was hospitalized long after. As children, we
always feared this place. Children used to point to it and say that it
was a place for crazy people. Crazy people for me were those who
heard strange voices, saw unreal figures, and said stupid things. So, as
I started hearing voices, I knew I was crazy. In treatment, Tammie
asked me about those voices. I explained to her that I used to hear an
internal voice telling me that I was evil, that I had to improve, that
things weren't going right. Afraid of what was happening to me by
then and especially afraid that I was a bad person, I found a great

I was suffering, but I resisted help. I knew I was in a bad state, but I
was angry and resentful. I couldn't understand why people were interfering
with what was going on between me and myself. It was not
as if I were harming my environment. So why was it other people's
business if I harmed myself? Didn't I have the freedom to make
decisions about my own life?


My drawings at that time were all black and depressive. In one, <i>The
Past</i>, a girl holding balloons can be seen from behind (illustration 8).
But, unlike the colorful balloons children usually play with, my
balloons were black. So were the trees, the sky, and the flying bird.
There was no happiness, no fun, no promise in my world. In a second
drawing (illustration 9), <i>The Gift</i>, I was expecting a sun, a tree, some
joy. However, the gift I received was black, small, insufficient, and
unhappy. I am not sure whether it was a flower or a dying butterfly,
but it was surely something meant to be alive and beautiful but
marred and aberrant. What kind of gifts could I have expected? There
was no joy in my future. Nothing to look forward to.

<font size="4"><b>6: Receiving the Diagnosis Yes, I Am an Anorexic: My First Experience in a Psychiatric Hospital</b></font>
[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I was a little over 15 years old and had already been anorexic
for almost two years, I still thought I could fool the whole world. Yet,
it came to a point where my parents could no longer close their eyes to
my state. The high school demanded that my parents act, and this
time insisted that my parents take me to therapy as a condition for my
continued school attendance. Reluctantly, facing no alternative,
wishing that I continue my studies, my parents agreed to take me to
therapy. I don't even remember that therapist or what we did together
-- probably nothing meaningful. I went for two sessions and refused
to continue.


For me, being anorexic was feeling power, my forces. Proving to
myself that I was strong and could control myself. Often, teachers and
nurses warned me that I could die, but I laughed at them. I did not
want to die. I only wanted to test my abilities. Touching death,
playing with it, without actually dying. Feeling my strength and
power to move between the two worlds of life and death. And,
perhaps (which is what others would probably say), getting the
attention I'd always sought. I felt vigorous and empowered by my
dieting and would not relinquish that sense of power without a fight.


My parents first became active at initiating my treatment when I
was less than 16 years old. It was then that they first began to insist
that I needed help. I was taken to the first hospital in a series of many

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At first I was very passive. I was there and listened, but I didn't take
part in the conversation. I hated those meetings and didn't want to be
there. I felt I did not really belong to that group of girls, some of
whom were in-patients. I knew that my weight-related behavior was
not right, but I didn't want to be changed, so I didn't cooperate. The
group lasted for an entire year until some of the girls were hospitalized
and some were referred to individual treatment. The group
became a real support system, but the support was not what the
therapists expected. It was not support for fighting our problems or
for trying to change ourselves and our behaviors. To the contrary, the
group became an arena for competition as to who could lose more
weight and who could best deceive the therapists. Between ourselves,
we avoided issues such as how old we were, how tall we were, or what
our lives looked like before the sickness. All we cared about was who
succeeded in weighing the least. Hence, instead of providing support
for overcoming our problems, this group supported us in overcoming
the therapists’ pressure to change. I remember coming to the group
and listening to one girl who had tried to commit suicide. After this
attempt, she was hospitalized. I envied her. I felt she had succeeded
more than I. She got more attention, she was stronger, she was braver
than I was. I wanted to be like her. This was my first actual thought of
really trying to harm myself.


I learned from the other girls in the group about different kinds of
medication I could use, both for emptying myself, and for trying to
commit suicide. I learned that I could mix different kinds of pills
together in order to kill myself. I started using all sorts of drugs but
none worked well, or maybe, unconsciously, I didn't take enough

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My eating patterns were very rigid. I was obsessed with my eating
and ate almost nothing, with the same regimen every day. It was like
some kind of a ritual ceremony. When I was forced to eat bread, I used
to cut it very thin so it was almost transparent. When my parents were
angry, and I had to compensate them by eating something, I would
eat three little beans. When my parents were relaxed and didn't
interfere, I didn't eat. I used to eat a yogurt in the morning, eat several
(3-5) beans for lunch, and drink water. When forced to eat a fruit, I
used to cut it and peel the skin in a way that left no flesh. I used to
drink water but colored it so my parents would think I was drinking
something good.


Even though I was not active in that group, those other girls from
that hospital, like the other girls from other hospitals I would meet
later on, became my real significant friends, my support group. They
were like me, and they could understand me, my behavior, and my
world -- unlike everyone else. Much of my writings and thinking, later
on in the future, were directed toward them and were about them.
They were my most significant others for a long time.


During all that time, I was still waiting for someone to take charge
and stop me, to put limits to my behavior, to prevent me from continuing
on that course. But no one did, and I continued flowing with the
river. I was too weak to take charge and try to stop myself. I was
playing a game between life and death.


My parents, peers, and therapists often told me what I should do,
how I should change, how I had to take charge of my life. But I was
the biggest expert at telling myself what I needed to do, although I
never seemed able to do what was necessary. This is also reflected in
my writing -- giving myself orders, trying to warn myself, and instructing
myself to avoid and reject others' suggestions:

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

No one ever saw my writings. Everyone -- my parents, my friends,
and even my therapists -- knew I was writing. But everyone looked at
them as the immature behavior of a young girl. No one ever thought
that my writings could reflect what I was experiencing or could help
in getting through to me. I could not tell them what I felt, I did not
know how to express my feelings. So my only outlet for expression
was in my writings. I wrote and wrote, covering tens, hundreds,

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In all my writings, there were signs that I was going the wrong
way. That something terrible might happen. The knowledge that I
should stop and avoid it, or the hope that someone would come and
help me. I felt lost but still had some hope. I felt I could not stop on
my own -- and waited for someone to stop me. The only productive
things I did during those years was writing.

Time passed, and group therapy was a failure. I didn't want to stay
in the group, so I left. It was obvious that something must be done
with me. My parents thought that individual therapy might be better
than group meetings. So, a short time after my 16th birthday, I started
individual therapy with a therapist from the same hospital. This
treatment did not help either. I did not cooperate. The therapist did
not understand me and concentrated mainly on trying to make me
eat. I think I must have been a challenge to that department, because

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have no deep emotions about that treatment, which suggests to
me that it wasn't really significant. Everything seemed static during
that treatment. I remember the eating disorder and the continuous
fighting at home, but not anything important in therapy. The sessions
were dull and boring, focusing on what I was feeling, going on and
on. Again and again, unsuccessfully trying to bring me to talk about
myself. I think the first person to start feeling depressed was my
therapist, from that psychiatrist department. I soon followed him. The
treatment, the unsuccessful treatment, pushed me to depression, to
the big black hole. I could no longer see any gray or white, or bright
things. I was in a terrible dark hole, and my therapist was in a black
empty hole, too. There was no way to get out. The only good thing
about this was that my future therapists would have something more
to treat. A new diagnosis -- my depression.


I was obsessed with emptiness, nothingness, and depression. I
turned this emptiness, these black holes that I felt, into my own philosophy
of life. The philosophy of emptiness and big holes. I
remember how, when I started therapy with Tammie and told her
about the big black holes, she said that she was not familiar with my
vocabulary and asked me to explain what these meant to me. That was
when I understood that the big empty hole had actually turned into a
big empty whole, coloring everything black to me. This black hole of
nothing, that had turned into a black whole of everything, started
later on (in therapy with Tammie) to change colors and size, and then
it disappeared, but that was long after.


So, I was in treatment that did not help, I continued being
anorexic, and then, I became really sick. Not sick in my mind but sick
in my body. I felt something in my breast. The same breast that I did
not want to let grow, and, when it did, something was wrong with it. I
didn't tell my parents, as I never shared things with them. I went alone
for a physical examination, and, as it turned out, I was right. I had a
lump and was referred for a surgical biopsy. I was very scared. Now, I

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When my parents found out, they forbade me from having the
operation. I can't understand why. Was it their way of putting things
under the rug, believing that if you don't talk about something, it
doesn't exist? Anyhow, I felt old enough and independent enough to
ignore them, and I decided to have the biopsy. I was a scared young
adolescent who made a huge decision alone and did it feeling lonely.
Angry at my parents, I did not want them to come with me to the
hospital or to visit me. I decided that if I were to be alone in this, I
would do everything alone. And if I died, then they would feel sorry
and regret everything.


I can't say that I didn't care about life, because I remember it was
important for me to go through with all the examinations and the
surgery to remove the lump. I guess it was a sign that I didn't completely
want to die. When someone really wants to die, she succeeds. I
guess I didn't want to die -I wanted to suffer and to punish myself.
When 1 was told that the lump was not malignant, I was very happy,
and, for the first time in a long while, I felt relaxed. I knew that my
time had not yet come. Even now, it is hard for me to think about
myself as a young girl going through all of that alone. I would not
want my children to be alone in such a situation, and it is hard for even
me to understand how I could have been brave and determined
enough to do that all by myself.


Of course, I didn't tell my therapist about any of these events, so
she could offer no support during that difficult ordeal. In fact, therapy
did nothing to help. Therapy would go on and on, in different
settings and with different therapists, for the next several years. Each
year pushed me deeper into the big hole I was in. Every year I
continued to feel there was no way out. They gave me lots of
diagnoses, strange labels for stigmatic clinical situations, and I started
to fit them. If they called me anorexic, I could be the best anorexic on
earth. I could use more medications and more sophisticated attempts

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, in a pattern that would repeat itself over the next years, my
out-patient treatment in the first hospital by different therapists terminated
It had achieved nothing. We had all become more
depressed, until they all finally understood the message and left me
alone. I came out of it knowing nothing at all about how to get better,
but I knew much more about how to deceive, hide, vomit, and lose
weight than I knew before I started. I even added some important information
to my repertoire: I had learned immensely about all sorts of
different medications and ways to commit suicide, and discovered
new and innovative ways to resist others' attempts to make me gain
weight.

<font size="4"><b>7: My First Hospitalization (Second Hospital), Or: Who is Stronger - The Illness or Me?</b></font>
[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My first hospitalization was at the age of 17 and a half. I was in the
middle of the last year of high school. It was just before graduating.
All my peers were in the process of preparing for being drafted into
their mandatory military service after graduation. It was clear that my
physical condition would prevent me from serving like the others. My
parents, together with my previous therapist, thought that I should be
hospitalized for a short while. They believed that being hospitalized
would help me solve my problems quickly in order to gain weight and
join the army like my peers. They believed that it would help me to be
under others' supervision, with regular meals served to me and the
company of people who expected me to eat. Thus, I encountered my
second hospital, a different one. In order to prevent a psychiatric
entry on my personal records, which could impair my future, my
previous therapist suggested that I be hospitalized in the children's
department of a general hospital, not in a psychiatric one.


Consequently, I ended up hospitalized for six weeks in the children's
department, where I received treatment by psychiatrists from
the psychiatric department. Yet, I was allowed to go home whenever
necessary in order to take my matriculation examinations at school. It
was like a game we all played. No one wanted to say I had a psychiatric
problem, so all of us (my parents, teachers, therapists, and myself)
acted as if I had a medical problem needing treatment. This ensured

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Being hospitalized in the children's department was actually fun. I
was among the oldest of the children there. I remember helping the
children and the parents in the hospital. I tried to keep the little kids
busy and happy. I felt as if I were in a summer camp. I used to go, play
with the children, have fun with them. Actually, I enjoyed their
company much more than I used to enjoy my own peers' company.
Being the oldest made me feel equal, worthy, good. I felt no competition.
I did not feel inferior, and I felt people (or actually, the children)
really liked me. There, I really felt I could act myself. It was an integral
part of me to want to take care of others and to help people. Even
then, I knew that whatever I would be doing in the future must
involve working with others who needed help. It was natural for me,
later on, to learn special education. On the other hand, I never could
help myself. I was constantly neglecting myself and my own needs.


In that hospitalization, I did not live in reality. It was like a game. I
woke up in the morning and went to school to take my examinations.
Afterwards, when it was time for my classmates to go home or to hang
around with peers, I went back to the hospital. It was like being in a
shelter, where no one could harm me. I felt protected. But actually, no
one really interfered in my life, and I could continue going on my
own self-endangering way.


As for my physical condition, nothing changed during those
weeks. The food in the hospital was terrible. The mere smell of food
in a public place made me sick, so it was ridiculous to even contemplate
the idea that, in that place, with that horrible food, I would
change and start gaining weight. As you can imagine, I lost more
weight. This time, I had become so skinny that even I stopped seeing
myself as too fat. But my obsession with losing weight was no longer
related to how I really looked or how much I weighed. My condition
didn't improve, and even worsened. I started feeling bored and saw
no reason to stay there any longer. I hated doctors and didn't believe
they could help. Against all advice, I took my things and left the

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was promised that the hospitalization would be short. I was
always good at talking and at persuading others. So, I succeeded in
convincing my parents and my therapists that there was no reason for
me to stay at that hospital. I believe they also wanted to get rid of me. I
was a strange creature, and they had no idea how to help me. So, I was
allowed to leave the hospital and go back home. They recommended
that I continue individual therapy as an out-patient of that department.
I agreed, mainly because I thought it was the only way out.


I came back home. My condition regressed more and more.
Physically, I lost more weight and it became very difficult for me to
eat. I was weak, and I did almost nothing. Emotionally, I was very
depressed. I started wishing to die. For the first time, it was not a game
anymore. I stopped feeling I was controlling things. The good feeling
of losing weight had changed. I was really suffering. I was no longer
attaining any good feelings out of my situation. I tried to avoid
thinking about myself. I spent my time dreaming, sometimes hallucinating.


Again, the only productive thing I did during that time was write.
My writings reflected my condition and started becoming obscure.
Even I myself cannot definitely explain what I meant. I started using
more and more third person and the masculine while writing about
myself. Mainly I debated with others my right to die. I was occupied
with death and dying. Death started looking like the best solution. I
used to think of my death. See my funeral. Long for the time when I
would no longer be alive. In my writings then, I referred to myself as
someone else -- he -- but he was actually me. Was that a clue to the fact
that I was trying to stop my sexual urges? Did I fear them? Or was it
just craziness? I have no idea.

My helplessness and depressed feelings were intensified by the fact
that none of my therapies had helped me. I had the feeling that now
my therapist at this second hospital had also given up and had no idea
how to treat me. I said I wanted to stop coming to sessions, and, consequently,
that treatment, like its predecessors, was terminated. I
stopped this last therapy without sorrow, feeling that it wasn't helpful
anyhow. Yet I began asking myself: If all those professionals gave up
on me, wasn't it a sign that I was in a very bad state? Was I a lost cause?


I persuaded my parents that the hospital was not for me, and they
suggested taking me to a psychologist in a private clinic while I lived
at home. I liked this idea more than the thought of being hospitalized
again, so I agreed to cooperate. I returned to live at home and started a
new therapy process.

<font size="4"><b>8: Is There Anyone Who Can Help Me?</b></font>
[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I started private therapy, I agreed to the psychologist's terms that
while under her treatment I would receive regular psychiatric
check-ups in a hospital (a different one). I had no choice, if I wanted
to avoid hospitalization. I guess that this condition that she established
stemmed not from her fear for my well-being, but rather from
her desire to cover her tracks while treating someone whose life was
at risk. This private treatment was, until Tammie, the longest therapy I
ever had. She treated me for several years, and from time to time used
to meet my parents as well. Most of the sessions focused on my family
background. Believe me, my family background could occupy many
therapies. Any therapist would appreciate finding such a rich history
of suffering and pain: the family's Holocaust survivors, history of
avoiding problematic areas, and need to present themselves as a nice,
good family and to hide their problems from others.


At that time, I was very ambivalent toward my parents. In a way, I
wanted to continue fighting with them. I thought they couldn't understand
me, and would never understand me. I felt they had deserted
me. I wanted them to worry, to understand that they didn't treat me
well. On the other hand, I wanted them to accept me and love me. I
wanted their protection and their help. Emotionally, I was still a child.
I desperately wanted to be able to see my parents as godlike figures, as
role models, as the ones who knew best, as the ultimate authority. I
was badly disappointed by the fact I could not see them that way. I
was angry at them for not fulfilling my wish. I was angry at myself,
for not being able to accept them as I thought I should. Thus, I was

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I don't think anyone can be helped by someone they don't like.
And I didn't like my therapist. I hated those sessions. We talked about
things, but I had this sensation of eating food that had already been
chewed, or walking in very thick mud. My therapist was incessantly
busy digging and digging, and that was so tedious. Maybe she was a
good therapist -- it's hard for me to tell. But she certainly was not a
creative one, in that she never seemed to try to change the style or the
way in which we worked. It was so predictable and so useless! How
could I be helped if I was bored -- with myself, my stories, and my
therapist? How could I change if I felt sick of just talking about it all
over and over again?


During the previous years, I often suffered from being sad,
anxious, and lonely as accompaniments to my weight loss. Now, I
could add clinical depression to my original problems. Yes, I could not
hide that fact: Now that my condition had deteriorated, my depression
had become severe. I think the sessions were probably very depressive
for my therapist as well. If I were a therapist, I would like to
treat people by teaching them how to be happy and find delight, not
how to become heavily involved with their sickness and sorrow. Also,
I believe that some humor or interesting discussion might have
helped at times. I know it is probably my depression that made me see
the world in black, and made me criticize my therapist. I don't want to
sound as if I blame my therapist for my condition. She certainly didn't
cause my problems. I am also sure that she had the best intentions.
However, I feel that she did not help me find a way out. We got
nowhere. I saw no way out of the blackness.


During that time, while I lived at home, my mother felt she had to
do something to take care of my eating problems. At first, she tried to
prepare my meals and watch me eat them, but we always ended up
arguing about what I was eating. So, my grandmother, the one to
whom I feel very close up to this day, offered to take responsibility for
my meals. I did not want to eat. However, my grandmother was the

<font size="4"><b>9: Meeting the Big Black Hole: My First Attempt to Commit Suicide (Third Hospital)</b></font>
[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was 18 years old. I had graduated high school with academic
success. I have no idea how I succeeded in taking all those matriculation
examinations. I was depressed, anxious, and very, very thin. I was
weak, tired, and felt cold even in the middle of the summer. Still,
preparing for those exams had been something productive to occupy
me over the last years. Now school was over, and the tests were over.
Because my condition had not improved after that brief hospitalization,
I was persuaded to postpone my army enlistment. I didn't want
to go, but I also didn't like the feeling of being different. All my classmates
were starting their army service. There I was, the only one who
could not be drafted. I stayed at home, doing nothing all day long,
every day, day after day. I had no more schoolwork to occupy me, no
friends, no fun, and no real aims to look forward to.


Suddenly, even more than before, my whole world seemed to be
black and empty, and I felt so lost in the dark. I started feeling as if
someone had emptied everything out that had been inside me. The
world around me also seemed to be empty and vague. It was then that
I started really seeing how my life was full of black holes. Some of
those holes were ones I sought while trying to commit suicide. Some
were those I felt I was thrown into by my therapists (all of them) by
their digging, digging, and searching for nonexistent answers.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Experiencing my first attempt to commit suicide was my first real
meeting with that black hole that had previously only been a
metaphor, and which continued to accompany me for a long while in
the future. It happened at the end of that summer after graduation. I
had been going to the hospital for weekly check-ups for the four
months since my discharge from the second hospital, and, because my
condition showed no improvement, the psychiatrists wanted to hospitalize
me again. The psychiatrists already understood that I might
try to commit suicide. (Like so many professionals' predictions for
me, this one came true as well, in another self-fulfilling prophecy.) But
this time, I refused to agree to be hospitalized. I was already 18 years
old; therefore, I had the legal right to decide for myself, and they did
not coerce me. So I stayed at home until that first suicide attempt. Did
I really want to die? Was I doing it because they were expecting me
to? Did I want to prove that I was not being helped? Was it a call for
help? Did I want to test my own strength, to see how far I could go?
Was it a game? I'm not sure that I took suicide seriously. I don't
believe that I considered all those explanations at the time.


I was at home alone during the days, and I started to collect all
kinds of pills. Many of them. One morning, as my mother left home
to go to work, I swallowed all of the pills at once. I don't think I
thought of death. Surrounded by the image of my classmates who
were living their lives as usual, serving their country in the army as all
18-year-olds are expected to do in Israel, and comparing them to
myself, I felt overwhelmingly alone, lonely, and helpless. I wanted
time out. I wanted to be unseen. To see another world. To take time
out and come back.


I took all those pills together. After a few minutes, I felt dizzy. I
went to lie down in bed. And then, I had a real black hole. I lost
contact with time. I had no idea where I was or what was going on. I
don't remember anything about that day. As I was told later on, my
mother came back home, and she thought I was asleep. For a long
time, she didn't do anything. Was that, again, her way of avoiding unpleasant
things? After a while she heard noises and entered the room.

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was still dizzy, and I felt very dry. I was receiving liquids intravenously
and was not forced to eat. I didn't want my parents to come
and see me there. My psychiatric assessment at the time granted me
with my third diagnosis: suicidal personality with depressive
patterns. As I came back to my senses and stopped feeling so dizzy, I
wrote this poem, referring to myself as ‘you’ and to everyone around
me in the normal world as ‘they’ -- my peers, my parents, my therapists,
the doctors:
<blockquote>

You are dreaming while they are doing, acting<br />
You are failing and they earn their success<br />

Once again, as I was moved to this third hospital, no one understood
me. As always, I turned to find solace in my writing. Writing
was a comfort. There, I could be myself and let out all my fears and
expectations. I was very dramatic, seeing the world as completely dichotomous,
probably like most adolescents but to a greater extreme.
When I read some of my writings now, I smile, but it was so serious
for me then. I took myself very seriously:
<blockquote>
<p>
Young child -- I miss you. Your sudden smile, the pain that is not
familiar to you, the constant attempt to run and compete with
yourself. The nonstop look for things you cannot afford. The
wish to be an absolute organism in the universe, who controls but
is not under control. You walk through life and life is dangerous
for you. You can't even see how dangerous it is. The vacuum that is
being created under your obscure figure, is the only one that
never leaves you. When did you lose your eyes, your ears? When
did you stop tasting and smelling and noticing every little change
around? When did you stop being smart and intelligent? Where
did this anger come from? This heightening fear? This rebellion
against life? The demand for meaning and answers? It seems, kid,
that these questions will occupy your mind and your soul
throughout all your life. There is no one but you who bears this
kind of burden of questions and solutions. You will awaken for
the day as if the light is so obscure. During the day you will be

escorted by your insides, drives, and internal world, by yourself.
As night comes, you feel as if you still haven't done enough. You
feel you have to look at your life and learn from it, and stop it. You
occupied yourself with checking and rechecking yourself again
and again. Enough. Choose, child, a flower. A flower without a
thorn that could cut your face. Choose, child, a flower. A flower
with a fragrance. And a fragrance that also has a taste. And a taste
that brings relaxation and a smile to your face, that can erase the
sadness in your eyes. Take a flower, kid. It's yours. From
childhood to adulthood. Take it and hold it tightly. Always here,
in the spring of your life. Be successful, stay well. Amen!

My feelings at that time, right after my attempt to commit suicide,
could also be demonstrated in my drawing (illustration 11) called <i>To
Fly Far Away</i>. I wanted to soar away from there, to cease existing as I
had. To stop the pain, to stop the sorrow. To fly away to a better place.
I am not sure if I meant to die, or to try to find a better world with
better understanding. Certainly I wished to be elsewhere, not in my
regular environment. As can be seen, I was depressed, but it was a
different kind of depression. I saw my world as bad, black, and
lacking meaning. But I believed another world existed. A better one,
where flowers, hope, and love could be found. I did not really want to
die. I wanted to live better. I was just not sure where or how I could
find this better world, and, sometimes, death seemed to be the
solution.


After I came back to my senses and was no longer groggy, I refused
to eat. As a result, I was fed through a nasal tube and gained a few
pounds. At that time, I was 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighed about 97
pounds, which was 26 pounds less than I was before I started dieting,
but a little more than I had been several weeks earlier. I was fed nasally

My parents were not allowed to visit me. It took my parents two
weeks before they asked for special permission to come and see me. I
stayed in that psychosomatic department of the general hospital for
four months. During that stay, I only visited home twice for a few
hours each time. Each time I went home, I collected pills, knives,
sharp objects, etc. to damage myself, so they decided to stop my home

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The staff were very nice to me. The supervisor, teachers, and nurses
were all trying to be understanding and to express affection, but I was
scared of the world. I wanted to change but was afraid of changing. I
wanted to let people in, felt I needed them, but couldn't. So, I built up
a high wall, and no one could get through. Everyone saw me as a troublemaker,
as someone who was fighting the world and trying to make
things difficult. Actually, I was a frightened little child, but no one
saw the scared little girl in me. All they saw was the manipulative
teenager who tricked them, was very dangerous, and could damage
the environment and herself. All the while, I was longing for
attention, warmth, love, and caring. I needed protection. I felt more
and more lonely. The worse my feelings became, the more I thought it
was a sign that I was really bad and that no one would ever be able to
help me. I blamed everyone for not giving me love and affection, but
the truth is that I don't think I let anyone love me. I was not in a
position to accept love. I did not think I was worthy of love. So, there I
was, wanting hugs and empathy but receiving pain-inducing needles
and injections, and remaining unable to enjoy or connect to the
warmth the staff expressed toward me.


Illustration 12, of faces, is called <i>The Shadows</i>. Everyone seemed
like a shadow to me -- meaning that they weren't real people to me. I
did not really feel them or relate to them. I was not aware of their particular
personalities or emotions. They all seemed the same. Each one
was just another face nearby, treating me, looking for me, ordering me
around.


I can still recall from those days my fear of the long dark corridors.
I was constantly being taken for another check-up, another examination.
I remember the endless corridor, with many suffering people on
its sides, shouting and yawning, people crying for help, and me
walking between nurses, powerless, as I was led to more and more examinations.
Neverending examinations.

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The department itself did not look like a hospital. We were allowed to
wear our own clothes, not hospital gowns, and the beds were regular
furniture, suiting teenagers. But the doors were locked, and one had
to buzz to open them. There was a painted line on the floor near the
head of the department's rooms, and we were not allowed to step over
it. We were three to four girls in a room. Those who were in better
condition could go out and spend an hour alone. But I was not
allowed to.


There was a fixed daily routine. School during the morning, group
session and therapy session during the afternoon, and family
meetings once or twice a week. I spent most of the time in the lobby
or in my room. The other girls were very different from me. There I

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There was a kind of competition between the girls. Everyone
wanted the others to recover, but for herself to stay thin and sick. The
worst thing was knowing that I was always being looked at. I was
never left alone, always under supervision. Everything I did was
being watched. It was hard to hide, vomit, or get rid of food. Still, I
succeeded in not gaining weight. I had no time for myself. And I was
concentrating too much on myself and my sickness. Living from one
minute to the next.


I was afraid that someone would take my pen and papers away. So,
I used to hide them, and draw and write secretly. In illustration 13, I
drew a tree, with people as a part of it. There are three people in it, or
around it. They look like monsters -- very thin monsters. That's how
we all looked. I called this drawing <i>The Tree of Life</i>, but it actually
looked like the tree of death.


I wrote a lot during that hospitalization. I was 18, hated my world,
and was looking for answers. This next piece of writing depicts the
split I felt inside me. ‘Me’, ‘her’, and ‘you’ all referred to myself.
Inside, I was split between the bad and good parts of me, between the
part that wanted to die and the one that wanted to live. I was not sure
who I was, and I was so confused:

I think the doctors were confused by me, as can be seen by the
various diagnoses I received. One thought me to be mainly anorexic,
another saw me as depressive personality, the third one thought I was
a borderline personality, and the fourth was impressed mainly by my
self-destructiveness and suicidal behavior. The fifth was sure I was
schizophrenic. If they could not agree on who I was, how could I, a
young girl, confused and powerless, know who I was? I think they

There in that hospital I was really sick. I felt sick, I acted sick, and,
as I felt I could lose no more weight, because there was nothing more
to lose, I became more and more confused. Perhaps the medication
contributed to my feeling of being remote and light-headed because I
was receiving so much. I started being mentally sick. I produced fears,
delusions, illusions, and self-destructive behavior. I say ‘produced’,
but I don't think I understood that I was doing it on purpose. This is
my understanding now of what happened then: in order to stay sick
and fit my diagnoses, in order to give the doctors the symptoms they
were seeking, I reported and showed them. When they asked if I
heard voices, I heard them. I really believed I was psychotic until
Tammie redefined those voices and helped me understand that it's
completely normal for people to talk to themselves. What I'd been
hearing was myself; it was my own voice and thoughts. There was
nobody I could talk to, so I talked with myself. It took me many years
to understand that the self-talk I experienced was not only very
normal but could even be an important coping skill rather than a
symptom of illness.


Hearing voices was a very simple solution to the split I felt inside.
Okay, so I was hearing voices. It was easier, in a way, to throw the
blame for my predicament onto others. Then it wouldn't be my responsibility;
it would be the fault of those voices who told me to do
things. When people were angry at me for not eating, for not socializing,
for trying to kill myself, I could say: ‘Hey, it's not my fault. I was
told to do that. I have to listen. I have to obey!’ The ‘he’ to which I

With the voices I heard, I also started visualizing. I saw images.
Those images were not clear, but they were surrounding me, ordering
me to be sick, and thus reinforcing my wish to behave as a sick
person, the way they expected me to. I think I was afraid to admit that
I didn't want to recover and that I wanted to die; therefore, I constructed
those voices and images to tell me to die. My fears magnified.
All of the fears that I would suffer from later on were beginning to
grow: fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of harming others,
fear of others looking at me, fears and more fears...


I saw myself as being in the middle of an intersection. Fearing to
take one direction, because it might be the very wrong one. Hesitating
between the different roads, and, therefore, staying stuck in the
middle where it was so dangerous, with all the cars coming toward me
at rapid speed. What characterized this period for me the most was
darkness, confusion, doubt, and terror.


With the fears, I started developing stomach aches. They didn't
know what was wrong with me and wanted to refer me for what was
to be my first-ever gynecological examination. I was frightened by
the idea that some doctor would check my female organs. I was
ashamed and scared, and I resisted the referral. They insisted that I go
to the gynecological department. I refused and cried. There was no
one to accompany me, reassure me, help me understand that it would

The regional child psychiatrist saw me then, and she told my
parents that they must take me immediately to be admitted into a psychiatric
hospital. If not, I would be hospitalized by force, under legal
order. It was Friday. I wanted to spend the weekend at home, but I was
not allowed. My parents, concerned that I might be taken by force,
rushed me up to the regional psychiatric hospital. They did not try to
question or rebel this decision. They just did it. It was not easy for
them. My mother cried. But they did it.

In all the movies and books, 18 years of age is a time for romance,
love, joy, parties, and laughs. I was a little more than 18 and was
spending my life in hospitals. This time, in the fourth hospital, I'd
ended up in a place for really crazy people. I understood at the time
that my parents were being compelled to admit me, under the threat
of hospitalization by force, by law, without asking my consent. But I
was still very angry. No one asked me what I wanted, what I needed,
where I thought I should be. I was sent over there like a package being
delivered.


All the way to the hospital we were quiet. No one could really
digest the situation. Much later, in family therapy with Tammie, we
talked about what it had been like for my parents to put me in that
place, how they had felt. It was terrible for them as well. They were
ashamed. They finally understood what a terrible state I was in, and
they were helpless. At the time, we never talked about it. They just
complied and said nothing. And I kept quiet, as always.


Not only was I excluded from the decision making, but I was also
kept in the dark as to what was going on and what to expect. I never
got any explanation about where I was going and what it would be
like there. Having never been to a psychiatric hospital before, all I
knew was gleaned from frightening movies and stories. And it ended
up that the hospital they sent me to was one of the worst. A facility for
chronic cases. Among professionals, it is considered one of the most
difficult institutions. It seems that no one had taken the time to

[p. <i>104</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00105&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The first image I recall is when we stopped the car at the entrance.
A man was being constrained. I was shocked, and so were my parents.
My feelings upon arrival are evident in my drawing (illustration 14)
called <i>A Dog's Life</i>. I drew a black dog under a tree, with a couple
bones nearby, and labeled it ‘Me’. I felt like a dog, I was being treated
like a dog, and I saw nothing good waiting for me in the future.


As Tammie and I were writing this part of the book today, my mother
called. She was minding my son, Or, while we were working. I asked

Getting back to that terrible psychiatric hospital, my parents
admitted me and left me there. I was left all alone in a room, and I was
really scared. I remember the small room, with one bed and a small
barred window that faced the nurses' room. I really felt like I was in
the cuckoo's nest. Here I was, a teenager, and the youngest patient in
that hospital was about ten years older than I was. Most of the people
there were my parents' and grandparents' age.


Typically, the more difficult my situation was, the more I used to
draw and write. I want to share here two drawings from that time:
<i>Isolation</i> and <i>The End</i>. In <i>Isolation</i> (illustration 15), I saw myself in a
closed room, sitting between two huge, frightening faces. Only

If I had to be assessed after that hospitalization, probably the best
diagnosis could be post-traumatic stress disorder. My experience

When I first arrived, the admitting psychiatrist read the report I'd
brought with me. He told me that he'd been asked to place me in a
closed, locked unit. He hesitated for a while and then said that he
could not do that to me. He said that he was sure I did not belong in

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I stayed at that hospital for a month. The most terrible month in
my life. The longest month I've ever experienced. The atmosphere
there was passive, depressive, and lifeless. There was no communication
between the people. Everyone was busy with themselves, and, if
they did talk, it was only to themselves. I could only communicate
with my parents and the nurses.


When I compared my situation to all those people's, I didn't know
if I should laugh or cry. They all moved very slowly, probably stoned
out on the psychiatric medication. They didn't talk clearly. Most of
them never knew another home. They were chronic patients who
were afraid to leave the hospital. They felt safe and protected there.
Compared to them, I was very vibrant, very healthy, and very happy.


This hospital was the second which replied to Tammie's request
for information. They diagnosed me as a borderline personality with
a secondary diagnosis of depression. I wasn't really treated at that
hospital. They held an occasional individual discussion with me.
They tried to find out more about my condition. Sometimes, I participated
in a group discussion in which I was not active. That was the
only hospital where I felt and acted healthy. I wasn't ready to play the
game anymore. There, I stopped comparing myself to normal people
in a normal environment. When I compared myself with those very
sick patients, who live inside closed doors, for the first time in my life,
I felt healthy. I continued taking the medication they prescribed, and I
started eating because I wanted out. I became really healthy and
normal there. The psychiatrist, as well, thought I was too normal to
stay there, and recommended that I leave the hospital. For once, we all
had the same evaluation of my condition.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Happier than ever, I left the hospital. Although coming back home
had been my fantasy during that long month, I found myself terrified
of returning home to be among normal people. In fact, I only stayed
home for two weeks. The dream had been a happy one while I was out
of my house. Once I came home, it wasn't that easy. I discovered that I
was afraid of being at home. At home, I started therapy with a new
therapist. This time, it was the head of the psychiatric youth department
in a different, fifth hospital. She tried to help me talk about my
problems and understand their sources. We were digging deep into
my past and my problems. It was like falling from the sky. After a
period of being happy, feeling strong and healthy, playing the normal
person in the previous hospital, I felt sick again. Always talking about
being sick, sick, sick.


Through therapy, she persuaded me to be hospitalized in her hospital's
youth department, believing that my situation was bad and I
needed intensive help to improve. I felt I no longer knew what was
good for me or what was true. I let her convince me. My parents were
not sure that hospitalization was the solution, but they didn't argue.
They let things happen without really interfering.


Being among normal people, being with my family, and needing
to cope with a normal life scared me. Comparing myself now with
normal people again made me feel sick once more. For the first time, I
was happy to be considered a psychiatric patient. I was happy to agree
to the hospitalization.

<font size="4"><b>11: Fifth Hospital: Will I Ever Be Normal?</b></font>
[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00111&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I cannot remember the first few days at this fifth hospital. It's as if
someone erased that first week from my memory.


In previous hospitalizations, my parents were prohibited from
staying with me during the first weeks. According to what they told
me later, this time they were asked to accompany me and remain with
me 24 hours a day for the first days to avoid the shock of being hospitalized
in a psychiatric hospital. It was the longest of my hospitalizations
-- I stayed there for eight months.


In the department, there were adolescents aged 12 to 22, boys and
girls together. What characterized those kids most of all was the
feeling of being miserable and the atmosphere of sickness. No one
could see a light at the end of the tunnel. It had the feeling of some
chronic, static disease. Nothing changing, nothing optimistic -- as if
we were asked to accept the idea of being sick and learn to live with it.
I felt again that I'd received a license to be sick and needed to behave
like a sick person. If I felt healthy in the previous hospital, I certainly
felt sick in this one. There was no outside world, no healthy society --
we were completely disconnected from the real world. Inside was
sickness and just sickness. Maybe this was the reason why I stayed
there for such a long time. Eight months is almost a whole year. A year
that, outside, could be full of joy, happiness, youthful experiences, excitement.
But in that place, there was nothing. The time came when I
no longer believed that I would ever be able to live outside the
hospital, without treatment, without being taking care of.

The staff were angry at me for not socializing with the other
youths. They blamed me for isolating myself and for keeping myself
busy with my writing. They used to take away my papers and pen. I
hid little pieces of paper, and I would write at night, in the dark, and
hide my work under the mattress:

Fear of life.. .anxiety.. .fear of death.. . I was just a lonely person.
In my heart, my broken heart. With pain, and sorrow. Listen to the
voice, the voice which is quiet now, a far away memory... a dream,
half hoping, half looking for promises...


I met death. He was wearing a strange face.


He came suddenly, without warning. He came and asked me to
join him.. .I knew death was the loss of power...maybe nothing
was left of me.. .I know that if I cried I'd be left behind... I had to
run, I had no strength...


I've always been turned from a friend into an enemy. Did I not
fight enough? I knew coping should be wonderful. I had no
strength for that. If I learn to live, when treatment comes to an
end.. .will I get a diploma for being able to cope with life -- with
all its power? Its strength?


It is so difficult... it hurts.. .I think I.. do I want to live? Maybe I
do.. .please do not leav me, I will try.. .I want to learn more.

So, all along, my closest friend continued to be paper. My writings
and drawings were the only outlet for me to actually reveal my real
language and style, without criticism. So, I wrote and wrote, and by
covering hundreds of pages I gained some sense of relief. In the
following, I wrote about my hatred for that place, its white walls, its
smell of medications:
<blockquote>

Each day at that hospital looked like the one before, and I fell into
the routine. After a while, when I could not stand the intravenous
liquids anymore, I agreed to eat. At mealtime, I had to eat because we
were under close supervision, and there was no way of getting rid of
the food. After breakfast, we were required to participate in a recreational
activity. For months, I refused to participate and would not go
until I was physically forced. This may seem ironic, because I was a
very creative person who loved painting, sculpture, and writing. But

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000969436-I00116&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I lost track of time. When you live in a closed world with no challenges,
no changes, and no demands, you soon get used to it. You start
being instead of living, existing instead of fighting. I felt I was riding
a train that was racing downhill. My condition, at least my emotional
condition, constantly deteriorated. When I think about it now, I can't
understand how I did nothing during every day, day after day.


During all that time, I had no connections with friends outside of
the hospital. Most of my age group was in the army, and I had never
been a very social type outside. I had only one friend from my high
school with whom I maintained close contact (and we are still friends
today). Hence, my social interactions revolved around the other
patients.


Some of the other youngsters' problems really touched me and,
like always, I tried to help them. I always could help others more than
I could help myself. I used to listen and give them support. The ones I
could relate to were youngsters who didn't have a chronic condition
but who'd been put there temporarily, like me. As with me, if you saw
them on the outside, you'd think they were normal (if there is such a
thing). One boy was hospitalized because of post-traumatic stress
disorder, which he'd developed while in the army. He was a very
nice-looking person, but was always quiet and never spoke with the
others. He was miserable, and I had the feeling that he didn't deserve
the suffering he was experiencing. He looked like a regular guy on
the street who'd been put there by a streak of bad luck. One girl had
an obsessive-compulsive disorder and was particularly anxious.
Another girl who had a reactive depression after her mother's death

The worst experience of all, back then, was being isolated. I
suffered this degradation twice. Once, when I refused to eat and tried
to harm myself, I was constrained to a bed in an isolated room, and
they gave me a nasal tube to get some nourishment into me. For two
days, I was unable to move -- my hands, legs, and head were tied
down. The only way the staff could hear me was if I yelled, but I'm
not the type of person who shouts. I wasn't allowed to get down to go
the bathroom, but I couldn't stand the idea of emptying myself in
bed. I couldn't relax and was under so much stress that they gave me
an injection to calm me down. It mostly made me sleep. Time halted.
When I was more alert, I counted the minutes until I'd be free.


I remember when they let my parents come and visit me in
isolation. My mother came in and was shocked and angry. She cried,
but she never talked to me -- she couldn't share her feelings or support
me. I couldn't stand her being there. Immediately after they released
the constraints, I wrote:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The flowers in my room died<br />
Sad, and lonely<br />
No light reaches them<br />
Not even a ray of sun<br />
They are lonely<br />
Entirely alone<br />
They are just like me<br />
Almost the same --<br />
Almost dead<br />
And by the end -- me too<br />

It came to a point where I felt that I could no longer live in
hospitals. It seemed to me that I was never really living. I was being
treated, I was on medication, I used to fight with those who wanted to
save me -- but I had no time to live. I used to think it was not up to me

Yet it was hard for me to leave life, and I drew this dramatically in
<i>Farewell</i> (illustration 18) from the same time. This drawing depicted a
second female figure, waving and saying goodbye to the dead figure
lying there. I am unsure if I was portraying the two different parts
within me (one who still wanted to live and the other who wished for
death), or if the parting figure was someone else. This time, the
figures have faces.


Friday nights were the worst. I knew, that outside, somewhere in
the world, people were having their Friday night, Sabbath eve meal
together. Youngsters my age were getting ready to go out, to have fun.
Whereas, for me, it was just like any other endless, monotonous day:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Friday evening<br />
It is twilight<br />
Another week has passed and gone<br />
Many views, signs, and expectations have passed between the two eyes<br />
And he never stops seeing, anxious, doubly fearing<br />
Everything has gone, passed, gone away<br />
As if suddenly over<br />
Sitting there alone, so pure, so innocent<br />
Only a kid, God, only a kid!<br />
No, he is not winning. He keeps losing. Losing life, losing the world<br />
You let him stay alive -- but inside he is dead<br />
You gave him the opportunity to laugh, but he is so sad<br />
You never hit him, but he is in such pain<br />
Maybe for others it is easy, but for him -- it is so heavy<br />
And sad, sorry God, for only He cries<br />
A rain of tears, a storm of emotions, a lightning of hopes,<br />
Thunderstorm of facts<br />
They all come together in that darkness<br />
Inside storm, very personal. Against all realities. Refusing to explode.<br />
It is not time yet.<br />
One movement joins the music that is finished for others and<br />
Remains his for eternity, only his<br />
The kid wants, tries, is punished, and tries again, fights, but fails<br />
Keeps trying, keeps walking</i>

<i>The kid loves, but doesn't touch life<br />
Disappointed by reality, he doesn't know<br />
He is crying again<br />
God, do You hear?<br />
God, do You see?<br />
God, do You feel?<br />
Why don't You answer?<br />
Why do You leave him there alone with all those questions?<br />
Why he is so lonely, with no answers?<br />
Why is he so frightened by emotions?<br />
Why he is overwhelmed with facts?<br />
Why did You pick a flower that is already dead?<br />
Why, God? Why?<br />
Friday evening<br />
It is late<br />
The feeling starts and never ends<br />
This is how it is for him -- the kid<br />
Only a kid</i>.

I did not see any use for those treatments or for the unit activities. I
had to participate in drama therapy and music therapy, but I felt so
distant from them. These media didn't speak to me. I couldn't relate.
Most of those hours passed with me resistant and quiet. When I did
not act in drama because I hated it (but maybe the truth is that,
actually, I was afraid of letting others learn about my emotions), it was
translated as resistance because of my difficult situation, my suicidal
or borderline personality. When I refused to sing because I hated my
voice, it was interpreted as another sign of my poor condition.


Except for my assigned nurse therapist, not one member of the
staff ever tried to get involved with the things that I liked: writing,
reading, and drawing. None of them tried to get inside my world, my
preferences. I had to conform to theirs. So, I was my own therapist. I
wrote and wrote like someone possessed. They knew I was writing
and drawing, but no one wanted to see all my work, and they even
asked me to take my drawings away. My writing was considered to be
another sign of my inability to interact with others, so eventually they
took my pen and papers. But I hid little pieces of crayon and small bits
of paper, and I continued writing. If only someone had read what I
wrote, they would have discovered that everything was there laid out

<i>You are trying to punish him with what you are doing<br />
But nothing happens to him. Only to you<br />
Look, he will not die, just you<br />
You are angry at him, but he is yours, with you, part of you<br />
He lives, he sleeps, he is healthy, he exists<br />
And you are disappearing, going, and vanishing<br />
You, and just you<br />
Don't do it for yourself if you do not believe enough<br />
Just do it for those you care for<br />
And even if you say you don't know that, inside you,<br />
In your soul, there is some creature. Yes, for him<br />
Now, it will be for him, and later on, for you<br />
All this way isn't worth it<br />
With all the ladders to climb, there are so many to take you down<br />
You go up, but actually go down. Facing the wrong direction<br />
You still have life to live. It's only the beginning<br />
Even though you see the end -- you still have life<br />
Give your life the same chance you have been asking from them<br />
Maybe, it will be good again<br />
On that path you take, there will be no one to experience the good<br />
Since you will not be any longer<br />
You deserve happiness. You deserve satisfaction. You deserve a friend<br />
Yes, you deserve, you deserve<br />
If you give it a chance, it might come one of these days<br />
Do not prevent yourself from living. Do not take life away from
yourself<br />
They want you, although you hate them. You are angry at the whole
world<br />
But could it be that the world loves you?...<br />
To fight means to win, to compete is to lose<br />
You need the power, the strength, the ability, but most of all the
decision<br />
To start here and now, together or alone,<br />
To take the rest of you, the rest of me forever</i>

My assigned nurse sometimes read my writings, and she was more
optimistic than the others about my future. She was the only one who
actually discussed the future with me. She told me of someone who
had been in my situation and had come out of it. This nurse was the
only one I went to see after I got married, and I brought her a photograph
from my wedding.


During this period of my hospitalization, I wrote and wrote as if I
was obsessed and afraid of not having enough time to tell all the
things I had to. Later on, when therapy with Tammie came to a point
where I felt normal and happy, I gave her two presents: a 500-page
book, which was the collection of all my writings, and a big collage of
the little note-sized drawings I had made during that lengthy hospitalization.
But at that time in the hospital, I still felt miserable, and I
wrote:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The pain is hers -- deep deep inside<br />
It is with her, with all of her- the sorrow<br />
It is in her, inside of her- logic<br />
It is with her -- along the way -- memory<br />
The shining white, the tearing black,<br />
The intimidating red<br />
A spot, a spot, a spot for life<br />
He failed and never got up. Before his day came<br />
He is so young, so young, a cloud<br />
She turns -- around and around -- the thought<br />
She is there, not here -- the tear<br />
She is burning, never stops -- the soul<br />
Our part is so small, nothing, but exists<br />
The wish to stand behind, to support, to hear<br />
To give a hand, to give a shoulder, to listen<br />
To take her far away, to give her a smile<br />
In the taste, in the taste of life</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
In those days, writing was the main aim of my life. Everything I did
was in order to return to my room, take my papers and pen from their
hiding place, and write what I felt during that day. Everything else

<i>You gave me a hand but I never took it<br />
You try to give me, but I could not believe<br />
You opened a little window which I closed<br />
You took me closer to you, but I went away, to the corner<br />

But I kept walking in the same place, not moving<br />
I stepped over the problem<br />

It doesn't mean this is the end<br />

It was more than seven months after my arrival at this hospital that I
began to spend most of my time trying to persuade my parents to get
me discharged. My parents were convinced that I was dangerous to
myself and others, so they refused. Only after I warned them that I
would die if I stayed there -- that I would kill myself- did they agree
to let me come home. The psychiatrist did not want to discharge me,
but I left, eight months after I had arrived. I left the hospital in
January of 1994. I was almost 20 years old.


At home, my mother was very anxious, not letting me out of her
sight. I had to go with her everywhere -- even to the bathroom. After
two weeks, I couldn't stand being outside the hospital any longer, and
I wanted to go back. Life, and especially life so close to my mother,

Then, one day, I decided that enough was enough. I threw away all
my medications. I stopped taking them, and I decided to try and live
again. And I started to live. I don't know what helped me. Under medication,
I felt big, heavy, and low. Without the drugs, I felt like a new
person. I could see the world around me. Being in the real world, I
was full of fears, but I could also see some challenges:
<blockquote>

And an angel who is sent away from paradise<br />
And an angel being sent away<br />
I am afraid of those who look above and behind<br />
God is there, looking at all He has created<br />
Hey, Mom, look<br />
Give me some strength, power,<br />

I still have my dog and find a lot in animals that people lack.
Honesty, trustworthiness, friendliness. I do not always find all that in
people. My dog is so helpful, so attuned to me. When I used to argue
with my husband, she would have diarrhea and vomit. She couldn't
stand it. She was also the one to tell me when the time came for me to
go to the hospital to give birth to Or. She paced back and forth all that
night. She keeps a nightly vigil under Or's bed, and only awakens if I
feel bad, and then she wakes up my husband. Only when I am okay
does she return to sleep.


Now that I teach a special education class, I hope to bring animals
into the class as a mode of helping problematic children express

I completed my last drawing, <i>Me and You</i> (illustration 20), after I
returned home from the hospital and decided that I could actually
stay at home. I had decided never again to return to a hospital. In this
drawing, it was the first time I could think of myself as with someone.
And this someone was a male figure. Not only wasn't this drawing depressive
anymore, but, also, one can see for the first time the sex of the
figures. A man and a woman. They were not too thin, and they were

And now I'll stop relating my own narrative, and let Tammie
present things from her viewpoint, in the next part of this book. Later,
in Part III, I'll add my comments and thoughts related specifically to
what she'll describe.
