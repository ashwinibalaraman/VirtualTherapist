BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	Is that your woman?
<b>PT:</b>	No, that's my mom.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh.  You're going to see her tonight?
<b>PT:</b>	Huh?
<b>DR:</b>	You're going to see her tonight?  Do you see her often?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, every day.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How's she doing?
<b>PT:</b>	She's doing good.  She's doing a lot better [INAUDIBLE].  A whole lot better.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How's his health been?  I heard he's still laid up.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, he's uh, he [INAUDIBLE] self.
<b>DR:</b>	He does?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I guess after years of drinking, yeah.  It's like his body's just crashing.  For a little while he was not drinking.
<b>DR:</b>	But he still can't really, he can't drive or—
<b>PT:</b>	No, he can't drive, he can't walk, he can't do anything so he kind of sits there in the house and feels bad for himself.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	No, not too much.
<b>PT:</b>	No, not really.
<b>DR:</b>	Still kind of angry with him?
<b>PT:</b>	No, not too much.  I don't think I'm angry.  I don't care.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	That's pretty strong.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I don't know what the right word is for it.
<b>DR:</b>	You said, uh, don't care.  Is it more indifferent?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sorry?
<b>DR:</b>	More indifferent?
<b>PT:</b>	Like how?
<b>DR:</b>	That means it doesn't matter, it could be this or that, what he does.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I mean, I'm just holding a grudge, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, if he started drinking you wouldn't necessarily be surprised.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, not at all.
<b>DR:</b>	And you wouldn't be all that upset.
<b>PT:</b>	No, wouldn't care.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's kind of, that's pretty indifferent.  It's a way to protect yourself, too, though [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't get caught up in it.  Because you know, if you started drinking again, your mother would be devastated.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It would probably upset [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Yep.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] bother me at all, just might piss me off.  So you know I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I guess you heard about your dad's seizure.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I heard that.
<b>DR:</b>	And [NAME OTHER] being there.  He handled that well.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, he did.
<b>DR:</b>	That's impressive.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes, I was surprised.  I was surprised.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your mood been?
<b>PT:</b>	Good.
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] doing okay?
<b>PT:</b>	Good.
<b>DR:</b>	Work?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Paying attention and concentrating pretty good?
<b>PT:</b>	Trying to.
<b>DR:</b>	Bit of a problem?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm sorry.
<b>DR:</b>	Bit of a problem at times?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Not really, not really honestly.
<b>DR:</b>	No?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm in the office half the day and out of the office the other half.  It's not all, like half a day in the office, like broken up the day—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's not too bad.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're not having to just—
<b>PT:</b>	Sitting there all damn—
<b>DR:</b>	That would be bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that would be bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Kind of like take you back to school when you had to do your homework.  Good to have breaks.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's why I didn't do my homework.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, had you done your homework.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that's true but I just did enough to get by with B's and C's.
<b>DR:</b>	So, at your work, if you having to do a bunch of paperwork, you can do it for a while and then it gets a bit old, you can get up and go do something different?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, just different aspects of it—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	I can do like that.  I can't even do [INAUDIBLE].  You have to sit there all day.  There's different areas of the computer and stuff in the office I can do.
<b>DR:</b>	Makes it more interesting?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, it's not so monotonous.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you able to get back to the stuff that you left?
<b>PT:</b>	It's like [INAUDIBLE].  Honestly, it kind of works out itself.  Take a break, start working on something different.  I'm only like 15 or 20 minutes then I go back and finish it, you know.  Start thinking what I was, I don't know, [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	At what point do you know it's okay to take on something else?  Because of those things will end.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Then you take on another something.
<b>PT:</b>	I just know whenever it's done, you know—
<b>DR:</b>	Then there's more.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Just do what I got to do to get it all done.
<b>DR:</b>	So you kind of go from this to this to this to that and then do they all kind of come, they all finish up kind of at the same time or different times?
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.
<b>DR:</b>	They do?
<b>PT:</b>	Sometimes.
<b>DR:</b>	That's a good feeling isn't it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, completing things.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And knowing it's right.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  How do you do at the end of the day, having a lot of loose ends, though, uncompleted things, tasks.
<b>PT:</b>	Um—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you able to let it go and come back and start again next day?
<b>PT:</b>	I try.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Lots of stuff, it's not like some long task.  It's something that takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Most of the time, it's done about between 30, 45 minutes.  I just find something little to do.
<b>DR:</b>	So, what are you doing in the evenings these days?
<b>PT:</b>	Uh, hang out with my girlfriend.  Played poker this past Sunday and won almost $200.  It was just awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
<b>PT:</b>	It was a really good feeling.  Especially on this one hand, it was me and my best friend, and uh, I had a king and queen and he had a queen 4 and we were playing Texas Hold'em you know how to play?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, on the clock, it was queen, king 4 hit.  I'm like hell yeah, 2 pair.  I needed this 2 pair.  And then another queen hit.  I was like I got a full house.  And I had the highest full house and, uh, so I kind of just baited the deck and kept betting in real small.  I didn't bet big and, uh, figured if he had something, it'd be stupid.  I don't know why, I don't know.  It's just like intuition or something.  Play small, play small.  And then he went all in.  I was like what?
<b>DR:</b>	Called you out.
<b>PT:</b>	So I won $60 in that 1 hand.  It was pretty awesome.
<b>DR:</b>	And he's still your friend, huh?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Me and him been best friends since I was [AGE].  He's done that to me before, yeah, so.
<b>DR:</b>	You were just getting your money back.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  So, I bought these sunglasses.  Not bad.
<b>DR:</b>	Drinking much?
<b>PT:</b>	No, shit no.
<b>DR:</b>	How are you doing with the, um, kind of ruminations, you know, stops over and over?
<b>PT:</b>	Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	Is it?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I haven't been taking medicine.  Um, I usually try and catch it myself.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you do then, you catch it you see it [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm like wow, what am I doing and just like that, it's over.  It's kind of like it's almost under control.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] just cut off.
<b>DR:</b>	So you recognize it sooner?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I was thinking, I mean, I might start taking the medicine again.  I mean, I feel like I'm fine, then.  I feel, I don't really have moments where my anxiety or something overcomes me.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just, I don't know.  I don't think I'm ready to be off completely yet.
<b>DR:</b>	When did you stop?
<b>PT:</b>	About a month ago.
<b>DR:</b>	It takes a while.  How much were you taking?  You were taking how many, then?
<b>PT:</b>	Three.
<b>DR:</b>	Three of them?  It'll take up to a month for it all to get out of your system.  It's a long acting drug, so you may start finding, uh, even now it starts to get a little worse.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I've had some days where I [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm happy with that.
<b>DR:</b>	That's wonderful.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So you can recognize these things when they're kind of creeping in your brain and put a stop to it and move on.
<b>PT:</b>	Or when it starts, like the, the initial thought—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm just like what?  Boom, it's over.
<b>DR:</b>	That pretty much is what cognitive behavioral therapy is just saying not to it when these thoughts come in and substitution of other ideas and—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, but my dreams have been a lot more, uh, suspicious since I've been coming off, stop taking the medicine.  Really interactive.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Like, I don't know.  I, I think I invented something kind of neat.  Pretty cool.
<b>DR:</b>	You invented something in your dreams?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I know, it was like right before I go to bed, or like when I lay down, the point where I close my eyes and when I fall asleep is when I'm most active, my mind, that's—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I don't know, I was thinking like at my house, my air conditioning unit, the vent that's beside my bed, I don't know, I was just thinking like how can I make this better?  But I just came up with this idea instead of having the vent there, like make a vent that can fit in that corner of the wall.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	It can just go the length of the wall, kind of blend in.
<b>DR:</b>	What would be the purpose?
<b>PT:</b>	You can cool the room better that way?
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I think so.  If you sat in that one spot, you'd have it the length of the wall.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And then you could, the way I was thinking about designing it is have like 4 or 5 different tubes with almost like a vacuum head, like just a little square thing that fits into the corner and stack them one on top of each other long ways.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And have a tube for each and have it hooked up on almost like a computer to where it could control the amount of air flow per room, you know like if you cut one of the vents off using the computer.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And just, uh, I don't know, and there's other ideas when I'm just falling off, it was pretty neat.  I thought it was a pretty good idea.  Especially for these rich people.  Because I see a lot of real expensive houses out in [DEIDENTIFIED] doing what I do.  And they all have like waterless, um, [INAUDIBLE] water heaters and you know all the state of the art shit.  I kind of figure it would be more eco friendly because it could cool the room—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, cool the room faster and, yeah, save energy that way.  I don't know, just an idea.  One of the many.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I was going to say, you have a lot of ideas.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, write them down so you don't lose track of them.
<b>PT:</b>	I thought of this idea, it was about 3 or 4 years ago, this was for my senior project [INAUDIBLE] too hard for me to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.
<b>PT:</b>	It was too much computer programming and all this other, it was just crazy.  And my idea was to take like, um, whenever you get home, you take your cell phone and you put it on a dock and it's linked to all your other house phones, so you only have one service, and when your cell phone rings, it rings throughout your house to every phone in the house.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And, uh, I still have the paper so I'm like, [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	So I was like damn it.
<b>DR:</b>	A good idea is one thing, but how do you get it to market?  How do you—
<b>PT:</b>	Right, that's the thing.  It's hard to find the, to get all the frequencies right and you get the things to, something to answer, to pick up the phone—
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And just punch out the codes and just some shit you got to know how to do.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	It's not like you just hard wire everything.  But that air conditioning thing is [INAUDIBLE].  I was actually thinking about maybe if I get the board, going to Lowe's and making like a little thing, prototype, just to see if it worked well.  I think it would.  I really do.  Because it wouldn't take so long, like in the winter time, it wouldn't take so long for the heat to hit the ceiling, cool down, you know?
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And in the winter time, cut the vents and cut the top vents off and then it'll just come out the lower duct [INAUDIBLE] level.  I thought that was, I don't know, it beats the hell out of [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	Hum, hum, hum.  You frustrated very much?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah, lately I have been frustrated.
<b>DR:</b>	What about?
<b>PT:</b>	Just little shit, man, just little shit.  Like, I don't know man, I just, just little things that aggravate me.  I just, I mean I don't express it.  I'm not like, my head can't explain what I'm thinking and why I'm aggravated is wrong, I shouldn't be feeling this way, but I do and I'll just like walk it off or just ignore it.
<b>DR:</b>	That's easier to do than it had been?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What happens then?  What do, you respond just to walk away?
<b>PT:</b>	I just kind of like, just kind of like roll it off my shoulder.  I just let it go.  Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] here lately.  And my girlfriend said she's been proud of me a lot.  I need my space.  Except the fact that we hang out too much, I enjoy her company, but it's like she's just always right here.  And that's my little area.  Like I want to sit in the recliner and she wants to sit on my lap.  Damn, I just want to relax.  Shit.
<b>DR:</b>	Too much is too much.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Lay down on the damn couch, watch TV, shit.  But I don't say anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I don't want to hurt her feelings.  She's, sometimes I'll say something.  She's like okay.  Other times it's like, you know, she's not really bothering me too much.  It's good to have somebody there.  She's a good girl.  She's going to school to be a, uh, nurse anesthetist.  Uh, this is a different girlfriend.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, I thought we were still, uh—
<b>PT:</b>	No, different girl.
<b>DR:</b>	As of when?
<b>PT:</b>	About a month and a half ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, right after I saw you last time.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	What happened to the last one?
<b>PT:</b>	It just, uh, it didn't work out.
<b>DR:</b>	And where did you meet the new one?
<b>PT:</b>	Playing cards actually.
<b>DR:</b>	She just came over somebody's house and—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And where does she play?
<b>PT:</b>	Hum?
<b>DR:</b>	Does she play?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's good.  She's good.  Oh, you got to see this picture.  That's my gun.  Here, you can turn it this way.  That's my momma.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's, that's me.  That's [NAME OTHER], [NAME OTHER].  Yeah, we were taking a car off a trailer and when we put it on the back of this Durango hopped way up and when we took it off, it didn't ass out.  I was trying to take a picture but it didn't do it, so.  And, uh, [DEIDENTIFIED], it was just a random road we saw.  That's my best friend.  That's my other best friend.  That's her.
<b>DR:</b>	Where's this at?
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, that's just in the car somewhere around.
<b>DR:</b>	Cute.  How old?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE].  And she's smart.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Which is good.  Hint, hint, I'm stupid people.
<b>DR:</b>	Did she graduate yet?
<b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  She's got 2 more years.
<b>DR:</b>	No, I mean from the nursing part of it?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't think so.  I don't believe so.  She said she's got 2 more years, then she's got her bachelor's and then 2 more years.
<b>DR:</b>	She already has her bachelor's?
<b>PT:</b>	No, she's got 2 more years until she's got that.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay, then she's got a couple years after that, too.  About 4 years I guess.
<b>PT:</b>	She's thinking she might go to get her doctorate.  She's got a long time.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	So, I'm pretty, it's kind of, it's kind of a blessing sometimes that she has this school stuff, you know, because she's at home studying and I'm at home sleeping or—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And she don't even know.
<b>DR:</b>	You don't have to be constantly attending to her needs.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, right.  That's pretty good.
<b>DR:</b>	Tell me again, you were saying that you needed to be on the medicine because you're not quite ready to come off.  What makes you think you're not?
<b>PT:</b>	A feeling.  It's not anything that's happening, it's just logically I feel I'm not ready, so, it's not really a thought or anything, it's just your body tells you when you need to do something, you know what I'm saying?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I do.
<b>PT:</b>	Your body or your mind tells you self remedies for sickness and things [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And my body's just telling I'm not ready.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're going to listen to it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes.  Ever since I've been listening to my initial intuition and doing things that have been, you know, don't second guess myself, things have been better.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Like I won poker, I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	There you go.
<b>PT:</b>	I've been winning poker, but it's like I just won my money back and then I was out, you know?  Or I'll win a couple bucks, or I'll win like $80 and I'll lose it or I'll take my best friend's money and I give it back to it.  And it's nothing.  This time I didn't.  See like, when he takes my money, he don't give it back.  I'm just making a lot more money than he does, though, that's why I did it for a while, but I'm like yeah, yeah, you're a [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Ha, ha, ha.
<b>PT:</b>	I think I lost that night.
<b>DR:</b>	It's nice to see you more self confident, too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Then he [INAUDIBLE].  It's just good to hang out with the crowd of people that she hangs out because they're good people.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	And they're not so judgmental.  They're not, they're real nice  people.  It's good to hang out with a crowd like that.  It's been a long time, to actually see that there are a lot of people that are good, yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	So, don't get too jaded, too discouraged.
<b>PT:</b>	No, Huh-uh.  And I think [INAUDIBLE] whatever, who cares any more.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I hope you don't.
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] keep me around.  Yeah, they don't bug me too much.
<b>DR:</b>	They seem okay.  And I'm glad you're going back on the medicine for a while.  It's got to be helpful for you.
<b>PT:</b>	And another reason I might need it too is because I'm trying to quit smoking and, you know, some days, I'll go 2 or 3 days without having a single cigarette and then I'll have 1 cigarette and then I'll 2 or 3 more days without a cigarette and then I'll have 1 cigarette.  It's just like I don't know.  Sometimes my nerves just get shot and then it's like oh, my gosh.  I just want a cigarette.  But I'll ignore it, or try to, think it might help.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, try not to take it personal.
<b>PT:</b>	Like for a while there, it was just like I didn't care.  I was just like ah, it's bullshit.  [INAUDIBLE].  Now it's like uh, it's going to kill me.  I might as well stop.  So, I'm trying.  It's hard.
<b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b>	Pain in the ass.
<b>DR:</b>	Well worth it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, and [NAME OTHER]'s kind of a motivation for it, too, because she's, not with her, I can't smoke.  She would crawl up my ass.  So, don't really like that shit, though.  [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Hum?
<b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	You going back to work now?
<b>PT:</b>	No.  I'm probably going to go home and see how my dad's doing, see if he needs anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Why?
<b>PT:</b>	I do that sometimes.  Just check on him.  Make sure he hasn't fallen on his face.
<b>DR:</b>	Because you don't care?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know.  I'm a good person, I guess.
<b>DR:</b>	I understand that, you know, intellectually you kind of want to distance yourself so you don't get burned, but, uh, you know, it's your dad.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And he really stepped up and helped you get treatment because I'm sure if it weren't for you letting him have it and laying it out for him, he wouldn't have gotten it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]—
<b>DR:</b>	So you need it here.  That's what it took.
<b>PT:</b>	My dad's been saying that shit for a long time, so I guess it just took a combination of the two.
<b>DR:</b>	I bet you said it in a different way this time, though.  Or he was just ready to hear it.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	It happens.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I'm sure, laying in the garage with your leg, this big, broken in half.
<b>DR:</b>	Makes you wonder, maybe I do have a problem?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, for 6 hours, makes you sober up kind of quick.  Shit.  He won't even go down those stairs now.  As long as if he could, he won't go downstairs.  He wanted me to hook the TV up in the garage yesterday.  I was like fuck you.  You hook it up.  You want it there, you hook it up.
<b>DR:</b>	All righty, good.
<b>PT:</b>	The only reason he did that is because he's cold all the time when [INAUDIBLE], which he kind of is because he's always wearing a sweatshirt—
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Sweatpants.
<b>DR:</b>	Has he lost a bunch of weight?
<b>PT:</b>	I mean, I'm like, I had a pair of shorts, I had my boxers on and I'm sweating because I didn't [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Well—
<b>PT:</b>	My mom actually cut the air down [INAUDIBLE].  I said get over it.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, call if you need anything here, [PATIENT NAME].  I appreciate you coming by.  I'm glad your brother's doing well, too.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	He seems to be doing a lot better.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, oh, yeah.  I think my dad, you know, him having to take care of my dad—
<b>DR:</b>	Has been a good thing.  Yeah, not bad.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, take care of yourself.
<b>PT:</b>	Yes sir—
<b>DR:</b>	What's the girl's name?
<b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	[NAME OTHER].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's going to be a member of [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b>	Good.
