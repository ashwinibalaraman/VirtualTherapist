<b>Sunday, March 4</b>

Situation remains exactly as described above. It now is exactly
the same as the most terrible weeks and months of March-June,
1971; no specific external pressures are exerted, and yet the
whole metabolism is in the grip of total collapse.

The alternatives or options available may be listed below:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. Go back to Keele and continue with the prescribed
medication. An unsatisfactory solution in my view (although, in
the short-term, clearly the most attractive), since it holds, at the
very best, the prospect of a very abnormal existence, as was the
case during the academic session '71-'72 at the university-while
Parnate was being prescribed.
</p>
<p>
(This way means that the illness is merely placed in cold
storage and the fundamental and plaguing difficulties continue
with only partial remedies available to relieve some of the terrible
sufferings.)
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. Attempt the possibility outlined above (March 3). If the
Fairfield authorities will not agree to such an "experiment,"
then it will be imperative to obtain the cooperation of other
hospital facilities for this purpose. This avenue, though it means
considerable suffering in the short-term, seems to hold the most
constructive and realistic chances of a cure--ultimately. At the
time of writing these brief notes, my mind hurts terribly--so much
that a constant, continuing thudding is felt at my temples. Unbearable
tensions and anxieties are a constant companion.
</p>
<p>
At this moment, the thought of death is a beautiful one; the
prospect of peace and eternal release in another life is a very
attractive one indeed. Nonetheless, I am adamantly determined to
resist such temptations, as this totally unnecessary suffering must
have a cause--and, an end. I am absolutely determined to see it
through and so outlive this cancer.
