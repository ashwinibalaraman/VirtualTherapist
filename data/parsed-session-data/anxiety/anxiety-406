I came to my island home to prepare the draft of a book on teachers, learners and their mutualtransaction.
I, a woman of fifty, wife of over thirty years, mother of two adolescent sons, came
alone for the purpose of getting a piece of work done, undisturbed and rapidly, as demands of job
and family only granted me that much time.


When I planned my island home, I designed it with infinite care as a place for us to discharge the
tensions of frantic careers, to be together closely but comfortably, to relate leisurely, and to
experience the tremendous beauty of this place, in the sight and sound of the sea.


In designing the cabin, I put my working place at a corner window, hoping that my writing would
flow easily from this combination of beauty and fulfillment.

As my feverish activity of writing my book pushed me along, I found I had also launched on a
personal journey through the experience of change. This is the journal of my journey into inner
experience, away from my pressing activity at my cognitive task. As I worked to convey general
meaning to others, my journey brought personal meaning to me.


I was aware that creating this journal belongs to that part of my fabric that deals with changes:
the slow ongoing changes of daily experience as well as the more sudden lifestage changes of
becoming part of new goals, of different living, and of a body changing with advancing years.


This is a journal of this experience as I became simultaneously immersed in my <i>doing:</i> the writing
of my book, and in my <i>being:</i> this is a record of this journey into my experience of change; a
voyage into my dreams and projections, among the magic external patterns of a personal reality.


I am sharing it as a document of self-exploration at a period in personal time that is often seen as
one of decay and undoing, but which I experience as another time of becoming, just as childhood,
adolescence, or my middle-years. Neither do I feel fulfilled or complete, nor do I despair of further
becoming and growing.


Although being alone is one of the themes of this encounter, I have been fulfilled by those close to
me-without them, my search would have been empty and my travel futile; with them I can strive,
and hope, and become.

<i>Watchman, what of the night?<br />
Did you forget the gaudily painted ships<br />
which sail through the hours of stillness<br />
meaning to reach the East of the Sun before dawn?<br />
What of the piercing scream intended to massacre silence<br />
though it returneth the calm, poignant in utter defeat?<br />
What of the fountains that play as the night<br />
enveloping you with tufts of existence,<br />
what of the fog that sneaks over town,<br />
what of the agony that cannot be broken,<br />
what of the dawn which exorcised the spirits--<br />
Watchman, what of</i> this <i>night?</i>

Arrival<br />
June 20


There was sustained excitement about my coming. I always approach coming to this island with
curiously expectant joy--akin to the expectancy of creating life--knowing it will be new, but how
will it be?


Midsummer-night was coming.


As a child I had captured the mysterious Dionysian trembling of approaching midsummer-night on the
Isle of Sylt.


The long, long day, the sparse twilight night, the strong perfume of suddenly erupted wildflowers,
gave this mystery, promise, and a flavor of the orgiastic occult. I was embarking on an orgy of work,
but at a place I loved and among sights that nourish me.


When I got to my house it was late--still, I unpacked a loaded car, put my two boxes of books in
order, went down to the shore to announce myself to the waves and a strange week of work and
play ensued--hot with ardor, clear with perceptiveness, full of feeling, and of ancient images that I
permitted entry.

Midsummer-night<br />
June 21


I just finished moving in. Moving in is a very personal activity--each place one puts things represents
a personal choice. Actually, I cannot remember really moving in for me like this ever before. For
the first time I am experiencing a divine egotism at fifty, in this home that I designed.


In building this beach home, I had spent much time in deciding on the angle the house should cut
into the view to capture both land and sea, and also into as many aspects of the sea as could be
contained, as each aspect of land and sea sends a different message throughout the hours of the day
and the turns of the tides. There are long vistas of open water, pulling the eye to the horizon,
evoking the awe of vastness and the call of distant discovery; there are the views into the bush--the
verdant growth of groundcover and trees, spelling out landlife, cover to man and beast, and the
mystery of the protecting forest; there are views onto land, across small bays of water, a retelling of
man&apos;s yearning for shores beyond the seas--even the view of a small house, perched near a cliff,
signalling nearness and availability of another human. Thus, this beach house mirrors the vistas of
many worlds. To lend choice allowing for moods of expansion and moods of withdrawal, to express
feelings of cave-safety and feelings of openness, the house was made open with large windows on
one side, but has a solid corner of dark, protecting, warm cedar wall where one can feel out of the
elements, inside a human-size space--when this is the desired mood.

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00010&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The wide open sea is also the roadway for ferries--they plow their way through low and high
waters, through calm and through storms to connect people with people, towns with towns, islands
with other islands, the small ones in the sea and the large ones we call continents.


We can see the ferries move by from our bed. There is a calm inexorability about their seemingly
magic motion as they glide past. Strange beasts in search of distant places. The ferries cross right
here; they pass each other on their appointed journey, they do not seem to pause to acknowledge
their kind, as if driven by an external program that allows no deviation. In this sense, while these
ferries evoke an awareness of being connected, their task is connecting; they also exude an aura
of distance--the estrangement from fraternization in the face of an externally imposed task.

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00011&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For these past three days I have been anxious, anxious about how this aloneness would be; would
I feel abandoned, would it trigger unknown ghosts to come and push on me, would it bring peace or
creativity? I don&apos;t know yet, all I know is that I am curiously happy and myself right now.


Before sitting down I visited the beach, trying to recall all the small things that make up its
intimate topography; many features remain from last year; others though, have shifted and changed,
telescoping geology into a year&apos;s time--as the restless sea is changing the land, as the restless wind
is changing the land, and as life in its infinite strength at the edge of the ocean proliferates in
living and dying: in living growth and the castoff, past growth of skeletons.


This beach, which I know so well, is a small strip of land. With my appreciative eyes I have paced
it off so many times and it tells me about knowing or perhaps about the <i>almost</i> knowing: as what
one knows is changing constantly while we the observers are changing, too. Thus, knowing is an
approximation, and not too proximate at best.


By chance I had picked up a book, <i>Poetry of the</i> Forties, in Vancouver; as I opened it last night,
my gaze fell on a Stephen Spender poem. Written in 1942, it echoes what I was from 1939 to
1949:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>I am cold as a cold world alone<br />
Voyaging through space without faith or aim<br />
And no Star whose rays point to a Cross to believe in,<br />
And an endless, empty need to atone</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<i>I am cold as a cold world alone<br />
Voyaging through space without faith or aim<br />
And no Star whose rays point to a Cross to believe in,<br />
And an endless, empty need to atone</i>.

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Stephen Spender, too, was part of my growing-up experience of the Thirties and Forties: the
waiting for the Cataclysm, the pacifist who had to affirm war, the experience of raw violence and
massacre. Of course, there were activists, and little can I excuse my dormancy. I am saddened at
having wasted so much life, but this cannot be undone, nor would it have been different with me,
I think, were it all to replay. The world is no better to explain my emergence from my shell, but
somehow I must have become stronger and also more fatalistic at the same time.


When I arrived on our beach, I immediately started picking things up; there was no planning,
just gathering--might it be that the more eager gatherers had an evolutionary advantage which still
drives us to beachcombing and collecting?


Coming here was a strange trip. There were so many little but important questions that arose:
should I plan a planned or unplanned day? It does not really matter; the question, though, is a
question of trust in my ability to resist entropy--can I go native without letting go of achievement?
How well I can understand the mistrust of straight society of the hippie--when even I seem to be
mistrusting my own drive so much!


I unloaded the car last night. In the past H. would do most of the carrying--I don&apos;t like carrying
so I don&apos;t do it well--but I did and did it well without backstrain and I felt strong. This morning I
started pumping, 75 pumps, I felt them, but I felt more of a "man." Even a woman needs to feel
she can do something towards physical survival. The strength in the muscle is strength for life.

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All of these are unknowns to the middle-class housewife; we live too far from the seashore that
is the frontier of life; there is some comfort to this sheltered existence but the question, "Am I able
to do a little toward my survival?" must rest close to consciousness, and even a Petit-Trianon-like
setting of almost makebelieve closeness to nature raises this question.


These past four days with my younger son were delightful. I had not been with him alone since we
roomed together when he was born. He is still the quiet, deliberate, pensive human being he was
then; now added to this is a marvelous wit, a gentle intelligence, and a great power of observation.


When I was his age I was confounded at the unfeelingness and lack of human learning of adults.
He seems to feel the same. We were at a White Front restaurant and watched the poor waiter-boys
hustling frantically almost like Chaplin in <i>City Lights;</i> I said something about how it struck me
in what horrible ways most men have to sell their lifetime to eat, the thought not new, but the
intensity and presence enormous. He looked at me with pity for having this thought so obvious but
so late in life. But then I, too, feel that so much living has not been lived and so much being has
not been.

9:45 p.m.


My husband and my older son called--the lonesome pioneer with a telephone!--but it was good to
talk with them and hear them. I am not equipped to be a recluse and I dread to think I might
become garrulous from loneliness like the person who drove North with us these 900 miles.


I walked on the beach once more; the promised Pacific storm had sent waves against our beach--a
distant storm sent its advance guard. Now there was more lead color in the sky and the gulls seeme
busier feeding and pushing their young around. Do we push our young faster when change
threatens?


It is now 24 hours since I came to the island. I feel that I walk more slowly, breathe more slowly,
and also some of my drivenness is leaving me. This is always so on the island--where it comes from
the sea, the nostalgia, negative ions, I don&apos;t know, but I slow down and turn inward and it seems
that I suddenly have more to draw on. This may be imagination but it calms and assures, to feel
this slowing, of having a day of nothing much planned, of beach and view, of slow-motion time, of
the changes in light, in tides, and of moving closer to our aquatic pasts.

<i>My life is as a shell reposed on shore--<br />
open to skies and wind and to the waves<br />
that wash across a land which ever braves<br />
the tides that follow those that came before</i>.


<i>My life is as the gulls whose quest is more<br />
than the desire to live and be: it craves<br />
the open seas to conquer, and enslaves<br />
the self in searches of its molten core</i>.


<i>My life is as the sea that ebbs and flows<br />
following distant moons. The universe afar<br />
creates my passions in whose raging throes</i>


<i>my being opens--thrust ajar<br />
to change and changing, as the ceaseless foes<br />
of stagnant deaths encircle me: a nascent, flaming star</i>.

Sunday, June 22<br />
Morning


I awoke with the thought that I had to look back today. It is overcast and a bit chilly and I set
myself a fire; the wood is getting low in the house and I have to plan to gather and split kindling
and collect bark from the sea. This small having to care for one&apos;s needs feels good! Why? It is a
sign we care for ourselves, it is a validation that we can do something about our condition.


Someone at the Western Psychological Association meeting stated that Japanese students are more
concerned with problems of affiliation while North American students are about autonomy. Is this
the Westernness, is that what identity and autonomy are about, such as my current question about
being alone?


When treating a young patient at the height of his schizophrenic episode, his fears were fears of
having to merge with his mother, of losing his self, or else of having to destroy himself to escape
such fusion. When I helped him to get away on his seemingly aimless summer hitchhike, I felt that
he had only two ways to go, to separate by leaving emotionally, which he could only do by physical
removal, or to fuse and have to die. He went away and now is whole and autonomous. Do the
Japanese, if they indeed look at this differently, have the same adolescent phantasies and fears about
love and sexual union? Could it be indeed that some humans could feel they are part of a colony
and feel cast out or amputated when they are not a small part of a multiple human whole?

I have pumped water now, gathered wood, and relearned that one must carry a heavy load on the
upslope side, reviewed some of Piaget&apos;s writings, and am now ready to write. I gathered some
beautiful rocks and glass on the beach and wondered about their finiteness, about the finiteness of
even the most infinite--and how individuality, even in a rock, is part of this finiteness. In teaching,
we need a balance of finites and generalizations so that the learner will neither be constrained
by concreteness nor lose the essence of reality in overgeneralization.

Sunday evening


It has been a good day; I wrote the chapter on epigenesis, walked, gathered, thought, stayed on my
diet (very hard alone), and had company: The Millers breezed in with four children. I must have
looked startled as Jane asked whether she was disturbing. I did resent the intrusion then and asked
to be permitted to finish writing my paragraph and then enjoyed them for a couple of hours.
They are people who live their values and are bright and concerned.


I am now reading about cognitive growth--so far the book goes along o.k.--how I wish it would be
a few months from now and I could read it and tell how it is. At this moment I am unable to judge.


Lightning started at dusk over the mainland after this muggy afternoon. Sheets and streaks of
lightning alternated in different locations at the horizon. Lightning is terror-striking in its elemental,
unbridled display. So wild and undisciplined that even common fear recedes and a sense of
awesome wonder takes over. There is a finality to lightning, more so than to rain; rain seems to
come down to follow further fates on the ground; lightning appears to be spent as it hits, resolved
as it mates with the ground. There is a sense of fait accompli of the ultimate closure that syncopates
the time of this event. Even distant lightning punctuates the night.


It is drizzling now; the sky fought giving up its moisture all day. When the first drops finally fell it
seemed like a slow victory.

Monday, June 23


It is raining and the earth is resting from its drought. Carl Jung says that Dionysian rites present
rain as the ultimate earth and sky consummation; I, too, experience rain as some final rite.


Last night I was about to mail a letter when I suddenly had to write a sonnet. It was there, all of
it--in less than five minutes it had typed itself--it must have been waiting to be written for the past
two days. The images were the ones I had been playing with--the combination and meter, a rigorous
strophe, had not entered my conscious thought. How odd this preconscious thought, out of reach
but obviously closely available. How can one know oneself if even such action is obscure?


I am finding, too, that as I write along a spate of references emerge and I remember now that the
collection of books I brought came not from a planned list but from a seemingly blind reaching.
Alas, as I write, I find the needed quotations in an instant, so obviously there is some plan that
this book must be part of.


I went to town on the ferry to run errands; as always, it took longer than expected but I was able
to enjoy it; I even did some exploring by following my nose, then enjoying coming out in the right
spots.

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps I am role-playing with myself-trying on parts-to find what all there is to me. Somehow it
came to me that I have a need to like myself and approve, and perhaps I am looking for parts that
can be liked.


Roles-one must try out roles; being alone makes this more possible. So often we just think of roles
as roles of behaving overtly: but we also have to try out feelings for size and how we can cope
with them. There is an exhibitionism in this, but it depends how publicly one has to exhibit.


My last errand in town though, provided a terrifying surprise. I picked up my photographs. I had
taken them many weeks ago and had almost forgotten what they were. As I opened the envelope a
few very happy faces appeared, a beautiful portrait of B., a good and helpful coworker and friend,
a group showing three members of one of my working team in comfortable conversation and then, a
clear, too clear portrait of G. A moment in time captured, unintentionally, as by a voyeur, he seemed
to peer out in despair, coupled with anger, a clenched jaw, wide-open eyes, and a tense drawn rigidity
in the muscles of the face and neck. Yes, I had known that G. had struggled with anger and depression:
still, the full magnitude had been hidden in his ready smile, quick wit, determination to do his
utmost best on a job, and his need to hide his true feelings.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Never had I experienced such an indirect revelation and I had to wonder whether I, too, had
dissembled, as G. had--perhaps to spare myself, perhaps to honor his message of not wishing to
share, or perhaps some of both.


It is difficult to know what to do with such information--yet accessible and on open record; the
shock of recognition of having unwittingly entered a private, secret world!

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

6:00 p.m.


Eric and Jane are having me over to dinner. I am glad since I am dried out, wrung out, spent from
having written or probably having tried to write coherently for so many hours. I am so curious how
it will read. It is brightening up and I will need a walk later. Case-notes came for review from my
student psychologists. I reviewed them, appalled at how uninvolved, browniepointish, term-paperish
they were. I resented the time spent on annotation and somehow getting in touch with the writer&apos;s
thought processes and needs.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

10:00 p.m.


The sun sets now across from my desk. I walked on the beach to Preacher&apos;s Point, right at the edge
of the lapping tide. How much like boys playing chicken, but safely. But still this kind of
counterphobic play increases safety and feelings of power--the safety of manhood, the safety of
survival. I could laugh at myself and still feel strong. How much does simulation really help? Where
is the boundary between practice and useless pretending?


The woman who bought the acreage behind us showed up at Jane&apos;s; she will talk to me about the
parcel that has the glen and the former vegetable garden. I so long to have more land here, it means
so much. I guess as the forces of fascism increase I need this symbol of refuge. I wish I could be
a woman&apos;s woman. Even tonight, as much as I like Jane, and she came to me with trust, somehow
I can communicate so much better with men. I am trying to change.

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The last of the red in the sky now fades, a wind came up and the sea is rising. Nature is so beautiful
and present; can we still feel our biological part of it, or is all this a maudlin copying of secondhand
experiences? <i>I</i> think it is of nature like gravity and orgasm, and the closed-in tenseness before storms,
like opening up to Spring and huddling against the advent of Fall. I reread Jung&apos;s <i>Man and His
Symbols</i> last night and while I still find a good deal of obscurantism in him, I agree with this need
to go back to primal experiences and the need to search for themes and themebearers in our soul.


As I have this world before me, I recall another night when I had left H. in Vancouver, after a Spring
that foretold change.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I left H. in Vancouver. All this spring I had felt a sense of impending change-both a hope and a
fear; a feeling that something was about to happen, but not knowing what this may be-what this
may have to be; <i>have</i> to be as there appeared to be no choice. A fear of leaving without return
filled me, a fear that no one would be ready to call out after me, gripped my waking and resting
dreams, until I found my quest heard. I do not know whether I was to depart on this necessary
journey regardless of this knowledge or whether I could have waited and delayed starting, until I
knew that I would be actively searched for. I started!


As I sat at this beach I remembered another time when we were separated. The night before H. left
was noisy with surf, light of moon and strangely taut. An exceptionally high tide was chewing at
the land, teasing enormous logs as if they were twiglets. making the land strain against the water, in
tired defiance. The sun had set in flaming immolation, pausing at the horizon as if reluctant to
abandon this part of the earth even for one night.


We made love intensely, trying to make it last like the sun pausing at the horizon.

<i>Stay that hand at the bellrope!<br />
As we embrace--keep us requestless;<br />
neither the Angelas nor the Matins<br />
disturb our silence!</i>


<i>Stay the intrusive whining of jets<br />
and the querulous chatter of railroads!<br />
As we embrace--keep space undefined<br />
so neither the lightyear nor the millimicron<br />
shall be encroaching upon us!</i>


<i>Stay the clocks that spell change:<br />
check the carbon atom&apos;s inexorable decay<br />
and arrest the compelling rounds of this universe!<br />

Much later that night, when the faint Northern luminescence remained in the far sky, I shared an
oddly compelling phantasy with H: I imagined that the sun had suddenly reversed its course and
was about to re-arise in the West, having given off this luminescence to announce his second coming
for this day. And I asked H. how he would feel. Without any hesitation he answered that he
would turn himself around in bed. Even in his joking, he sounded so self-assured that this could put
the miracle in order, so sure this magic could master his world. This sounded like sacrilege,
though by its very strangeness it told me something about my place, a place where miracles are
possible, are allowed to happen, where I need not, indeed can not change, what is taking place,
where I have become but a vesse for experience.

Now it is early morning and the sun is rising to the East. I sit on the beach and let this tidal basin
in front of me be my world. It is my world--the world that lies before me; about as large as any
world that I can truly encompass--the extent of my sensory world--as far as the eye and the ear
can reach but still beyond touch, taste, or smell, and thus not even entirely accessible to complete
sensory cross-validation. Beyond such a world where immediate experience has ended, either our
memory or the experience of others must provide us the message, thereby voiding our own
involvement in its existence. Such experiences--the more mediate and remote--will invite projection
and conjecture and be changed by the intrusion of the myths of the race and of the person.


I must remain within my world, meditate on what unity there may be within this immediacy. This
world is my life-past, present, and future. If I wish to use my life to nourish me so that I may
nourish others, I must allow myself to be in this world more complete and less managing and more
receiving and less sending.


I must see and hear my world at all points of the compass, where each point is both a beginning
and an ending, a birth and a death, both hope and despair.

<i>Meditation on the East</i>


Where I am, the East is over the mountain, deep in the bush-the dense green forest with
man-high groundcover, tall evergreens and alders of second growth. It is a lush-looking
forest on first glance, looking immutable and strong, seeming to swallow the earth with
its vigor. Yet, this forest rests on a very thin layer of soil to which each rootlet
tenaciously clings to gain moisture, food, and a foothold to steady it to the storms.


Each tall tree, while appearing strong and autonomous, depends on its companions to
protect it from the full impact of the wind, to help keep moisture, to make more soil to
nourish them both. Nothing is alone in this forest--it is an enormous joined organism of
interdependent parts, responding in growth patterns to every variation in heat and light,
storm and calm, and the change of the seasons.


The light comes slowly: up North here, in the summer, twilight remains much of the
night-driving all green things to live intensely, beating the urges for growth, brewing seeds
at a feverish pitch to prepare for survival through the long, coming, cold winter.

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The East "knows" of later change-as the light suffuses the darkness it also knows that
darkness may come--or perhaps my knowing it becomes its knowledge.


Some of us believe that everything is foreknown, that the future may be present in the
past, the end in the beginning: some of us experience time more discretely-the past apart
from the future, unknown to itself and to others. Does this change the past, does this
change beginnings?


The East is no more a beginning than the West is an end: still I project hope for change
into the rising sun the mystery of what might be. the hope of becoming, of the chrysalis
and of the empty canvas.


The East has a translucence of light: it must be the coolness of air that provides such
feyness.


My thoughts wander from my world, into a world of other beginnings, where little warmth
must nourish each day, and I am fighting the need to rush on, to master, to turn on the
heat, to make things bigger, and faster, and safer. I must stay patiently with this beginning,
I must let the East be East, begin in its good time, and trust that each tree will protect its
companion. If it will, the tree will flourish; if it won&apos;t or can&apos;t, the tree must perish; my

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Each time I deal with a new situation, a child in distress, a marriage that flounders, a
trainee who both hopes and fears the dangerous and painful learning of human involvement,
each time I must trust that growing is possible. If I become anxious or hurry my vision is
dimmed to the clarity of this beginning.


The East asks patience, waiting, and watching, trusting and caring; it produces fruits
though not fruition; it commences journeys but knows no destination-yet it too is a
fulfillment, the point where North and South end in the endless succession of the points
of the compass.

<i>Meditation on the South</i>


"My" South lies behind the hill; at this time of year the sun is high in the sky overhead--
the real South is far away, hot and oppressive at this time.


I fear the South with its parching heat, its chimeras, illusions of waters in the distant
desert, its compulsion to produce in an inferno of consummation. As I sit here I know
that what I fear is myself, that which is hot and driving, needing fast completion and
growth and pushing others to do the same; and this pushing of others&apos; quests for
self-justifications.

<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I004&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Here at the point of noon is a lazy, calm low tide: this too can be South. The water
shimmers blue, way out, pausing within the tides, leaving tidepools basking in the hot
rocks, where little infant fish dart about, attending to their growth, their activity,
enmeshed in a rehearsal of their life-sustaining skills--a play at feeding, hiding, attacking,
and resting as their nervous systems dictate-dictate their repertoire of activity.


Does it matter whether my own activities are programmed for me in the depth of my
neural substance or whether I can choose my own script? Somehow the thought that I
am but a performer in a rigidly defined pageant makes me rebellious. My need to feel
free and able to choose is overwhelming-yet the South is the compelling part of the
compass-life-giving but compelling, sending climactic activity across the synapses of
experience.

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In my phantasy I see myself gathering bits of impressions, bits of information, finding
some by chance and actively seeking others out; my phantasy of mastery concerns my
"decisions" about what to do with these bits; my reactions, no, actually my actions,
sear my pride. Divested of my image of freedom I feel impotent, being a finder and
chooser makes me feel generative and alive. Sartre thinks that the "doing" rather than
the "knowing" matters most in the human condition.


Thus alienation is expressed in the divorcement of human cause and effect--in the foods
in the bottle, in the materials-and <i>materia</i> means wood-that now come from distant
factories and consist of some coal, some air, and some power, all estranged from the
sources of life. This absence of doing, this ignorance about our role in sustaining our
own lives, creates our fear and uncertainty. We "are" but we are without any felt
contribution of ourselves to this being. Without autonomous action to be part of our
being, we feel devoid of signposts. The points of the compass turn around us, rather
than we turning to the points of the compass.

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Doing" towards survival--even pumping water or splitting wood, gives some evidence
that we are part of the process of living. Being "done to" or "done for" makes us passive
recipients and thereby prey to mere circumstance, chance, and nameless forces of disaster.
The "they," the instigators of the paranoid&apos;s loss of personal potency, fell the alienated
nonpotent man.


Where my need for autonomy lies and where letting experience impinge is one of the
tasks I must learn. The fear that passivity--soaking in the sun, immobile and dependent--
means surrender or decay, came to me as my inheritance of an achievement-oriented
civilization; yet the need to "do" to preserve that part that represents "Man the Maker."
also competes for my being. Allowing both to be part of me without either one needing
supremacy or exclusive justification is my quest.

<i>Meditation on the North</i>


Seen from this beach the North is open space, the land beyond, unknown but big,
clear, uncrowded, and free. Beyond the expanse of the water lie big wooded islands,
crowned by mountains that sustain forests, berries, deer, and fish. Life, that is hard but
sustainable, freedom from crowding and the petulance of unwanted closeness.


There is a purity to my vision. Somehow the interrelatedness of the individual to others
recedes and the power of oneness comes into focus. Still, as I look on this aloneness my
fear of being dependent reaches my awareness--my old fear that those I am depending
on may not hear me, or if they do, may also choose not to respond. This is the dilemma
of all relatedness--as with mother and child--this need-fear dilemma taints all human
relatedness. Only hope and trust can assure this matrix of all love.

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The fear of my role poisons many of my relationships. The "having" to need or "having-not-to-need
voids the freedom to love and to be loved. Knowing the North of my soul
to be open for aloneness makes relationships possible; knowing I can survive in the wide open
spaces allows me to be in crowds. Knowing that relationships are available lets me venture
out North towards the long inland passages at the distant horizon.


The North casts images of hope, of the ability of life to persist in precarious and hostile
places; of the lichen on the rock, the fungi alive in the deep-dark shade, evergreens surviving
bitter winds and frost. Yes, the North tells of survival and persistence and these tropisms
that let light be found among darkness and warmth within frost.

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Distant storms send waves to this shore from the North, brewed days ago in the cauldron
fed by Aleutian frosts and warmer waters beyond. Now this remote past event spawned
this wave that dies near my toe. This distant brew of weather has been felt by myriads of
fish and other sea life, has made kelp forests weave, and sent plankton towards its destination.
Somewhere, this distant weather also has held me in its grip as my internal marine environment
responds to the physical and chemical pull of these tides and tidings.


The North confronts me with that part of me that is yet enthralled by the tides of the
moon, the tides of the seasons, that part of me that is a mirror of the universe of which I
am a part.


The North is pure being, pure existence as a mirror whose image is beholden to the reflected
image--a reflection of reality which, in turn, is yet another reflection of the reality of this
reflection.

<i>Meditation on the West</i>


The West has always pulled me. Do I follow the sunset to undo it--following it so that the
sun will never set; or am I infatuated with the death of the day, the death of warmth, the
permission not to be? There is a playing with not-being, a need to rehearse and reassure
myself in this fascination with the setting sun. West is the setting sun, the daily immolation
that our best experience tells us is not final--just temporary, just for <i>one</i> night and not forever
and yet each sunset could be the last one!


This past year, endings have become more important; I am learning to watch for them more
carefully and avoid the seduction of avoiding them. The true validation of the greeting lies
in the possibility of leave-taking. Thus entrances and exits, coming and going, introduction
and taking departure are the lodestones of care. Aware of my own comings and goings as the
focus of transaction, I get in touch with the pain and stress of human encounters: needing
care, taking care, and taking leave: allowing the fears and pains of newness and separation to
come into the open frees the process of related existence for caring and love. The Western
sun is the symbol of a departing caretaker.


As the sun dips below the horizon, a chill falls over the earth--a chill of death, to be again
forgotten in the flamboyant afterplay of mood and color in the Western sky. The day&apos;s
embrace has been, never to be repeated exactly the same!

[p. <i>[45]</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As a child, I was troubled with doubts about the constancy of objects: did things really exist
in the dark; were they "really" present when the light was out? The validation of the nature
of things became an outwitting game that the flip of the lightswitch or the furtive touch in the
dark could never completely answer; indeed, the craftiness of things might easily consist of
their lightningly quick way of reemergence upon my checking for them. The phantasy that we
may be part of the magnificent illusion of some universal being is a very unsettling bit of
speculation.


The West brings to me chastising confrontations of deeds undone: the shoulds and the
oughts. The West pulls me away from experience to censuring, from being to having to be,
and seduces me into the bargain of life--the archaic contract of survival in exchange for
selling one&apos;s soul--the performance contract with which a God intrudes upon my existence.
As I take leave of this day, I hope for endings that are a part of what is ended, as the
capstone is of the architrave--distinct, purposeful, yet of the fabric of the arch.

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At each point of the compass, I must not want to placate but <i>be</i>--be part of both beginnings and
endings, free from having to control or contract, but to act when I wish to act, to receive when I
wish to receive, and to give when I want to give.


I meditate on the points of the compass--the arbitrary limits of a world, a sphere without beginning
or end.

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tuesday<br />
June 24


Somehow I woke in discomfort, concerned that either H. or E. were in distress--probably E. with
health or fatigue; I am curious whether this is ESP or projection as I feel low and still tired from
last night. I spoke to my office as we had prearranged a telephone call. So many things to do today:
I want to write about the teacher&apos;s part in developing the pupil&apos;s self; how each teacher, though
especially an educational therapist working with a very dysfunctional child--becomes the <i>other</i>--
the prototype of fellowman and thereby helps the pupil to become human, open, and functioning.


E. told me that I am sometimes not stating my premises and that people do not know where I am,
but he assures me that I can state the next move I have in mind when asked. I hope this is true;
I think I do; but even as a youngster my peers seemed to feel puzzled and bored by me and often
I by many of them. There are so few people who really fulfill me in conversation. Why is this and
<i>how</i> can I change? What is there about my mind that is so strange? Is it my different growing-up
experience or do I follow a distant drummer whose rhythm may be obscure? When I am with the
few people whose wavelength I can receive, I feel deeply gratified and those periods of communion
stay with me vivid and precious. These are the only real moments of mutuality; somehow the
raptures of coitus are much more receiving and less mutual. Maybe the feeling of receiving so much
pleasure dims the awareness that I am giving pleasure, too. In dialogue, I find rare moments of
mutuality.

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

12:30 p.m.


I wrote five pages on self-differentiation and the development of a sense of self; how the teacher
is an important other in bringing this about, and I think I wrote well. I took my lunch to the
beach--missed H. who usually lunches on the beach with me and then suddenly started collecting
glass and rocks and ended this as suddenly as I started. What are these internal signals that break
up time, initiate, and end activity? There was no awareness of conscious volition, goal-setting, or
closure; but when it was all over, I felt that I had been part of a different rhythm, a slow, inner
beat that cued me to action and to closure in a rewarding way. Perhaps the external rhythm of
life is a more confining straight-jacket than we often acknowledge. Right now I feel so free living
by this internal clock.


This searching among time patterns also concerns some of the so-called new life style and might
be called the revolt of the polychrones. Edward Hall in his <i>Silent Language</i> describes two disparate
ways in which man in differing cultures deals with time and space. In some, time is
compartmentalized or "encapsulated" as in the Tiv people who live in Nigeria and to whom
time is like a capsule. There is time for visiting, for cooking, or for working; and if one is in one
of these times, one does not shift to another. Space, too, may be similarly compartmentalized by
function, or else allow various functions to occupy the same area; as in the Japanese living space
where function preempts the space and defines it in a temporary fashion: as use changes, sliding

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Hall shows us how different cultures experience, name, and use space and time differently, so
differently in fact that men of diverse cultures do not even suspect that their own space-time
experience might differ from that of other men. They are locked into having to read their
fellowman&apos;s cues like their own and thus get faulty information.


Our industrial-achievement culture is a monochronic culture par excellence, "a time and place for
everything!" is its mandate--getting the "farthest and fastest," starting and finishing: order, method,
the timepiece and the calendar. Lewis Mumford suggests that our modern industrial culture is
based on the timepiece.


The young rebelled, emboldened by hearing that the doors of perception could be opened to
reveal a time and a place different from their school-bell existence. They, too, started to experiment
with polychronous and multispatial life styles. In the face of the establishment they flouted the
timetable by hitchhiking in a random manner across the globe, resting in Nepal, suddenly pulling
up stakes to stroll the Etoile, or to appear, ill-kept, gypsylike, in their parent&apos;s stainless steel and
plastic livingroom. The barrier between the polychrones and the monochrones was up-each
considering every member of the other tribe demented, bewitched, and condemned.

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The civilization that created a straight, compartmentalized mainstreet and a piazza respectively
found each other in eye-to-eye confrontation. The civilization that by default allocated 60 percent
of its living space to the automobile became attacked by the gypsy, the villager, and the Communard.


Slowly, the ecologist, the city planner, the thoughtful citizens of either camp, are sitting down to
evaluate what this revolt is about, to sift out what can be used to allow for different lifestyles,
both of them adapted to human needs. Slowly the monochron and polychron gather in each
other&apos;s time perceptions and are trying to get in touch with the experience on the other side of
the river of time.


As all new roletaking, this is hard work-trapped in our own mold, it troubles our sleep to enter that
of others, as a stranger&apos;s mold is like a dangerous unknown cave--we know not how we would fare
there. Slow exploration, gaining courage and experience, leads us farther into this territory and each
successful foray enlarges our lifespace.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Tuesday noon


It is raining quite hard. I made a very good fire and am fixing supper for myself. This fire is burning
wood I carried up from the beach. I feel potent like primal man who could warm himself.


I like this doing for myself right now, but I know I also need the complications of being with
others. Yet giving and receiving, taking and giving out become so difficult; it is so hard to level
and to say what one wants or what one does not want; there is so much doubt about how much
there is in each of us that we have to play games of withholding or overgiving. H. is less caught
up in this and I suppose he makes it easy for me to give to him most of the time. He is so
receptive and responsive. Still, with the intensity of his life I must beware of asking too much
of him and must watch for what his needs are.


But many of us are not only caught by wanting and needing love but also having to avoid it--
avoiding the awesome power of love. Avoidance of love and being loved is strange, self-defeating,
and deeply energy-consuming. In our culture, the acknowledgment of love feelings in ourselves or
of receiving them as they come from others often is more energy-absorbing and defeating than
most hate and pain combined. What makes this danger loom so big, so threatening that it calls forth
such heroic defense?

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The primitive magic fear that others may have powers over us, the need to guard our selfhood, or
manhood, and freedom of action springs up when love threatens. In this sense the defense is
against a love that is perceived as enslaving, demanding a return, often a phantasy that such return
may be life-sapping, permanently crippling, and unavoidable. Here the fear is one of loss of
autonomy and potency and obviously derives from "love" experiences that in reality have been
marketplace transactions with a price for services rendered--often unbidden or uncalled for. But
this defense against being loved and loving is often more accessible to corrective experience than
the second kind of defense.


This even more deeply magic dread lies within the archetypical myths where love transforms; where
Snow White awakens, the frog turns into a prince, where the magic of love performs the magic of
change, where the hidden image becomes visible through the fascination of love bestowed. Here,
a fear that love might bring change-even "good" change is resisted, and love denied in order to
safeguard against a change in inertial direction.

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes this resistance to being loved speaks to a fear of discovering worth and goodness in one
who must perceive himself unworthy and evil. If I were loved, and loved without having to return
it, I really might be worthy and good, rather than guiltful, rich rather than poor. Such a change of
perception is resisted in many ways, as fear of change threatens many fabrics of thought and action.
Yet, those fabrics are the ones that contribute to the entropy of depression, defeat, and malaise.
Thus the defense against love becomes the guardian of sameness, the watchdog of discontent and
despair.


Denying the defense against love in this its deepest manifestation is a defense against being loved,
not against "obligations" or "relationships"; thus denying the transformational power of such
acknowledgment, such an acknowledgment is avoided lest it touch the self-image, giving it new,
"positive" attributes to be dealt with. The avoider in his fearful defense often will fight hard and
desperately to ward off this danger; and with tumultuous frightened energy drives himself away. The
odor and color of fear and defense, the obscuration of the surrounding by squid-like murkiness
and the smell of panic are often successful in keeping the defender "inviolate." At rare moments
when the sender of love messages can remain at his place, and continues sending his message like a
lighthouse, through storm and lightnings, at all hours of the day and all seasons of the year, the
light may reach, and over a long time the self may find permission to see and contemplate the
risk of change.

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As such a transformation happens, the archaic myths of the transfiguration by love come into
reality. Oddly enough, when this happens, both the lover and the loved one seem unaware how and
from where this change came, thus leaving the freedom and purity of selfhood inviolate.


Transformations are the fabric of life--the change of energy states, of growth, and of experience.
Yet we spend much of our time trying to preserve sameness--even the sameness of pain: sameness
regardless of its content. The preservation of the steady state, of homeostasis, while life preserving
and energy conserving in many ways, also entails a defense against the new, the eternal trap of the
repetition compulsion.


The defense against being loved, against trying and taking risks, letting the self expand into new
forms of expression and experience, all these maneuvers are part of our security operations.


Perhaps I crave the seashore to give me deep communion with that which changes, to take courage
from this dynamic model for being. As I immerse myself in experiencing the changing shore, my own
desires to change, my own needs for change, and my power to change emerge and activate my being.


Fear and trembling is mine, when I accept the fate of change, yet I <i>must</i> go on and <i>want</i> to go on,
as stagnation threatens me with extinction.

Later


The CBU FM station is broadcasting the International Violin Competition from Montreal and the
Russian winner is playing the Tschaikowski violin concerto in the style of Jewish fiddlers-full of
gypsy kitch-and right now I am giving in to his sensuality. What divergent moods I can succumb to:
how divergent man is, from shouting into the wind to submitting to maudlin eroticism, from utter
dependency to having to reinvent the wheel!


I went on my evening walk; it ceased raining and the beach is still glistening with cleanliness. It was
slippery and all kinds of new muscles held me upright. I felt different parts of me working--a feeling
of newness inside me.


The sea is clear and lapped the shore with a squishing sound; I was told that the clear water is cold,
and sure enough when I went in to wade it felt icy. How these micro-knowledges arise; people
living on one little shore observe and learn through closeness and necessity and a style of folk
knowledge or folk lore springs up; when this meets the mainstream of "science" it often does not
bear up because it is just a location-bound insight; then the scientist derides the folk wisdom and it
is lost. Again when it is discovered as valid, the obscurantist elevates it to universal wisdom and we will
find ourselves in a belief-disbelief squirrel cage, a closed system of confusion.

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I find the folklore here interesting--so much is right for here. The weather and wind lore, the
knowledge of where the fish are, and what wood to get for a fire--these are knowledges of
survival value. It feels good to be closer to basic survival, but also to know that man can move
farther away and create beyond the immediately given; that there are generalizations as big as the
universe and as little as the neutrino, like pristine myths about antimatter or facts as coldly rational
as the circumference of the square; that there is DNA, and memory storage, immunity and myriad
generalizations beyond this earth-and-water-bound shore. Still it is important to return to this basic
abode of beginning of life, theirs and ours. It is good to be with the tides and the sky, and the tidal
life; to be close to the rhythms of the earth and a step closer to the universe.


It seems hard for me to remember from one day to the next when the tides occurred; the days and
hours appear to blur. It is with effort that I am able to recall and thus can predict. Those who
could reach beyond the comfort of just being with the shore and be masters of their memories
must have become the seers and leaders, the tribe&apos;s repository of memories that had survival value.
A better and clearer memory had socio-genetic advantages and provided selective breeding for
leadership.


Better and further searching memories would lead to more predictable food supplies and better
utilization of resources. Those men who were more firmly anchored in their space-time dimension
possessed reproductive advantages; men who could recall seasonal occurrences, whose memory storage

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps these seers and leaders became further differentiated into those seers who were endowed
with creativity that lent an abundance of linkages between ideas thereby perceiving many new
patterns of thought--to be donors of colorful dreams, and those with more stratified memories
who would see one or at most a very few connections in stark and clear relief; these then became
the leaders whose minds tended to build simple patterns in black and white to be callers to action
or donors of laws.


While man is often called the "pattern-maker," I wonder whether patterns might not be man-makers--
as the design of each man&apos;s pattern shapes his destiny and the destiny of his companions in time.

Later


My favorite Brahms violin sonata came on CBU radio. I had just finished, late at night, doing my
dishes and putting things back on the new shelves. I put my house in order, and it was a good
ordering--now the Brahms Sonata in D--and I feel happier than I have in years. It is a quiet, soft
happiness that touches my breastbone with warmth and pulls my shoulder blades away from my
chest. I wish I could <i>give</i> this feeling, give it to others, just to taste it; even though it will not last
it stays as a trace. It is much like H. and I sitting on Leith Hill and looking across the Downs, thirty
years ago.


A very heavy downpour awakened me. For a moment I was confused and afraid and realized I had
been groping for H.&apos;s warm skin and had not found it. There is animal safety in a bed companion; it
was not that I wanted help, just contact. It is clearing now and an easterly is churning the sea with
whitecaps.

Wednesday afternoon


I expected that this would turn out to be a poor day; I had pushed so hard on my writing last
night. Instead, things went well and, if I can judge at all, I did some good writing.


I went up to Berry Point, walked along the beach, the sun is out, the rain has stored growing
energy all around, the earth is steaming with bursting growth, the wildflowers are luxuriant and the
smell of washed nature is almost anesthetic. Texada Island lies etched against the sky, the Inland
Passage beckons and the world seems open and challenging.


Perhaps there is so much unhappiness among us as we learn to expect "fulfillment" instead of
"fulfilling" that we want to see Spring as something permanent rather than as a prelude to Fall and
a new Spring; perhaps in that sense the joy of becoming is greater than the joy contained in being.


When I sat on the Point some of last night&apos;s happiness returned and it occurred to me why I am so
fond of this Brahms violin sonata: to me it mirrors sexual union, the changing of leads, the rising
to sensual heights, returning and rising again, each partner leading the way from ecstasy to repose. I
wonder whether others feel this in the music. How little do I know where others are!

9:00 p.m.


This is one of those glorious translucent evenings; I waded into the sunset--it is a wild orgiastic
feeling as if one could go on and reach the sun. H. and I once swam far, far out that way, being
pulled out by the promise of light. This is like a spell--the spell of the Northern summer that erupts
from coldness and dark, the spell that leads man to sun and fire-worship, a spell that seems to
lighten the step, heighten the senses, and intoxicates the spirit. The writings and poetry of
Scandinavia speak of all this; the growing up of Kristin Lavransdater on Midsummer-night is part of
this lore. I almost blinded myself looking at the setting sun as a sailboat kept crisscrossing the
golden band on the water. The sea had become glass-smooth, the gulls had become quiet and the
sun lowered its face to the night.


The slight chill of awe and dusk enveloped me and I came in and made a painstaking fire, feeling
like an adrogynous worshipper in the days of the Goatgod.

Thursday, June 26<br />
5:30 a.m.


The birds and a rising wind awoke me at 4:30. Night is so brief at this time. Dutifully I turned
around to return to sleep, only to awaken at 5:15 with the sudden idea that I was my own woman,
would not disturb anyone and could arrange my clock as I chose. It is a grey morning as we often
have after a clear sunset; the tide is out. After last night&apos;s apex, this mood is lesser, but not sad
and still full of having experienced the fullness of the previous night&apos;s mysteries.


When I awoke for the first time this morning, my awakening thought was that with all the depths
and varieties of emotions that I have allowed, anger, so prevalent usually, has not been one of them
and I wonder about this difference in feeling.


John Jones said to me yesterday about some quirk of his, "You must think it strange for a boy
to ... " referring to himself. He is pushing 70, driven, burdened, anxious, troubled by ill health,
and is still the "boy"; I am leaving my reproductive years and still dealing with becoming and being
a woman and with professional growth. How short a lifetime is for growing!

Yesterday I saw Jane again and we spoke of our loves for "our" men and our island. We seemed
closer for a time, but still I was diffident and less free. There are a number of women I like and
admire and still somehow I cannot get closeness; I seem to threaten them when I wish to become
their friend; still some of my best and enhancing therapeutic relationships have been with women
of middle age or adolescence.

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Friday, June 27<br />
Evening


Writing went well this morning. Then I took the 8 a.m. ferry to town, hoping to come back on the
10:30. However, getting a part for my water heater became typically difficult with nonmatching,
noninterchangeable parts so that I had to settle for the 12:15. I used the time to get some
Christmas gifts from B. D., some beautiful handmade candles. But all in all for the first time. I
felt the pressured kind of annoyance that civilized delays engender in me. It must be my need for
quick mastery that gets in the way and keeps me from being able to settle down and accept such
delays with internal grace. When it is loss or disaster I can; when it is a man misplanned problem,
I cannot.


Yet man and time are odd companions with each of us assuming that our clocks are <i>the</i> clocks.
Jules Henry wrote a beautiful piece, "Poor People&apos;s Time," that speaks of the cultural benchmarks
of time; Hall in the <i>Silent Language</i>, too, deals with that parametric aspect of time. There is so
much that confounds, that confuses, that angers, having to do with time and timing: from letters
that did not arrive in time to prepare for a subsequent phone call based on the content of that
letter, to attributing knowledge of futures to other cultures or children who either culturally
or developmentally are functioning in time dimensions different from ours.

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The other day, a large group of people picnicked at the bank of our beach. They sat on the little
path, which was obviously used, and they came with many, many things. They seemed curiously
uninvolved with the beach and involved in their potato salads and hotdogs. This morning I found
litter strewn all over that spot. I feel deeply angry that people could be so thoughtless, and
condemned the heedless and uneducated, until it suddenly came clear to me that the time sense
of people from certain subcultures does not include representation of <i>later, future, or after-one-left</i>.
Therefore the image of what it would look like after the feast, or even more so what it might
look like to others would be absent. And as I gain this awareness a lot of angry pain about what
"some people do" leaves me, and I ponder how unable I had been to role-take and understand.


Later


I went to the beach to recover, open to the sun. I lay down on a smooth sandstone slab and let
my back muscles become one with the rock, I <i>became</i> the rock, my back assumed the outline of the
rock and I fell asleep--a wonderful, limp, complete sleep; when I awoke the irritation was gone and
the sea beckoned. I went for a swim, and the tingle of the salt and the few waves caressed me so
that I could love my body--not through vanity or judgment, but because it was filled with sensory
feelings of rock, and water, and salt drying in the sun.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I returned a casedraft had arrived. It was hard to change to the type of reasoning that has to
attempt to gauge how far a student can see, how acutely he can hear, and what the maximal
distance for his learning is. This case seemed so terribly shut off; the student is just starting
fieldwork but has been a counselor in a large high school for years; she is seeing a girl, the oldest
one, who had been caught up in a serious incestuous entanglement with her father. The mother
tricked the father into coming to her in order to serve him legal papers. The girl knew about it and
now the father took her younger sister home but not her; this child is outwardly gay, a gay
deceiver, and the student chose to become deceived about the lack of feeling and meaning that this
event had for this 16-year-old girl--my student needed to be protected from the hurt that the
child must feel. How does one breach this--and if we don&apos;t, what kind of mental health worker will
this student become?


Right now when I am experiencing not more, but so much more deeply, dealing with such emotional
seclusion is very, very hard--how I wish there was a drug one could administer. Having to learn the
interpersonal way is so hard and so hazardous, but so important!


At least to me teaching others appears the most worthwhile activity I can choose. Teaching has to
do with an extension of the self, the need to procreate, procreate skills and insights.

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Saturday morning<br />
June 28


This was a bad scene! The woman who bought the acreage behind us came with her partner. They
offered me six acres for $10,000 and one for $3,000. I sat between them and felt like the "victim"
in a Pinter play, where the protagonist gets badgered by doubletalking intruders, who do not
make true sense but are perfectly in concert with each other, like a dissonant ballet ensemble. I am
now torn about this; I dislike to have to make decisions now, when I want to remain with my other
agenda. I called H. who was helpful but baffled; then I proceeded to write unadulterated drivel.
Pulled myself together this morning by re-reviewing books and re-outlining and hope that I can
get going again. I am right now writing about the role of the teacher and find this peculiarly hard--
it must also have something to do with some of my ambivalence about teachers and teaching.


While I am a poor housekeeper at home, here I make my bed carefully every morning, do dishes
and tidy and straighten--keeping "my" house; I unexpectedly set a real table for myself and
arrange food on my plates--I had expected to live out of cans.

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Noon


I went to Ron Suite, my real estate broker, who is fortunately still on the island and he offered to
come over later this afternoon. Apparently the prospect of succor or sharing lifted some of the
burden off me, and I wrote--I think--more cogently. Mr. Suite came and accepted being my agent
with full power; he is against my buying the 10 acres, as I really was too, but also thinks that I may
not really need the one acre either. Also, he says that they might put the road at the back of the
lot, in which case I really do not want the property. It seems that the Provincial Health Department
has been rougher on drainage and sanitation, and Mr. Suite thinks that there may be trouble with
lot sizes. I feel vastly better--his tall, quiet, humor has assuaged some of the troubled feelings in
me. I was amazed how much I wanted him to take over and make my decision.


After he left I went down to the beach; it was softly raining and I walked in the warm rain. It was
very slippery, but my beachlegs are strong now and I savor my footedness. I came home drenched,
set a fire, adding some fir for crackling and sparking and felt more calm again.

Evening


It is done, it is done--the basic skeleton of my book is written! I have 156 triple-spaced pages,
about 27,000 words; I am letting it lie now for a few days and then will start looking it over.

Sunday, June 29<br />
5:00 a.m.


The birds awaken me; the morning appears to break slowly--I must be projecting my slowing down.
I know that some mornings seem to come with a start, some just arrive, and some are like incipient
gentle rains. This one came with a conundrum:
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Are you the breathless lover<br />
who left the house at dawn<br />
faceless but swift?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Are you the wind that sighed<br />
among the trembling alders<br />
at dusk?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Are you the wave that washed gently<br />
over that pebble I dropped<br />
idly dreaming of lovers?</i>

Morning


I went back to sleep and awoke, ready for active mundane things; went to town on the ferry to
buy polish and varnish and proceeded to wax floors and varnish furniture. I am stiff now but
satisfied. The mad frenzy of getting the draft written has passed. However, I thought hard about it
and came to the conclusion that I do have the need to broadcast it, to have it circulated and that
just catharsis alone was not my goal--I had wondered about that because of the push I felt. I
think--and this may well be sadly delusional--that my manuscript has some new things to say, or
some old insights stated in a way that perhaps some new people might pick them up and find
useful.

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Afternoon


Somewhere this time had to come to an end-but my hope to retain some of the searches and some
of the findings, some of the feelings and some of the images kept recurring. My need to <i>eternalize</i>--
one of the sources of art-good or bad-emerged, and I began to try to design with beach stone
and glass. The kitchy urge to make shell designs must be strong and I could not resist it. I
played around with casting resin, trying to anchor into permanence that which seduces eye and
touch on the beach; perhaps we all have a need for permanence and such beachcraft permits this
illusion: perhaps this is a way of expressing mastery, or to lock what we know to be evanescent into
permanence in time. Probably all these play a part: the need to bind the changeable, the need to
order the random, and the need of Western man to touch the wild with civilization-nature with
man-action.


Often, on my beachcombing expeditions I would gather a few things at one time and feel a need to
keep them together in one place. After awhile I would discard such separate containers to pour my
gatherings into a common one; yet when doing this I felt uneasy, as if I really did not want to
do this-but in the absence of a visible "reason" I would do the "reasonable."

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I made my first plaque, I made it from four beach objects I had gathered at one time: a
tree-like piece of kelp, a pink piece of glass, a light blue one, and one smooth brown pebble.
Instantly, I seemed to know the arrangement I wanted. Thus, I must have carried this pattern in my
brain as I gathered them up from the beach.


Suddenly I understood my strange need to keep the seemingly random beachcombings of one
expedition together: they shared a common fate, some obscure program my brain had evolved for
that particular moment in time so that the urge to keep these gatherings together flowed from the
existence of such a hidden pattern.


If we could only know these patterns or even be aware that we are following patterns from within
ourselves. So often we think we are responding to external cues when we are actually following one
of our internal programs. Awareness of this might save us from many bouts with windmills, and
still more importantly from struggles with people as we react to our pattern rather than to theirs.


Perhaps true awareness is like a window into the world of past patterns and expectations--that
minute segment of a reflection of reality that is least bound into the programs of our minds.
Philosophers and scientists have struggled with this--if there is a clear answer I do not know, yet
there are experiences that give us the illusion that we are more closely in touch with, and more
aware of our <i>real</i> surroundings. Is this true awareness, or just another pattern of awareness?

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later


I have to sum up--I was planning to, but E.&apos;s concerned question brought me to this sooner. I was
aware that this was manic behavior--I had known before that I was going on a forced tour. I
believe, and that may be a distortion, that I have to work this way; every major task I ever did
was done in this style: my style is one of slowly preparing (this time much conscious preparation
was also done as I brought my notes, outline, and two dozen selected reference books), but the
actualization of the task, the writing, the plan, the poem, the mosaic are always done in a frenzied
time-limited spell.


This reoccurs every few years, and in retrospect, these periods represent my peak functioning. E&apos;s
concern put me more clearly in touch with the fact, that each time I go on such a trip, I too, am
afraid that my frenzy may get away from me, that the experience could be greater than my controls
and that deceleration and cognitive clarity may elude me.


These are trips into the unknown--they are risks, and I never really let myself feel how aware and
concerned about the risk I am. Somehow I seek support from the outside, assuring me that the
risk is worthwhile and that someone is standing by. Talking to H. and E. on the phone was quite
important. It seems that these "frenzies" are related to wrenching part of myself to externalize
either as symbols or content. Each time I had to be alone, away from those who represent
relationships that are needful--each time there was an anxious question whether I would succeed.

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It would be easy to explain the "rush" because of my limited time for aloneness. Essays, sermons,
mosaics were always based on H.&apos;s absence of at most three days; this time I had ten. I believe,
however, that there may be a choice involved, and that perhaps my aloneness serves to shield others
from me and my frenzy.


This kind of watching of myself that goes on at that time, I think, is protective; with all this, I
increased my breathing exercises, swam, walked, and drained off excess emotion, as I cared for my
well-being.


I think a few days ago I said something about playing "chicken" with the elements; perhaps this is
playing chicken with my sanity--but then <i>who</i> plays chicken?


There is so much that is contradictory in me--so much looking for calm during the storm and looking
for storms during calm. Still, all this is me.

this side of Hiroshima: near Barabas, near Buchenwald, near Milai--<br />
but not far from each man!</i>

Later


I felt aimless and empty; immobile, locked to a standstill, yet I needed to find out where I was
going. I went for a walk and the last line of my Gabriola sonnet came to me and I suddenly knew
that my creative frenzy meant being a "hot, glowing blue star" and that my frenzy sets in to
avoid "stagnant death."


To me, cold is death. These last few days, a number of times, I had thought about the strange
difference in what is seen as a vital threat. A friend told me with visible emotion how profoundly
threatened he felt as a child by the raging fever of typhoid. I became anxious, the other day on the
beach when I gave up some heat and <i>I</i> radiated it to the sky. When the clouds were racing by as
they covered the sun, I felt deeply anxious--and was aware that this was from the "giving up" of
heat, not really being cold. I have to produce and receive heat to feel alive and safe--and frantic
activity is such a validation. My controls are there, as I fear exhaustion--exhaustion leading to
stillness, coldness, and death. I love the Northern summer because of its torridness, because of its
negation of cold. I even remember a green tile stove I loved as a child and I hugged in winter like a
"wire mother."

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The act of creating, too, is a denial of death and an affirmation of immortality. I am not sure that
I crave "immortality" but I fear dying. I think I have conquered the abject, cringing, panic-filled
fear of death of my adolescence and middle years; dying is probably more frightening now than
death. But I do defend against death and creating, and newness and becoming are ways of fighting
and even denying death.


The other emerging image was of one of fighting my demon alone--perhaps I believe in this magic
and must therefore seek "lone battlegrounds." While these images came I felt exhilarated because
they fit--now somehow, the joy is gone; I feel deflated, as if a prize had been taken from me and I
don&apos;t know why.


Since finishing my draft, I had done many taking-care things. My life vacillates between rare spurts
of innovation and the daily tasks of conservation--fighting rust and stains, reconciling bank
statements. Perhaps this is why I feel flat--perhaps the prospect of this makes me angry--though
this morning I waxed and varnished with joy. This noon I cast beach things in clear resin.


Animal triste post coitum ... this must be the time to look back and a time to become tame
again. The vision of the sailboat following the wake of the sun must stay with me--the sun sets, but
the sun also rises.

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, the days of the poet and seer are drawing to a close. The intensive realities of my phantasies
must depart to make room for a more measured rhythm, syncopated by outside time and for
images closer to the events of the day.


The poet, the seer, and dreamer are in total touch with the elements, those within and those without:
with time that may telescope yesterday and today and tomorrow into but one time, stretch
yesterday into a future or present, or combine and recombine them into a million variations of
temporal themes. They are in touch with places of the mind and of the body, places of qualities,
places beyond and within. They are where thought is action and action but an image, where
retribution is lethal and invariant, or again where mortal sins are venial. They are in a land where all
paths merge and the highways lead to nowhere--plantations of deaths and deserts of perpetual bloom.


The world of the poet, seer, and dreamer needs to be accessible to all of us to sort out "reality"
against the backdrop of nonreality, being against not-being, doing against not-doing, willing against
not-willing; in short, so that we may test such reality by placing it up against the not-real; only by
doing so, is there a reality to perceive.

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Only the phantasy world fully permits such an assumption of roles, the testing of different ways
of being, of feeling, and of acting. To be oneself the limits of the other must be experienced; the
self grows as the other is more fully defined and the ultimate definition derives from an ability to
assume his role or at least some aspects of his role. In the realm of the poet, seer, and dreamer,
such roles can be created and discarded, tried in many contexts and developed into new ones.
Those of us who can, in a small way, take such knowledge back into the realm of the "walking-working"
have gained in our capacity to understand and feel with some others.


As these days are leaving, I feel ambivalent about abandoning this realm even though images of
fear, awe, and strangeness had beset me here, and called upon all my fortitude. They enveloped me
with strangeness in the sense that I could not "know" what to cope with or foretell what means
for coping might become available to me. Yet, the large vistas and the newness, the transformations
permitted within this diversity--these insights and sights make me reluctant to leave.

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I prepare for "re-entry," I hope that much I have dealt with here will be accessible, accessible
for future use, so that I may become a fuller and more productive and insightful person. This wish
is not without hazards-for were this dream world at the full beck and call of the awakened, it
would be a dream world no longer; were it inaccessible, it would, of course, be lost to the waking
state. Therefore, let me hope that some window may remain open, permitting momentary visions
to cast their shadows over my waking state.


Somewhere the wish for a paradise on earth, the phantasy of omniscience and omnipotence, the
yearnings of the poet, the wisdom of the seer, and the freedom of the dreamer ask for such
visions. Yet, the needs of homo sapiens and homo faber, also, assert themselves, assert and demand
that I deal with reality.


I acquiesce to this fate in the hope that a window into the beyond remain open for me. I wish to
keep some power to divine the riddles contained in the unknown, so that I may continue to venture
into those spaces on my map that are still marked "terra incognita"; and so that my eyes may know
the shadows of distant visions and my ears the sound of songs that passed; so that I may know of
passions dreamed and of the reasons of the heart; so that I may feel the unsaid and hear the
unstated-so that I may be a poet, a seer, and a dreamer!

Monday, June 30<br />
Morning


A day to <i>be!</i> I woke late and remembered much dreaming had happened--the fragments that came
up were simple little wish-fulfillments--like a child getting all the toys he wants. It came to me that
I had done no dreaming at the height of my writing. Dream research suggests that dreaming is
highly restorative and that under the impact of extreme emotional preoccupation, dreaming
decreases or ceases--perhaps I was living my dream--and fulfilling a dream as the vernacular
states. Perhaps this also accounts for the dreamlike feeling during the creative act.


As I awoke the phrase "the troubled sleep of being" came into my awareness. Yes, this beach
mirrors the dreamlike in my being, the shifting and changing, the accommodations and the
strainings. Now my beach walk is precarious, clinging to the narrow remaining rockshelf-last
week&apos;s low tides provided a choice of paths within a wide band of low tidal rock. My field of
action--that which appears as reality and at <i>that</i> moment as the only existing reality--exists
within a wide band of possibilities--thus, asking for differing adjustments and creating varying
states of feelings; at times a field of seemingly unlimited opportunities appears to lie ahead as
a low level of encroachment opens wide vistas, then at other times, we appear to be hanging on,
clinging to a narrow choice of alternatives.

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The dream of our being is the combination of our vistas and the responses evoked in us, daring,
against just managing, being open and cornucopious against hoarding or of holding on to what
one has; this dream is the infinity of our responses among an infinity of visions!


Now my days here are drawing to a close. Not only the dream but also the dreamer was changed
by the dream. Peer Gynt&apos;s simile of the onion representing the infinite layers of the human
existence is one way of representing the endless imperative for change as each dream changes each
dreamer, and as he, in turn wills a fate that represents his new dream.


I took the typewriter to bed and listened transfixed to a Gilels concert. CBU FM has been my
constant companion, and what a wonderful one. Their music is superb, their news very good,
poetry readings, and editorial shows exciting. With all that, the voices, the clipped, slow, sensitively
repressed male voices of the dying British upper-upper professional middle class are pleasantly
nostalgic to me. Also, I enjoy the Provincial weather forecasts, both land and marine--the mention
of the beautifully strange Indian and pioneer names is like a beckoning travel map to me: places
in the great North where people wait for many cold months for a brief summer.

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Strange, that this theme of cold and summer should re-emerge. Along with it, came a recollection
of my first, deep, pervasive excitement about science. It was in my basic physics class in grade 8; I
had liked biology and been apprehensive of physics when I became highly involved and excited by
the Second Law of Thermodynamics: the fatalistic concept of entropy created my involvement,
speculation, and avid participation in this class, and I briefly thought of physics as a career.


Later, the concept of homeostasis evoked the same personally tinged response, possibly leading to
my master&apos;s thesis with a concern of the autonomic nervous system. How strangely these things fit
together, how elemental the seemingly most "advanced" cognitive faculties are, how bound to the
unconscious as are all our passions--both our passions and our abstractions! How passionate our
humanity and how human our passions!

Monday morning


It is early, the tide is low and I search through the rockbed and the tidepool below the shallow
ridge in the rock. There are many beautiful brown and white shells on the beach this year.
Suddenly, there is one lying upside down, with a beautifully strange ivory inclusion in its hollow.
I pick it up to inspect it, touch it and find it velvety soft and moist and wonder for one instant
what this may be. Then I startle when I realize that this "inclusion" is the living shellfish. Often
we are so used to behold only the inanimate record of extinguished life, that even face to face
with life we may be puzzled and fail recognition. We are more attuned to celebrate life latent than
life imminent--life past than life present!

Monday noon


The post brought mail today. One was from a friend. He is in pain and in his pain he tells
me how he is asked to give, to give so much that he becomes depleted. But he aches with a
sense of distance wanting to hide and yet wanting to stir forth to be part of others. Somewhere
in his youth he had experienced demands, so insatiable that this fear of not coming up with
the expected gifts keep him at an anxious, angry periphery of his relationships. Yet this peripheral
position makes him feel lonely, aching, tired, and easily angered--often angered at his own
impotence at not being able to say yes and often not being able to say no.


I wish he could trust how overwhelmingly large the reservoir of his gifts is, he could enjoy
the good things he does and acknowledge the bounteous harvest he actually produces; instead
he gives out bread while announcing a stone-sale.


I answered my mail and as I finished the sun had returned, blazing, with blue skies and azure
seas, as if it had never departed. I went down to the shore--we are still in the moonphase of
extreme tides and the tide was far out: and I found a dry, smooth rock to make my territory
for my worship--and worship it was, this soaking up of heat, this becoming one with the sky.

I walk to the point--slowly--observing-


Joyce is back. Three years ago, we met her with her husband at the weekly dance; other
couples left the floor to observe their wild exhibition; from the faces of the observers, they
felt joy and pleasure watching them; I felt fear and discomfort; for each time her husband&apos;s
pelvis tried to meet hers, she moved rapidly to one side laughing in his face; I feared for their
relationship and her cruelty. In another year they had separated, now they are divorced. She
is raising her young son, slight, beautiful, in love with his mother. I see them on the beach
at a distance. He is hacking away at a superman-size log with an axe; the beach reverberates
with his effort and his mother is watching. Is she seducing another male into sacrificing his
manhood? Is letting children wear out their capacity not a confirmation of their impotence?
She is beautiful and gay--but deadly.

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Afternoon


Two years ago the Howards started to build a new house. It looked like an all-year house.
Like many other people who have grown fond of this beach, they might retire here, planning
to finish their days here. The new house was going up snug against the old, looking more
substantial, with more amenities, yet strangely incongruous so close to the old one. A lean-to
that was twice as substantial as the leaned-on.


The new house was finished last winter; the old one is boarded up, vacant-looking. I hear
strange building noises coming from the Howard property until suddenly, this morning, as I
stroll by on the beach, the old house reveals itself as a naked shell with Bill Howard performing
a lethal dance of unbuilding. I watch it long and with fascination, his serious methodical action,
his face proclaiming a careful skillful worker--all in the service of unbuilding--undoing something
that once was whole, useful, and part of a way of life.


I am suddenly aware of the utter strangeness of such activity to me. True, what is being done
must be done; from the looks of the piles of lumber, windows, and doors, salvage is applied
so that use is preserved; no, I am not fighting this on the level of usefulness and need; rather

It occurred to me last night that journeys, like dreams, have manifest and latent content.
My book on teaching is obviously manifest--what was my latent content? Like a dream it
swirled in its own regulated discontinuities, like dreams it had meanings at many levels, like
dreams it tried to communicate to the dreamer.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later


I went to the South Island; I love to drive my little car--moving along the road with a responsive
road-sensitive vehicle is fun--except that at one of the steep hills some young boys careened
at me on the wrong side of the road and only a fast swerve and both our luck kept us apart
and alive.


A young fisherman going North for the summer gave me a "fish"--fish here means salmon; I wished
him luck--I looked at his boat--what an adventure to be for two to three months at Dixon
Inlet in a small boat in one&apos;s own company, praying for luck and usually hopelessly in debt
for the boat and provisions; what dream propels him on this journey.


Many dreams propelled me, but probably also real needs, needs to try out, to rehearse for some
of the living that is ahead; it may be that I do not trust myself with just living and I have to
rehearse it first; observe myself and even call in observers.

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Evening


When I returned from the South End I struggled with a difficult letter-difficult because it
meant so much to me that what I felt and thought would come through. The more important
clear communication is, the harder it seems to do: to find the words that express exactly what
one feels and know that at that, they still will mean something else to another person; to find
the gesture that your heart seeks and yet to know that the other person&apos;s symbols are different,
and that momentary fatigue, annoyance, rush, or preoccupations may further distort the
recipient&apos;s cognitive field, so when the signal is received, it has become further estranged
from the sender.

This is the day of the lowest tide; it seemed hours that the water waited far out and the
Straits looked empty, the mountains and Islands higher; suddenly the high tide-a 16-footer-
came surging to shore driven by an easterly that churned the sea and badgered it into whitecaps.
Masses of seaweed came on the waves, seaweed that probably lost its footing during the warm
drought of the long low tide; debris floated around, and the sea groaned and strained against
the rocks. I hurtled myself into the cataclysm, riding the waves, avoiding the debris, and enjoying
the turmoil, until I fell tired onto the warm shore. I had pumped 400 strokes to replenish my
bath water last night and my muscles were tired.


Later, to celebrate the weather I walked to the point. A little boy about five years old stopped
me and asked my name in a vacuous, mechanical fashion. He was one of a group of four children
busy with a pail at a tidepool. As I was looking at this group, trying to put this boy&apos;s overtly
friendly, yet so inappropriately distant demeanor in focus, a voice, resembling a steel rattle
called "Kids, come," then louder and somewhat plaintive "kids, come now" and then as she

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another, somewhat scraggy-looking eight-year-old girl was whimpering, washing her foot in a
puddle, while the fat woman-obviously their mother--shouted in the direction of no one in
particular, "Keep off that log, Annie burnt herself," and with an aside to me, needing to
include a passer-by in the action, said, "creosote" in a stage whisper. As she was explaining,
the littlest of the original group, a girl probably age three, was rushing towards the offending
log, getting her mother into a run, to scoop her up and hit her hard across her backside. The
child&apos;s face stayed immobile holding her wide-eyed stare, not defending herself, instead
snuggling into that massive maternal body which accepted this overture momentarily and then
virtually flung her back down.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As soon as this had been accomplished, the mother resumed a shouting diatribe addressed to
her children as a herd rather than as individuals, reciting how often she had had to call, indeed
had to shout, had lunch ready and would not care to remind them further to come; the children
followed her in a desultory fashion as they clambered up to their tent.


I felt pain, pain at the bizarre violation of human beings, at the empty, angry life of this mother,
at the bland anger and despair growing inside these children. Slowly my pain turned to anger too,
this type of anger breeds anger--anger at ourselves who cannot and have not found ways to
mitigate this emotional rape of children--this stunting of soul, this attrition of feeling, this
diminution of humanity.

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now I am looking down into the crystal-clear water below the rock ledge. The tide has moved in
and where I walked three hours ago are now three feet of water. The water is calm now.


Incredulously I peer down, at first doubting my vision, then my perceptions as to what I see
there as I cannot in any way relate to what I saw and felt underfoot only three hours ago;
there are tall-weaving stalks of brown kelp, vivid meadows of two-inch high green algae, also
a number of sea animals that had not been here a while ago. These, however, I assume swam
in, arriving with the fullness of the water. The kelp and algae though, had been here, though
completely distorted by being dry and flattened. The shapes of the plants moving below in
the water contained the shape of dehydrated plants--yet none of my senses, neither sight nor
touch, were trained to encompass both the potential as well as the manifest shape within
sensory reach.


The poverty of our imagination, the poverty of foresight, and roletaking is partly based on
this deficiency in perception. The total tyranny of the present over our senses leaves yesterday
and tomorrow to be governed by our imagination.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Were our senses more open to perceiving, not only the manifest but also the latent shapes,
we would be more understanding of the world around us. Now, with our senses bound to the
immediately manifest, only creativity or insanity endow them with seeing the potential image;
neither of these modes contain the full safeguards needed to test reality.


Yet at the same time I am aware of the need for specific patterns, reality-bound, clear and
redundant. The need for and at the same time the enjoyment of patterns haunt me. How do
these patterns arise? In the severely dysfunctional child or adult, the world appears to be devoid
of form or governed by such different forms that we are unable to perceive them. My work with
severely dysfunctional children involves the provision of external patterns when the "normal"
internal patterns fail to provide adequate messages to cope with basic social demands. As we
provide patterns to their lives, patterns of time, of space, of tactile shapes, and of sound, their
ability to navigate through their days appears to steady them, and then their mood seems less
tense and panicked. At the same time, their previous need to preserve sameness, where change
was greeted with anguished tempers, decreases, and the child can dare, try, and venture.

Man seems to need triangulation points to tell the tall from the taller, the distant from the near,
and the long past from the recent; he needs mental structures, minute as well as sweepingly
large patterns, from which to sense, perceive, and judge. When there is a failure of patterns,
or an absence or shifting of his orientation points, he becomes anguished, confused, and
fearstricken. This occurs both in the absence of as well as in the noncongruence between
patterns or benchmarks. When the information obtained is ambivalent, when signposts point
in more than one direction at once, the organism becomes confused and anxious. The dilemma
must be resolved, however; none of the possible results allow comfort or closure-the organism
may remain immobilized, thus avoiding a choice, pick one alternative without experiencing a
clearly mandated choice, or blindly escape, somehow hurtling along one or the other escape
route, devoid of autonomous decisions.


When the pilot, the steering signal, becomes inoperative, the helmsman flounders and despairs.

CBU plays music of four centuries each morning between six and 10 a.m. The day starts with the
predictable measures, rhythms and tonal architecture of 17th and 18th century music, moves
through "classical selections" to the atonal and dissonant music of today. At least this is the
overall impression. As I listen more closely there are dissonant strains in the early music; passages
of disciplined counterpoint, fugues, and melodic runs emerge from the "modern" music. Detail
changes the global impression as careful experience allows me to find the communalities in many
experiences and in the formal presentation of this experience, as attention enriches detail and
points up yet greater diversity. The expressions of feelings and the casting of them into patterns
to lock them in time and space were probably first done to make them accessible to the self of
the artist, and only secondarily to communicate them to others.


Always I had enjoyed Brown&apos;s little front garden, full of colorful flowers; I saw Mr. B. in the
window, waved, and he came out. I told him how much I had always enjoyed their flowers, so
much that I had loitered at the fence. His face brightened and he thanked me profusely; why don&apos;t
we express pleasure to others more often?


The sun is within 10 minutes of vanishing into the high tide, there is a Mozart piano concerto on
the radio, the sea has quieted--it seems to quiet at that hour so often-there is a prayer somewhere,
an inarticulate wish for more goodness and concern, for more care, informed care, and allowing
more pleasure to be felt.

Later


When I sat at the high tide line, the rocks were alive with insects, jumping, teeming, at places with
layers of them; the unusual high water had them displaced; there was a feeling of panic about them--
a crush of homeless populations.


Man is about to be engulfed in such a tide; the point of no return may yet have to come or it may
have been passed. How if it has not, can we open the human heart to informed caring about itself
and about its neighbor so that a "human" man may remain to populate this island that is earth?
The archetypical humanity with hate and anger, with cannibalistic and incestuous drives, is also the
humanity that knows wisdom and art, love and concern, and the enjoyment of the senses!


Now the high tide is turning--no longer are the big tree trunks battering and thrown against the
shore; they have less force and the ones in the shallowest water slow down in their wild dance to
rest more often until they are again wedged on solid ground.

[p. <i>106</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00104&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many relationships are this way. The closer they are the more open to the turmoil of high tides,
the greater the cataclysm and the more subtle the remission of turmoil--so very subtle that the
participants often are unable to say when the tide turned, even less, what made it turn.


At times even the repetition fails to convey the message. Some relationships are so close and
mirror the partners&apos; feelings with such fidelity that their turmoils must occur when both are most
vulnerable, low in all their life energies, almost as to assure a crisis. Like the attraction of the moon,
the low ebb of life forces and precipitates the high tide of turmoil leaving both partners feeling
helplessly cast adrift. As with the tide, later the turmoil subsides into ignorant calm.

Later


Perhaps this journal might be called "Midcentury Journal"--<i>my</i> midcentury. Perhaps a combination
of hormonal changes and emotional-stage needs have converged to make this a special year, special
like adolescence and bearing one&apos;s first child: with needs to sum up, to find direction, and heighten
understandings.


So much that is new and different has emerged for me, a heightened sensuality and sexuality with
a strange quality that expects gratification much more predictably than previously; it seems that I
feared lack of fulfillment from my senses--now I find them reliable companions that will sustain me.


I have dared more--not because I am braver-I am afraid. But probably because age says that
"waiting" for chances is an illusion. I have made more friends and enemies. I think I am being seen
more tactless, more angry, more loving, and supporting in turn. At one point I allowed myself to
feel the possible death of part of me, to wait for once and hope, to face rather than manipulate.


It has been a time to give up or try to give up some dreams: it became unrealistic to expect that
the many dreams of becoming, that I had cherished could come true--I would not become a
neurophysiologist, I would not obtain training as a neurologist, I would never be a major poet, as
little as I would be a ballerina; I would never wake up and be beautiful, and strangely enough, this

[p. <i>108</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00106&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Is there a time when we communicate with others without fulfilling some need within us? Is there
truly altruistic communion? But then, does it really matter?


Whether we couple with body or soul-we respond to needs of complementarity and stimulation,
whether we provide solace, administer discipline, give information, lecture, badger, persuade, or
implore--we are following the mandate of our needs.


What is the nature of human intercourse? It cannot ever be selfless, as it derives from the self and
its passions; but it can be less manipulative, demanding, and imposing, by letting the personal needs
be attenuated in internal dialogue, and in activities which are less directly demanding of others.

[p. <i>109</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00107&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We can go long and far on an intensive guilt trip as we look at the egomaniacal qualities within
us, or we can acquaint ourselves better with this egomaniac. We can accept him as he is, as the
only framework available to us in which we relate, as we accept the shape of the kelp, the turn
of the tide, and the thrust of the winds. If we fritter away our energies in cursing the origin of
this, our private universe, we remain trapped and removed from the very presence of others,
if we move out as we say, "this is me," we can touch others and others can touch us in those
human ways that our patterns of being permit. Strangely, as we affirm our self-needs and become
aware of the small distance that we <i>are</i> able to travel socially, this space appears larger, more
open, and filled with a vast number of ways in which we can experience others.


As the passions of having to become, of having to arrive, of needing answers and quick solace have
receded, my self changed--allowing many others to touch me and I becoming able to touch
them in a more gentle sustained manner.

[p. <i>110</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00108&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

While most dreams have diminished in scope, my dream for personal closeness has grown--
I think I am learning more about friendship.


Still, I doubt that I could just <i>be</i> and settle only for the possible--I need dreams that are bigger
than I am, I need to yearn, I need to be part of wonder and beauty, and discovery--though I
may never be one of them.


The unremitting and unrefusable quest for discovery is in part my drive to discover; the "need"
to search, the human mandate to "have," to finish unfinished business is greater and beyond a
wanted or willed search. The searches we must go on are those whose inner imperative drives
us for closure where unfulfilled patterns of experience activate travel, travel of waking and
dreaming, action and inaction, and those that lead us to find or to forsake companions.


Once I thought that mourning could be avoided, postponed, shortened or scheduled. No, it
might be closer to the truth to say that I had not troubled myself much about mourning and
that I had assumed that "intelligent people like I" could handle losses in an easy matter-of-fact way.


Just beyond the threshold of childhood I came to love deeply, yet remotely. Alex was more
than three times my age and as a traveling journalist, away most of the time. His brief visits at

[p. <i>111</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00109&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The outbreak of the war separated us completely and I heard by rumor that Alex had landed in
a starvation war camp, his chances for survival very small. No record of either his death or
survival could be found, after the war, and in view of the history of this camp, his death would
have occurred with near certainty; furthermore, his lack of getting in touch with any of his
friends or colleagues, also made his death almost certain.


While I had hoped against hope that we would meet again, over the war years I had "accepted" the
fact that he was gone and turned to my growing up, leaving this past behind me. At times I
would mention something about him, vaguely enjoying the thought but by and large I had
put him "out of my mind."

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00110&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Twenty odd years later, at a ballet performance I suddenly began to cry, unaccountably, it
seemed, and my sadness persisted for the next few days. Only some strenuous dreamwork
uncovered my sadness: the last time after I had seen Alex, I had gone to the movies seeing
this same ballet. The music, over more than twenty years, served to recall my feelings, the
sense of unfinishedness, the incompleteness and loss. A period of active, involved mourning
followed-had to follow, which returned a great deal of hidden feeling and capacity to love,
share, and respond.


Since experiencing this, I have given much greater attention to the need to mourn, helping
people to look at endings and to beginnings, to re-experience the feeling of loss, dread, fear,
and often anger at being left; I have pointed to anniversaries as times when many such feelings
become remobilized, and have attempted to help and support when the work was very rough.
Rough it is always, and only in denial can it be lightened, though remaining ahead, as a task
yet to be done.


Uncompleted mourning leaves a trail of wounds that heal over only superficially but are hollow
with empty unfilled spaces. Often the so-called fully expected death, where someone was bound
to die and the people around him felt that they had taken leave, will seemingly make griefwork
unnecessary. Yet, the finality of someone being gone must still be worked through; perhaps
leave of the formerly healthy, viable person had been taken, but leave must also be taken of the
individual, of the entity, the person; the letting someone be nothing, totally irrecoverable, must
be underlined. Failing this, a ghost remains to haunt the one who did not mourn.

I made a fire this morning--when one has to carry one&apos;s own wood, one thinks and plans-but how
wonderful the lapping flames, the patterns of interaction; each piece, the smallest and the largest
are part of this fire. The ones that burn brightly as well as the ones that wish to be incombustible--
the behavior of each of them contributes to the uniqueness of "this" fire--but as I say "this"
fire, it is already a new one as the particles have changed and so have the observer&apos;s. Panta rhei--
perhaps illusion of awareness and knowledge is what gives us the solace of continuity--the
comforting illusion of Being.


When I designed the cabin I placed the fire where it could be seen from bed. I went back to listen
to the Brahms double concerto and meditate on the fire--an immeasurable bliss overcame me as the
limp body could rest while eyes and ears feasted-the ultimate hedonism! The odor of burning fir
and cedar was my perfume-that perfume bringing to the senses primal delights, like salt air, pine
needles, or the muskiness of jasmine of a summer night.


This interaction of body and environment is the prototype of positive symbiosis-the elemental
interaction of the body with its surroundings, the taking-in of signals is pleasurable as such.

[p. <i>117</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00115&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There is a certain circularity in me. I have often wanted to overcome. A difficulty in saying
goodbye, in making final decisions, in closing doors and drawers. Somehow this has to do with my fear
of finality, of death, or getting to a point of no return. While I am lunging toward becoming, I am
unable to relinquish the base from where I came; and I am so slow in burying anything of myself--
this is what makes changing so hard. I can see what I do wrong and still repeat: am I deluding
myself to think that in spite of this I do move?


Still, this week, as I tried to present an interactional pattern framework for my book, I constantly
returned to my awareness that everything is finite but that we just do not have the tools to prove it;
there is a finite number of grains of sand, of rocks, of water, of oxygen, and that man&apos;s delusion
of unlimited resources are just a security operation in hopes for an endless supply. It is realistic
for us to acknowledge that we have so much love to give, so much time to do, so much strength to
cope--the concept of limitedness is a good antidote to omnipotence and its ultimate disillusions
and self-punishment. One can wonder and still worship the finite-the finite as a pattern of shifting
relationships is so vast that it can command the same awe that only the infinite elicited in primitive
man. The pattern and the schema-the concept of the model which reduplicates but still has a
built-in freedom for mutation can fill us with the same adoration that the supernatural used to
command.

I feel that my journey is drawing to a close; this kind of journey does not have a clear destination--
just feelings of having come to a way station. It will be a long time until these images turn into
well-known album pages--they are still living and changing--but they provide triangulation points
in my search through life.


On foot over mountains and valleys one loses sight of them but recalls their approximate location
from an internal scheme; then when rising to heights, one sights them again and reconfirms the
inner symbol. I now see more of these points, they will fade away and re-emerge--they will provide
the shifting clarity that guides me along circuitous paths.

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00117&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later<br />
Beach walk


The child-like physical mastery of being upright, strong and surefooted, the finding paths through
chaos, new paths as skiing on virgin slopes, that used to exhilarate me! How simply mastery needs
can be met, how joyous they are! Many different muscles come into play, weight shifts as one
tilts in various angles against gravity-a feeling of kinaesthetic exploration fills one with buoyancy.
The overworked "happiness is..." applies. We lose so much in our daily lives, not letting these
experiences intrude into our businesses, our preoccupations with goals, our oughts and have to&apos;s.
It seems that my sense of self is so closely tied to these elemental experiences, that my real sense of
worth is in these basic masteries, and that joys are more immediate and more completely consummated
when they are so tangible and close.


It somehow annoys me when today&apos;s young extol sensory experience as if they invented it, just
to recall that I too felt that no one had ever known or felt what I felt. In actuality, it is probably
not any generation, but each individual whose neuronal paths must open to novel synapses, novel for
his own body, new for his own life; and it may be the <i>act</i> of experiencing, of building new
connections, that feels so unique--not the experience itself. What the new young are bringing to us
is a renewed freedom to look at these sensations. The "Victorians" made them appear covert and
unclean, appropriate only to poets and madmen. In their zeal to share, the sin of overstatement,
shrillness, and banality emerges--but no worse than the voice of the huckster over the land.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00118&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Walt Disney was reputed to have said, "My belief is that there are more people in America who
want to smile than who want to be artistically depressed ..." This is a sentiment quite typical
for the Babbitt of my generation; the young are trying to acknowledge what "is" more openly;
however, having been raised by Walt Disneys, they found not-denying and not-repressing, they found
what stared them in the face was more soul-wrenching than they had been prepared for; I believe
that the flight into drugs is a compromise between trying to be honest and being unable to bear
this honesty and awareness. Thus, they prefer to look at the reality of a drug-induced Mandala,
the sounds of neural harmonies responsive to psychoactive herbs, and experience sex, "as if,"
attenuated by their knowledge that they are not "really themselves." It is "our" generation that
helped make this one!


Somehow, in writing my book, in becoming involved in teaching--my major theme is: how can
I help people to reduce their need to deny suffering and hurt, so that they can be more ready to
attenuate hurt around them? How can one strengthen people to allow more compassion, more
seeing, feeling, and hearing? We must create more secondary goals to recharge needs, to increase
supplies, to create human supports for supporters, and empathy for the empathic. A caring heart
needs a heart to care and visions to sustain courage!

11:00 p.m.


My house contains friends well. I had Eric and Jane over and we had a wonderful, leisurely
conversational dinner-the cabin does help the real meeting of people! I went to the beach after
they left and there was still enough light in the sky to see the logs and climb around. The navigation
lights and the lighthouse are sending out beams, communications of guidance and succor--the
kind of lights that all of us should be sending.


I am weeping now, slowly, softly, to mourn the passing of 200 special hours of my life--200 hours
of discoveries, small evanescent discoveries and bold patterns of living, of trying out modes of
feelings, of thinking, of behaving, from whimsy to tragedy, from poetry to expository prose,
from taking in to giving out, and from despair to ecstasy. As any journey of discovery--much
remains undiscovered, much more indeed. Still, this was an important journey-it renewed me
and returned me to old images whose glow illuminates my present. Camus said, "A man&apos;s work
is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great
and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened." These are the images of awe, trust,
or fear-that which is occult to childhood, one&apos;s tribal totems and taboos, one&apos;s sources of loves
and hates.

I came closer to these this time--I must now return to the other shore where the primal images
are farther and the demands of a present louder; but as each time before, my vision of the far
bank will be keener from my knowledge of what I saw and having been a traveler there.


I have met my strength to care for myself, experienced an infinitesimal sample of self-sufficiency,
enough to let me be dependent and interdependent with new assurance; I could abandon myself
to the sun and the night, and challenge the wind and the tide like a trembling adolescent. I could
run. laugh, and weep, and furiously work in a frenzied outpouring. I wrote some poems, and
sang myself songs. I was without time limits and changed my circadian rhythm at will--I was
free to be, to go back or to go forward, and I found some more richness and depth, more strength
and more power in my soul.

Tuesday, July 1


This is a turning point--today seems like a first day: everything is new, my rhythm of sleep and my
rhythm of awakening--doing rather than reflecting; integrative rather than analytic. This is a
beautiful day with a dry wind--this may contribute to my brisk mood--also the advent of a changing
life. I am regretful now--the searches in my depths were welcome, in spite of all the active trying
out, the fear and the pain represented a moratorium.


My night was filled with dreams about others, others about whom I care and have responsibility-while
dreams when they came before were about me, they have changed now into <i>their</i> focus.

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00122&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Later


I am cleaning the upstairs in anticipation of H. and my family arriving--this labor is part of the
summing up and I am doing the kind of menial simple things that the maids of my childhood did
before the advent of the vacuum cleaner--such as hanging pillows and carpets on the line and beating
the dust out of them. All this points to an ending.


As I picked up my bedroom, I opened the <i>Poetry of the Forties</i> anthology again and reread the
Spender poem, "June 1940," which seemed so evocative the night I arrived and unpacked my books.
Spender was the poet of my growing-up years--my awareness and externalized terrors were also
his--the rise of fascism, the massacre of Spain, the approaching cataclysm. Still, as I reread the
strophe that had caught my intensive responsiveness that far away Friday night, how it foreshadowed
my feeling about cold and desolation; if my unconscious had been listening to what it was ready to
respond (or did Spender evoke?) I will never know.

<i>I am cold as a cold world alone<br />
Voyaging through space without faith or aim<br />
And no Star whose rays point to a Cross to believe in,<br />
And an endless, empty need to atone</i>.


The "atone" plays on a deeply urgent, anxious cord I can still not reach-it lies in the realm of
elemental guilt. It feels as if it needed a deeply archaic canvas of violence and death: needs for
atonement without remorse. There is always a more distant myth to search-Persephone&apos;s wandering
is endless!

as sadness touched me opening a cleft<br />
of fatal loss to sear my soul, and burn<br />
deep in my fate an earthen urn<br />
phantasy-filled: named "I"! Bereft<br />
of you I wandered far! How deft<br />
to comfort were you? Your return<br />
though illusory I had cast<br />
into a certainty to still my pain<br />
nurt&apos;ring this figment I had built to last<br />
to make me wander witless, having lain<br />
with others like you, to replay a past<br />
I had invoked so often, yet in vain!</i>


<i>Remembrances of passions past remain<br />
deep in my loins as of a churning sea<br />
beholden to a moon whose apogee<br />
is hell. This brute refrain,<br />
an endless, hollow echo must proclaim<br />
my repetitious grief. Gates as of filigree<br />
wrought of past pleasures mock me as a key<br />
to palaces whose doors are ever-locked. In vain<br />
I seek this phantom I pretend has called<br />
for me, the actor in this tawdry plot<br />
of endless seeking, writ enthralled<br />
by one like you but alien. I forgot<br />
your real face and am again appalled<br />
when where I saw you find an empty spot</i>.

<i>Call me no more, this pageant must now end!<br />
these ghosts must leave! the play must be!<br />
Too long have I been, on this Odyssey<br />
and on I must, as I feel old and spent!<br />
How brave these words, how true; and still not free<br />
from you I am who can alone not fend<br />
for by myself; indeed I will not tend<br />
to just my life without your company!<br />
"I will be trapped, my friend, then in this hell<br />
full of mirages as a phantom spring!"<br />
Be it that I could see you and could tell<br />
you now what erstwhile I could sing<br />
only in secret chants but dared not spell<br />
as truths that I refused to you to bring!</i>


<i>For dusty decades I served at your shrine<br />
an acolyte who prayed with unshed tears<br />
as I did honor you with lust and fears<br />
with incantations spoken over wine<br />
to numb my senses; yet the brine<br />
of sadness and despair preempts my tears<br />
that are as yet unshed as panic sears<br />
my nights and days. Thus my design<br />
to mourn instead! should I still find your grave<br />
I may yet speak my prayers, not to pray,<br />
I may yet shed my tears, not cry a slave<br />
to mere imagined grief. I shall display<br />
my truest sense of loss and shout and rave<br />
knowing you left, but I had wished to stay!</i>

<i>Lend me your power so that I may change<br />
this repetitious chant to newer song,<br />
that I may sing of futures, ere too long<br />
these pasts will smother us.&apos; I range<br />
from phantasy to more phantastic dreams:<br />
away from looking back to whirling free<br />
into a future I begin to see<br />
quite dim, still distant, and whose magic themes<br />
I barely fathom:... now these scenes come clear,<br />
how strange they are with their familiar shapes,<br />
how they assume the aspects of those dear<br />
of earlier days; the swirling drapes<br />
of these dream figures, suddenly quite near<br />
envelop me once more with primal fear!</i>


<i>As I regain my selves, as potsherds lie<br />
on an abandoned grave or domicile<br />
of ancient man whose pasts I must revile<br />
as alien to my past, I vie<br />
with memories I can&apos;t &apos;surrect anon:<br />
those I take pride in, as they show me wise,<br />
those that have served me well; I must despise<br />
those empty eons that dragged on and on!<br />
Seeing these potsherds of vacated times<br />
tell of the futile lives that have been spent--<br />
to sow, to reap, to live amidst the crimes<br />
of lonely desperation, I am rent<br />
by melancholy and the deft defeat that primes<br />
repeated pasts; I will but can&apos;t prevent</i>.

<i>Let us imagine then ..." again entrapped<br />
in phantasy I am, "but let us be<br />
together in this dream so you and me<br />
are given license!" I am sapped<br />
by craving truths that I was never taught,<br />
by hopes for endings that I still must fear,<br />
by losing phantoms that I still hold dear,<br />
by having dreams I lived by come to naught!</i>


<i>"But did I see you smile within my dream<br />
a smile I must myself have wrought?<br />
Perchance, am I beholden to a theme<br />
of everending quests which I have sought<br />
with all there is of me?"--I ever seem<br />
to find, then flee what I had always fought</i>.


<i>I must remain then at this potter&apos;s field<br />
which holds the potsherds of my distant past<br />
as I must learn to live with what at last<br />
I know can&apos;t be reburied. Thus my yield<br />
of this strange harvest must a mourning be,<br />
as others learned that have come here before,<br />
as others learned who tried to shut this door<br />
that they must wander on their Odyssey,<br />
and must continue as their bell has tolled<br />
to make their prophecy remain fulfilled!<br />
Thus I must stay to gaze at what my urn: this mold,<br />
holds inexorably for me: both joy and guilt,<br />
pleasure and pain, and life and death enfold<br />
these fragments of my fate&apos;s preordered quilt</i>.

Thursday, July 3<br />
7:00 a.m.


My interlude is rapidly drawing to a close. My mood is triste, somehow passively sad, as if it contained
the seed of nostalgia already. I spent yesterday slowly putting my house in order--probably my
inner house, too; but the cabin is ready for sharing now, and I rehearsed the smile on my face,
the pleasant greeting, the watching for clues in faces and necks, the role of the hostess, this relating
to the edges of people. And I wonder how H. will have weathered the strain of his work and the
company without me, too; and I rehearsed restitution until I saw how false this was. Still, even after
thirty years, I cannot just be--actually not with any one--certainly not with distant people, while
the danger of hurting or losing close ones is ever present. Whether this is true for others or just
part of me, I do not know. Perhaps only the lunatic has the luxury of really being himself and we
punish him most gravely in addition to his profound suffering.

Later, when I may again feel this nostalgia, I hope it will not be for a period of paradise or one of
unadulterated bliss; I hope it will be for a short time where all of me, changeable and moody, wise and
foolish, trite and creative, maternal, feminine, androgynous, and male, could be and be heard by
me, when my creative impulses could run unobstructed, when I would dream by day, and reason
by night, when I could merge with nature, and submerge her to my reason in turn.


I hope that this interlude has created strengths in me that will nourish my love for H., my care of
my children, and helpful concern for E. I hope the same well feeds what therapeutic supplies I
have, as this helping, too, must spring from inner riches.


I am at the end of this journey through the experience of change. Many strange landscapes I visited,
yet they too, like more familiar territory, were of sand and rock and water and living things and
were but transformations of the previously known.


I can still remember the waving kelp forest--how different and new it was, though only a few hours
before, I had walked on this same kelp when it lay prostrate, never dreaming of this tall, waving,
underwater forest of tidal grasses.

[p. <i>132</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The change that I journeyed through, with joy at times, with trepidations at others, sometimes with
awe, then again with laughter, this, too, was of the same common fabric of my life: known to
itself, yet initially hidden from me; assuming different shapes as tides followed tides, now clinging
prostrate, now standing straight, now dancing able to stand against a wind, now tumbling within
the chaos of a storm.


If I could keep these images inviolate, in the knowledge that all life has always been present before
me. yet changed in movement and shape, I would be spared much fear and grief. If, from this
journey. I could retain the sense that I when changing, am only assuming different aspects of myself,
I could be spared much doubt and anguish. And if, upon my return, I can remember that this
journey, too. is part of the universe that contains my life, and of my life that contains the universe,
then the aloneness of my voyage will link me with the existence of others.

Later


I swam; the sea is still churned by an easterly and I let it play me, for once being, rather than
becoming; I did not submit, I did not fight, I "was" with the sea letting me experience it--how
hard it is to live the "is" rather than the "ought" or "will be" mode. There is a point for me in
orgasm that "is" where I am no longer an actor, where I am not an observer, but where elemental
sexuality becomes the experiencing me. From listening to some others, this may be the experience
that many fear--to them it means a giving up of self, to me it is transformation or perhaps
manifestation of a part that is ever present but beyond reach much of the time.


I have the rare fortune to have both love and loving, to have a spouse, a rare human being, brilliant,
sensitive, able to give and to receive love. This journey, my inner and outer permission to depart,
would not have been without my life with him; without his compassion and still letting me free,
without his humor and still letting me be serious about myself, without his sense of personal
adventure and still giving me room for mine, without his physical love and tenderness, and his
spiritual concern and care. It is to him that I dedicate this journal of a journey into personal
awareness, into the myths of my past, the ghosts of my presence, the feelings of my body and the
joys and agonies of my soul.


A few years ago, in my mid-forties, I felt the urge to start re-evaluating, trying to sharpen an
awareness of self, and to emerge to looking at the second half of life. I wrote an essay on change,

[p. <i>134</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000652260-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Change does not bring goals--there are no goals in life, just some benchmarks which probably
become defined through subsequent content--but there are times when a moratorium of living
can serve the self to try out roles, to let feelings go deep enough to fulfill their joys or their
agonies without having to be attenuated for pressing day-to-day business. When I wrote my
Essay on Change I did not expect sudden or great change, commanding visions, or conversion
revivals; change takes place imperceptibly, perhaps in a greater capacity to experience awe, to
be gentler and to honor the needs of others more readily. I will never "know" a purpose but I
will continue to seek my own. I know better now than when young, how love can nourish and
how hate can maim. I know better now that archaic images are but images, and that letting them
come to us will bring greater freedoms!


Each life has translucent moments of beauty and clarity when two souls briefly meet in communion,
when the ecstatic beauty of nature unfolds, when we create, and even when we despair. The times
when we are truly human are the benchmarks of living when we can fully rejoice or fully mourn,
when we can fully love or fully hate, when we are of life, and truth, and being.


I am about to leave this island now--leaving my island home for a long winter. I called up Eric to get
firewood to have it season so it can burn bright next year ....
