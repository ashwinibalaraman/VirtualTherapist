I returned to New York and got myself an apartment in Brooklyn
Heights. My brother had married.


I went to the employment agencies and without undue difficulty
got myself another job as security analyst, with a brokerage
house on Broadway, specializing in steel and leisure-time-activity
stocks, which were enjoying an upswing in the market.


Within four months I was back in the hospital, through an
exact repetition of circumstancesâ€”job pressures combined with
getting involved with a girl.


Everything seemed to go well at first. I got accustomed to my
job and began to familiarize myself with the steel industry. I got
to know the other members of the research department. The
company's activities, of course, were in brokerage. Their business
was done on volume of shares turned over; and their research
was not so elaborate, careful, or long-term as that in a commercial
bank. (This is true of most brokerage houses.) There was no
economist who worked with the research department, as we'd
had at the bank.)


In addition, our research was more immediately connected with
the needs of the customers' men (now called registered representatives
or, more impressively, account executives). We would get
requests for off-the-cuff opinions on companies for them. In the
beginning I enjoyed it; and I became acquainted with the board
room, some of the customers' men, and one or two of the partners.


At the same time I began to consort with a girl in Boston.
Charlotte Miller had been at Vassar and was a friend of my
brother's wife. She was a big, tall girl and an excellent tennis

We played tennis at the Brookline Country Club. She could
beat me, usually by scores of about 6-3; but I always enjoyed it.
She was a superb player, the only woman I've ever played with of
tournament caliber. She loved the game even more than I did; put
on few airs about it; and usually beat me with better shotmaking
and greater steadiness. I could find no weaknesses in her game,
and I don't believe I ever managed to take one set from her. (I
am an enthusiastic tennis player, of the weekend variety.)


I visited Charlotte a number of weekends, and we got more
serious about each other. The same pattern repeated itself. I became
suddenly disturbed, overcome by anxiety, and I began to
hallucinate again. In short, I fell seriously ill.


My symptoms began to become acute within the space of a
month. They again proceeded along two fronts: job-wise and
romance-wise.


On the job I grew increasingly dissatisfied. I asked for permission
not only to be a research analyst but also to become a customers'
man, so that I could have some accounts of my own. I
became in a tremendous hurry to rise. I was informed that the
company's organization did not permit people to be both in
research and in customer service.


A couple of weeks later I went to one of the partners and
asked him to more than double my salary, believing that I was
very valuable to the organization and well worth the increase.
And my behavior at work was getting a little strange.


With Charlotte my behavior was also strange. I telephoned her
persistently from my apartment, insisting that I had important
things to say to her, that she come to New York to visit me, and
otherwise behaved oddly. Charlotte became alarmed and wanted
to see less of me or perhaps break off entirely. Then I began to
hallucinate again.


I made a trip to Richmond, where Charlotte was, by airplane
and bus, believing it urgent that I see her. I had not calculated my
finances well and ran short of money. Charlotte and her family

My sister and brother had heard reports of me. They asked
me to visit my sister in Old Greenwich. I went. My brother was
present. Afterward the three of us drove in his car. I believed that
we were driving back to Brooklyn; instead they took me to West
Hill. They had tricked me.


But it took several minutes to sign me in as a voluntary patient.
I hated the idea of returning at all; and I particularly hated West
Hill. I had an active loathing for the place, and much preferred
the Institute. I waited in the car while my brother and sister talked
with the admitting staff. After a while two aids climbed into the
car with me, and my brother drove to the building where I was
to be a patient.


I was furious. I climbed out the side door and made a run for
it. I had not yet been officially admitted, and I succeeded unopposed
in getting off the hospital grounds. I had a dim realization
that my behavior was not normal, but at the same time considered
myself to be sufficiently rational. Once I was off the hospital
grounds, there was no way they could forcibly bring me back.


I hitch-hiked back to Brooklyn. My brother stopped his car
near me on the road and tried to persuade me to go to the hospital
for my own good; but I refused to speak to him. There was
nothing he could do, and he left. I got a ride, bummed subway
fare from the driver, and returned to my apartment.


I was at large for a couple of weeks after that and during that
time got into more and more trouble.


I quit my job and took a few days' vacation in Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands. I didn't realize it then (I never do when I
begin to fall seriously ill), but my behavior was gravely disturbed.
From Puerto Rico I sent Dr. Kalmus a telegram that showed how
disturbed I was. I believed that he was following me, had been
hired by my brother to trail me. I would sue him for malpractice

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084848-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After a few days, I returned to New York. I got into progressively
greater difficulties. I was living in an apartment alone and
had my middle-aged landlady on the floor below. A good amount
of my hallucinations and anxieties was sexual, and soon after my
return I visited the landlady's apartment. After she served me a
cup of coffee, I removed my clothes and tried to induce her to
make love to me. She was an experienced, liberal woman in her
forties. She didn't call the police; instead she finally persuaded me
to return to my apartment. Then she must have informed my
brother of my strange behavior, realizing that I was not acting
normally. At any rate my brother found out about the incident
and of course became more alarmed.


Next I visited my sister in Old Greenwich. I thought I could
get a rest that way and take stock. I stayed nearly a week.


My sister lived with her husband, an economist, in a group of
apartments with their two sons, aged seven and five. I slept
on a sofa in the living room.


One day I prowled around a neighboring housewife's back
door. I was hallucinating. My sister lived in one half of a double
house; and while she was out buying groceries, I stole to the other
half of the house, believing that Charlotte was concealed there.
A neighbor startled me just at the door. I made up a lame excuse.


My sister became more and more concerned and sent a psychiatrist
to visit me. I talked with him for half an hour and sent
him on his way, telling him I was perfectly well.


I was a disturbance to my sister and may have been a dangerous
influence on her children. She made frequent telephone calls
to my brother in New York. I was not violent, but my behavior
was disturbed. I was ill; there was no doubt about it.


I was informed that the psychiatrist had obtained a writ ordering
that I be hospitalized. I didn't believe it, however, and refused
to go unless I saw the writ with my own eyes. The writ was never
produced.


A day or two later my brother telephoned me in the evening.

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084848-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was sick at heart. I knew that I was disturbed but didn't think
I was ill enough to have to go to the hospital again. Still, I'd been
hallucinating badly for nearly three weeks and was absolutely at
the end of my resources. I honestly didn't know what to do. I
realized dimly that I was disturbing my sister's household, making
a nuisance of myself, and scaring the neighbors. The previous
night I'd had a hallucination that an umbrella left in the yard
had had some profound psychological significance.


With despondent heart I let them drive me to Hartford. I
realized during the drive that the two of them could overpower
me by force if necessary, and that made my feelings sink even
more. I thought of slipping out the side door at a red light but
didn't do it. I submitted with ill grace but without violence.


I describe this scene to show how ill I was; and because such
scenes often take place when mental patients are admitted to
hospitals. It is usually a family crisis. It is no pleasanter for the
family than it is for the patient. In loved ones it requires cool
heads, judgment, and plenty of self-control.


Here I would like to talk of an important point: that it required
four separate stays in the hospital before I finally learned
to take protective measures, specifically stellazine or thorazine
pills, once I'd recovered.


When I began to get ill again, instead of going promptly to
a psychiatrist, who might have been able to forestall the acute
stages of illness by putting me on tranquilizing drugs, I had a
tendency to avoid doctors like the plague, thinking I was well
enough to be on my own. When I begin to get ill, I think I can
take care of myself, and I actively avoid psychiatric help.


Quite a number of persons who become mentally ill are that
way. Yet it is vitally important to seek aid early. Had I visited
a psychiatrist early, I might have avoided my third hospitalization
entirely. But I was stubborn and independent, and allowed my

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084848-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After more than five years in mental hospitals, as I write this,
I do not see psychiatrists, but I do take tranquilizing drugs. I have
been taking them steadily for more than fourteen months.


I have finally learned to take a few precautionary measures.
I do not take tranquilizers for any immediate effects they have
on my behavior but as insurance against a recurrence.


It is easy and inexpensive to take a pill three times a day,
especially in contrast to the expense of being hospitalized, the
heartache, and the interruption of a career.


At Chestnut Lodge a doctor I talked with, a mature psychiatrist
with fifteen or twenty years of practice behind him, was
strongly in favor of this. He said he had several patients who had
been on tranquilizers without any acute symptoms and able to
live everyday lives for periods of up to eight years. He had one
patient, a middle-aged woman, who was always perfectly all right
as long as she stayed on pills, but every once in a while she would
try to cut down on the pills; and as soon as she did she would
begin again to receive ESP messages on TV, and her health would
deteriorate. The doctor's problem was to keep her regularly on
tranquilizers.


My own experience has been, in the fourteen months since
I've been out of hospitals and on tranquilizers, that my health and
morale have been uninterruptedly excellent. I have married, gotten
a lot of productive work done, and had a happy time.


I was admitted to the Institute on March 17, 1961, well after
midnight. I requested to go to an admitting unit for both men
and women and was allowed to do so. I was there a day or so
and then went to North 2. I was hallucinating, but of course the
controlled atmosphere prevented me from acting out.


Some hospitals have mixed units, some have separate units for
men and women. I, especially if I am quite ill, prefer a unit
entirely for men. When I am in acute stages of illness, I tend to
get into trouble with women, and though it may be more boring
to be on a men's unit, women who are quite ill can be nuisances.

Dr. Black was again my doctor. I was showing bad symptoms.
I was psychotic. I remember in my first days proposing marriage
to a student nurse after talking with her fifteen minutes. I left
my fly open. (Afterward I was shocked at my behavior. Since
then I have seen a number of patients do the same thing. It is
a common manifestation of serious, acute mental illness; but
plenty of patients can recover completely after having done such
things.)
