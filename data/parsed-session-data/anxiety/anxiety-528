BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b>	All right, I saw you on [DATE], exactly a month ago.
<b>PT:</b>	And you were going to, I didn't have to go back for two or three months, I think.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, three months.  Your mood was okay, you had some memory problems, your anxiety was under better control, your appetite was good, you were exercising, your sleep was fine, feeling depressed while you were sleeping, right?
<b>PT:</b>	I still—
<b>DR:</b>	Self esteem was okay, filing for divorce, not suicidal, not helpless or hopeless, very forward looking, all right, so we thought in the context of your depression and your generalized anxiety, you were in decent shape on your cocktail, on the 30 twice a day of BuSpar, 100 of Lamictal, 1 mg twice a day of Klonopin, so actually quite week on antidepressant, no antidepressant, just mood stabilizer and antianxiety.  All right, what has happened over this month?
<b>PT:</b>	I fell apart.
<b>DR:</b>	You unraveled, what happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Good word.
<b>DR:</b>	What happened?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the papers were all signed, I filed, my husband hasn't gotten the papers yet.
<b>DR:</b>	But you filed, you did the court part of it and so now someone has to serve him—
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	With papers.
<b>PT:</b>	I did all my paperwork.
<b>DR:</b>	Are you having second thoughts?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I'm just—
<b>DR:</b>	About what?
<b>PT:</b>	About my future, about not having enough money, being alone, even when [INAUDIBLE] already in all that crap, all the crap that's out there.
<b>DR:</b>	Any hits, any—
<b>PT:</b>	I've got dates already but that's not the point, the point is, another thing happened, my business partner met someone, she's been divorced.  She's been in a very codependent relationship, very codependent.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	It was an unhealthy codependence—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	That everybody had, over the years, said it was unhealthy.
<b>DR:</b>	What's the business you're in?
<b>PT:</b>	Advertising specialties, promotions, anything with a logo—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	We've been doing that for about twenty three years but we've always been in business together.  We met when, I think [NAME OTHER] was 5.  He had a lousy childhood, I had a lousy childhood, the group therapy, [NAME OTHER]—
<b>DR:</b>	With each other?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [NAME OTHER] was afraid of everything and her daughter was wetting the bed and we ended up in group, from there we became very good friends.
<b>DR:</b>	How many years was it then?
<b>PT:</b>	About twenty.
<b>DR:</b>	It was sexual for twenty, so it was a real relationship.
<b>PT:</b>	A real relationship and it wasn't good for me.
<b>DR:</b>	Why not?
<b>PT:</b>	Too controlling, I could never—
<b>DR:</b>	Were you very much in love?
<b>PT:</b>	At the beginning, yeah, I would say for at least fifteen years and she wanted more and I didn't want to give her more.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean she wanted more, what more could you give her?
<b>PT:</b>	She wanted to live together and come out.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, and you would divorce your husband and—
<b>PT:</b>	Be with her.
<b>DR:</b>	And be with her, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	And I decided no, not because of coming out or anything, I just couldn't, she just had to control everything, she controls her—
<b>DR:</b>	So she's a bit of a difficult person?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Rigid?
<b>PT:</b>	Not that I'm a pleasure but she's very—
<b>DR:</b>	Is she anxious?
<b>PT:</b>	No, just nasty.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	No, if you don't get your own way you get nasty.  Even in, I just give in, even in the office, it's okay, it's not worth it—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And that's what the relationship became, it's not worth the arguing—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	Just let it go.
<b>DR:</b>	So you'd give in all the time for everything—
<b>PT:</b>	It's easier.
<b>DR:</b>	Because she's more hysterical than I've ever been?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, she's not hysterical, she's just, she doesn't get hysterical, she's just, it's my way.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, so—
<b>PT:</b>	She doesn't yell anymore.  She used to yell.
<b>DR:</b>	And is the business successful?
<b>PT:</b>	The business, I'm on disability, the business has not really been successful for about maybe five years and I wanted to close it, she didn't, so what I did was I back dated the disability because I had back pain for a long time—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So I back dated the disability probably about a year and a half which I had the medical records to do that and I've been taking disability ever since, so—
<b>DR:</b>	Then to take disability, does the business have to continue to exist?
<b>PT:</b>	The business does exist and pays her a salary.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, but does it have to for you to continue to get disability?
<b>PT:</b>	Probably, I don't, and the thing is we've sold land, we made bad investments in [DEIDENTIFIED], got back part of the money so if we pay off all the debt and I actually could come back and it could just, just support us, I mean maybe about $5000 or $6000 a month, which is—
<b>DR:</b>	And didn't—
<b>PT:</b>	And I'm making, I get like $3400 in disability so what I would like to—
<b>DR:</b>	Is the hope in the back of your mind to get, leaving your husband to get back together with her?  You don't want this to be a relationship?
<b>PT:</b>	No, but none of this makes sense because I just felt that I helped her through divorce, I gave her money for her divorce.  At that time, I had an inheritance so I gave her everything she needed, I got her through it financially, physically, and emotionally and now I'm going to get a divorce and she mets somebody with a gazillion dollars and she's gone and I'll be alone.
<b>DR:</b>	She's gone where?
<b>PT:</b>	She's probably going to end up with him.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, he's, and I don't get that either, he lost his wife three months ago, they're like four cousins, third or fourth cousins, he walked in her mother's house and said you are for me and that was it.  Do people do that after three months and a forty five year marriage?
<b>DR:</b>	That's a bit odd.
<b>PT:</b>	Because I spoke to this guy on the phone that I have a date with and it took him six years to be able to go out with somebody—
<b>DR:</b>	Well, people are different—
<b>PT:</b>	Because he got so lonely.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, people are different but this guy, it's pretty—
<b>PT:</b>	My sister did it with her, with her person that she's been living with fourteen years, his marriage was over, I mean his wife had died three months ago but he had taken care of her for thirty five years, she was sick.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, so he was primed to bury her.
<b>PT:</b>	He needed, needed to have fun and my sister is whacked out and has energy for five people and that's what he needed after thirty five years.  This man had a wonderful marriage for like forty two years, they were sweethearts as he put it, she had breast cancer like five years ago then went into remission and then was very sick for a year and it's three months and he's ready to move in with [NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.
<b>PT:</b>	Maybe that's—
<b>DR:</b>	So you're feeling a little abandoned?
<b>PT:</b>	Exactly.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, well, that's pretty normal.
<b>PT:</b>	It's normal?
<b>DR:</b>	It's normal, are you kidding.
<b>PT:</b>	My psychotherapist says—
<b>DR:</b>	Of course you're feeling lousy.
<b>PT:</b>	Doesn't think so.  He thinks it's a good thing because it was too codependent and do you know that in [DEIDENTIFIED] there is no CoDA, you know, for codependency, nothing, they have a gay and lesbian one which I don't even think I am because that was just, we needed each other, it was just there and we needed each other and it happened and I've been looking for CoDA, I've been looking for any kind of, there's no—
<b>DR:</b>	How about psychotherapy?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm in psychotherapy three days a week.
<b>DR:</b>	Shouldn't that cover you?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, it is but it's, it's the abandon, he feels it's the abandonment of my mother and father when I was very little and I've feeling abandonment again.  What I'm feeling isn't logical, it's all—
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean it's not logical, it couldn't be more normal?
<b>PT:</b>	I feel like somebody is sitting on my chest.  The fear from the divorce and I know, all the sudden my life, the stockmarket goes in the crapper so my money is going to be less, I can't sell my house because you can't give them away and it's going to go down in value and everything is very—
<b>DR:</b>	Your best friend and partner has abandoned you for someone else.
<b>PT:</b>	But she really hasn't abandoned me as a friend.
<b>DR:</b>	Right and it's—
<b>PT:</b>	I will never—
<b>DR:</b>	And it's quite appropriate that she move on with her life and—
<b>PT:</b>	I'm not—
<b>DR:</b>	And her own happiness.
<b>PT:</b>	That part doesn't bother me.
<b>DR:</b>	And develop a codependent relationship with someone else.
<b>PT:</b>	But that part doesn't bother me because I know she'll always be my friend, not in the same way, I guess it does bother me.  I doesn't bother me that she's going to be happy, it bothers me that she's not going to be there the same way I was going to be there, I was there for her.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	You know, and I'm angry about that.
<b>DR:</b>	That's pretty normal to me.
<b>PT:</b>	Well then why do I have to have Klonopin all day just to get through the day?
<b>DR:</b>	You don't have to.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, then I just can't—
<b>DR:</b>	You'd just be paralyzed with anxiety.
<b>PT:</b>	Paralyzed, totally paralyzed, my whole body is paralyzed, that's why I'm here because I can't—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you anxious all day every day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	And do you feel like you've fallen into a depression again?  Are you sad all the time?
<b>PT:</b>	If you talk to me, I start crying but I don't know if it's depression, I'm upset, is being upset different than a depression?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, this is like bereavement, this is like a death, it's a loss—
<b>PT:</b>	It's a loss.
<b>DR:</b>	Of a relationship.
<b>PT:</b>	It's a loss, even the divorce is a loss.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	And change.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And I hate change.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right, so transitions are [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b>	Well, even that, you can't find a group of woman in transition either in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I don't know how backwards [DEIDENTIFIED] can be.
<b>DR:</b>	You really want to explore this stuff don't you?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm online every frigging day trying to find a group of women that are going through codependency, I mean a group of people, it doesn't have to be women but there has got to be women in transition when you get a divorce and you go out there and you don't, and there's another—
<b>DR:</b>	You want support, you want support.
<b>PT:</b>	There's another problem, all our friends are the same friends, so we have, and there aren't a lot of them because we always did everything together, we traveled together, we did everything—
<b>DR:</b>	You haven't lost her.
<b>PT:</b>	No, logically, I haven't lost her, it's not logical.
<b>DR:</b>	If anything, well, well, in an emotional way you've lost something.
<b>PT:</b>	Definitely.  I get, I don't know, I don't feel depressed like I felt depressed before.
<b>DR:</b>	No, you don't seem depressed.  You know, I mean four to six weeks is what we give a loss, you know, you can be kind of a wreck for four to six weeks and then you have to start feeling better, so how long has it been?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, she met him about three weeks ago and it didn't start bothering me three weeks ago.
<b>DR:</b>	So you're in the throws of this loss.  Is today and yesterday worse than it was a week ago?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	You're getting better?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	It's the same?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I'm great after a therapy session.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you think about it all the time, you're utterly obsessed with this?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I'm more upset over the divorce than the, and the economy than I am over her, I really mean that, that's scaring the shit out of me.  I mean all of the sudden, all the sudden gas is going to be $4.00, a loaf of bread is $4.00 and then also, I went on, I told you I couldn't lose weight and you said it had nothing to do with the pills—
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And I knew I wasn't overeating, so I went on Nutri System.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know if that chemically does anything to you but I've lost almost, in twenty six days, I've lost almost half of what I gained because I had gone up to a size 12 and now I'm like an 8 1/2.
<b>DR:</b>	How many pounds have you lost?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know, I don't get on the scale.
<b>DR:</b>	How's your appetite?
<b>PT:</b>	I only eat the crap they give you, it doesn't make you hungry.
<b>DR:</b>	So your appetite is okay?
<b>PT:</b>	I would do better not eating that, the stuff is—
<b>DR:</b>	It's really tasteless?
<b>PT:</b>	It's this thick but you're not hungry, I don't know what they put in it.  You get some kind of crap for breakfast, it's not bad, you can have oatmeal, they had eggs, see the first time I went for the over 60 and didn't choose, today I chose but like you can have like a blueberry muffin, it's really not—
<b>DR:</b>	And it satisfies your need for food?
<b>PT:</b>	Totally.  You're supposed to have a morning snack, I'm not hungry.  You can have an afternoon snack, I'm not hungry.  You can have a salad, you can have a vegetable, I have a vegetable, I don't eat the salad.  At night I have a cookie or something, whatever is on there.  My nephew did the same thing, it's very easy to lose weight on there, you're not hungry.
<b>DR:</b>	Where do you get the food?  Where do you get it?
<b>PT:</b>	They send it in a box.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, a big box of food.
<b>PT:</b>	A big box of food.  It's lunch, it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack and dessert.
<b>DR:</b>	That's great and how many, like a weeks' worth of meals in one box?
<b>PT:</b>	That was twenty eight days, actually it's thirty five because they give you a week free the first and second month.
<b>DR:</b>	A whole month of all the food you're going to need to eat.
<b>PT:</b>	In a box this big.  Well the dinner box is this big.
<b>DR:</b>	And you heat it up?
<b>PT:</b>	You put it in the microwave.
<b>DR:</b>	Doesn't it have to be refrigerated?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Just like—
<b>PT:</b>	You keep it in a box, you don't even have to put it on the shelf.
<b>DR:</b>	It can't be good.  If you don't need to refrigerate it, it can't be good.
<b>PT:</b>	I think it's 1200 calories.
<b>DR:</b>	And you can't sneak anything.  How about drinking?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't have the desire.  I went out to dinner last night, what I did was, because I love ahi or yellow fin black and blue—
<b>DR:</b>	That's good for you.
<b>PT:</b>	So I cut it in half immediately, had the salad, had a portion—
<b>DR:</b>	You mean fish is not allowed?
<b>PT:</b>	You're allowed to go out and you have to, when you go out you have to behave.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay, no dessert?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I came home and had one of those board cookies.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow and you've lost a lot of weight?  How much did it cost for the month of food?
<b>PT:</b>	It's cheaper than food.  It's 200 and like, I think $272—
<b>DR:</b>	That's cheaper than food.
<b>PT:</b>	It's cheaper than food.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  A whole month of food.
<b>PT:</b>	Thirty five days, you get a month free for the first—
<b>DR:</b>	And you don't have to waste your time cooking either.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you throw it in the microwave, you only throw it in the microwave for 1 minute, if you put it in any longer, it's too hot to eat for like 7 hours.  It gets so hot, I can't even tell you.
<b>DR:</b>	Really.
<b>PT:</b>	I drink a lot of green tea, a lot of—
<b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b>	Probably but a lot of people lose weight on it and it's something with glucose level and—
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Something else.
<b>DR:</b>	Do they put a drug in it or it's just the glucose?  It's just the blood—
<b>PT:</b>	It's just the—
<b>DR:</b>	So keeping your blood sugar decent all the time reduces hunger?
<b>PT:</b>	Obviously.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	And as I said, I went on the over 60 which is supposed, you know, there's all different, there's men, there's, my granddaughter is on it, my daughter's best friend is a nutritionist and they're in business together and she, she changed it a little bit because she's only 9 and she's overweight and it was bothering her and she looks fabulous.
<b>DR:</b>	Wow.  So do you feel good about it?  Do you feel good about that?
<b>PT:</b>	Losing weight?
<b>DR:</b>	Losing weight.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just coming right off, I mean it's not—
<b>DR:</b>	You feel good.
<b>PT:</b>	I feel better about my body.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	My body definitely feels better.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have any suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I just want to get this—
<b>DR:</b>	Do you feel hopeless or helpless?
<b>PT:</b>	I feel helpless.  I don't feel hopeless because I know, I know, if I felt hopeless, I would stop the divorce papers.
<b>DR:</b>	Because he wants to stay, he wants—
<b>PT:</b>	Oh, he doesn't even, he has no clue, I given my lawyer his name, I told him to go, he's in love, he's in denial of the whole world, he is, it's a shame and he never changed.  It's not my fault, it really isn't, I stayed too long.  I filed in '86.  We lost a business, we couldn't afford to live apart.  We have not slept together since 1986 and he stays there.  He goes to work, he has dinner, watches TV, he's in bed by eight thirty, does nothing, he won't go to a movie, he won't travel, he's cheap as anything.  If we go to [DEIDENTIFIED] for a function, I have to pay for his airfare.  He bought me a Prada bag on purpose because I called him cheap and we had a big argument so he went and bought me a Prada bag and I didn't use it for about four months and my daughter said you better use that bag.  You know what it was, it didn't come from, it was to prove a point, it didn't come from a gift.
<b>DR:</b>	From the heart, right.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean it's—
<b>DR:</b>	But he's been in your life for a long time—
<b>PT:</b>	And he's—
<b>DR:</b>	At a time when you need some support.
<b>PT:</b>	And he takes, he would love just to take care of me, to do everything for me except that I'm making the same list of things that he has to get done that I made when I married him forty two years ago.
<b>DR:</b>	Like what, what's on the list?
<b>PT:</b>	He doesn't take care of things.  He doesn't take care of things around the house.  The garage, I finally made him, after four yeas, I brought somebody in to just take stuff out of the garage.  He's one of those ones that keeps everything and even with that—
<b>DR:</b>	He's a hoarder.
<b>PT:</b>	He's a hoarder, he never throws, he always needs something in the future, so I had somebody take four truckloads away and I still couldn't get my car in the garage.  I made him make room for my car, I couldn't take it anymore and that's what, he has not changed one iota in forty two years.  He won't go to therapy.  In fact, he went to therapy in 1986 when I was getting the divorce and they told me that he was too closed, that they can't get in.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah, the therapist said that.
<b>PT:</b>	The therapist says I can't do it.  I've never heard, did you ever hear of a therapist say that?
<b>DR:</b>	No.
<b>PT:</b>	They said that to me because I put, I put everybody in therapy, you know, we're all getting a divorce together.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	And the therapist said he's too closed, he will not open up, they tried for like two months.
<b>DR:</b>	Couldn't crack that nut.
<b>PT:</b>	No, his father and mother died and never cried.  We get this stupid dog that [NAME OTHER] said we needed and the dog swallowed my earring and he cried the whole time till the earring passed but never cried for his father or mother.
<b>DR:</b>	Sounds like an interesting—
<b>PT:</b>	Well, the stupid thing is I stayed for forty two years, that's what I'm kicking myself about.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, maybe you love him.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I don't even like him.  I really don't like him and I'm embarrassed by him but he's—
<b>DR:</b>	Is he odd?
<b>PT:</b>	He's a very good natured guy.  He is a good natured guy.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Is he odd?
<b>PT:</b>	Odd?  No.
<b>DR:</b>	So what are you embarrassed about?
<b>PT:</b>	Because he talks ridiculously when he's out in public, like he's more than he is, says things that are ridiculous.
<b>DR:</b>	Like grandiose?
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	Does he lie?
<b>PT:</b>	He used to lie all the time, now I just say you're lying, he goes I know.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Are you forward looking?
<b>PT:</b>	I'm a looking to the future?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I'm looking for a, the future of freedom is exciting.  Not to have to be with him anymore is, it's just, I can't even get over it, it's so [INAUDIBLE].  The fear of getting to that point, that's why I never left before, because I was always afraid.  I never knew why I was afraid.
<b>DR:</b>	What—
<b>PT:</b>	I've been in therapy all my life because I've been trying to get out the door.
<b>DR:</b>	And you think your friend is AWOL now and cannot help you at all?
<b>PT:</b>	She's, we had it out, she's going to be my friend, not in the same capacity but again, it's another change.
<b>DR:</b>	You know, you're very needy though.
<b>PT:</b>	Very needy right now.
<b>DR:</b>	To what extent can she help you?  I mean what can she give you?
<b>PT:</b>	I don't know what I even need.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let me tell you what you need.
<b>PT:</b>	All right, tell me what I need.
<b>DR:</b>	Nothing, you're fine.
<b>PT:</b>	I know, well that's what my therapist said.
<b>DR:</b>	You're extraordinarily resourceful, you will manage and the good news here is that you're not even close to the kind of depression that you've experienced in your life, this is mostly, 90% normal reaction to a very tough moment in your life, this is a very very tough moment—
<b>PT:</b>	Very tough.
<b>DR:</b>	For you especially.
<b>PT:</b>	Everything is changing at once to a person who hates change.
<b>DR:</b>	Right, right, the world is—
<b>PT:</b>	I like everything to be the same; you get up in the morning and you do exciting things—
<b>DR:</b>	You can do—
<b>PT:</b>	And you get to—
<b>DR:</b>	Listen, I know the house is worth crap now and the portfolio is worth crap and you're leaving your husband and—
<b>PT:</b>	But I don't mind if I live in a room in somebody's house.
<b>DR:</b>	And you're not needing to sell everything right away, you can do things slowly, especially because you don't like the change aspect so much.
<b>PT:</b>	No, I can't do anything fast with that.  I mean—
<b>DR:</b>	I mean, do you have the house up for sale?
<b>PT:</b>	No, we took it off and now unless he's let things go again, unless he brings it up to par, I told him that the other day.  [NAME OTHER] built a pond in the back, it went to shit because he didn't take care of it.  I said you've got to get rid of it, either fix it or get rid of it, so he, the gardener is taking it out but he just, he just neglects everything, everything gets neglected.
<b>DR:</b>	Well listen, the baggage will be gone soon.  You'll soon be without him.
<b>PT:</b>	And that makes me sick inside and makes me, it makes everything stiff.  It's not because, without him is a good word, soon is the bad word.  It may sound crazy but it's just, every part of me is stiff as a board and sometimes I can't breathe and if you talk to me I'll start crying for no reason but I'm not upset.
<b>DR:</b>	You're fragile.
<b>PT:</b>	Fragile, that's what I am, I am very, that's the perfect word, I'm very fragile and I take like two or three extra Klonopin a day.
<b>DR:</b>	Does it help?
<b>PT:</b>	No, it doesn't do a damn thing.
<b>DR:</b>	Does anything help?  Do you do yoga, breathing exercises?
<b>PT:</b>	I do breathing exercises, I tried yoga and my lower back started hurting, the doctor says I can't do yoga because I can't do the stretching but I do exercise.  I do a lot of breathing, a lot of breathing.  Now [NAME OTHER] has anxiety and he won't come in because he can't afford it.  He has morning anxiety.  He has no money.  He won't let me give him money and now he has morning anxiety, what do I do about that?  He won't come in because he can't spend the morning.  He started that business and it's just paying the expenses.  He just has a little anxiety in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	Well, let him take an antianxiety medicine to start but if it's the beginning of depression.
<b>PT:</b>	It isn't, it isn't because he's going to the same therapist.  What I've been doing is putting it on my, because he has a $2500 deductible so I put like an extra day on my insurance.
<b>DR:</b>	Right.
<b>PT:</b>	So he's been going, so he's not in a depressive state at all.
<b>DR:</b>	So why don't he just use Ativan or Klonopin or anything?
<b>PT:</b>	The Klonopin made him too sleepy.
<b>DR:</b>	So Ativan or Xanax, anything for anxiety.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, could you give him it, would you give him a—
<b>DR:</b>	Let an internist give him.
<b>PT:</b>	An internist?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I don't want, especially in [DEIDENTIFIED], they can just call it in.  They're very tough on [DEIDENTIFIED] docs with those—
<b>PT:</b>	All right, so I need to just call them and ask for Ativan?
<b>DR:</b>	Or Xanax, or Xanax.
<b>PT:</b>	He tried Xanax, it didn't do anything.
<b>DR:</b>	Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Do you think the Ativan, you know him, you know his makeup.
<b>DR:</b>	I can't treat, I haven't seen him for years though, I can't treat him without, I mean let him call me—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Let him call me and we'll talk on the phone and see what's going on.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, because if you insist on seeing him, I have no problem paying for it.
<b>DR:</b>	Just let him—
<b>PT:</b>	He just won't it.
<b>DR:</b>	Let him call me.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I'll figure it out in a few minutes—
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	What's going on with him?
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	More important is you though.  We've got to wrap you a little tighter.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I'm not excited to give you an antidepressant again so quickly.
<b>PT:</b>	And then, the doctor for my mouth gave me the Cymbalta.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	I slept for 12 hours on that one dose.
<b>DR:</b>	I told him you had been on it before.
<b>PT:</b>	And I told you I couldn't keep my eyes open and I told—
<b>DR:</b>	Are you still taking Cymbalta?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I took it one day.  I slept from six o'clock at night till six o'clock in the morning and was still tired.  I cannot take Cymbalta.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I remember that.  I gave it to you two years ago.
<b>PT:</b>	And I walked around like, everybody thought I was a drug addict, I slurred and couldn't even, I couldn't stay up and he gave me a very minor dose.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, what I'm going to do for you is try to stabilize the system, so you're taking 30 mg of BuSpar twice a day?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's three pills, right?
<b>DR:</b>	No, each pill, they come in 30's.
<b>PT:</b>	They didn't have, they didn't have 30.
<b>DR:</b>	So you have 15's?
<b>PT:</b>	It was the same ones you had and I take, they didn't come in the dose that you had prescribed.
<b>DR:</b>	So what'd they give you, 15's?
<b>PT:</b>	The same thing I had before.
<b>DR:</b>	Fifteens?  Take two in the morning, two at night?
<b>PT:</b>	No, I take three in the morning and two at, three at night and two in the morning.  Two and a half, we had two and a half at night and two in the morning, that's what we had agreed on and then you gave me—
<b>DR:</b>	Two and a half at night, so that's 30 plus another half, so 37.5 at night and what do you take in the morning?
<b>PT:</b>	Two.
<b>DR:</b>	Thirty in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	Because it didn't come in the 30, they said it didn't come in that.
<b>DR:</b>	Go to three at night, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	You'll be on 45 mg at night.  BuSpar is a stabilizer.  The Lamictal, I'd like to push the dose also.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, what do you want me to take?
<b>DR:</b>	All right, let's go up to 200.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So do 150 for a week, one and a half for a week and then 200.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	The Klonopin, you take one in the morning and one at night or do you take it through the day?
<b>PT:</b>	Two in the morning—
<b>DR:</b>	Of the 0.5's?
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, two at night and probably two or three during the day.
<b>DR:</b>	So you take—
<b>PT:</b>	Because you told me to take as much as I want.
<b>DR:</b>	Take as much as you need, but as much as you need that doesn't make you tired, doesn't make you tired at all.
<b>PT:</b>	Not during the day, I'm so wound up.
<b>DR:</b>	Then take more, take whatever dose doesn't make you tired.
<b>PT:</b>	I mean as soon as I take it at night, I'm sleeping in 5 seconds.  In the morning when I take it—
<b>DR:</b>	It sounds like your nighttime dose, you could use a smaller dose.  Why don't we use anywhere from 1 to 2 mg in the morning.  I don't want to chase your anxiety.  I don't want you to need to take it during the day.  I want to knock it out in the morning dose, so take a higher morning dose, like 2 mg in the morning.
<b>PT:</b>	So that's four pills?
<b>DR:</b>	Well, I'll give you the 1 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	In fact, let me give you the 2 mg tablets so you'll take a half or one tablet in the morning, okay.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay, because then I—
<b>DR:</b>	Please be careful, knowing that this is 2 mg.
<b>PT:</b>	I know but what I do is I go back to sleep for an hour and a half and then I'm not tired anymore.  These are 2 mg which would be equal to four?
<b>DR:</b>	Right and I'm writing that you take four a day but that's just so you get a lot of them.
<b>PT:</b>	Right, so you want me to take, you want me to take one pill in the morning and one pill at night?
<b>DR:</b>	Or half a pill at night.  I want to take, I want you to take enough so you don't have to chase it during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	So you don't, I don't want you to need any during the day.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	If you need it, it means your anxiety broke through whatever your morning dose was.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I don't want anxiety breaking through.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	I want to cover your anxiety.
<b>PT:</b>	Okay.
<b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Does that make sense to you?
<b>PT:</b>	It sounds beautiful.
<b>DR:</b>	But you can't be tired, you can't be slurring, you can't be staggering, you can't—
<b>PT:</b>	I don't do any—
<b>DR:</b>	Be sluggish.
<b>PT:</b>	I can even drive.
<b>DR:</b>	You're not supposed to drive unless you're able to.
<b>PT:</b>	I have a woman in the morning.
<b>DR:</b>	But if you have enough anxiety, you don't get tired from this medicine.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, I have enough anxiety.
<b>DR:</b>	If you have enough then, then just use it to the dose you need to.
<b>PT:</b>	The only time I get tired is in the morning and, as I said, I go back to sleep for an hour and a half.
<b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah.
<b>DR:</b>	Your age again?
<b>PT:</b>	[AGE] which I lied on, I put [AGE].
<b>DR:</b>	Everyone lies and about weight too.
<b>PT:</b>	Well, you don't have to put your weight.
<b>DR:</b>	All right, so that's the Klonopin.  Do you have enough Lamictal?
<b>PT:</b>	No.
<b>DR:</b>	Do you have a bunch of the 100's at least?
<b>PT:</b>	Actually, I think I just renewed the 100's.
<b>DR:</b>	Because I'll write you a prescription for the 200's.
<b>PT:</b>	I have enough for like, I just—
<b>DR:</b>	Do one and a half on the 100's.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.
<b>DR:</b>	For a week.
<b>PT:</b>	For a week and then go—
<b>DR:</b>	And then 200.
<b>PT:</b>	To the 200.
<b>DR:</b>	And then this new prescription, so either take two of those or one of the new ones, okay?
<b>PT:</b>	I think I just renewed the Lamictal, so I have it.  BuSpar I have to renew.  I have one renewal on the BuSpar but do you want to see me next month?
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Then I don't need a prescription for the BuSpar.
<b>DR:</b>	You may run out of Lamictal at the 100, so I'm writing the 200's.
<b>PT:</b>	Right.  No, I really don't feel depressed, I mean I know what depressed is.
<b>DR:</b>	Isn't it funny how you seem so depressed but you're really not because we know you're depressive illness, this is normal, this is normal.
<b>PT:</b>	But I never felt, it's crazy to feel good and bad at the same time, I mean it's not the same as depressed.
<b>DR:</b>	That's right.
<b>PT:</b>	I don't want to walk in front of a car, that's for sure.
<b>DR:</b>	No and you are very resourceful, you will manage this.
<b>PT:</b>	It's just getting over the hump.
<b>DR:</b>	Right and the future looks great for you, right, you'll be without the baggage of your husband, free.
<b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's one anxiety that I'm really going to get rid of.
<b>DR:</b>	Yeah.
<b>PT:</b>	Because he like guilts me into everything.
<b>DR:</b>	What do you mean he guilts you?
<b>PT:</b>	Well, he wants to do everything for me and I don't want him to do anything for me because I can do it myself and then he puts on this almost crying face and this is what I deal with.  I mean I'm sure we could be good friends if he doesn't go ape shit over the divorce because he's basically a nice guy, just not to my kids and—
<b>DR:</b>	I need you to sign at the X.
<b>PT:</b>	Actually, since [NAME OTHER] got sick, he likes [NAME OTHER].  He can't stand my daughter.
