"Any dreams?" the wise doctor inquired in his usual inimitable
fashion the minute I awoke earlier today and before I had
gone down to the streets for my breakfast.


Yes. They were there all right. A whole flood of them. They
streamed through my memory and up to my conscious mind
and I remembered them all. I had never had such an extensive
series of dreams in my life, that I can recall. That is what good
analysis is supposed to do. It brings the dreams closer to the
surface so we can remember them when we wake up. Because,
in all likelihood, we are always dreaming, even when we are
awake, but the dreams are so deep down we cannot recognize
them. But a good analyst can always bring the dreams up, closer
to conscious recognition. And Freud is such an analyst.


"Yes," I reply. "I had a whole slew of dreams. I've never had
so many different dream images in my life, to my knowledge."


Freud laughed. "That's probably not true, but it's a good
sign. When the patient is able to dream freely, without his
conscious mind pushing all the thoughts of our sleep back into
our unconscious forgetfulness after waking, then that is a very
good sign. It shows the analysis is starting to take hold. Starting
to free some of the repressed material. Starting to incorporate
some of that repressed id material within the boundaries and
regions of the ego. A very good sign."


"Well, I remember," I begin, "that it started when I went
downstairs to look in my mailbox and see if I had any letters.
Actually, I haven't had a letter in weeks and hardly anyone
writes to me any more. But when I went down to the hotel

[p. <i>136</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was about to go on and into the hundred-and-one episodes
that followed the opening scene in the dream, but the wise
doctor interrupted.


"Hold on, hold on, we cannot have too much at once," and
I saw his little black ballpoint pen was racing across the small
white pad, taking down my dream. He finally speared the pad
with one last period which he drove into the paper with a deft
and sure stroke of the pen, and then he looked up at me from
his seated position on the edge of my bedspread. "All right,
young man, now we will go over what we have before we
continue," he said.


"Fine," I replied, this time deciding to do a little analyzing
myself. "It seems to me that this dream is like my other dreams,"
I offer; "in that it is essentially the fulfillment of a wish."


"How many letters have you received in the last month?"
the wise doctor asked.


"Two or three at the most."


"Then you are perfectly correct in labeling your dream as
the fulfillment of a wish, young man. Do you have any other
observations concerning the beginning of your dream?"


"Well," I reply, "I remember that the girl behind the desk
was rather friendly. Everytime I go down and look in that
empty box, in my waking life that is, I seem to feel she disapproves
of my box always being empty and regards me in
rather a hostile light as one of the less popular members of her
hotel clientele."


"Very good," Freud replied. "Very good. Now we see why
you are leading an isolated social existence at the moment. Not
only does your paranoia prevent you from making friends, but
your mother does too. (Not actually, of course, young man;

[p. <i>137</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00135&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"All this throws more light on the problem of your present
attitude of social withdrawal. You refuse to socialize because
you feel in your mind that your mother wants you to socialize.
And you maintain your isolated existence as a means of maintaining
your independence. As a means of remaining free from
your mother and refusing to obey her wishes if you feel
inwardly that her wishes will take away your freedom if they
are obeyed. Do you see?"


"Yes," I reply. I see. "It is very logical. I had never thought
of it that way before. Although I feel consciously disappointed
every day when I stare in an empty mailbox, actually I am
satisfied with the absence of letters. Actually I want to cut
myself off from society. To maintain my independence from
those who wish me to be social."


"Yes, yes, very good," the wise doctor replies, commending

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The big bunny is just waking up. He takes a hop over to
us from the far side of the room, where he does his sleeping, and
looks at the wise doctor a few seconds and then tilts his big
head over to one side, inquiring with those soft eyes of his,
which can become alert and inquisitive when psychoanalysis is
being discussed; inquiring with his eyes and his slightly tilted
head what the wise doctor was talking about while he was
asleep. He wants to be filled in on all the details.


So the wise doctor strokes the big head and fills in all the
missing details with a few deft movements of his big friendly
physician's hand.


"Now you can tell me some more of the dream if you wish,"
the wise doctor said.


"When I started to sort out my mail I found that most of
it was a Christmas present, or rather Christmas presents, from
two beautiful girl friends, who had sent me a lot of artistic
pictures representing landscape scenes ..."


"Yes, yes," the wise doctor replied, ignoring the superficial
peculiarity that it is actually a long time from Christmas, realizing
that this is all part of the dream work and the dream
story is always filled with incongruities of one kind or another.


"And when I looked at one of the pictures I saw it was not
a picture of a landscape scene at all on closer examination, but
the setting of a hospital. And hospital beds with lots of patients.
And some attractive. English nurses. And when I looked even
closer I merged right into the picture and became part of it
and I wasn't standing in the hotel lobby any longer but lying
in a hospital bed being waited on by two attractive nurses."


"Yes, yes," the wise doctor answers. "It is all wish fulfillment.
All an attempt you make in your imaginary dreams to
replace your present state of social withdrawal with something
better. You have already told me that you had a better social
orientation at the Eastern hospital than you have now, so you

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It is all so simple, I think to myself. Once the wise doctor
explains it to me. I had never realized that the explanations
could be so easy to understand. Truth is not a complex problem
at all, I think to myself. It is always the simplest of the explanations
that are the most valid. All my notes 'way back there in
the early part of this manuscript about reducing the problems
to mathematical formulas aren't necessary. The final explanations,
in the clarifying discourse of the eminent Viennese physician,
prove to be even simpler than the smallest of mathematical
reductions. I am amazed.


The wise doctor laughs, reading my thoughts again. "Yes,"
he answers, "the simple explanations are usually the most valid.
The old proverb still holds true that the truth is usually right
there, staring us in the face, but we cannot see it for its very
closeness. We prefer to search the distant unattainable horizons,
when the explanations are usually standing right beside us, if we
could only see them."


The big bunny knows at this point that the eminent physician
must be talking about him, for he is standing right beside

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I think I will continue reciting my dream, which still has a
long way to go before I will have recited even part of it. But
the wise doctor reads my thought again and says, "No. I don't
think we will go into the rest of your dream. You understand
the way to interpret your unconscious wish fulfillments yourself
now. You were doing very well on your own awhile back.
So I will let you handle the rest of the dream yourself. I do
not need it for my notes."


I am flattered by the praise but I know that there would
really be no necessity to recite it, even if I did not have the
ability to interpret it myself. I know the wise doctor only
needs a clue here and there and he could probably tell a person
every night's dream he has experienced since his early childhood,
from start to finish. This is the way these wise doctors
are. They have abilities that would put all the I.B.M. computers
in the world to shame; if the I.B.M.'s united into one
big effort to come up with a prediction of one man's dream
life, they would not come anywhere close to the accuracy that
lies in the rapid-fire calculations and pen jottings of the wise
doctor Freud.


So I keep the rest of it to myself. The strange hallway
where I am given a Van Gogh masterpiece and put it against
the wall and when I come back later to pick up the same picture,
same frame and all, it has suddenly switched into a Degas by
some miraculous process. And the man in the hospital coming
along and telling me I had a contagious disease and I must stop
associating with the nurses and I told him he could go to hell.
And the strange walk in the country with the two girls who
had given me my pictures of the landscapes as Christmas
presents, leading me to some mysterious place I had never seen
before but which the two girls were intent on leading me to,
with a funny smile in their eyes as they directed me to my new
destination. And all the rest of it. I will keep it all to myself

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Now while you were sleeping," the wise doctor continues,
on a new track, "I was rereading some of your manuscript, and
many of the things you say are true. I do not want to discourage
you and say you must change your entire attitude, for
some of it is very true, very good."


"Oh?" I ask, a little pleased with the compliment.


"Yes, for example these remarks you make," he says, picking
out one of my early pages and holding it over to the window
for better light. "These remarks you make about our unconscious
masochism being a dangerous force and the necessity for
establishing some kind of solid control over its power; and perhaps
converting the destructive powers of our subconscious into
constructive powers with the help of our conscious ego. That
is all really very good."


"Oh?" is all I reply, though my mind is devouring the praise
as if it were gold.


"And that is what I will talk about today," the wise doctor
continues. "That is what I want to talk about. The controls and
the extent to which we can establish them. It is very important
if your cure is to be successful."


"Oh?" again.


"Yes. Very important. You see our control can never be
perfect. We must always leave a little territory left over for
our unconscious to cope with. We cannot absorb all the power
or energy into the domain of our ego. That is a very important
thing to realize. Very important. For if we go too far, we are
lost. Just as a nation who tries to conquer too many other
nations is always lost. Disintegration results. In the case of the
psyche, ego disintegration. If you remember, this is what finished
off the Roman Empire. They made many conquests and
extended the boundaries of their nationality far and wide. But
they bit off more than they could chew. Disintegration from
within resulted. And that was the end. The same with the
British Empire, or any empire or nation who tries to extend

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

How the wise doctor knows all this recent information about
South Africa is beyond me, but he must have his sources.


"It is the same with the ego," the wise doctor continues.
"The ego must never try to incorporate too much of the territory
of the id, nor try to establish too rigid a governmental
control over the id, or else the same thing will happen as happens
in history. Rebellion will take place. And disintegration. The id
will rebel and the ego will disintegrate. And then we are back
where we started. After the warfare and the settling of the dust,
we once again have a small weak ego with poor defenses. To
incorporate certain portions of the id territory into the domain
of the ego is very important, and very necessary for a cure.
But we must never bite off more than we can handle, to repeat
myself. We must never think that we can establish perfect ego
control over the destructive forces in our unconscious. We must
never think we can eliminate all the masochism and the paranoia.
So I must tell you these things so that your hopes will not soar
too high. I wish to warn you right now that I cannot and will
not promise you a perfect cure; because there is no such thing.
Even as there is no person living and never will be for that
matter, who is in perfect mental health. Do you understand?"


"Yes," I replied, realizing by the tone of his voice that he
was in a serious mood and wished particularly to stress this
point.


"We'll go on with the analogy then," the wise doctor continues.
"Which is actually a very accurate one. You see, when
we are first born, our egos are boundless. They know no limits.
You have written of this fact yourself in this manuscript. It is
called in psychology the stage of infantile omnipotence. The
infant does not identify his ego with his small helpless body.
Rather he identifies his ego with the whole of creation, by

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"This is like a vast empire. A nation which controls the
world, you might say; as the Romans once thought their
boundaries reached to the edges of the earth. But then a strange
thing begins to happen. We grow up. And as we grow up, our
poor omnipotent egos begin to lose a little of their omnipotence.
In short, our ego shrinks. Smaller and smaller as we grow. We
recognize that our little bodies are not Limitless. For the first
time we become aware of an environment. We realize there are
things around us which are not us, by means of our sense organs,
especially our sense of sight, which crystallize as we grow, and
begin to play their part in our lives. This is at first a very
frightening process to the growing child. The realization of an
environment. He does not mind so much that he has friendly
mothers and fathers around to help with any difficulties. Though
even these can be frightening on first recognition. But when he
sees there are not only fathers and mothers in his environment,
but literally hundreds and hundreds of people, not all of whom
feel as kindly about him as his own parents, then he is afraid.
Then his ego attains its limitations. Then his identity is no
longer so safe and secure. This second stage we call the stage
of infantile helplessness, when the ego shrinks in size and the
child must make friends with his father, mother, and brethren,
to help him fight off the even larger environment which extends
beyond his immediate family. Then the dependency needs take
root. It is like a large country gradually losing some of her
power. Her boundaries shrinking in size and her once vast
domains growing smaller. This country becomes in need of

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But the process continues and fears come in. The country
which was once so large, loses more and more of her territory
and her powers dwindle in size. It is very frightening to the
child when his ego does not stop at a certain point but continues
to shrink and to shrink, while the environment becomes
larger and more powerful every day. The child represses a lot
of this anxiety and fear. But if he cannot keep the anxiety
repressed, then a neurosis or a case of paranoia ensues. All the
while the id or the unconscious is also becoming more powerful.
The boundaries between the ego and the id are beginning to be
drawn up. No longer are the two merged in one. The desires of
the ego are no longer synonymous with the wishes of the
unconscious id. So the growing child is like a small nation,
trapped in between two large aggressive nations. The id and
the environment. The poor ego is afraid that one day his id will
join forces with his environment and cause his destruction. He
is terrified. Of course this is exactly what always happens in the
end by the process of death. But this is neither here nor there
for our purposes. You are still a young man and there is no
reason for you to fear the power of death at your age.


"Now when the ego grows too small, something must be
done. If something is not done, the ego is in serious trouble. It
will, in fact, be partially destroyed. This is all mental illness
amounts to. An ego which is no longer able to cope with the
powerful nations that have begun to take away all its former
strength—namely, the superego, the id, and the environment.


"So something must be done if the ego, or the individual
human being, is to be saved from annihilation. Namely, the ego
must begin to fight. It must begin to fight as it has never fought
in its life. And not only must it fight, it must come to peace
one way or another with some of its enemies. It must go around
looking for a few allies, a few friends. This it does in many
ways. For example, the normal growing child makes friends with
his parents. He stops hating his father and wanting to usurp his

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"After the child has made peace with his father and decided
that his mother is, to a certain extent privileged property
(though this is putting it a little crudely), and deciding to seek
his most intimate female companionships outside of the precincts
of his own home, then the child already feels he has won his
first victory. And he has. And he has drawn up a couple of
peace treaties and the enemies are not so numerous. But the
fight must continue and some people never even draw up this
first peace treaty in the proper manner, and consequently never
attain the satisfactory security that it brings. And some people
make too many concessions in this original treaty and give over
too many rights to the father and mother, leaving the ego still in
a weakened state. So you see, young man, how important it is
that we go over our peace treaties very carefully, reading all the
fine print if need be, and coming to the proper understandings.


"But the fight goes on. The father and mother are merely
two people and there are millions of people in the world for the
poor maturing youth to come to terms with; and none of them
exactly like the father and mother; so the first treaty cannot
appease all the foreign countries.


"So we go on, making our treaties, losing territory but
sometimes winning some of it back. By drawing up these peace
agreements. And also by doing a little hard trench fighting of
our own. Sometimes it is necessary to forget all our allies and
really dig in with only ourselves for friends and company. And
that is when the real courage is called for, and the real efforts.
Then we must really fight. And if we lose we lose. But if we
win, we win a great victory, and our egos, which have been
shrinking in size for so many years, suddenly expand their

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But here is where the trouble comes in, young man. We
should not be too ambitious in our struggles to regain our
former territories. We should not think we can have it all back.
For the truth is we cannot. We can never be as omnipotent or
secure as we were in the days of our infancy. The days of our
infancy when everybody smiled down at the helpless little child
with his playthings. The helpless little child which was, in
reality, a world in himself with an ego as large as the universe;
though only we knew this; our tall friends looking down at us
did not know this fact.


"The man who is too ambitious and wishes to have it all
back. Wishes again for a boundless ego with no limitations.
With either perfect control of the unconscious instincts or a
perfect union with these instincts. Such a man is bound to
failure in his struggle to regain his health. And that is why I
wish to calm down a little of your megalomania. A little of the
impossible, but praiseworthy, hopes you talk of in your first
pages. Control is the answer, as you state. But not perfect control,
for this is impossible and undesirable. The id will rebel and
you will have another breakdown. And any of your friends
who wish to establish this perfect control of the id and the
perfect conversion of unconscious destructiveness into conscious
constructiveness, will suffer a similar breakdown if they try the
experiment. This is very important. And I wish you to understand

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00145&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But we <i>can</i> hope to reconquer much of what was lost. That
is all a good psychiatrist tries to do. He explains to the patient
that all mental illness is actually a little lost territory. A little
weakening of the ego defenses. A little withdrawal and shrinkage
in the boundary lines which represent our relation with our
environment, with the world, with reality. So the good psychiatrists
try to get the patient on his feet again by coming in
with something new, namely, a new ally the poor patient or the
nervously distraught person hadn't even counted on—namely, the
psychiatrist himself. Now our egos have an ally. If we cannot
see this, then we have an unseen ally. But we still have an ally.
Let us all be grateful then for this unexpected help we had not
counted on and not begrudge psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis
their rightful status in our lives. For I am grateful
myself for the things I have learned in their service.


"Your feeling of <i>déjà vu</i> which you often mention, is, I
think, a very healthy sign. It represents more than the repetition
of a wish. It represents the repetition of reality. You are beginning
to recover now some of the territory which you lost. You
are gaining back some of the lands that once belonged to your
ego. And as you survey your recovered property you rejoice.
You feel that it is all familiar, that you have seen it all before,
you experience <i>déjà vu</i>, because it <i>is</i> familiar, it <i>is</i> already seen;
it is no more than the property which once rightfully belonged
to you and to your identity and which has now been reclaimed;
through a little hard sweat and the help of an understanding
doctor, if you do not mind me indulging in a little self-praise,
a fault we must all engage in now and then, especially when we

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00146&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The wise doctor is silent a few minutes after his long exposition.
finally he says, "Come on out for a walk with me, young
man; our success calls for a little celebration. I'll show you the
tavern where I bought the delicious beer I shared with you the
other night."

<b>March 13, 6:30 P.M.</b>

"Now we'll get right down to business and talk about your
sex life," the wise doctor surprises me with, in his own inimitable
fashion, after we have gotten back from our walk and for once
I was able to look into a couple of faces and read the marks of
honesty where before I had only seen the perverse thoughts and
the deceitful lip smiles.


The delicious beer is still working on my insides. I can't
remember where the tavern was. I was too intoxicated to take
down the address and it was a place I was surprised to find,
for I had never come across the place in my own daily walks.


The wise physician has his techniques though, I must grant
him as much. He waits until I am a little drunk before he pulls
out his trump card—what about your sex life. Just like that.
Out of the blue. Before I have even caught my breath from my
accompaniment of the wise doctor up the seven flights of stairs,
instead of taking the elevator as I usually do.


The big bunny is glad to see us back. His big head had
been resting on my bed, but when the door opened it immediately
came to attention and those two ears stood straight up.
He came over in a single hop and nearly knocked the two of
us to the floor he was so glad to see us. I guess he doesn't care
much for staying in hotel rooms by himself. When he's alone
he'd rather be out in the mountains somewhere, plowing that
big nose through the underbrush and looking for the hidden
honeys and the sweet roots that have all played their part in
making him the big bunny he is.

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00147&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But everything gets organized in a few minutes. Me sitting
in my desk chair and the wise doctor on the edge of my bed,
where he has a large expanse of bedspread to sort out my
associations on. And the big bunny sitting on the floor beside
him with his large nose under the wise physician's free arm and
his tail of fluff taking up the space on the bed not occupied by
my associations and the doctor's notes.


So we can get back to work.


"I notice in your associations and these pages you have written
that you don't talk much about sex except once or twice,"
the wise doctor says, leafing through the typewritten pages.
"You talk about me," the wise physician observes. "From the
beginning you have my name on enough of your pages; but you
don't say much about sex." At this point the doctor laughs a
little, chuckles a little, softly, so that most of the humor is
repressed and only the light frothy surface of the joke comes
to the surface and escapes his lips. "I must admit it's a bit of a
relief to read your pages," he says. "My poor name has been
so closely linked with the subject of sex that to find a piece of
writing with plenty of references to myself and my books, but
only a couple of sparks of the sexual theme, is very relaxing. A
pleasant change from the norm."


He continues chuckling a little. And then he snaps out of
his humor and says, "But after all, my young man, you did not
expect to be talking with the eminent Dr. Freud and escape the
subject forever, did you? No, young man, that is hardly possible,
or hardly desirable."


"I don't think I have any sex life at the moment. Not for
the last couple of years since I was in Chicago," I reply, calming
down a little from the initial shock of the question.


The wise doctor starts to laugh. His laughter is reflected in
the big bunny's eyes, which shine with the light of reflected
humor. Even big bunnies know you can't get away from a sex
life, not even if you're a human being with some kind of superiority
complex about the whole thing, trying to palm the erotic
instinct off on the large and small rabbits. It can't be done.
Humans are just as susceptible to the instinct as the bunnies.

"No, no, you can't make a statement like that and get away
with it," the wise doctor assures me, after the humor has subsided.
"No, no, young man, you simply can't. We all have a sex
life twenty-four hours around the clock and there's no escaping
it. You must know this if you have read my books. All those
cigarettes you're smoking all the time. That's a very strong sex
life right there, though you might be unaware of it."


"Oh," I reply, "you mean since the cigarettes are a satisfaction
of my oral needs and therefore take on sexual significance
by your theory that the mouth is as much a sexual zone as the
genitalia."


"Yes, yes, exactly; that is what I mean," the wise doctor
replies. "But don't think I'm making any inferences of a degrading
nature as they do in so many psychology books today. No.
That is all nonsense. All those perversions and aberrations and
big Latin words they make up to describe them. That is all so
much nonsense, young man. Please do not think I am making
any inferences of that nature. That is for the specialists to talk
about, not us, and it is unimportant in our therapy."


"Then how can smoking represent a sexual activity if it does
not represent a perverse unconscious need on the part of the
cigarette smoker?" I inquire.


"It's very simple, young man," the wise doctor replies. "I
do not think you have much perversion in you. That is not
your problem. We have already pointed out that your problem
is of a regressive nature. You wish in some of your dreams to
regress to the need for hospitalization because it offers you the
security you received from your mother as a child. We pointed
all that out already. You identify with persons who suffered,
such as the religious prophet you mentioned so often in your
early notes, by implication if not directly, since you speak often
of religious personages connected with him by common bonds
(such as the Virgin Mary, the saints and angels, etc.); you
identify with this Galilean prophet and his sufferings because
they represent to you the early security of your home, when
you might have had a few whacks on the behind, but were fed

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00149&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So now we see what the cigarettes are. They are nothing
more than your mother's breast. In the unconscious that is.
Nothing more. Nothing perverse or evil. Just a desire to escape
your sufferings and bewilderment by a warm loving breast. And
since our mother is the first object for our sexual love (as I
hope you realize by this time, and any readers you may one
day get for your associations, even if they are the nonsensical
invisible readers you speak of; I have tried to bring this point
home so many times I am running out of energy and if people
have not realized it yet, I will soon have to realize I am speaking
to a brick wall); since, then, to bring it home even once more,
our mother is our first erotic love object, we are ever afterwards
trying to get back in one way or another to our infantile sexual
relationship with her, even if it is only by smoking a few cigarettes.
And since these cigarettes symbolize, then, a sexual need
as well as a sexual memory, or else we wouldn't smoke them;
since this is true, the most ardent believer in the virtuous life
of sexual chastity, is actually engaging in a sex life of a rather
important nature, every time he innocently lights up one of
those little white sticks of tobacco and paper."


At this point the wise doctor probably decides he doesn't
want to be left out of any passionate sexual indulgence that
might be taking place in my humble abode and he walks over
to my desk where he removes one of my cigarettes from the
package on the glass top, knowing I do not mind, and lighting
it from the end of my cigarette which I extend for him.


The big bunny is glad to see this. Not only because he wants

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00150&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Now we know how ridiculous it is for you to say you
have no sexual life here in this city. Everytime you smoke a
cigarette, every time you go out to drink a cup of coffee or
eat a meal, every time you lie back on your bed and catch a
few hours' sleep, you are engaging in activity with strong sexual
overtones and undertones, though you may not realize it,
though none of us realizes it until we give the motivations for
our actions a thorough examination and a thorough analysis.
The simple phenomena of dreams are themselves loaded down
with erotic needs and erotic wish fulfillments, though we paint
over the real meanings of our dreams with a paintbrush, and
change all the deeper meanings into pretty little pictures, picturesque
water colors and pleasant oil paintings, with our preconscious
mind, so that our conscious mind will not be disturbed
when we wake up, by what the dream has been trying to tell
us during our sleep. If the explanation were given us right there
in our sleep, without any camouflaging taking place and requiring
us to make the discoveries ourselves at a later time by
analysis; if we understood the erotic symbols while we were
dreaming, we wouldn't be able to assimilate the knowledge. We
would probably never wake up. The shock would be too great.
But we do camouflage our dreams, for our own safety, by
painting all sorts of pretty pictures over the deep erotic core
that is at the source of everything we feel, hear, and see in the
dream.


"And also in real life. We do the same thing in our waking
existence. We camouflage all our activities. We pretend we are
doing them for one reason when we are really doing them for
another. We smoke a cigarette and tell ourselves we like the
nicotine and the soft smoke circling through our lungs. But this
is a deception which we have to tell ourselves. If we admitted
that we never actually got beyond the first months of our
infancy safely, and that we want to suckle again on a woman's

[p. <i>153</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00151&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So do not give me any more nonsense, young man, about
your celibate existence. But I would be glad to hear of the
experiences you had in Chicago; that you hinted at a little while
ago."


"They were not very satisfactory, I assure you," I replied,
a little unhappily as I remembered the experiences he was referring
to. Remembered the cheap hotel rooms and knocking at
the door and being pulled inside by a hand reaching through
the opening crack so fast I didn't know what was happening.
And fleeced of all my money in two seconds flat. For an hour
of love making on a bed which squeaked until I could hardly
hear myself think. And trying to keep back the masochism. The
unconscious masochism that flooded my conscious mind and
demanded the libidinal release. Fighting it and fighting it until
I couldn't hold it any longer and I was lying exhausted on the
broken-down bed watching the prostitute dress herself in two
seconds flat, combing her hair in the reflection of a cracked
stained mirror. Folding up all the dollar bills I had dropped on
the dresser and putting them in her large purse. And whispering
to me as she left, "Close the door when you leave and hurry up
and get off that bed; you've got to be out of here in five minutes
so I can bring in my next date." Dressing myself and combing
my hair in the light of the same cracked mirror and leaving.
And out into the dismal Chicago streets, where the rain fell in
soft sheets of grey death, blurring my vision, so that all the
neon lights and street lamps looked like a yellow haze.


"It was mostly with prostitutes," I confess.


The wise doctor's eyes gleam a little with the inner joy and
humor as I tell him this. "You don't call that satisfactory?" he
asks with a glint in those dark eyes. "Young man, anything is
better than nothing; and any satisfaction of our eros is better
than complete repression. And as for your choice of a love
object, I see nothing to be so disappointed about. To a certain
extent I envy you, young man. I never had the courage to try
that method myself. I must admit I was tempted. On my first

[p. <i>154</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00152&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The wise doctor's eyes are getting a little misty again as he
remembers the past. The long-ago past when he was just getting
started and the new ideas were burning in his heart like fire, and
he knew he must let them out to somebody. But who? There
was only Jung and Bleuler around to converse with. The University
of Vienna would not consider his theories. Then came
the invitation from America. G. Stanley Hall wrote him the
letter he had been waiting for. He and Jung were invited to
Clark University to lecture to the students on the subject of
psychoanalysis. Back there to the dim regions of memory and
the upturned faces taking in his revolutionary new ideas with
an expression of solemnity and earnest concentration that he
hadn't found in Vienna. And letting it all out to them—the
Oedipal situation and the unconscious instincts, the energy of
the libido and the necessity for finding the proper object relationship
if schizophrenia is to be avoided. The connection
between paranoia and megalomania. The deep-seated influence
of the sexual urge, from infancy to maturity. The castration
anxiety and the formation of a superego. The latency period
and the mobilization of the ego instincts to work out a sexual
relationship that would not entail anxiety. Anxiety and hysteria;
the anxiety neurosis and the other neuroses. The role of sexuality
in the etiology of these neuroses. The need to understand this if
we are to get anywhere. Drilling it into those innocent upturned
faces of young students—the need to understand the sexual basis
in the formation of all the neuroses. In a normal sexual life there
can be no neurosis. Drilling this point home. Because he had to.
Because he was correct, despite the ridicule in Vienna.


And the dreams. Dreaming of prostitutes and experiencing
the unexpected temptations. But keeping his marriage vow and
repressing the unconscious urges.

[p. <i>155</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00153&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

His conviction that America was a sexually repressed nation,
despite their superficial indulgences. His conviction that it was
a matriarchy and that Americans shouldn't marry as young as
they do, because this gives the man a disadvantage. Women are
more mature at a young age and young marriages will always
bring about a matriarchy, if there are enough of them.


Then back to Germany and the sweat, the toil; organizing
the many journals to give the theories of psychoanalysis a
medium of expression. His friend A. A. Brill who translated his
work into English to increase its audience. The bitter fights for
leadership. Jung as the first president of the International Psychoanalytical
Association. And then shirking his responsibilities
in this post and dropping away from the whole movement.
Adler always fighting for the top post, but trying to introduce
his own theories into the movement with the help of the
authority Freud granted him. The bitter hard fight; the struggle;
and the final victory.


"No, but I am regressing again from the subject at hand,"
the wise doctor apologizes, snapping out of the reveries. "I am
afraid even men of my age are apt to do that now and then,
my good man. It is even harder sometimes, as we grow older, to
keep ourselves awake and in the present. We drop off, we
elderly ones, into the past sometimes without being able to stop
ourselves. You will have to forgive me."


But he is forgiven without the words. I see it all too. Like
a motion picture playing itself against the screen of those dark
eyes. I see it all there and enjoy the digressions as much as the
wise physician.


"So we are back in the present again," the wise doctor says,
shaking his head a little to clear out any remnants of the gentle
melancholia that leads him so often into the realm of his
memories.


"Back in the present," he says, "with you, my good man, and
your paranoia and the sexual needs which underly your whole
problem."


"The sexual needs?" I inquire, still not quite seeing how my
sexual needs tie in with my paranoia and half afraid he is going

[p. <i>156</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00154&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"No, no, no," the wise doctor reassures me, reading my
thoughts again and seeing the slight apprehension of fear which
is probably present in my eyes as I look in his direction, waiting
for the answer to my inquiry.


"No, my good man," he continues, "there is no need to make
the homosexual connection. There is homosexuality in all of us,
due to the male and female genes in our make-up. There is no
one with a complete percentage of either male or female hormones.
So we are all homosexuals, if you do not mind another
of my sweeping statements. But this is not the basic connection
I am trying to make in your case. Each case must be treated
differently and analyzed differently and I do not see any signs
of overt homosexuality in your case, certainly the contrary, if
anything, so that I am compelled to find another causal relationship
between your sexuality and your paranoia. Which actually
I have already done, if you will think back."


This is orthodox Freudian procedure, I think to myself,
amazed at the consistency between Freud's actual therapy and
the methods he outlined in his writings. If the patient can make
the connections, let him make them. He will have more faith
in them. Lead the patient to the point where it all becomes clear
to him and then let him make the analysis himself. Even if the
therapist sees all the connections a long time before the patient
sees them. If there is any intellectual coercion, the results will
not be as permanent.


So I think back over the ground we have covered. The
identification problem and the hospital dreams and the maturation
process and my habit of making too many accusations. My
cigarette smoking and its explanation as an oral-dependency
trait. And all the rest. And the big bunny is going over it all
too. He is sitting there with his beautiful head soaking up the
wise doctor's caresses and his eyes looking straight into mine.
He is going back over all the analysis too, in his own way,
inside those big computers and starlit skies that fill his mind, he

[p. <i>157</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00155&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"It seems to me, from all we've said, that I haven't yet
successfully resolved my Oedipus complex," I suggest. This seems
to tie everything together, from my desire to return to a secure
hospital setting, to my guilt over seeing my brother punished
and the identification I make between my brother and my fellow
sufferers in mental hospitals, and my accusations which always
wind up making my mother the chief culprit, and the infantile
erotic needs that still play their part in my subconscious when I
smoke a cigarette, and all the rest of it; this explanation ties it
all up in a neat package.


The wise doctor's tense features relax and suffuse into an
expression of satisfaction. "Ahhhh ... there you have it." I
realize I have come to the right conclusion and know that Freud
is correct. If some doctor had told me what my problem was
in the same words, I wouldn't have accepted it. I would have
been reluctant to agree. I would not have understood the basis
for his statement. But when I can reach the conclusion myself,
based on my own line of reasoning, the conclusion is meaningful
to me and I accept it. Even if my own line of reasoning is not
really mine but the wise doctor's. Somehow there is a difference.
If I can make the final statement I am satisfied. I have passed
my examinations. The examination dream will no longer haunt
me. The wise doctor has given me a passing mark, couldn't
help but give me a passing mark after all the tutoring he has
been supplying me with.


The big bunny is satisfied too. I might have taken longer
than he to figure out the answer that flashed through those
inner computers of his the minute his tall ears took in the sound
waves caused by Dr. Freud's question; but the snowy rabbit
seems contented that I came up with the right conclusion. Very
contented in fact. So contented that he can now leave the comforting
arm of the wise physician and hop over to the other

[p. <i>158</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00156&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes, yes," the wise doctor says. "You have hit the nail on
the head. That is not your own prerogative, that particular
problem. It belongs to all of us. It is only a little more marked
in your case, and that was why I wanted to stress its importance
during the analysis.


"You write many scathing things about your mother in the
beginning of your script because of the Oedipal problem. You
want to possess her again as you did when you were a child.
You want her complete and undivided love again as you once
had it when you were an infant at her breast. This she cannot
give you. So you are bitter. You identify society with your
mother and think that society is as cruel to you as you imagine
your mother to be. You even accuse society of manufacturing
spiders and invisible guns to frighten you with. And of standing
around street corners with perverse intents, waiting to seduce
you into some alley and finish you off. That is your paranoia.
Your resentment that you are no longer young enough to
receive your mother's undivided attention; no longer young
enough for society's undivided attention and love, since you
replace your mother with society as a whole in your fantasies.
The hospital is merely a mother substitute. In the hospital you
<i>were</i> young again in a sense. You were sick and needed help.
So you got a little of that undivided attention you yearned for.
When you fantasize of the hospital you are really thinking of
the happy days of your infancy.


"By the way, I ought to ask you this. What is your relation
with your mother?"


"Oh," I reply, "My mother is paying my way at the moment.
I live on an allowance from her. And she was very helpful in
obtaining a discharge for me from the hospital, by providing
me with a home to visit, when I made my first excursions out
of the hospital setting."


"Ahhhh ..." the wise doctor says. "And you resent her for
all this, don't you?"


It is amazing. Consciously I do not resent the help at all.

[p. <i>159</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00157&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes, I guess I do, if I am to speak of my innermost
thoughts," I said.


"Good," the wise doctor answers. "Those are the only
thoughts we're really interested in in psychoanalysis—the innermost
ones.


"And now I will go a step further for you, young man. I
will tell you why you resent your mother's help. You feel that
your mother's purpose in freeing you from the hospital setting,
or helping to do so with the home she provided you with when
you were getting better—you feel that these purposes were not
maternal on her part, but rather motivated by her desire to
dominate your life and obtain control over you. You even feel
that the allowance she now provides you with is motivated by
the same hostile intentions."


The ideas are shocking and hard for me to absorb. I find it
hard to take them in. But it is true, all of it. Deep back in there,
in my innermost thoughts. I do not feel any of this consciously,
but the wise doctor's words ring a bell way back there in my
mind somewhere, ring it loud and clear, and I know he is telling
the truth.


"And now, young man, we will not rest from our labors
until we have probed even a little deeper. If you do not mind?"


"No, I don't mind. I realize it's important," I reply, my
mind still unrecovered from the wise doctor's first discoveries
when he started that probing that cuts away into the innermost
layers of consciousness more successfully than any surgeon's
knife could ever do. And more than a little anxious over what
he will discover if he continues the probe to a deeper level.


"So first we have the unconscious resentment over your
mother's help," the wise doctor tells me. "This is hard for you
to realize because of your dependency needs. So it is repressed
and it exists only on an unconscious level. Then we go a little
deeper and we find that we have far from struck bottom yet.
The resentment has reasons which support it. Primarily the

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00158&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes, yes, everything you say is true," I admit, reluctant to
admit it, but realizing it is better to bring truth up to the surface
than to repress it and let it fester in my unconscious.


"But now we will continue the exploration," the wise doctor
says, smiling a little and stroking the soft mass of fur beside
him, who has woken up again and come over to the wise doctor
for some more of those deft strokes with those weather-beaten
physician's hands. Maybe he had a bad dream or something and
is coming over for a little therapy from the man who is so
skilled at soothing the pains that come to us in our unpleasant
dreams, and taking all the fear away, either with that rapid-fire
tongue of his or, in the case of big bunnies, with a few skillful
strokes of his hand.


"Now we will continue ..." the wise doctor says again.
"You see the truth is not what you subconsciously think it is.
Your mother really is not the dominant, aggressive, and sadistic
person you think she is. I'm sure that her only real intention in
supplying you with a monthy allowance and a home to come
to when things get too tough or when you want to visit your
family—her only real reason in supplying you with these comforts
—is that she really loves you and doesn't want you to starve
to death in some forgotten city. You know this, on an even
deeper level than the level we have already explored. But you
want to put the blame on someone else. We all do. It is only
natural. The last person we ever want to blame is ourselves.
And if we have to construct a million and one rationalizations
and weave them into an intricate pattern of self-justification,
covering the whole framework of our ego and even reaching
deep into our unconscious regions. Even if we have to do this,
we prefer the deception to the truth. If we were not able, in our
own minds at least, to put the blame elsewhere, to palm it off

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00159&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I know it is the latter in the case of the wise doctor. For he
has a fine beard which he sometimes runs his fingers through,
when he's not running them through the white fuzz covering
the back of the big bunny. But he still has a little hair left that
I guess sometimes needs combing, despite his venerable age.


"So you see," he continues, "what we have on the deepest
level. Guilt. Nothing more nor less. Then we let the guilt
change into accusation as it works its way up to a higher level
of consciousness. Then the accusation converts into resentment,
which is the problem you have with your mother, still on an
unconscious stratum. Because the truth is, young man, that way
deep down there, inside that mind of yours that I don't wish
to cast any aspersions on because I like some of your manuscript
and wouldn't have paid you this visit if I hadn't had a certain
amount of respect for you. Way in there, though, you know
damn well (pardon an overused expression if you can) that all
your problems are of your own making. As all sensible people
realize the same thing, on the deepest levels of awareness. You
know that you are no longer a child and if you wish to establish
an independent life for yourself, it would be the easiest thing
in the world if you applied yourself to the problem. And if
you wish to remain dependent on your mother for occasional
financial help, then this is all right too, but the accusations are
not. The accusations and the resentment are basically unjustified.
But this is hard to realize. Hard for me or you or anyone to
realize. We would all like to put the blame elsewhere. And that
is part of the reason for the present trend in psychology, which,
I must admit, has its faults. We give the ego no credit at all
nowadays. Or at least our contemporary psychologists don't
with their little experimental laboratories and the poor animals
they subject to so much dissection and electric shock. They
put it all down to environment and heredity. There isn't anything
else, they say, so convinced. Why convinced? Because
then they are safe. Then the unconscious guilts are safely

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00160&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So you see, my good man, that you are not alone with your
problem of paranoia. Many people have it, even the most
respected scientists of our modern culture, to a certain extent.
The Oedipal situation is of more importance than any of my
contemporaries gave it credit for. We cannot go on all our lives
blaming our fathers and mothers, or blaming the society we
eventually put in their place. Perhaps we can do this when we
are children. But it is even dangerous in childhood to establish
too strong a dependency. You see the child depends for his
welfare on his parents. They feed and clothe him. But there is
a lot of frustration and unhappiness in the growing child, the
primary frustration of course being his jealousy of the marital
act which he is conscious that his parents perform. If he could
perform this marital act too, the child thinks, he would be
happy. But he does not realize that he is too young, only a
child. So he starts to blame his parents for all his troubles. They
deny him the marital act and therefore he suffers. As grownups
we do the same thing. Society won't give us everything we
want, so we blame society. We do not realize that we are still
children. We must grow up. The child eventually realizes this.
He knows he cannot do with his mother what his father does.
So he begins to work on his complex, and if he is successful he
comes to a satisfactory conclusion and when he is grown up
he has a wife of his own. All that's required is a little self-discipline
and a little less desire to blame his father and mother
for his sufferings and deprivations. So you see, young man,
how it all ties in with the Oedipal theme?"

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Yes," I admit. "I see."


"Good," the wise doctor answers. "Good. See that you continue
to realize the truth in what I have just told you, and I
think your cure is assured. It will take awhile to work out all
the snags and smaller knots, but these will all come loose in time.
You have taken the first and most important step, realized the
motivations in your problem, and I have confidence that your
cure is already well under way.


"As I said before, do not expect perfection. None of us work
out all the problems connected with our childhood experiences
with the Oedipus complex. If our life spans increased to a couple
of hundred years with the new discoveries of medicine, I still
do not think that in this long time any one individual would
ever resolve the problem completely.


"What is essential is that you realize no one is perfect.
Perhaps your mother is not perfect, but neither are you. You
cannot always shove the blame on another. Only a perfect
human being can do this and there is no such thing; unless of
course you are a Catholic and believe in the perfection of Christ.
But even then, you would only have one example from the
whole of human history, and by the same faith, you would not
be able to allow that either you or anyone beside that one person
was perfect.


"Anyone who does not realize these things is due for a slight
case of paranoia, young man. You are not alone. The Oedipal
triangle exists in the consciousness of us all, somewhere or other
in the psychic structure. No one among us, even the most
mature, can help but feel a trace of anxiety when he continually
places the blame outside of himself. It goes right back to the
primal scene when the child wished to blame the father for
hurting the mother and inwardly desired to take the father's
place with the mother. This twofold wish with its components
of eros and aggression, always brings with it the inevitable fear
of punishment at the hands of the father, and the castration
complex as it is called by those who wish to put it coarsely
and bluntly, but accurately, ensues. All our anxieties eventually
go back to our childhood fears of the father.

"So let us take heart. It is not so dreadful as we think. Our
fathers and mothers did not want to kill us when we were children.
And no one wants to kill us now. Our fathers and mothers
did not want to frighten us with giant spiders or hidden guns
or vicious lip smiles and perverted thoughts. This is all in our
imaginations. All in our subconscious desire to blame our failings
on someone else, and in the process, to accuse our friends of all
sorts of unreasonable crimes. Because, by so doing, we keep
ourselves in the clear and can continue to avoid our responsibilities.
Our primal responsibility always being ourself. For when
we are properly responsible to ourselves and our own mental
welfare, then our responsibilities to others fall naturally into
place. The old English poet was not far from the truth when
he said that our fault lies not in our stars but in ourselves. And
I think he also wrote that he who is true to his own self, cannot
then be false to any other man. Those old poets knew what
they were talking about, despite our new effort to reduce everything
to a carefully controlled scientific method and ignore the
writings of the poets as so much nonsense. We had some good
poets of our own, we Germans. Goethe was nobody's fool, nor
was Schiller. Science must one day make her peace with the
past, just as we poor humans must do with our childhood experiences.
No one can reject the past as completely profitless, not
even a well-organized scientific culture such as we have today.
You can't reject all the proverbs and the beautiful poetry and
the values of real down-to-earth personal experience. No matter
how much our new age tries to wipe out all the old methods of
looking for the truth, a compromise must come about sometime,
and some of those old well-tried methods will have to come
back, have to be assimilated again into our modern culture, just
as the individual human ego must one day come to terms with
the past and incorporate some of it into his being and eventually
regain some of the old lost provinces, that the ego lost during
the process of maturation, when physiological growth was so
rapid we hardly noticed that our mental ego was rapidly
dwindling down to naught."


It is peaceful. The fires in my mind have all died down to

The big bunny is fast asleep again. All those big problems I
was hoping he would figure out he has already passed on to the
wise doctor to solve. All the ones with a medical significance, at
any rate. As for all those distant stars and galaxies, he might still
be enjoying them for all I know, and calculating the orbits of
distant comets. Doing it in his sleep, his big head resting on the
knees of the wise doctor. The wise doctor whose dark eyes flash
with a million memories even as he talks, flash with a million
dreams, flash with a million thoughts and insights.

<b>March 13, 11 P.M.</b>

I know I will not sleep at all tonight. The analysis is in full
swing, and in a respect—it is almost over. I know the important
points have all been stressed. I know there is not much more for
the wise doctor to tell me.


The important thing—the relation between my paranoia and
my unresolved Oedipal conflict, has come like the culminating
climax to the train of thought the good physician has established
during our talks. He feels me out, reads through my long pages
of social commentary and my many accusations against the
hypocrisies of contemporary society, talks to me about the non-existent
spiders, the invisible guns, my nightmares and my more
pleasant dreams—and then he ties the whole thing in with my
Oedipal complex with a sure swift move in which he compares
the sufferings inflicted on us by our fellow men with our first
punishments at the hands of our parents.


He goes beyond the modern interpreters who tell us our
guilt causes us to seek punishment at the hands of society. He

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

With this interpretation of the dreaded illness of paranoia
still playing its soothing chords in my tired mind, I am calmer.
The fears are going away. There are no more guns pointing in
the windows.


And then when he finishes the interpretation off by connecting
the masochism with our earliest erotic and libidinal feelings,
the cure is complete. It is not the masochism which is primary,
but the libido and its erotic foundation. The masochism is
merely an adjustment mechanism we put into play when we
cannot satisfy our desires to the extents we would like to. The
masochism and the paranoia are still there, in my unconscious.
I know this. But they are not the foundation of my existence.
I also know this now. Now that I have talked for a few days
with the wise doctor from Vienna who brought so many suffering
patients out of their torments during his lifetime; and into
the light of reason, where the horrible fantasies, the nightmares,
and the devastating physical symptoms dissolved as the morning
fog does with the approach of sunlight.


They have told me this wise doctor from Vienna has no
sense of humor. In the past they have told me this—old friends
of mine. But I disagree. In my opinion his sense of the comic
couldn't be better. He sees through all the horrors we take
seriously and realizes how funny they are, if they are to be
looked at rationally.


Even now he is smiling, sitting on my bed and going through
some of his notes, wondering if there are any further points to
be covered in our talks before the analysis will be able to work
its way to a successful conclusion.


My guess is he's not smiling over his notes, though. He's
smiling about something else, and I wonder what it is.

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Finally he looks up from his note pad and speaks. "Would
you like to know what I think of some of our contemporary
workers in the field of modern psychology, young man? Just
so you won't think the old doctor can't help but see a couple
of faults here and there himself in this society of ours your
paranoia casts so much aspersion upon?"


"Sure."


"Very well, young man, I will tell you. Not that I wish to
cast any shadows over your progress or bring about a recurrence
of your paranoia and your many suspicions concerning the
progress of contemporary culture. But we all have our little
hostilities and a joke here and there is often a healthy outlet. If
we could limit our aggression to a few harmless jokes, we would
be doing well.


"Anyway, young man," the wise doctor continues, his eyes
dancing with the light of humor.


"Anyway ... supposing there was a hatchet man loose in
some city. I'm not naming any names, so don't assume the city
is the one you are living in, and it is only meant as a story, so
please do not allow your paranoia to feed on what I tell you ...


"But just supposing in some hypothetical city there was a
man loose, going around and scaring all the populace. Supposing
further, he finally came across a man he chose to be his victim
and performed his act of murder.


"Suppose further, that after this vicious crime had been
committed, and the poor victim had suffered a severance of his
spinal cord at the joint of the neck; suppose then, after it was
all over and the poor man was dead and the criminal had committed
his crime—suppose, young man, that at this point two of
our modern psychologists happened to be walking by ...


"So these two emissaries from the wonderful halls of modern
science came in their stroll upon the poor corpse. Meanwhile,
the criminal, seeing the two strangers approaching, grows a little
worried. But his worry does not last long, because he sees the
two psychologists have no interest in him, the murderer, whatsoever;
they are only interested in the dead victim."


It is a rather gruesome story for the wise doctor to be

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Even the big bunny is a little worried. His ears are standing
straight up wondering why the eminent physician is telling such
a story, and a little apprehensive about the whole thing.


But the wise doctor smiles. "No, young man," he says. "Hear
me out. I am only telling you a story ..." And he runs his
fingers over the big bunny's nose and I see the ears relax a little.


There is a sparkle in the doctor's eyes, too; so I know there
is something behind the story, which has incited him to tell it.


"Yes, young man. Supposing our two modern psychologists
came on our gruesome scene and paid no attention whatsoever
to the cause of what they saw. Forgot completely that for every
effect there is a cause; that for every crime there is a criminal.
So absorbed were they by the spectacle of the dead man, that
they did not think of anything else ...


"And while they looked at what they saw, supposing, young
man, they started to talk to each other, and diagnose the morbid
spectacle. It would go something like this I think—


"One man would say to the other, ‘My dear colleague. Look
what we have here. A definite case of schizophrenia, I would
say.’


"‘Yes,’ the other would say. ‘A definite split in the personality.
Why, my friend, the head is not even connected with the
body. Definitely a case of schizoid disorganization.’


"So they would diagnose the case, my young man, these two
emissaries from the school of modern academic psychology. And
you know what would happen while these two learned men
were thus diagnosing the case?"


"No," I reply. "What?"


"The criminal who had caused the whole thing would escape
without a hope of ever being found again. He would clear out,
while our two learned psychologists were examining the unpleasant
spectacle with such interest and fascination. That is what
would happen, young man, if you do not mind my throwing a
friendly barb in the direction of some of my contemporary
colleagues, for their own good."

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The wise doctor has a sense of humor all right. Never let it
be said otherwise. A little morbid perhaps, but that might just
be the late hour at which he tells me his little story. But his
sarcasm is as sharp as anyone else's. And his satire is as poignant.
The man who wrote <i>Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious</i>.
He knows what it's all about, and how we can release our
unconscious hostilities with a few well-placed words and a
midnight fable. While the big bunny's eyes light up with a big
smile as he realizes how accurately the wise doctor has uncovered
the foibles of some of our modern academicians.


"Yes, my young man, that is what they would do," the
doctor continues, a trace of sadness in his voice now, and the
humor apparently dissipated. "Yes. They would forget that
cause and effect go hand in hand, and we cannot solve the problem
by merely studying the effects. When a man is dead, he is
dead, and the spectacle might prove gruesome, but we do not
help it by staring at the spilt milk.


"Now, young man, I shall tell you what two good psychoanalysts
would have done in a similar situation, if you do not
mind."


"No, I would like to hear."


"Very well, I shall tell you. Supposing then two good psychoanalysts
from the old Viennese school where I trained so
many of them, supposing they had come across the same unfortunate
accident. What do you suppose they would have done,
young man?"


"What?" I inquire.


"They would have given the unfortunate victim no more
than a cursory glance, only enough of their attention to assure
themselves that he was beyond help. Then, young man, they
would have looked about for the cause of such a monstrous
sight.


"And they would have seen the criminal before he had gone
ten steps. Then, if a policeman were in sight, they would have
called him. If not, they would have caught the culprit themselves.
And they would not have rested from their labors until
the culprit was safely locked in the nearest jail. That, my good

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"So you see, young man, I have a few complaints of my own
to make. But I do not mean to frighten you. And please do not
take my story as any more than that—a story I have used to
express a particular point."


I see the point the wise doctor is making. We are so interested
nowadays in studying the morbid aspects of our paranoia
and our unconscious masochism and all the harm our inner
instincts can inflict on our conscious personalities if we do not
know how to deal properly with our instincts, if we do not
know the correct time for release and the correct time for
repression, if we do not know when to indulge and when to
control; that we lose sight of how all these insufficiencies and
ignorances came into existence. We forget the causes, or we
simply avoid the responsibility of looking for them. The morbid
spectacle of the unhappy results fascinates us too much. We
indulge in the horrors of paranoia and suspicion and fear,
because we have not the energy, or the integrity, to seek a

[p. <i>171</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"But of course," the wise doctor continues, his eyes sparkling
again with a touch of humor.


"Of course, if our big rabbit friend here were with us, no
one would ever dare approach us in the first place. I'm sure
he could deal the final blow to any criminal that came to do us
harm with one blow of that big powerful nose, before the
hatchet man knew what hit him, or before he could come within
ten yards of us. These bunnies are a new innovation. With
enough of them, we won't have anything to worry about, and
doctors of my standing will be liable to lose some of their high
reputation, I am afraid."


I know the wise doctor is joking a little as he says these
words. But the big rabbit referred to in the physician's speech
does not take the words as humorous. He is certain the good
Dr. Freud means every word he says. I can see it in those eyes
which go wide with wonder as his tall ears take in the words
of praise. Then he lifts up one of his huge white paws and puts
it in the eminent doctor's lap, deciding to shake hands on such
a sensible conclusion to the long anecdote which had even had
our bunny friend a little scared until Dr. Freud had assured us
that it was something the rabbits of the world could deal with
easily, with one deft blow of their sniffing apparatus.


Then he acknowledges his appreciation of such exalted praise
by resting his large head on the bed next to the wise doctor and
allowing the rough weather-beaten hands to work their way
through his tangle of white hair, cleaning out the rough spots,
and putting all the strands of soft fuzz in their proper place and
order.


And it is very peaceful. No sounds at all any more, even
from out in the streets. Occasionally I hear a woman's laughter
far in the distance, but it is sporadic and too distant to really

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048402-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But I am not sleepy. Freud's anecdote has woken me up,
refreshed me, set me thinking again. Freud himself is not tired
either. He has gone back to his notes and is glancing through
them swiftly, trying to find if there is anything else to bring
up before the night is over.


He looks up briefly from his notes and glances with a serious
expression into my eyes. Again I have the feeling he can see
right through. That I can hide nothing from him. That it is my
thoughts he is looking at, not the pupils of my eyes upon which
his gaze is apparently focused. Then he smiles.


"Yes, my good man," he says. "You are much better. You
look very different from the first night I saw you. Much
better ..."
