BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
CLIENT: So I have been doing better.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I woke up yesterday and just felt like shit. I had a lot of anxiety, just [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Because (ph)?
CLIENT: And I couldn't—I went to the football game on Sunday and when I came home from the game I fell right asleep and on the couch. And so it's I got a lot of sleep [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: . . . but just I couldn't get out of bed.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, I felt stressed out and I'm not really sure why. And, um, the whole day was pretty shitty. I saw my psychiatrist, she, um, took me off the Nortriptyline.
THERAPIST: Oh good. 
CLIENT: And, um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: And then you want [inaudible]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [inaudible] [0:01:00]
CLIENT: And it's funny because I woke up this morning at seven and couldn't fall back to sleep, which I have a feeling is the Nortriptyline had just been knocking me out you know.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And, um, (sighing) she upped the Lamictal to 75 mg and the Prozac. She also put me on Abilify.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And she gave me these 15 mg tablets that she wants me to cut into four, and they're like tiny.
THERAPIST: Huh.
CLIENT: So it's like I'm taking like [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . 3.75 mg or whatever, but I woke up today and I still feel like shit, [like rotten] (ph). I don't know if I'm under the weather or what, just, uh, you know. I pick Ian up from school today, which I'm actually kind of looking forward to a little bit you know. And I feel like [overlapping voices] [0:02:04]
THERAPIST: So, all right, in terms of feeling like shit today, both anxiety and like physically feeling like shit?
CLIENT: Yeah. It's like I was nauseous this morning and it was like and so I had a lot of postnasal drip over the night [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: . . . and so I was nauseous. And try [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:02:20] a lot [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: . . . [to eat anything] (ph)
THERAPIST: . . . in this school year [inaudible] kind of sucks really [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: . . . [inaudible]
CLIENT: I really don't get sick though you know.
THERAPIST: Oh okay.
CLIENT: So.
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: And I had a lot of postnasal drip, which, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . um, you know often makes me nauseous in the morning somehow, so. But it's not like it was bothering me all day, I just, so I felt rundown. I didn't go to Frisbee. Um, I eat crappy food for dinner. Just I don't know what was going on yesterday.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: But it seems to have carried through to today. And I was going to say that kind of looking forward to picking up Ian because then that is some excuse not to have to do work you know. [0:03:07]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: I've got some stuff to do today but I'm just kind of putting everything off. So I'm going to go in the office tomorrow and try and bang (ph) out of a long day in the office, but I have to pick up Lucille, so. But if I'm able to get up early and get out the door and I get in the office before 11 you know.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: That's been part of my problem, is I haven't been able to get out of bed till nine or ten o'clock.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: You know so if I get up, I mean [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: So you know if you're off your drugs, getting off the Nortriptyline helps you to get out of bed.
CLIENT: Yeah and you know I can get, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . if I can wake up at seven and be out the door [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . by eight you know that's a huge difference.
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [0:03:50]
CLIENT: And, um, got this hearing on Thursday for assessment of damages for my summary judgment motion. And at first the attorney was asking me for, you know to agree to a continuance, which I did not because I know my clients would not like that. And she's got a trial, um, today, and she hasn't filed a motion yet and she keeps asking me for the documents that I'm going to give the court. And it's kind of like "are you going to file a continuance or not" you know?
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: And, um, I think maybe she's waiting to see how today goes and see if she's going to be still on trial on Thursday, but my preference would be to put it off for [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: . . . another month or so.
THERAPIST: [Of course] (ph).
CLIENT: Uh, for it right now, um, not really sure what I do. I hand in the damages and I don't know, I've really, I've never been in one of these hearings before you know so. Um, the woman owes us like 20,000 dollars; you know who knows what we're going to see. You know and she wants to, she wants the court or order a meeting, though see her lawyer hasn't asked for one, to order a meeting of the trustees. And she wants to know why the repairs haven't been done, but she hasn't paid her 2,100 dollar special assessment. [0:05:13]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: Ghee, I don't know, why haven't the repairs been done you know? Um, so it's just kind of a pain in the ass, and having to deal with all that when I'm not feeling that well is not that (pause) helpful. I'm blowing off practice tonight for a finance committee meeting, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:05:39]
CLIENT: . . . so it's like I'm not getting my full [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . exercise, and it's going to be raining so I'm probably not going to ride my bike out to the farm, so I'm, I don't know, tempted just to do it but I don't know. You know I'd like to see Lucille and I don't know when she's going to come home.
THERAPIST: Yeah, m-hmm. [0:06:00]
CLIENT: Um, she seems a little more—you know she's still clingy to her mom, but I have video of her kicking the soccer ball and then picking it up and walking by me going "daddy, daddy, daddy", so you know.
THERAPIST: That's cool.
CLIENT: And she went outside with just me to kick the soccer ball around. She just kind of picked up a little basketball and threw it and then went back inside, but we're getting along better.
THERAPIST: Well that's great.
CLIENT: And, um, so I want to see her to keep the momentum [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . kind of going you know, but, um, and now I just feel like crap. [0:06:42] 
I got to go to the registry today. And, um, you know I just sent out my estimated tax payments yesterday and, um, I don't have any money in the [inaudible] bank accounts. You know I'm supposed to be getting the money from my parents and supposedly it's being mailed to me today. So I'm probably going to bounce, um, the checks to the IRS and the DOR, which I don't know, I don't know if they just automatically resubmit them, which would be fine [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: . . . [with me] (ph).
THERAPIST: If they waited [inaudible]
CLIENT: Yeah, but if that automatically happens or whether they come down hard on me. Because part of these, um, agreements is that you agree to, uh, you know stay up-to-date on your current taxes, so, which means not filing late. But, um, I got some registered letter from the IRS, I don't know what it's about, uh, who knows, who knows what that is. Maybe today I'll walk over there. I know it's going to be raining but you know I will just throw my raincoat on, pick it up and see what that is. I don't know if they're going to reject our offer and compromise, but [inaudible] [0:08:20]
Oh (sighing). It's like I've you know, I don't know, I don't know why. I mean I know I was—probably partly why I was rundown yesterday was being at the football game all day Sunday you know. But it's not like I drank too much or ate too much or really you know went overboard in any way. And, um, (pause) just unmotivated today. [Silence from [00:08:57] to [00:09:18]
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
CLIENT: I don't know at what level the Lamictal and the Prozac start kicking in. I'm up to like 20 mg on the Prozac, which doesn't seem [that long] so I don't know. And I'm on 75 mg of the Lamictal, which seems like that should work at that level.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Silence from [00:09:43] to [00:09:52]
CLIENT: But that's what she'll tell you] (ph), just wants me on the Lamictal and the Prozac and that's it, [overlapping voices] [0:09:57]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: . . . which is fine with me. I don't know what she wants to do about the Klonopin and the Wellbutrin. You know when we talked about that yesterday, which you know (pause) it's kind of overwhelming, all the medications I'm on right now.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It's like every psychiatrist just added a different medication without getting rid of something; you know they just kept piling it on and piling on.
THERAPIST: Yeah (ph).
CLIENT: I don't know. [Silence from [00:10:45] to [00:11:05] Did you have this type client before I came in?
THERAPIST: No. What like though?
CLIENT: Just sleeping late. This is [inaudible]
THERAPIST: I (chuckling) know.
CLIENT: It seems I woke up at seven and I'm sitting around with nothing to do, with no impetus e-mailing for work. I feel bogged down sometimes by e-mail, you know just this constant—you know I have all this film (ph), which I need. But the vast majority of e-mails are just waste, you know [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: . . . just crap. You know I want to make lists, whether it's fantasy football or my friends from college and you know 20 to 30 e-mails in a day of just—you know and I can't even keep track of the, [overlapping voices] [0:12:10]
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: . . . what everyone's talking about. It's just, it's overwhelming at times. There's got to be some better way to manage it.
THERAPIST: Right. [Silence from [00:12:24] to [00:12:31]
CLIENT: Do you preorder your iPhone 5?
THERAPIST: No.
CLIENT: Not yet?
THERAPIST: [Do you have to preorder] (ph)? [Silence from [00:12:37] to [00:12:45]
CLIENT: If I wasn't broke I'd get one.
THERAPIST: Yeah. Tell me do you know why you were feeling more anxious when you woke up on Monday morning?
CLIENT: Well I mean it, it could've (ph) been a constant thing for a long time that Mondays were just very anxiety driven days for me, you know just trying to figure out all that I needed to do.
THERAPIST: It just sounds like a bigger change than usual, from having a bit better to really feeling crummy in a way that you haven't [kind of come back from] (ph).
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean tell her the way you're feeling, particularly with the Klonopin, that she adjust (ph) the medication, but [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: She didn't seem—well she said that it seemed normal, didn't seem unusual that I would become depressed again after having felt better you know. [0:14:00]
THERAPIST: Yeah, but usually there'd be some kind of clear like precipitance you know.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: I mean often there is for you, like you know [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: From the past loss (ph).
THERAPIST: How would you [inaudible]
CLIENT: What's that?
THERAPIST: How was your meeting?
CLIENT: Uh, it was good. I did fine on Sat-, on Sunday. That's why I was, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . there was just such a marked difference between how I have been feeling and yesterday you know, and it's continuing through today and I just—I don't know. I don't know if I'm stressed out about not getting that money in. I really didn't feel stressed out about it and I don't. (Big sigh) I don't know, I'm just (sighing) (pause), just not sure. [Silence from [00:15:10] to [00:15:26]
I even took a nap yesterday you know. Like I was so exhausted and came home, took a nap for an hour or so (pause), still felt like crap. [Silence from [00:15:38] to [00:16:00] And it's not like I have any you know manifestations or any type of illness, other than you know dry heaving and then nauseous in the morning, which is something I've had for a long time.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: You know it comes and goes, but the windows have been open and then it's colder out and [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . I'm full of snot now, and so [I don't even know if] (ph) it's allergies or what.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: But the weird thing is I don't throw anything up, it's just dry heaves, you know which is somewhat painful. Usually at least there's like a bunch of snot coming up (ph) [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Coming up too.
CLIENT: . . . you know, but no such luck. And I get nervous and it's like I don't want to take more medication and then throw up and then [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: . . . let the medication come up [inaudible] again. [Silence from [00:17:02] to [00:17:18] (Sighing) Going to a bluegrass festival this weekend.
THERAPIST: Right (ph).
CLIENT: Doing some camping. [Silence from [00:17:26] to (yawning) [00:17:59]
THERAPIST: This is not the first football game, right? You had one the week before?
CLIENT: No, this is the first one of the season.
THERAPIST: So it's the first one?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: And I'm wondering if it had something to do with Monday morning coming, like what happened with you. I know you said you had a good time but what, like what happened?
CLIENT: Nothing really. I mean we lost but it's not like I was really upset about it or you know, I mean I just—you know I didn't overeat and I didn't over drink and I didn't you know do anything, or (ph) you know it was like I was really, felt like I was hung over yesterday you know and I wasn't.
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: And, uh, I got plenty of sleep because I feel asleep on the couch like 8:30, 9:00, you know what I mean.
THERAPIST: Do you know why you were so wiped out?
CLIENT: Um, I mean I'm usually wiped out. You know you're just standing around at the tailgate and then [overlapping voices] [0:19:01]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: . . . you know it is, it's a long day, so it's not [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh. When'd you get out of there?
CLIENT: Well we meet at like eight in the morning, get home at you know seven at night you know.
THERAPIST: Oh, wow! So you like leave here at eight?
CLIENT: Well meet at the [inaudible at 00:19:21] at eight.
THERAPIST: Okay, wow!
CLIENT: So it's a long day, so I'm not surprised I fell asleep when I got home.
THERAPIST: What are you doing all that—I mean I understand you're tailgating, but you must be parked and hanging out by 9:30 or ten, right?
CLIENT: Yeah. Playing poker, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: And then the game [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: . . . we get a little [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: . . . starts at like [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: One; goes till about 4:30. Then I wait for traffic to clear up a little bit and have some hotdogs.
THERAPIST: So you leave at like 5:30 or 6:00? [0:20:01]
CLIENT: Well depending on the traffic.
THERAPIST: That is a long day.
CLIENT: Yeah (yawning).
THERAPIST: And how many people?
CLIENT: Well, I don't know, seven or eight, nine, ten.
THERAPIST: [Kind of] (ph) [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: It varies with the week.
THERAPIST: But they were something you've really known for a while? [Silence from [00:20:26] to (client sighing) [00:20:56] Yeah and it sounded like it was a good day. You probably haven't seen some of those people since last season?
CLIENT: Yeah, for a while. [Silence from [00:21:04] to (yawning) [00:21:22]
THERAPIST: And then you woke up Monday morning, having slept plenty, when did you wake up?
CLIENT: Um, (pause) I don't know at like eight o'clock I moved to the couch where you know I just kind of kept sleeping. And then I know I decided I had to go to the office to do a couple of things.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: So I took a shower and went to the office for an hour. [Silence from [00:21:58] to [00:22:20]
THERAPIST: And you seem more sad now than [overlapping voices]
CLIENT: Well I definitely feel like shit you know, just [silence and/or inaudible from [00:22:28] to [00:22:48] and I feel more just lack of hope for most everything you know.
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: Which I don't know if that went away or not but (pause) I'm thinking about it more, definitely yesterday and last night. [0:23:10]
THERAPIST: Hope around work and money, hope around getting involved with somebody?
CLIENT: Yeah. [Silence from [00:23:22] to [00:23:38]
THERAPIST: Well tell me about it. What are you thinking?
CLIENT: I don't know, just that it sucks and it just (pause) doesn't seem to improve you know, doesn't [inaudible]
THERAPIST: Hope (ph)? [Silence and/or inaudible from [00:23:59] to [00:24:21]
CLIENT: Just not happy with work and all the little things I got to do that I'm just, it's not enough, not being very productive. You know I'll get done what absolutely has to be done and just (pause), like I'm just praying that tomorrow I have the energy to put in a full day and get some stuff done. [Silence from [00:24:48] to [00:25:02]
So I feel like I just, I just want some sort of break from everything, but (pause) when I'm not doing anything I'm stressed out about what I should be doing you know.
THERAPIST: M-hmm. [A break, sounds like you're ready] (ph).
CLIENT: I am so uptight (ph). [inaudible at 00:25:26]—not sure who is talking] I am kind of looking forward to picking up Ian because it will just give me something to do.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: I really don't want to go to this farmhouse (ph) committee meeting tonight. And it's not like I'm even bummed out that I'm not playing. I really don't feel that I got it in me to play right now you now. [0:26:03]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: I worked out yesterday, did my calisthenics.
THERAPIST: Squats and push-ups?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [inaudible at 00:26:12]
CLIENT: [inaudible] (slight chuckle by someone). I'm going to have Chinese food for dinner, which I don't know why I got Chinese food when I've got all this food in the fridge.
THERAPIST: Yeah (ph). [Silence and/or inaudible from [00:26:32] to [00:28:25] Kind of curious, I mean you know sometimes when you were depressed you'll feel better and then feel worse again. But, you know often there's a sense of like part of it might be revenge for having had a better time or having good things happen and feeling better. This doesn't quite have that feel, you know what I mean? Like people who look at, who really take it out on themselves for enjoying things a bit more or having a better time, but I don't—that that doesn't fit I don't think here.
And often, over a while, for even like a bunch of months, your mood and level of anxiety has you know correlated pretty well with things like how much money you have coming in, how sort of on top of things or not you are with work, or you know how much you're doing things that you enjoy, seeing people or getting some exercise, time for doing (ph) stuff like that. In other words, like often it seems somewhat, you know the ups and downs seem somewhat related to sort of financial things or circumstances (ph), and neither of those fit here. [0:30:02]
I mean the circumstances are not worse than last week. There are some things that are better, in fact, about feeling sorry [about your game and going out] (ph) with Lucille. And yet, you know you're feeling bad enough that you wouldn't even feel up to going and playing bridge the other night if you could. So this, yeah, I guess is a bit striking to me.
CLIENT: No, it's surprising to me, too.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Because I thought I was doing better and that the change in medications was having an effect then (ph). [0:31:04]
THERAPIST: Yeah. You know it's like there are things that could account for things yesterday. I mean you know sometimes other people sleep a lot and anxiety or depression can be worse [inaudible at 00:31:21] you know get a little less sleep one night and it can actually [inaudible] things or at least within a short-term way, and the opposite is true if you sleep a little longer. But it's lasting through till today, so it doesn't seem like it's just that. You know if it was just yesterday morning or something and it last through the day yesterday that would be one thing, but it last longer than that. [Silence from [00:31:50] to [00:32:05]
CLIENT: I don't know [inaudible] just negative feelings about everything you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Silence and/or inaudible from [00:32:13] to [00:34:14] And sleeping (ph) around, like you mentioned, and one of the kind of negative feeling was where it comes to mind?
CLIENT: I don't know, I just you know [silence from [00:34:37] to [00:34:52] it's hard to explain so many fears (ph), just feel that I'm you know just kind of running in place and not getting anywhere, not improving or just you know that I'm not even sliding backwards you know that just [silence from [00:35:16] to [00:35:25] so many things seem daunting [you know] (ph). [Silence from [00:35:26] to [00:35:40]
THERAPIST: Maybe you are a bit afraid of getting better. [Silence and/or inaudible from [00:35:45] to [00:36:12] Maybe you worry about how much more responsibly you'll feel for things, if you're feeling better. [Silence from [00:36:24] to [00:36:31]
CLIENT: I don't know. Yesterday was, you know it just felt like, you know so many times on Monday I wake up and I'm just anxious and stressed about work [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Hmm.
CLIENT: . . . and the things that I have to do, and that's what it seemed like it was you know. And I'm just [silence and/or inaudible from [00:36:53] to (sighing) [00:38:15]
THERAPIST: And so yesterday seemed like pretty usual, usual to like bad Monday morning stuff?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Just the panic that comes with getting back to a work week and all you have to do?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: Well I could feel that, which I guess amounts to both being aware of the things you need to get done, being worried about having the kind of energy to do those things, the focus to do those things, you know the things that like present financial worries, like bouncing checks to the IRS, stuff like that? [0:39:01]
CLIENT: [I guess, yeah] (ph). And the weird thing is, is that it really wasn't you know (pause), there was some difference to not having the money and writing and sending the checks off and I know I just felt indifferent about it.
THERAPIST: M-hmm.
CLIENT: It's not like [it could be done] (ph), it's not like that's what was upsetting me you know, it was almost a sort of a "oh shit, today's the 17th; I need to send these out".
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: You know so it's like I didn't even really have time to dwell on it. [Silence from [00:39:40] to [00:40:13] In some ways it's like I'm lost. It's like you know I just don't know what direction to turn you know. And, um, [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: . . . there just doesn't seem to be an end. You know I've always had this feeling that just all of the sudden things will start going right you know and just [adding up] (ph), just [silence and/or inaudible from [00:40:52] to [00:41:09]
THERAPIST: What was that comment?
CLIENT: Just things in my life you know, like there is just, like I reach some point of you know success or just (pause) [overlapping voices]
THERAPIST: [I see] (ph).
CLIENT: . . . you know a new relationship, things just going in the right direction you know.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: The car not working properly you know (slight chuckle).
THERAPIST: M-hmm, yeah.
CLIENT: It's that it's like sometimes I don't even know where to begin you know.
THERAPIST: Yeah (ph). [Silence from [00:41:53] to (client sighing a couple of times) [00:44:35] Yeah, you're going to help (ph) it happen concerning a new relationship [inaudible]
CLIENT: [inaudible at 00:44:49]
THERAPIST: We need to stop for now (client sighing).
CLIENT: Yeah. Eight-thirty on Friday (ph)?
THERAPIST: M-hmm (ph).
CLIENT: Okay (ph). [Silence from [00:45:10] to end—0:45:22]
