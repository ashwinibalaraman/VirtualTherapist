<font size="5"><b>First Person Account: The Quiet Discrimination</b></font>

Anonymous


<b>The article that begins below is
the sixth in a series of personal accounts
to be published in the
<i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>. We hope
that mental health professionals—the
<i>Bulletin's</i> primary audience—will
take this opportunity
to learn about the issues and difficulties
confronted by consumers
of mental health care. In addition,
we hope that these accounts will
give patients and families a better
sense of not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be
anticipated by persons with serious
emotional difficulties. Although
there are a number of
books and articles describing the
personal experiences of patients
and families with mental disorder,
we believe there is a
continuing need for experiences to
be shared among mental health
professionals, families, and current
and former patients.</b>


<b>We welcome other contributions
from patients, ex-patients, or family
members. Our major editorial
requirement is that such contributions
be clearly written and organized
and that a novel or unique
aspect of schizophrenia be described,
with special emphasis on
points that will be important for
professionals. Clinicians who see
articulate patients, with experiences
they believe should be
shared, might encourage these patients
to submit their articles to

Person Accounts</i>.—The Editors</b>


On November 28, 1976, an editorial
entitled "Miracles for What?"
appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>. It
discussed discrimination in employment
against the recovered
cancer patient as well as the person
who has undergone psychiatric
treatment.


The editorial gave a brief but accurate
picture of the discrimination
that is faced by people who
were once ill but are either in remission
or undergoing treatment.
The fact that the physical or emotional
problem has been stabilized
and that this person is now able
and eager to regain a former position
or is seeking a job is not taken
into consideration. The discrimination
is subtle and quiet.


I write from personal experience.
My emotional difficulties
continued from earlier years and
"blossomed" out in adulthood. Interestingly
enough, I somehow
was able to function relatively well
if only in regard to being employable.
Finally, the stress came to a
head and my outpatient counseling
was not enough. After a suicidal
action, I ended up hospitalized
on a psychiatric unit. I now
not only had to deal with this trauma
but upon release the distress of
losing my job. The stress I was under
led me—perhaps foolishly—to
"confide" in my employer. I was
at work only a few days when I
was politely fired but "assured"
that I would receive good references.
The fact that I had been
there for nearly 4 years and a good
worker did not matter. My lack of
self-esteem and self-confidence increased
along with my anxiety.
The days passed into weeks, the
weeks into months. I sat home depressed,
on medication, and collected
unemployment compensation.
In my few moments of
self-confidence, I would go out
looking for a job. This more often
than not added a great deal of
stress. I now found that I had to
contend with explaining an obvious
time lapse from my last job. I
also noticed that many job applications
would inquire about medical

[p. <i>737</i>]

I eventually did gain employment
but only through fixing up
my work history on the application.
I learned that honesty is not
always the best policy. Unfortunately
there were more hospitalizations,
but upon discharge my
self-confidence was greater and,
though I did not get a job quickly,
a job would develop—again, only
through doctoring my work history.
In the past several years I have
managed for the most part to be
gainfully employed, off medication,
and to earn a college degree
with the continuous help of outpatient
therapy.


There is much discrimination
against people who seek or have
obtained psychiatric treatment (inpatient
or outpatient). No matter
how productive and functioning
they are, the stigma is still there. It
not only exists in employment. I
am considering graduate school,
and there too, questions about
past and present psychiatric treatment
confront me. This is especially
true for professional schools
for mental health clinicians, a field
in which I am interested. The admission
forms often request a biographical
sketch describing how
the student became interested in
the field and any personal experiences
with psychiatry. This, too,
obviously is a Catch-22 position.
To admit my personal experiences
is to court possible and realistic rejection,
(I have spoken off the record
with an instructor in a well-known
school of social work about
my situation, and his advice was: I
do not think discussing your hospital
experiences would be a plus.
General outpatient therapy might
be a positive point, but hospitalization
would make the admissions
committee wary, no matter how
far in the past it was.) If I do not
discuss it, I would in a way be
compromising my principles.
These experiences have had a very
deep and intense effect on my life
and interest in the field. If anything,
I believe I am especially
sensitive and aware as no one
who has not gone through these
experiences could be.


How many thousands of people
who need help do not seek it out
of fear of what others will think,
the fear of loss of employment or
admission/readmission to a professional
school, as well as possibly
in the case of adoption?


We have made extensive gains
in efforts to rid ourselves of discrimination
based upon sex, age,
religion, and race. We have "affirmative
action" programs, yet
when will society at large rid itself
of its prejudices and fears regarding
the stabilized and functioning
person who has undergone or is
undergoing psychotherapy?


The media has not helped in this
matter. It has in fact often hindered
the cause. Hardly a month
goes by that we do not read a lurid
news story of "man goes berserk
and kills neighbor" or "former
mental patient kills wife." Those
headlines are remembered. We do
<i>not</i> remember or pay attention, because
it never is reported, to the
fact that thousands of individuals
who have undergone treatment,
are undergoing counseling, or are
stabilized on medication are able
to go about their daily lives without
harming or frightening others.


The evidence is overwhelming
that the majority of mental patients
and former mental patients
are, as a class, less dangerous than
the "average" citizen. Witness the
New York study showing that over
a 5-year period the arrest rate for
5,000 former patients, all adult
males, was less than 1/12th the
rate for the community at large;
the rate for serious crime was even
lower. Those former patients who
did brush against the law usually
were guilty of no more than loitering,
vagrancy, or public intoxication.
Other studies of patients
and prospective patients have
reached the same conclusions:
mental illness does not cause dangerous
behavior. Mental patients
may plot and scheme, they may
threaten injury to themselves or
others, but rarely do they follow
through. The most common characteristic
of mental patients is an
inability to organize their lives and
assert themselves. And that characteristic
makes them less dangerous
than people who are more aggressive,
hence, more "normal"
(Ennis 1972, p. 225).


Recovered cancer patients, recovered
alcoholics, the handicapped,
and those who have
undergone or are undergoing psychotherapy
(and/or hospitalization
as well) are eager to be productive
members of society. They want to
regain their place in the work
force. They want nothing more
and nothing less than to be given
that opportunity! I would hazard
to guess that they as a whole are

[p. <i>738</i>]

Chemotherapy has vastly improved,
lengthened, and saved the
lives of cancer patients. Psychotherapy
and psychotropic drugs
have helped thousands of people
to continue to go about their daily
lives, in the work force as well as
the home and community. Medical
and psychiatric treatment has been
a boon to many, but at times I am
sure they painfully wonder, for
what?
