Borderline personality disorder is a form of madness made of mood
disorders and neurological malfunctions. People with borderline personality
heat up fast and have trouble cooling back down. Emotions run
high. Impulse and inhibition run together like hot and cold water from
a tap. Once the borderline body reaches this place of hypervigilance and
despair, every day presents new evidence of apocalypse and new opportunities
for hysteria and resignation.


One of my students attempts suicide.


One of my students starts to flirt with me.

[p. <i>160</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00161&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In between this riptide of people I care about moving-away and
moving-towards, my mind slips and twists and goes haywire. Something
inside me crumples. I put my head down on the desk. Students
flow around my desk and out the door. I gather my books and notes
and go home, thinking about Neal in a coma a few blocks from campus.
Two weeks ago he stood in my office and cried without shame
over his broken heart.


FIRST GIRLFRIEND. FIRST BREAK UP.


Evan saw me crumple in class. He emails that night. He wants to
know if I'm okay. I never understood how professors could find common
ground with students, how desire and comfort might assemble in
the space between our cynicism and their uncertainty. After managing a
case of walking melancholia for more than a year, my balance and direction
falter and I find myself chasing the moon in a strange boy's eyes. I
stand naked in a public square and BARK AGAINST THE DOG STAR.


<i>We are in this together,</i> I think.


<i>The grown-ups don't understand</i>.

[p. <i>161</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00162&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He calls and I feel fourteen and giddy inside. We talk about Neal,
about regret, about what I could have said or done. He tells me not to
feel guilty. He tells me I am GOOD and REAL and ALIVE and VELVET.


I drift off to sleep already high. I flirted back and it should scare me
but it doesn't. I don't know who I am, doing this thing I purse my lips
at other people for doing.


We go to the Black Box on campus and see a play called <i>Crave</i> by
Sarah Kane. She was a British playwright who battled bipolar disorder
for years before killing herself at twenty-eight. I hear a young actor's
voice fill the space with words that will echo in my mind for months:


The only thing I want to say I've said already, and it's<br />
a bit fucking tedious to say it again, no matter how<br />
true it is, no matter that it's the one unifying thought<br />
humanity has. <b>HOW CAN YOU LEAVE<br />
ME LIKE THIS?</b>


I will step to their cadence across campus and around the block
each evening as I walk my dogs in the sandy margins of the roads in my
neighborhood.


Evan and I go to a bar and start out on opposite sides of the table
but our conversation grows so intense it pulls me from one side of the
table to the other. We talk fiercely with each other, heads together and
hands animated. We drink whiskey in plastic cups. I tell him he is a
flower that BLOSSOMED IN A MUD PUDDLE. It's a line about a girl from
a novella I'm teaching. He says that's the coolest thing anyone ever said
about him. We talk and talk and talk. Evan tells me he was recently

[p. <i>162</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00163&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He hints at problems in his relationship.


<i>Yes! He has a girlfriend too</i>.


He talks about sometimes becoming so frustrated he punches the
wall in the bathroom where he works, about his therapist and his new
meds, about the ways Neal's suicide attempt keeps hitting him in random
spurts and waves, and finally about the way we can maybe LAME,
POETIC, ROMANTIC, HE ADMITS IT heal each other. About how maybe the
wounds of two people can somehow mend together.


We grin. OUR BROKEN PARTS MATCH.


I say <i>I hope it doesn't look weird that we're talking<br />
to each other so much</i>.


He says <i>Fuck you we're saving each other's lives</i> to<br />
our imagined critics.


Yes. That is what we are doing. I feel dazed by his intensity. We hug
twice in the parking lot. Rush home to email each other. We email each
other twenty times a day. I don't feel so alone anymore.


He tells me he needs this.


He tells me he hopes I need it too.


And I do.

[p. <i>163</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00164&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

AFTER SITTING IN the hospital parking lot crying myself hoarse, I
need him to make me feel better. I need him like a new addict needs a
twenty bag of heroin.


For pleasure, partly, but mostly to stop the pain.


After fifteen months of wearing down my sanity locked in a love
triangle with Emily and her partner, I have given up all semblance of
doing the right thing. I start signing my emails <i>Love, Lisa</i> and he starts
signing his messages <i>love evan. Not trying to be a copycat</i>, he explains,
<i>just trying to say yes i get it too</i>.


This is when things start to heat up.


We stand with our thumbs in our back pockets, the sound of tennis
shoes shifting on asphalt filling the silences in our conversation. I
ask if he wants to get a drink or sit in the car and talk. He chooses SIT
IN THE CAR AND TALK, and I find a remote parking lot on campus, turn
the music up, lean across the front seat and put my mouth on his.


The disk plays and plays.


The final track starts, a cover of "Against All Odds" by The Postal
Service. I have been raised on the sadness of this song. My mother listened
to the original Phil Collins version when my father left her. I sat
in the backseat of the car memorizing the words "You're the only one

[p. <i>164</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00165&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I laugh and tell Evan I already feel sad when I hear this song, like
I'm walking around with a prepackaged kit of emotions ready to unwrap
when the end comes.


"I have fast-forwarded to the end of our relationship," I tell him,
"already pictured the moment when I will want to say to you, 'How can
I just let you walk away?' When I will want to say, 'Turn around and
see me cry.'"


I think he will find this as amusing as I do. <i>I am an empty space</i>,
har har.


Instead he winces, cuts his eyes sideways. "Why would you do that?"


If you look up the phrase INAPPROPRIATE LOVE OBJECT in the dictionary,
you will see Evan's picture there.


The details float in my mind like buoys warning swimmers not to
go farther out.


Evan is my student.


Evan is twenty-one.


Evan has a live-in girlfriend.


Evan is in treatment for bipolar disorder.


Evan is moving to Michigan.



[p. <i>165</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00166&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The absurdity of my fixation on Evan is what finally helps me—
several months after the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder—
recognize my obsessions as a pattern, as something that goes on inside
me. It is also the moment when the people around me recognize I have
a disorder, where before they just thought I was getting a raw deal from
Emily. They watch in horror as I transfer the balance of my emotional
account from one attachment fetish person to another.


The crush on Evan would most likely have stayed on the level of
compulsive email and the occasional stolen kiss except for what happens
next, which takes me by surprise and changes the infatuation into
something more real and less comfortable, something more physical and
less fun. Kat invites Evan and Nicholas to join us for an academic conference
on popular culture in Atlanta, and I know instantly that this is
not a good idea but when Evan calls to ask if I want to cancel my plane
reservation, ride to Atlanta with him, I say yes.


<b>THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. I SAY YES</b>.

[p. <i>166</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00167&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This contradiction encapsulates everything I know about my relationship
history.


We moon and argue and drink too much and nurse hangovers
together while we're in Atlanta. He gives me a toe massage at the dinner
table on a patio. I love his reaction to my statement that my toe hurts.
No invalidation. No melodrama. Just responsiveness. Precisely what is
missing in my emotional life with Emily.


"No matter what happens with us, don't go back to her, okay? You
deserve more." I nod in agreement.


ON THE INTERSTATE home from Atlanta, Evan stops talking about
breaking up with Leanne and starts talking about feeling guilty.


When I hear the words <i>I feel guilty</i> my insides go hot.


I look at him in disbelief. Like I don't know who he is. Like I could
not see this coming. I want to stick a pin in him to wake him up. I want
to slap him like they slap hysterical women in movies. I fold left arm
over right, dig four fingernails into the flesh facing out the passenger
side window.


"I'm sorry," he says when we get home. "I want to be with you. I
just can't. I can't do this to Leanne. This isn't the right time. I can't do
this. I want to. I can't."

[p. <i>167</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00168&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I stare out the window of the back door. I try to keep my mouth
closed but I hiss and sputter and spill over. I am whispering through the
dirt in my mouth.


I am BLOODROOT MORPHINE FEVER PRAYER.


I put my head on the kitchen counter and let tears and saliva pool
under my face. My crazy parts are showing and I don't care.


<i>I can't go through this again</i>.


<b>I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN</b>.


<b>I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN</b>.


<b>I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN</b>.


<b>I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN</b>.


He tucks me into bed, takes my swollen face in his hands, and
tongues salt from the insides of my mouth. I tell him I don't want him
to go. My face is cradled against his chest. I breathe in the scent of his
body through his <i>please don't eat birds</i> T-shirt. When he leaves I feel as if
I've been locked out of my house and can't get back in.


I take a blade from my bedside table drawer<br />
and set it down beside me.

[p. <i>168</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00169&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I call EMILY at work.


Tell her I need help.


She comes over and listens as I spill everything. The student.
The obsession. The panic. She reassures me that my indiscretion is
not life-and-death bad, not lose-your-job-if-you-get-found-out bad.
We spend the day together, drinking small glasses of whiskey and
melting back in love.


She tells me things I don't know how to absorb.


She loves me more than ever. She kissed another one of our coworkers
just weeks before she kissed me. It was a man. Lyle. <i>I knew it!</i> I wasn't
the first one she cheated with. I am stunned by this discovery.


"But you <i>were</i> the first one," she insists. "The first woman. The only
one who mattered."


I am cut to my core by the image of her with this man, whom I
had seen flirting with her in the hallways for months. I feel betrayed and
misled. We keep talking, trying to get somewhere, but by nine o'clock
that night, she has to go home.

[p. <i>169</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00170&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"I have a child," she reminds me.


<i>And a partner,</i> I think but don't say.


I make the pain go away by deciding I don't want her to stay. I go
in my bedroom and lock the door.


"JUST GET OUT!" Teeth bared, fists clinched.


She leaves and I rock back and forth<br />
with the razor blade in my hand.


I sit and cry and rock like I am rocking a baby in my lap. She is
inconsolable. I want to put the crying in a car and watch it roll into a
lake. I push the blade back and forth across the thin skin of my wrist.
I make one cut, then another right next to it, then another, each time
thinking <i>just one more</i>, but I don't stop. I line them up tightly, a series
of straight red wounds about two inches long covering my forearm from
wrist to inner elbow. It's not enough. I move the blade diagonally across
the ones closest to my wrist, carving a section of delicate cross-hatchings
that trail off at the curve of my arm, then push on around to the more
visible outer side.


<i>Yes</i>, I think, <i>Do it</i>.


<i>GIVE IN</i>.


<i>GO CRAZY</i>.


<i>I am not afraid</i>.

[p. <i>170</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have taken a dose of Xanax prescribed for stage fright. Instead of
making me relax and fall asleep it puts me in a trance. Books on pharmaceutical
treatments for borderline personality blacklist Xanax. It reduces
panic as we walk along the narrow canyon rim of self-annihilation. We
stare with stone eyes at our open skin.


I'm speaking in first person plural now. WE.


My voice sometimes splits into three parts.


The boy I miss is someone I barely know. A PLACEHOLDER and
STUNT DOUBLE. Our fast affair is an arena for tenderizing old twists of
emotion, to make them pliable enough to pass from my body. Until now
they hung forgotten from the rafters of my psyche, drying into tough
strips. Inedible bits of meat bereft of nutrients and hard as tree bark.
They mark my intestines with fissures and clog my elimination system.
Instead of getting the old feelings out I strain my abdomen and pass
nothing but blood. The tantrum of loving a sweet lost boy and then
losing him is triggered by a mass of displaced rage and guilt and shame
about a childhood crime I committed but was never convicted of.

TANTRUM BEHAVIOR CAN BE TRACED BACK<br />
TO CHILDHOOD RELATIONSHIPS WHERE AFFECTION<br />
WAS NEVER FREE OF CONFLICTFUL FEELING.


—THEODORE MILLON,<br />
<i>Personality Disorders in Modern Life</i>


I was eleven years old. I ABANDONED MY SISTERS.


I trained myself to say it was okay. It was not okay. I became my
own untrustworthy narrator. I told myself lies. I hid secrets like green
peas in air pockets in my lungs and hoped my lungs would not stop
breathing. I knew things I didn't want to know. I didn't want to know I
was not okay. I didn't want to know I was a liar.


I learned loss. ORPHAN. AMPUTEE. LONE WOLF from a PACK OF THREE.


I lost the closeness of nightly baths and shared neglect and small
comforts like the rough texture of clean terry cloth stretched across
Melissa's stomach under my palm. Melissa hardly knew me the first
time we saw each other after I moved in with our father. She was two. I
reached for her and she pulled back. Something broke inside me. I rode
with my father to pick up my sisters every other weekend but it was all

[p. <i>172</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Something strong is pouring out on the floor.


My sisters need me and I can't help them.


The pain is almost more than I can bear. All of us are grown
women now—thirty-seven, thirty-one, and twenty-eight—and we live
the chaos of attachment gone awry.


Second daughter in the birth order and six years younger
than I am, JESSICA structured her life around impossible
security. She loved women who wouldn't love her back.
Selfish women. Cruel women. Women with no interest
in becoming better people. She understood love as asymmetrical
and self-destructive. Picture her riding away in a
police car after trying to help her girlfriend run away from
the cops. Picture her slamming the door on her arm again
and again until a purple and green bouquet blooms on her
skin. Picture her closed up in her house taking this drug and
that drug, then convulsing on the floor and calling out for

And guess what?


<i>Her wicked wish comes true like cherry pie. Easy</i>.

[p. <i>174</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Our mother never sews anymore but in a one-in-a-million chance
of immaculate mutilation she pricks her finger on a broken spindle she
finds in the folds of her rose-covered comforter. The whole family falls
asleep—all of them—far and wide. Mother, sister, father, and cat fall
asleep. Stepmonster #1, stepmonster #2 both hear the alarm and both
hit snooze. Cousins catnap five counties over. Her imaginary friend
yawns like a girl who just wants to spoon but Jessica is too distracted
for kisses so the pretend friend flounces towards the door. <i>This is silly
I'm leaving</i>. Jessica tromps and snorts from one end of the Cracker Jack
box to the other and decides to bunker down in the bathroom. The tub
smokes and boils like her blood.


SHE WANTS TO BURN.


She wants more than 50 percent.


When her skin melts and twists she says <i>Good you deserve it bitch</i>.


She holds the waxy sign of her scars beneath the surface and watches
the words SAVE OUR SHIP break apart like old blisters. The rule of thumb
in her mental asylum is NO HOLDS BARRED. <i>Jessica is her own prisoner
of war and Geneva Conventions do not apply</i>. Water fills the cavities of her
face to simulate the sensation of drowning while the interrogation drones
on and on. She breaks down. Cries uncle. Offers up her virgin sister.
Sharpened tips of wild bamboo grow towards her naked chest.

[p. <i>175</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The door to the bathroom remains locked.


Our parents lick sugarplums from their lips in their sleep.


MY MOTHER DOES NOT do single well. She needs a man like a
superego to cork the bottle and put her to bed. Beyond the eyes of Big
Brother, she is all bulimia and bad credit. She hoards and gorges like
an orphan. The feeling of NO ONE IS LOOKING leaves her wild-eyed and
dazed by freedom. Jessica and Melissa grew up in one of the worst periods
of Mother's life. The eighties—era of neon shoelaces and matching
plastic earrings. Right around the time Harry met Sally our mother's
casual neglect crossed into criminal negligence. She ate Somas like Alka-Seltzers
and slurred her words so BRATS sounded like BRISS or BATS.
She passed out on the kitchen floor while cube steak popped and sighed
on the stove. My sisters thought she was mentally retarded.


They laughed and pointed.


Mother became crippled from rheumatoid arthritis in her thirties
and the diagnosis pleased her. It meant legitimate grounds for requesting
more narcotics from her doctor. By the time I reached my twenties, she
was ingesting a hundred pain pills a week. Minimum.

[p. <i>176</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

She almost let the house burn down around their ears.


She almost lost my sisters to the state.


Both sisters developed deformed coping mechanisms for the boredom
and self-loathing that comes from being parented by an addict.


My youngest sister MELISSA bears the grotesque beauty of
a splatter film. Bright colors. Sudden terrors. A blonde heroine
always losing her head, she moves through the world
spurting blood from the open mouth of her jagged neck.
She walks through walls and speedballs with zombies on the
other side. Her life is a piece of foreboding music in a minor
key. Here is what makes this story sad. Melissa was born
applejack sunbeam pure, hair like a platinum halo, smiling
like a Gerber baby at a photo shoot. She was two the day I
put her in a crib and followed my father out the door forever.
Twenty-five years later she still spits fire at our feet. Her life is
a wrecked boat torn apart for kindling and set ablaze to send
a message to the sky from a deserted beach.


From a distance the words spell SAVE ME.


The closer the sign the clearer the statement.


Turns out it says, FUCK YOU.

[p. <i>177</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

At twelve Melissa had not yet turned strange. The corner from
twelve to thirteen cut sharply to the side into an alley marked one-way.
She changed homes. She changed schools. She changed rules. She
changed friends. She kissed boys with bad teeth and racks in their trucks
for shotguns. She sidled up to manic girls with mothers who were maids
and shared cigarettes with thirteen-year-olds like best friends. Melissa
wanted to be a mother like that. Young and cool and devil-may-care. She
wanted to be a mother with kids who liked her. She believed popularity
required her to pop out her puppies while still of eligible age for homecoming
queen. She imagined trailing toddlers who would play entourage
to her starlet. She had sex without condoms and prayed Jesus would make
her pregnant. She is a sexual stunt driver more for dare than pleasure and
prides herself on having no boundaries in the area of intercourse.


"I give them whatever they want," she says.


She skipped NYMPHET and went straight for NYMPHO—AC/DC
from day one.


She picks sex partners like some people rescue cats. Boys with no
front teeth and their best skinny friends. Obese girls. Angry misfits
mud-riding in the middle of the night, hooting and yipping at fantasies
of parents shot in the face by escaped crazies from Bartow County

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Jessica yelled at Melissa to WAKE UP AND SMELL THE CRACK ROCK.
The con man was a liar and a thief throwing a party in her house
where people snorted profits for breakfast. Melissa nodded her head
and agreed to put the bad man out of her life forever. When Jessica
woke up, Melissa was gone like Sunday morning. Melissa's husband
went home, threw her things out the door, and set them on fire in the
yard. Melissa stayed gone for months. She came back pregnant with
the con man's son.


We held a white wedding in her ninth month.

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Melissa's second husband was equal parts methhead and fake minister.
He said the blessing when the family gathered for holiday dinners.
He took Melissa to a Church of God and taught her to speak in tongues.
The Holy Spirit came out of her mouth like a hot rail. My mother worried
the newlyweds would crush her skull with a stone one day to steal
the stockpile of Tylox from her storage closet.


Melissa came into the world with a SORCERER'S SKILLS. She waves
a wand and sings a song and makes you see what you want to believe.
She is exactly who you wish her to be. When she appears to me, Melissa
takes the form of a writer. Ten years ago she gave me a book of poetry
called <i>Oedipal Dreams</i>, by Evelyn Lau, a girl who ran away from home
and first published poems at twelve, spunky like a Chinese-Canadian
Melissa. At fourteen Lau ran away from home to become things her
family would not like.


ANARCHIST. PROSTITUTE. BULIMIC. VAGRANT.


Her titles provoke and harass.


<i>You Are Not Who You Seem. Choose Me. Other Woman</i>.

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

They could be titles for Melissa's life story. Or my own. The cover
art of <i>Oedipal Dreams</i> hits you like a cold splash of water. A ghost-white
face with two lips like pockets of blood ready to burst. When
Melissa loaned me <i>Oedipal Dreams</i> I flipped through the pages to see
if she had marked anything. I found a corner flipped down on a poem
titled "Father." Between our parents, our father was labeled the nicer one
because he was more naturally nurturing than our mother, but after he
and I split he became to the other sisters something more complex.


Intermittent refuge. Paradise out of reach. Mirage. TAUNT.


AS THE YEARS dragged on and the girls got bitter, they saw the worst
in him. ABANDONER. REFUSER. <i>First-daughter favorer</i>. He became
their story of what might have been. Their lives were love poems to him
<i>Take us with you</i> and his taillights in their driveway answered in the slam
poetry of NO.


For my sisters, our father is the parent who hurt them. They feel
as nervous about standing near him as I do about standing near our
mother. Easy to villainize the one you don't live with. The other parent
becomes the bad object, a convenient storage unit for boxes of reasons
why we are the way we are. They remove the pressure to examine the

you stand cold as a vision<br />
you leave me<br />
I push you through glass doors in my dreams<br />
through skylights<br />
my father with the dark face, you appear more<br />
handsome<br />
in dreams than in life, I hold up to you the handle<br />
of a child's mirror


Lau's poems are slivers and sores and spent bullets. A landscape
of needles, broken glass, open flesh, ashes, and amitriptyline, an atmosphere
resembling the set of a movie Jessica once loaned me, featuring
characters desperate for love, settling for heroin. I recognize this world
my sisters paint on the walls around them. I have a history of seeking out
music and films and novels that allow me to work from a distance with
the dynamics of my own unclaimed hurting.

DOESN'T TAKE MUCH<br />
TO RIP US INTO PIECES, I sang every day for a year.


If Melissa were a book of poems, her back cover would say the same
thing Lau's book says. "These are raw, angry poems." I can see the words
inscribed across her shoulder blades in gothic letters as if she's a girl in
a street gang.


<i>Melissa is a raw angry poem</i>.


The poem says TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME NOW.


The poem says HOW CAN I JUST LET YOU WALK AWAY? LET YOU
LEAVE WITHOUT A TRACE?


Sweet like syrup of ipecac, she leaves my system with my guts in
her hands.


She wants me to know how it feels to be weak and empty. I wish
Melissa had become a defiant punk rock street girl poet like Evelyn Lau
with an instinct for self-preservation and a notebook full of rage. Instead
she dropped acid. She dropped high school. She dropped her sharp poet
mind like a bad habit. She dropped out of touch for years, reappearing
occasionally as a hysterical phone call or fifteen urgent text messages
sent in the middle of the night while I slept. My great-grandfather used
to say my spine would grow crooked from holding Melissa on my hip

"TO LIVE A LIFE analogous to a soap opera is to live the life of a
borderline personality," says psychologist Theodore Millon. The soap
opera makes some people dislike us—we are BIRDDOGS, BULLIES,
BULLSHITTERS, BAD CHARACTERS—but the soap opera is a symptom.
Fireworks splatter across the sky. People in the audience look up at the
bright spectacle and can't believe their eyes.


There are reasons for emotional dysregulation.


There are reasons for drinking and cutting, for smoking meth
and lighting fires. There is a story that makes sense of all this. Nerve
damage and nightmare and nostalgia. A tiny kernel beneath twelve
layers of down.


The borderline digs with razor blades, glass slivers, toenail clippers,
her own rough nails. Even she is hard pressed to put a finger on it.

BORDERLINES CREATE THE VICIOUS CIRCLES<br />
THEY FEAR MOST. THEY BECOME ANGRY AND DRIVE<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE BREAKING POINT,<br />
THEN SWITCH TO A POSTURE OF HELPLESSNESS<br />
AND CONTRITION, BEG FOR RECONCILIATION.<br />
IF BOTH PARTIES ARE EQUALLY ENMESHED,<br />
CHAOS AND CONFLICT BECOME THE<br />
SOUL OF THE RELATIONSHIP.

<i>Personality Disorders in Modern Life</i>


At the time of the first cut back in December—Emily's initials on
the bone-thin skin of my ankle—I think I am the only one going crazy,
the only woman over thirty marking up her skin with desperate words
like <i>I love you, I need you</i> in a warped daisy chain across the top of her
foot. I have no idea I am not alone. I have no idea about the company
I'm in. All my favorite writers are cutting themselves. All my favorite
students are cutting themselves. A man I will sleep with six months from
this night is carving the Chinese symbol for NO into his thigh with a
knife. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> will call self-cutting a college
epidemic. People will make documentaries about it.

MY FAVORITE CELEBRITY DOUBLE Lisa Lopes was not just a
pyromaniac. She was also a cutter. She sat in her room at Charter
Peachford hospital in Atlanta, mind spinning from the fight and the
fire and the aftermath of alcohol abuse treatment. She carved the word
<b>LOVE</b> in her forearm from elbow to wrist and later obscured it with its
twin emotion—<b>HATE</b>—the letters wider and pushed deeper into the
skin. Strong feelings came to her as texts on the body that could only
be read one at a time. Scholars call these neurotic mutilations ORGANIC
REACTIONS TO PATHOLOGICAL LEVELS OF TENSION AND ANXIETY.


This is the "pride in the power of self-destruction" that psychologist
Otto Kernberg writes about in <i>Borderline Conditions and Pathological
Narcissism</i>. It is the RADICAL FREEDOM of refusing self-preservation
and instead bringing blade to skin. It is about the relaxing of vigilance,
like taking a harsh drink or a tab of acid. Holding myself rigid with
attention to other people's moods and preferences, the relentless effort to
win someone over with charm and merits, the ongoing work of building
a career and forming a life—all this effort just stops for a minute with
the glass of whiskey and razor blade.

The choice to cut is a signal.


I <i>am not trying any more. I am taking a break from doing my best</i>.


The symptom is a window into deep-rooted anxieties, psychotic
but not inexplicable. The girl with the broken glass in her hand splits
into three parts. She is the parent who hurt her. She is the child who got
hurt. She is the parent who failed to protect her. There are reasons why
a college professor in her early thirties would sit in her study and slice
up her own arm.


TO EASE TENSION; TO EXPRESS EMOTIONAL PAIN;<br />
TO PUNISH THE BODY FOR ITS HISTORY OF<br />
SEXUAL ABUSE, TO ALLEVIATE INNER RAGE,<br />
TO EXPRESS SHAME, TO PROVIDE BIOCHEMICAL RELIEF.


—MARILEE STRONG, <i>A Bright Red Scream</i>


This last one—biochemical relief—rings truest for me. The cutting
is the rebel yell of a body being bombed by implicit memories in the
midst of current attachment conflicts.


A storm of emotions.


A tantrum.


Scorched earth.

IN EVERYDAY LIFE IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN<br />
SOME RESPITE FROM MODERATELY HEIGHTENED<br />
LEVELS OF TENSION AND ANXIETY THROUGH<br />
SUCH METHODS AS INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,<br />
ORGASM, MEDITATION, AND MUSCLE RELAXATION.<br />
BUT WHEN TENSION AND ANXIETY REACH TRULY<br />
PATHOLOGICAL LEVELS, NONE OF THESE METHODS HAS<br />
MUCH EFFECT. AN ACT OF SELF-MUTILATION, HOWEVER,<br />
MAY BE QUITE EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING THE TENSION<br />
AND ANXIETY. ONE EXPLANATION FOR THIS EFFECT<br />
RELATES TO THE PROBLEMATIC THEORY OF "PSYCHIC ENERGY."<br />
BRIEFLY STATED, THIS THEORY HOLDS THAT THE MIND-BRAIN<br />
SYSTEM OPERATES BEST WITHIN A CERTAIN RANGE OF<br />
TENSION LEVELS. IF THE LEVEL GETS TOO HIGH,<br />
THE MIND-BRAIN SYSTEM WILL OPERATE AUTOMATICALLY<br />
TO DIVEST ITSELF OF "QUANTITIES OF EXCITATION."


—ARMANDO FAVAZZA, <i>Bodies Under Seige</i>


The self-cutting a seizure, the body resets its own buttons.


The cutting is a sign. The anxious adult child of an addict with her
codependent can-do spirit screaming, <i>I cannot do it. I cannot make things
work out after all</i>.

In one of the few memoirs of self-injury, Caroline Kettlewell
describes her recovery in terms of neural pathways—the "groove" worn
into her mind, the "wrong turns and dark corridors" marked by her
history of cutting. Once she learns how to stand "the awful agony of
unhappiness" without reverting to the bodily jolt of broken skin, she
changes the map of psychological struggle in her mind. "[E]very time I
gut it through and survive," she concludes, "I'm reshaping the structure
and the chemistry of my thoughts, wearing new paths less tortured and
convoluted than the old ones."


Cutting is considered the litmus test of the borderline personality.


If you do it, you are it. Of course being / becoming / defining borderline
is not that simple. People cut for other reasons.


Four years from the night I scalp my forearm, a twenty-two-year-old
woman named Dominique Fisher in England will be brought up
on charges for carving her name into the skin of her lover's arm
with a Stanley knife during what newscasters called a drunken
fling. They were high on cocaine. They had sex. He tried to steal
things from her flat. When she reported him for theft, he countered
with the evidence of her text on his body, and then she was
the one in trouble. Pre-sentencing reports called her A VERY ISOLATED

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387558-I00190&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

You ask too much. You risk addiction.


You fill your mouth with figs.


YOU MAY FACE TIME IN JAIL.


The girl scrivener named Dominique Fisher was found guilty of
UNLAWFUL WOUNDING. She got served with a suspended sentence, two
years of community service, and a stern warning not to take pears from
strange goblins.


SUCH STRANGE THINGS MUST NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.


TONIGHT MY MIND is a tornado alley. I scan the June-dark sky. I
want the day to stay bright. I want to be higher than high. I want to be
peaking all the time. Ella Fitzgerald says spring can really hang you up
the most. I picture a noose. I picture my body as strange fruit. Abandonment
depression steps to you sudden and mean, and when you have
it, spring sounds nothing like the smooth plum silk of a jazz singer's

<i>Get out of your house before something breaks<br />
inside you</i>.


<i>I will leave Emily, leave town, leave this lethal wanting<br />
behind soon or else I will die here</i>.


Eventually I put the blade away and go calmly to bed.


My arm burns all night long like I ran it under scalding water.


I teach class in a sleeveless dress the next day. My face is calm, my
smile earnest, the stripes on my arms like exclamation marks punctuating
my lecture.


NICE GIRL. RESPONSIBLE WOMAN. NURTURING TEACHER.


The facades break apart.


A madwoman bursts through the seams. I sit at a pub near campus
and sip whiskey to kill time before therapy.
