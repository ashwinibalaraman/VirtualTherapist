no evil can happen to a good man, either

PLATO


DESPAIR, despair, oppressive and sometimes fatal, reared its
ugly head one foggy morning in London. Despair to the point
of death. The London fog added to the cloak of impending doom
that settled over the township of Wembley, a small suburban
area on the outskirts of what Cockneys affectionately call
London—the "Big Smoke."


Doom, death, for a man who had just decided that death
would be preferable to living out his remaining years in a mental
institution. I'm sick, frightened, discouraged—there is no point
in going on. My wife and children—what will happen to them?
Psychoneurotic—what in the hell is that? I can't eat well, can't
sleep at night. This has been going on for a year, and the doctor
says "psychoneurotic," I can't concentrate on my work; things
are going badly on the job. So tired all the time. The sleeping
pills only make me feel worse the next day, as though I'm
drugged. I've tried to hide how sick I am from Mary—wonderful

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00012&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now I must leave her and the children forever. Better a dead
father and husband than one locked up in the lunatic asylum for
the rest of his life. Children, not realizing that their special
brand of cruelty would break Freddie's and Sharon's hearts,
taunting them about a crazy father.


All the bills are paid, so there are no debts. Being the wife
of an Air Force officer, she would be entitled to a death gratuity,
and Social Security benefits would afford them a living. She
could start her life again and remarry. Better that I am out of
the way completely. Mother and Dad, so strong and faithful
through the years. One son dead in Korea, and the other about
to take his own life. Better that than having the last son a
vegetating idiot in a mental institution.


It takes some months for a mind to conceive the thought of
suicide and actually come to the point of doing it. While on
a recent trip to Switzerland, I toyed with the idea of purchasing
a gun. Mary's father, uncle, and Mary and I went on what I felt
sure to be my last holiday with her. The gun as a means of dispatching
myself was rejected in favor of a more painless and
restful way. With a gun there would be noise, blood, a ghastly
corpse; better some form of poison. What about the children-
a son and a daughter? They are only babies and don't know
their daddy too well yet. She will get a new daddy for them.
I hope he will be kind and will love them.


I could attach a hose to the exhaust of the car and close
the garage, but then Mary would be suspicious if I went to the
garage and she did not hear the car leave. I just don't know
what to do. I've informed Major Freeman that I don't know
which way to turn; in fact, I'm so confused that I'm completely
lost. It was Major Freeman, the brilliant Jewish internal-medicine
specialist, who sent me to the base psychiatrist, a head

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00013&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I'm frightened all the time and can't do my work well. What
should I do? His reply was: "You're psychoneurotic, and it will
take a long time and many sessions with a doctor to get at
the solution of the problem." "How about you, doctor? Can't
you see me? I'm rather desperate." "Sorry, I'm all booked with
patients, and it will take a long time to effect a cure for you."
Leaving his office in such a frightened state, I forgot to be angry
about what appeared to be such a cold, detached attitude.


Perhaps Major Freeman could help. I went to his office and
again had an interview with him. By this time Freeman was
convinced that I was a candidate for the "looney pen." "I'm
losing weight and can't eat or sleep. What must I do, Dr.
Freeman?" He replied something or other about seeing a psychiatrist
and having faith and the guts necessary to accomplish
the cure. From Dr. Freeman's office I went to a mental hospital
on the outskirts of London, St. Albans.


Driving in the fog to see an even colder man than the base
psychiatrist. I am feeling very badly now. My legs are numb and
very cold as I lie on the couch and begin telling the doctor how
I feel. "I have been coming to you every day for three months
now, doctor, and I still feel no better. Please do something to
help me. My heart feels as if it is going to jump out of my chest"
The doctor's reply was: "I'll give you some sleeping pills to help
you sleep." At this point I made my decision to end it all. After
the trip I thought: Take her to Switzerland and then do it.


The four of us left England by channel ferry and arrived in
Belgium. After a short motor trip, we arrived in Brussels. The
1958 World's Fair was just terminating. We did, however,
manage to get into the fair grounds and see the efforts that so

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I could not enjoy the trip, since I had decided the end must
come immediately on our return to England. I was numb with
depression and fear. This trip was my small concession to conscience.
I felt we should have a last holiday together. No
expense was spared, and we ate in the most expensive restaurants
and quartered at the finest hotels.


We toured parts of Germany, stopping for a three-day visit
in Munich. Mary was interested in touring the city with her
relatives, but I could not summon up the necessary energy. We
had come to Germany in time for the October <i>Fest</i>. At this
time of year all of Germany celebrates the harvest. Tents are
put up in various cities and towns, and the beer flows freely.
Our last night in Munich we visited the Hofbrau, a famous beer
hall, and then left for Garmisch, the winter playground, Mary
especially wanted to see the city famous for the "Passion Play,"
Oberammergau.


From there we went to Zurich, Switzerland, then back to
Paris. It had been a good trip for them. Too bad I could not
enjoy it.


The trip was over now, and I must do what I had to do.
Sixteen sleeping pills—that amount should do a beautiful job.
The pills and the gas from the jet in the living room. Together
they would constitute a painless method. Now, in the black of
night, the children and Mary are in bed. Now is the appointed
time to meet the grim messenger of death. It's not particularly
hard to swallow sixteen sleeping tablets. In fact, there were no
lumps, no sticking in the throat, as they went down. How long
will it be before I get so sleepy that I can't move? Not long, so
I had better be near the gas jet and turn that on before I can
no longer move. The jet is so easy to turn, just a little pressure
clockwise, and listen to the hiss of escaping gas.


So sleepy now. It's not painful; in fact, kind of pleasant. A

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary left in a few minutes. While she was there I remember
experiencing an intense feeling of guilt that I would have to
hurt her again so soon. I looked around the room and saw an
unguarded window. Since I was being watched so closely, there
would be no chance of getting my hands on any more drugs to
do the job. I decided that the windowpane would do the job
well, so I flung myself at the window. Before losing consciousness,
I remember a colored nurse struggling with me, trying to
stop the flow of blood coming from the gash in my right arm.


After this attempt to end the despair unto death, the hospital
authorities sent me to the psychiatric hospital at Burdrop Park,
England, where there are ample facilities to protect a patient,
and give adequate treatment for the mentally ill. The ambulance
ride to this hospital was agonizing. My arm hurt terrifically; the
pain was excruciating. A red-hot knife was searing my right arm.
"Hurry! Hurry!" I screamed. "Do something for the arm!" The
next time I awakened, there were tubes running everywhere,
and I could not bend my arm. Only this time I was hot, so hot
that I felt I was burning up. I was in a small room with
a lock on the door, and someone seemed to be sitting beside me.
There was a tube that was attached to my penis, and it hurt
I do not know how long I stayed in that small room, about the
size of a berth in a pullman car.

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When I was taken out of the room I was placed in a wheel
chair as I could not walk. The day room, as it is called in psychiatric
wards and mental hospitals, is a room where patients
sit and read, daydream, and otherwise occupy themselves during
the day. I looked out the window and saw bars. I looked to
my right and a little way down the hall I saw a door. It was
kept locked. So this was the "looney pen," I thought. I felt
trapped. As my mind began to clear of the effects of the drugs,
I heard a woman's voice. She was screaming as though all the
demons of hell were after her. I shook my head to clear it, but
the screaming persisted. The noise was coming from behind me.
I turned and saw a locked steel door with a peephole about
head high, the height of a normal person. The sound was coming
from behind that door. I was on a locked ward for seriously
disturbed psychiatric patients. Patients were around the room.
Some talking, some walking up and down, some just sitting. In
the middle of the room there was an enclosed glass room. In
it sat a nurse and a Negro attendant. This was the nurses' station.


I looked down at my arm, and the hand was bent at a right
angle to my arm in a cast. I tried to move my fingers and they
worked. (I was later to understand and gratefully appreciate the
knowledge and professional skill that went into restoring the
function of an arm that was severely cut through the tendons,
muscles, blood vessels, and ulnar nerve.) Well, this really does
it, doesn't it? A dentist whose right arm is mangled, I thought,
is absolutely useless.


Down the hall and beyond the door I heard a rattling and
clatter that I could not account for. In a moment the door
opened and two corpsmen came in, pushing a huge dolly filled
with food trays. "Even the ‘nuts’ have to eat, don't they?" someone
said. The nurses and corpsmen placed the trays around the
room, and the patients ate. I wasn't hungry. Locked doors and
windows and locked rooms at night. The only way a fellow can
kill himself here is to starve himself to death. And that is what
I resolved to do, not reckoning with the burly charge nurse
on duty, nor knowing that all eyes were on you, and that they

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During this time I was in a wheel chair and could not walk
very well. When I would go to the bathroom, accompanied by
an attendant, I would stumble and lurch along. (I was to learn
three years later that the drugs given some mental patients
cause all sorts of symptoms that imitate other disorders of the
central nervous system.) Needless to say, it is very embarrassing
to have someone with you while you attend to your personal
and private needs in a bathroom; that, however, is exactly what
happens. You are watched everywhere you go in the limited
space available. Later, I was to observe other patients going
through this hell of nurse and attendant instituting suicidal
precaution for patients.


The drugs used for controlling the patients caused a host of
side reactions, ranging from protrusion of the tongue, disturbances
in vision, drooling, ataxic gait to gastrointestinal disorders.
All this is terribly frightening to the patient, who by then is
convinced that he really is "cuckoo." When the patient takes a
drug and the result is a hallucination, he is really convinced that
he is so far from the state of normality that he can never return
to it.


Movies were being shown on the ward during the time I
was in the wheel chair, and as I was looking at the picture
through drugged eyes, my head suddenly began to jerk forward.
I could not control the movements. I was thinking of being
punished in hell when my head seemed to be pulled back by
some terrible force, and I screamed the word "forever." I tried
desperately not to utter a sound, but the word rolled out like
a clap of thunder.


Most patients, I was later to learn, never discuss these hallucinations
with the doctors out of fear. In my case, after a particularly

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had, in one week, dreams or delusions, during a semicomatose
state, of my children and wife being dead, and even saw
Freddie and Sharon being interred in their graves with their
infant clothes on. I believed that I was responsible for their
death. One night I dreamed that the children's heads were full
of cotton. The next night I hallucinated that Mary and the
children were posing for a picture, and there was a radiant
halo around each one's head, as though they were saints. The
hallucination that triggered the third attempt at suicide came
during a group-therapy meeting. The patients, doctors, and
nurses were outside in the Day Room. My room was locked,
and in my hallucination I was lying on the operating table and
doctors were cutting me up. I actually saw myself being literally
cut to pieces, and I was beginning to feel the pain of scalpels
doing their deadly job of separating skin and tendon. At this
point I stood on my bed with my arms at my side and dived
off on my head. Fate was to prove kind to me even this time. I
was knocked unconscious, but when I awakened the pictures
were gone, and that terrible pain in my head and back was
there. I did not tell the doctors that I had done this. When they
found me on the cement floor by my bed, I did complain of my
back hurting, which was to bother me for the next few years.


I lapsed into unconsciousness, and it was during this period
of delirium caused by the blow to my head that I had dreams
and hallucinations of a religious nature. Visions of the cross
and two saints praying for me. Although I did not know this at
the time, it would subsequently lead me to a religious orientation
later. I was to learn two years later that at this crucial
time of my illness my parents, devoutly religious, had started
a program of intercessory prayer for me, and that priests, alerted
by my family physician, began to say mass for me around the
clock.


After this adventure of diving head first from the bed to the

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was given my medication (the doctors were unaware that
I had purposely dived head first onto the floor) and sometime
later had horrible hallucinations of being fed diseased tissues
taken from patients who had recently died. I sat in the wheel
chair and screamed.


All this time my faithful Mary was trying her best to bear
up under the strain, and although the doctors would not let
her see me in this condition, she somehow managed to keep
going with the household chores and the children.


This time I really had to learn to walk all over again. It
took me about two weeks to get my legs coordinated with the
rest of my body, and though my back hurt, it was not broken.
My vertebral column was injured, and the first and second vertebrae
would be fused together as a result of the blow and the
healing processes. During this period, one evening, patients from
the open ward (a ward that extends some freedom to patients,
in that they may walk to other places in the hospital and are
not under close observation) were coming back from the snack
bar. I began to hallucinate just as they were coming from a hallway
that connected the outside ward with our locked one. I
saw a picture of Mary bringing the children to see me, and
all the while she was trying to get me to see them, but I would
not look at them. I got out of the wheel chair and ran to the
door, just as the other patients were coming in, and I remember

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Soon the attendants and nurses thought I was rational and
lucid enough to have my first interview with the psychiatrist.
I could walk now, though not very briskly, for I felt weak. I
was ushered into the doctor's office and settled in a chair by the
desk. As all my previous sessions had been with an English
doctor while lying down, I felt this doctor was all wrong, and
proceeded to tell him so. He asked me how I felt. I could feel
something boring into my back and I was in a great deal of
pain, but I did not tell him. Instead, I kept saying, "I've killed
them" referring to the children and Mary. My previous hallucinations
had convinced me that they would die because of me.
The doctor, of course, recognized my delusions. We were not
able to communicate too well; in fact, to my later regret I did
not talk to doctors very much during this period of my illness.


By now I was well enough to see my wife, who came down
in the ambulance from the Air Force base in London. I was so
glad to see her! She was very brave, strong, and straight, and
immediately won the hearts of doctors, nurses, attendants and
patients alike, with her optimism about my getting well and
back to work. We had a pleasant visit, although I was very
ashamed and deeply embarrassed. I seemed to sense the male
patients and attendants thinking: Why would he want to kill
himself with a beautiful girl like that for a wife? I felt tired,
so I went to my room and lay down to rest, since I did not feel
like talking. Mary stayed and talked to a patient who was a
staff internist's wife. Soon she left, and I cried bitter tears of
regret, loneliness, and heartbreak. I lay on the bed, and the
tears flowed. I had been too arrogant and proud to cry in front
of the nurses and patients. A bitter lesson of pride going before
a fall, I was to later learn.

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The doctors by this time had decided to send me back to
America, where I could get further and more extensive treatment.
Mary was told that she would be taken back to the States
with the children. They would go back to her father's home
in Hampton, Virginia, and await my arrival in the States. She and
I, by this time, had talked several times on the phone and our
relationship was good.


I was not sleeping well at night, and had to take chloral
hydrate at bedtime to insure that I got some rest; the drug
caused a terrific hangover the next day. I remember not taking
the medicine that was given me, for I did not know what it
was, and the dreams that doctors were cutting me up had made
me deathly afraid of any treatment that I did not know anything
about. I would take the medicine and put it in my mouth and
pretend to swallow it, a practice many patients follow, and
the nurses have constantly to stay on guard to see that their
charges take the medicine. If patients don't swallow their pills,
and are caught, they are given liquids, and if they rebel at that
they are given the needle by force, if necessary, and sometimes
it is.


Six weeks after I entered this hospital, the cast was taken
off my arm, and to the doctor's amazement the arm worked.
I didn't care whether it did or not. What would a dentist need
his right arm for, if he couldn't be a dentist? For the next weeks,
while waiting for my name to come up for transportation back
to the States, I was taken daily to the physical-therapy section
of the hospital, and the charge nurse exercised my hand till she
got it working, and I could use my stiff fingers again. I give her
the credit, because if she had not performed the exercises for
me, I would not have done so.


A week before I was to leave for the States by hospital plane,
I had a series of dreams that I shall relate. Mary and the children
had been taken back to the States now, and she had telegraphed
that she was well and safe. I dreamed one night that I was in
the air and floating on my back and an awesome face with
a beard was blowing the clouds that were carrying me along.

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The second dream was a series of recurring dreams. I
dreamed that I was by the edge of a desert island and slowly
sinking underneath the surface of the water. Mary came to my
rescue by extending her hand. She was lifting me up out of
the water, and behind her there was coiled a small black serpent
that struck her, and behind that snake there was coiled a large,
no, a huge black snake. After the snake there were two paths,
one leading to health, happiness and success and the other
to hospitals, jails, disgrace and sickness. Finally I was on the
top of a high hill with a mansion behind me and with children
around me. The third dream showed Mary standing beside her
father and she was pregnant and was laughing at me.


The fourth dream showed me in a church. I was dying and
in this dream Mary was hysterical. Her face seemed contorted
with hate.


The next week I was placed on a stretcher with my bedroom
shoes at my feet, and carried to an ambulance, and from
there to a plane which was on its way to Germany to pick up
other patients who were to be flown back to the States. I stayed
at this hospital in Germany on the locked ward, waiting for
space on another plane going back to America.


Before I left the last hospital, a woman placed a Bible in my
hand and asked me to read it. While waiting for the plane,
I began to read it, though not with too much understanding.
At this hospital there was a dining room on the locked ward,
and the old routine was broken by leaving the Day Room three
times a day and going to this room to eat. We also went every
day up the stairs to a game room, where we played ping-pong
and checkers and the like, and made pocketbooks and painted.


Every morning the patients would stand by their beds while
the doctors made their rounds, asking you how you felt, and
I felt so ashamed that I would turn my head away from them.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The plane carried us to a base in the Azores, and there we
showered, shaved, ate and spent the night again locked up. By
this time I had developed a hearty appetite and really looked
forward to mealtime, about the only thing to look forward to.
The next morning the patients were loaded on the plane, and
the patients who enjoyed locked-ward status were again tied
to their bunks in the rear of the plane. The other patients, those
whose ailments ran the gamut from T.B. to heart disease, filed
into the plane and to their seats, and we were again off on
a ten— to twelve-hour journey. I kept wondering as the plane
sped along high above the clouds whether or not, if the plane
crash landed, the nurses would unstrap the seriously disturbed
psychiatric patients. Meals were served on top of the stretchers,
and an attendant accompanied you to the restroom, standing
with one foot in the door and watching you while you
attended to nature's necessities.


The nurse came by at intervals and gave Thorazine to make
the patients so tranquil that one could not move even if one
wanted to. The flight was pleasant as the plane landed at
McGuire Air Force Base, where other planes were waiting to
carry the patients to military hospitals nearest their homes
that had the particular kind of service available that they
needed.


I was placed aboard a plane whose destination was Headquarters
Command Hospital, Andrews Air Force Base, Washington,
D.C. After a flight of approximately one hour we touched
down at Andrews. At this hospital I would begin the slow and
painful steps that doctors hoped would restore me to reality and
a useful productive life. The hospital was very modem and
built in the shape of a "T." The neurological and psychiatric

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The food here was also better, and the patients had a choice
of meats and desserts. The next day would begin my physical
examination and psychological testings. From my room that
night I could see the planes parked on the runway. The night
was very long, as I lay and looked at the ceiling and felt terribly
afraid.


Next morning, I was carried to the psychologist's office. He
asked me about my children and wife and wanted to know if
they needed any financial help. I said no, since Mary was
getting my Air Force check. I was feeling so guilty about Mary
and the children that I said I was a demon, partly because, the
previous night as I dozed off early in the morning, I either
dreamed or hallucinated that I was a black shadow surrounded
by a ring of fire. A terrifying experience!


I went back to the closed ward escorted by a Negro attendant
and sat in a chair and tried to read something or other.
Being filled with drugs and tranquilizers in the particular concentration
that I was getting caused me to feel absolutely limp.
I only felt like sitting down. I had not been keeping track of
the days, so I asked the nurse what day it was. It was now
March, the first of the month, 1959. I had been incarcerated for
three and one-half months.

[p. <i>27</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That afternoon, I saw the doctors making their rounds, and
the one who would be my doctor moving slowly and deliberately
toward the nurses' station with some records. His name was Dr.
Robert Bill, a man so profound in medical and psychiatric knowledge
that it would take two years for me to fully understand
what he would subsequently say to me, in trying to guide my
tortured mind back to an even keel.


Another sleepless night for me. The patient next door, a
Negro airman, was passing the night screaming and shouting
and saying, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. You're right, Lord." I was to
understand later that he had been a victim of visual and auditory
hallucinations.


The next morning, after showering and shaving, breakfast
was brought to the ward, and the patients ate. A few patients
on the locked ward were allowed to leave and go to the main
dining area on the first floor, where all other ambulatory patients
ate who were allowed to leave their respective wards.
Today was the day I was to see my doctor, as at eleven o'clock
I had an appointment.


I was escorted to Dr. Robert Bill's office by a corpsman, and
ushered in. Dr. Bill sat smiling pleasantly. He introduced himself,
and asked me how I felt. Since the records indicated that
I was scared to death, I felt he should have known I felt
frightened. I was still foolishly going through a period of distrust
of psychiatrists, and I did not talk very much to him. In
retrospect, since I am naturally garrulous, this indicated how
sick I was. He soon dismissed me, sending me back to the ward,
since I was not cooperating with him. That afternoon I was taken
to the psychologist's office and given a battery of tests, among
them the ink-blot, or Rorschach, test and given some pictures
and told to write a story about what they meant to me and
how I felt when I saw them. At the time all this did not make
any sense. I cooperated as best I could, this time.


I was then given passages of writing to read and a series of
numbers to read and remember. The last test was completed that
afternoon, and I was exhausted by the time I returned to the

[p. <i>28</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The patients spent their evenings watching television, doing
crossword puzzles, playing ping-pong, and just plain talking.
It was a long time from dinner to lights out at ten o'clock. A
lot of my time was spent talking to nurses, who, I was to learn
later, wrote down every word that I uttered.


My nights were spent as usual in the agony of sleeplessness,
and wondering why this illness had happened to me. At this time
I did not consider the myriads of others who had gone through
the same suffering, and had destroyed themselves because of
this very considerable agony they were placed in.


The next morning, all patients were roused at six o'clock as
usual and took their showers, and the long day of emptiness
began again. Breakfast on the ward, and after that just sitting
and trying to forget where you are. You look at the other
patients, some sitting and some even rolling on the floor, and you
think: I'm not crazy. I am not like that. But there you are, locked
up just like the rest of them. There really isn't very much to
read on a ward like this, although Red Cross employees bring
a dolly of books for the patients twice a week. Ward movies
twice a week afford some moments of pleasure, in that, while
you are looking at them, you forget temporarily your present
circumstances. Patients from the open ward come in and out,
visiting all day. Some of them come over to play us cards or
visit the nurses and attendants. All day long seems to be one
long card session of bid whist. At eleven o'clock all ambulatory
patients are taken up the long hall to a patio on the roof, which
is fenced in, and where those who feel like it play volley ball.
I never seemed to have energy enough to play. So I sat and

[p. <i>29</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This afternoon I saw my doctor again. I just sat there
stupidly, not saying anything, and feeling very embarrassed and
acutely ashamed. I was to learn later that it takes quite some
time to establish rapport with a psychiatrist, and to feel that one
can tell all or spill your guts, as it were. I was escorted back to
the ward and through the locked door by an attendant, who, as it
turned out, was sick—in fact, three weeks later he killed his
pregnant wife. An act of love, I believe the psychiatrist called it.


There was nothing at all to do on the ward but sit or stand
and look out the window. Reading was very difficult, as it was
exceedingly hard to concentrate for any length of time. However,
I had the Bible that the kind woman had given me in Europe,
and I began to read it. "In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth." I had begun a practice that would develop
through later months and years into a source of comfort and
strength, for what I now hope will be for the rest of my life.
I had begun to get acquainted with the thoughts of some very
wise men indeed.


That night after dinner a nurse informed me that a good
friend of mine had arrived, and asked if I wanted to see him.
I thought this question was infantile, but I later learned that
many patients do not want to see friends or relatives or those
that love them the most. This has a terribly disquieting effect
upon the loved ones of the mentally ill patient, as they find it
difficult to understand why the patient, whom they love and
who loves them, does not want to see them. My friend was
admitted to the ward, and as it had been four years, when we
left school, since I had seen him, it was like old times. We greeted
each other with the words, "Muh Nigger"—a term that was used
frequently in our group of friends and associates to denote closeness
and sameness of outlook toward life, a word that, if used by
white persons, would inflame us to the point of battle. Since
Dr. Sam Peet was an M.D. himself, he was very tactful, and
asked how I felt and inquired about my family and the "young

[p. <i>30</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sam left, after visiting hours were up, and I knew then that
all my old friends in Washington knew that I was on the
"nut" ward at a military hospital, a fact that a large majority of
patients and relations foolishly try to hide. That night as I sat,
my head felt as if it would pop off, and I felt an urgent necessity
to scream, but I didn't. I also evidently was still hallucinating,
because I saw a picture of a woman and a baby, and the baby
was trying to return to the womb, and that baby was me.
I had regressed to the infantile level and wanted to cease to exist,
though I had put all thoughts of suicide out of my mind.


By this time I had gone without sleep for such long periods
of time that I decided to chance the drug hangover I would feel
the next day and asked the nurse for a sleeping pill. I was given
chloral hydrate at bedtime that night, and felt as though a
curtain was being pulled about my head. I had been in this
hospital for one month.


The next day Dr. Bill informed me that I would be given
semiopen ward privileges. That meant I could leave the ward
without an escort and go downstairs to eat in the main dining
room, and all I had to do was to get the nurse to open the door
and I could go down to the library and snack bar. While we were
talking, I noted on his desk my file, and it was turned to a page
that stated that I was an acute schizophrenic with suicidal and
homicidal tendencies. I had no idea at the time that this designation,
or label, meant that I would be considered dangerous at a
later date. I had forgotten that in my delirium at a previous hospital
I had foolishly said to a doctor that I had killed my wife
and children or was responsible for their death.

[p. <i>31</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00029&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That week Mary drove up from Hampton, Virginia, to see
me. I was so happy to see her, and she looked wonderful. The
children were fine and all my relatives had asked for me. I was
not allowed to leave the floor with her, but I could visit in the
lounge for visitors with her. She had written the Air Force,
and they informed her where I was. During all this time I did
not write or call her or my parents; for that matter, I did not
realize that my lack of concern for my condition and my apathy
were causing a terrific strain on all those who loved me. I was
not very good company, but she was optimistic for my recovery
and appeared to be in good spirits. She had relatives in Washington,
and living accommodations were not a problem for her.
She told me that her dad had asked if they had done anything to
precipitate my attempt at suicide, since I attempted it immediately
after her dad and uncle had left Europe. I assured her that
they had not, and we had a wonderful visit. I felt extremely tired
all the time, however, and could not act very energetic or enthusiastic
about her. I felt she understood. She had a series of
talks with the doctors and charge nurse and came to see me
every day during the week end. When she left, I was again alone.


By this time the doctor and I had established some rapport,
and I began to talk more freely with him. We talked about everything
that I thought of, a process called "free association" in
psychiatry, which allows the doctor to piece together what is
unconsciously disturbing the patient. I succeeded in convincing
the doctor that I was no longer a suicidal risk, and the next day
he personally escorted me to the open ward. I felt completely
evil and bad inside, and was still quite frightened but by what,
I did not definitely know. In fact, at night I would leave the ward
and stand in the hallway looking at the night from the patio, and
all the hairs on my head felt as if they were standing on end.
My feelings of guilt were so intense that I referred to myself as
"the evil one." I had long conversations with myself at night in
this particular section of the hospital. I felt that surely I would
go to hell on dying, and that I had been consigned to a living
death on earth. In fact, I was so convinced of this that I wrote
a letter to my friend, a minister, and tried to explain that perhaps

[p. <i>32</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00030&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Perhaps my thoughts along these lines were colored by reading
the Bible so intensely without the proper religious guidance.


My room was private and overlooked the hospital grounds; it
was directly opposite the base chapel and school. I recall thinking
that I was going out in style. I had a private bath and more
freedom. I now had, in fact the run of the hospital. I could go
downstairs and visit the library and snack bar, get permission to
go outside to see the base movie, and lie down about any time
I wanted. My session with the doctor today was held in the
privacy of my room, as it would be many times in the months
that followed. Looking at the church made me feel very guilty
and intensely unclean, as my feelings of having ruined my family
had not left me yet. I remarked about this to the doctor, and he
replied that there was also a school beside the church, and that
my children, he reassured me, would need the teaching of both
of them. The doctor soon left the room, and I started to get acquainted
with my new environment.


Across the hall was a room with four officers in it. To the
right of my room there was a large ward for enlisted men. The
nurses' station was in the middle of the hallway, with rooms on
either side and rooms with two beds across the hall. Female patients
occupied this section of the ward.


At mealtime food was brought up to the ward, although
most of the patients, including myself, went down to the dining
room. I, being an officer, went to the officers' dining room. I felt
very embarrassed, since the doctors and nurses ate there also.
I was embarrassed because they knew so much of my personal
history. As I already knew, some of the antics of the patients
brought laughter from the nurses and attendants. I felt that I did
not want to be laughed at or talked about when I came in the
dining hall.


Time passed very slowly, as there was nothing really constructive
to do but think. "Think." I seemed to have heard a small
voice within me say, during the acute phase or my illness. "You

[p. <i>33</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00031&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I began to think my hand touched the Book of books, and
I accidentally opened it to a passage in Job. "But there is a spirit
in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding."
So I began the long search for understanding, and it
required long hours of just sitting in one place and not moving,
just thinking. Thus I began the many months of introspection
and reflection that is necessary to find a partial degree of wisdom.
I began by trying to remember the whole of the events of
my life from my earliest memory, and how they affected me then,
and how the situations and my reactions could be affecting me
now. This also was the beginning of my search for God, or the
Infinite. As I read I remembered the dreams that I had had
previously.


My doctors had asked me what I dreamed or hallucinated
about, but for a reason unknown to me I did not tell them. A
year or more would pass before the real significance of some of
the dreams would be unfolded. I would be made painfully aware
of the great truth found in the Bible: "For God speaketh once,
twice yet man perceiveth not. In a dream, in a vision of the night,
when deep sleep falleth upon men. In slumberings upon the
bed. Then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction."
I had begun now to wonder about my dreams and what
they meant. A year later I was to investigate a new science called
parapsychology, and try to correlate the meaning that this infant
science tries to give to dreams in their investigation of extrasensory
phenomena and precognition.


I felt so bad that I just wanted to lie around all day, and certainly
I lacked at this time the one ingredient that all patients

[p. <i>34</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00032&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I decided to see what other men said about this elusive thing
called faith. It is written that "faith is the substance of things
hoped for," but I could only hope to be incarcerated for the
rest of my life. What advantage was there in hoping for that? I
read further in the Book, where the Nazarene carpenter said, "If
ye had faith the size of a grain of mustard seed ye could say to
this mountain, be thou removed and cast into the sea." And
surely men have moved mountains by various and sundry means.


I did not know it at the time, but a seed had been planted
that would cause me to persevere through faith alone, during
the many dark and lonely months ahead.


A knock sounded at the door signaling the arrival of my
mother and dad. I had not seen them for four years, and they
really looked well. The feeling of shame was there, and it seemed
that I felt shame more intensely with those that were closest
to me. Mother had brought me a prayer book, which I put in my
drawer and kept there for several months before I felt I could
pray. Mother and Dad prevailed upon the hospital authorities
to allow me to accompany them for a ride on the grounds of the
base. This was the first time I had been out of the hospital in
five months. I felt better almost immediately, not knowing then
that it was freedom and that alone that made me feel better.


We rode over to the officers' club, which I had looked at for

[p. <i>35</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00033&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I asked my parents to tell me as much about myself as they
could remember. They informed me that I was very aggressive, a
fact that I well knew, and that I was always in a hurry and had
to excel at whatever I tried; and if I thought I could not excel
at something, I would not try. I stored this in my unconscious
mind to reflect on later. They left soon for home, six hundred
miles away. We had had a good visit.


Next week would be Easter Sunday and Mary would be coming.
The doctor gave me permission to spend the week in the
city. Wonderful! I thought. I kept complaining to the doctor
about my lack of memory, and he in turn persistently administered
verbal tests that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that
I had not lost any portion of my memory. I, however, did not
believe this medical evidence, as so many patients do not. We
talked about anatomy and biochemistry, and also about an old
friend of my brother's who had been stationed with him in the
Philippines. He said to me, "Your memory sounds awfully good
to me, Dr. Red; for a fellow whose memory is poor, you sure
remember a hell of a lot." I said that I had probably forgotten all
my dentistry and would not be able to use my hands now. He
pointed out that old techniques were not so easily lost, which I
promptly disregarded.

[p. <i>36</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00034&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mary arrived Friday at noon. I was sitting in the room with
the lights out and the curtains drawn. She immediately opened
the curtains and put the lights on, saying, "I like light." Truly,
she was light that emitted a radiance over all those around her.


We left the hospital and went to her uncle's house and spent
the week end there. I got behind the wheel of the car and drove
to Washington. The streets soon began to be familiar. We drove
past Griffith Stadium and past the street that my dental school
was on; in fact, I could see the top of it. My vision was a bit
hazy, which was due to the medicine I was taking, but in my
depression I attributed it to mental degeneration.


We had dinner with her relatives. After dinner, her aunt remarked
that she felt I was almost well, and also that if I did
not want Mary I should free her. I didn't think very much about
this remark at the time, as my back was hurting and I was trying
to hide the pain from Mary. Her aunt evidently felt that some
domestic difficulty had triggered my illness. The beginning of
interfering relatives. That evening Mary and I sat on the front
steps and talked, and she told me that the children had been in
the hospital for some minor infection but were all right now,
and there was no need for me to feel concerned. She had concealed
it because she did not want me to worry. How right she
was. If I had known the children were in the hospital I would
have blamed myself, and who knows what that might have triggered
with my intense feelings of guilt.


I felt stronger this week end although I felt as though a
weight hung between my shoulder blades pulling me back, a
feeling that caused me to lie down frequently. Tonight my old
school was giving the medical-dental dance, but I did not feel
up to going. We did go to a pre-dance cocktail party, and there
I saw an old friend, many friends, in fact; and although I moved
slowly at this time, I had no feelings of shame.


Soon everyone left the party and we went to a friend's house
to watch television and wait for the party after the dance that
would be held there. We had a grand time talking with old
friends and new ones. At the party Mary wanted to dance, and

[p. <i>37</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00035&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We spent the next day rediscovering one another and went
to see a friend of my wife's who was a Christian Scientist. It
was the first time she had seen Mary since she had been a girl,
and she appeared concerned for my well-being. She told me that
she would begin working for my return to health immediately,
a phrase that I was later to understand as invoking the power
of the supernatural in my behalf through what theologians call
intercessory prayer. I am told it has the power to raise the sick
from their deathbed.


That afternoon Major George Hamp and other friends came
by to see me, and as George was an old and dear friend, I did
not experience the feeling of shame with him as I did with
others. I later came to realize through self-evaluation and introspection
that these feelings of shame were directly related to
the enormous amount of pride that I had. This undue self-esteem
had directly caused the feeling of being ashamed, and consequently
affected my recovery making it operate more slowly
than it otherwise would. I had been ashamed to tell the doctors
my problems; I had been ashamed to admit to myself that I was
really sick; and I had been ashamed to admit that the fault lay
in me. I had looked at things in relationship to me, rather than
viewing them objectively as they really were and are and without
personal thoughts and prejudices. It is this thing called pride
that causes one to be heady and consequently to view things,
especially interpersonal relationships, in a wrong or distorted
manner. In addition, I had discovered that I had an enormous
amount of color prejudice, and I was a Negro myself. This
directly affected my work with the doctors and nurses as a
patient. I might add that while I was thinking these thoughts I
appeared to others to be withdrawn; therefore, uninterested in
those around me or what was going on, I appeared to others to

[p. <i>38</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00036&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That afternoon some friends and I went to the officers' club,
where I was ashamed to go too because the doctors and nurses
frequented the place, and I felt sure that, since they knew all my
business and even my thoughts were not hidden from them, they
gossiped about me. Today, however, there were no officers present
attached to the hospital staff, and I felt enormously relieved.


Major Hamp was recognized by a general officer and called
over and made the following introductions: "General Moore, I
would like to present Dr. Scott, Dr. Peet, Dr. Red, Dr. Funder-backer,
and these are the gals that came with us." The general
laughed because George was somewhat of a comedian, and this
form of introduction was a holdover from college days when we
teased choice "tenders" incessantly, the way fraternity pledgees
were treated, with a lofty air of condescension. We had a few
drinks and reminisced about days long since gone. In fact,
George pointed out that as sophomores in college we had committed
the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám to memory, and although
I still could quote passages of it, I did not understand exactly
what it meant. I made a mental note to reread it and think about
this excellent bit of poetry.


Again I had only remembered the words, and like most intellectuals,
although I remembered the best authors and could
quote them verbatim, I found that I had no true understanding
of what they actually meant to convey. So I was a member of
the select group of people that remembered dates, events, times,
places, faces, authors, books, and could speak intelligently on a
variety of subjects but with little understanding. Therefore it
follows that to perceive wisdom and true instruction one must
go beyond the level of the intellectual, to even grasp small
glimpses of the truth. I decided that I would not want to be an
intellectual. I would rather be a student, one who is seeking
wisdom; and "with thy getting, get understanding."


The conversation during this time was rather light and frivolous,
and I probably gave the impression of being withdrawn to

[p. <i>39</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00037&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That night we went to another party. There were people
there I did not know so well, and I felt very uncomfortable. I
knew most of them knew me by reputation and had heard I
was crazy, and the looks they gave were magnified by me out of
all proportion, for I had not yet reached the point where I
didn't care what people thought.


The next day was Easter Sunday, and I had to return to the
hospital, since this was my first trip out of the hospital and the
authorities did not want me to overdo it. I said good-by to my
wife, and she started on the four-hour return journey home. I
felt a keen sense of depression upon returning to the ward and
my familiar room. I had to take off my civilian clothes and put
hospital pajamas on. In the afternoon, the old feeling of guilt
crept upon me; the sky was overcast with a dull green hue, and
I thought it must have looked like this the day He was crucified.
In my untutored religious interpretation I considered this a
portent of something bad to come, and grandiosely associated
the green overcast with me. I sat at my window and felt terrible
and afraid.


Soon the green overcast of clouds disappeared to be replaced
by a brilliant and wonderful rainbow of many colors. The
church from my window seemed to be sitting exactly in the
middle of the rainbow, and I thought: "He shall set a rainbow
in the heavens as a sign." I also thought that perhaps man will
someday umbrella his cities with some sort of electromagnetic
force very much like the rainbow, to deflect bombs and the
like and also to keep the effect of radiation away from the
population.


The food did not taste good this night at all. It would be two
weeks before I would see Mary again. I sat up all night, reading,

[p. <i>40</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00038&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got out of my bath and resolved to think no more this day.
My final bit of thinking on this subject was that time must have
had a beginning, but no ending. It was all so confusing that my
head began to ache. 1 fell asleep and promptly had a nightmare
that I could not remember upon waking.


In the afternoon I saw my doctor, and he asked me how the
week end had gone and if I felt all right. I assured him that I
did, and told him that I felt more comfortable outside than
inside the hospital. He replied that hospitals were depressing
places and far from a normal part of things. I tried to point
out that I felt mostly uncomfortable with the white personnel,
as I was the only colored officer on the ward and I really
had no one to talk to. Since the nurses and attendants wrote
down every word you said in order to report it to the doctor, I
naturally felt that I did not have anyone to talk to in confidence.

[p. <i>41</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00039&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I especially did not want the white patients to know my
business, since basically we lived in two different worlds, and
the white world is a universe apart from that of the Negro,
especially since Negro officers have to live like Negroes and
think like white men. I had been told so often by other white
officers that they did not consider me a Negro, but rather
as one of them, which indicated they themselves, being liberals,
were guilty of usually lumping all Negroes together as a group.
They were not quite up to par socially and especially mentally.
It makes for a terrible burden for one lone Negro to carry
the burden of 20,000,000 blacks on his shoulders, since he is
received not essentially as a man but as a Negro man; a human
being, but different from the rest of the white world; so different,
in fact, that he is denied his equal rights on every level in
American society—schools, housing, jobs, even advancement to
higher rank in the services, because of the prejudice of those in
authority.


Dr. Bill answered that being Jewish he understood these
things and knew of them firsthand. But his battles against prejudice
had been fought solely on religious grounds, and white
Protestants do not teach their children that Jews are dumb,
dirty, offensive, and sexually more robust than the gentile is;
rather, they teach that the Jew is shrewd, cunning, mostly given
to taking advantage in business and the like—a teaching based
more on envy than contempt, as the comparison to the Negro is
made. The white man forgets when he meets an uneducated
Negro that this person, in some states, could have been legally
deprived of the means for an education, and yet his defense is
that the majority of blacks are ignorant. He declares to high
heaven that Negroes live in humble homes without the resulting
upkeep necessary to keep property in topnotch shape. Here

[p. <i>42</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00040&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Curiously, men, black or white, do not have this undercurrent
of feeling usually; only predominantly in situations where the
black man is thrown in contact with the white woman. When men
are gathered together, there does not seem to be a feeling of
tension. Does the American white man actually believe in the
myth of the purity and virginal honor of the white woman?
He evidently does, for it is pointed out vividly by the signs in
southern restrooms and the like: "White Ladies" and "Colored
Women." And again, if Negroes are such beasts, why has the
white man made such a practice of romping in beds and cornfields
with so many Negro maids? Did not diseases of sexual
origin have their beginning with the white man who went to the
so-called savage countries to lift up these poor backward people
from centuries of uncivilized living? Did not the American
Negro soldier in Korea prove stronger percentage-wise with
fewer going over to the enemies' camp? And did he not know
that the Chinese Communist felt instinctively superior to men of
black skin? It is a combination of these things that has divided
the American Negro successfully by the white man. After the
centuries of harsh treatment and mental cruelty visited on him,

[p. <i>43</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00041&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My doctor asked, "Don't you think things are getting
better?" They are getting better, but much too slowly. The
country is losing fine brains because educational opportunities
are denied. More are getting sick because of the self-loathing that
cannot be adequately transferred. And what is so tragic about it
is that many thousands of Negroes believe the brain-washing
of inferior status that is forced on the Negro by television,
schools, homes, churches, and so on. He too often believes
that he will not get the chance to shine, so he doesn't prepare
himself for the opportunity that all too often does not come.


I had in fact realized how color conscious I really was by
understanding that all my girl friends before marriage had been
of the fair or mulatto variety, what white men had for centuries
known to be the chosen variety, and even preferred by them to
their own white women of pure virtue in the South. I had subconsciously
picked up the idea in my youth that if you had to be
a Negro, be a light-skinned one. I had been subtly brain-washed
as most of my contemporaries had, by the idea that black is
wrong and white is right, and that it is better to be half right
than all wrong. I was full of prejudice myself and began to understand
that most people just believe what they hear without any
thought or investigation of their own.


It really showed monumental ignorance on the part of the
white man to spread the rumor that Negroes had tails, as they
(white men) did during the Second World War. And even more
degrading was the fact that large numbers of whites believed
these lies. Any kind of book on sociology would inform the
most ignorant of the great races of mankind. The session ended
with Dr. Bill informing me that I was awfully prejudiced against
whites.


By now the doctors thought I was coming along fine, and

[p. <i>44</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00042&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The calm was shattered by the scream of some woman's voice.
I looked out the door and saw a woman patient running down
the hall, holding her head. I closed the door and my friend and
I talked until he was required to go back to his ward downstairs.


Once or twice a week the psychiatric staff would get together
on the softball field with the patients, who would play and get
plenty of exercise. I never played because I never felt like
running after balls. I was still weak and lying around was not
helping to increase my strength. It was not that I was so weak; it
was that I thought I was weak. I had excellent power of suggestion,
but I was using it negatively.


By this time I had been taken off the more powerful
tranquilizers in high dosage and put on a mild tranquilizer of
small dosage. I had begun to feel better, but with little strength
and absolutely no faith. I also had the privilege of going to the
base theater at night, which was not too far to walk. I enjoyed
the movies both on the ward and off, due to the escape-from-reality
value in them. While watching a movie, one did not tire
oneself out thinking or remembering. You could safely live in
the make-believe world of the cinema. You could be strong or
weak, cowardly or brave, a knave or a hero, as the mood struck
you. Every evening about eight o'clock, coffee and pastry were
brought to the ward from the kitchen, and the patients truly
enjoyed this.


The next morning after breakfast I went into the Day Room

[p. <i>45</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00043&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After lunch I went riding with one of the nurses. We rode
around the base, and talked. We went to the base exchange
store where I bought a toy each for Freddie and Sharon—a
rag doll for Sharon and a cash register for Freddie. We came
back to the ward and a corpsman and I wrapped the packages,
and I mailed them in the hospital post office.


By this time the Air Force had begun to send me my own
money to handle. During the acute phase of my illness, Mary
was made my trustee and handled all my funds. Officers are
required to pay a very small sum for their food, something like a
dollar a day. So the Air Force paid me and I would pay the
hospital paymaster at the end of the month for the very good
food I enjoyed.


My doctor had told my parents and my wife that he expected
it would take me about one year to recover and return to work.
So they all knew that I did not dare to believe that I would
eventually recover. I was still in the I-don't-care stage, and
getting out of the hospital was not important. In fact, getting
back to work did not seem important at all. I was only marking
time, waiting, for what, I did not know.

[p. <i>46</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00044&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During the visiting hour this evening, I had a very pretty
visitor. A friend of a dental colleague was in Washington
from New York, and he had instructed her to call on me. She
brought me a beautiful scarf, and we chatted about all the people
we knew. She wanted to know about my friends, whom she had
heard of but had never met. She had a sister who was stationed
on the base, and after this visit her sister visited me regularly
and brought me fruit.


During the month of May, I studied the religious thoughts
that have been passed down through the ages in the Christian
faith, and tried to think on these things. I had been warned by
Dr. Bill that if I were going to study these religious thoughts I
should do it under the supervision of the hospital chaplain,
who came on the wards every day to offer spiritual help to those
who wanted it.


As usual, I did not follow my doctor's orders, and I am sure
I misinterpreted many of the passages. However, one particular
passage stuck with me. It was: "God shall not put on you
more than you can bear." I was in physical pain and mental
anguish, but evidently I was bearing it. Somehow I had been
given the strength to endure, and I had not had thoughts of
suicide for many months now. Although I did not know or
realize it myself, this showed remarkable improvement. So I
was able to bear it.


Mother and Dad came up from North Carolina on the first of
the month, and I asked my doctor where could they stay, and he
suggested getting in touch with base housing or a motel not far
from the hospital that accepted Negroes. This indicated how
much I had begun to rely on my doctor for doing my thinking for
me. I had spent four years in Washington and knew it like the
back of my hand, and yet I was asking Dr. Bill to help me find a
place for my parents to stay. When they arrived, we left the
hospital after they talked with my doctor, and we went to my
former landlady's house, where I had spent four years as a
student. We all called her "Mom" because that's what she truly
was—a mother to the boys who stayed with her during the four

[p. <i>47</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00045&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We were greeted very cordially, and it was truly like
being home again. We ate dinner and watched television. I did
not feel like going out, so we sat and talked of the past and the
fun we had as students and of Europe while I was stationed
there. Mother had come to Europe while I was there and had
spent three months, traveling and taking pictures. My cousin,
who is an M.D., came by with his wife to see me, and told me
that I looked depressed. I didn't feel depressed, although I gave
the impression of looking absolutely limp from the drugs that
I was required to take. He was doing his internship at my old
hospital, and I did not talk with him concerning my condition
because he had no training in psychiatry. His wife, Marjorie,
told me that I had been very nervous during the wedding, when
I had got married four years before.


We ate dinner and went to visit one of Dad's old friends who
had grown up with him in Virginia. The Prices thought I
looked well and since Mary was anxious to move to Washington
to be near me, I asked them to be on the lookout for a house for
us. After the visit, we went back to my landlady's house and I
went to bed, but could not sleep.


I stood up and saw the old Howard University clock in the
distance. It reminded me of Big Ben in London. I had been
rather preoccupied by time, for the last few weeks. Time was
something that bothered me, although I could not put my finger
on just what it was about time that disturbed me. I had been
in a hurry all my life, as though I was in a race. Everything was

[p. <i>48</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00046&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I awoke early next morning to the howling of a dog somewhere
in the alley. Someone is about to die or is dead; the old
southern superstitious thought came back. For the past months
I had not slept well, and when I did sleep I awakened early
with the birds, and consequently stayed in a perpetual state of
exhaustion. Today we planned to visit some old friends, and
still I did not feel like getting around. I went, out of deference
to my parents. Today I felt very nervous and began pacing up
and down as soon as I got up. People seeing me like this
immediately felt confirmed in their belief that I was indeed
sick. I did not understand the necessity to pace, which I did
from time to time. I later found out that the drugs could cause
this reaction also. I felt a necessity to lie down a lot, as though
there was a weight on my shoulders pulling me backward and
down. My back had stopped hurting at this time, and I had no
headaches to speak of now. Dad's car went on the blink during
the trip, this time, and we went to the shop to get it fixed.
I paid for it, since Dad had very little money. As usual, Dad,
being a very humble man, was very grateful.


Dad told me that Mary had come to visit them, to let them
get a first look at Sharon. Mother had seen Freddie when he was
about a year old, in England. The children were well, and Dad
was pleased with how Mary appeared to be bearing up under

[p. <i>49</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00047&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I have related earlier how much stronger I felt when I was
out of the hospital on week-end visits home. This was acutely
pointed out this time when I returned to the hospital after Dad
and Mother left for North Carolina. It seemed that a weight
settled over me when I returned to the incarcerated world of
the ward. I felt as if a truck was sitting squarely on top of my
head. The immediate sense of depression returned overwhelmingly,
so on my return to the hospital this Sunday afternoon, I
felt that I could relieve this uncomfortable feeling by concentrating
on something else. I began to read and concentrate on
the Holy Scriptures.


During this part of my stay in the hospital, my time, when
I was not with my doctor or eating, was spent in meditation.
By this I mean sitting in a chair hardly moving, and thinking,
turning my thoughts inward as well as my mind's eye to inner
things. It was during a period of meditation like this that a
strange thing occurred, strange in that it was not accountable
then, and months of research since then have not been able to
explain the phenomena, which I shall relate.


I was sitting and thinking so hard that my head had begun
to hurt. I had been reading passages in the Scripture that
sought to acquaint man with the existence of a material part of
his being that men have referred to as soul, spirit, inner self,
and so on, when I felt a strange and inexplicable change. I felt
as though my eyes were a camera looking into the very depths
of my inner being. Instead of seeing things in front of me, I
seemed to be seeing the inside of my cranial cavity, and I saw
in the approximate position of the center of my head something
that looked like the letter "I," and to its superior most portion
three lines diverged outwardly from the superior portion
of the "I" to form a triangle at the base. The color of the
lines were red. This image lasted roughly thirty seconds.


Visual hallucinations are of two types—one, positive, where
you see things outside of the body that are not there; and two,

[p. <i>50</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00048&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Now this was a very frightening and revealing episode, as
with the occurrence of this phenomena I felt for the first time in
my illness a serenity I had never experienced before or since.


Man has long wrestled with the problem of the so-called immortal
part of man, his soul, spirit, or the "I" that lies somewhere
in man, perhaps in his brain where there does seem to be a
connection of this imperishable substance to that of the higher
and lower natures of men. Could it be possible that some few
men in the annals of recorded history, through profound introspection
and reflection, could have literally seen this "I" or soul?
We have the Nazarene's reassurance that all things are possible,
and if man has moved mountains then why not one or some who
have sufficiently introspected themselves to the point where
they have caught a glimpse of the great "I AM."


Since that experience my research led me to the thoughts of
men who referred to the "I" in man. In Exodus, Moses writes
that God said unto him, "I AM THAT I AM," and told him to

[p. <i>51</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00049&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I resolved to find out as much as I could about what has
been written about the soul, and this led me to Descartes,
Kant, religious theses, and other philosophers. These books,
however, were not in the hospital library, so this search had to
wait for some months. Later that night I went out on the hospital
grounds and looked toward the great cosmic universe that man
has often called the heavens, and felt so truly small. I counted
the stars till I became lost in figures and in the vastness of this
great endless thing called space. Each star is a sun like our own,
and there are multitudinous galaxies beyond our own. Why
then, it was true, earth was but a grain of sand along the
ocean of the universe. "What then is man that thou shouldst be
mindful of him?" Indeed where was he when the foundations
of this cosmic wonder was called into being? How was all this
panorama of stars, planets, asteroids, and so on, held in its
relative position? By electrical energy, of course. Then it therefore
follows that the infinite works through man as his instrument
of breathing reality.


Now if man is a part of the infinite that has as its very roots
a never-ending creative force, then that part of man coming from,
and intimately related to, the infinite never dies because it
cannot, since it has no organs necessary for physical life. Then
this thing must be man's soul, and therefore it must be released
after physical death. Therefore, what is the only known force
that can transcend time, space, and cannot be contained?


Electrical energy? Why, then, could it not be that this is the
small part of the infinite that resides in us, and that goes back
to the cosmos after death and is reused in the creative forces at
work in the heavens? How wise were the Holy men who
prophesied that man's body would go back to dust and the
soul back to God who gave it.

[p. <i>52</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00050&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In the language of the poets as well as in the discourse of
philosophers, body and soul are correlative terms. The words are
used together in daily speech. Men who are unaware of,
or deny, the metaphysical and theological significance of having
a soul, nevertheless use the word "soul" with a sense of contrast
to body, even if only to refer to vague manifestations of spiritfeelings
and sympathies which seem to be alien to the world of
matter. With few exceptions, traditional theories of the soul
involve its distinction from and relation to the body. Berkeley
represents only the major exception. Denying the reality of
matter, he conceives the soul as existing in and by itself; souls
or spirits differ from God as finite from infinite spiritual beings.
That something which knows and perceives "and which exercises
divers operations, as willing, imagining, remembering," Berkeley
says, "is what I call mind, spirit, soul, or myself." He therefore
would not speak of men as having souls, but rather as being
souls.


The other major exception is exemplified by Lucretius. It is
not that Lucretius denies soul as Berkeley denies body. Nor
does he deny that soul adds something to the body that differentiates
living organisms from inorganic things. On the contrary,
he declares the mind to be a "part of man no whit less than
hand and foot and eyes are parts of the whole living being.
Distinct from mind, soul is also part of a living being. Mind and
soul are held in union one within the other and form of themselves
nature, but whereas the mind is the lord or head of the
whole body, the rest of the soul, spread throughout the body,
obeys and is moved at the will and inclination of the mind."


Apart from these exceptions, the traditional discussion of
soul considers it as somehow cojoined with body to constitute a
whole of which it is the immaterial principle part. Even those
who, like Descartes, define the soul as an immaterial substance,
capable of existing by itself, do not actually ascribe to the human
soul complete independence of the human body. Nevertheless
the many sided controversy indicates the traditional connection
of soul with life and mind, on the one hand, and with animate or

[p. <i>53</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00051&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If the individual soul ceases to be when the body with which
it is somehow united perishes, it is as mortal as the body.
The traditional theories of personal immortality, such as the
Platonic myths concerning the transmigration or reincarnation of
souls and the Christian doctrine of men's immortal soul,
specially created for union with body but destined to survive its
separation from the body, are theories that involve conceptions
of the soul as capable of self-subsistence. Here we see how different
implications of immortality necessarily follow from various
theories of the soul.


In the opening pages of his treatise <i>On the Soul</i>, Aristotle says
that "to attain any assured knowledge about the soul is one
of the most difficult things in the world. The difficulty seems
to apply both to what the soul is and to whether it exists. Even
Lucretius, who regards the soul as material in nature, does not
claim to know its existence by direct observation. It is not like
the body itself or like other parts of the body, a sensible
object. It must be inferred to exist, just as unobservable atoms
are inferred in order to explain the constitution and change of
all material objects; so the existence of soul is inferred to explain
the constitution and motion of living things. Those who conceive
of the soul as immaterial would seem to face an even
greater difficulty in establishing its existence and describing its
nature. These philosophers feel that the soul is some sort of immaterial
being that cannot be discovered by observation and
experiment. I believe that men like Moses, Christ, Omar Khayyam
saw the "I" as the form the soul takes. I have had a similar
experience. Not all ministers agree with Aristotle that the soul
is an object difficult to know, or with Kant that it is absolutely
impossible for us to reach any sound theoretical conclusion about
the soul's existence. Descartes, for example, says that if there are
"any persons who are not sufficiently persuaded of the existence
of God and of the soul by the reasons which I have brought
forward, I wish them to know that all other things of which they

[p. <i>54</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00052&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

For both Descartes and Berkeley, the immortality of the soul
can be directly concluded from our knowledge of the soul's existence
and nature. "The soul," writes Berkeley, "is indivisible,
incorporeal, and is incorruptible. Nothing can be plainer than the
motions, changes, decays and dissolutions which we hourly see
befall material bodies cannot affect an active, simple, uncompounded
substance; such a being therefore is indissolvable by
the force of nature; that is to say the soul of man is naturally
immortal."


"The existence and immortality of the soul" is, for Kant, a
postulate or demand of the practical reason. Of the psychic
substance, regarded as an immortal soul, it is absolutely impossible
to obtain any proof from a theoretical point of view.
It then becomes a matter of faith."


In the "Phedo," for example, Socrates asks, "What is that the
inheritance of which will render the body alive?" To which
Cebes answers, "Soul," and he agrees with Socrates' further statement
that whatever the soul takes possession of, to that she comes
bearing life. To this much Aristotle also agrees. "What has soul
in it," he says, "differs from what has not, in that the former
displays life."

After this night, I was no longer afraid, and resolved to lose
the awful pride that man stumbles upon and falls under like a
rolling stone that crushes flowers in its path. I slept soundly
for the first time in two years.


The next morning, I awakened refreshed, still feeling good

[p. <i>55</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00053&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It would indeed sound strange to say that homo sapiens is
related to the algae of the sea, but these same atoms and
chemicals can be demonstrated in both, only in different molecular
arrangements, even to inanimate things. The words of
Omar Khayyám, "Pray then, who is the potter and who the
pot?" have more significance from this point of view. How much
nearer, then, is man related to his brothers of different races?


In today's session with Dr. Bill I did not relate the events
of the past night, as I did not wish him to think I was completely
crocked, so instead we talked of the soul. He felt that
man indeed had a soul and that it was what one loved with. He
used the biblical "Song of Solomon" as a reference point. "By
night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth." If one
loves with the soul, then is it not correct to say that one also
feels the lesser emotions with the same soul? Hate, fear, rage,
disgust, contempt, each being in its turn a product of the soul,
and the emotions other than love, if felt in abnormal quantities,
could be the product of a diseased soul. Surely, then, men would
have to grope deeper than some physical area in the brain to
control their emotions that, when not in harmony, cause all
sorts of human maladies, from minor emotional illnesses to
major mayhem.


The relationship of the emotions and, to some extent, temperament
and character to the endocrines has been a fruitful
source of speculation. Here it is difficult to say which is the cart,

[p. <i>56</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00054&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Summing up, a vast amount of experimental evidence has
accumulated to show the influence of the secretions of the ductless
glands on the body functions and their relation to the
cerebrospinal and vegetative nervous systems. Much of the
knowledge is still speculative, and the manifold clinical syndromes
are yet incapable of definite correlation. With some
notable exceptions, there is considerable ignorance in the domain
of therapeutics, and much that passes for scientific, clinical endocrinology
is either sheer naïveté, or actually represents an
attempt to delude oneself and others. We must still look forward
to the information furnished by accurate experimentation before
we can apply it to clinical neurology.

Sanders Co., 1958), pp. 627-28.</div>
Presently, work is being
done at U.C.L.A. in the brain center, investigating the hypothalamus
as the emotional center.


After this discussion, Dr. Bill informed me that I was well
enough to return to work, beginning in the dental clinic and
laboratory, then the transition from this to actual resumption of
practice on patients. It would take him approximately one week
to set the necessary machinery into motion by seeing the dental
surgeon and explaining the situation to him. I was to find out
that the whole hospital goes all-out for the rehabilitation of the
mentally ill patients. Men who were personnel workers were
put to work in the administrative offices. Nurses and doctors
were placed under the supervision of other similarly trained personnel

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00055&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

This next week would be my last week of concentrated meditation.
Dr. Bill had made all arrangements with the dental
surgeon to allow me to work first in the hospital dental clinic,
and from there to the large base dental clinic. During this final
week of meditation, in trying to understand a few of the basic
reasons for man's existence, I discovered that I had a photographic
memory. I thought and remembered in pictures. I saw
the mental picture of life as a circle with no beginning and no
ending, and that I and those about me were a part of a never
ending source that fed this circle. We live, we produce, we die,
we live again in another form, perhaps performing some other
vital work in the universe than can truly be said to be the handiwork
of some creative force. I concluded that this force was the
infinite, or, as Christians call it, God, the Buddhists, Buddha, the
Moslems Allah, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Therefore it appeared that all men
seek to find the infinite sooner or later, and they take different
roads and cry out in different tongues, seeking the same thing
and giving it a multitude of names. I might add that during this
period of meditation I had stopped going to the dining hall
downstairs, an action I was to regret later, due to the over-all
reflection of my progress report.


This Friday, my love, loyal and true, came to see me. She
stood tall and willowy, like the pine tree by the rippling brook,
with more grace than the growing sapling and smelling of the
beauty of the outdoors. Mary had bounced into the ward with
an electric charge that embraced everyone with her presence. My
heart sang with happiness. I was beginning to see a way out of
this jungle of concrete and screened windows. She was as graceful
as the gazelle and more beautiful than the Mona Lisa. (Get
her done in oil one day, old boy, I thought). Every time she
came on the ward the nurses and attendants had a special hello
for her, and the men had that special look reserved for all
thoroughbred animals. Indeed, she was a thoroughbred (having
attended Fryburg Academy in Maine, and Colby College in the

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00056&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I signed out at the nurses' station, and we left the hospital
and went to the officers' club to eat. Here, as in Europe, she
commanded attention. People turned around to look at her regal
elegance. She was indeed a magnet that attracted all living
things around her. Even animals would come to her with tails
wagging. We saw an old friend of ours whom we had been
stationed with in Europe, and had an enjoyable afternoon.


We went to Mom's, and as soon as we were in the house we
were committed to each other's strong sexual needs. It had
always felt as if it was the very first time we had made love
to one another. Love between us was still raging and consuming,
and we were well mated. I thought of the old Greek myth that
tells of how long ago man and woman were connected into
one body, and the race was very happy till Zeus's observing pride
and arrogance split them asunder with his bolts of lightning;
and from that time to this, man and woman have spent a considerable
part of their lives looking for the other half of themselves.
Truly, I was fortunate. I had my other half and life
was pleasant again. Some unfortunates go through life without
ever discovering the joy of being a whole person, as we truly
are with our mates. She looked at me and said, "All you need is
tender, loving care," and my heart leaped. I was fifteen feet tall.
That night we went to see her brother, who was passing through
Washington and staying at a white friend's home, a boy he
attended school with. John, Jr., Mary's brother, looked Mexican
(certainly not many Negroid characteristics, with black, straight
hair, and a thin face and mouth). His schoolmates called him
Carlos. I looked at the rather cold reception he gave her, and
her lack of warmth in greeting him, and felt that he was a carbon
copy of his father, a white-black man, stiff, formal, cold, with
hard, piercing eyes. Mary was like her mother, I thought—
soft, gentle, sweet, and warm.

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00057&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The members of the family of John's friend were all there,
including the grandmother, who kept her earphone in my face
all night, asking me questions. Mary immediately established
rapport with them, as they interrogated her about the schools
she attended and mentally approved of her schools, if not her
racial origin. I thought: What middle-class snobs! And I immediately
felt superior to them. Their feigned friendliness was
obvious, and it occurred to me that the black and white middleclass
was just alike. Climbers, socially and intellectually, living
in neighborhoods they could not afford and sending their children
to preparatory schools that they equally could not afford—
status seekers. All is vanity, and vanity is an evil disease.


We soon were ready to leave, after listening to the wife's long
harangue on military-service protocol at social functions. It was
raining. Mary started out the door, and the wife suggested I
bring the car up to the door to keep Mary from getting wet.
Now Mary's favorite pastime is walking in the rain, and since
she had an umbrella, it was "no sweat" walking to the car. Mary
joined in the request, so she wouldn't appear to have an uncultured
husband, I suppose. It made me angry.


We drove through the rain to the Kenyon Grill, a restaurant
and bar on Georgia Avenue, just around the corner from my
landlady's home. We had pizza and beer and listened to Italian
music.


We reminisced about the three weeks we spent in Italy
in 1957. We relived the experience from Milan north to Venice.
From Venice to the Isle of Capri, and south along the Riviera
to Genoa, the birthplace of Columbus. She was especially fond
of Capri and Florence. My greatest treasures of the trip was the
Eternal City, Rome, especially Vatican City.


We were visiting St. Peter's in Rome, and stood in the world's
most beautiful sanctuary drinking in the beauty of the Sistine
Chapel, and the works of art done by Michelangelo, Da Vinci,
and the others whose great creative minds gave the world so
much to reflect on. While standing in front of the altar, I had an
overpowering urge to walk to the rear of it, down a corridor,

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00058&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I do not know what to attribute this to. Perhaps some inner
force was guiding me to some form of spiritual acquaintance
even at that time. For in retrospect I was sick then with premonitions
of death, which were later confirmed by my attempts
at suicide. We went home and spent the night in each other's
arms, and the phrase from "Song of Solomon" burst from my
lips, "Behold, thou art fair my love; behold, thou art fair."


Saturday we looked for a house. We could not find an available
apartment. We did, however, look at a house that would
supposedly be vacant in two months in front of Mary's aunt's
home. With not very much luck today, we resolved that I should
continue looking after Mary went back home. That afternoon
some of the old gang met at the Kenyon Grill. The girls were all
young matrons now, except for one girl still in college, with
my friend Sam Peet. We drank beer, and Ann Home, trying to
console me, informed me that her father, who was a physician,
had had a nervous breakdown and spent a year in a veterans'
hospital. Later in the afternoon, the group went with us to Bolling
Field Base for dinner, and we stayed on later for the dancing.
That night at Mom's, Mary said that perhaps she could make
two upstairs rooms at Mom's livable for the four of us, so the
family could be together again. I didn't think much of the idea,
as she would have to share the kitchen with Mom, and the two
rooms were very small.


The next day we visited her relatives and some more friends
of ours, and friends of the Smiths came by and we spent the
rest of my time that week end drinking coffee and tea. Soon it
was two o'clock, and we left. Mary had a four-hour drive back
to Virginia, and neither of us wanted her to travel at night.


At this time, I was beginning to hate the thought of returning
to the hospital. Each time I returned it was difficult getting
adjusted again. She dropped me off at the officers' club and

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00059&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Monday morning I awakened with a great deal of anticipation
and excitement, and full of nervous energy. After eating
breakfast, time passed very slowly until ten o'clock. That was the
appointed hour to start my day in the dental clinic. I went down
four stories to the ground floor, and then down a flight of stairs
to where the aerospace medicine and dental clinies were combined.
I introduced myself to the officer in charge, First Lieutenant
Harold Stein. He said that he had been expecting me,
and since I outranked him he felt there was very little supervision
he could give me. I replied that I had been out of harness
for a long time and may have forgotten a few things, and that
I was nervous. I was in fact so nervous that I frequently made
trips to the bathroom to urinate. He wanted me to familiarize
myself with procedural methods first, and then I could get down
to the business of examining patients and making dental
diagnoses.


Nothing but the completion of examining forms and emergency
treatment were carried out in this part of the dental clinic.
So there was very little pressure brought to bear on me, and
the work was done at a leisurely pace, with frequent coffee
breaks. My hours of work were to be from ten to twelve at first,
gradually working up to a full day as my strength returned.


I spent the two hours that morning going through instrument
cabinets and familiarizing myself with instruments and records.
This was not dentistry as I liked it, but it was a start. Lunchtime
came sooner than I expected, and I ate lunch in the snack bar

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00060&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I went to the library after lunch, and read. I had been spending
a lot of my time there, and today I was a student of the
immortal Shakespeare. I had never understood the Shakespearean
plays that I had seen in college, and had not, I knew
now, because I was unfamiliar with the stories he told. So I
began reading them with new interest.


Later in the afternoon I saw my doctor, and he asked me how
the week end had gone. I replied, "Fine, I just hated to come
back to the hospital, and having to come back upset me." He
reassured me that it was a normal feeling, and that hospitals
were depressing places, and that I was doing well. I did not
know, and he never thought to ask me, although I am sure he
must have wondered, why I never asked for sick leave to go
home. In retrospect I know that if I had taken sick leave for
a month, the ensuing problems and heartbreak later on would
not have occurred. I just did not realize that a psychiatric
patient would be allowed to leave the hospital for a month.


Since beginning the week-end leaves from the hospital, I had
begun to improve immensely, but on coming back to the ward
I entered in a slump that lasted until my next time out of the
hospital. If I had gone home for a month, I would have felt
better, being around those I loved and who loved me. As I was
in a kind of hostile environment (one that was all white, with
no friends to talk to), I felt more uncomfortable than I ordinarily
would have been. We talked of the times in England when
in an all-white environment of less than normal social acceptance,

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00061&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Going back to the ward, I lapsed into negative hallucinations
and daydreaming while watching television. This daydreaming
had begun as a habit to escape the reality of locked doors and a
very unpleasant environment. Like all habits, it had been easy to
form, but very difficult to break; one had to daydream in order
to escape from the confines of a concrete prison and barred
windows. In fact, just about everything one does during one's
waking hours in a mental institution is a form of escape into
unreality in order to make reality possible. I soon tired of this,
however, and went over to the closed ward to talk with a Negro
nurse I had become friendly with while I was under her
supervision.


She introduced me to the new patients, and one in particular
I shall never forget because of his courage and perserverance.
His name was Airman Jones. He had been struck by the loose
end of an electric wire and absorbed a heavy electrical charge
—in fact, almost killed. He was blind and could not walk, and
lay there unable to talk well at all. There was a record player
in his room for him to enjoy—some sort of entertainment. He
was swathed in a diaper as he could not control his bodily
functions. There was a burned area of about five millimeters
in circumference near the occiput, and I was told that this was
where the electrical current emerged from his body. He showed
amazing fortitude, and during the following months as I visited
him I was to witness a miraculous recovery.


I was there the day he regained his sight, when he happily
exclaimed, "I can see! I can see!" From this point, his vision
returned, and he learned to walk through a remarkable program
of physical therapy. I watched his progress from the wheel chair

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00062&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By this time I had become accustomed to the screams of
the patients in the locked rooms and to those lying on the floor.
I played without thinking of them at all. The lights were turned
out at ten o'clock, and since I could not sleep well I visited the
nurses' station, and talked. I felt rather discouraged, since I had
been told I was being retired from the Air Force, that I loved
so well. I felt kind of useless, and the charge nurse, trying to
bolster my flagging spirits, suggested that I had much to give,
meaning dentistry, and that people Liked me. She assured me
that I would do well when I returned to civilian practice. I remained
unconvinced, however, and felt that I would be incarcerated
forever. I was sleepy now, so I went to bed.


My first patient for periodic examination, next morning, was
Major Jane Port. She was the charge nurse on the psychiatric
wards, and she seemed surprised that I was going to examine
her. However, she put me immediately at ease and sat in the
chair, and I very carefully made an expert examination. I have
not forgotten my dentistry, I thought.


This week passed very rapidly, since for the first time in
more than six months I was engaged in some meaningful
activity. I had lots of visitors this week. Dr. Funderbacker, who
was doing his residency in surgery, and Dr. Peet, also a surgery
resident, came to see me bearing gifts of beautiful girls. Six of
them, to be precise. Bill said he felt I needed cheering up, so
he brought some "young tenders" for a visit. Some of the male
patients, as they passed the visiting room, were heard to say,
"My goodness, what pretty women!"


Summer was here now, and my work in the clinic was pleasant.
I had even seen some emergency dental patients who were

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00063&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After lunch today my lifelong friend, the Reverend Fredrick
Hester, on visit from California, came to see me. We spent the
afternoon talking and reminiscing. I was reminded of what he
had told me some years earlier when we were boys in college.
I had always had the habit of joking a lot, and even my serious
moods were punctuated by being funny. It was during an episode
of this type that he pointedly told me to say what I meant
and to mean what I say. When I thought of this I remembered
that perhaps I had said things to my doctors that I had not
truly meant to convey, and perhaps they had received the wrong
impression. Since I convey my thoughts much better on paper
than verbally, I am sure I had made drastic mistakes with my
tongue.


We were in the library, and Fred wanted to pray. I felt
very ashamed as we prayed. I looked around the room, and
there were two nurses and a few patients looking at us. I do
not know why I felt so acutely ashamed, but I did. I might add
here that while I had studied the Holy Scriptures seriously
during the last six months, I had gone to church only twice,
since I had been hospitalized.


For the past few months I had toyed with the idea of
becoming a Catholic. I had been reared in the Methodist Church,
and therefore I had the common prejudices and misbeliefs
through ignorance that most persons outside the Catholic Church
had toward that religious group. It was not until I seriously
studied the world's great religions that my prejudices began to
crumble. The one good thing that the Catholic Church has that
no other Christian church practices is the confessional. This
shows the wisdom of the founding fathers of this subdivision
of Christianity. Men, they realized, needed to bare their innermost
selves from time to time to someone they trusted, in order
to find relief. So was born the confession, heard by a priest.


The Catholic Church then has been practicing a religious
form of psychotherapy for centuries, and a priest plays the role

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00064&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My friend bade me good-by after spending the whole afternoon
with me, and I stayed in the library deliberately avoiding
contact with the ward as much as possible. It had now become
an ordeal to go back to the ward each time I left it. I had also
taken to the habit of going to the base movie every night, even
seeing the same picture over again to stay away from the confines
of the fourth floor. It was the middle of June now, and summer
in Washington is very oppressive and humid. Although the
hospital was air conditioned, it was uncomfortable inside as well.


That week I called base housing and requested living accommodations
for a family of four. There was none. I called friends
and enlisted their aid in finding a house or an apartment. By
the time Mary arrived, after the usual two weeks' absence, we
had two apartments to look at. She arrived this time with
Freddie, our firstborn. She had brought him up to be examined
by a military cardiologist at the famed Walter Reed Army Hospital.
She had taken care of this that morning, and by noon
had arrived to sign me out of the hospital.


When she came, I was at work in the dental clinic. She and
the boy came in, and she took one look at me and said she was
proud of me. Freddie looked at me with a smattering of recognition
and said hello to me. He called me Jinx, and ten minutes
later we were fast friends again. While we three were driving
the fifteen miles back to Washington, I looked down at my arm
at the fiercely ugly diagonal scar, and Mary wanted to know if
it embarrassed me. The scar itself didn't, but the knowledge
that she knew how it got there did.

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00065&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was a hot day, and Freddie was sitting on his mommy's
lap and perspiring on her dress. She lifted him up and raised
her dress for him to sit on her bare legs, and I momentarily
got a flash of well-proportioned thigh that so disturbed me
emotionally that the old sexual need crept upon me immediately.
Instead of going to Mom's this week end we went to her cousin's
house and spent the week end there. I spent the rest of the day
getting reacquainted with Freddie, and playing with him. In
six months he had become quite tall for a four-year-old boy.
The Army doctors who had examined him that morning said
he had a heart murmur. They felt it was nothing to worry about,
as most children have murmurs of one type or another, and all
we had to do was check him every six months or so. But worry
I did, and felt that I was somehow to blame for his condition.


I was indeed a confirmed pessimist, and loaded with guilt I
was not at all optimistic as my wife was. While the boy and I
played together, a friend of the family came to see me, and on
glimpsing our Freddie remarked that the boy looked so much
like me that I could have "spit him out." He did indeed look
very much like me, and her further remark was that as long
as my son lived I would never die. I reflected upon this for a
moment, and realized that we do indeed approach, to a degree,
immortality through our chilren. No matter what happens to me,
through him I would live, and this is a form of the immortal.


I soon began to feel a weight on my back and head, and
it seemed about to topple me over. I felt as though two trucks
loaded with cement were on top of my head. I went upstairs to
rest while the girls stayed downstairs and indulged in that kind
of talk so important to women—children, the home, clothes,
and so on. Before going to sleep I noticed an old certificate near
the window. I went over to examine it, and it was a Distinguished
Service Cross award to one of Mary's uncles. Well, I
thought: The family has some distinguished military men in it.


It was a hot and humid night, and I couldn't sleep well
because of worry about Freddie's condition, which the future
would prove to be very definitely a healthy, normal one. I was

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00066&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I reflected further, I remembered an incident in my youth
that caused me much pain and later feelings of guilt. My father
was in the backyard doing something and I was in my bedroom
playing with his Mauser .32 automatic pistol. I had sneaked into
his desk and got it out to play with, as I had done many times
when he was not at home. Today, as usual, I removed all the
bullets from the magazine (or so I thought) and was playing
a game. I would point the gun at my head and pull the trigger
and then listen to the metallic click. Twice I did this, and the
next time I pointed the gun out the window directly at my father.
I was about to pull the trigger when a force that I cannot explain
seemed to cause my arm to swing to the right, and the gun
fired. The bullet entered a plank not far away from Dad. I
dropped the gun and realized that I had almost shot my father,
but for the grace of God.


Now, twenty-one years later, I thought of this incident and
remembered the quiet, gentle way my father asked what happened,
and without a trace of anger consoled me when I told
him the circumstances of the accident. I asked myself if I could
have carried guilt subconsciously all these years. The words of
Socrates rang in my mind, "Wherefore, O judges, be of good
cheer about death, and know of a certainty, that no evil can
happen to a good man, either in life or after death. He and his
are not neglected by the gods." I also thought of the ringing
words of Solomon, which tell us: I have been young and I have
been old, and I have yet to see the seed of a righteous man
beg bread." Now was I not ill and in the hospital, yet on full
salary, with the government protecting my family and treating
me? The family was safe and well, and my father was really a
strong and good man. I never had seen him drink liquor or
heard him speak slanderously of anyone; nor had I detected
envy and hatred in his heart.

[p. <i>69</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00067&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My father and I had talked of death on his last visit with
me. He had pointed out that he knew God would redeem his
soul from the grave, and that when I was so acutely ill he had
prayed so earnestly in my behalf that he felt the ground shake.
And it is written that "The prayer of a righteous man avails
much." I resolved then to be as good a man as possible, in order
to assure the protection of my children by the same God that
had protected me. If only I was as strong as my father! I had
never known him to be ill one day during my lifetime.


Could it really be true that a good person was under the
protection of the gods? Surely the good suffer as well as the
evil, and certainly they are not rewarded materially as are
the evil in this world. But perhaps the good receive a greater
reward. I began to think of the good men, tried and true, that
I had known in my lifetime—my father, the Reverend Mr. Town,
Sr., Dr. Grabes, Mr. Morehouse, and a few teachers I had known.
These men all had some things in common—strength, integrity,
faithfulness to their wives, and very little money. They had my
respect, whereas the social climbers and other so-called successful
persons in the community, in terms of rank, prestige, and
success, I had only liked. There was an enormous difference
between the two—those respected and those only liked. Respect
is the more honorable of the two. And as far as success goes,
isn't the man who labors honestly successful? I asked myself
who were the men truly remembered and honored in life. It
was those men whom humanity had come to respect. The
greatest of men were often born without social rank, and just
as often without money. Then it was true; material success does
not necessarily bring honor and respect.


The noise of ambulances passing in the distance distracted
my thinking, and I finally fell asleep. I awakened on Saturday
morning exhausted. I evidently had not slept too soundly, for
I felt as if I had been up all night. Mary was lying beside me
crisp and cool in a white gown with black curls coming to a
triangular point on her forehead, called, I believe, a "widow's
peak." I hoped indeed that she would not be a widow, for I
wanted to live very badly now. I had a son and daughter who

[p. <i>70</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00068&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had come a long way, but there was still a long way to go.
"The race is not to the swift, the battle not to the strong, nor
knowledge to the wise, but to him that endureth to the end."
I must endure.


Today, we took Freddie to call on other relatives, so they
could get a look at him. Everyone said he was the very image
of me, as indeed he is. People who saw me thought I looked
well, though a bit thin. We spent the day looking for a house,
as Mary was anxious to have our family together again. I had
not seen Sharon since December, 1958, when she was a baby.
Now she was seventeen months old. She was a very cute little
thing with carrot-red hair, and Mary and I both chuckled as I
recalled when Sharon was born. Our English maid looked at her
when we brought her home from the hospital, and exclaimed,
"My God, she's white!"


We had no luck finding a house or an apartment, so we gave
up for the day and went home. Mary put Freddie to bed, and
we went out to dinner at Alfred's Steak House in the section
of Washington known as Georgetown. The food was excellent
and the atmosphere was pleasant. I felt very strong. We left
the restaurant, and with Dr. Peet and Dr. Funderbacker went
to a party given by one of the nurses at the hospital where Dr.
Peet was a resident. All the doctors were there, letting their
hair down, and one of them said they were the "lions of Washington."
One of the interns who was not really on the inside of
the group said that he was also a lion, and felt like roaring.
Major Hamp said, "Marvin, you don't have enough calcium in
your teeth to be a lion." I danced with my wife and felt as
though the two of us were one.


Sundays were always bad days for me when I was on weekend
visits. I became restless and edgy at the prospect of going
back to the hospital, and sirice Mary had to leave in the early
afternoon to get back home before dark, I would have to spend

[p. <i>71</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00069&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Washington is quite a town for parties, and someone is
always having one, even on Sundays, so the fellows and I went
to another party that night, and soon it was time to go back
to the hospital. I got there just in time for lights out. I couldn't
sleep well again, so I spent a good portion of the night talking
to the nurse on duty and drinking orange juice, which was kept
on the ward for patients. In fact, a lot of the patients were
awake this evening. A patient in the next room said he was
awakened by a dream in which death was standing over him.


I had begun to get the swing of things in the dental clinic,
and today there would be a new officer in charge. I put on my
uniform with the appropriate rank (that of captain), and with
shoes gleaming, I went downstairs to the office. The new dentist
was pleasant and easy to get along with, though something of
a nut himself. He had a syringe with a long needle made from
a coat hanger in the form of a corkscrew with a drop of red
wax on the end, and he would go to the waiting room and
ask who was next, waving his special syringe in the air. Needlesss
to say, it caused quite a bit of anxiety among the dental patients.
One of the dental patients did, in fact, remark to me, "The new
dentist should be upstairs with the rest of the nuts." He, of
course, not realizing that I myself was one of the "nuts upstairs."


I was working well now; the old familiar procedures were
coming back, and things seemed to be falling into place. My
hand worked marvelously; there was no stiffness in the fingers,
and my arm long since had stopped hurting. I still had my old
manual dexterity and work went along smoothly. I did feel
uncomfortable in having a man of lesser rank and experience
supervise me. This, however, was the only way out. You had to
work yourself out of this kind of hospital by proving that you
could take care of yourself, and that you were competent enough
to return to your profession.


That afternoon during the session with my doctor, I told him

[p. <i>72</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00070&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Bill informed me that headquarters command had inquired
about me, and he had told them that I was undergoing
intensive psychotherapy, and would require some more months
of treatment, and this evidently satisfied them. I had by now
begun to complain of the severe weight that seemed to be on
the top of my head, and that I felt it sometimes in my legs also.
The doctor's reply was that it probably was due to nervous tension.
My doctor had weaned me off of the drugs and tranquilizers
I had been taking, and I felt stronger and more robust.


By this time after working in the morning and attending sessions
with my doctors in the early afternoon, I was in the habit
of taking a walk in the late afternoon before dinner. My legs
were getting stronger now, as well as the rest of my body. I
had been bedridden for so long that it would take a long time
for the unused muscles to be fit again. That afternoon the sun
was setting and the outline that the setting sun seemed to form
was that of a burning river, and it made me shiver.


On returning to the ward, I began conversing with a Major
Thomas, who informed me of the time he had wasted in going
from doctor to doctor instead of coming to the hospital in the
beginning. He had gotten to the point that he could hardly see,
and, of course, he worried so about it that he attempted suicide.
It seems that these would-be suicides could be prevented, for
even though a patient attempts to conceal what he plans to do,
he somehow usually indicates to someone close to him that he
intends to commit suicide. If he was taken seriously under these
circumstances, many tragedies could be averted.


Tonight there was a birthday party on the ward for a female

[p. <i>73</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On Thursday Captain Belmar Addison and his wife, Dorothy,
came to see me. We had been stationed together in England.
He felt I was getting along fine now, and wanted me to go to
Hampton, my wife's home, with them this week end. I didn't
feel up to the trip, so I didn't go. I am sure Mary wondered why
I didn't come with them, since I didn't have to drive. So I called
her Sunday and explained that the trip probably would have
been too tiring for me. I think this really was an excuse, because
I did not want to face the family and friends who were sure
to come to see me. I also felt extremely guilty when around
the children, and it would be some time before this feeling of
guilt would leave me.


I spent hours in the library reading all sorts of things, especially
religious works and Shakespeare. I had begun being a
student again. As I had not studied anything but science and
related courses in college, I discovered that I had missed a lot
in the fine arts and humanities. So this neglected part of my
education was cultivated with great care and deliberation.
Through my studies I began to find the faith so necessary to
have in any illness.


The next afternoon I got a pass and went into the city to
look at a house but it was not satisfactory. It was neglected,
and not in a section of the city that Mary and I wanted live in.
On the bus back to the hospital I saw a girl I had been in
college with and avoided meeting her. The bus passed the public
library, and I observed the engraved lettering above the door:
"The past is prologue." I remember thinking about what "prologue"
meant. I resolved, in addition to my other studies, to
wade through the dictionary also. The past was indeed prologue,
as my doctor pointed out some months ago, when he discovered
I was living in the past. He felt that I should forget about the
past as it only aroused unconscious feelings of guilt. He showed

[p. <i>74</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was beginning to feel much better as I progressed through
the weeks and months of my hospitalization. Tangled emotions
were being set in order, and I felt no fear anymore and little
frustration. I very seldom got angry and, most important of all,
I was beginning not to hate myself anymore. However, the dissipation
of these feelings seemed to be replaced by a feeling
of heaviness on my back and head.


Mother and Dad arrived that week on Friday afternoon, after
a six-hour trip from North Carolina. They came faithfully the
first of each month. Everyone's spirits were much higher, now
that I seemed to be doing so much better, and the tension had
eased out of Dad's face. He was feeling better, since I was
making good progress. When those you love are sick or otherwise
hurt, or experience disappointment, one feels the same
agony that the love object feels.


We left the hospital and spent the week end with friends,
an engineer and his wife who stayed with us when he was in
college in my home town. Since his wife was a nurse, I wondered
if she would be able to detect any outward sign of my illness.
The week end went smoothly, and Mother and Dad left feeling
much more encouraged than they had at any previous visit.
Before coming back to the hospital, I saw an old friend, Jane Joe,
that I had courted when I was in college. We had a pleasant
chat and visited some of her other friends.


I had reached the point now where it was extremely difficult
to make the transition from that of freedom to that of total
dependency on the hospital, and the feelings of depression on
coming back to the hospital after a week end in the city had
become intensified. I hated with a grand passion even the idea
of having to come back to the ward. I had progressed from
looking forward only to eating as a form of pleasure, to being
overwhelmingly excited about working regularly in the hospital
dental clinic.

[p. <i>75</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Today an emergency patient came to see the officer in charge
of the dental clinic, complaining of an infected wisdom tooth.
He felt it was advisable to extract it, proceeded forthwith to do
so and promptly landed in trouble. As I was there and had been
trained extensively in oral surgery, the complication that he ran
into was no problem for me. I finished the operation for him,
and the old confidence and self-esteem flowed all through me.
For the first time in six months I felt really good and confident
again.


My heart literally sang with happiness as I went to see my
doctor that afternoon. He was on the phone talking to a general
when I went into his office. The general seemed to be giving
him a hard time, and he seemed to be having difficulty explaining
his thoughts to the party on the other end of the line. When
he finished talking, he turned to me and said, "Some people think
they are God, don't they?" I could see he was angry, so I made
no comment about it other than to point out that he was letting
his hostility show, at which point he laughed and said he had
better come to grips with himself.


About the only complaint I had to talk over with him was
the feeling of heaviness on top of my head that I can best
describe as two trucks sitting there. He felt this sensation would
go away in time, and assured me that I should not worry. He
informed me that he had been getting good reports on my
work in the dental clinic, and next month he would see about
my going back to work at the larger base dental clinic. This
would really be the giant step in my rehabilitation. It would
entail a full working day under normal military conditions, with
my receiving supportive therapy from him while living in the
hospital. This sounded great to me, and at long last I could see
the fruits of his great work toward getting me on my feet again
and back to a normal life. He would make the necessary arrangements
with the base dental surgeon and in approximately
one month I would really be in the swing of things again.


That night I felt like celebrating, so I went to the officers'
club and discovered they were having a "stag night." This is
a night especially reserved for men, and women are not allowed

[p. <i>76</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was strong now, and could stand on my feet for fairly long
stretches of time. The only discomfort was the feeling of a weight
on the top of my head and neck from time to time. In addition
to that, my legs had begun to feel so heavy that sometimes it
was very difficult to lift them. These sensations were uncomfortable,
but much more endurable than the feelings of fear
and anxiety that caused a rapid heartbeat and a state of perpetual
tension.


I had begun to sleep better and had lost the feeling of
being afraid just at the point of waking up. I had felt this acute
sense of fear for more than a year now, and it was quite a
relief to lie semiconscious, and not be afraid when I awakened
in the mornings. In fact, I was getting out of bed with a bounce
in the mornings, and was really caught up in the idea of working
regularly.


It was no ordeal at all now to get up in the mornings and
shave, shower, and get ready for the day's activity. For the first
time in months, I wanted to be busy doing things and keeping
active. It still was a very long wait from breakast at six thirty
until ten o'clock, the beginning of the work day. A lot of this
time was spent in chatting with other patients, and reading.


During this time, one morning, I was in the hallway where
the public telephone was, and a patient was conversing on the
phone. He started the conversation in English and abruptly
changed to Spanish. The phones on this ward were monitored
and all conversations were played back to the doctors, so that
no wrong information could go from a patient to the outside.
If a patient said something to alarm a relative or friend, his
telephone privileges were suspended. The doctors, I thought,
would have a hard time deciphering that last phone call. It was
not likely that the authorities would call in a linguist to translate.

[p. <i>77</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was a busy morning for the nurses on the closed ward.
They had received a planeload of patients, and some of them
were still lined up in the hallway waiting to be taken to their
rooms. Some other patients were on the patio playing volley ball.
Out of curiosity, I went back to the closed ward and played
ping-pong with another patient until it was time to go to work.
As far as I knew, this was the only ping-pong table in the hospital,
and my game had improved to the point where I had begun
to play rather well. The ping-pong table in actuality was placed
on this ward to observe the coordination of the patients. This
enabled the doctors to determine much about the patients'
condition.


That morning in the clinic we were doing the physical
examination of the patients who had recently arrived on the
psychiatric ward. I could see in their faces the despair that I
had known not so very long ago. I examined these patients
very carefully and gingerly, with a great degree of compassion.
We were soul brothers. I had demonstrated my ability to the
officer in charge now, and he frequently left the clinic and visited
the operating rooms, and I was left in command.


By this time I was working in the clinic in the morning and
late afternoon after the session with my doctor. I was doing a
lot of oral surgery of the emergency type, on patients who were
in the hospital. It was during this period that I became interested
in hypnosis. A pilot had crashed on the flight line, and they
brought him to the emergency operating room next door to my
office. He was in extreme pain with a broken leg. There were no
anesthetists available, since they were all busy in the operating
rooms at that time. A flight surgeon came by and induced a
trance in the flyer and set his leg without using anesthesia; and
those who witnessed this operation can attest to the value
of hypnosis in the practice of medicine. I talked with this doctor
when he was finished and found out that he was an enthusiastic
practitioner of this wonderful art. We went to his office, and I
borrowed his textbooks on the subject. I seriously began the
study of this old and ancient art.

[p. <i>78</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I studied the power of suggestion and especially effects
of autosuggestion, I began to realize that the pessimism and
defeatism that had characterized my illness was a form of suggestion
to myself. I had in effect told myself for so long that
I wouldn't get well, that in fact this had delayed the healing
process. Now I felt I should try to swing the pendulum in the
opposite direction. I suggested to myself that I felt good and
well, and, of course, I did feel better. This type of positive
autosuggestion has been used for centuries as well as being
used negatively. I had ample time to pursue the subject and
plenty of patients to practice on in the ward. I also had a doctor
who was willing to supervise me in the constructive use of this
subject.


My sessions were getting shorter with my doctor now. We
had gone over my whole life in minute detail, and he had
laboriously pointed out the possible effects that certain situations
had on my life and shown whether I had reacted from a
mature or immature point of view. He said he was well pleased
with the state of my mental health now, and that I had made
tremendous progress.


After dinner that day I talked to a woman, a commissioned
officer, who had, in a moment of depression over a broken marriage,
attempted suicide. She felt that she was utterly lost and
had nothing to live for any more. I could not understand the
depth of her feelings since I had not lost a loved one other
than my brother in Korea. I had been close to my brother and
had emulated him as a boy growing up. We had traveled together,
partied together, and generally had a close and fine
relationship. I had felt heartbreak and sorrow, but not despair
to the point of seeking oblivion.


So often, I suppose, in order to reach a glimmer of understanding,
one has to live through an ordeal himself I felt
sympathy for her, but did not know the effects of this most
powerful emotion called love when the loved object rejects one.
It would appear that it causes as much pain as a physical illness.
Some patients thought that if her husband did not want

[p. <i>79</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I really felt better now, and the old confidence came back;
the only time I felt badly was when the pressure of weight on
my head and back came on, which was more frequently now
and lasted for longer periods of time. During these episodes,
I felt as if someone had placed his hands on the top of my head
and was pushing down with all his might. There seemed to be
no medical reason or evidence to support this feeling. My head
had been re-X-rayed and my doctors could not find a clue as to
the reasons for these feelings. As so often in a case where there
is no clinical reason for these manifestations, the feelings are
relegated to psychosomatic causes.


I had long since lost the feelings of fear and acute anxiety,
and now felt that good progress was being made, and I had no
worries financially or emotionally (I thought), and could not
find a reason for this feeling of weight. The fact that I hated
to return to the hospital after week-end visits indicated to the
doctors that I was getting well, as so many previous months
had been spent not wanting to do anything at all.


As I had injured my head when I dived from the bed to
the concrete floor when I was acutely ill, I thought that perhaps
this might be the reason for the feeling of weight. I discussed
it with my doctor, and he assured me that there was no injury
or brain damage in any form. He felt that in time and in the
proper environment that this weight feeling would be dispelled.


This week was spent, when I wasn't busy in the clinic and
in conference with my doctor, looking for an apartment or a

[p. <i>80</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

All during my illness, Mother and Dad never lost faith that
I would recover, and wrote encouraging letters and showed great
interest in my condition to the proper hospital authorities.
Their faith never wavered, or if it did I was not aware of it.
My friends encouraged me by their visits, and my wife was
truly wonderful. She had traveled to see me for almost a year
now, and did not show the extreme tension I knew she was
under.


I might note here that none of the relatives on my wife's
side who resided in Washington ever visited me while I was
in the hospital. To my way of thinking, this appeared rather
strange. I had found the necessary faith to endure my illness
through the pursuit of religious literature, and this religious
orientation would sustain me during the long, dark months
ahead.


Others had been mentally ill and returned to a useful and
productive life in the community, and I would do it, too. I now
had a faith strong enough to move mountains. With the finding
of this necessary ingredient to make all sick people well, I had
begun to sleep better at night and spent relatively few sleepless
hours. I worked, studied, and reflected, and believed that because
of this discipline my memory was improving. I certainly
was being introduced to a world of ideas by truly great and
creative thinkers.


It seemed like a coincidence, or was it really? The vast majority
of patients on the ward during the initial stages of their
illness believed that they should go to church, or had dreams
of church, or sought their ministers out for help. I realize that
it is a psychiatric truism that schizophrenics are religiously
oriented as a rule, but it seems to be something inexplicable

[p. <i>81</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had found willing subjects for my experience in hypnosis,
and they cooperated with a grand passion. Since there was
nothing better for most of them to do, the time was well spent.
After several weeks of studying the history of the subject and
building up confidence that I could do it, I began practicing
with my first patient, and soon I found I could induce a trance
rather easily. The patients and I spent many hours in this endeavor.
I found that the relaxation that is normal under hypnosis
could cause a reduction in headaches, anxiety, tension, and cause
pain to be relieved. I had no lack of patients to learn on, and
even my doctor got into the act by giving me the benefit of
his training and experience in the subject. He felt the more
interests I had, the better off I would be.


After dinner I spent a great deal of time in the officers' club.
It was merely a way of passing time, and the change momentarily
in environment was good. Several of the officers who were
patients with me had acquired the habit of going to the club
in the evening to break the monotonous routine of the ward. We
did not drink whiskey, however, since this was a sure way
to have all privileges suspended, as we had occasion to witness
among many of the male patients who had gone home on weekend
visits and had come back drunk. They promptly found
themselves under lock and key again, with all privileges
suspended.


Every week or so some of the patients were sent home, back
to duty, to another military hospital, or to a veterans' hospital
for further treatment; and every time one of them left for home
or back to duty, there was a celebration on the ward. Tonight,
when we returned to the ward, the celebration was going full
blast, with punch and cookies. A lady was being discharged
in the morning. This had been her third time in the hospital,

[p. <i>82</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On talking to my doctor today, he decided that perhaps
withdrawal from the massive doses of tranquilizers I had been
taking had led to the sensation of heaviness I felt. He then
decided to try me for a month on a mild tranquilizer and an
antidepressant. From today on I would begin the battle to lose
the feeling of heaviness on my head and in my back. I would
have to get used to the routine of going again to the nurses'
station to get my medication.


Today my friend Cooper Percival came to see me. He and
I had been in college together, and from there we went to
dental school. He was a year ahead of me, and we lived together
our last year in school. Coop was engaged to be married
now. "At long last some young tender has captured you, old
boy. It's about time," I said. Cooper had been a good student
and somewhat of a lady's man in school. In fact, it had been
difficult for him to study during the first two years due to
tenders chasing him and being in and out of his apartment
continually. I signed out for the officers' club, and we went over
there to have dinner. Cooper teased me, saying he knew I was
a nut all along, and it was about time someone caught up
with me.


When we were in school our last year, all of our friends
had agreed to put so much money in a pot, to be given to anyone
who made love to more tenders in one month. The conditions
were that the girls had to be unknown to us. Cooper won handily
with an enormous score to his credit. I had seen him when I
was stationed in England, and we had gone out on the town
together. I was cheered immensely by his visit, and it felt like
high old times to be in the presence of the "King of Tenders,"
as we called him in school.


Today there was a lot of excitement on the ward. Two new

[p. <i>83</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Mary arrived this week and saw me feeling badly,
she was very disappointed, as I had been so cheerful on her
previous visits. The feeling of a weight on my head had returned,
and although it was nowhere near as oppressive as depression,
or even debilitating, it was nevertheless very uncomfortable, and
it was difficult to function properly. We signed out of the hospital
and went to Mom Hoskins' for the week end. Although I
did not feel too much like participating, with my head and legs
feeling like lead, I did join her in the relentless search we were
making for a house. We had a lead and went to look at another
house. We found that this one, of the many row houses in Washington,
suited our purposes, and we decided to take it. The
landlord would draw up the lease and I would sign it the next
week. It was a lovely two-bedroom house with living room,
dining room, kitchen and bath—just right for a family of four.
It even had a basement for the children to play in, and it was
located in the middle-class Negro district. We were very pleased,
to say the least.


Sometimes the feeling of lead weights on me would go, and
I didn't have to drag around anymore. During these times I felt
full of pep and energy—full of the joy of life. We went to a
French restaurant and had a marvelous meal, complete with
French pastry. We had traveled to Paris three times when I
was in England, and had experienced the delightful French food
many times. We had, in fact, visited Paris in the springtime,
when Mary was pregnant with Freddie.


While there we met a French photographer and his wife
who were friendly to us and took us sight-seeing. We had a lot
in common, as I dabbled in amateur photography of the color
variety. It was a chance in a lifetime to travel through the city
with another photographer, one who knew the inside of that

[p. <i>84</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I shuddered when I remembered that almost a year ago
I had decided to leave her and the children forever. My wife,
my life. We both felt very romantic, and she leaned across the
table and whispered, "Let's go to a hotel." I felt like a schoolboy
at his first sexual initiation. It was always like the very
first time when we made love. I felt as if I were seducing her
all over again. We went to a hotel without any luggage, and the
clerk raised his eyebrows. The only thing that saved me was my
military I.D. card. He smiled and mentioned something about
a second honeymoon, and Mary blushed. Mary had purchased
a yellow nightgown for the occasion, and she was really beautiful
and radiant.


Next morning we slept late and had breakfast sent up to
our room, and as we had nothing better to do, we decided to
take in a cinema. The feeling of lead had returned, and I
dragged myself together as best I could and we sat through
the movie. When it was finished I could hardly stand up. We
went out on the street and walked past another movie. I wanted
to go in because I felt badly and wanted to sit down again. I
gave Mary the excuse that I just had to see this one too. She
graciously consented, saying that if it made me happy she would
be delighted. By the time this movie was over, I had returned
to normal and felt well and strong again.


Mary had flown to Washington this time. As she didn't feel

[p. <i>85</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00083&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The entire evening was spent in discussing the integration
movement that was beginning on a mass scale in America. All
of us were very pleased that such a movement had begun. We
had all suffered the indignities of living in a segregated society.
When we were students in Washington, the movies downtown
were not available to us, and the restaurants were also restricted.


We had in fact gone to professional school at Howard University,
because at that time Negroes were not permitted to
attend schools on a graduate or college level at the Southern
white universities. Because of this, southern state legislation
had been passed to give out-of-state aid to Negroes who were
pursuing degrees beyond the Bachelor of Science level. These
students, if they received an advanced degree at this time, were
required to study in the North and West. Facilities in hotels
were also denied to persons of other than the Caucasian race.
There were special sections in the trains for Negroes to sit,
when traveling south, which I always refused to obey when
traveling to my home in North Carolina. This battle for integration
would affect us all intimately.


We were all a little tired of being reminded that we were
not white from the time that we arose in the morning to bedtime
at night. The younger generation of Negroes had come
to realize that if they could bleed and die in defense of America,
their country, in turn, could and should afford them their civil
rights.


The mass sit-in demonstrations had their beginnings in my
home town in North Carolina. They were initiated by a young
junior who was a student of the Agricultural and Technical
College of North Carolina. He had sat down at a lunch counter
in the downtown area, and was asked to move, which of course
he refused to do. And the movement that would reverberate
throughout the world was on.


Significantly enough, one of the greatest of social revolutions

[p. <i>86</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00084&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next morning we were joined by a group of friends for
breakfast. We traveled to a not-too-distant Army base where
the officers' club looked like a country-club building. The girls
were very beautiful. Breakfast for me did not last long enough.
The club was beautiful and very restful. Mary's flight back home
was at five fifty-five that evening, and I would not have to return
to the hospital as soon as I ordinarily did on Sundays.


After eating we went swimming. On coming out of the water,
I felt as if I was weighted down by a fishing net. I had discovered
that, whenever I experienced this feeling of weight,
if I rested for about an hour, it would go away and I would feel
normal again. So I began to break my day by having several
rest periods, and in this way I could function more normally.


After spending the afternoon at this lovely club, one of my
friends and his brother rushed us back to Washington and the
Municipal Airport. Mary received quite a bit of attention, as
she always did when she entered public places. People turned
to look at her and then at me. She was a princess. A feeling
of sadness came to me as we waited for the plane. I felt so
alone when she left me. I soon began to feel the agitation and
restlessness that I always experienced when I had to return
to the hospital. We put her on the plane and traveled the five
or more miles back to the city, where a series of parties were
getting into full swing. We stopped by the District of Columbia
General Hospital and collected Dr. Funderbacker and several

[p. <i>87</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00085&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

On returning, I changed into the hospital pajamas and went
to bed, thinking of the wonderful week end I had just experienced.
I was too restless to sleep, so I got up and called my
family in Virginia. I spoke with the children and Mary and felt
better. Each time I had called them her father had wanted to
talk with me, but I had refused out of a feeling of shame.
Tonight, I talked with him, and he told me that everyone was
pulling for me, and to hang on and everything would be all
right. His wife had died five months after Mary and I were
married. We were in Europe at the time, and Mary could not
come home to the funeral. Her mother had had an unexpected
heart attack and had died immediately.


I fell into a disturbed sleep and woke in the morning tired,
so tired that after breakfast I went back to bed until it was
lime to report to work. On reporting, I found that the other
dentist was not there. He had gone on sick call. Some sort of
virus was passing around the hospital, and he was another
victim. This meant that for the day I was in full charge of the
clinic. Some airmen were waiting for their routine physical examination,
which I promptly gave them, and then a familiar
face came through the door and said, "Hello, Jinx." It was
Colonel Wolf, with whom I had been stationed at a Royal Air
Force base about seventy-six miles from London. It turned out
that he was up for retirement too. He had developed chronic
back trouble, and the Air Force was retiring him. He was my
last patient for the morning, and we spent some time talking.
His family was well; his daughter had been a former patient of
mine. I had put braces on her teeth, and he was proud to say
that her teeth were all straight now. It is always nice to see
the proud parent of a pleased patient. Early in my service career,

[p. <i>88</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00086&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After lunch I went back to the ward, and there was a hubbub
of confusion. One of the patients on the closed ward had
secured a razor somehow and had attempted suicide by cutting
his tongue. My doctor was in the emergency-treatment room
with him, so I had to postpone my session with the doctor for
today. This patient had been suffering from enormous feelings
of guilt and had been given electric-shock treatments. Electrodes
are placed on the head and the current is increased to the point
where the patient loses consciousness, in this form of treatment.
It is generally believed by psychiatrists that, with a series of
such shock-therapy treatments, the patient's guilt feelings are
minimized and he can reorient himself. Somehow or other this
patient's feelings of guilt were related to his tongue, and he
used this organ as a medium for self-punishment.


As I had nothing better to do, I went downstairs to the
library, and on arriving I began to feel the lead-like sensation.
I resolved to ignore the feeling, and since I would be sitting
down, I would not be bothered by it. Today I decided to study
more philosophy, and proceeded to acquaint myself with some
thoughts of Descartes. The afternoon fairly flew along, and soon
it was time for dinner. I went to the officers' dining room and ate.


Tonight was Monday night; it would be two long weeks
before Mary would come again. That was a long time to sit
around the hospital. I had not yet gone on week-end passes
by myself, as I probably needed the security of being with
someone who loved me. I did not feel too much like going into
the city alone, since most of my friends were not married, and
after work the rule was to indulge in a series of parties. I did
not have the inclination for this sort of thing, nor did I enjoy
them without my wife. Consequently I stayed in the hospital
and waited for either Mary or my parents to come to
Washington.


By now, at the end of the day, I was utterly exhausted and
felt the leaden heaviness so much that it was difficult to keep
my head erect. I had to lie down, and the medicine I was taking

[p. <i>89</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00087&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had gotten permission by telephone from my doctor to go
to the city tomorrow and sign the lease for our new home.
Finding a house was a huge step in my rehabilitation program.
With my family here in the city, I could look forward to spending
my nights with them. I would be like any other ordinary
workingman going to work in the morning and coming back
at night. After work Tuesday I went into Washington to sign
the lease that the landlord had drawn up. I was not prepared
for the disappointment that lay ahead for me. He had inquired
at the base about me and learned that I was a mental patient
at the hospital, and being ignorant of this kind of illness, he
believed the centuries-old stigmata attached to it. He embarrassedly
informed me that the deal was off. I tried to explain to
him the hardships my wife and I experienced in trying to find
a house for our family in order to be together, but he was apparently
unmoved. I tried hard to control the hostility that was
rising in my breast toward him. I spent the rest of the afternoon
going to real estate offices and calling friends to get them
to help me in this dilemma.


When I returned to the hospital, I phoned Mary and gave
her the bad news, but even in the face of this adversity she was
still quite optimistic about the whole thing. We had found one
house; surely we could find another. This was another example
of the intolerance exhibited toward the mentally ill that reaches
from the typical man in the street to the law-enforcement
agencies and on up to the legislative bodies that make laws
governing the treatment and confinement of mentally ill patients.

[p. <i>90</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00088&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I was in subsequent months to discover the apathy and indifference
that exists among both the public and politicians
toward the mentally ill. One half of all hospital beds in America
are occupied by the mentally ill. In a huge number of cases,
this need not be so.


With the proper treatment of therapy, concern, diagnosis,
and love, even the most seriously disturbed can be returned
to the community in a creative and meaningful capacity. The
public at large thinks of the crazy person as not having knowledge
of what he is doing or saying, of having no feelings, and so
incapable of integrating into society that he is removed literally
to a prison atmosphere for the good of society and himself.


Often after entering a hospital where in a large majority of
cases there is an inadequate staff of doctors, nurses, and attendants,
he is sometimes wrongly diagnosed; therefore treatment of
a wrong type is instituted. In cases where there is not a loved one
on the outside to intercede for him, he is shipped to a back
ward of a state hospital and stays there—progressively deteriorating
both mentally and physically while waiting for death
to release him from his agony of mind and body.


It has been estimated that with proper treatment and an
understanding home to go to, one half of the patients presently
confined could be released. So often in this kind of illness,
relatives desert their loved ones and find excuses for doing so.
It was very fortunate that I had loved ones interested in my
welfare, and they stayed behind the doctors on my behalf.


Seriously needed in America is a proper source of financing
to make additions to mental hospitals and adequately staff them.
There is also needed a public-education system to acquaint the
masses at large with the needs and problems of the mentally
ill. As in most things, we are not interested until the malady
strikes at home. With a concentrated, combined effort on a
federal and public level, miracles could be wrought in this most
debilitating of all modern man's diseases.


In my session today after work with my doctor, I could not
help showing my disappointment at not being able to rent

[p. <i>91</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00089&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The month of August was passing rapidly, and I had made
no progress in finding a house. Things were going so badly on
the housing front that Mary and I decided to buy one for the
present, and rent it out if we left Washington. We could find
more houses for sale than for rent, which caused us to make
this decision.


The week ends that I spent in the hospital were very long
indeed. There was no work to do except for an occasional emergency
in the dental clinic. The physical-therapy section of the
hospital was closed. The snack bar was closed; and the only
thing to do of interest was to read and watch television. On
week ends I usually spent hours with the patients, inducing
hypnotic trances till I became quite professional at it. The work
I did in hypnosis was limited to inducing the trance and suggesting
feelings of numbness in the face and jaws and hands.
Since eventually I hoped I would be using this method to
ameliorate pain in dental work, I practiced for hours and hours,
day after day. I attempted no hypnotherapy with the patients,
as I had no psychiatric background. It was amazing to witness
the relief from profound depression that could be gained temporarily
from a hypnotic trance.


Other aches and pains could also be reduced to a minimum.
I had no children on whom to practice the altogether different

[p. <i>92</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00090&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had begun to use hypnosis routinely in the clinic under the
flight surgeon's supervision. One day we were not especially
busy, and he and I spent a few minutes inducing all the patients
in the waiting room of the dental clinic section. I was beginning
to use it for fillings, extractions, and examinations of apprehensive
patients, and the results were tremendous.


This Sunday a friend of mine and former classmate in school,
Dr. Jim Whiting, came to see me. He had been quite a talker
in school and had talked for eight hours a day through four
years of dental school. We had been close during our dental-school
days, and it was swell to see him again. He was still
single, though accompanied by a very beautiful girl. Every time
I think of Jim I am reminded of the trips he and I took when
sophomores. On one we traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to
attend the Maharry Day dance at Maharry Medical College.
We had lots of acquaintances at Maharry and decided to spend
the Easter vacation there.


Negroes at that time were not allowed to ride any place
other than in the rear of buses, and of course they could not
eat in the main dining salons with the white passengers. We
stopped for dinner in the city of Crossville, Tennessee. The
white passengers were ushered into the main dining room,
and Jim and I were taken to the kitchen. Refusing to be
embarrassed, Jim ordered a meal to warm the cockles of any
gourmet's heart. He ordered lobster with Moselle wine; the
second course was bacon strips on some sort of greens with
Rhine wine. The main course was squab muscovy with sauterne.
At this point the maître d'hôtel, a Frenchman, came back to see
who was ordering this fine food in the kitchen. He was so impressed
with the menu that Jim had ordered that he had the
waiter transfer our food and table to the center of the main

[p. <i>93</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00091&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

August had passed very rapidly, and when Mary came on
her next trip we planned to look for houses to buy. I had to get
out of the hospital if I was to regain my mental health. I was
tired of being in the foreign environment of a hospital, and
I wanted to be with my family again. My doctor had promised
that as soon as my family was living in Washington I could join
them, and then I could come to see him approximately twice a
week as an out-patient. I had also decided to take the Washington
dental examination and practice in Washington. I was licensed
to practice in California, but Mary wanted to live in Washington
so she wouldn't be so far away from her relatives.


Dr. Bill was going on leave for a month, beginning the first
of September, and the other doctors on the staff would fill in for
him and see his patients. I had by this time lost the feelings
of fear, anxiety and depression, but they seemed to have been
replaced by the feeling of weight on my head, back and legs.
These sensations were beginning to come more frequently now,
and when they came I had to lie down. On getting up, however,
I felt normal.


Mother and Dad came on the first of the month just like clockwork.
We spent an enjoyable time in the city; in fact, we went
to Philadelphia for the week end to see relatives there. The
four-hour trip was exhausting for me. I just couldn't seem to
shake the heavy feeling that was so debilitating when it came.
We got back in time for the ten o'clock curfew of the ward.

[p. <i>94</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00092&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next day in the clinic I was a miserable soul. I had to
sit down most of the time, but fortunately there were no patients.
The lead feeling was beginning to last longer each time
now, and though there was no pain involved, it was still a miserable
feeling. In the afternoon I felt better and spent my time
in the library.


For the next two weeks the feelings of pressure were so
intense that I could not work regularly in the clinic. When
they became this intense, I had to spend my time in bed, as I
could not function properly. This was a bitter blow for me. I had
no one now, since my doctor was away on leave. The other
doctors examined me and could find no reason for my feeling
this way. I felt so badly that I had to stop work I couldn't go
on feeling this way, day in and day out.


The staff was under the impression that either I had had a
relapse or that I couldn't function adequately without the support
of my doctor. Either way this presented a gloomy prognosis.
By the time Dr. Bill returned from leave, I had stopped work
altogether. I was literally dragging myself around the ward.
I saw my doctor register disappointment, because he had
gotten me to the point where getting out of the hospital was
beginning to be a reality. But this setback, he thought, was only
temporary. He examined me again and found nothing physical
that could cause the feelings I described. He decided to switch
drugs and try something new. The new drugs removed the feeling
of heavy pressure but resulted in mental confusion. I was
between the devil and the deep blue sea. I could either feel
like lead and not function due to extreme feelings of heaviness,
or take the drugs that removed these feelings but left me in
mental confusion. We decided the former course was the best
one to proceed with. It was immeasurably better to feel like
lead than to be mentally disoriented. This setback to my progress

[p. <i>95</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00093&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When Mary came again to see me, she was heartsick with
the turn of events; she could not understand why I had stopped
working. We signed out of the hospital, but today I did not feel
like driving. It was so difficult to pick my legs up. I felt that
at this rate in a couple of months I would not be able to walk.


For the first time in a long time I did not want to go anywhere
or participate in normal activities. The strain was beginning
to show on Mary in the way she answered questions. She
was getting short in her answers and was visibly beginning to
lose patience. I felt very badly that week, very much like one
does when one has the flu. I did not feel up to making love
and only seemed able to lie around the house. I had to do
something to beat this thing, but what, I did not know. We
spent this week end as semi-recluses because of my not feeling
well. When it was time to return to the hospital this time, I did
not feel badly about it. All I wanted to do was to lie down.
Mary left me, bitterly disappointed, though she tried not to
show it.


The next two weeks were as bad as the previous two. I was
unable to work and stayed in my room mostly, lying down a lot.
I didn't even feel like bathing, and I did not feel refreshed
when I did. Dr. Bill tried everything he knew in the form of
drugs and psychotherapy, but to no avail. He said he did not
know what the answers were, and that only time would tell.
I had progressed to the point mentally where I was almost out of
the hospital, and now I began to worry whether I could support
my family in my semi-invalid condition. Dr. Bill informed
me that I would get a pension, and we could make do with it
This was a bit of good news.


During the fall my condition still did not improve much,
and it was aggravated by my worrying. The week-end visits
of my parents and Mary were discouraging for the three of them,
and I could not fully participate in the activities when they came.
I had stopped work completely by December, when Mary

[p. <i>96</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00094&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

One week before Mary and the children were to move to
Washington permanently, I began to have nightmares again. In
fact, Mary had also begun dreaming at this time. She dreamed
that she was going away on a train, and that the children were
outside saying good-by to her. At the same period of time I
was having dreams of trains—of being run over by them. When
I told Dr. Bill, he was visibly worried. Trains, it turned out,
were a psychiatric symbol of death.


Mary, the children, and her father arrived on Thursday to
move into the apartment. John, Sr., had come along to help with
the children, and to drive. Mary talked with the doctor and
then brought the children to see me. They looked well, and so
big! I decided not to go to the apartment with them. I felt too
badly and did not feel like cleaning up and moving. I told
Mary I would come home this week end, and her face fell in
disappointment. I felt terrible.


From my window I could see the four of them get in the car
and leave the hospital grounds. I felt a peculiar feeling of pride
when I saw Mary get into the car, a feeling that was close
to arrogance. I did not at all understand it. I felt better on
Friday, and went home. Mary was upstairs visiting a friend,
and I went to get her. We came back downstairs. Mary had done
a marvelous job. The apartment was beautiful, with modern
Danish furniture and a smashing light that pulled down from
the ceiling. Her dad had gone back home by this time. He
couldn't understand why I had not wanted to come home before
the week end.


After I played with the children for two hours, we went to a
neighborhood restaurant. I drank some beer, which made me
feel better but not drunk. We also had a pizza. She remarked
that the place looked like Alfred's Sandwich House in Copenhagen,
Denmark. We had gone there in 1957 and eaten in

[p. <i>97</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00095&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We returned home and danced to the music of my hi-fi unit.
We both felt very good. Freddie got up and wanted to talk with
his daddy. This was a very good feeling. At last I slept in my
own bed for the first time in more than a year. On Saturday the
house was full of visitors and well-wishers. It was like a house
warming. Now that Mary was here, Dr. Bill also wanted to see
her frequently, to help her with any problems that might
come up.


Sunday found me in a slump again, and the agitated feeling
of restlessness that preceded my having to go back to the
hospital. One would think one would adjust to having to go back
to the ward, but it was something I found difficult to do. The
hard part was going from a free environment to a confined
one. The adjustment made for harried nerves and changing
mental attitudes. I just lay around and couldn't get any pep or
vigor. I was miserable, which was bad for the children to see,
but I couldn't help myself. Mary was visibly displeased and was
beginning to show signs of impatience and disgust, even.
She was visibly displeased for the first time during my illness.
I attributed it to nervous tension and harried nerves.


I was beginning to feel miserable again and could not account
for it. I could not seem to get going at all. It was like having
the flu or a virus without a temperature. I felt awful, and
it affected the whole household. I had been so cheerful and was
functioning so well for the past few months that this turn of
events knocked the pins from under us both. As the hour of my
return to the hospital approached, I was very restless and could
not resist the urge to pace up and down. If I had not been so
concerned over how I felt, perhaps I might have noticed that
Mary was reaching the end of her rope. I should have been
able to see that her patience was coming to an end. I did not
give this a thought at the time, since she had been such a bulwark
of support in my sickness.


As she drove me to the hospital we didn't say very much.

[p. <i>98</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00096&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The next week I was full of apprehension and doubt and
apathy. I still could not work, although I tried. Dr. Bill came
to my room and found me on the bed. He had begun to grow
impatient with me. As I had stopped work and he could find
no reason for my alleged feeling, he thought I should be working
instead of lying around, and told me so. He said, "Get up
off your lard ass and go to work!" I said I didn't feel like working,
and he left the room.


The next week end at home was a duplication of the last
one. I felt so much like lead that I couldn't do anything constructive.
I didn't know what to do. I didn't feel depressed in
the way that I once did, but I certainly looked as though I was
depressed to everyone around me. I didn't even feel up to shaving,
so I let my beard grow like a man on vacation in the woods.
When I did lose the feeling of weight, I felt restless and agitated.
The pendulum was swinging back and forth in opposite directions
now—high and low, with no happy medium. We struggled
through a visit to the park with the children on Saturday, and
stayed home all day Sunday.


When I returned to the hospital that night, I got the
impression that several more members of the staff were getting
impatient with me.


On the next day Dr. Bill warned me that he could not keep
me there forever, and as he looked at me he said, "What a
waste," and that it would be a hell of a price to pay if I
didn't go back to work. I could not seem to make him understand
my feeling.


Christmas was coming next week, and all the ward was busy
decorating for the yuletide season. The patients had got a Christmas

[p. <i>99</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00097&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Bill evidently felt that depression was causing my feeling
of pressure, so he put me on some more medicine. The medicine
made me feel worse. Just before I went home for Christmas, I
had another dream. In the dream I was in a store, standing
behind the counter, and a huge black monster came in the
door. I struggled with him, and he finally stuck a three-pronged
pitehfork through my heart. I actually felt the pain that one
experiences during heartbreak.


I went home for Christmas, but experienced none of the
excitement one usually feels at this season of the year. The
tree was up and all the decorations were hung. The presents
had been bought and wrapped, waiting for Christmas night.
Friends in town came by to wish us a merry Christmas, and
we shared some yuletide cheer in the form of hot buttered rum.
Mary had bought me a beautiful lounging robe and pajamas, but
I felt only slightly better than last week end— nowhere near as
well as I had felt some months ago. We called all relatives
and wished them a merry Christmas, and everyone was pleased
that I was home to play Santa Claus for the children.


I had vowed to myself to pretend that I felt well so everyone
would have a happy holiday. So I pretended as best I could.
I dragged myself to parties and thought I was doing a good job
with the pretense, but it turned out I only fooled myself.
It was obvious to everyone that I was not well. Mary had grown
more impatient, and asked me for the first time if I loved
her and the children. I did the best I could to reassure her. I did
not want to worry her, so I tried to hide how miserable I
felt.


After the holidays I went back to the hospital and just about
gave up. Dr. Bill told me that I was digging a pit for myself.

[p. <i>100</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00098&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

That night as I lay beside her I had a strange dream. I
dreamed that a black shadow with two eyes was sliding under
the window I was sleeping next to. It began to choke me. I
was struggling to wake up when I had the third and last
experience of seeing in my own head the letter "I." This time,
as I was being choked, it seemed that this "I" was jumping
up and down.


When I went back to the hospital and stayed two days,
Dr. Bill informed me that I could not go home for a while till
I got myself together. This was a terrible blow to me, as the
week ends spent away from the hospital were the only days that
life was bearable.


I was lying on the bed half asleep and half awake when I
saw a jackass wearing a dunce's cap sitting at the foot of my
bed. Just at that time Dr. Bill came in the room, and I told
him of this. He laughed and said the jackass was me.


Dad came to see me that week, and I just couldn't get out
of the bed. Mary came in a few minutes later with the children,
and she had changed. Her attitude toward me was very cool
and distant. I remarked to her that she had changed, and she
didn't say a word. She said she wanted to take the children to
the snack bar, and asked if I would like to come along, but
I felt too badly to get up. So she turned and left the room,
which was not like her. Dad urged me to get up, but I
couldn't; I felt chained to my bed.


Since I could not go home any more, I felt useless and did
not even try to go to work. I stayed in bed, and Dr. Bill transferred

[p. <i>101</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048401-I00099&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Dr. Bill had changed drugs again, and I began to hallucinate.
I felt that my eyes were being burned out by the nurses. I
had become paranoid again, directly as a result of the drugs,
but I did not know this at the time. I just could not stand
being locked up anymore. It was making me sick all over again.
I planned to run away, and that night, after being given my
medication, I again hallucinated, and my heart felt as though
it would tear right through my chest. I waited until everyone
had gone to sleep and the corpsmen had opened the outside
door. I sneaked past the nurses' station on my hands and
knees and was out of the hospital in a flash. I cut across the back
of the hospital and was over the fence and away from the base
in a few minutes. I had to get away. I had overheard the
nurses discussing the disposition of my case. Dr. Bill had planned
to ship me to a veterans' hospital in Perrypoint, Maryland, for
chronic patients. I'd be damned if I would spend my life in a
hospital. I passed a house, walked through the woods, and got to
Washington and Mom's. I called Mary and told her where I was
and not to worry about me. One hour later, civilian police with
military police came to fetch me back to the hospital. I was
carried to a Marine detention barracks, where I was told to
wait till I could be sent back to the hospital. When I got back
they were waiting with pills to knock me out. I slept around
the clock, and awakened with a terrible drug hangover. I
stayed in my room and didn't even go to the Day Room with
the other patients.


Mary and her sister from New York came to see me and
stayed a few minutes. Her attitude was one of cool indifference.
I found another opportunity to escape, and sneaked past the
nurses' station again; only this time it was snowing. I took a
blanket, and in my pajamas was off again. I was desperate. The
snow came up to my ankles, but I was not even cold. I stopped

Dr. Bill gave me one more chance to work my way out of
the hospital, but I couldn't work. He probably knew what it
would mean in time, and probably domestic difficulties would
arise if I were "put away," and he did not want this to happen.
He kept telling me what a price I would have to pay if I didn't
get up.


Mary came and denied that she had told Dr. Bill where I
was. I was furious with her, as she was obviously lying. She
seemed to no longer care what happened to me. She informed
me that she was going to a dance this week end, and I asked
her who she was going with. She said she was going with some
friends. They were friends that I did not know.


Next week Mother and Mary came to rouse me from this
apathetic state I was in. They came to the waiting room,

It was now February, and it had been one month since her
attitude changed toward me. She was no longer warm and
tender toward me. Her visits were shorter, and she seemed to be
in a hurry to get away from me each time she came. This
time she evidently came to get permission to sell the car, get a
new one, and to change our bank account to her name. I signed
the necessary papers, and she was beginning to leave when I
asked her to let me come home this week end. She refused. She
was made my trustee by the Air Force, and met the board for
my retirement, as Dr. Bill felt it would prove too emotional for
me.
