<font size="4"><b>12: Television and Viewers' Behaviour Real or Elusive Links</b></font>

TONY CHARLTON AND CHARLIE PANTING


Learned behaviour is the product of complex connections between
individuals' biological make-up (non-genetic and genetic) and their environment.
For most children, elements of this learning equip them with the
personal and social skills essential for a healthy adjustment to their surroundings.
Thus, for instance, they become able to forge  and to sustain 
satisfactory relations with others. Lacking these life skills, youngsters
can encounter difficulties with their socialization efforts. Along these
lines, some have cautioned that there may be an alarming increase in the
number of people:


... entering adulthood with serious personal and social deficits, including
fragile ties to parents, difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships, weak
community attachments ... (Amato and Booth, 2001: 210)


More specific sources of individuals' personal and social problems
are heeded, too. For example, television is regularly accused of provoking
antisocial behaviour among youngsters (a claim just as frequently
challenged). With this allegation in mind, this chapter considers the
role that television may play in adversely affecting young viewers' behaviour.
In doing so, it reflects upon particular areas commonly accepted
as mediating any television viewing effects (identification, perceptions
of content reality, amount/type of viewing, social controls). The

Whilst the authors are mindful of the semantic confusion in the literature
concerning terms such as aggression, violence and antisocial behaviour,
these terms are used interchangeably in this chapter in order to
reflect particular usages across different studies.


<b>SOME CAUSES OF</b>


<b>ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR</b>


Efforts to extend our understanding of the aetiology of antisocial behaviours
commonly reflect upon factors within and outside the individual.
The within person perspective considers factors including the state of
the nervous system and certain glandular functions, heredity and genetic
considerations (Charlton and George, 1993: 17) and symptoms such as
stress, loss of hope and self-esteem, anxiety, stigma and powerlessness
(Cattell, 2001). The outside the person viewpoint generally pays attention
to the family, neighbourhood, community and school inquiring what
it is about respective social structures and cultures (Laub and Lauritsen,
1998: 128) that helps generate antisocial behaviour.


In reality, learned behaviour is the outcome of an elaborate interplay
between what Laub and Lauritsen refer to as the result of interactions
between individual development and social contexts (1998: 128). Thus,
youngsters with a low self-concept may engage in vandalism and violence
in order to exact revenge upon those whom they see as neglecting  or,
perhaps, precipitating  their needs. Even so, antisocial and other behaviours
can be acquired in a relatively elementary manner; for example,
through observational learning.


<b>LEARNING BY OBSERVING</b>


Observational learning is a process through which individuals imitate 
intentionally or otherwise  the behaviour of those they observe (that is,
models). A plenitude of potential models is readily available (for example,
family members, peers, celebrities) from whom individuals can learn

[p. <i>185</i>]

Utilizing real-life and filmed models, laboratory research  chiefly in
the United States  has demonstrated the particular conditions which
encourage observers to imitate (or otherwise) observed behaviour (for
example, Bandura and Walters, 1963). More latterly, research of this kind
has tended to focus upon television programme content and its influence
upon viewers.


<b>REAL OR ELUSIVE LINKS?</b>


Since television's availability, arguments have raged about whether television
viewing  and violence viewing, in particular  incites viewers to
behave antisocially. Some have found that youngsters became more antisocial
after exposure to media violence (for example, Williams, 1986;
Huesmann et al., 2003; Boyatzis et al., 1995). Others have failed to replicate
these findings (for example, Weigman et al., 1992; Gunter et al., 2000),
and some have claimed that television violence viewing can lessen viewers'
aggression (for example, Berkowitz and Rawlings, 1963). Elsewhere,
Huesmann and colleagues (2003) have contended that substantial evidence
exists that media violence is a long-term predisposing and short-term
precipitating factor (2003: 201), whilst Gauntlett (1997) has expressed
doubts about the existence of any such links.


More refined conceptual models have also emerged (Berkowitz and
Heimer, 1989), where the viewer is seen as 'playing a cognitively more
active role in the context of media content interpretation and choice of
response to media stimuli (Gunter et al., 2000: 66). Another viewpoint on
these seemingly elusive links makes an important distinction between
the <i>learning</i> and <i>practising</i> of antisocial behaviours. So, environmental
controls  or the lack of them  are largely responsible for permitting or
prohibiting the practising of behaviours acquired through observational
learning. Thus:


... where environments actively check on and correct children's behaviour,
television's capacity to adversely affect young viewers' social behaviour is
lessened or removed, in general. (Charlton et al., 2002: 131)


The non-practising of learned aggression may stem from a variety of
sources, including a fear of rebuke or other punishment, a sensitivity to
being watched over and  with some older individuals  a well-developed
value system.

<b>MEDIATING LINKS BETWEEN TELEVISION</b>


<b>AND VIEWERS' BEHAVIOUR</b>


Potential links between television viewing and viewers' behaviour are
complex, and can be mediated by a range of factors including the amount
and type of television viewed, how television programme content is perceived
(that is, as fact or fiction) and the degree to which viewers identify
with television characters. A further factor concerns the extent to which
healthy control is exercised over young viewers' social behaviour
together with their television viewing.


<b>Identification with television characters</b>


According to Hake (2001), the identification process is about relations
between the viewer and a media character whereupon the viewer wishes
that he or she was like that person. The identification drive is a simplistic
one. It's about the pursuit of desired attributes or qualities (for example, attitudes,
dress, values, speech and actions). However, whilst the identification
process can promote good behaviour, antisocial behaviours can be acquired,
too. Whilst earliest identifications usually involve parents, the absence of
appealing models at home can encourage young viewers to look elsewhere.
Merlo-Flores, for example, talked about the screen magically solving
the situation by presenting heroes who never die, who everybody knows
and accepts (1998: 175).


There is evidence that the identification process is associated with the
amount  and types  of viewing undertaken. Whilst some characters, for
instance, can foster altruistic behaviour, the influence of others is less
pleasing. For example, children (mostly boys) who identify with aggressive
television characters tend to be heavy television violence viewers
(Huesmann et al., 1984). Even so, the differentiation between desirable
and less desirable models is not simplistic for:


Good characters frequently are the perpetrators of aggression on TV. A full 40
per cent of the violent incidents are initiated by characters who have good qualities
that make them attractive role models to viewers. Not only are attractive
characters often violent, but physical aggression is frequently condoned.
(Wilson et al., 1998: 71)


<b>Perceptions of content realism</b>


Reeves (1978) claimed that television effects can be understood better by
attending to viewers' perceptions of content realism. The reasons why
these perceptions are considered important derive:

[p. <i>187</i>]

... from convictions that realistic portrayals of vicariously reinforced behaviour
have greater instructional potential for performing vicarious, aggressive
sequences ... because the expected likelihood of actually achieving rewards or
avoiding punishment can be more accurately assessed. (Atkin, 1984: 615)


This thinking has been reinforced by empirical research. For example,
children were found to respond more aggressively to television aggression
when they were informed the programming was real, compared to those
told the programming was fictional (Feshbach, 1976). Likewise,
Hapkirwitz and Stone (1974) reported that non-realistic programmes had
less impact than realistic ones, and in Atkin's (1984) study viewers
became more aggressive when violent incidents were presented as realistic
news rather than fantasy. Last but not least, from a meta-analysis of
over 200 studies, Hearold (1986) concluded that the degree of realism in
television programmes was a major variable affecting the amount of antisocial
behaviour practised by viewers.


Cognitive development plays a weighty role in children's ability to differentiate
between reality and unreality. Thus, younger viewers seem
more vulnerable to untoward viewing outcomes (van Evra, 1998;
Chandler, 1997). For example, UK primary school children were often
unsure about the realism of television characters attending a fictional secondary
school <i>Grange Hill</i>. They tended to use the programme's content
about what to expect once they (themselves) transferred to secondary
school, whereas secondary school children were often critical of the
<i>Grange Hill</i> story lines, as their own real-life experience had taught them
that they wrongly portrayed secondary school life (Gunter et al., 1991).


<b>Social control and social capital</b>


More recently, the term social control has permeated the television effects'
debate. Laub and Lauritsen construed the term being about community
norms regarding acceptable and unacceptable behaviour (1998: 138).
Lacking these controls, youngsters can feel free to misbehave with little fear
of retribution. A related term is social capital, which refers to the extent to
which individuals have others to rely upon for assistance and support. Thus:


... in terms of family management, increased social capital means residents
share information about children and others in the neighbourhood, thereby
establishing community norms regarding acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
(Laub and Lauritsen, 1998: 138)


Moreover, Cattell talked about it as a resource produced when people
cooperate for mutual benefit (2001: 1052).


Some young viewers become vulnerable to untoward television viewing
effects due to deficient social controls. They include those from homes

[p. <i>188</i>]

The erosion of the traditional family has left many children separated
from watchful and careful eyes of grandparents, aunts and uncles, for
example (Amato and Booth, 2001). Fontana reflected upon the extended
family of past times who:


... tended to live near each other, and the child often saw as much of other
relatives as he did of his own parents, with the result that he was subject to a
broad range of influence. This influence is sometimes seen by modern sociologists
as being all to the good in that it engendered more of a sense of community
into a neighbourhood and provided checks upon antisocial behaviour
in the young. (1981: 44)


This loss is worrying, given that an increasing number of children are
replacing the extended family with the television set (Singer and Singer,
1986).


<b>Amount and type of viewing</b>


Singer and Singer claimed that the amount and type of viewing is an important
predictor of behaviour, arguing that heavy viewing places the child at
serious risk of greater restlessness and more aggression, all contributory to
poor behavioural adjustment when the child is beginning at school (1986:
88). Huesmann and colleagues have also stressed the increased risk of

[p. <i>189</i>]

<b>BLUEPRINT FOR THE</b>


<b>VULNERABLE VIEWER</b>


Although the television effects' debate rages, laboratory research has
yielded persuasive evidence that television viewing <i>can</i> adversely affect
viewers' behaviour, although personal and social/contextual factors
assume a key role in determining whether untoward outcomes become
manifest. Accordingly, the research outcomes referred to in earlier pages
suggest the following profile for those at risk of becoming vulnerable
viewers. Those:


 who identify with aggressive characters;


 with difficulty differentiating between real and fictional characters;


 who are heavy viewers, especially of television violence;


 whose viewing is unsupervised; and


 whose social behaviour is largely unchecked.


<b>THE VULNERABLE VIEWER AND</b>


<b>CHILDREN WITH EMOTIONALAND</b>


<b>BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS</b>


Huesmann and colleagues' (2003) claim that the television effects' debate
is settled appears both untimely and reckless. The literature remains
bedevilled by dissension. Yet, there may be a plausible explanation for the
lack of consensus, one to do with context. Charlton et al. (1998) suggested
that youngsters' antisocial behaviour could be discouraged where responsible
supervision is available, whereas the likelihood of antisocial behaviour
occurring is heightened by its absence. Many children with emotional
and behaviour difficulties grow up adversely affected by deviant families,
deviant peer groups, socio-economic inequality, poverty, high population

[p. <i>190</i>]

 heavy television use;


 heavy viewing of television violence;


 confusion between reality and fantasy;


 identification with aggressive characters; and


 a lack of guardianship behaviour over their viewing, and social
behaviour, in general.


Thus, many youngsters evidencing emotional and behavioural difficulties
become exceptionally vulnerable viewers not only in the sense that
they are exceptional children, but also because their environments
together with their viewing habits heighten their vulnerability to adverse
viewing effects. The nature of the overt and covert problems of vulnerable
and exceptionally vulnerable viewers suggests some similarity in the
resolutions required to ameliorate them.


<b>LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS</b>


Arguably, central to the predicament of many vulnerable young viewers,
and others with emotional and behavioural problems, is the dwindling
amounts of both healthy attention and sensible support made available by
families, individuals and the wider community. This parsimony includes
a widespread laxity in checking and steering youngsters' social behaviour
in ways that help them to sustain healthy relationships and function
responsibly within families, neighbourhoods and communities. Lacking
this care and guidance, youngsters can learn antisocial behaviours from
their viewing (and elsewhere) and freely practise them, for checks upon
their social behaviour are uncommon. In contexts like these, given that
antisocial behaviour frequently attracts neither contingent rebuke nor
healthy suggestions for alternative desirable behaviour, the (mis)- behaver
can readily construe that such behaviour is condoned.


A plenitude of plausible solutions exists to help vulnerable viewers; some
tried, others not. They include the watershed (that is, in the United
Kingdom, only material suitable for family viewing can be broadcast before
21.00 hrs), the V-chip technology, electronic programme guides (EPGs) as
well as in-school interventions (see Sprafkin et al., 1992). Arguably, a more
practicable solution (with implications for youngsters with severe behaviour

[p. <i>191</i>]

<b>A FOCUS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH</b>


The television effects' debate persists, unabated. Even so, laboratory
studies  which are well placed to analyse the processes through which television
can affect viewers  have demonstrated that viewing aggression,
for example, can make viewers behave more aggressively. Moreover, differential
conditions were shown to encourage or discourage the practising
(yet not the learning) of this aggression. A highly influential condition
was found to be the context. Some contexts provoked aggressive behaviour,
others prevented it. Arguably, however, the tendency for media research
to be overly focused upon the television has been at the expense of context.
Clearly, the television is a risk factor in terms of abetting antisocial
behaviour, but no more.


If context matters in the laboratory, it should matter also in real life
(that is, in the naturalistic setting). Thus, conflicting findings from naturalistic
research may well, on occasions, reflect differential contexts (for
example, Williams, 1986; Charlton et al., 2002). Deviant families and
peer groups, families under stress, poor parenting and broken communities
can all too easily bring about problem behaviour. On the other hand,
a supportive context which helps children to become better parents, more
responsible citizens and more effective contributors to their community
offers more pragmatic ways for limiting pernicious outcomes from television
viewing (and from other risky environmental influences).


Contexts should be considered more earnestly in quests to add to an
understanding of the role that television plays in creating problem behaviours,
and ways in which such problems can be prevented, resolved or
minimized. Even so, such thinking remains speculative until a body of
