<b>Incidents and Characteristics of Abuse</b>

Sexual abuse involves any sexual activity
with a child where consent is not or cannot
be given (Berliner, 2000; Finkelhor, 1979).
This includes sexual contact that is accomplished
by force or threat of force, regardless
of the age of the participants, and all sexual
contact between an adult and a child, regardless
of whether there is deception or the
child understands the sexual nature of the
activity. Sexual contact between an older
and a younger child also can be abusive if
there is a significant disparity in age, development,
or size, rendering the younger child
incapable of giving informed consent. The
sexually abusive acts may include sexual
penetration, sexual touching, or noncontact
sexual acts such as exposure or voyeurism.


All states have laws prohibiting sexual
abuse of children (Myers, 1998). Each state
individually defines and labels prohibited
activities, and thus criminal statutes vary
from state to state. Child abuse statutes usually
define sexually abusive behavior quite
broadly but sometimes extend jurisdiction
only to acts committed by caretakers. States
identify an age that an individual can consent
to sexual contact, usually between 14
and 18 years. Sexual contact between an
adult and a minor under the age of consent
is illegal. In addition, incest is generally illegal
regardless of age or consent. Criminal
statutes also apply to teenagers. Even younger
children can be prosecuted for sexual
abuse, but it must be established that the offending
child was capable of forming the intent
to commit a crime.

<b>Rates of Sexual Abuse</b>


The precise incidence and prevalence of
sexual abuse in the general population
are not known. It is difficult to establish
incidence rates because most sexual abuse is
not reported at the time it occurs (e.g.,
Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, &amp; Smith, 1990).
In addition, it is impossible to know exactly
how many cases of sexual abuse are reported
on an annual basis nationwide. Because
there is no national reporting system
for crimes against children, official crime
and child abuse statistics tend to be unreliable.
Child abuse figures vary by state definitions
and sometimes do not include sexual
abuse committed by nonfamily members.
Currently, the best mechanism for determining
the scope of child sexual abuse is
through retrospective surveys of adult
nonclinical populations. Such surveys show
considerable variability that can be best explained
by differences in research methodology.
The population surveyed, survey
method, type and number of screening
questions, and definitions of sexual abuse all
influence the reported figures of abuse
(Finkelhor, 1994).


Finkelor (1994) reviewed the various retrospective
prevalence surveys with adults
conducted in the United States and Canada
and concluded that at least 20% to 25% of
women and from 5% to 15% of men experience
contact sexual abuse. Most studies of
the impact of sexual abuse on adult populations
find similar percentages. Two surveys
of nationally representative samples of adolescents
have been conducted that inquired
about sexual and physical assault experiences
(Finkelhor &amp; Dziuba-Leatherman,
1994; Kilpatrick &amp; Saunders, 1999). In these
studies, relatively lower rates of sexual
abuse were reported, but because the children
were not yet 18, there was still an opportunity
for victimization to occur. In addition,
very few of these children reported
intrafamilial abuse. It is quite possible that
the research method of telephone interviews
in which parents had to give the consent for
children to participate inhibited them from
reporting certain kinds of experiences.


Recent research on the impact of trauma
on memory suggests that estimates of abuse
rates based on self-report of adults may underestimate
its prevalence. Two prospective
longitudinal studies of adults with documented
childhood sexual abuse histories
found that more than 30% of the respondents
did not report those early experiences
Aspects of Child Maltreatment
when questioned (Widom &amp; Morris, 1997;
Williams, 1994). Although some of the
nonreporting may be due to a reluctance to
reveal remembered abuse, Williams's
(1994) analysis of the responses of women
who did not report documented abuse cases
strongly suggests that they did not recall
what had happened, given that more than
half of these subjects reported <i>other</i> sexually
abusive experiences in childhood.


Reporting of sexual abuse increased significantly
in the late 1980s and the early
1990s. In recent years, however, there has
been a substantial decline in reports to child
abuse authorities (Jones &amp; Finkelhor, 2001).
A majority of states have seen decreases of
up to 30% since 1994. The reasons for this
change are unclear but may be the result of
actual declines in the rate of sexual abuse or
changes in policies and practices with regard
to screening reports. Regarding the former,
crime rates in general have been declining,
and this trend may also be reflected in sexual
abuse cases, or prevention efforts may
have had an effect. Alternatively, given that
"reported" cases reflect the number that has
been accepted for investigation, the decrease
in reported rates may reflect more stringent
criteria applied to accepting cases for investigation.


<b>Characteristics of<br />
Sexual Abuse Experiences</b>


The reported characteristics of sexual
abuse vary depending on the data source.
For example, child abuse reporting systems
and clinical programs tend to overrepresent
intrafamilial cases. Based on general population
surveys (e.g., Finkelhor, 1994;
Saunders, Kilpatrick, Hanson, Resnick, &amp;
Walker, 1999), abuse by parent figures (parents
and stepparents) constitutes between
6% and 16% of all cases, and abuse by any
relative comprises more than one third of
cases. In these nonclinical samples, teenagers
represent up to 40% of offenders, and
strangers account for a relatively small proportion
(5%-15%), with the remainder of
cases involving individuals known to the
child or family. In clinical samples, parent
figures comprise between a quarter and a
third of the offenders and all relatives about
one half (e.g., Elliott &amp; Briere, 1994;
Gomes-Schwartz, Horowitz, &amp; Cardarelli,
1990; Ruggiero, McLeer, &amp; Dixon, 2000). In
both clinical and nonclinical samples, the

[p. <i>57</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00071&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Multiple abuse episodes of sexual abuse
are very common, occurring in up to half
of the cases in nonclinical samples (e.g.,
Saunders et al., 1999) and in up to three
fourths of children in clinical samples
(Conte &amp; Schuerman, 1987; Elliott &amp; Briere,
1994; Ruggiero et al., 2000). Completed or
attempted oral, anal, or vaginal penetration
occurs in about one fourth of non-clinical
subjects (Finkelhor, 1994) and in
half or more of clinical samples (Elliott &amp;
Briere, 1994; Gomes-Schwartz et al., 1990;
Ruggiero et al., 2000). The mean age for
sexual abuse is approximately 9 years old,
with a range from infancy to 17 years.


In clinical samples, both sex and race are
associated with some differences in abuse
experiences and circumstances. Compared
with girls, boys are older at onset of victimization,
more likely to be abused by non-family
members, and more likely to be
abused by women and by offenders who are
known to have abused other children (e.g.,
Faller, 1989a, 1989b; Holmes &amp; Slap, 1998).
In the few available studies specifically examining
ethnicity, differences in the type
and length of abuse experience, offender relationship,
family characteristics, and family
response are associated with ethnic back-ground
(Huston, Parra, Prihoda, &amp; Foulds,
1995; Mennen, 1995; Rao, DiClemente, &amp;
Ponton, 1992; Sanders-Phillips, Moisan,
Wadlington, Morgan, &amp; English, 1995). It is
not entirely clear what accounts for these
ethnic variations. They may be the result of
reporting bias, differences in family configurations
or cultural practices, or simply an artifact
of the samples in these studies
Nonclinical African American and Caucasian
women have similar rates of child sexual
abuse (Wyatt, 1985). The rates for Asian
women are somewhat lower, and Hispanic
women are at increased risk for incestuous
abuse (Russell, 1984).


Families with a child who has been sexually
abused are thought to have certain characteristics.
Empirical studies have found
that families of both incest and nonincest
sexual abuse victims are reported as less cohesive,
more disorganized, and generally
more dysfunctional than families of nonabused
individuals (Elliott, 1994; Hoag-wood
&amp; Stewart, 1989; Madonna, Van
Scoyk, &amp; Jones, 1991; Mannarino &amp; Cohen,
1996a, 1996b). The areas most often identified
as problematic in incest cases are problems
with communication, a lack of emotional
closeness and flexibility, and social
isolation (e.g., Dadds, Smith, Weber, &amp; Robinson,
1991). Although it appears that families
in which incest has occurred do exhibit
greater dysfunction, it is possible that the pathology
is at least as much a result of the incest
as the cause (Briere, 2000a; Briere &amp;
Elliott, 1993).


Some risk factors for sexual abuse have
been identified. Girls are at higher risk for
sexual abuse than boys. Both males and females
are at increased risk if they have lived
without one of their natural parents, have a
mother who is unavailable, or perceive their
family life as unhappy (Finkelhor &amp; Baron,
1986a, 1986b; Finkelhor et al., 1990;
Holmes &amp; Slap, 1998). There is speculation
that children who have a psychological or
cognitive vulnerability also may be at in
creased risk for sexual abuse (e.g.,
Tharinger, Horton, &amp; Millea, 1990). The reported
incidence of sexual abuse among
children with a disability is 1.75 times the
rate for children with no disability (National

[p. <i>58</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00072&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexual abuse is accomplished in a variety
of ways. In some cases, even though the offender
has a relationship with the child, the
victimization occurs without warning. More
typically, offenders engage in a gradual process
of sexualizing the relationship over time
(Berliner &amp; Conte, 1990). Offenders may
conceal the sexual nature of the activity by
characterizing it as nonsexual (e.g., sex education,
hygiene) or may encourage the child
to consider the relationship as mutual. Repeat
offenders generally calculate and plan
their approach to victimizing children, often
employing elaborate strategies to involve
the children, maintain their cooperation,
and prevent reporting (Conte, Wolfe, &amp;
Smith, 1989; Elliott, Browne, &amp; Kilcoyne,
1995; Lang &amp; Frenzel, 1988). In a substantial
percentage of cases, offenders use force,
threaten the child, or induce fear of injury or
death (e.g., Elliott &amp; Briere, 1994; Gomes-Schwartz
et al., 1990; Saunders et al., 1999).
In other cases, the offender employs emotional
coercion, offers tangible rewards, or
misuses adult authority.


<b>Disclosing and<br />
Reporting Sexual Abuse</b>


Most sexual abuse is neither revealed immediately
nor reported to authorities subsequent
to disclosure. Studies of clinical and
nonclinical populations of adults reveal that
fewer than half of victims tell anyone at the
time of the abuse, and a large percentage
never reveal the victimization until asked for
research purposes (Finkelhor et al., 1990;
Smith, Elstein, Trost, &amp; Bulkley, 1993). For
example, Finkelhor et al. (1990) found that
only about 40% of men and women had disclosed
the abuse at the time it occurred, 24%
of women and 14% of men told at a later
time, and 33% of women and 42% of men
had never told until the time of data collection.
Similarly, Elliott (1993) found that
among professional women who were
abused as children, immediate disclosures
occurred in only 20% of the cases, whereas
40% of the sample had not revealed the
abuse until completing the survey. In retrospective
studies, only 6% to 12% of cases are
reported to authorities (Elliott, 1993; Russell,
1984; Saunders et al., 1999).


Underreporting may be related to the nature
of the acts, not just to the fact that the
victims are children. In general, crimes
against children are less likely to be reported
to the criminal justice system than crimes
against adults even when they are comparably
serious in nature (Finkelhor, Wolack, &amp;
Berliner, 2001). However, the National
Crime Victimization Survey, which includes
children older than 12 years, found that although
sexual assault was reported at the
lowest rate of all crimes, the rate for adolescents
was equivalent to that of adults, about
30% of acknowledged sexual assaults
(Finkelhor &amp; Olmrod, 2000).


Research conducted in clinical and forensic
samples of children similarly suggests
that there is typically a delay in disclosure.
For example, Gomes-Schwartz et al. (1990)
found that only 24% of victims reported
within a week of the last episode, and some
waited years. Many times the victimization
comes to light because of an unintentional
report from the child. Sometimes, for example,
children confide in a friend without intending
an official report. Abuse may also be
uncovered because of suspicious behaviors
or statements, medical findings of injury or
infection, or because a witness interrupted
the abuse, pornographic pictures were
found, or an offender confessed.


When children do disclose, they are most
likely to tell a parent, usually their mother
(Sauzier, 1989). Overall, in 45% to 75% of
all cases that come to the attention of authorities,
the precipitating event is something
other than the child's report of abuse
(Elliott &amp; Briere, 1995; Sauzier, 1989;
Sorensen &amp; Snow, 1991). It has been noted
that even when children who have been
abused are questioned directly, some may
deny the abuse initially. Following an initial
report, some children recant. Summit (1983,
1994) described a child sexual abuse accommodation
syndrome (CSAAS) that consists
of several dynamics that can affect children's
ability to reveal their abuse. These
dynamics (secrecy, helplessness, entrapment,
and accommodation) can lead to delayed,
unconvincing disclosure or retraction.
In a study of children with sexually
transmitted diseases, 43% did not acknowledge
sexual contact when interviewed (Lawson
&amp; Chaffin, 1992), although eventually
most children did reveal abuse. Similarly,

[p. <i>59</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00073&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although children sometimes do not report
actual abuse when asked, it has been
demonstrated in samples of children and
adult women in treatment settings that they
are more likely to report abuse if they are directly
asked. A study of child outpatients
showed a marked increase in the reported
rate of sexual abuse (from 6%-31%) when
the children were asked specifically about a
possible abuse history (Lanktree, Briere, &amp;
Zaidi, 1991). Similarly, Briere and Zaidi
(1989) found that the rate of sexual abuse
history in adult female psychiatric emergency
room patients increased from 6% to
70% after clinicians were instructed to
screen for sexual abuse.

<b>Effects of Sexual Abuse</b>

Research conducted over the past two decades
indicates that a wide range of psychological
and interpersonal problems are more
prevalent among those who have been sexually
abused than among individuals with no
such experiences (e.g., Wolfe &amp; Birt, 1995).
Because most studies are retrospective, a definitive
causal relationship between such difficulties
and sexual abuse cannot usually be
established. In a prospective, longitudinal,
general population study, however, Boney-McCoy
and Finkelhor (1996) found that
sexual abuse was associated with posttraumatic
stress and depression. Boney- McCoy
and Finkelhor controlled for prior
symptoms and parent-child relationships.
The aggregate of consistent findings in this
literature has led many researchers and clinicians
to conclude that childhood sexual
abuse is a significant risk factor for a variety
of problems, both in the short term (e.g.,
Beitchman, Zucker, Hood, da Costa, &amp;
Akman, 1991; Kendall-Tackett, Williams, &amp;
Finkelhor, 1993) and in terms of later adult
functioning (e.g., Beitchman et al., 1992;
Fergusson, Horwood, &amp; Lynskey, 1996;
Mullen, Martin, Anderson, &amp; Romans,
1994).


When sexual abuse causes harm, the
harm can be attributed to the fact that sexual
abuse is nonconsensual, is frequently developmentally
inappropriate, and invariably
alters the nature of the relationship within
which it occurs. Sexual abuse can be painful,
frightening, shame inducing, and confusing
and can lead to responses in childhood that
interfere with normal developmental processes
and increase the risk for subsequent
maladjustment in adult life.


<b>Effects on Children</b>


A body of empirical literature specifically
describing the effects of sexual abuse on
child victims has now accumulated. Unlike
studies of adults that have been conducted
with nonclinical as well as clinical samples,
with few exceptions, information on children
is derived from clinical samples, virtually
all of which have some involvement
with child protection or criminal justice authorities.
Thus, what is discussed below regarding
the effects of sexual abuse on children
is based primarily on clinical data.
Consistent with the clinical data, however,
studies of nonclinical samples of teenagers
find that victims of sexual abuse report
higher rates of emotional and behavioral
problems than their nonabused peers
(Boney-McCoy &amp; Finkelhor, 1995; Hibbard,
Ingersoll, &amp; Orr, 1990; Kilpatrick &amp;
Saunders, 1999).


<i>Emotional distress and dysfunction</i>. As a
group, sexually abused children do not always
self-report clinically significant levels
of emotional distress. Most studies find,
however, that they have more depressive
symptoms and more anxiety or lower self-esteem
than nonabused comparison children
(Boney-McCoy &amp; Finkelhor, 1995;
Gidycz &amp; Koss, 1989; McLeer et al., 1998;
Mannarino &amp; Cohen, 1996a, 1996b; Stern,
Lynch, Oates, O'Toole, &amp; Cooney, 1995).
Emotional disturbance has been found on
personality tests (e.g., Basta &amp; Peterson,
1990; German, Habernicht, &amp; Furcher
1990) and projective measures (Stovall &amp;

[p. <i>60</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00074&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sexually abused children in treatment
settings, compared with their nonabused
clinical cohorts, tend to have different kinds
of problems. For example, they have been
found to be more likely than their nonabused
peers to be diagnosed with depression,
exhibit suicidal behavior (Lanktree
et al., 1991), have lower self-esteem
(Cavaiola &amp; Schiff, 1989; Wozencraft, Wagner,
&amp; Pellegrin, 1991), and have greater
symptoms of anxiety (Kolko, Moser, &amp;
Weldy, 1988). When sexually abused girls
from dysfunctional families are compared
with nonabused girls from similarly disturbed
families, the abused girls have lower
self-esteem, more internalized aggression,
and poorer relationships with their mothers
(Hotte &amp; Rafman, 1992).


<i>Post-trauma effects</i>. Trauma-specific symptoms
are those associated with the diagnosis
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994)
and include reexperiencing, avoidance
numbing, and hyperarousal. Sexually
abused children consistently report higher
levels of these symptoms in both nonclinical
and clinical samples (Boney-McCoy &amp;
Finkelhor, 1995; Briere, 1996a, 1996b;
McLeer et al., 1998). More than one third of
children meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD
(Dubner &amp; Motta, 1999; Kilpatrick &amp;
Saunders, 1999; McLeer et al., 1988;
Ruggiero et al., 2000), and a majority exhibit
some of the symptoms (McLeer,
Deblinger, Henry, &amp; Orvaschel, 1992;
McLeer et al., 1998; Wolfe, Gentile, &amp;
Wolfe, 1989).


Sexually abused children appear more
likely than other maltreated children to receive
the diagnosis of PTSD (Deblinger,
McLeer, Atkins, Ralphe, &amp; Foa, 1989;
Dubner &amp; Motta, 1999).


<i>Behavioral problems</i>. On standard measures
of child behavioral problems, sexually
abused children are reported by their parents
to have more behavioral problems than
nonabused children, although the problems
do not always reach clinically significant levels
(e.g., Gomes-Schwartz et al., 1990;
Mannarino &amp; Cohen, 1996a, 1996b; Stern
et al., 1995). Maternal distress and lack of
support for the child appear to be associated
with reporting higher levels of child behavior
problems (Everson, Hunter, Runyan,
Edelsohn, &amp; Coulter, 1989; Wind &amp; Silvern,
1992). Adolescents who have been sexually
abused are more likely than nonvictims to
run away from home, use drugs, and be
bulimic (Hibbard et al., 1990); report having
trouble with a teacher (Boney-McCoy &amp;
Finkelhor, 1995); and have substance abuse
disorders (Kilpatrick &amp; Saunders, 1999).
Teenage mothers with a history of sexual
abuse are more likely to abuse their children
or have them taken away by child protective
services (Boyer &amp; Fine, 1991).


A specific effect of sexual abuse is increased
sexual behavior. Samples of sexually
abused children are consistently reported
to have more sexual behavior
problems than samples of nonabused children
(e.g., Friedrich et al., 2001; Mannarino
&amp; Cohen, 1996a, 1996b). In addition, the increased
sexualized behavior appears more
specifically related to sexual abuse, with sexually
abused children reported to have more
sexual behavior than clinical comparisons
of neglected, physically abused, and psychiatrically
disturbed children (Adams,
McClellan, Douglass, McCurry, &amp; Storck,
1995; Cosentino, Meyer-Bahlburg, Alpert,
Weinberg, &amp; Gaines, 1995; Friedrich,
Jaworski, Huxsahl, &amp; Bengston, 1997; Kendall-Tackett
et al., 1993). Sexually abused children
tend to engage in more sexual behavior
that is associated with genital sexual activity,
such as mimicking intercourse and inserting
objects in the vagina or anus (Friedrich
et al., 2001). In older children, girls are more
likely to engage in hypersexual behavior,
whereas boys are more likely to engage in
genital exposure or sexual coercion, when
compared with nonabused children (Adams
et al., 1995). However, only a third of sexually
abused children exhibit sexual behavior
problems (Friedrich, 1993) and other
variables, including family nudity, exposure
to sexual activity, and family stressors,
increase sexual behavior in nonabused
children.


<i>Interpersonal consequences</i>. Sexually abused
children tend to be less socially competent
than nonabused children (Mannarino &amp; Cohen,
1996a, 1996b; Stern et al., 1995). As a
group, they perceive themselves as different
from others and tend to be less trusting of

[p. <i>61</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00075&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Cognitive difficulties and distortions</i>. Cognitive
functioning may be affected by sexual
abuse experiences. Einbender and Friedrich
(1989) reported greater cognitive impairment
in a sample of sexually abused girls,
and Rust and Troupe (1991) found sexually
abused children to have deficits in school
achievement.


Negative or distorted attributions and
perceptions have been frequently observed
clinically, but the rates at which these symptoms
occur in sexually abused children are
not well documented. Contrary to a common
clinical lore that self-blame is ubiquitous,
empirical studies find that most children
do not blame themselves for what
happened but rather hold offenders responsible
for the abuse (e.g., Hunter, Goodwin,
&amp; Wilson, 1992). There is evidence that sexually
abused children as a group tend to perceive
themselves as different from peers and
have heightened self-blame for negative
events and reduced interpersonal trust
(Mannarino et al., 1994). Guilt, self-blame,
shame, and negative attributional style,
when present, are associated with more severe
outcomes as discussed below.


<i>Course of symptoms</i>. The few available studies
that document children's symptoms over
time reveal a general pattern of improvement
for most children (e.g., Kendall-Tackett
et al., 1993). However, in a study
that followed children for 5 years following
abuse, there were no significant changes in
depression, self-esteem, or behavior problems;
approximately equal numbers of children
improved and deteriorated (Tebbutt,
Swanston, Oates, &amp; O'Toole, 1997). Overall,
between 10% and 24% of child victims
either do not improve or deteriorate (Berliner
&amp; Saunders, 1996; Kendall-Tackett
et al., 1993). Gomes-Schwartz et al. (1990)
found that abused children who were initially
least symptomatic had more problems at
18 months than did their initially more
highly symptomatic peers. Friedrich and
Reams (1987) noted in a series of case studies
that symptoms tended to fluctuate over
time rather than improve in linear fashion.
In a longitudinal study of children in
abuse-focused therapy, Lanktree and Briere
(1995) found that symptoms tended to subside
at differential rates. Anxiety and depression
abated fairly quickly; dissociation,
sexual concerns, and posttraumatic stress
took a longer time before significant attenuation
in distress was reported by children.
These data suggest that in many cases, even
with intervention, many children continue
to have significant symptomatology.


<b>Effects on Adults</b>


Sexual abuse appears to constitute a major
risk factor for a variety of problems in
adult life (Browne &amp; Finkelhor, 1986;
Finkelhor et al., 1990; Neumann, Houskamp,
Pollock, &amp; Briere, 1996; Polusny &amp;
Follette, 1996). The effects of abuse on adult
living are not uniform, however. Some survivors
report no or very few symptoms,
whereas others experience life as overwhelming
in many domains. Of the latter
group, those who seek treatment often present
with a complex array of difficulties and
concerns (e.g., Briere, Woo, McRae, Foltz, &amp;
Sitzman, 1997; Gladstone, Parker, Wilhelm,
Mitchell, &amp; Austin, 1999; Lombardo &amp; Pohl,
1997). Whether mild or severe, the symptoms
evidenced by adult survivors are an
extension of those found in children.


Although most studies find a relationship
between childhood sexual abuse and psychological
problems in adults, one recent
meta-analysis of the literature (Rind,
Tromovitch, &amp; Bauserman, 1998) concluded
that, among university students, this
relationship was very small or nonexistent
and could be accounted for by other, non-specific
family dysfunction. The authors
also suggested that the term <i>child sexual
abuse</i> should be rephrased as "adult-child
sex" (p. 45) to eliminate the "negative value
loadings" of the word <i>abuse</i>. Among the various
criticisms of this article are as follows
(a) its generalization from (relatively high-functioning)

[p. <i>62</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00076&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Research on the long-term effects of sexual
abuse has tended to focus on the
sequelae in women. Studies that include
males suggest that sexual abuse has lasting
impacts on adult adjustment for both genders,
although a number of studies find
more severe effects in females (e.g.,
Neumann et al., 1996; Rind et al., 1998).
Some of this sex difference may reflect a tendency
for males to cope with their abuse by
denying it or externalizing their distress
(e.g., increased anger and aggression toward
others) and a tendency for females to express
distress more directly and to employ
greater internalization in coping (e.g., M. P.
Mendel, 1995; S. Mendel, 1995; Rosen &amp;
Martin, 1998).


<i>Emotional distress</i>. As with sexually abused
children, adult survivors report more
dysphoria than do their nonabused peers.
Depression is the most frequently reported
symptom and has been documented in a variety
of clinical and nonclinical samples
(Briere &amp; Runtz, 1993; Browne &amp; Finkelhor,
1986; Polusny &amp; Follette, 1996).


Sexual abuse victims may have as much
as a fourfold greater lifetime risk for major
depression than do individuals with no
such abuse history (Stein, Golding, Siegel,
Burnam, . Sorenson, 1988). The pervasiveness
of depression among some survivors is
thought to be the cumulative effects of
chronic betrayal, disempowerment, feelings
of guilt and helplessness, and low self-esteem
(Finkelhor &amp; Browne, 1985; Peters,
1988). Thus, it should not be surprising that
increased suicidal behaviors have been
linked to sexual abuse. In two studies of out-patient
women, for example, patients with
an abuse history were twice as likely to have
attempted suicide as were their nonabused
peers (Briere &amp; Runtz, 1987; Briere &amp; Zaidi,
1989). In a community sample, approximately
16% of survivors had attempted suicide,
whereas less than 6% of their
nonabused cohorts had made a similar attempt
(Saunders, Villeponteaux, Lipovsky,
Kilpatrick, &amp; Veronen, 1992). A number of
other studies have demonstrated significant
relationships between childhood sexual
abuse and depression or depressive features
(e.g., Levitan, Parikh, Lesage, Hegadoren, &amp;
Adams, 1998; Weiss, Longhurst, &amp; Mazure,
1999).


Anxiety is a well-documented sequel of
sexual abuse (Gold, Lucenko, Elhai, Swingle,
&amp; Sellers, 1999; Lombardo &amp; Pohl,
1997). In the general population, survivors
are more likely than nonabused individuals
to meet the criteria for generalized anxiety
disorder, phobias, panic disorder, or obsessive-compulsive
disorder, with sexual abuse
survivors having up to 5 times a greater likelihood
of being diagnosed with at least one
anxiety disorder than their nonabused peers
(Saunders et al., 1992; Stein et al., 1988).
Adults with child abuse histories may manifest
their anxiety in multiple dimensions: (a)
cognitively (e.g., through excessive preoccupation
with and hypervigilance to danger)
(Briere, 2000b; Jehu, 1988; Wenninger &amp;
Ehlers, 1998), (b) with classically conditioned
responses (e.g., sexual dysfunction)
(Jarvis &amp; Copeland, 1997; McCabe &amp;
Cobain, 1998), and (c) somatically, as a natural
extension of sympathetic nervous system
hyperarousal (e.g., headaches, gastrointestinal
problems, back and pelvic pain, and
muscle tension) (Maynes &amp; Feinauer, 1994;
Salmon &amp; Calderbank, 1996; Springs &amp;
Friedrich, 1992).


In addition to chronic anxiety and depression,
problems with anger often are reported
by adult survivors of child sexual
abuse. Survivors frequently report chronic
irritability, unexpected feelings of rage, and
fear of their own anger (Briere &amp; Runtz,
1987; Lisak, 1993; Scott &amp; Day, 1996). Such
feelings can be expressed internally through
self-blame and self-injury (Briere &amp; Gil,
1998) or externally, resulting in the perpetration
of violence against others (Duncan &amp;
Williams, 1998). The rage experienced by
some survivors can intensify when it is restimulated
by interpersonal events reminiscent
of the original abuse scenario.


<i>Posttrauma effects</i>. Psychological distress
that occurs in reaction to a traumatic event
often manifests itself through (a) night-mares,

[p. <i>63</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00077&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Along with PTSD, dissociation appears
to be a common response to highly traumatic
events and often is seen in adult survivors
of sexual abuse (Chu &amp; Dill, 1990;
Elliott &amp; Briere, 1992; Zanarini, Ruser,
Frankenburg, Hennen, &amp; Gunderson,
2000). This relationship, however, is a complex
one and may include physical abuse effects
as well (Mulder, Beautrais, Joyce, &amp;
Fergusson, 1998). Dissociation is thought to
be the psyche's defense against the complete
awareness of abuse-related thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors (Kluft, 1985; Putnam,
1990). For victims of especially severe
abuse, the trauma may be overwhelming,
making it difficult for the survivor to fully
integrate the events cognitively and thus reinforcing
a mechanism that reduces complete
awareness of the trauma. The ability of
the survivor to dissociate abuse-specific
thoughts, affects, and memories allows for
the reduction of the acute and continuing
impacts of victimization by changing the
nature or extent of abuse-related pain
(Shengold, 1989).


Along with psychic numbing, depersonalization,
and disengagement, dissociation
may take the form of amnesia for the abuse.
According to <i>DSM-IV</i> (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994), amnesia refers to a
memory disturbance "characterized by an
inability to recall important personal information,
usually of a traumatic or stressful
nature, that is too extensive to be explained
by ordinary forgetfulness" (p. 478). Recent
research suggests that a substantial proportion
of sexual abuse survivors report partial
or complete loss of memory for their abuse
experience (Elliott &amp; Briere, 1995; Herman
&amp; Harvey, 1997; Williams, 1994). However,
not all memory loss is necessarily due to dissociation
(Berliner &amp; Briere, 1999; Lindsay
&amp; Briere, 1997). It appears that incomplete
or absent abuse-related memories may be
correlated with maltreatment that began at a
particularly early age, was long in duration,
or was chronic or violent in nature (Briere &amp;
Conte, 1993; Herman &amp; Schatzow, 1987).
Incomplete memories for abuse also may be
correlated with earlier abuse by a family
member (Williams, 1994).


Dissociation of memories superficially
may increase the survivor's level of behavioral
and psychological functioning by
numbing or partitioning off abuse-related affect
and recollections (Putnam, 1990; van
der Kolk &amp; Kadish, 1987) and thus may be a
valuable defense in the presence of acute
trauma. However, dissociation may also
have negative long-term consequences for
adaptive functioning later in life and ultimately
may decrease the survivor's capacity
for self-care and interfere with adaptive cognitive
processes (Briere, 1996a, 1996b,
1996c). Among sexual abuse survivors, for
example, the use of avoidant and suppressing
strategies as a means of coping with the
abuse has been associated with poorer adult
psychological adjustment (Leitenberg,
Greenwald, &amp; Cado, 1992).


<i>Cognitive distortions</i>. During childhood, internal
templates for adult assumptions
about self, others, and safety of the environment
are created (Cole &amp; Putnum, 1992).
Sexual abuse survivors often are raised in intrusive
and violent environments. As a result,
abuse-related cognitions are common
and reflect self-blame, low self-esteem, negative
self-attributes, a disbelief in self-efficacy,
and a perception of self as helpless and life
as dangerous or hopeless (Gold, 1986; Jehu,
1988). Such cognitive disturbance is
thought to arise from stigmatization associated
with responses to the abuse and the victim's
internalization of the assumptions regarding
self, the abuser, and society at large
(Finkelhor &amp; Browne, 1985).


Clinical writers have stressed the role of
the victim's need to make sense of his or her
abuse as supporting the development of cognitive

[p. <i>64</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00078&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<i>Externalized emotional distress</i>. Child abuse
can result in a constant challenge to the development
and implementation of coping
mechanisms because of the level of hyperarousal,
emotional pain, and restimulation
of abuse memories experienced by many
survivors. Thus, any external activity that
successfully reduces such internal tension
(e.g., through distraction, self-soothing, or
anesthesia) is reinforced. These activities include
self-mutilatory activities, such as cutting,
burning, or hitting oneself or pulling
out hair (Briere &amp; Gill, 1998; van der Kolk,
Perry, &amp; Herman, 1991; Walsh &amp; Rosen,
1988); using sexual activity during times of
intense negative abuse-related affect
(Becker, Rankin, &amp; Rickel, 1998; Briere,
1996a, 1996b, 1996c); bingeing and purging
to deal with feelings of emptiness (Piran,
Lerner, Garfinkel, Kennedy, &amp; Brouillette,
1988; Steiger &amp; Zanko, 1990); and alcohol
or substance abuse (Briere et al., 1997; Epstein,
Saunders, Kilpatrick, &amp; Resnick,
1998).


These patterns, although potential problems
for family members and therapists, are
often the survivor's attempt to reduce overwhelming
pain and reestablish a sense of internal
balance. They are activated most frequently
when feelings of anger, anxiety,
guilt, intrusion, isolation, or sadness overwhelm
the survivor's internal resources.
Subsequent to engaging in tension reduction
behaviors, survivors often report an initial
sense of escape, pleasure, relaxation, or
relief. This, however, may be followed by increased
feelings of guilt or self-loathing and
may precipitate a repeat of the tension reduction
behavior (Briere, 1996a, 1996b,
1996c).


<i>Interpersonal difficulties</i>. Given the emotional
distress, the tendency toward distorted
beliefs regarding self and others, the
intrusion and destabilization associated with
posttraumatic stress, and the often maladaptive
efforts to deal with such difficulties
experienced by many survivors, interpersonal
problems in adulthood are a predictable
sequel of childhood sexual abuse.
Because the victimization typically occurs in
the context of human relationships, sexual
abuse can cause a disruption in the normal
process of learning to trust, act autonomously,
and form stable, secure relationships
(Courtois, 1988; Elliott, 1994). Furthermore,
the violation and betrayal of
boundaries in the context of developing intimacy
can create interpersonal ambivalence
in many adult survivors.


As adults, female survivors report a
greater fear of both men and women (e.g.,
Briere &amp; Runtz, 1987). Females are more
likely to remain single, and once married,
they are more likely to divorce or separate
from their husbands than are nonabused
women (e.g., Russell, 1986). They report
having fewer friends (Gold, 1986), less satisfaction
in their relationships, greater discomfort
and sensitivity, and more
maladaptive interpersonal patterns (Bartoi
&amp; Kinder, 1998; DiLillo &amp; Long, 1999;
Elliott, 1994).


Of the interpersonal sequelae, perhaps
the most common complaint of sexual
abuse survivors is in the sexual domain.
This may take the form of sexual dysfunction
(Sarwer &amp; Durlak, 1996), sexual preoccupation
(Black &amp; DeBlassie, 1993), fantasies
of forced sexual contact (Gold, 1991),
or multiple brief, unsafe, or superficial sexual
or romantic relationships (Bartoi &amp;
Kinder, 1998; Bensley, Eenwyk, &amp;
Simmons, 2000; Johnsen &amp; Harlow, 1996).
Some women experience revictimization in
their adult lives (Messman &amp; Long, 1996;
Sorensen, Siegel, Golding, &amp; Stein, 1991).


<b>Mediating Factors</b>


Although the literature summarized earlier
is relatively unanimous with regard to
the potential negative psychological impacts
of childhood sexual abuse, such victimization
does not necessarily have an inevitable
or massive impact on victims. A careful examination

[p. <i>65</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00079&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Many studies have examined demographic
and abuse characteristics as predictors
of distress in children and reported surprisingly
inconsistent findings. Older
children tend to report more internalized
distress, whereas parents report more sexual
and nonsexual behavior problems in younger
children (e.g., Ruggiero et al., 2000;
Tebbutt et al., 1997; Wolfe, Sas, &amp; Wekerle,
1994). Boys appear to have more externalizing
problems than girls (Holmes &amp; Slap,
1998). These results may be an artifact of
the developmental stage and the manner of
expressing distress. More serious abuse, involving
penetration, longer duration or frequency,
closer relationship to offender, or
use of force, is sometimes but not always related
to outcome (Ruggiero et al., 2000;
Stern et al., 1995; Wolfe et al., 1994). The
relationships between these variables and
outcome appear to be more complex; different
characteristics are associated with different
outcomes, and some characteristics tend
to be correlated with each other (e.g., longer
duration with closer offender relationship).
For example, Spaccarelli (1995) found that
abuse seriousness (as indicated by type of
sexual acts and offender relationship) was
associated with depression but not anxiety,
aggression, or social problems, whereas
abuse stress (level of coerciveness, family
upset following abuse and nonsupportive
family reactions) was correlated only with
aggression. Attributional style and cognitive
appraisal are considered among the most
important factors in the development of
problems in sexually abused children
(Celano, 1992; Dalenberg &amp; Jacobs, 1994;
Fiering, Taska, &amp; Lewis, 1996; Spaccarelli,
1994). Consistent with evidence that older
children are more affected, higher levels of
cognitive functioning are also correlated
with greater distress (Shapiro, Leifer,
Martone, &amp; Kassem, 1992). This may be because
older children or those with more sophisticated
cognitive functioning are more
likely to focus on the implications of having
been abused. At least three types of attributions
are relevant to abuse outcome: general
attributional style, abuse-related attributions,
and abuse-specific attributions.


A negative general attributional style is
associated with poorer outcomes (Kress &amp;
Vandenberg, 1998; Mannarino &amp; Cohen,
1996a, 1996b; Wolfe et al., 1989), as are
negative appraisals for the abuse experience
(Spaccarelli &amp; Fuchs, 1997). As with nonabused
children, negative attributions are
primarily correlated with internalized distress.
Altered self and other perceptions that
are abuse related but not abuse specific are
also predictors of increased distress. Sexually
abused girls with higher levels of
shame have more depression and posttraumatic
stress symptoms, as well as lower
self-esteem (Fiering, Taska, &amp; Lewis, 1998).
Mannarino and Cohen (1996a, 1996b)
found that for sexually abused girls, feeling
different from their peers, perceiving themselves
to be less believed, and lacking interpersonal
trust were correlated with more
psychological distress over time. These relationships
were not found in normal controls
for whom general attributional style was a
more important predictor. Abuse-specific attributions
of self-blame or guilt have been

[p. <i>66</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00080&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Coping style is another relevant variable
in explaining differential outcomes (Spaccarelli,
1994). Victims who cope through wishful
thinking and tension reduction have
more internalized symptomatolgy (Johnson
&amp; Kenkel, 1991). Cognitive avoidance is associated
with depression and anxiety
(Spaccarelli &amp; Fuchs, 1997). On the other
hand, aggressive control is correlated with
aggression and social problems (Spaccarelli
&amp; Fuchs, 1997). An angry coping style is associated
with more behavior problems
(Chaffin, Wherry, &amp; Dykman, 1997). These
results suggest that either internalizing or
externalizing coping responses that are
overdetermined can lead to maladaptive
outcomes.


Family dysfunction not only may increase
the likelihood of intrafamilial sexual
abuse but also may exacerbate the effects of
abuse once it occurs (Alexander, 1992;
Courtois, 1988). Families of abused children
often have multiple additional problems, including
divorce, violence, psychiatric problems,
and substance abuse (Elliott &amp; Briere,
1994; Finkelhor &amp; Baron, 1986a, 1986b).
Families of sexually abused children have
poorer functioning compared with nonabused
controls (Mannarino &amp; Cohen,
1997; Stern et al., 1995). Abused children
are more distressed if their families have
characteristics of negative family functioning
(Conte &amp; Schuerman, 1987; Faust,
Runyon, &amp; Kenny, 1995; Friedrich, Beilke,
&amp; Urquiza, 1987; Mannarino &amp; Cohen,
1996a, 1996b; Tebbutt et al., 1997; Wind &amp;
Silvern, 1992). Maternal belief in the child's
report of sexual abuse and support following
the disclosure have a significant impact
on later functioning. Most parents believe
their children and take some protective action
(Conte &amp; Schuerman, 1987; Elliott &amp;
Briere, 1994; Gomes-Schwartz et al., 1990).
Research suggests that higher levels of maternal
support (Everson et al., 1989;
Gomes-Schwartz et al., 1990; Leifer,
Shapiro, &amp; Kassem, 1993; Runyan, Hunter,
&amp; Everson, 1992; Spaccarelli &amp; Fuchs, 1997)
or the availability of a supportive relationship
with another adult (Conte &amp; Schuerman,
1987) are associated with decreased
psychological distress and behavior problems.


In general, the closer the relationship of
the offender to the mother, the more likely
that support will be compromised. The
highest risk of failure to support is found
when the offender is a stepfather or the
mother's live-in boyfriend (Elliott &amp; Briere,
1994; Gomes-Schwartz et al., 1990). In incest
cases, mothers are more likely to believe
if the child is younger and has not also been
physically abused and when the offender
does not have a history of alcohol abuse
(Sirles &amp; Franke, 1989). Similarly, in combined
incest and nonincest cases, lack of maternal
support was predicted by physical
abuse or neglect of the victim, spousal
abuse, and substance abuse of the caretaker
(Elliott &amp; Briere, 1994).


Lack of maternal support also is associated
with the impact of intervention. The
most important variable predicting out-of-home
placement is whether the mother believes
and supports the child (Hunter, Coulter,
Runyan, &amp; Everson, 1990). Children
who lack maternal support are more likely
to recant the original allegation of abuse or
refuse to report it, even in the face of clear
evidence that the abuse occurred (Elliott &amp;
Briere, 1994; Lawson &amp; Chaffin, 1992).
Finally, maternal support is related to the
impact of criminal court testimony on the
abused child (Goodman et al., 1992;
Whitcomb et al., 1991).


The various activities associated with
professional intervention may affect the
level of psychological distress. The most
consistent finding is that multiple investigative
interviews appear to increase symptoms
(Berliner &amp; Conte, 1995; Henry, 1997;
Tedesco &amp; Schell, 1987). Placement or separation
per se is not always distressing (Berliner
&amp; Conte, 1995; Henry, 1997). The increased
symptomatology noted in children
who are taken into protective custody may
be secondary to the lack of caretaker support
that provoked placement (Runyan,
Everson, Edelsohn, Hunter, &amp; Coulter,
1988). Testifying in juvenile court has not
been found to increase distress in child victims
(Runyan et al., 1988). A small number
of studies indicate that testimony in criminal
court is associated with increased distress
only when it occurs more than once or when
cross-examination is lengthy and harsh
(Goodman et al., 1992; Whitcomb et al.,
1991). In studies, the outcome of the case
or whether the children received psychotherapy

[p. <i>67</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00081&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<b>Treatment Issues</b>

<b>Clinical Assessment</b>


Children who have been sexually abused
may exhibit both abuse-specific and general
psychopathology. The disorder that occurs
at the highest rates is PTSD, and the most
specific behavior problems are sexual behaviors.
These findings suggest that to capture
the impact of abuse experiences, it is especially
important to use abuse-specific
assessment measures. Several standardized
self-report checklists are commercially available
to assess trauma symptoms in children
and adults (Briere, 1997). Parent report
checklists are available for sexual behavior
(Friedrich, 1997) and trauma symptoms in
children (Briere, 1996c). Assessment of
attributional style, abuse-related and abuse-specific
attributions, and coping styles is
clinically relevant because these variables
are associated with outcome and are potentially
subject to alteration in treatment.
Abuse-specific measures are increasingly
available for assessing impact in adults (e.g.,
Briere, 1995). For children, clinical assessment
should address the family context.
Abuse-specific concerns such as level of support
and maternal distress, as well as more
general aspects of family functioning, have a
direct impact on child functioning and may
need to be a focus of clinical intervention.


<b>Treatment for Children</b>


Treatment approaches for sexually
abused children have been extensively described
in the clinical literature (e.g.,
Friedrich, 1992, 1995; Gil, 1991, James,
1989). There is also an accumulation of empirical
evaluations of interventions with sexually
abused and traumatized children. Reviews
of the extant treatment outcome
literature provide substantial evidence that
abuse-specific cognitive behavioral treatment
(CBT) is effective for posttraumatic
stress reactions (American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP],
1998; Cohen, Berliner, &amp; Mannarino, 2000;
Cohen, Berliner, &amp; March, 2000; Finkelhor
&amp; Berliner, 1995; Saywitz, Mannarino, Berliner,
&amp; Cohen, 2000).


Abuse-specific CBT consists of interventions
based on the principles of CBT that
have been proven effective for a variety of
conditions. Modifications of standard treatments
for anxiety, depression, and behavior
problems are applied to typical abuse reactions.
The importance of targeting abuse-related
perceptions and attributions derives
from studies showing that they are important
predictors for the course of symptoms
and for treatment outcome, especially with
school-age children (Cohen &amp; Mannarino,
2000; Mannarino &amp; Cohen, 1996a, 1996b).


The components of therapy include (a)
psychoeducation, (b) anxiety management,
(c) exposure, and (d) cognitive therapy (Cohen,
Berliner, &amp; Mannarino, 2000). Psychoeducation
involves providing information
about the nature of sexual abuse and offenders,
as well as the principles of CBT and
their application in therapy. Anxiety management
refers to teaching children to identify
emotional states and how to use various
relaxation and emotional and cognitive coping
strategies to reduce fearful and anxious
responses to abuse memories and reminders.
Gradual exposure via talking, drawing,
or writing about the abuse experience is designed
to decondition automatic negative
emotional associations and reduce maladaptive
avoidance. Cognitive therapy techniques
are used to challenge and replace
cognitive distortions about the event or generalized
negative attributions about self and
others. The goal of therapy is to assist children
in successful emotional and cognitive
processing of the abuse experience.


The majority of the most rigorous studies
have included parents in the treatment protocol
(e.g., Celano, Hazzard, Webb, &amp; McCall,
1996; Cohen &amp; Mannarino, 1998;
Deblinger, Lippman, &amp; Steer, 1996), although
King et al. (2001) reported no additional
value to the parental receipt of CBT.
The treatment for parents usually contains
similar abuse-focused elements as the children's
treatments, with additional components
designed to reduce parental distress
and teach behavior management strategies
Parental involvement in CBT appeals to be
especially important in reducing behavior

[p. <i>68</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000284024-I00082&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Approaches other than CBT have yet to
be experimentally evaluated, although it is
possible that they are also effective for sexually
abused children. In addition, many children
present for treatment with an array of
problems beyond discrete posttrauma reactions.
Children may have more pervasive
disturbances in affect regulation, attachment
style, and sense of self. An integrated, eclectic
approach such as that developed by
Friedrich (see Chapter 8, this volume) may
be more appropriate in some cases or when
CBT does not produce sufficient improvement.
Because many children who have
been sexually abused have had other adverse
experiences and suffer from comorbid
disorders, treatment should not exclusively
focus on sexual abuse in these instances, and
known effective treatments for other conditions
should be incorporated into the treatment
regimen. In randomized trials, CBT
consistently outperforms nonspecific supportive
therapy.


It seems clear that participation in treatment
does not always result in improvement.
In one longitudinal study, for example,
despite the fact that most children had
treatment, 5 years later there were few
changes in symptoms, and receiving therapy
was not associated with children's status
(Tebbutt et al., 1997).


Treatment modality does not appear to
be an important factor. Early on, group therapy
was considered the preferred approach
because it afforded children an opportunity
to reduce stigmatization. The few studies
that have compared group with individual
or family therapy have not found an advantage
to using groups (e.g., Hyde, Bentovim,
&amp; Monck, 1995), and individual therapy approaches
have been shown to be effective.
This does not mean that group therapy
should be abandoned, only that it should
not be seen as necessary or superior.


Pharmacological treatments are increasingly
used with sexually abused and other
traumatized children, but their effectiveness
has not been shown (AACAP, 1998). A
number of open-label trials with antidepressants
and alpha-adrenergic or beta-blocker
agents suggest these medicines may be helpful
(e.g., Famularo, Kinscherff, &amp; Fenton,
1988). However, there are no placebo-controlled
trials of medication with abused children.
Medication is not recommended as a
primary treatment (AACAP, 1998), although
it may be a useful adjunct to psychosocial
interventions under carefully controlled
conditions. Recommendations for
decision making regarding medication are
available (Donnelly, Amaya-Jackson, &amp;
March, 1999).


There are as yet unanswered questions
about whether all children need treatment
or if abuse-focused CBT is sufficient for
those who have clinically significant
symptomatology. Because many children
exhibit few or moderate posttrauma symptoms,
they may not need a full course of
treatment, even though most of the tested
treatments are relatively brief (10-16 sessions).
It is possible that some children may
receive adequate benefit from a few sessions
that include psycho education, coping strategies,
and anticipatory guidance about recognizing
and responding to problems in the
future (Saywitz et al., 2000). Of course, a
careful assessment that screens for risk
factors known to be associated with more serious
outcomes and that considers the possibility
that children are engaging in maladaptive
avoidance should precede decisions not
to engage in ongoing treatment.


At the other end of the spectrum are children
who have multiple problems, some or
all of which may not be abuse related. Many
sexually abused children have comorbid
conditions, including anxiety disorders, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), and disruptive behavior problems.
Sexual abuse may co-occur with other
forms of violence, abuse, and psychiatric
conditions in parents. Abused children may
have attachment problems. All of these conditions

<b>Treatment Issues With Adults</b>


Because of the complex array of symptoms
evidenced by many adult survivors of
sexual abuse, diagnosis and treatment of
such individuals require careful attention to
a variety of issues (see Chapter 10, this volume).
Survivors in treatment may satisfy diagnostic
criteria for several different forms
of psychological disturbance, including various
affective, dissociative, and somatization
disorders; posttraumatic stress; and substance
abuse or addiction (Pribor &amp;
Dinwiddle, 1992; Saunders et al., 1992;
Stein et al., 1988). As a result of this complexity,
clinicians run the risk of over or
underdiagnosing or of being distracted by
diagnosis per se. A case in point is border-line
personality disorder (BPD). The association
between a childhood sexual abuse history
and the diagnosis of BPD has received
particular attention in the literature (Briere
&amp; Zaidi, 1989; Paris, Zweig, &amp; Guzder, 1994)
because many of the affective and interpersonal
sequelae of chronic child abuse are
contained in the diagnostic criteria for BPD.
On the other hand, a number of studies suggest
that childhood sexual abuse is probably
not the only (or even the largest) etiological
factor in borderline personality disorder
(Fossati, Madeddu, &amp; Maffei, 1999). The excessive
or reflexive use of this diagnosis with
abuse survivors demonstrates that the mere
application of a diagnostic label is often not
helpful without a contextual understanding
of the specific dynamics and phenomenology
of the childhood events that underlie it
(Briere, 1992; Kroll, 1993).


Because of the many abuse-related problems
cited earlier and the prevalence of
childhood sexual abuse among clinical
groups, a number of authors have elucidated
abuse-specific treatment methodologies
with adults (e.g., Briere, 1996a, 1996b;
Gourtois, 1988; Jehu, 1988; M. P. Mendel,
1995; S. Mendel, 1995; Roth &amp; Batson,
1997). Only a few studies, however, have
evaluated treatment interventions with
adults sexually abused as children. These
studies generally indicate that structured,
empirically based approaches are helpful
(Alexander, Neimeyer, &amp; Follette, 1991;
Chard, Weaver, &amp; Resick, 1997; Follette, Alexander,
&amp; Follette, 1991; Smucker &amp;
Niederee, 1995). These treatment studies
suggest that although there is significant
benefit with an interpersonal group therapy
approach in terms of reducing symptoms of
depression and social anxiety, treatment effects
are mitigated by the current support
system and education of the survivor. Such
treatment may be most helpful as an adjunct
to individual therapy. Although clinical outcome
data are limited at this time, abuse-specific
treatment is probably more helpful in
the resolution of postabuse trauma than are
therapies that overlook the existence and
impact of childhood molestation. Because
the known effects of childhood sexual victimization
are so varied (e.g., posttraumatic
symptoms, cognitive distortions, problems
with self-development, and disturbed relatedness),
abuse-focused therapy must respond
to a wide range of clinical problems
and employ a variety of treatment interventions
rather than rely on any single therapeutic
approach or philosophy.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Sexual abuse is a relativity common experience
in the lives of children, and sexually
abused children typically suffer psychological
aftereffects. Of great concern is the
fact that such experiences not only produce
immediate difficulties but also constitute a
significant risk factor for the development of
subsequent health, psychiatric, and life-functioning
difficulties. Important mediating
variables have been identified, including
characteristics of the abuse and support
from the family. Prospective studies are
needed that will allow us to understand the
processes and experiences that mitigate or
exacerbate abuse effects. In the relative absence
of such research, intervention efforts
should be designed not only to ameliorate
current symptoms but also to promote an
emotional and cognitive resolution that may
improve the likelihood of a positive outcome
in later years.
