BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So before we turn this on, you're saying that you're unusually cold.  Are you tired?  Unusually tired?  Because -
<b>PT:</b> When I get tired, I get irritable.
<b>DR:</b> Well, because the important thing for us to think about is that low thyroid would be associated with depression, and, uh, that might account for being colder too because your thyroid, uh, is involved in regulating a lot of metabolic activities, and if it's slowed down -
<b>PT:</b> Well, another thing I noticed is that typically, this time of year, I gain weight.  I'm not gaining weight, I'm losing weight.
<b>DR:</b> Well, that goes in a contrary direction.  Typically, people who have low thyroid feel sluggish, they can feel depressed, uh, would gain weight.  People who have too much, hyperthyroid, too much, would be anxious, weight loss, uh -
<b>PT:</b> I'm anxious.
<b>DR:</b> So, um, you know, your, your not gaining weight might be, also because of depression because people who are, some people who are depressed, they eat more because they feel lousy and they want to try and feel better.  Some people eat less because they have no ambition, they have no desire, no appetite.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I've got all these different things going on.  You know, it's like too much.  It's like every, what I have noticed about myself is that anytime there are, uh, unforeseen stress -
<b>DR:</b> Yes.
<b>PT:</b> That then that is what provokes me into the no sleep.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, and of course, with my dog, per se, almost dying, again, because it was last February, he, he's 15 years old, so more like 90-something or 100.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, with that, then with my mother-in-law, then all I've been doing is, whereas my wife's gotten a break because now she's staying at [DEIDENTIFIED] to go to visit her mother in the hospital, of which she's wishing she would just go ahead and pass away because she really is suffering.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, then she puts her, it's not really her, it's like, then I feel inadequate because then I'm not able to be there in a supportive role for her.  Then I just transfer everything to my mother, who, you know, I'm taking stuff out on her even coming here.  I would just asked her to be quiet.  Like, she's putting her lipstick on, and that's annoying me.  She's starting to file her nails, that's annoying me.  You know, and I'm just asking her just to be, and I couldn't let her drive here because we weren't going to get here in time.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So, I just don't know.  I'm like, you know, this has been going on, and this is what it comes and it goes, but then when it hits me, it's bad, and then nobody else really under, like I don't think my wife really understands because I told her last night, or this morning, that I hadn't sleep all night because I was up every hour.  I don't even, I don't, like if I go to sleep, it's just nodding for like 10 or 15 minutes.  Like, my mother called me at 10:05 this morning, the last time I looked at the clock, it was 9:55, so I must have nodded out from 9:55 until when she called.  But, that's after having been up all night.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And having been up basically the night before and not resting.  And -
<b>DR:</b> So the Ambien is not helping?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> You're taking that every night?  It's not helping?
<b>PT:</b> Well, it, it, I, I don't know.  Mom, you said I was, but see, I still, I, it's almost like I'm not sleeping, or I don't go to sleep at night because I don't want to deal with waking up in the morning, although waking up in the morning, I don't have any issues right now because I'm not working.  But, I haven't stopped thinking about work, and I'm saying to myself, I'm almost, I'm dread, I'm, I'm really like, going, I, I have never entertained the thought of suicide, or homicide, as much as I lately have because I really want to go, and I said, you know, if this continues, I'm thinking about going, and saying to myself, that like, I should go shoot my supervisor who started all of this years ago, and then I'm saying well, then I should just kill myself, and then I wouldn't have to deal with this.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But then I know that that's the easy way out, and that I really don't want to hurt myself.  I really don't, but I'm just saying, I can't keep going through life like this.  This is like ridiculous because I'm worrying about everything.
<b>DR:</b> Well, listen, you're going through a very bad depression, and people that I've treated, who've had bad depression, have had other medical problems, or other problems in their life say, "I'd rather have those."  The depression was the worst.  It's a very hard thing to go through.  So we're not going to allow you to continue to feel this way.  We're not going to allow you to continue have these bad thoughts, okay.  What I was doing while you were talking, was I was writing down, unfortunately, in psychiatry, at present, it's inevitable that there's a trial and error process, that the medicines are not smart.  Remember when you were a little kid and you though aspirin knew where the pain was?
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> Well, these medicines are no smarter than the aspirin.  You know, the aspirin does what it does.  Sometimes it helps people.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Same with these medicines.  They all work in some people.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> But in some people they only cause side effects, or they don't really work optimally.  So we, we, you know, we've tried several medicines.  So based on your experience, we're going to try and pick right going forward.  Now just -
<b>PT:</b> Now, now in my mind, I'm afraid because the, the, uh, the side effects that I had with the Zoloft, and then what I perceived coming with the Luvox, it seemed like almost the same thing was going to happen again, and it was so discomfort.  I mean -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> To the point that I almost went -
<b>DR:</b> Right, right.
<b>PT:</b> To the hospital when I was having problems with the Zoloft, because -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then now, last night, my eating schedule is so screwed up -
<b>DR:</b> But, but it doesn't, having a very bad reaction with one does not predict that you're going to have a very bad reaction with the other.  Plus, um, even though it's rough for you to go through, going through a couple trials helps us understand, well, if that one didn't work well, it [INAUDIBLE] now is the feel, you know -
<b>PT:</b> I'm, I'm, I'm hoping I'm not having, like becoming, like hypochondriac -
<b>DR:</b> No, no, no, no.
<b>PT:</b> As in that whereas I'm saying that mentally -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I'm going to start thinking that.  Oh, here's a side effect, so I, because typically I don't do well with a lot of medi, any medication -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Typically.  Whether it be antibiotics, there's a certain few that I'm all right with -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then there's the whole other gamet that I get the side effects, turn orange in sunlight, and all of that.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> So -
<b>DR:</b> Well, let me, uh, remind myself, the other medical problems that you have are high blood pressure.  Any other medical problems?
<b>PT:</b> Diabetes.
<b>DR:</b> But you're not treated for that?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> It's like borderline.  You've never been treated with medication.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, now, up until the other day, and I don't, it, it's probably my diet, but it's not that, uh, it, the other day I've been running like 128.  I usually don't go over 120, where years ago, 120 was the cutoff, anything under 120 you weren't diabetic, anything 120 and above, you were considered.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Then they changed that from 120 to 100.  So once they changed the -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Then I was diagnosed, now the other day, I woke up and it was 97.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Now, that was the night that we went to the hospital with the dog.
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And I came back at 3:30 in the morning, ate 2 bowls of Corn Flakes, a banana, and 2 pieces of bread with cream cheese, and then went to bed at about 4:00 or 5:00 -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then when I checked my blood sugar, it was like 7 hours later, at 12:00 -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> And it was 97.  So I got no rhyme or reason why -
<b>CG:</b> May I inter, interject?
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> Because we sat at the hospital, and he cried because the dog was sick -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> And then he started to speak calmly, nicely, we talked about all kinds of different things, and he was laughing a little bit -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>CG:</b> And happy a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> And it's sort of like -
<b>PT:</b> I guess she's saying she felt like she could see the tension release out of us.
<b>CG:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But then, now then I came up because I had to bring the dog, because I think the dog has separation anxiety -
<b>DR:</b> And the, the, the only other, med, medical problem that you mentioned in the past was elevated cholesterol.
<b>PT:</b> Not really.
<b>DR:</b> Not really, okay.
<b>PT:</b> No.  Um, I -
<b>DR:</b> So -
<b>PT:</b> I can't get my knee surgery because my blood pressure's too high.
<b>DR:</b> Really?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You've been on Benicar, right?
<b>PT:</b> Benicar, and then this, uh, I don't even know the name.  I want to say andophilin or something.  It's a little white, like hexagonal -
<b>DR:</b> They've added another medicine?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, my doctor added another medication, then when I went back 2 or 3 weeks after [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] saw me, and he checked my blood pressure just, what was it, the other day I went?
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Like a week ago, and he saw that my blood pressure is still elevated.
<b>DR:</b> And what was the second medicine?  Think carefully what you, we could call -
<b>PT:</b> I took it this morning I don't -
<b>DR:</b> We could call the pharmacy and find out, right?
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> And so he increased that, it was, uh, -
<b>DR:</b> It sounded like you wanted to say amlodipine, or something like that?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> Is that right?
<b>PT:</b> That's it.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's what it sounds like?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> So he, I was taking one with the Benicar, and now he has me on 2 with the Benicar.  I'm supposed to see him on the [DATE].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because he's concerned because it's like, no matter what he's doing, and I know what's causing the, uh, I can't stop worrying about anything.
<b>DR:</b> And when was the last time you got all the blood tests done?
<b>PT:</b> Um, very recently.
<b>DR:</b> How recently?
<b>PT:</b> Because I was going for my physical to get my medical endorsement on my CDL license.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  And did they do thyroid tests, do you know at that time?
<b>PT:</b> I don't know.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to give you a slip to get thyroid tested, just in the event that, that wasn't performed, but he, if he just did them, I'll have to write him a note.  If he just did them, then of course, there's no need, and if he did them, and he didn't say anything to you, I assume that they're normal.  I'm assuming -
<b>PT:</b> That he said all my blood work came back normal.
<b>DR:</b> I'm assuming everything is fine [PATIENT NAME], and, um, but, if for any reason he didn't check that, we'll just check that one other thing.  Let's, for the time being, assume that everything's normal, okay?  So then, what we're doing is we're dealing with depression and post-traumatic symptoms, and the medicines that we put you on are reasonable medicines, but they have not been helpful so far.
<b>PT:</b> Because I never had a problem with Zoloft before.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  But when we went up, it caused all the stomach problems.  Now, you were never on, when you, when you went up on the Zoloft, was it making you very tired?
<b>PT:</b> I have no memory.  Uh -
<b>DR:</b> It wasn't that long ago.
<b>PT:</b> No, I have no short-term memory.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Um, I wouldn't say it was making me tired.
<b>DR:</b> It was not making you real tired.
<b>PT:</b> No, I -
<b>DR:</b> Was this one making you real tired?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, not really, but I was taking this one in the evening -
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> Because originally, we, I was taking the Zoloft during the day, and then we went to the evening on it.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But I, I still now, I'm still having a lot of, uh, gastric issues.
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> Like last night, we went to the hospital so now that prolonged the time, when did I eat at home?
<b>CG:</b> About 12:30 -
<b>PT:</b> I ate at 12:30 and then -
<b>CG:</b> One o'clock.
<b>PT:</b> And then didn't eat until 8:30.
<b>CG:</b> Eight thirty.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>CG:</b> See, and that means -
<b>PT:</b> And I started getting the gas before we went to go eat at Charlie Browns.  Then once I ate, the gas seemed to subside.
<b>DR:</b> When you -
<b>PT:</b> But then when I came back after we got back at the house -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> All of the sudden, then the gas started again.  Now, the gas was so bad prior to us going to the hospital that I drank, uh, a glass of Effervescence stuff to try to help, and it seems like, as long as I'm standing or laying prone -
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> It's not as bad.  Sitting, that's why I'm kind of sitting like this with my butt scooted forward -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> It seems like when I sit, sit, that is when -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> I have an issue.
<b>DR:</b> Well, here's what my thinking is.  Um, you're saying that the Luvox is bothering your stomach similar to how the Zoloft is.
<b>PT:</b> Only when I went to the, um, only when I went up to the 2.  I was on 1 1/2 and I called you and I said that the Luvox didn't seem like it was doing anything.
<b>DR:</b> Doing anything.  But at 2 -
<b>PT:</b> At 2, but, I don't know if it's me.  I don't know if it's my nerves.  I almost think it's my nerves.  I think that anytime something upsets me, or it comes from what I perceive as coming out of left field, and I wasn't prepared for it, that I almost think that I'm bringing it, the upsetness onto myself.
<b>DR:</b> There's no question, you know, that medicines can have a placebo response, either good or bad.  Sometimes if people really hope, and feel, and suspect this is going to help, they, it, it -
<b>PT:</b> It helps more.  Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  Hope and worry and, I mean, on the other hand, they worry and fret that something bad is going to happen and -
<b>PT:</b> That's where I was saying before.  I'm like wondering if I'm being psychosomatic now in actually -
<b>DR:</b> Because for people with the combination of depression and post-traumatic symptoms, I tend to use the medicines in the more common spectrum.  So that's Zoloft, and Luvox, and Paxil.  There's another medicine, a little over, called Lexapro, which it seems to have less side effects on average.  It still can cause these side effects, but it tends to have less than average, and then there's other ones that are options too.  So I'm kind of deciding.  I'm listening to you, and I'm trying to decide, should we give the Luvox a little more time, or should we switch to the Paxil.  Because the Paxil, -
<b>PT:</b> Or the Lexapro?  Paxil or Lexapro?
<b>DR:</b> I was really thinking Paxil.  Paxil has an excellent record at treating anxiety symptoms and depressions, but it's a little more side effects on average, in terms of, uh, not the things that you're having, but you know, sometimes people can gain a little bit of weight on it.  Sometimes it might be a little tiring.  So, you can never say never.  You -
<b>PT:</b> Well the Paxil, the first time I tried it, years ago, that's was what made me weird.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, okay, but, uh, uh, that's important, then, I, I don't remember that.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, that -
<b>DR:</b> That was before we were meeting.
<b>PT:</b> Right, that was, uh, what the, the psychiatrist that I was seeing, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER], from [DEIDENTIFIED], uh, that, a person from [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Now, you said to me unusual behavior.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> What was the unusual behavior?
<b>PT:</b> Remember I told you I think it was even last week or so, I said that, uh, it took me 2 days to pack a pickup truck, so -
<b>DR:</b> So you were confused.
<b>PT:</b> No, it just wasn't right.  I'd pack it and unpack it.  Pack it and unpack it.  It just wasn't right, then I would be talking with friends, or neighbors, and once I decided I was done talking, I would tell them I'll see you later, and I was at my house, basically dismissing them to go ahead and leave.
<b>DR:</b> So you were like finicky and, and, and, uh, obsessive?
<b>PT:</b> I, well, that's when we went on the trip, and it took my wife from New Jersey to [DEIDENTIFIED] to get me to pull over and let her drive because I had the incident -
<b>DR:</b> But you had to pack and unpack the, because you didn't feel it was packed properly?
<b>PT:</b> I guess.  And my wife, you know, I was, she couldn't even reason with me, I mean, I wouldn't hear it, you know, she had to actually walk, I was just like real weird.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> But see then, like even with my temperature, like now, I'm starting to get hot.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But I have long johns on.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And socks, and this, but my hands are still cold, like, and then at night, I'm sleeping in this -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Because I have to cover my head because if I don't have something on my head, I seem to get too cold.  Like last night, it was like -
<b>DR:</b> But I have the same affliction because when you don't have hair on your head, you do get cold.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I think you lose a lot of heat through your head.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You do.  I, I have to wear a hat when I go outside, otherwise I'm dying.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well, that, and then I have this like Klondike hat I wear -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> In the house when I'm getting, but my temperature is like, usually that's an indication, indicator to me that I'm getting sick.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> But this is like weird.  You know, I, but I feel like if I don't put my hood on, or my head covered at night, but then I'll go through the night like that.  Like last night, then I, I had the bed on, then I got too hot.  Then I had to come out of everything.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And so it's just all these discomforts, um, in, in my mind, I'm saying to myself, if I could just get the sleep issue.  If I could ever feel like that I had a really restful sleep again, I would wake up in a better frame of mind, and not feel like it's, uh, uh, I don't even wan to go to work.  I don't even want to work anymore right now.  Right now, I don't want to work because it is, and it's weighing on me because it's not a healthy thought, the, the, and it's not a normal thought.  Like I, I tell my wife, I said [NAME OTHER], I worked at [DEIDENTIFIED] for 10 years.  Did you ever know a time that I just said I didn't want to go to work that there wasn't a legitimate reason?  Either I was really, really sick, or I had a doctor's appointment, or something like that.  Did you ever know, through that whole course, of me, per se, saying no, and coming up with excuses not to go, and she even said no.  I said, well I don't understand now why I'm afraid, I, I kind of know because I'm afraid that with this not proper sleep, one, it changes my whole personality.  I'm very short.  I'm very, um, -
<b>CG:</b> Argumentive.
<b>PT:</b> Argumentive, and just everything that's someone else does, if it's not the way that I think it should be done, it irritates me to the point that I can't even keep my mouth shut about it, and then when I tell my wife and my mother, it's that you don't understand when I don't vocalize it, then I internalize it, and then that tears me up.  So I'm like caught in between keeping my mouth shut for the sake of, in, in, my marriage, the sake of my, trying to keep my mother healthy, although it bothers me that I have to call her and ask her to drive up her at [AGE], to drive all the way up here from [DEIDENTIFIED] to come with me to come here, and then she's going to drive because now, although I know need her help and she's helping me, now I'm also have the additional worry, and the responsibility that if something happens to her while she's going to and fro to come and help me, then I'm going to have that quilt on me, of which that's the same thing with the work, with the, with, uh, uh, with driving the truck, with operating the equipment, I already cut, damn near tried to cut my leg off with the chainsaw a couple years ago from working when I was, shouldn't have been because I, and my wife does not understand.  Like, I told her, hey I'm sorry, oh well, you'll sleep during the day.  And I'm like, you know, I, I couldn't, you know, go on her because she's got a lot watch, I mean, because she's crying like every 2 or 3 minutes, you know, because she's, her mom's dying, and I understand.  I'm like, well, I can't burden her anymore than I've already overburdened her to the point that she doesn't believe any of this.  She thinks that, she thinks that I want to be to like this.  That's what she's told me.  She said, "You don't want to get better.  You don't want to do.  You have it in your mind that you want to be like this."  And I understand why she's saying that because she's trying to get me to, you know, grab, now, my brother called, I haven't spoken to him in a while, and we spoke and he helped a lot, and I felt a lot better after talking with him because he had, was in a marriage that one of his sons had a mental, uh, handicap because he fell out of tree, and he was telling me that basically the medicine is 10% and you're 90%.  You know, the medicine is just, but you have to like, and I was doing all right until [NAME OTHER] got sick and really wasn't moving, and da, da, da, temperature, and I thought he was dying again.  My wife's away, I had to go to the hospital, now I come up, I sit like trooper at the hospital last night with her mother.  Her mother is dying.  It's almost like they really need to just go ahead and just shoot her with like the max dose of morphine, and just let her drift out because all she's doing is just in total discomfort, and you can see it.  And, and I've got all that, and then out of nowhere, then I'm still worrying about the job, about my work.  I took the machines Monday to get them fixed.  I called about snow plowing, and I'm saying, I'm not even doing it.  I can't, I can't, it's like I can't rest.
<b>DR:</b> Right.  All right, let, let's go back for a second.  Um, you, you had, the first thing that happens when you takes these medicines, the first hurdle is the side effects.  If it's a little bit, they usually dissipate.  They usually go away.  If it's a lot, then we stop it.  So that's what happened with the Zoloft.  We went up, it was a lot, so we stopped it.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Now, we're on the Luvox.  We're on it for a relatively short time.  The first thing that you said is it's not doing anything.  Well, it doesn't do anything good until you're on enough for a long enough time.  So again, the first hurdle is, going up gently so we don't encounter too many side effects, and then we give it a couple weeks to see if it's helping.  So you're still on modest dosage.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I stopped.
<b>DR:</b> You stopped, when was that?
<b>PT:</b> The day after I spoke to you.
<b>DR:</b> Did you?  Which was a couple days ago?
<b>CG:</b> No, that was yesterday you stopped, didn't you?  You didn't take it yesterday?
<b>PT:</b> No, no Mom.
<b>CG:</b> Huh?
<b>PT:</b> No, no.
<b>DR:</b> When did we, we spoke over the week -
<b>PT:</b> No, I called -
<b>DR:</b> We spoke over the weekend because I was still sick, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yes, you had laryngitis, yes.
<b>DR:</b> Right, so it was like Sunday.  I think it was Sunday.
<b>PT:</b> Maybe.
<b>DR:</b> Okay, so you've been off it for a couple of days.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I spoke to you that it wasn't doing anything, and I was on the 1 1/2, and you said go to the 2.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then when I went to 2, it seemed like I started to get the gassy -
<b>DR:</b> The stomach upset.  And then -
<b>PT:</b> And then I got afraid because I said I can't go through this again because -
<b>DR:</b> Right.  So here's what I would have you do.  I would retrace our steps a little bit because often times you're doing nothing is the best possibility.  If you take a new medicine and it makes you real nervous, or real sleepy, or really tears up your stomach, forget it.  It's not going to be right for you, but if it does a little bit something, or nothing, that's good.
<b>PT:</b> Or we get use out of it.
<b>DR:</b> So in particular, with the stomach upset, usually people acclimate to it over a week or 2.  Now, it was so bad with Zoloft, we had to stop it, but this is a new story.  It's a new ballgame.  It's a different medicine, you know, it's a cousin.  It was a relationship with Zoloft, but it is different, and typically, I think we said this last time.  Zoloft tends to cause diarrhea more than the other ones, definitely.  This one typically, it's going to cause maybe a little nausea, if anything, maybe the other way a bit, constipation, not diarrhea.
<b>PT:</b> Not, right, I, I wouldn't say I had diarrhea or anything, but then I got the fear in my mind, well, if I'm constipated, and then I finally go, like now, I'm afraid to push.
<b>DR:</b> Well, I guess -
<b>PT:</b> Because now I'm afraid, well, like damn -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Am I going to have a worse case with the hemorrhoids, you know.
<b>DR:</b> But, you, you, maybe we should give you a second medicine to help with anxiety a little bit, just to help you through this because you're worrying about more, and more, and more things now.  So, um, I'd like to give the Luvox another chance before we abandon it, and we can go up slowly, and as, you know, no news is good news, as long as it's not bothering you, we keep creeping up slowly -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I should have probably said something to you when, I should have said, well, I'm only on the 1 1/2, this is only like Day 1 or Day 2 of 1 1/2 -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> Now I'm not feeling anything.
<b>DR:</b> And it's a 50 mg pill, and typically, when we treat people, they're on 150 mg, so we were trying to get you, up side to 100, then the, then maybe go up again, and then we, we're hoping to hit pay dirt, you know, once you get up to about 150.  The typical dosage that people are on is really 100 to 200.  So I'm going to write out a schedule for you to retrace our steps.  Maybe hop back on the 50 for a couple of days, then go up to 75 for a couple of days, you know go up slowly.
<b>PT:</b> Fifty is the 1 pill?
<b>DR:</b> It's the 1 pill.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because we started at 1/2 -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then we went to the 1.
<b>DR:</b> Right, we don't have to go all the back to 1/2.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> But I also wonder, what if I gave you a mild anti-anxiety medicine to take here and there.  In other words, if you had trouble sleeping, or if you, if your dog was sick again, or, or, or, or you were upset for any reason again, you could take it on occasion, and if you didn't need it, you didn't have to take it.  Something to take as needed just to get your through the next week or two.  Hopefully get you up to a dosage of the Luvox that's starting to help, and then hopefully smooth sailing.
<b>PT:</b> All right.
<b>CG:</b> Um, -
<b>PT:</b> I'm supposed to go to this sleep study tomorrow.
<b>DR:</b> You're doing a sleep study?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, and I'm just like -
<b>DR:</b> Do they suspect sleep apnea?
<b>PT:</b> No, I don't, I don't know what -
<b>DR:</b> You don't know what, because you're not sleeping well?
<b>PT:</b> I read it in the, I read in the, in that, uh, in the information they gave me on it, they were saying that, you know, chronic insomnia -
<b>DR:</b> Can contribute to depression.
<b>PT:</b> Right, and I'm like saying to myself, like, well, I don't know if what I have is considered insomnia.  I'm thinking it's insomnia because I'm not getting the right -
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] so let's do the sleep study.  Let's do the thyroid test.  Let's exclude any medical problems that might be contributing.  Um, if you're going to do the sleep study, I wouldn't have you start the new medicine until after because they don't want any, um, anything that's a sleeping-type medicine.  They probably would not have you take the Ambien.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, no, when I spoke to them, they said, I told them I'm on Ambien, they said, oh no, you can, you can, uh -
<b>DR:</b> You can take it?
<b>PT:</b> You know, that's what, if you norm, if you've been on it -
<b>DR:</b> Oh really?
<b>PT:</b> You can take it because I, because I don't even sleep with it.  That's what, see originally that's what lead me with the Lunesta to be taken 2 -
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> A night, because I, you know, every 4 hour, I would wake up and then I would wake up and then I would be in fear that if I don't get the right rest, how am I going to go to work.  So I would take the other one at 3:00, 4:00 in the morning because I said, "I have to get, I have to have my rest to be able to function out here."
<b>DR:</b> I've got you.  All right.  I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you the Lorazepam to take as needed, but let's not start until after the sleep study.  And I'm going to give you a schedule to gradually creep up on the Luvox, and let's give it a chance before we start -
<b>PT:</b> I've also had the Lorazepam before.
<b>DR:</b> And what happened?
<b>PT:</b> I was fine.  I was like Lorazepam, trazodone, um, you know, some of that tends to make you a little groggy in the morning, but -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, I'm not driving then.
<b>DR:</b> The trazodone, you had told me in the past, you felt, um, you were tired the next morning.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, grog, just grog, groggy, like, you wouldn't want to get in and have to drive any distance.
<b>CG:</b> What if, what if, uh, what about -
<b>PT:</b> See I'm like -
<b>CG:</b> What about him, uh, sleeping up in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I told him I would be glad to go back and forth with him, if he can't sleep up there.  Maybe [PHYSICIAN NAME], if you write a little note to [NAME OTHER], I mean, just say, it doesn't have to be to her, but just say what [PATIENT NAME] can't do.  Maybe that would help her understand.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, mom, I don't know how she's going to understand anything at this point and time.
<b>CG:</b> Well, if the doctor says that you shouldn't be doing this [PATIENT NAME], then she'll have to understand.  Do you understand what I'm saying [PHYSICIAN NAME]?
<b>DR:</b> What, what, what should she not want him to do?
<b>CG:</b> He feels guilty for not being up there, now if he could go everyday, but not sleep there, is what I'm saying.
<b>DR:</b> So she's staying at her mother's house and then spending the whole day at the hospital?
<b>PT:</b> No, huh-uh.  No, she goes to work, and then she'll go over to the hospital after work.
<b>DR:</b> I see.
<b>PT:</b> Because she's basically done with, she's a school teacher, so she's finished with work at like 2:30.
<b>DR:</b> And where does she sleep?
<b>PT:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>DR:</b> Um-hum.
<b>PT:</b> Because she is, the hospital's in [DEIDENTIFIED], so it really is not practical for her to drive all the way from [DEIDENTIFIED] because she teaches in [DEIDENTIFIED], which is like [DEIDENTIFIED].  It doesn't make sense for her to drive from [DEIDENTIFIED] to [DEIDENTIFIED] and then, you know, and then, uh -
<b>CG:</b> But you can't feel guilty [PATIENT NAME].  You have to feel well.
<b>PT:</b> You say that, but I'm still going to feel guilty, that's the problem.  I already know because I'm already, I mean -
<b>CG:</b> If you go up everyday and I ride with you, or I drive, that's what I'm saying.  It's still being supportive, but you're still home in your bed, where you have to be, is what I'm saying.  That's why I think [PHYSICIAN NAME] could say [PATIENT NAME], that you need your bed to sleep.
<b>PT:</b> No, I,  for the rationally logically thinking person, yes, that would make sense, but I'm not right there, I'm not at, I'm not [INAUDIBLE].
<b>CG:</b> I'm not talking about you.  I'm talking about -
<b>PT:</b> But I'm saying -
<b>CG:</b> It's irrational.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if that's going to help mom, I mean, because I, I, I don't know.
<b>CG:</b> Well you're no good, you're no good to anybody if you're not getting sleep and you're crabby and cranky.
<b>PT:</b> You know, what do I do?  The dogs are out in the car now.  What am I going to do with them?  You can't leave them at home.
<b>CG:</b> No, but you're going, we're going to take them everyday, [PATIENT NAME], just like you're taking them now.  [INAUDIBLE] the problem, the problem is you can't sleep there.
<b>DR:</b> Here's, here's the schedule I want to try.  Um, I'm going to have you hop back on the Luvox, take it after dinner tonight.
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> So for 3 nights, take one, if that's going okay, then for 5 nights, we'll go slow, for 5 nights take 1 1/2.  So Saturday through Wednesday.  If that's going okay.  Now, if it causes a little bit of drowsiness, a little bit of nausea, stomach upset, that's okay.  If it's a lot, then you're going to hold off and call me.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> If it's going okay, then go up to 2 for 5 nights, and then 3.  So we're trying to gradually creep up.  And then, um, I would take it after dinner because all things being equal, Luvox tends to be a little bit sedative so it would kick in at bedtime and hopefully help you sleep, and all these medicines seem to be a little better tolerated taken with food.  If you take them on an empty stomach, it does bother your stomach.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.  Now I did notice that I may be a little sleepier early too.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Before it was like 1:00 or 2:00, and I take the Luvox after dinner, then it's like 12:00.
<b>DR:</b> It might be a nice fit where it's helping you fall asleep, and it's helping the depression.  Then I'm going to give you a slip for the thyroid test, and you've got the sleep study, that's good.  You know, we want to cover all the basis.  Uh, and then I'll give you a script for the Lorazepam, which is something that you could take on an as-needed basis.  You could, the first time you take it, maybe even just try it tonight just to get a sense of it.  You can just take a half.  The main concern with Lorazepam is, if you're nervous, it's going to calm you.  If you're calm, it's going to make you a little sleepy, so you have to use caution with driving.  You shouldn't take it for the first time before you're going to on a long drive somewhere.  You have to see how it affects -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> If they put you in a careful driving simulator, you would step on the brake a little more slowly in an emergency situation -
<b>PT:</b> Um-hum.
<b>DR:</b> On that, again, because it's a muscle relaxer a little bit.  So it's not something I want to have you on long term because if you're going to be driving or something, you know, but just temporarily to get you through this rough period.  It's an option, and then, and then we'll see.  We, we, we're trying to the Luvox, and seeing if it's going to be a good fit.  If it is, great.  If it's not, then there's other choices, but I think we, you're a little premature in stopping it.  That's what I think.  Uh, I, I don't know how to advise you as far as with [NAME OTHER].  She's going through a terrible thing, so I would, more as a husband than a, a, a psychiatrist, I'd say if you could extend yourself a little bit for her, to let her know, you know, be empathic that you know that she's going through a terrible thing, and even though you're going through a rough time, that you really would like to be there and help her, you know, whether it's getting up there to visit, or staying overnight a time with her, or whatever, whatever you think would be helpful .  I'm sure she'd appreciate it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well she said last night, she appreciates it, and I said, that's another things she said last night, she as glad I was there.
<b>DR:</b> Right, because it's terrible to go through by yourself.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, and then, I'm like, you know, I don't know if that's really good for me because I'm like sitting there, and I'm like -
<b>CG:</b> Well, don't go -
<b>PT:</b> It's like another -
<b>CG:</b> Well, if, uh, well -
<b>DR:</b> Well, you think it's going to upset you?
<b>PT:</b> Uh, it's definitely upsetting me.
<b>CG:</b> It does.
<b>DR:</b> You're close with her mother?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, because I was close with her mother.  Uh, it's very disturbing.  I mean, I, I, I can't even say anything to her mother because it is, every, it's ev, all of this is all upsetting, and -
<b>DR:</b> Well, I think what you've got to do then -
<b>PT:</b> Uh -
<b>DR:</b> Is strike a balance between extending yourself so that your wife feels supported and appreciated, and, you know, and maybe, you know, not, not, upsetting you too much, but I, -
<b>PT:</b> It's like a rough balance, you know.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, but you know what, here's the thing, you're definitely going to get better.  Her mother's not.  It's going to be a short-term thing.  I mean, you said she's dying, and you know, I, I would try and be there.  I think if, if you don't extend yourself a little bit, then she might resent that you weren't there when she really needed you.
<b>PT:</b> Uh, I'm sure she, I mean, that's the way, that's the way it, it kind of feels.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> You know, because the fact that she told me she was glad I was there -
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, I would try and rise to the occasion as best as you can.
<b>PT:</b> Okay.
<b>DR:</b> So here's the Lorazepam script.  I think you have everything else you need.  What other questions do you have?
<b>CG:</b> Your opinion to have that filled in [DEIDENTIFIED], [NAME OTHER], because you're not going back to [DEIDENTIFIED] if you're staying up here.
<b>PT:</b> I don't know if I'm staying up.
<b>DR:</b> Well, he could have it filled anywhere, where your registered -
<b>CG:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> With the pharmacy.
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> It's um, it's, what, what pharmacy do you use in [DEIDENTIFIED]?
<b>PT:</b> ShopRite.
<b>DR:</b> Is there a ShopRite right around, um -
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, but I don't know if they have a pharmacy.
<b>CG:</b> I don't know [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> I don't even know if I'm staying because it's like I can't sleep there.
<b>DR:</b> Well, you know what, don't start this tonight anyway -
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Because remember I said don't start until after your sleep study because let's not introduce a new variable.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> You do the Luvox and do the Ambien.
<b>CG:</b> That's why I was saying, wouldn't it be supportive if we came everyday up there?  I mean, not staying the night with [NAME OTHER], but be there for when she goes to the hospital, and you come back home to sleep.  That's what I was trying -
<b>DR:</b> That's your question.
<b>PT:</b> Well, I don't know if that's going to work, Mom.
<b>DR:</b> Why?
<b>CG:</b> Why?
<b>PT:</b> The time, the time, well, I guess I would because she doesn't really go until -
<b>CG:</b> Four o'clock.
<b>DR:</b> Where's your sleep study being done?
<b>PT:</b> At -
<b>CG:</b> In [DEIDENTIFIED].
<b>PT:</b> At [DEIDENTIFIED] Hospital.
<b>DR:</b> Uh, okay.
<b>PT:</b> And I'm like -
<b>DR:</b> Well, I would, again, -
<b>PT:</b> From my point of normal, it's almost like, why go home now.  Right?
<b>DR:</b> My feeling about it would be to defer to [NAME OTHER]'s wishes.  In other words, say what would you, what would she like you to do?  You know, you're thinking that you'd come visit every day, be there with her, maybe go home at night, is that, you know -
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Give her the choice, again, so she feels that she has some control over what's going on at the moment.
<b>CG:</b> Right, it's hard.  It's hard on her.
<b>PT:</b> It's real hard.
<b>CG:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> She's crying every 2 minutes.  Every 2, every 5 minutes she goes from one extreme to the other, which, you know, is totally understandable.
<b>CG:</b> She's very close to her mom.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so then you and I, today's the [DATE], let's, I would say let's tentatively look at the [DATE].
<b>CG:</b> What's today?
<b>DR:</b> Which is 2 weeks.
<b>PT:</b> I guess, yeah, because the [DATE] I have to go see [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].
<b>DR:</b> Okay.  Uh, and I have to give you a slip for the thyroid test.  Okay.  Um, I could do 10:30 in the morning on that day.  I could do early afternoon.
<b>PT:</b> Early afternoon is better because typically I, I really sleep until like, I try to sleep until 10:00.
<b>DR:</b> How do you feel about 2:30?
<b>PT:</b> Two thirty, I guess is okay.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Okay, it's not really -
<b>CG:</b> If I could get you into bed earlier, that would help.  Like 11:00.
<b>DR:</b> I'm going to turn this off.
<b>CG:</b> Let that be the cutoff, [PATIENT NAME].
<b>PT:</b> What good is it going to do me getting into bed, and then I'm sitting there not -
