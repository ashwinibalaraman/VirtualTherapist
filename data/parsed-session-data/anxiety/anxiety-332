It is not uncommon for stress and stress
management in the workplace to be
treated with apprehension, suspicion,
and a certain degree of cynicism. Constant
media attention and well-publicized stress
litigation cases have helped to create a
negative and unhelpful climate resulting
in some reluctance to tackle a potentially
costly workplace problem. Stress seems to
have become an organizational whipping
boy, blamed for all our ills and wrongs and
in danger of becoming the "back pain" of
the 21st century. An unhelpful and damaging
view of stress as a "four-etter word"
will persist unless we can eliminate the
myths and nonsense that surround the
concept of stress.


Certain problems arise because stress,
like love and electricity, cannot be seen or
touched. Most of us have experience with
these concepts but find them difficult to
understand and explain. In addition, many
managers believe that "if you cannot see it,
you cannot measure it; if you cannot
measure it, you cannot manage it."


In such a negative organizational climate,
the need to proactively tackle work-related
problems is denied and even ignored. Thus,
employees tend to hide a stress condition
rather than admit that they cannot cope.
The business and humanistic costs associated
with this behavior are enormous, and
everyone suffers in the long term.


Recent figures provided by the Health
and Safety Executive (2001) suggest that
stress-elated illness is responsible for the
loss of 6.5 million working days each year,
costing British employers around £370
million (about $518 million) and British
society as a whole as much as £375 billion
(about $525 billion). The true impact of
mismanaged stress must be viewed in terms
of costs associated with poor performance
and productivity, increased accidents at
work, high labor turnover, forced early
retirement, ill health, job dissatisfaction,
and unhappiness, in addition to increased
insurance premiums and compensation and
stress litigation costs.


If we examine the business case and
understand the real costs associated with
mismanaged stress, the need to tackle workrelated
stress is paramount and the potential
benefits are tremendous.

[p. <i>34</i>]

In this chapter, we suggest that to
manage stress successfully, we must acknowledge
and define what we mean by stress. We
need to recognize the effects of exposure to
stress and understand how and why stress is
damaging in its consequences. To do this,
we offer a theoretical framework by describing
certain models of stress. Exploration of
models of job stress and an understanding
of the evolution of such models provide an
explanation of the stress mechanism and how
and why exposure to certain conditions and
situations has an adverse impact on health,
job performance, and quality of life. Most
importantly, it guides action in the management
of stress. At both organizational and
individual levels, it is important that we
know how and why exposure to the contemporary
work environment might lead to poor
performance, low productivity, and ill health.

<b>A Layperson Model of Stress</b>

A common assumption is that "stress is
what happens to people." This is misleading
and likely to be the cause of error in our
understanding about the nature of stress.
Such perceptions held by employees, work
colleagues, staff, customers, or clients might
lead to faulty thinking, inappropriate blame,
and damage to self-confidence. The organization
also suffers because stress management
initiatives are likely to be restricted in
scope, effectiveness, and success. Thus, an
essential part of any stress management
initiative is to ensure that everyone involved
is aware of the nature of stress and how it is
damaging in its consequences.


Misinformation and faulty thinking
about stress are commonly observed. Pause
for a moment or two and write down the
words or phrases that immediately come
into your mind when you think about the
word <i>stress</i> and what it means to you. If we
ask a group of people to take part in this
exercise, the list of words produced usually
has three key characteristics.


1. Most of the words or phrases are
expressed in negative terms. That is, we tend
to perceive stress as something bad or
unwanted. For example, words or phrases
such as "depression," "feeling out of
control," "overworked," "migraine or
headache," "time pressure," "panic attack,"
"anxiety," "unable to sleep," and "tearful"
typically appear on such lists to express
thoughts and feelings about the concept of
stress. Consistently, stress appears to be a
pessimistic experience, and this reinforces the
general view that stress is bad. In organizational
life, the stressed employee tends to
be regarded as a problem employee and as
someone who is unable to cope. Thus, the
negative sentiment is intensified. A culture of

[p. <i>35</i>]

2. Our word lists are dominated by
expressions or words that describe symptoms
of exposure to a stressful situation.
For example, stress is described as "feeling
anxious," "depressed," or having a headache
or panic attacks because the experience
is perceived in terms of feelings and
reactions rather than acknowledging the
cause of symptoms or reactions. This habit
can lead to an incorrect acceptance of blame
and feelings of low self-worth because the
individual has not understood that these
feelings and symptoms are part of the normal
reaction and response to a difficult situation
at work.


3. Lists rarely contain words that
describe the actual source of the stress. We
use the words <i>Stressor</i> or <i>stress agent</i> to
describe the source of stress. In our example
in Point 1 above, "being overworked" and
"time pressures" are workplace stressors.
However, these work conditions and situations
need to be explained in more detail
before we are able to use this information to
effectively manage the perceived stressful
work condition. For example, it is necessary
to know if the perception of being overworked
was due to having too much to do
in the time available, having more to do
than other colleagues engaged in the same
tasks, or having to perform a task that is
too difficult. Each of these situations would
demand a different solution, and so accurate
specification of the stressor is vital.


Although problems are inherent in the
layperson view of stress, these perceptions
actually form the basis of early models of
stress, namely, a response-based model of
job stress and a stimulus-based model of job
stress. These are described below. However,
such models of stress are rather simplistic
and inadequate when trying to understand
the complex nature of stress and the stress
response. A more comprehensive model is
needed for both further research into the
study of stress and guidance in a practical
approach to stress management.


Broad application of the stress concept
to medical, social, and behavioral science
research over the past 60 to 70 years has
also compounded the problem of trying to
find a satisfactory model of job stress. Each
discipline investigated and attempted to
explain stress from its own unique perspective,
and early models of stress reflect this
limitation. In the next sections, the historical
origins and early approaches to the
study of stress are outlined to illustrate how
a contemporary interactive model of stress
evolved. This discussion will be followed by
a description of this model of job stress.


Finally, we will demonstrate how our
understanding of the stress concept has been
further advanced by the introduction of two
additional models of job stress, the personenvironment
fit model and the operational
model.

<b>Response-Based Model of Job Stress</b>

As we have stated, when asked to provide
alternate words to the term <i>stress</i>, associations
tend to be in terms of response-based
meanings that take the form of strain,
tension, or pressure. The layperson readily
identifies with the expressions "being, under

[p. <i>36</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I007&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The origins of response-based definitions
of stress are found in medicine and
are usually viewed from a physiological
perspective. This is a logical stance for a discipline
trained to diagnose and treat symptoms,
but not necessarily the cause of the
condition. For example, John Locke, the
17th-century physician and philosopher,
proposed that intellectual function, emotions,
muscle movement, and the behavior
of internal organs were the product of sensory
experiences processed by the brain.
From these early notions, the study of stress
from a physiological perspective developed.
Links were established between life experiences,
emotions, and the importance of
hormone and chemical actions in the body.


Whereas Claude Bernard proposed that
emotional stress was the cause of ischemic
heart disease as early as 1860, Osler (1910)
connected the high incidence of angina
pectoris among Jewish businessmen with
their hectic pace of life. In the 1930s,
psychoanalyst Franz Alexander and physician
Frances Dunbar reported on the relationship
between personality patterns and constitutional
tendencies to certain organic disorders.
Thus, they described the psychosomatic
theory of disease (Warshaw, 1979). Claude
Bernard was the first person to suggest that
the internal environment of a living organism
must remain fairly constant despite
exposure to external changes. This concept
of stability or balance was later developed
and called <i>homeostasis</i> by Walter Cannon
(1935). In systems theory, this would
become known as dynamic equilibrium,
whereby the coordination of physiological
processes maintains a steady state within
the organism. The theory states that natural
homeostatic mechanisms normally maintain
a state of resistance but are not able to cope
with unusually heavy demands. Under
homeostatic principles, it is acknowledged
that there is a finite supply in meet demand.


The earliest report of a systematic study
on the relationship between life events and
bodily responses is probably attributed to
Wolf and Wolff (see McLen:, 1979). Their

[p. <i>37</i>]

However, it is the work of Hans Selye
in the 1930s and 1940s that really marked
the beginning of a response-based approach
to the study of stress. In 1936, Selye introduced
the concept of stress-related illness
in terms of a general adaptation syndrome
known as GAS. He suggested that "stress
is the non-specific response of the body to
any demand made upon it ... and that all
patients, whatever the disease, looked and
felt sick" (Selye, 1936, p. 32). This general
malaise was characterized by loss of motivation,
appetite, weight, and strength. Early
experimentation was with animals, and
Selye was able to demonstrate internal physical
degeneration and deterioration as a
result of exposure to a wide variety of
stimuli that he called "stress." According to
Selye, stress is the lowest common denominator
in the organism's reaction to every
conceivable kind of stressor exposure, challenge,
and demand. Selye used the word <i>stress</i>
as an abstraction to mean the nonspecific
features of a reaction rather than the entire
reaction. Also, Selye (1956) stated that,
"The apparent specificity of diseases of
adaptation is ascribed to conditioning factors
such as genetic predisposition, gender,
learning experiences and diet, etc." (p. 127).
Therefore, the response to stress was deemed
to be invariant to the nature of the stressor
and followed a universal pattern. It is a
biological concept described as the syndrome
of "just being sick."


Three stages of response were described
within the GAS (see Figure 3.2). The alarm
reaction is the immediate psychophysiological
response, and at this time of initial shock,
our resistance to the stressor is lowered. After
the initial shock phase, the countershock
phase can be observed, and resistance levels
begin to increase. At this time, our defense
mechanisms are activated, forming the reaction
known as the fight-or-flight response
(Cannon, 1935).


The fight-or-flight response prepares
our body to take action. Increased sympathetic
activity results in the secretion of
catecholamines that make the body ready to
act. Internal physiological changes initiated
by hormones provide energy from the
metabolism of fat and glucose. This causes
increased delivery of oxygen (another
energy source) to muscles through an
increased number of red blood cells in the
circulation, increased blood flow to the
muscles, and reduced blood flow through
the skin and the gut. So, our breathing
becomes more rapid, our heart beats faster,
and our blood pressure increases. The spleen
contracts, and blood supplies are redirected
from the skin and viscera to provide an
improved blood supply to the brain and
skeletal muscles. Glucose stored as glycogen
in the liver is released to provide energy
for muscular action; blood coagulation
processes become enhanced, and the supply
of blood lymphocytes is increased to

Table 3.1 illustrates the physiological
changes experienced when we are in the alarm
stage of the stress response and explains the
effects we experience in response to stress. In
summary, this is the result of
<table>

• The release of adrenal hormones and
free fatty acids


• Lipid changes, for example, in cholesterol
and triglyceride levels


• Changes in various catecholamines,
such as thyroxin in urine and blood


Thus, the actions of adrenaline, noradrenaline,
and cortisol combine to produce
the reaction we know as the fight-or-flight
stress response.


In evolutionary terms, stress and the
stress response are good for us and necessary
for the development of our society. Indeed,
social Darwinism has been defined as the
"promotion of the fittest," assuming that
the individual survives the rat race
in the first place (McCloy, 1995). The
response to stress was meant to be both adaptive
and vital for survival. In the past, we had
simple choices to make. That is, either stand
and fight an enemy, or run away from a
threatening and potentially dangerous situation.
However, in contemporary society, we
face a dilemma because rarely are these
options appropriate behaviors in the workplace.
In the work environment, there is no
opportunity to indulge in physical action and
thereby dissipate the physiological effects
that become dominant and can cause distress.
We cannot physically fight to escape workplace
stress, nor can we run from a situation
without losing face. Therefore, our bodies are
continually primed to take actions that we
are denied. Because many of us also lead
increasingly sedentary lives at work and at
home, we are denied both the aggression
release and the physical activity necessary to
quickly remove the build up of hormone and
chemical secretions. Fats released to fuel muscle
actions are not used, and so we have elevated
blood lipids. The fat deposits that are
not used are likely to be stored on the lining
of our arteries. This means that our blood
pressure increases as the heart works harder
to pump blood around the body through
smaller capillary openings. It a clot breaks
away from the lining of an artery and finds
its way to the brain or heart, it will cause
a stroke or heart attack (thrombosis).

In addition to diseases of the heart, we
are also likely to suffer from ulcers, troubles
with the gastrointestinal tract, asthma, colds
and flu, and various skin conditions such as
psoriasis, caused by exposure to mismanaged
stress. These problems can be exacerbated
because we often resort to using
maladaptive coping strategies in response to
stress rather than adaptive, positive stress
management techniques (this issue will be
discussed in more detail later in the chapter).


In the third phase of the GAS, we
observe resistance to a continued stressor,
and where the adaptation response and/or
return to equilibrium replaces the alarm
reaction. If the alarm reaction is elicited too
intensely or too frequently over an extended
period of time, the energy required for
adaptation becomes depleted, and the final
stage of exhaustion, collapse, or death occurs.
Resistance cannot continue indefinitely, even
when given sufficient energy, because, as

[p. <i>40</i>]

Although the nonspecificity concept of
stress-related illness and the GAS model
had far-reaching influence and a significant
impact on our understanding of stress, it
has been challenged. Research indicates that
responses to stimuli do not always follow the
same pattern. They are, in fact, stimulusspecific
and dependent on the type of hormonal
secretion. We now understand that
differing perceptions of a stress agent result
in different patterns of neuroendocrine activation.
For example, a challenge that is met
with feelings of being in control and enthusiasm,
and is handled easily and successfully,
elicits noradrenaline and an increase in levels
of testosterone. However, with increasing
fear or anxiety, we move from active coping
to passive acceptance that is characterized
by increases in adrenaline, prolactin, rennin,
and free fatty acids. Cortisol is needed to sustain
the response in such situations and as the
degree of distress grows. Therefore, anxietyproducing
situations seem to be associated
with the secretion of adrenaline (e.g., waiting
for an appointment with the dentist, or sitting
and waiting for a written examination to
commence). Response to this type of experience
produces the feelings of fear and dread
that make us want to just run away from
the situation. In response to aggression or
challenge-producing events, however, noradrenaline
is released. These situations stir
feelings of elation and excitement as we
prepare to fight or take the plunge of the
parachute skydive or bungee jump.


However, the GAS model makes no
attempt to address the issue of psychological
response to events, or that response to a
potential threat may, in turn, become the
stimulus for a different response. The
framework of the GAS can explain our
response to certain stressors, such as the
physical effects of heat and cold, but it is
not adequate to explain response to psychosocial
stress (Christian &amp; Lolas, 1985).


Kagan and Levi (1975) extended the
response-based model of stress to incorporate
psychosocial stimuli as causal factors
in stress-related illness. Response to stress
is viewed as the product of an interaction
between the stimulus and the psychobiological
program of the individual; that is, genetic
predisposition and experience or learning.
The term <i>interaction</i> is used in this instance
to mean a response that follows a particular
pattern. Because Kagan and Levi's model
also incorporates the concept of feedback, it
cannot be considered a simple stimulusresponse
model of stress.


An additional problem associated with
a response-based model is that stress is
recognized as a generic term that subsumes a
large variety of manifestations (Pearlin,
Lieberman, Menaghan, &amp; Mullan, 1981).
Disagreement exists about the real manifestation
of stress and the level in the organism
or system that most clearly reflects the
response. For example, Pearlin et al. ask if
the response is in the single cell, in an organ,
or throughout the entire organism; is it
biochemical, physiological, or emotional
functioning? Is it at the endocrine, immunological,
metabolic, or cardiovascular level,
or in particular diseases, either physical or
psychological? The answers to these questions
are not simple because the findings
of replication research are likely to be confounded.
Individuals adapt to a potential
source of stress, and so response will vary
over time (e.g., in the assessment of noise on
hearing and performance).


Levi (1998) suggested that in seeking to
define stress, Selye actually intended to
choose an analogy from engineering. The

[p. <i>41</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I010&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />
<b>A Stimulus-Based Model of Job Stress</b>

Historically, this approach, which links
health and disease to certain conditions in
the external environment, can be traced
back to Hippocrates (5th century BC).
Hippocratic physicians believed that the
external environment conditions characteristics
of health and disease (Goodell, Wolf, &amp;
Rogers, 1986). The stimulus-based psychological
model of stress has its roots in physics
and engineering, the analogy being that
stress can be defined as an external force
that results in a demand or load reaction that
causes distortion. Both organic and inorganic
substances have tolerance levels that, if
exceeded, result in temporary or permanent
damage. Indeed, it is also suggested that the
word <i>stress</i> derives from the Latin word
<i>stringere</i>, which means "to bind tight."


The aphorism, "it is the straw that
breaks the camel's back," is a view consistent
with a stimulus-based model of stress.
An individual is bombarded with stimuli in
the environment, but just one more, apparently
minor or innocuous event can alter the
balance between the ability to cope with
demand and a breakdown in coping and of
the system itself. Figure 3.3 illustrates this
model of stress, which treats a potential
Stressor as an independent variable that will
cause a certain effect (i.e., an outcome or
symptom).


Rapid industrialization provided an
impetus for the increasing popularity of
this particular model of stress. Much of the
early research into blue-collar stress at work

[p. <i>42</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I011&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

However, it was acknowledged that the
relationship between a source of stress and
the outcome is not always linear. This
phenomenon can be understood in terms of
a simple inverted "U" model of stress and
performance (see Figure 3.4). It explains
how response to a stimulus cannot be
viewed or measured in simple linear terms.
Thus, a certain level of arousal (i.e., a stimulus)
is needed for optimal performance. In
an optimal state, we feel creative, calm, and
highly motivated to do the job well. When
the level of arousal exceeds our ability to
meet the demand placed upon us, we experience
feelings of burnout, exhaustion, and,
ultimately, collapse. Likewise, if we do not
feel challenged or stimulated by the job, or
we do not believe that our contribution is
valued, we may experience apathy, boredom,
a poor morale, and a lack of self-worth.
This is called "rust-out" and is the
opposite of burnout. Ultimately, such individuals
may "vote with their feet" by staying
away from work, complaining that
they are sick of the job rather than physically
unwell. New technology that leads to
the increasing automation of industry can
lead to the simplification of work. The
repetitive, simple, short-cycle jobs that are a
product of automation can cause qualitative
underload at work. Although the hectic
pace at work can create stress, work that is
dull and monotonous can lead to rust-out,
which is also detrimental to the individual's
physical and psychological well-being if his
or her job expectations are not met. This
highlights a major weakness of the simple
stimulus-response model of job stress,
because stress needed to be defind in terms
of the imbalance between the perceived
demand from the environment and the
individual's perceived resources to meet

[p. <i>43</i>]

Thus, the restricted usefulness of an
engineering or physical model of stress
became clear when it was realized that
purely objective measures of environmental
conditions were inadequate and unable
to explain an observed response to stress.
Individual differences, including variability
in tolerance levels, personality traits, past
experiences (learning and training), needs,
wants, and expectations account for the fact
that two individuals, exposed to exactly the
same situation, might react in completely
different ways. In fact, Lazarus (1966) stated
that no objective criterion was good enough
to describe a situation as stressful, and only
the individual experiencing the event could
do this. It implies that objective measure
of, for example, the concept of "boring" is
probably meaningless. Only the description
of the job as boring as defined by the
incumbent is relevant in understanding the
psychological state and stress condition of
that individual.


<b><i>Using Simple Models of Job
Stress in the Organization</i></b>


Although a stimulus-based model of job
stress has limitations, its use has appeal in
organizations seeking to identify common
Stressor themes or patterns of stress that
might affect the majority of the workforce.
Thus, the strategy is to manage the Stressor
situation without taking into account the
needs and differences of individual job
incumbents. This means that the work environment
and job conditions are designed
around a notion of average conditions for
the average employee. Other organizations
favor a response-based model to guide a
stress management program. They view the
problem of stress as something inherent to
the person. This allows the organization to
transfer the responsibility to the individual
employee. Typically, this organization will
introduce a program that, in good faith,
aims to help the employee cope with the
Stressor situation, but usually does nothing
to actually remove or eliminate the source
of stress itself.


Both models have limitations and
weaknesses, and these have been magnified
by the changing nature of the workplace
and society itself. Industrialization brought
problems associated with physical and task-related
sources of strain and pressure. Poor
working conditions caused diseases such
as tuberculosis and pneumonia, which often
led to early death. Legislation regarding
health and safety requirements in the workplace
resolved many of these unsatisfactory
conditions. However, contemporary industrialization
and new technology have introduced
different problems and new forms of
illness and injury. These include upper body
limb disorder, known as repetitive strain
injury, and psychological ill-health problems,
including problems associated with
sick building syndrome. In addition, changing
expectations of quality of life and worklife
balance have brought a new meaning to
the concept of health. It means not only an
absence of disease or infirmity, but also a
satisfactory state of physical, mental, and
social well-being (WHO, 1984). This broad
definition of well-being is described as a
dynamic state of mind, characterized by
reasonable harmony between a worker's
ability, needs, expectations, environmental
demands, and opportunities (Levi, 1987).


In reality, a model of job stress that seeks
to explain and guide stress management
practice in contemporary organizations
cannot be found in the simple models of job
stress already described. An interactive or
transactional model of stress, which considers
the Stressor source, the perception of the

[p. <i>44</i>]
<b>An Interactive Model of Job Stress</b>

In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a move
away from simple product models of stress
toward more ecologically valid models.
These ecological models attempted to
account for both the external Stressor and
the body's response, and also to emphasize
the importance of the transactional or interactionist
dimension. Thus, an <i>interactive</i>
model of stress incorporates both the
response-based and the stimulus-based
models of stress, and the concept of cognitive
appraisal plays a central role in the stress
response of the individual.


Such models suggest that sources of
stress arising from workplace conditions
and situations are mediated through perception,
appraisal, and experience. Individual
determinants of this appraisal and reaction
process are described as psychobiological
programming. This includes all the genetic
factors and earlier environmental influences
that shape personality, attitudes, customs,
and values. In addition, the process is modified
by interacting variables such as social
support and learned coping strategies.
Together, these will determine the physiological,
emotional, and behavioral reaction
mechanisms that, under certain circumstances,
lead to precursors of disease or disease
itself. Whereas predisposing interacting
variables may promote this chain of events,
other interacting factors will counteract
potentially damaging outcomes. In simple
terms, for example, we might describe this
as having an adequate stress coping mechanism.
Most importantly, the sequence is not
a one-way process but constitutes part of
a cybernetic system with multiple and continuous
feedback (Kagan &amp; Levi, 1975).
Essentially, it is a dynamic system in which
stress (the stress agent) is inevitable, but distress
or strain is not. Ecological models also
represent the relationship between the individual
and the environment as dynamic in
nature, and the person is acknowledged as
entering a transaction or interacting with
the environment.


Cognitive appraisal and reappraisal are
incorporated into a feedback circuit in an
interactive model of stress. The objective is
to minimize the distress experienced and to
maximize any potential benefits. Davies and
Underwood (2000) argue for a three-factor
model of coping, namely, the management
of emotional responses, problem solving,
and avoidance. However, they also point
out, "It should be remembered that stress is
a natural process that has evolved to offer
adaptive benefits. It is only when coping
strategies fail to accrue benefits that we
should conceive stress as detrimental to an
individual" (p. 480).


Figure 3.5 provides an illustration of
the way in which a situation is perceived
and how a response is subsequently modified
by individual differences. In summary,
we can observe that five key characteristics
are associated with an interactive model of
job stress.


<i>Cognitive Appraisal</i>. Stress is regarded
as a subjective experience contingent upon
the perception of a situation or event.
Individuals will appraise the relevance of an
external event to their own situation. This is
known as primary appraisal. It means
that "stress is not simply out there in the
environment" (Lazarus, 1966, p. 466). As
Shakespeare's Hamlet says, "There is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes
it so" (Act II, scene ii). Secondary appraisal

[p. <i>45</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I012&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

<i>Experience</i>. The way a situation or
event is perceived depends upon familiarity
with the situation, previous exposure to
the event, learning, education, and training
(i.e., the individual's actual ability). Related
to this is the concept of success or failure
in coping with the demand on previous
occasions. Therefore, conditioning and reinforcement
are an important part of an interactive
model of stress.


<i>Demand</i>. Pressure or demand is the
product of actual demands, perceived
demands, actual ability, and perceived
ability to meet that demand. Needs, desires,
and the immediate level of arousal all will
influence the way in which a demand is
perceived.


<i>Interpersonal Influence</i>. A potential
source of stress is not perceived in a social
vacuum. The presence or absence of other
people or work colleagues will influence our
perception of stress. Thus, background and
situational factors will influence the subjective
experience of stress, our response, and
the coping behavior used. The presence or
absence of other people can have both a
positive and a negative influence. For
example, the presence of work colleagues
can be a source of distraction, irritation, or
unwanted arousal. Conversely, the presence
of work colleagues can also provide a support
network that helps to boost confidence
and self-esteem, provide confirmation of
values, and provide a sense of personal identity
and self-worth. Through the process of
vicarious learning, increased awareness and
an understanding of potential consequences
can also be gained.


<i>A State of Stress</i>. This is acknowledged
as an imbalance or mismatch between the
perceived demand and the perception of
one's ability to meet that demand. The processes
that follow are the coping process
and the consequences of the coping strategy
applied. Therefore, the importance of feedback
at all levels is specified in this model
of stress. Successful coping restores any

[p. <i>46</i>]

Within this model of stress, an accident
at work can be both a short-term and a
long-term manifestation of exposure to
stress (having both direct and indirect
impact on behavior). McGrath (1976) states
that a source of stress must be perceived and
interpreted by the individual. However, it is
also necessary to perceive that the potential
consequences of successful coping are more
desirable than the expected consequences of
leaving a situation unaltered. For example,
an individual who chooses to use palliatives
as a coping strategy (perhaps as an escape
from reality) views this type of short-term,
immediate response as less costly or more
personally desirable than trying to alter the
demand. Of course, it might not be possible
for the individual to actually alter the
demand at a personal level. This could happen,
for example, if an individual is forced
to work permanent night shifts because no
alternative work schedule is available to
him or her.


In summary, an interactive model of
stress acknowledges that situations are not
inherently stressful, but are potentially stressful,
and it is necessary to take account of the

One example of an interactive model of
stress is known as the person-environment
fit approach to understanding stress (Cooper,
1981; French &amp; Caplan, 1973).

<b>Person-Environment Fit Model of Job Stress</b>

Contemporary theories of stress recognize
the importance of both the person and the
environment in understanding the consequences
of exposure to a stress agent. Person
constructs relevant to our understanding of
the nature of stress include type A behavior
(Friedman &amp; Rosenman, 1959) and locus of
control (Rotter, 1966). The impact of environment
has been researched in terms of
constructs such as life events (Holmes &amp;
Rahe, 1967), daily hassles (DeLongis, Coyne,
Dakof, Folkman, &amp; Lazarus, 1982), and
role overload and underload (French &amp;
Caplan, 1973). However, a dual emphasis
on both person and environment is characteristic
of an interactive perspective in
understanding the nature of stress. In this
ecological model of job stress, the person is
seen to interact with the environment.
Implicit in this is the notion that the person
and the environment determine behavior,
attitudes, and well-being jointly, and that
stress arises from lack of fit between the
person and the environment. The person-environment
(P-E) fit theory and model of job
stress have been expounded and developed

[p. <i>47</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I013&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The exponents of P-E fit theory suggest
that stress does not arise from the person or
the environment separately but from a lack
of fit with one another. There are three key
distinctions to acknowledge within the P-E
fit theory of stress.


1. Person and environment are two
separate entities.


2. Both person and environment are
defined in <i>subjective</i> and <i>objective</i>
terms.


• Objective person refers to the
attributes of the person, as they
actually exist.


• Subjective person refers to the
person's perceptions of his or her
attributes, such as self-identity
and self-concept.


• Objective environment refers to the
physical and social situations and
events, as they exist independent of
the individual's perceptions.


• Subjective environment refers to
the events and situations as
encountered and perceived by the
individual (Edwards, Caplan, &amp;
Van Harrison, 1998).


Harrison (1978) suggests that the objective
person and environment are causally
related to their subjective counterparts, but
these relationships are imperfect because of
perceptual distortions. Limited human information-processing
capabilities, denial, and
repression cause perceptual distortion. Also,
we need to acknowledge that an organizational
structure and climate can limit access
to objective information (Harrison, 1978).
However, cognitive appraisal of both objective
and subjective environment may be
distorted by irrational beliefs and common
distortions that create faulty thinking. These
include the following:

[p. <i>48</i>]

• <i>Thinking in Black-and-White Terms</i>.
This concept involves putting all our experiences
into one of two opposite categories
so that everything is either black or white,
with no room for anything in between. For
example, the belief that attending Meeting
X is always a good experience and attending
Meeting Y is always a bad experience
can lead us to behave and perform inappropriately
in one or both situations.


• <i>Overgeneralizing From One Situation
to Another</i>. This means drawing conclusions
from one or two isolated events and
assuming that those same conclusions can be
applied to all situations. For example, your
train journey from Manchester to London
always arrives on time. Making plans on the
assumption that this will be the situation on
a rail journey from London to Cardiff can
create stress when this thinking is found to
be faulty because the train arrives late and
an important meeting is missed.


• <i>Jumping to Conclusions</i>. This
means drawing a conclusion when there is
no appropriate evidence or facts to justify
it, or even when the facts suggest something
totally different. For example,
because it did not snow in January, you
conclude that winter is over. You drain the
antifreeze from the engine in your car,
even though snow fell in April the previous
year.


• <i>Ignoring Important Details</i>. This
involves focusing on a particular detail
taken out of context and ignoring the more
important aspects of the situation. For
example, a colleague has been promoted.
Because you have both worked in the
department for the same length of time, you
are feeling distressed and depressed because
you feel that you have been passed over for
promotion. However, you have chosen to
ignore the fact that the promoted colleague
has attended evening classes for the past
2 years to obtain the necessary qualification
for promotion.


• <i>Exaggerating the Importance of
Things</i>. This means that either you pretend
that an event or thing is of no importance
when, in reality, it is vital, or you believe
that something is vital when, in fact, it is
quite trivial and insignificant. For example,
the boss has asked to see you about one of
your projects. Automatically assuming that
everything is fine and going to the meeting
unprepared to discuss the project can create
problems in just the same way as assuming
that you must have done something wrong
and spending the day becoming more frantic,
anxious, and unable to work. Both are
distortions that can lead to dysfunctional
behavior because stress arises from how we
perceive a situation and our thoughts and
feelings about it.


• <i>Taking Things Personally</i>. This is the
tendency to believe that things happening
around us are somehow related to us in an
important way, even when there is no real
evidence for this. For example, you pass a
colleague in the building at work and he or
she appears not to notice you. You interpret
this to mean that he or she dislikes you or is
avoiding you.


Likewise, cognitive appraisal of both
objective and subjective person may be
distorted by the perceptual distortion and
irrational beliefs described above. This is
described as a lack of accuracy in self-assessment.
For example, your belief that the
boss does not like you may cause you to
accept this as the reason for your failure to be
promoted. In fact, it is due to your laziness or
lack of motivation, because, unlike other
colleagues, you did not attempt to gain the
business qualifications needed for further
promotion.


3. Two types of fit are assumed in the
P-E fit model of stress.

[p. <i>49</i>]

The first type of fit describes fit or misfit
between the demands of the environment
and the abilities of the person. Demands
include, for example, role responsibilities,
and qualitative and quantitative task load
or underload. Abilities of the individual
might include experience, level of skill,
training, stamina, and dexterity. The second
type of fit refers to the match or fit between
the needs, wants, and desires of the person
and the degree to which the environment
meets these needs. It is acknowledged that
needs are determined by innate biological
and psychological processes and the
product of learning and socialization. The
environment can meet the needs of the individual
by providing extrinsic and intrinsic
resources and rewards such as food, shelter,
money, social interaction, and the opportunity
to achieve (Harrison, 1978).


Four classifications of misfit between
person and environment are possible.


1. <i>Objective P-E fit</i>--the fit between the
objective person and the objective
environment


2. <i>Subjective P-E fit</i>--the fit between
the subjective person and the subjective
environment


3. <i>Contact with reality</i>--the degree to
which the subjective environment
is consistent with the objective
environment


4. <i>Accuracy of self-assessment</i>--the
match between the objective person
and the subjective person


Although lack of discrepancy between
person and environment fit is a requirement
for good mental health, under certain con
disengagement from the objective
aspects of a situation or the self may
dampen anxiety and facilitate adaptation,
thus promoting mental health (Lazarus,
1983). Indeed, present wisdom suggests that
subjective P-E fit is the critical pathway
to mental health and other dimensions of
well-being.


Therefore, stress arises when the perceived
environment does not provide adequate
supplies to meet the person's perceived
needs, or the perceived abilities of the person
fail to meet the perceived demands of the
work environment. Thus, stress is defined in
terms of the degree of perceived goodness
of fit between person and environment.
Subjective P-E misfit leads to physical,
psychological, and behavioral strain, defined
as deviation from normal functioning
(Harrison, 1978), whereas good fit produces
positive health and well-being. Judgment of
threat and lack of fit, that is, stress, leads
to the employment of one or more coping
strategies and provides impetus for change.
Outcomes are then fed back into the perception
of fit. For example, perceived work overload
and having too much to do may prompt
the employee to seek help in the form of
assertiveness training, because the ability to
be assertive and say no to increased demand
in the form of more work is a way of reducing
the strain between a perceived demand
in the environment and the perceived ability
of that person to meet that demand. This is
described as adaptive coping. However, as
we have noted, the individual may engage in
maladaptive coping by using certain defense
mechanisms such as denial, repression, or
projection. This is an attempt to enhance subjective
P-E fit through the process of cognitive
distortion of the attributes of either the person
or the environment. Denial of the experience
of strain is also a way of coping with the
stress associated with perceived misfit. This
characteristic is typical of type A corona1 y
prone behavior, in which an individual is
likely to deny both physical and psychological
strain when working under the pressure
of a high workload.

[p. <i>50</i>]

Therefore, fit is assessed in terms of the
desired and actual levels of various job conditions.
The main weakness of this model
is that it infers some static situation; in reality,
response to stress is a dynamic process.
However, the model is useful when certain
personality traits are relatively stable. For
example, Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, and
Rosenthal (1964) found that introverts
under stress from role conflict will tend
to reduce contact with other people and
further irritate work colleagues by appearing
to be too independent. Role senders,
attempting to define the role, will increase
their efforts, thereby adding to the strain.
This means that the introvert's coping strategy
of defensive withdrawal is, in effect,
maladaptive. An understanding of such differences
between introverts and extroverts
can help to avoid potentially stressful interpersonal
conflict situations. Kahn et al. also
noted that rigid personality types tend to
avoid conflict. They rely on compulsive
work habits and show increased dependence
on authority figures when under
threat. Flexible people, however, are more
likely to respond to a conflict situation by
complying with work demands and seeking
support from peers and subordinates. This
compliance strategy can lead to work overload
problems. Also, reliance on those of
equal or lower status does not help to
resolve the stressor situation because it is
often the boss or superior who sets the work
expectation that is the source of stress.
Thus, the rigid and the flexible personality
types create very different problems in the
workplace in response to stress and ultimately
may be more suited to some work
environments more than others.


<b><i>Other Interactive Models of Job Stress</i></b>


Siegrist (1997) suggests that a theoretical
concept is needed to identify the "toxic"
components of stressful experiences at
work. To understand the response to stress,
we need to apply an interactive model of
stress and consider the interaction between
work characteristics and the individual. For
example, the demand-control model of work
stress proposed by Karasek and Theorell
(1990) suggests that we can understand
response to job demands only if we also take
into account the individual's perceptions of
control in the workplace. According to this
model, the combined effect of high job
demand and low job control (low decision
latitude at work, low skill discretion) creates
recurrent negative emotions and associated
physiological stress reactions that, in the
long term, affect health adversely, including
the cardiovascular system (Siegrist, 1997).
Social support from both work colleagues
and supervisors will also moderate the
impact of job demand and job control, and
this has been added to the demand-control
model of stress.


The effort-reward imbalance model
proposed by Siegrist (1997) offers another
explanation of how an individual copes
with the demands of work. This concept
claims that the same types of tasks may
produce quite different psychological and
physiological reactions depending on the
person's way of coping with a demand.
Two sources of high effort are defined.
<i>Extrinsic effort</i> refers to demands and
obligations, and <i>intrinsic effort</i> refers to the
motivations of the individual. Siegrist states,
<blockquote>
<p>
Stressful experience associated with high
effort results from the absence of an
appropriate reward, either in terms of
esteem, money, career opportunities and
job security. Having a demanding but
unstable job, achieving at high level without
being offered promotion prospects.
or receiving an inadequate wage in comparison
to one's efforts or qualifications,
are examples of "toxic" psych osocial

<b><i>A View of Stress--Implications for
Managing Stress in the Workplace</i></b>


As we have seen, a variety of models
have been offered in an attempt to increase
our understanding of the nature of stress.
The most recent transactional models of
stress are indicative of the complexity of
the concept. In reality, models tend to oversimplify
the problem to the extent that the
issue of stress can seem to become trivialized.
As Schuler (1980) says, "It is too all
encompassing a phenomenon, too large to
investigate" (p. 185). This has not deterred
interest in the topic, nor has the interest
always been positive. Incorrect usage of the
word <i>stress</i> is common, and it is used interchangeably
to refer to a state or condition,
a symptom, or the cause of a state or symptom.
Defining the word <i>stress</i> is problematic,
if, indeed, the word even exists. In
certain quarters, people ask if it should be
used at all, or if it is a helpful term to
describe work conditions. <i>Stress, pressure</i>,
and <i>strain</i> are used interchangeably to
describe feelings, emotions, or situations.
The layperson seems quite able to identify
with the concept of stress and has an
appetite to know more. The press and
media serve this need too eagerly, and without
a doubt, certain individuals hope to
make a quick profit from "being stressed"
at work. What is really needed is action and
encouragement to prevent and manage
positively the strains and pressures that are
an inevitable part of modern-day living and
working.


So, it is vital that we apply a model of
job stress that embraces the view that <i>not all
stress is bad</i>. Hans Selye, the acknowledged
father of stress research, said that the only
person without stress was a dead person
(Selye, 1983). By this, Selye meant that stress
is an inevitable part of being alive and
should be viewed as stimulation to growth
and development. Hans Selye used the word
<i>stress</i> to describe a state of arousal in the
nervous system. So, it is <i>any</i> stimulus, event,
or demand affecting the sensory nervous
system. A state of stress exists when there is
unwanted pressure. It is manifest when we
feel that a situation is out of our control or
when we feel unable to cope with an event.
Stress is a subjective experience--it is in the
eye of the beholder. An understanding of
this explains why, in a given situation, one
person might be highly distressed, whereas
another seems to prosper and thrive.


In organizational life, it is likely that we
are now denied a natural outlet and expression
of the stress response yet are physiologically
primed to take actions that are
inappropriate. The sedentary nature of work
exacerbates this situation. Although our
response to stress is, in the first instance,
physiological, complex emotional and
behavioral reactions also take place. These
can lead to potentially damaging health outcomes.
Understanding the nature of stress in
these terms helps us to think positively and
proactively about stress instead of taking a
defensive, self-blaming stance. It implies that
each of us, at various times, will be vulnerable
to stress. Therefore, it is essential that
any model of stress embrace This notion and
include the issue of coping and coping sryle
in response to arousal. The P-E fit model of
stress suggests that coping strategies are put
into place to overcome a perceived threat.

[p. <i>52</i>]

<b><i>Adaptive Versus Maladaptive
Ways of Coping With Stress</i></b>


It is essential that we manage a potentially
stressful situation in an active and
positive manner, without resorting to
maladaptive ways of coping. Maladaptive
coping strategies include
<table>

<p>
1. Excessive use of alcohol or nicotine

Maladaptive coping exacerbates the
stress problem and can become the source
of stress itself. For example, we consume
alcohol because we believe it gives us confidence
or aids sleep or relaxation; we drink
lots of strong coffee to gain the "buzz"
necessary to sustain long hours of working
without a break; we smoke cigarettes to
calm our nerves or take the place of meals
that we skip because of time pressures; we
use various pills and potions to bring sleep
or to pep ourselves up; and we eat comfort
foods with low or poor nutritional value.
These forms of coping render us less fit to
cope and, in the long term, actually become
the source of stress, when addiction aggravates
the problem. This explains why we
insist that it is mismanaged stress that is
damaging in its consequences.


<b><i>An Operational Model of Job Stress</i></b>


A working model of the dynamics of
stress proposed by Cooper and Marshall
(1978) has been used widely within organizations
to guide stress management initiatives.
It has become a framework for
conducting a stress audit and a model for a
holistic, organizational approach to the
management of stress (see Figure 3.7).


Consistent with an interactive approach
to stress, a successful approach to the
management of stress must consider three
key elements.


1. The source of stress or stress agent


2. Individual differences in response to
stress


3. Outcomes or symptoms of exposure
to stress for both the organization
and individual

[p. <i>53</i>]

Evidence from a significant body of
research suggests that five major categories
of job stress can be identified. These are
illustrated in Figure 3.7. The model includes
a sixth stressor classification to take account
of the home-work interface of the employee.
Sources of stress include the following:
<table>
<tr><td>
<p>
1. <i>Stress in the job itself</i>--includes
workload conditions, the physical
work environment, hours of working,
decision-making latitude, and so on
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
2. <i>Role-based stress</i>--includes stressors
such as role conflict, role ambiguity,
and job responsibility
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
3. <i>Stress due to the changing nature of
relationships with other people at
work</i>--includes relationships with
managers, supervisors, subordinates,
and coworkers
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
4. <i>Career stress</i>--associated with the
lack of opportunity for career
development and promotion, as well
as job insecurity
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

To understand a response to a source of
stress, it is necessary to take account of the
individual and all the differences that interact
to modify that response. This is known
as the person factor, and included in this are
the many personality traits, characteristics,

[p. <i>54</i>]
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000284022-I015&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

The complexity of understanding stress
in terms of individual differences is illustrated
in Table 3.2. Beehr and Newman
( 1978 ) describe Job stress and employee
health in terms of a facet analysis model.
This includes environmental, personal, and
process facets; human and organizational

[p. <i>55</i>]

These are the personal conditioning
variables that are important to the individual's
perception of the work environment.
The long list explains the diversity of individual
differences observed in response to
a source of stress, and so individual vulnerability
to stress is dependent on a large
number of complex and interacting factors.
Therefore, dealing with stress in the workplace
is a twofold process of understanding
the potential stressors that might exist to
cause harm, and acknowledging the attributes
of the individual that will mediate
appraisal and any subsequent outcomes.


The operational model of job stress
illustrated in Figure 3.7 also indicates that
we need to consider both individual and
organizational symptoms or outcomes of
exposure to stress. Indeed, costs to society
itself should not be ignored by responsible
corporations.


A wide variety of individual symptoms
of stress, and the use of maladaptive coping
strategies, can lead to numerous physical
and psychological health problems, including
heart disease, certain cancers, depressive
disorders, and gastrointestinal problems. In
addition, we need to acknowledge the organizational
and social problems associated
with, for example, alcoholism, obesity,
poor physical condition, psychoses, neuroses,
and personality disorders. Therefore,
the real bottom line for an organization
must include the high business costs of
absence, labor turnover, unsatisfactory
industrial relations, poor job performance,
and frequent and severe accidents. So, in
addition to identifying sources of stress and
understanding individual differences in
response to stress, it is necessary to understand
and measure the consequences and
costs of stress to the individual and the
organization. This information is essential if
individuals are required to justify and rationalize
the need for stress management
interventions. It is also vital as part of the
process of evaluation and the calculation of
a cost-benefit analysis.


This model of stress can be used to
guide the steps to successful stress management
programs.


• Have a clear understanding of why
you are implementing the program--
stress management should not be a
flavor-of-the-month activity. The need
for clearly defined objectives and
goals is paramount in gaining the
commitment of the workforce.


• Recognize and measure the benefits to
be gained (i.e., evaluate).


• Take time to understand staff attitudes
to stress management.


• Define clearly and communicate your
plan. Identify who will be involved
and what will happen.


• Acknowledge that stress is a dynamic
process. Stress management is not a
one-off project but should be integrated
into the organization.


• Stress management is everyone's
responsibility--it is not an activity
confined to the health and safety department
or human resources personnel.


• Stress is inevitable; distress is not.


<b><i>Defining Stress</i></b>


As we have stated previously, the successful
management of stress requires us to
state and define clearly what we mean by
stress in the work environment. Examination
of dictionary definitions of stress
reflects their origins and the schools of
thought on the mechanism nnd nature of
stress. For example, in the 17th century,
stress was used to mean "hardship, straits,

[p. <i>56</i>]

More recent dictionary definitions
actually associate stress with disease. For
example, the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i>
(1984), new edition, described stress as
"suffered by managers, etc; subject to continual
stress." Medical dictionaries include
both a response-based and a stimulus-based
approach to stress when providing guidance
on definitions of stress. For example,
<i>Stedman's Medical Dictionary</i> (1982, 24th
ed.) states that stress is
<blockquote>
<p>
1. Reactions of the body to forces of a
deleterious nature, infections, and various
abnormal states that tend to disturb
its normal physiologic equilibrium....
3. The force or pressure applied or exerted
between portions of a body or bodies....
5. A physical or psychological stimulus...
which, when impinging upon an individual,
produces psychological strain or
disequilibrium.
</p>
</blockquote>

5. A physical or psychological stimulus...
which, when impinging upon an individual,
produces psychological strain or
disequilibrium.


The <i>Encyclopaedia and Dictionary of
Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health</i> ( 1978,
2nd ed.) suggests that stress is
<blockquote>
<p>
the sum of all the non-specific biological
phenomena elicited by adverse external
influences including damage and defence.
Stress may be either physical or psychological,
or both. Just as a bridge is structurally
capable of adjusting to certain physical
stresses, the human body and mind are
normally able to adapt to the stresses of
new situations. This ability has definite
limits beyond which continued stress may
cause a breakdown... although this limit
varies from person to person.... For
example, peptic ulcers may result from
prolonged nervous tension in response to
real or imagined stresses in people who
have a predisposition for ulcers.

prolonged nervous tension in response to
real or imagined stresses in people who
have a predisposition for ulcers.


However, within our conceptualization
of stress, a person-environment fit model
also acknowledges that both underload and
overload can be stress agents. Levi (1987)
takes account of this when he describes
stress as a poor fit.


The interaction between, or misfit of, environmental
opportunities and demands, and
individual needs and abilities, and expectations,
elicit reactions. When the fit is bad,
when needs are not being met, or when
abilities are over- or under-taxed, the organism
reacts with various pathogenic mechanisms.
These are cognitive, emotional,
behavioural and/or physiological and under
some conditions of intensity, frequency or
duration, and in the presence or absence of
certain interacting variables, they may lead
to precursors of disease, (p. 9)


This definition is consistent with a contemporary,
interactive approach to the
study of stress. Implicit in Levi's definition
is the view that stress can have both positive
and negative consequences. That is. "Stress
can be a motivator to growth, development
and adaptation; it can be challenge and
variety... it can be the spice of life'' (Selye,
1936, p. 32).

[p. <i>57</i>]

Therefore, a distinction must be made
between stressors that cause distress and
those that result in "eustress" (i.e., a positive
stress response), because stress is
inevitable, distress is not (Quick &amp; Quick,
1984). Beehr and Newman (1978) acknowledge
this and provide our ultimate definition
of job stress:
<blockquote>
<p>
A situation wherein job-elated factors
interact with a worker to change (that is,
disrupt or enhance) his or her psychological
and or physiological condition
such that the person (that is, mind or
body) is forced to deviate from normal
functioning. This definition also serves
to define what we mean by "employee
health"; namely a person's mental and
physical condition. We are referring to
health in its broadest sense--the complete
continuum from superb mental and
physical health all the way to death.
Note that we are not excluding the
possibility of beneficial effects of stress
on health, (p. 670)

<b>Conclusion</b>

Our review of various models of job stress
has guided us in providing an adequate
definition of stress, and it is clear that our
understanding of stress must be in terms of
transaction or interactive process models,
where stress is viewed as a dynamic process
in which time plays a vital role. Models of
stress have been used to explain how occupational
stressors arise from both the work
environment and work conditions, but are
mediated through perceptual appraisal and
experience. Furthermore, stressor-induced
physiological, psychological, and behavioral
mechanisms are activated and can lead
to stress-elated physical and psychological
diseases and a host of social and organizational
problems. Therefore, a dual
approach to the management of stress is
advocated. It means that the organization
and every employee must exercise a joint
duty of care in reducing the mounting costs
associated with stress in the workplace.
