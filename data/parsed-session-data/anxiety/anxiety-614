<b>WHEN MY SON WAS TWO YEARS OLD,</b> his father and I each
bought a ticket to one day of the Austin City Limits Music Festival,
a weekend spree of live music and sweaty fraternity men held in a
large municipal park. Jim wanted to see Cake and Elvis Costello
on Sunday; I wanted to see Old 97's and The Pixies on Saturday.
We would take turns attending the concerts and minding our toddler.
Since mine was the Saturday ticket, it fell to me to chaperone
one of his eighth-grade students, who was reporting on the event
for the school paper. I was delighted to squire her around, give her
journalism advice, and demur on her behalf whenever a joint passed
our way in the crowd. Her mother provided our transportation to
the event, where parking was limited. En route, I had the following
exchange with a friend of their family, a man without children who
was seated on the passenger side of their minivan:


<b>Family Friend:</b> A writer, huh? So what do you write about?


<b>Me:</b> Well, my current project is a memoir of postpartum
depression.


<b>Family Friend:</b> Huh. That's hormonal, right?


<b>Me:</b> Perhaps partially. No one is sure. I'm interested in its

[p. <i>2</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Family Friend:</b> I see. And that's a real thing? I mean, it's in the
<i>DSM?</i>


Indeed, the <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>,
a categorizing system advanced by the American Psychiatric:
Association, places postpartum depression in its Mood Disorders
category, describing it as a major depressive episode with an onset
within twenty-eight days of delivery. Most experts agree that this
definition is too narrow, but it does <i>exist</i>, and thus postpartum
depression is "real." As if millions of parents—mothers and fathers,
biological and adoptive alike—couldn't tell you that.


So before I can tell you my story of motherhood and madness—
before I can tell you about the sleepless nights and dreams of suicide
and the wounds I caused myself—I must address the layers of myth
and mystique surrounding "postpartum depression" as we understand
and experience it. That way, you'll know it's all real.


The myth of postpartum depression (or PPD) is that your life
is peachy and your baby is wonderful, but somehow you can't stop
crying because your hormones went wonky after you gave birth.
Levels of progesterone and estrogen drop after delivery, so maybe
it's like that for some people, but it wasn't for me.


I suspect that when we talk about PPD, we're actually describing
a variety of conditions, one of which may actually be the condition
of motherhood itself. Some maternal depressions are situational in
origin—from exhaustion, from emotional depletion, from being

[p. <i>3</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

So maybe PPD isn't a malfunction of those mercurial female
humors. Maybe it's more like a shitstorm parents endure because
we are tired, frightened, isolated, confused, apparently powerless.
Especially if we live in some stupid suburban family domicile without
a strong community around us; especially if we have learned the
lie that a parent looks into a baby's eyes and somehow knows exactly
what to do.


"When you look into your baby's eyes for the first time, it
will be the happiest day of your life," a relative told me when I was
pregnant.


"You'll look into your baby's eyes and grow your ‘mama spine,’"
someone else said when I was confused about everything that confuses
a new mother: circumcision, vaccinations, early-education
curricula, whether to use cloth or disposable diapers, whether to
tell my doctor to fuck off.


Maybe it's because I didn't get to look into my baby's eyes for
a couple of hours after my caesarean. Then again, when I did I saw
two narrow slits in an angry, red, screaming face. I did, of course,

[p. <i>4</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometime in all this mayhem, I happened to see an episode of
<i>The Ricki Lake Show</i>—yes, really—about PPD. The guests were different
kinds of women: young and urban, thirtysomething and suburban.
All of them believed they were failures at mothering.


"I just know she hates me," a Chicana mother with a fifteen-month-old
insisted. "I only want to have a good relationship with
her." She started crying uncontrollably, literally—the kind of sobbing
where you get the hiccups if you try to talk.


I stopped joggling our son around the living room. Yes. Yes.
That was it exactly. I could look at another person and think logically
about her situation: <i>Of course she doesn't hate you. How could a
fifteen-month-old hate anyone? You care for her. Of course you'll have a
good relationship</i>. But when I turned back to my own child, I too felt
like an abject failure.


"Failure" isn't the right word. Everybody feels like a failure
sometimes, like an impostor in our lives and work. As if a perspicacious
person could look right through the shell of who you are
and see that you really know nothing about veterinary medicine or
accounts receivable or double-crust pies or whatever it is you pretend
to know something about in your life.


With PPD, you might feel as if you caused a person to exist and
every moment of his or her life is misery. You have made life's biggest
and most irrevocable mistake. You need to get the fuck out of here,

[p. <i>5</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If you are fortunate, you will not become psychotic; you will not
literally begin to believe that your child is in danger from something
supernaturally evil and you need to smother her or drown her to
keep her safe. But you know it's a possibility; you could slip into
madness five minutes from now. Five minutes from now you may
start hearing voices that aren't really there. How will you know the
difference?


All new parents are sleep deprived. But even when your baby is
napping, you lie there staring at the ceiling. Even in repose, your
heart is racing, and it feels like someone is standing on your stomach.
Sometimes you are bored. Sometimes you are anxious. You
know you should rest but you can't.


Postpartum depression isn't the same as the "baby blues," when
your hormones crash after delivery and you sweat like a pig, cry
constantly, and collapse into a puddle. This is common and physiologically
explicable. Postpartum depression is what happens next.
Postpartum depression is what happens when your brain becomes
stuck in a state of misery. Whatever triggered it—isolation, stressful

[p. <i>6</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

According to the National Mental Health Association, the
symptoms of postpartum depression are:


• increased crying and irritability


• hopelessness and sadness


• uncontrollable mood swings


• feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope


• fear of harming the baby, self, or others


• fear of being alone


• lack of interest or excessive concern for the baby


• poor self-care


• loss of interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia)


• withdrawal or isolation from others


• inability to think clearly or make decisions

• fatigue

• sleep disturbances unrelated to the baby's sleep patterns


• headaches, hyperventilation, heart palpitations <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_11292');">[note]</a><div id="_note_11292" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">4.

Some researchers estimate the incidence of postpartum depression at about 10 percent—a figure that refers only to <i>biological mothers</i>,

[p. <i>7</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then there is postpartum stress disorder, which postpartum
mental health expert Karen Kleiman describes as "an acute state
of being overwhelmed and overloaded" (in other words, "early
motherhood"). Talk therapy is indicated for postpartum stress, and
behavioral changes are therapeutic: adjusting your expectations,
setting priorities, receiving help with caring for your family. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13095');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13095" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">6. Karen Kleiman and Valerie Raskin, <i>This Isn't What I Expected: Overcoming
Postpartum Depression</i> (New York: Bantam, 1994).</div>


There is also postpartum anxiety, a term that describes the
onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or generalized
anxiety disorder after delivery. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_13426');">[note]</a><div id="_note_13426" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">7. Postpartum Resource Center of Texas, <a href="www.texaspostpartum.org/PPD.html">www.texaspostpartum.org/PPD.html</a>.</div> Another anxiety disorder,
post-traumatic stress disorder, is also observable in the postpartum
period; for example, a woman's labor and delivery may trigger a
response to a traumatic event in her past, such as sexual abuse.


Then there's postpartum psychosis: severe agitation, hallucinations,
and delusions. This is the jackpot of postpartum mood
disorders, affecting only one in one thousand women. Postpartum
psychosis is a medical <i>emergency</i>, like cardiac arrest. It requires
immediate medical attention.


Yet too many people simply don't believe in PPD, like the husband
of a woman I met at a talk I was giving. "He says I have to make
up for the past two years," she explained, as if she'd been delinquent
instead of mentally ill. Other women in the room suggested that by
that logic, he should "make up" for his body's various maladies over
the years—including any instances of erectile dysfunction.


PPD is not a phantom ailment limited to married, middle-class
women with "high expectations" of motherhood. Young mothers

[p. <i>8</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Middle-class heterosexual white chicks with PPD—much like
your author—get the most press because, I'm ashamed to say, we
have the greatest access to healthcare providers, particularly in the
United States, where such access is related to our employment and
marital status. We have the greatest access to antidepressant medications
and psychoanalytic therapy. And it is we who "should" be
happy; a deviation from the "happy mother" norm is, in our case, the
most glaring. It is less newsworthy when a poor mother, a mother
of color, or a single mother is depressed. When people who "have
it all" nonetheless lose touch with reality or hurt our children, or
ourselves, the outcry is louder. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_15919');">[note]</a><div id="_note_15919" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">9. Consider the 2003 case of Deanna LaJune Laney, a working-class woman
who beat two of her sons to death and critically injured a third, then called
sheriff's deputies to calmly report the crime. Or Naomi Gaines, an African-American
woman who dropped her two sons into the Mississippi River
outside of St. Paul, Minnesota, then jumped into the water to kill herself.
Or Khoua Her, a Laotian immigrant who killed her six children, then
attempted to strangle herself. The names that are household words—such
as Andrea Yates and Susan Smith—belong to white, middle-class women,
college graduates.</div>


PPD has been observed and studied in almost every cultural
environment imaginable: in rural Uganda, in the United Arab
Emirates, among Hmong immigrants, and in northeastern and central
Wisconsin. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_16754');">[note]</a><div id="_note_16754" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">10. Hagen, Edward H., "The Functions of Postpartum Depression," www
.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/ppd.pdf</div>


Middle-class Caucasian women with higher education are also
of a culture that values medical intervention and psychoanalytic:
therapy more highly than do many other cultures. According to
Linda Clark Amankwaa, attitudes about postpartum depression and
its treatment are affected by culture insofar as different groups possess
"a distinctive language related to depression, the transmission

[p. <i>9</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In a 2000 study of African American women with postpartum
depression,


[p]articipants suggested that depression was something
that would not be disclosed readily among African-American
people (or outsiders) because of the stigma
attached to it and the negative consequences. These negative
consequences include past atrocities encountered by
African-American people in health care systems, particularly
mental health institutional systems where African-American
children were taken from their mothers, and
other stigmas regarding African-American women's care
of their children. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_18321');">[note]</a><div id="_note_18321" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">12. Amankwaa, L. C. C., "Enduring: A grounded theory investigation of
postpartum depression among African-American women," (doctoral
dissertation, Georgia State University, 2000), <i>Dissertation Abstracts
International</i>, 60, 03B.</div>


Cultural factors also mitigate a woman's readiness to disclose
her postpartum depression. While mental illness is stigmatized
almost globally, Rhoda Barge Johnson and Joan Crowley write of
a so-called "John Henry" phenomenon, an attitude among some
African Americans that hard work—indeed, working oneself to
death, like the eponymous folk hero did—is the only way to overcome
obstacles. <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_19001');">[note]</a><div id="_note_19001" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">13. Johnson, R. &amp; Crowley, J., "An Analysis of Stress Denial," in <i>Mental Health
in Black America</i> (H. Neighbors &amp; J. Jackson, London: Sage Publications,
1996), 62-76.</div> Reaching out for help or admitting weakness carries
a greater price.


This certainly does not mean that African American parents do
not experience depression. In fact, the converse may well be true:
African American parents experience depression as frequently or
more often than people of other races, and a crisis of public health
policy is afoot.

[p. <i>10</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Employment and migration patterns in North America also
complicate the postpartum experience. New parents in the same
"newlywed and nearly dead" or commuter neighborhood may never
meet; our sisters and mothers may live in different regions. We do
not have access to the wisdom of others, except for the "experts"—
our pediatricians and childcare gurus—whose prescriptive and
impersonal advice undermines our self-confidence.


Researchers theorize that in cultures that practice postpartum
ritual and have centralized populations (such as nonindustrialized
Africa) "postpartum depression" is less common. According to J.
L. Cox, "the lack of obstetric and family rituals lowers a mother's
self-esteem, stresses the marital relationship, and can represent an
ambivalent social status." <a href="javascript: __showhidenote('_note_20522');">[note]</a><div id="_note_20522" style="display:none;background-color:#FFDD99;margin:0px;border:2px solid #800000; padding:2px;">14. Cox J. L., "Childbirth As a Life Event: Sociocultural Aspects of Postnatal
Depression," <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i>, (1988): 344, 75-83.</div> In many non-Western cultures a new
mother is cared for or attended by a female relation or neighbor
for the immediate postpartum period—this is known as "doing the
month." Western women receive less social support; indeed, we are
expected to "bounce back" on our own within the arbitrary period
of six weeks—regaining our prepregnancy figures, resuming "normal"
relations with our sexual partners, returning to paid work (if
we have it), and shepherding infants who sleep well and are contented.
Parenting magazines encourage us to flatten our abdomens,
regulate our children's sleeping and eating schedules, dress tastefully,
and otherwise <i>exhibit no signs</i> of having recently given birth.
Our models are soap opera actresses and pop divas with personal
trainers and baby nurses, not mothers, sisters, neighbors, or members
of our community.


I'm happy to say that with the proliferation of websites and

[p. <i>11</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

There are organized groups for parents of children with autism-spectrum
disorders, asthma, celiac disease, and other special needs.
There are organized groups for stay-at-home fathers, for widows
and widowers, for depressed parents, for mothers of color, for goth
parents, for pagan parents, and for innumerable other groups. If
a group for you doesn't exist, the technology to start your own is
readily available and easily used by nonexperts. This kind of peer-to-peer
support was crucial to my own recovery from PPD; I could
rant about wanting to leave my fussy, vomiting son on the curb for
bulk pickup, and no one judged me.


The Internet also connected me to women in my community;
I wouldn't have found them otherwise. One local group offers a
volunteer service called "Austin Red Tent," in which a member
emails a request for help with a problem and participants mobilize,

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I also learned a hell of a lot: A squirt of breast milk in the eye will
heal conjunctivitis. Household vinegar (5 percent acidity) disinfects
as well as household bleach. Cloth diapers aren't impossible to use. I
learned all kinds of interesting stuff not even related to parenting: I
learned how to care for carnivorous plants. I learned about frat-hop
music and programming languages. I learned how to help a friend
in rehab. I learned about having anal sex safely. (Don't ever, <i>ever
</i>use that anesthetizing lubricant.) I learned all kinds of neat shit that
makes me a better, more informed parent, a happier person, and a
good citizen. And I got lots and lots of encouragement, something
<i>all kinds of parents</i> receive far too infrequently.


Here's another myth about mental illness and PPD in particular:
You can just "get over it." In her fine memoir <i>Sleepless Days</i>, Susan
Kushner Resnick writes that you probably will get better even if you
don't do anything, but it will take time. Of course, time is not on the
side of a mentally ill person. The cycle for postpartum depression
is lengthy. According to the Postpartum Health Alliance, untreated
postpartum depression can take three to four years to resolve. That's
three to four years of your life, of your kid's life—years you can
spend getting crazier, lying awake at night, crying through every
day, wishing to die and maybe even trying to, hurting yourself, hurting
your kid. (Studies indicate that children of depressive mothers
have higher levels of the stress hormone Cortisol in their bodies,

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1003387567-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

If any of this sounds like you or someone you love, get help. It
will be hard, but living with mental illness is harder. Get ahold of
anyone and everyone you can. Tell your neighbor. Tell your doctor
if you have one, or your midwife, or your chiropractor. Tell your
parents. Tell the person who delivers your mail. Hit the panic button,
if that's what it takes. Get your hands on any resource you possibly
can. Stop pretending you don't need help, and take any that's
offered to you.


It is taboo for mothers to confess their anger, their confusion,
their frustration, their resentment. Yet these are feelings we all possess,
on our best days and our worst. "Sometimes babies are little
sods," a mother from Great Britain told me once. She was a professor
at Oxford Brookes University, and from a highly academic
twenty-minute discussion of "the moral context in which women
continue to mother in the West," this simple truism is my only
memory.


So read on. I'll tell you about everything I did. How I went
crazy. How I danced around my living room with my fussy kid to
inappropriate music. How my marriage hit the skids. How I survived
therapy, six doctors, and a naturopath. How I went out to kill
myself but couldn't get a baby sitter. And how I got my shit together
and went on with my life somehow. I'm not telling you what to do,
exactly—perhaps my life is not like yours, or perhaps I benefited
from resources to which you have no access, or perhaps you simply
