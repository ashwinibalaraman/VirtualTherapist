<font size="4"><b>8: Parenting in Reconstituted and Surrogate Families</b></font>

<b>SUMMARY</b>


Parenting issues in families that are not 'intact' in the biological and structural sense
are reviewed and discussed. These include one-parent families, stepfamilies, adoptive
and foster families, and families formed by artificial reproduction techniques. Family
structure in itself does not account for differences in parenting quality. Rather, adults'
and children's histories of relationships are important in determining the nature of
parent-child relationships. The main implication of these conclusions is that the
fostering of stability in children's lives is pivotal to their well-being, regardless of
family structure.


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>


Parenting is a challenge in all families, even
those who have the obvious advantages of two
competent and harmonious parents with children
who are wanted and loved. However, when there
are variations in family structure and relationships,
such as reconstituted households or those
where children are not the biological offspring of
the parents, then there are extra challenges to be
faced. In stepfamilies, for instance, one parent is
not biologically related to the children of the
other, and is usually fulfilling a parenting role
whilst the other biological parent may still be
involved in the children's lives. In families
where children are adopted, neither parent is
usually related to the children, and there may, if
the adoption is open, be the added complication
of ongoing relationships between children and at
least one of their biological parents. Families
created by new technologies present perhaps the
most interesting situations, since the complications
of parent-child relationships are even more
impressive. A child in such a family may, for
example, have two social parents, two genetic
parents, and one surrogate mother.


In this chapter, parenting issues faced by families
who are not 'intact' in the biological and structural
sense will be considered. Intact families are
often referred to as 'nuclear', and for the purposes
of comparison this term will be interpreted to mean
families in which two married heterosexual
parents live with their biological children conceived
and born by natural means. Where there is
evidence available that assesses parenting and
parent-child relationships in non-nuclear families,
the findings will be discussed. The implications
arising from these for families themselves, for
practice and for policy will also be considered.

<b>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</b>


The history of families tells us that children have
not always been brought up by their biological
parents. Prior to the 18th century, it was the norm
in Europe for children to be sent to live in other
households as apprentices or servants, and
indeed a family was defined as those living in a
household, including servants and others. There
were, too, many orphans as a result of high levels
of maternal mortality, so that many children
did not grow up in two-parent families with their
biological parents. Though children and looking
after them has always been important, the reality
of frequent child mortality is likely to have mitigated
parental preoccupation with their children.
Surrogate parenting was, then, commonplace and
it was not until what we know as the nuclear
family emerged, and mortality and fertility
declined, that what we now refer to as intact
families became the norm. Throughout most of
the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries,
nuclear families prevailed in Western countries.
Increasingly, children became the foci of their
parents' lives as their survival became more
likely and families restricted the numbers of
children they bore. Families became truly
nuclear in the sense that they relied on a small
and isolated group of biologically related people
within the household unit for emotional, psychological
and physical support. This trend endured
into much of the next century.


<b>FAMILIES AFTER DIVORCE</b>


Stable and relatively inflexible gender roles
meant that parenting in this nuclear group was
predominantly the domain of mothers. None the
less, it was not until the beginning of the 20th
century that it was considered appropriate for
mothers to have custody of children after
divorce. Until then they were the property of
their fathers and, in the comparatively rare cases
that divorces occurred, children remained in their
fathers' households. Early in the 20th century,
the 'doctrine of tender years' emerged, which
held that children were properly to be raised by
their mothers even in the event of divorce. This
view was buttressed by the writings of John
Bowlby who asserted that mothers were of
primary importance to children, with fathers best
seen in the role of supporters of the mothers'
parenting. Freud saw the mother-child relationship
as 'unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and
strongest love-object and as the prototype of all
later love relations - for both sexes' (Freud,
1940). The 'mother mystique' emerging from all
this meant that children usually lived with their
mothers after divorce. This has gathered pace so
that mothers are usually the primary parents after
separation, though the pattern may be changing,
particularly for teenage children.


This means that women most often head lone-parent
households. In the UK, over 18 per cent of
children lived in lone-parent households in the
1990s (Haskey, 1994); of these, less than 10 per
cent lived with fathers. In the US, 27 per cent of
children lived with a lone parent (Saluter, 1996)
and 14 per cent of these lived with their fathers
(Rawlings and Saluter, 1996). In practice, therefore,
large numbers of children are being parented
primarily by mothers. There has been a
particular focus on the economic stresses faced
particularly by lone mothers, and on the more
general stress of parenting alone. Women who
may not have been in the workforce before
divorce are often forced to get a job, either partor
full-time, in order to support themselves and
their children. Lone parents, then, find themselves
single-handedly balancing work and parenting
with varying degrees of support from
ex-partners and extended family members.


Parenting by fathers after divorce has been a
comparatively neglected topic. Many men lose
contact with their children (Seltzer, 1991) and for
some others, parenting is at best a part-time
endeavour confined, by and large, to the entertainment
of their children. Increasingly, however,
men are becoming more involved with
children after separation (Gibson, 1992; Simpson
et al., 1995; Maclean and Eekelaar, 1997). This
has led to the recent examination of parenting by
fathers after divorce. Other influences have also
encouraged an examination of fathering, including
the understanding from developmental psychology
research about the importance of men in
their children's lives (Lamb, 1995); the impact of
the men's movement; and the voices of children
themselves that articulate their desire to have
their fathers involved in their lives.


<b>STEPFAMILIES</b>


Stepfamilies have always existed, although in the
past they were most likely to be formed as the
result of the death of a parent. Today they are, in
the main, a result of divorce. The majority of
adults re-partner after separation, with two-thirds
of women and three-quarters of men in the US
marrying after divorce (Bumpass et al., 1990).

[p. <i>112</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00130&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Another way in which stepfamilies are formed
is through the partnership of women who have
conceived a child while un-partnered. In Europe,
70 per cent of women in this situation go into
partnerships (Kiernan, 1999). In the US, too,
children born to lone mothers are very likely to
enter a step family before the age of 16 (Aquilino,
1996). In these families, children have not usually
experienced parental separation and may not
have known their biological fathers before entering
a stepfamily.


The majority of stepfamilies are those in
which children are living with their biological
mothers, who continue their parenting roles
through the transitions of divorce and repartnering.
In stepmother families, where
children are the biological offspring of their
fathers, stepmothers usually take on primary
parenting roles with children who are not theirs,
especially if children are young (Ferri and Smith,
1998). In stepfamilies, then, we need to consider
the parenting of both the biological parent and of
the step-parent, and to distinguish the situations
in stepfather and stepmother households.


In stepfather families, children continue in the
main to be parented by biological parents, that is,
their mothers. In stepmother families where their
resident biological parent is their father, they are
more likely to be parented primarily by a
non-biological parent, that is, their stepmother.
So children in stepmother families have to adapt
to being parented by someone who is not related
to them and who may be a comparative stranger.
For children in stepfather families, this adaptation
does not have to be made although they and
their mothers have to get used to a relationship
that is no longer the exclusive one they may have
had when they lived as a one-parent family.


Biological parents may have to contend with
tensions between the demands of their new partners
and those of their own children. For
children, there is the adjustment to be made to
having another adult in the house who not only
absorbs their parents' attention but may also
adopt and exercise a parenting role toward them.
In turn, step-parents face the challenges of integrating
themselves into family groups that have
existed without them and of both establishing
and maintaining partner relationships, and forging
relationships with sometimes recalcitrant and
resentful stepchildren.


Therapists who work with stepfamilies have
suggested that the adults sometimes attempt to
model themselves on intact families, and to adopt
parenting roles that worked in their original
households (Visher and Visher, 1990). This may
be a result of the desire to seem 'normal' and to
establish relationships as close and loving as
those assumed to exist in biologically related
families. Sadly this approach does not work
smoothly, since older children do not adapt
easily to a strange adult moving into a disciplinary
role with them, especially if their own father
or mother is still involved in their lives. Children
may resist step-parents' approaches to parenting
and discipline; they may also move regularly
between houses so that daily routines are impossible
to put in place. In some ways, then, step-parents
find themselves without 'scripts' about
how to parent since the original family model
does not work. Much as they may want to,
instantly loving relationships are not possible
to create, and perhaps the best they can do is to
develop workable relationships at least in the
first instance.


Unfortunately, the difficulties faced by step-family
living mean that they falter and dissolve
more often than first-marriage families. In the
US, 54 per cent of remarried women, and 64 per
cent of remarried men, divorce a second time
(Martin and Bumpass, 1989). In a New Zealand
cohort of families with children, 53 per cent of
stepfamily households dissolved within five years
of formation (Fergusson et al., 1984). In turn, parents,
displaying what might be described as the
triumph of hope over experience, often enter further
partnerships so that children experience multiple
family transitions. In the same New Zealand
cohort, for example, nearly one in five children
had lived in three family situations by the age of
nine.


<b>ADOPTIVE FAMILIES</b>


The history of parenting in adoptive families is
not well known. In the past, adoptions tended to
be secret and children were not told that they
were not their parents' biological offspring. This
situation may have arisen from a general ambivalence
about non-biological parent-child relationships,
and the persistent negative association for
men and women between infertility and selfesteem.
Birth mothers, too, were not likely to
reveal the existence of illegitimate children in a

[p. <i>113</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00131&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Because of this, there is a widely held assumption
that children in adoptive families are at risk,
although the few studies that have systematically
compared their outcomes present a mixed picture.
In some ways adopted children do better,
and in other ways worse, than their non-adopted
siblings (Sharma et al., 1998), age at adoption
being a crucial factor in this regard. The younger
the age at adoption, the better the outcome will
be in general. Overall, there are few differences
in outcomes and it is probable that any disadvantages
they may face arise as much from the climate
of ambivalence they face from peers and
others who know about their status, as from
internal family dynamics (Ambert, 2001).
Another source of possible disadvantage for
adopted children lies in the conditions of their
antenatal life and birth; mothers who relinquish
their children may not take care of themselves
during pregnancy to the same extent as those
who keep their children. They may smoke and
drink more, and be more likely to have birth
complications (Golombok et al., 1990).


Unlike parents who have conceived and borne
their children, adoptive parents do not have the
antenatal period in which to develop a relationship
with the unborn child. Neither, in the normal
course of events, do they have contact with their
child in the perinatal and neonatal period. The
transition to parenthood is, then, different for
parents who adopt if they have been unable to
have their own biological children. They face
challenges beyond those for biological parents
since, in common with others who have experienced
infertility such as those who conceive with
the help of reproductive technology, they have
sometimes endured intrusive medical procedures
in their bid to overcome infertility. They have
had to come to terms with the failure of these
efforts, in the context of their own and others'
views about the desirability of biological parent-child
relationships.


It is estimated that one million children in the
US live in adoptive families. These households
are heterogeneous, because they vary widely in
their formation and composition. For example,
adoptions may be transracial or international;
they may be by gay or lesbian couples, or single
adults, or step-parents. There are also variations
in children who are adopted in terms of age, disability,
and previous histories of fostering. It is
likely, therefore, that family relationships and
parenting will vary considerably across adoptive
households.


<b>FOSTER FAMILIES</b>


Fostering of children who cannot, for various
reasons, be parented by their biological parents,
has been a part of human society throughout
history and across cultures. It has both similarities
and differences compared with adoption. As
in adoptive families, the parent-child relationship
is not a biological one although an extended
family member may foster children. Both fostering
and adoption can happen at various stages in
a child's life, and the earlier they occur, the less
likely that a child will have had adverse parenting
experiences. Because both fostered and
adopted children are relinquished by their often
disadvantaged parents, they may also share the
risk of a less than optimal prenatal environment.
The consequences of inadequate antenatal care,
smoking, and substance abuse include, for example,
pre-term birth and growth retardation.


Major differences lie in the different perceptions
and contexts inherent in fostering and adoption.
Regardless of the age of children, adoptive
parents intend from the start to include them as
permanent members of their families. Their
intention is to form a family, or to add a child to
their existing family. Their commitment to their
children will, then, be greater than that of foster
parents. Foster parents, in contrast, may be less
likely to make a total emotional investment in
children whom they anticipate losing, although
many foster relationships become permanent
arrangements. So although the majority are
loving and adequate parents, their temporary
status as 'professional care-givers' means that
they are much less likely to be totally and unconditionally
accepting of their foster child. Added
to this, foster parents are paid for their parenting,
so that at least a part of their motivation for
caring for children may be economic.


Another difference lies in the fact that foster
parents often care for more than one non-related
child. Their household typically encompasses
their own biological children, and one or more
foster children who may or may not themselves
be siblings. Children who are fostered, then, have
to adjust not just to new parents but also to a variety
of siblings.


Finally, foster children who are not placed at
or near birth are likely to have been relinquished
by parents who have not parented them satisfactorily.
They may have been exposed to insensitive

[p. <i>114</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00132&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Impermanence, professional status of parents,
and children's previous histories are, therefore,
important factors that may impinge on parenting
in foster families.


<b>FAMILIES FORMED BY
ARTIFICIAL REPRODUCTIVE
TECHNOLOGIES (ART)</b>


Families produced as a result of new reproductive
technologies are comparatively recent, and
present particularly complex relationship constellations
for their members. Beside the relatively
simple scenario where sperm is supplied
by a donor because a husband is infertile, many
more complicated arrangements arise that raise
questions about parenting and about children's
understanding of family relationships. A particularly
challenging situation, for example, is posed
for the French child whose mother bore him at
the age of 62 and who is his biological (because
she bore him) and social (because she is raising
him) mother. His genetic (and possibly social
father) is his uncle, and his genetic mother is a
woman who donated an ovum. Other complicated
relationships include the situation where a
mother may carry a child by surrogacy for her
infertile daughter, thus being her granddaughter's
'carrying mother'.


By definition, families formed through the use
of artificial reproductive technologies are formed
through processes that arise as a result of infertility
in one or both parents. There are several
consequences of this. Parents will have experienced
interventions, both medical and social, that
do not conform to the usually straightforward
process of sexual intercourse leading to pregnancy
and childbirth. They are likely to have had
long periods of uncertainty about whether or not
they will have children, and of waiting. There are
also varying degrees of genetic relatedness
between them and their children, ranging from
none to one or the other parent contributing
genetic material to their offspring.


ART parents are also likely to be older than
those with naturally conceived children by the
time they take on parenthood, and may be materially
better off, especially in countries where the
cost of fertility treatment is high. These parents,
then, come to parenting with a constellation of
factors some of which they share with adoptive
parents, and others that are unique to them. Van
Balen (1998) has described four commonly held
assumptions about families formed in this way.
One is that the child is seen as a precious gift to be
protected, leading to over-protective behaviours
by parents. Another is that children are so wanted
that they are 'over desired', leading to high and
unrealistic expectations of and about them. A third
is that because ART parents have had years of living
without children, they will find it more difficult
than most to adapt to the demands of
parenting, since they have become used to a
lifestyle without responsibilities. And finally,
because of the nature of their conception and birth,
their children may be perceived as different, and
parental attitudes and behaviour toward their
children will be affected by these perceptions.


It is not surprising, then, that parenting and
outcomes for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) children
have confidently been predicted to be problematic.
In regard to scientific developments in
human reproductive technology, Snowden
(1998) has suggested that 'it is difficult not to
exaggerate their potential effect on the biological,
personal, and social experience of human life
as we know it today.'


Overall, the experiences of separation, divorce,
stepfamily formation, and adoptive, fostering and
IVF family living bring with them several crucial
factors that may have an impact on parenting, and
that are not characteristic of nuclear families.
Table 8.1 shows the presence or absence of these
factors in the families discussed here.


Transitions made by parents are almost always
accompanied by distress and stress, which has an
impact on their ability to parent effectively. The
emotional energy required to cope with the loss of
a partnership and the structural changes such as
moving houses and neighbourhoods mean that
they often have depleted resources for looking
after their children. Similarly, family transitions
for children are well documented as being stressful
and likely to affect their behaviour in the short
term, as well as their well-being in the medium
and long term (Pryor and Rodgers, 2001).


The question of biological relationship is
addressed as potentially a major factor in relation
to parenting in stepfamilies (e.g. Hetherington
et al., 1999). It is assumed that any deficiencies
in step-parent-,stepchild relationships are a product
of a lack of 'ownness' or genetic relationship
between adult and child. Thus it is also a potential
issue for ART and adoptive parents.


The experience of infertility, too, is one that
brings its own stresses and disappointments that

[p. <i>115</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00133&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I005&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

Social stigma is apparent in the accounts of
individuals in families who are not nuclear, and
has led, for example, to the former National
Stepfamily Association in the UK being renamed.
It is also apparent in the accounts of
some children whose parents have divorced,
when they say they do not want their friends or
teachers to know (Douglas and Murch, 2002). In
practice it is almost impossible to measure the
impact of stigma on parent-child relationships
since they are so dependent on the psychological
state and well-being of those involved in them.


Sustaining relationships with multiple parenting
figures is not an uncommon experience for
large numbers of children. This is especially the
case in those stepfamilies who have relationships
with non-resident parents and often two step-parents.
In situations of open adoption, and possibly
even in ART families where donor parents
are known to children, children are also likely to
sustain relationships with several parents, and to
make their own sense of those relationships.
Again, the implications of this factor for parenting
are complex and not well examined.
Children are remarkably pragmatic about families,
and accept a wide range of structures as
'family' (Pryor and Rodgers, 2001; Anyan and
Pryor, 2002). Their ability to accept and benefit
from a variety of parenting figures is, therefore,
likely to depend primarily on how the complex
of relationships is handled by adults in their
lives.


Finally, ethnic and cultural differences may
have an impact on adoptive and foster families in
particular, but also potentially in stepfamilies and
ART families. Physical differences between
parents and children are an obvious potential
source of unfamiliarity. So too are attitudes to
and expectations of families, especially those
held by children who are beyond infancy when
adopted or fostered. And, when children reach
adolescence, issues of cultural and ethnic identity
come to the fore and require addressing by young
people and their parents.


The conduit through which these factors have
their impact on children is primarily in their
effect on parenting and parent-child relationships.
Parenting, then, is central to our concern
for children in these families, since it orchestrates
and funnels these and other diverse factors.


<b>PARENTING IN NON-TRADITIONAL
FAMILIES: WHAT DO WE KNOW?</b>


In examinations of parenting in non-nuclear or
non-traditional families, comparisons are most
frequently made with intact families, that is,
households with two heterosexual married
parents and their biological children. In some
cases these may not be the most appropriate
comparisons to be made. For example, in considering
parent-child relationships in stepfamilies,
a more appropriate comparison might be with
lone-parent families where children have also
experienced parental separation. Similarly, in
families formed as a result of artificial reproductive
technologies the common experience of

[p. <i>116</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00134&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Parenting in Lone-Parent Households</i></b>


Numerous studies in the US and the UK have
documented that as a group lone parents are
more likely to show poor parenting techniques
than those in intact families (Hetherington and
Clingempeel, 1992; Emery, 1994; McLanahan
and Sandfur, 1994; Simons, 1996; Dunn et al.,
1998; Hetherington, 1999). They are, for example,
more likely than mothers in intact families
inappropriately to leave their children alone at
times, and less likely to provide supervision, help
with school work, and set rules for TV watching
(McLanahan and Sandfur, 1994). Separated
mothers are more likely to display negative attitudes
to their children, and less likely to behave
positively toward them, than mothers in intact
and stepfamilies (Deater-Deckard and Dunn,
1999). In general, authoritative parenting,
encompassing high levels of support and appropriate
monitoring, is less often seen in lone-parent
than other households (Avenevoli et al.,
1999).


Most of the studies that report these findings
are based on cross-sectional comparisons of
intact and lone-parent families. However, it is
not clear from cross-sectional comparisons
whether inadequate parenting arises as a result
of the stresses of separation and parenting alone,
or whether separated mothers still displayed
poor parenting when they were in partnerships.
Some longitudinal studies have found that
women who subsequently separated showed
high levels of negative behaviour and low levels
of control of their children <i>before</i> the separation
(Hetherington et al, 1999). This may reflect the
fact that partnerships deteriorate some time before
parents part and conflict is often present as a
lead-up to separation, so that reduced parenting
skills may reflect the stress of parents in the
lead-up to the separation. Family transitions are,
though, usually accompanied by a deterioration in
parenting quality (DeGarmo and Forgatch, 1999),
whether they be from intact to lone-parent
households, or from lone-parent to stepfamily
formation. This suggests the significant impact
of stresses associated specifically with the transitions
from one family form to another, such as
moving house and neighbourhoods, and economic
change. Some time after a transition, the
quality of parenting usually returns to levels
similar to those before separation, although conflict
between mothers and children in lone-parent
households may persist (Hetherington and
Clingempeel, 1992).


<i><b>Parenting by Non-residential Parents</b></i>


In the majority of situations, non-residential
parents are fathers. For many children, fathers are
completely absent from their lives after divorce,
so they do not experience parenting of any kind
from them (Seltzer, 1991). Increasingly, however,
fathers are remaining in contact with their children
and there are two main factors that are likely to
influence this increase in contact. One is the payment
of child support, which has become institutionalized
in most countries. There is a positive
association between payment of child support and
contact with children (Seltzer, 1991; Arditti,
1992) although the direction of this relationship is
not clear. For some men, the fact that they contribute
economically to their children's upbringing
may lead them to demand more contact. On the
other hand, fathers who want to be involved with
their children may be more likely to pay child support.
The second factor is the increasing incidence
of joint custody for children. By definition, this
means that fathers with shared custody are more
likely than those without legal or residential cus
tody to have regular contact with their children.


Contact does not automatically mean that
fathers are involved in parenting their children.
For many, contact means entertainment in the
form of movies, playgrounds, and take-away food.
In practice it is difficult for non-residential parents
to be heavily involved unless their children stay
with them regularly so that active parenting skills
are called upon and developed in a manner appropriate
to children's age and gender. To the extent
that parents <i>are</i> involved with their children's
lives and can provide both support and monitoring,
their children benefit (Amato and Gilbreth,
1999). Non-residential mothers are more likely
than non-residential fathers to be involved in the
lives of their children (Gunnoe, 1993), something
that can be an important challenge for stepmothers,
as discussed below.


<i><b>Men as Lone Parents</b></i>


Boys, and older children are most likely to live
with their fathers (Australian Bureau of
Statistics, 1991; Maccoby and Mnookin, 1992;
Cancian and Meyer, 1998). Perhaps because
fathers are a minority of lone residential parents,
there is little research that examines their parenting.

<b><i>Parenting in Stepfamilies</i></b>


When a stepfamily is formed, several changes in
family dynamics occur that call for considerable
adaptation by adults and children. From one
perspective, it might be anticipated that in repartnering,
a lone mother is improving the situation
for her children. Household income rises
(McLanahan and Sandfur, 1994), alleviating economic
stress that is often associated with poor
parenting (Simons, 1996). Re-partnering also
means that a second adult who is another potential
parenting figure is present, or at least provides
a source of support for the first parent.
However, there are also some challenges to be
faced that might mitigate these advantages, principally
the adaptation of existing relationships to
the changed situations, and the establishment of
new ones.


<b><i>Parenting by Mothers in Stepfather Families</i></b>


Parenting and parent-child relationships are
often poor in the period after a stepfamily household
is formed, probably because of the adaptations
required. In the early stages of stepfamily
formation, mothers in stepfamilies report being
more negative and less positive in interactions
with their children (Bray and Berger, 1993; Dunn
et al., 1998). They are more likely to show disengaged
parenting, typified by low levels of support
and control, than those in first-marriage
families (Hetherington and Clingempeel, 1992).


Interactions, of course, are two-way, and
children have been found to display negative
behaviour toward their mothers soon after stepfamily
formation (Vuchinich et al., 1991;
Hetherington and Clingempeel, 1992; Bray and
Berger, 1993). The quality of parent-child
relationships is determined, therefore, not just by
the behaviour and attitudes of mothers, but also
by the behaviour of their children who, in the
case of stepfamilies in the early stages, may be
negative and difficult.


Several factors are important here, however.
One is the time since the stepfamily formed. In
families that have been established for several
years, parenting is of much the same quality
as that shown in first-marriage families
(Hetherington et al., 1999). The changes and disruptions
associated with early life in a stepfamily
appear to contribute to a lowering of parenting
standards because of the changes called for from
all family members and the depletion of energy
for parenting in adults, as they establish their
own new relationship. The quality of parenting
tends to return in time either to levels shown
before re-partnering or to those in first-marriage
families.


A second factor is the age of children at the
time of re-partnering. Relationships between
mothers and young children appear to be comparatively
resilient, settling down to function
well over time. This may be because of the relative
dependence of younger children in comparison
with adolescents, and their readiness to
accept the presence of another adult in the family.
However, those families in which children
are older, and particularly if they are early adolescents,
are more fraught. For these young
people, issues of developing autonomy from
parental authority, peer relationships, and burgeoning
sexuality make it more difficult to
adjust to the changes in their family structure and
dynamics. Parent-child relationships and parenting
may never be restored to the same levels of
good functioning as those of adolescents and
parents in first-marriage families, and in one
study, by the age of 15 years, one-third of boys
and one-quarter of girls had disengaged from their
stepfamily households (Hetherington, 1993).


A third factor is the gender of the child. Girls
whose mothers re-partner have more fraught
relationships with their mothers than do boys. It
has been suggested that this is because a girl and
her lone mother form a particularly close relationship,
which is disrupted by the intrusion into
their lives of another person who absorbs much
of the mother's attention and detracts from the
mother-daughter relationship. Boys, on the other
hand, may benefit from the presence of a male
adult in the household and there is some inferential
support for this view, as they are likely to
have experienced difficult relationships with their
mothers in lone-parent households (Hetherington,
1993). It may be that the new family constellation
eases the mother-son relationship.

[p. <i>118</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00136&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

A fourth factor relates to the particular aspect
of parenting being considered. A recent study
using panel data from the National Survey of
Families and Households in the US found that
when lone mothers re-partnered they showed less
harsh discipline techniques, and their children
reported closer mother-child relationships than
when their mother had been single (Thomson
et al., 2001). Supervision of the child, however,
did not improve with re-partnering or remarriage,
perhaps because the associated residential changes
disrupts or reduces monitoring by parents.


<b><i>Parenting by Stepfathers</i></b>


Men who move into parenting roles in relation to
their partners' children face the task of building
relationships with young people to whom they
are not biologically related. The children usually
have a non-resident father who is more or less
involved in their lives, but the day-to-day parenting
falls to their mother and their stepfather.
There are several potential disadvantages. First,
stepfather and stepchildren have not shared the
infancy and early childhood of the children, the
time when shared histories are established and
children and adults adapt to each other. Second,
children may resent the intrusion of another adult
into their lives in a parenting role. Third, they
may see their stepfather as competition for their
mother's attentions. And fourth, children often
have a biological father whom they regard as
their 'proper' father. How, then, do stepfathers
parent their stepchildren?


Like mothers in stepfamilies, they are less likely
than fathers in intact families to monitor children's
behaviour (Hetherington and Clingempeel, 1992;
Voydanoff et al., 1994; Hetherington et al.,
1999). Some studies suggest that, compared with
fathers in intact families, stepfathers show high
levels of warmth (Vuchinich et al., 1991).
Stepfathers, therefore, are likely to engage in
'permissive' parenting, that is, high levels of
warmth and low levels of control. Although it is
generally accepted that authoritative (high
warmth, high control) parenting is optimal for
children in all family structures, those studies
that have examined parenting in stepfamilies
have usually not included permissive parenting,
as a typology. In one that did, family happiness
and the quality of the stepchild-step-parent relationships
were highest in families where stepfathers
were high in warmth and low in control or
monitoring (Crosbie-Bumett and Giles-Sims,
1994). This finding makes sense in light of the
fact that the majority of children, especially adolescents,
in stepfamilies regard their stepfather as
a friend rather than as a parent (Buchanan et al.,
1996; Gorrell Barnes et al., 1998). Permissive
parenting, then, may be optimal for stepfathers,
although it is likely that it will be most successful
where mothers are authoritative parents so
that monitoring is available for children from at
least one parent.


<b><i>Parenting in Stepmother Families</i></b>


Remarkably little research has taken place that
examines the parenting by fathers in stepmother
families, probably because as a group they are a
small minority of stepfamilies, and because
fathers' new partners usually assume primary
parenting. We can assume, though, that men who
have been lone parents before re-partnering
will remain in active parenting roles vis-Ã -vis
their children, particularly in comparison with
stepfathers.


It was noted earlier that non-residential mothers
often remain involved in their children's
lives. They stay in telephone and written contact,
and take a direct monitoring role more than
non-residential fathers do (Thompson, 1994;
Hetherington and Henderson, 1997; Stewart,
1999). This makes the task of being a stepmother
somewhat difficult if she takes a major parenting
role in the family (Ferri and Smith, 1998). There
is little doubt, too, that the continuing spectre of
the wicked stepmother exacerbates the challenges
faced by women put into this difficult
position. Furthermore, stepmothers are often
childless when they come into the family so that
they take on the parenting of someone else's
children with little or no experience.


It is not surprising, then, that the little we
know about stepmother families suggests that
parenting by stepmothers is difficult. They have
reported being less involved with stepchildren
both positively and negatively (Thompson et al.,
1992) and children in stepmother families do not
ease their task. They are less likely to be satisfied
with the degree of closeness with stepmothers
than with stepfathers (Funder, 1996) and more
likely to dislike their stepmother than children
are to dislike their stepfather (Gorell Barnes et al.,
1998). So stepmothers are often in difficult situations
where they are expected to be a primary
parent yet face resistance from stepchildren.
Stepfathers, in contrast, can be more peripheral
in the lives of stepchildren since their partner is
usually in the primary parenting role. It is perhaps
not surprising, then, that Coleman and
Ganong (1997) reported that 'many stepmothers
were dissatisfied enough with their role as residential
or nonresidential stepmother that they

[p. <i>119</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00137&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b><i>Parenting after Multiple Transitions</i></b>


As we have seen, parenting is usually compromised
as parents traverse transitions across
several family structures (DeGarmo and
Forgatch, 1999), since the distress and disruption
accompanying a separation and re-formation of a
household detracts from parents' abilities to
maintain optimal standards of support and
monitoring (Capaldi and Patterson, 1991).
Adolescents whose parents have had several
partnership transitions report that their parents
provide less supervision, show lower levels of
acceptance, and engage in more conflict than
those whose parents who had few or no separations
(Kurdek et al., 1995). In families where
there have been few transitions, positive relationships
between parents and children are more
likely and negative relationships less likely
(Dunn et al., 2000). Not surprisingly, multiple
transitions raise the risks for children of adverse
outcomes in the medium and long term, including
high levels of offending (Fergusson et al.,
1992), poorer educational outcomes (Kurdek
et al., 1995) and producing a child during
adolescence (Wu and Martinson, 1993).


<b><i>Parenting in Adoptive Families</i></b>


The process of securing a child for adoption can
be a frustrating experience that puts stresses on
relationships. However, in some ways adoptive
parents may have an advantage in that they are
likely to be of comparatively higher socio-conomic
status, and to have had considerable
time to prepare for being parents since their decision
to do so is, by definition, a deliberate one.
Furthermore the shared tribulations of facing
infertility and remaining a couple (because some
do not), and preparing for adoption may
strengthen, rather than weaken, their relationship.
Indeed, in an Israeli study of the transition
to parenthood by adoptive couples, it was found
that in comparison with parents of naturally conceived
babies, adoptive parents adapted and
coped better a few months into parenthood
(Levy-Shiff et al., 1991).


There is a remarkably persistent mythology
about 'bonding' that suggests not having contact
with their children antenatally and perinatally
confers a disadvantage on adoptive parents.
However, the notion of bonding derives from
animal models and is not supported by research
with human parent-infant pairs. Far more crucial
is the establishment of secure attachment relationships,
and these do not start to develop until
the infant is several months old. For infant adoptions,
then, the lack of opportunity to 'bond' in
the antenatal and neonatal period should not in
itself be a disadvantage for subsequent parent-child
relationships and parenting in general. In a
study that compared attachment classifications at
11-18 months of age, no differences were found
in groups of non-adopted and adopted infants of
the same race (Singer et al., 1985).


A potentially significant aspect of adoptive
families is that parents and children are not genetically
related, and parents in particular know from
the start that their children are not biological products
of themselves. One predictor of parent-child
relationships in adoptive families is the degree to
which parents feel compatible with their children
(Grotevant and Kohler, 1999). Compatibility
involves feeling harmony with each other, and this
implies communication at a variety of levels. As
children get older, the perspectives on compatibility
of both parents and children may become more
important. Adolescents become more aware of
themselves in relation to others and understand
more fully the potential significance for their sense
of themselves of the lack of biological relationship
with their parents. So the importance of feeling
compatible will increase as issues of personal identity
become more salient in adolescence.


Another aspect of parenting particularly, but
not exclusively, in adoptive families is the extent
to which parents feel a sense of entitlement to
parent their children (Cohen et al, 1996). Although
they have legal rights as parents, this does not
mean that they will necessarily feel psychologically
or emotionally entitled, and this may affect
their ability to monitor and discipline their
children. Cohen et al. (1996, p. 442) suggest that
entitlement 'refers to the parents' presumption
that they are indeed the child's parents with attendant
rights to command authority and set expectations'
and they have operationalized the concept
into four factors: parenting doubts, distance, discipline
success, and discipline comfort.


The most notable findings of Cohen and colleagues
were the few differences that existed
between adoptive and non-adoptive families on
these factors. They found that distance was the
factor most likely to predict difficulties and subsequent
referral of their children for clinical help.
Distance encompassed feelings in parents of
rejection by the child, and feelings that the child
did not feel, or may not in the future feel, like
part of the family. It resembles, then, the notion
of compatibility or similarity in that it involves
mutual ease and good communication.

[p. <i>120</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00138&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Although there has been no empirical
investigation of the links amongst feelings of
entitlement, parenting styles, and outcomes for
children, parenting that involves high levels of
emotional support but low levels of monitoring
('permissive' parenting) is linked with poor
impulse control in children, low levels of persistence
and, in adolescence, excessive reliance on
peers and less involvement in academic pursuits
(Baumrind, 1991; Lamborn et al, 1991; Kurdek
and Fine, 1994). Not feeling entitled to monitor
and discipline children at the same time as loving
them suggests a form of permissive parenting.
We might thus expect that if adopted children are
more likely to be parented this way, then they
will show higher levels of problem behaviour
both concurrently and later. But overall this is
not the case, reflecting the finding that 'lack of
entitlement' is not confined to adoptive parents.


It is widely accepted now that secrecy about
the fact that a child is adopted is ill-advised, and
parents must face and handle sensitively the task
of telling their children that they are adopted.
Most do this around the age of three or four
years, and often use stories as vehicles for
explaining the concepts. Children are usually
pragmatic and accept their adopted status; however,
when they reach adolescence issues of
identity arise that lead them to ponder their biological
origins. Parents of adopted adolescents
often find themselves dealing with issues and
potential conflicts beyond those that normally
accompany adolescence.


It is at this age that children may seek specific
knowledge of their biological parents in order to
determine their contribution to their identity in
both biological and psychological domains. For
some, curiosity about physical and personality
resemblance leads them to want to find and meet
their birth parents as a way of giving better definition
to their burgeoning self-concept. For some
adoptive parents, their children's mission is seen
as a threat to the rapidly changing relationship
that they have with their young people; they fear
that their children may want to abandon them in
favour of biological parents. Most parents realize,
however, that the likelihood of adolescent
children changing loyalties is low and that finding
out about their genetic origins is an important
process of self-discovery and self-understanding.


<i><b>Age at Adoption</b></i>


Unlike former times, children who are beyond
infancy are being increasingly adopted as
neonates become less available to adoptive
parents. They include those who have special
needs, and those whose biological parents have
become or been deemed unable to care for them.
For these children, there has been a life before
adoption in another family or institution, so that
the transition to being adopted is qualitatively
different from those adopted in infancy before
the child's memory and early learning patterns
and relationships are established. Issues of
attachment and sometimes abuse or neglect
become salient for older children. Although there
is evidence that, at least for those who were 11
years old or younger at the time of adoption, successful
adaptation is possible (Hodges and Tizrd,
1989), parenting of children adopted beyond
infancy entails extra challenges for parents. Their
earlier experiences of forming relationships are
likely to be mixed and by definition unsatisfactory,
leading to probable social and behavioural
difficulties throughout childhood and in adolescence
(Howe, 1996). The older they are at the time
of first living with their adoptive parents, the
greater the difficulties are likely to be.


<b><i>Open Adoption</i></b>


In the last three to four decades, adoptions have
become increasingly open, that is, information
about and contact between adopted children and
their birth parents have been allowed and encouraged.
This trend has been viewed with alarm by
some adoptive parents who have been concerned
that such knowledge and communication might
lead to compromised relationships between
themselves and their adopted children. However,
pressure for more open adoptions has come from
the experiences of adopted children who, in adolescence,
seek knowledge of their genetic as well
as their social heritage in constructing a life story
and full identity for themselves.


What is the impact of such openness on adoption?
In one study that addressed this, Grotevant
et al. (1994) compared adoptive families with
four levels of openness on measures reflecting the
concerns of advocates for and against open adoption.
They included aspects of adoptive parents'
feelings about the adoption and their child, and
their attitudes to the birth parents. The results are
strikingly supportive of openness. Parents in fully
disclosed adoptive groups were significantly
more likely to communicate fully with their child
about the adoption; to show empathy for the concerns
of their adopted child; to be more empathetic
toward birth parents; and to acknowledge
the child's interest in his or her background. They
were also less likely to fear the reclaiming of the
child by the birthmother, and (for fathers) to feel
a greater sense of permanence about their child.

[p. <i>121</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00139&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Grotevant et al. point out that there are two
main domains that are important in these findings.
The first is the notion of 'shared fates' between
the adoptive family and the birth family, linked
by the child. Not only birth parents, but also
grandparents and siblings, are likely to make up
the constellation of the birth family contacts,
especially as the adopted child reaches adolescence
and seeks out the less immediate family
members. Second, the concepts of entitlement,
permanence and coherence about their roles suggest
that adoptive parents can and do take on that
identity, rather than pretending to be biological
parents. A caution about the optimistic findings
in this study, however, is that the children were
between the ages of 4 and 12 years at the time it
was carried out. A crucial question lies in the
possible differences in the children's well-being
and family dynamics as they move into adolescence,
when more challenging issues of identity
become paramount. On the basis of these findings
the open and supportive parenting style
practised by the adopting parents is likely to have
more positive outcomes than the alternative,
although it is still not known whether or not it is
beneficial for adolescents.


<b><i>Transracial Adoption</i></b>


For children adopted from one culture into
another, there are additional issues of cultural
difference between them and their parents, especially
if they are beyond infancy at the time of
adoption and have significant experiences of
their birth culture. Physical differences may well
be apparent between parents and children. Singer
et al. (1985) noted that infants adopted transracially
were more likely than those adopted intraracially
to be insecurely attached at 18 months
old; however, this did not appear to be because of
lack of social support or problematic preplacement
history. They noted that most studies
of inter-racially adopted children indicate good
adjustment. Rather, they believed that the higher
rates of insecure attachment in transracially
adopted children occurred because it took more
time for parents to adapt to infants of a different
race, but that these initial differences became less
serious.


There is remarkably little research that compares
parenting by adoptive parents directly with
that of biological parents. This is perhaps
because it is only relatively recently that adoptive
families have become more visible with the
reduction in confidentiality and closed adoption.
Some studies of children born by artificial reproductive
technologies have included groups of
adoptive families (e.g. Golombok et al., 1999,
2001). These find few or no differences in
parenting practices between adoptive parents and
biological parents on a range of measures that
include emotional involvement, parental warmth
and dependability, and affection.


<b><i>Parenting in Foster Families</i></b>


For reasons discussed earlier, several factors suggest
that parenting in foster families will be more
difficult than in intact families. A significant
factor is the past history of the child. If she or he
is beyond the neonatal period then issues of
attachment arise, since attachments are typically
formed with care-givers from about six months
of age onward. Foster parents of children who
are beyond infancy, then, forge relationships
with children who have experienced the loss of at
least one important person in their lives with
whom they have had a primary relationship, even
if that relationship was insecure or unsatisfactory.
Furthermore, insecure relationships may
have been accompanied by inadequate care and
neglect. However, at least one study has found
that infants placed in foster care between birth
and 20 months of age form secure attachments
with foster parents at the same rate as biological
parent-infant pairs (Dozier et al., 2001). In these
early months, the role of age in determining
attachment formation is not clear. Younger
infants (6 to 12 months) seem to stabilize their
attachment behaviour relatively quickly in comparison
with older (12 to 20 months) infants
(Stovall and Dozier, 2000), but three months
after fostering, these age differences are not
apparent in the security of attachments formed.


Although there is little evidence available
about attachment formation in children fostered
beyond two years of age, we might expect that as
memory processes become more sophisticated
and experience of poor parenting is longer, so too
will difficulties increase. Indeed, rejection by
birth parents (which presumably reflects a poor
relationship) has been found to be a major predictor
of the breakdown of permanent placement
in unrelated families of children in middle childhood
(Rushton et al., 2000).


The second major factor in parenting in foster
families is the constellation of attitudes and
expectations held by the parents themselves,
including impermanence and the consequent
possible lack of emotional investment. In the studies
of early-fostered children mentioned above,

[p. <i>122</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00140&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Overall, parenting in foster families presents
potent difficulties for parents and children. Even
toddlers show subtle differences in their behaviour
and expectations of nurturing, and older
children, especially if they have experienced
adversity, come to the parent-child relationship
with anxieties about relating and often have
behaviour problems as a result of their experiences.
Foster parents too have low expectations
of permanence and of the possibilities of establishing
close and enduring relationships with
their children. The presence in foster families of
unrelated siblings also contributes to the challenges
faced in parenting in foster families.


<b><i>Parenting in Families Formed
by Artificial Reproductive
Technologies (ART)</i></b>


Perhaps because of the complexities anticipated
by the formation of families by ART, there is a
small but impressive body of recent and current
research from several countries that is addressing
the experience and well-being of these families
as they increase in number. In Australia, a
prospective study of women pregnant through
IVF treatment found high levels of anxiety
during pregnancy, and anticipation of infant difficulty,
in comparison with a control group of
naturally conceived infants (McMahon et al.,
1997). IVF infants were perceived as comparatively
difficult by their mothers when their
infants were 4 and 12 months of age (Gibson
et al., 1998). However, the authors note that
these anxieties were not unrealistic given the
high risks of failure inherent in such pregnancies
and, significantly, they did not lead to compromised
mother-infant interaction at 12 months
of age (McMahon et al., 1995). Attachments
between mothers and infants at one year were as
likely to be secure in the IVF group as in the
naturally conceived group (Gibson et al., 2000).


Parent-child relationships in families with
preschool children born by IVF in Belgium
(Colpin et al., 1995) and Holland (van Balen,
1996) have been compared with those of naturally
conceived parent-child pairs. No differences
were found in the Belgian group on
measures of parent-child relationship or parental
psychosocial functioning. Dutch IVF mothers
reported comparatively <i>higher</i> levels of emotional
involvement and parenting pleasure, and
saw their children as less obstinate and more
sociable than did the mothers of naturally conceived
children. They also reported low levels of
parenting stress. Taiwanese mothers and their
three- to seven-year-old children have also been
examined on measures of parenting and family
functioning (Hahn and DiPietro, 2001). Teacher
ratings of these families indicated that IVF
mothers showed greater warmth, but not overprotectiveness
or intrusiveness toward their
children. Teachers also reported fewer behaviour
problems in IVF than in naturally conceived
children. Mothers themselves reported high feelings
of protectiveness toward their children, but
apparently these feelings did not translate into
over-protective behaviour.


These findings clearly contradict the pessimistic
predictions that parenting in ART families will
be compromised by experiences of infertility
treatment, complicated genetic relationships, and
distorted parental perceptions of their much-wanted
children. Their enjoyment of parenting
and their positive perceptions of their children
indicate that their parenting practices are likely
to be optimal.


These cross-sectional studies are supported by
the findings of a longitudinal study of children
born by IVF, adopted children, and naturally conceived
children that has been carried out by
Golombok and her colleagues. The first assessment
when the children were between four and
eight years old (Golombok et al., 1995) found that
mothers of IVF children were warmer, more emotionally
involved, and experienced less parenting
stress than mothers of naturally conceived
children. Adoptive parents were similar to IVF
parents, leading the authors to conclude that a
strong desire for children is more important in relation
to good parenting than a genetic relationship.

[p. <i>123</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00141&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the children were 12 years old, these
families were examined again and perceptions
of children, parents and teachers obtained
(Golombok et al., 2001). Comparisons were
made between groups who had experienced
infertility (IVF and adopted versus naturally conceived)
and between IVF and adopted groups. At
this stage, parental behaviour was somewhat different.
Mothers in the infertility groups were
found to be less sensitively responding to their
adolescents than mothers in the natural conception
group, and fathers and mothers in the adoptive
families showed less warmth toward their
teenagers than those in the IVF families. On the
other hand, mothers who had experienced infertility
were seen by their children as more dependable
than those in the natural conception group.
In comparisons of control and discipline, however,
adolescents in families who had experienced
infertility saw their parents as less likely to
discuss issues with them than those who were
naturally conceived. On measures of child and
parent affection and emotional involvement, no
differences amongst groups were found.
Measures of disputes, discipline and aggression
showed no differences.


The few differences that were found, overall,
were both positive and negative but suggest that
as adolescence approaches, parental behaviour
may change in subtle ways. It is impossible to
determine from these studies whether these arise
from changes in adolescent behaviour and perceptions
or from changes in parental attitudes.
The children were in very early adolescence, and
we do not know whether differences in parenting
might escalate or diminish as they become older.
As with adopted children (and young people in
general), issues of identity become increasingly
salient. For ART teenagers, their biological identity
is particularly complicated.


The findings suggest, overall, that method of
conception is not a strong factor in determining
parenting practices and children's responses.
Support for this conclusion comes from comparisons
that have been made amongst three- to
eight-year-old children born by donor insemination
and egg donation in order to examine
degrees of genetic relatedness (Golombok et al.,
1999). Again, few differences were found, and
those that were found favoured families in which
there was no genetic link between mothers and
children.


To date, then, studies in a variety of countries
using a range of measures and informants indicate
that there are few systematic differences in
family functioning amongst families formed by
ART and those either adopted or naturally conceived.
This in turn indicates the probable
insignificance of this variable for parenting
practices. Predictions of over-protection and
unreasonable expectations of children are not
borne out by the evidence and, indeed, ART
parents appear to be less stressed by parenting
and warmer and happier as parents than those
with naturally conceived children. Van Balen
suggests that 'a coherent picture arises: there are
many similarities between IVF families and normally
fertile families, but when differences are
found, the situation appears to be better in IVF
families' (van Balen, 1998).


However, caution is necessary since we have
no studies that follow children into middle and
late adolescence, a period when questions of
identity become paramount and when family
cohesion usually decreases. In stepfamilies,
parent-adolescent relationships often become
more vexed than in intact families (Hetherington,
1993) and, for possibly different reasons, this
may happen also in ART families. We have yet
to learn whether openness about young people's
genetic origins will affect their acceptance and
adjustment toward their varied inheritance as
they come to terms with the existence of a variety
of parents including genetic, carrying and
nurturing fathers and mothers. In the meantime,
research is encouraging in providing evidence
for the capacities of ART parents to provide supportive
family environments for their children.


<b>WHAT CAN WE COWCLUDE?</b>


It is important to remember that even within the
same grouping, such as stepfamilies or adoptive
families, there are likely to be variations that are
disguised by the overall findings. Nevertheless,
the overall findings are the best bases we have
for making evidence-based comments about
reconstituted and surrogate families.


It is apparent that parenting in lone-parent and
stepfamilies compares adversely with that in
intact families. However, these differences are
notable mainly in the early phases after the transition
from the previous family structure, and
even out as family situations become more stable -
usually about two years later.


Families that have experienced multiple transitions
are particularly at risk in this regard. The
little evidence we have regarding foster families
suggests that parent-child relationships may be
somewhat fraught, because of parental expectations
and the child's past history.


There is substantial support, though, for concluding
that at least in childhood the quality of
parenting in adoptive and especially in ART

[p. <i>124</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00142&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

First, family structure <i>in itself</i> is not predictive
of parenting quality. The differences where they
do exist between lone-parent, step-parent and
intact family households largely disappear over
time, and are accounted for by other factors such
as the disruption associated with transitions and
the formation of new household structures, conflict,
a reduction in household income, but not
with the presence or absence of two biological
parents of both sexes. The evidence from open
adoption, too, suggests that the traditional structure
of nuclear families is in itself unimportant
for parenting. Children are able to encompass
several parenting figures into their lives successfully,
as they do in stepfamilies and in open
adoption. The key to their success, however,
seems to lie in the ability of adults to manage
their own relationships well. An important caveat
here is that these findings apply predominantly
to the childhood years. The situation may be different
for adolescents, as has been indicated
throughout this chapter.


Children's perspectives on families are informative
in this regard. When asked whether particular
groupings of individuals constitute families, they
are remarkably accepting and pragmatic, with a
considerable majority seeing loneÃºparent (whether
mother or father), stepfamily groupings, families
with gay and lesbian parents, and cohabiting parents
and children as legitimate families (Gilby and
Pederson, 1982; O'Brien et al., 1996; Anyan and
Pryor, 2002). Table 8.2 shows the levels of
endorsement of family types by 232 adolescents in
a recent New Zealand study. So it is adults and
communities that are likely to have problems with
non-traditional family households and to be the
sources of stigma that might have an impact on the
well-being of children in these families.


Second, biology and genetic relationships do
not appear to be important predictors of parenting.
Adoptive parents, especially those who adopted
their children in infancy, and ART parents are
quite as competent, involved and committed to
their children as are biological parents. Where differences
exist, they are usually in favour of ART
parents. Although this should come as no surprise
when we consider the long historical view of
families and parenthood and the variation in religious
and social structures, it does not support a
view of parenting that is often applied to troubled
step-parent-stepchild relationships, that biological
<br />
<img src="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?api=new&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I006&amp;maxwidth=640" /><br />

What, then, <i>does</i> matter? The evidence points
to family members' histories of relationships and
change as being central to the quality of parent-
child relationships. For parents, transitions
present stresses and challenges that sap their
emotional and other resources, and jeopardize
their ability to parent consistently, and the evidence
is clear that parenting deteriorates during
and after structural change in a household.
Moreover, the number of relationship changes
parents themselves have experienced before their
current partnership is linked with the quality of
their parent-child relationships, and with the
relationships their partners have with their
children (Dunn et al., 2000). The findings discussed
here of reduced quality of parenting in the
initial phases for lone-parent and step-parent
families, and the significant problems faced by
children whose parents have had several transitions,
support the conclusion that adult transitions
are a significant risk factor for their
children, presumably through their impact on
parents' own state and parenting practices.


For children, transitions often mean changes in
relationships, with the loss of some relationships,
and the sometimes-unwanted acquisition of others.
For children in foster families and those who are
adopted after infancy, their history of previous
relationships and adverse parenting are significant
in shaping their relationships with their new parents.
A central mechanism is likely to be the loss of
significant attachment figures, especially fathers,
mothers or both. When these losses are multiple
then children's abilities to form secure relationships
with parenting figures are undermined.

[p. <i>125</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00143&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The major corollary of this is that stability of
relationships is a crucial aspect of parenting and
well-being for children. From the children's
perspective, the <i>quality</i> of the relationships they
have with parents and others is of course important,
and there are instances where a relationship
is best severed. However, the avoidance of loss
or diminution, where possible and appropriate, is
clearly in children's best interests. For parents,
stability of supportive relationships and the
absence of change and loss buttress their ability
to parent effectively. The fact that parenting
practices settle down in lone-parent and stepfamilies
over time indicates that stability
increases the ability of both adults and children
to sustain reasonable parent-child relationships.


<i><b>Developmental Considerations</b></i>


It is apparent that the age of children is a major
factor in considering parenting practices in the
diverse families considered in this chapter. The
capacities, cognitions and needs of children at
different ages and stages call for developmentally
sensitive approaches to parenting. There is
also the cumulative impact of earlier experiences
as children grow up that needs to be considered.
In particular, unsatisfactory or abusive early relationships
can affect the ways in which children
form subsequent relationships in their lives.


Young children are especially vulnerable to
the making and breaking of significant relationships.
Their ability to trust themselves and others
in relational matters is substantially established
in the early years. Sensitive, responsive parenting
is essential to the establishment of trust and
security, and although insecure relationships are
not necessarily predictive of later difficulties,
repeated experiences of insecure and disrupted
attachments can put them at risk for later difficulties
with relationships and self-concept. In the
early years, children are typically egocentric in
their dealings with the world. This confers the
risk of self-blame when things go wrong, a phenomenon
often noted when parents separate.


In middle childhood the establishment of
friendships with peers becomes paramount. Poor
peer relations are associated with both difficulties
at home, including those associated with
poor parenting, and with unsatisfactory functioning,
such as low self-esteem. Hence children in
this age group thrive in peer-related and school-related
activities when their parents are able to
provide effective parenting at home.


Adolescence, as we have seen repeatedly in
this chapter, is an especially vulnerable time for
identity and self-concept. Cognitive changes mean
that teenagers are able to imagine alternatives to
the ways they and the world might be, and to
think in abstract ways. There is typically an
intense focus on questions of who they are as
physical and psychological changes occur. For
these reasons, it is perhaps not surprising that
there is some evidence that adopted adolescents
and their families face challenges in their relationships
(Howe, 1996), although as yet the
experiences of adolescents in ART families have
not been examined. For those adopted and ART
children who are aware of their different origins,
questions of genetic identity will become important,
as they enter adolescence, in regard to their
physical changes, their personalities and other
characteristics.


A second characteristic of adolescence is the
emergence of the need for autonomy from parents.
In stepfamilies, parent-adolescent relationships
deteriorate to a greater extent than they do in
intact families (Hetherington and Jodl, 1994) and
this is especially the case if children are going
through adolescence when their stepfamily is
formed. Many of them never establish a satisfactory
relationship with a step-parent. For these
young people, the pressure to accept the parenting
of an adult who has not been a part of their
earlier lives comes up against their developing
autonomy, creating disruption in family relationships.
It is no coincidence that adolescents in
stepfamilies are more likely to leave home, and
to leave home because of conflict, than those in
lone-parent or intact families (Kiernan, 1992).


<b><i>Implications for Parenting Practice</i></b>


In several ways these findings are cause for optimism.
If structural conformity and biological
relationships were necessary aspects of good
parenting, then the rapidly increasing diversity
of family forms would be alarming. However,
families formed by ART, stepfamilies, and
adoptive families are becoming increasingly
numerous and the findings reported here suggest
that such families have the potential to be, and in
many cases are, robust and healthy environments
for children. The major challenges for society are
to reduce suspicion and stigmatization of 'differ
ent' families, and to find effective ways to promote
stability in relationships for children.


This last point does not imply that dysfunctional
or unhappy families should be discouraged
from dissolving. It does mean, however, that
although parents divorce each other, they do not or
should not divorce their children. It also suggests
that support for parents and parenting at the time
of transitions such as separation and stepfamily

[p. <i>126</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000086813-I00144&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The task for parents in all families is to maintain
practices that include love and support, monitoring
and boundary setting, and promotion of
healthy development. In families that are the
result of structural transitions, such as loneparent
and stepfamilies, there are the added challenges
of maintaining parenting throughout
stressful events, and of minimizing instability.
In lone-parent families, continuing contact,
where appropriate (that is, when issues of abuse,
for example, do not exist), with non-resident
parents contributes to the stability of relationships
for children and the sharing of the parenting
load for parents. It is also important for both
parents to maintain consistent monitoring and to
co-operate as far as possible in order to avoid
children 'playing parents off against each other
in areas of discipline. It is sometimes tempting to
be lenient or inconsistent with children through
feelings of guilt, or lack of energy, or fear of
alienating them. Children also need reassurance
that their parents have not and will not stop loving
them even though they may have stopped
loving each other.


The formation of a stepfamily is usually a
second transition for children and their biological
parents, and introduces a third parenting adult
into the children's lives, at least potentially. The
research evidence and clinical writing suggest
that stepfathers parent best by being friendly,
supportive, but relatively uninvolved in monitoring
and discipline. Stepchildren prefer to view
step-parents as friends rather than parents
(Buchanan et al, 1996; Funder, 1996), especially
if they are teenagers, and tend to resent attempts
at control by stepfathers.


Although still sparse, the evidence suggests that
in adoptive, foster and ART families openness
about biological origins is helpful for parent-child
relationships. Adolescents are less likely to face
crises of identity if they have good social and biological
information about all their parents. This
suggests the importance of telling children early
about their origins, and providing as much information
as possible for them as they need it for
developing full and satisfying self-concepts.


These considerations lead to the following

<b>AUTHOR'S VIEW</b>


As family structures become more diverse, so too
do parenting arrangements and practices.
Children are parented by a wide variety of people,
including same-sex couples, unrelated but committed
adults, extended family members, older
siblings, teachers and mentors. Attempts to curtail
diversity are at best misguided and may lead
at worst to the imposition of continuing misery
on unhappy families, as in attempts to stop
divorce or return to fault-based divorce. Social
stigmatization of same-sex, adopting and stepfamilies
is similarly misguided and undermines
families' efforts to find their own best ways of
supporting their members. History tells us that
nothing much has changed. We have merely
found more ingenious ways to form families in
order to adapt to the changes and demands we
face. As secrecy becomes both less possible and
less desirable, children and families deserve
information, respect, and full support as they
adapt and thrive.


Parenting, in its broadest sense, remains
pivotal to the well-being of children and is the
conduit through which most other factors impinge
upon them. The major elements of unconditional
love and respect, monitoring and boundary setting,
and fostering good development, apply across all
settings. Recognition and respect for the diversity
of settings in which they are applied is essential if
we are to socialize our children as well-functioning
adults in a rapidly changing world. This means
moving beyond limiting notions of family
