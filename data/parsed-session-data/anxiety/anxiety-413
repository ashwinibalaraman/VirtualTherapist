IT SEEMED that I had been in psychotherapy all my adult life.
In fact, I had been for a considerable portion of it. Four years
of individual therapy with Carl and nearly two years of
group therapy and still I was slipping perceptibly downhill.
I was in real despair over my apparent failure to become
more competent in managing my life and my happiness.
The repetitive, tiresome pendulum of depression and anxiety
swung back and forth in my life, pausing only briefly at
the point of balance. It ground me down bit by bit until I
felt I could stand it no longer.


I had tried all Saturday morning to reach Carl. I called his
office, his home, and his answering service. But I couldn't
find him. I was in a state of near collapse. I had slept little
for three nights with continual panic attacks alternating
with agitated periods of depression. My wife had taken the
children and left the house. She knew, and I knew, that I
couldn't maintain my composure in front of them. More
and more often over the past few months I had been forced
to retreat to my bedroom and lock the door. I'd stay there
for hours, sometimes doing nothing, but often crying and

[p. <i>178</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00193&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Sometimes I would leave the house for work feeling pretty
good and chipper. But an hour later at the office I would
feel so terrible and have so little control over myself that I
couldn't even carry on a lucid conversation. At those times
I would ask my secretary to take my calls and to tell visitors
that I was out. However, an hour or so later, I would be able
to return my calls and take care of the ordinary affairs of the
day. It got to be like an unpredictable, horrible roller coaster
ride.


Somehow the weekends were always worst. Saturday was
bad, but Sunday was horrible. I would wake up, usually in
a start, and feel so restless and anxious that I'd have to get
up even when I hadn't slept enough. Still I felt pretty fair.
After two or three cups of coffee and a doughnut or two, I'd
begin to feel shaky and anxious, and my guts would tremble.
Along about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, I'd
feel so uptight and so driven that I would be frantic. It
didn't happen every weekend, but over the past few months
it had become more frequent and more intense. Somehow
weekdays weren't usually quite so bad. Naturally, I thought
it must be because I had nothing to do on the weekends.
Perhaps the fact that I had to work Monday through Friday
helped to keep me together and functioning on those days,
I thought.


But, for whatever reasons, things were getting tougher for
me. I had almost lost the ability to sleep through the night.
Sometimes I couldn't go to sleep at all. Other times I would
awaken and be unable to go back to sleep. I was bone-tired
all the time. In the morning I would get up and shave and

[p. <i>179</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00194&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

<b>Increasing panic</b>


I had more frequent attacks of agitated panic culminating
in feelings of impending death and in near unconsciousness.
These attacks were unpredictable and seemingly unrelated
to what was going on around me. They could happen in
periods of stress or while I was having fun at a party. They
happened at work when I was alone or at a meeting when
I was with other people. I wracked my brain to try to understand
what dynamic significance these attacks must have. I
worked at trying to penetrate my unconscious and to ferret
out the terrible things that must be going on there. I really
almost drove myself crazy analyzing every event and all the
people around me, belaboring my feelings, motives, and
thoughts until I trusted no one, especially myself.


The attacks were not only coming more frequently, but
they were more violent, lasted longer, and depleted me for
two or three days afterward. Up until the last few weeks
these episodes were marked by generalized anxiety, fatigue,
and feelings of depression and lethargy. But now the attacks
were getting a little more difficult to manage.


I was in the building library one morning looking for a
reference book I needed. As I went through some book titles

[p. <i>180</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00195&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As I plopped down in my chair I thought to myself,
"You're the craziest son of a bitch that ever lived. Looking
through a stack of books causes you to go into a state of
agitated panic. A bastard as crazy as you ought to be dead."
By now, of course, I was talking to myself as if I were really
someone else. My agitation increased. I began to hyperventilate,
and I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I
felt like I was going to die. I was gasping for breath, thinking
that I was going to lose consciousness any minute. I was
in a devastating panic of fear. I was so weak that I couldn't
get up from my chair. So I sat there in fear and trembling,
feeling as if I would die at any moment.


This lasted about thirty minutes. But it left me so debilitated
and depleted that I felt weak and sick for two or three
days afterward.


My feelings now fell within a narrow range. I felt like hell
all of the time, or worse. The episodes were more clearly
defined now; rather than being vague and chronic, they
were acute and pronounced. If they occurred when I was in
a group, I would leave and try to get home or at least to my
office, where I could hide out for the onslaught. If I was in
a car driving, I would have to pull over and park. Then I
would lie down on the front seat, almost in a stupor, until
the attack passed and I could drive again.


Even between attacks I was functioning only marginally.
I had a chronic, mild headache that was always worse in the
morning. I was always weak and tired, but the symptom
that bothered me the most was the disturbance in my equilibrium

[p. <i>181</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00196&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had learned through sad experience that alcohol was
devastating for me. If I had a few drinks when I was tired
and tense, I would soon have a bonafide depressive condition.
And hangovers were real dillies! Even after only a few
drinks at a party, I would wake at two or three in the
morning with a pounding headache and a stomach that felt
as if it were going to crawl out of my throat. So I had learned
over the past year or so that I simply couldn't drink liquor.
And I seldom did.


<b>So, see a doctor</b>


As I look over what I have written, I can see the reader
saying, "Why didn't you see a physician? Something was
physically wrong." Well, I did. I saw several doctors. I complained
of chronic headache, sleeplessness, anxiety, panic
attacks, giving each one a long list of symptoms to consider.
And they all thought, just as I did, that these symptoms
were related to depression or depressive equivalents. Several
recommended shock treatments. I even tried to convince my
psychotherapist, Carl, that the only thing left for me to try
was shock treatments. He resisted the idea, thinking that
even if I got relief, it would only permit me to avoid dealing
with those conflicts in my life that were causing my troubles.


But he was perplexed too. "I really don't understand," he
said to me once. "You have made excellent progress in your
psychotherapy. You should be functioning more effectively,
more freely." He sent me to see a physician too.

[p. <i>182</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00197&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During these months and years I probably had every kind
of medicine prescribed for me that is available for psychotropic
purposes. I took Tofranil, an antidepressant; Mellaril,
a tranquilizer; Librium, a tranquilizer; and Sinequan, an
antidepressant and tranquilizer. At one time or another, I
was tried on virtually every psychotropic medication, especially
tranquilizers and antidepressants, that was available.
The only one of all I took that seemed to have any effect in
the least was Dexamyl. This is an amphetamine preparation
with a little sedative in it. In other words, a "pep pill." At
times a Dexamyl would pull me out of an incapacitating
depressive-panic episode in a matter of minutes. However,
it didn't last long. I was sorely tempted many times to take
them more often than prescribed. But I never exceeded the
prescribed dosage. The rest of the medication appeared to be
of no help whatsoever.


In spite of any medication and regardless of the fact that
my psychotherapy was going well, I was getting worse. In
a sense, the old saw, "The operation was a success, but the
patient died," applied in my case.


<b>The last of the last straws</b>


Finally that Saturday morning Carl returned my call. He
listened patiently to my reiteration (for he had heard it
many times before from me) of my condition and my desperation.
"Well, R.," he said, "I don't know what else you
can do if you can't go on. I can put you in a hospital; we can
try shock treatment." I protested, "But I don't want to do
that." I went on, "Let me try a course of Tofranil again. It's
been several years since I tried it." Carl sighed audibly on
the phone, "All right, R., I'll call in a prescription for it." So
once again I tried medicine, and once again, there were no
appreciable results.

[p. <i>183</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00198&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After my frantic call to Carl, two events occurred, several
months apart, that finally resulted in the action that was to
change the course of my life. Both were critical, but I didn't
perceive their full significance at the time.


My wife and I were invited to a party at a hunting lodge
in the country. We got there about six o'clock in the evening.
We met some old friends and were introduced to some
new ones. We both accepted a drink; mine was bourbon and
water. We talked, told jokes, danced, and listened to music
awhile. By 9:30 I was ravenously hungry, but dinner wasn't
ready. I remember mixing a fourth drink and thinking that
I'd better not have another without some food. That's the
last thing I remember until sometime the next day. The rest
of the party, coming back home, and going to bed were not
in my memory. I woke up about 10 a.m. with the familiar
pounding in my head and trembling in my stomach. It took
awhile before it dawned on me that I had no recollection of
anything after mixing that fourth drink at the party. I was
informed by my wife that I had really made an ass of myself
during the course of the evening. I asked her to spare me the
details. I was profoundly shaken. I had walked, talked, and
otherwise behaved in some fashion for twelve hours, and I
had no remembrance of any of it. I was perplexed and
frightened, and I seldom had a drink of any alcoholic beverage
after that.


The second event also helped me to see the possible significance
of physical facts affecting my behavior.


I had awakened one morning about 2:30. These early
morning interruptions of my sleep were becoming commonplace,
occurring once or twice a week. With a start my eyes
jumped open and I lay there in the dark with the old familiar
feeling of trembling in my guts and panic in my mind. As
usual, I began hyperventilating and sweating. I got out of
bed prepared to tough it out as I usually did until the episode

[p. <i>184</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00199&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I got up and went to the kitchen ready to pace the floor,
as I usually did, alternating between cursing and moaning
and otherwise acting like a wounded animal. I was thirsty,
and as I started to get a drink of water from the faucet, I saw
a pitcher of orange juice that had been left on the counter.
I don't really care much for juice, but for some reason I
poured with trembling hands a full glass of juice and drank
it. I resumed my pacing and ruminating.


"It's in my imagination," I said to myself, "or is my
stomach really calming down?" During these times, my
guts felt like they were crawling around in my belly. In
another minute or two I could feel my bodily musculature
relaxing. I sat down. Soon my headache was gone and I felt
calmer and easier than I had for months. "Well, I'll be
damned," I said to myself again. "I am as relaxed and comfortable
as if I had been shot full of some sedatives. Could
a little sugar in orange juice do that?" I was truly astounded
and perplexed. I had the first feeble thought that perhaps,
just maybe, I wasn't totally crazy. It might just be possible
that I had physical problems as well as emotional ones.


I treated the next attack with sugar. Two days later at
work I felt weak and trembly and anxious. I got a Coke and
some cookies. Sure enough, in a few minutes I was okay
again. I had known for a long time that if I could eat a big
meal, I would feel better. But sometimes I was so sick I
couldn't eat. For several months prior to my discovery, or
realization, of the role of sugar in my feelings, I had been
eating candy like a starved five-year-old. I kept hard candy
on my desk and ate as much as a half pound of it in a day.

[p. <i>185</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00200&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I satisfied myself through repeated trials over the next
few weeks that sugar was doing something to me. What, I
didn't know. But what to do about it? As soon as I go to a
physician and he finds out my history of emotional problems,
he'll prescribe another tranquilizer and that will be it.


<b>Another diagnosis</b>


Then it occurred to me that I should try my family physician,
the man who treats our colds, sore throats, and pulled
muscles. I made an appointment and went to see him. I
reviewed my history of emotional problems and told him of
my discovery of the effect that food, especially sugar, had
on me. I asked him to please examine me physically and
ignore psychological factors. He agreed and drew some
blood for tests.


"Your blood sugar is 65," he said. "And that's somewhat
low. Come back on Wednesday and we'll run a glucose
tolerance test to see if you are having a metabolic problem."


On Wednesday I went back to his office, having skipped
breakfast according to his instructions. I drank a bottle of
flavored sugar water at 9 a.m. and sat down to read a magazine.
The technician took blood samples periodically. At
9:30 I felt fine. At 10 o'clock everything was okay. By 10:30
I was feeling a bit shaky, and by 11 o'clock I was so sick I
could hardly sit up.


I went back the next day to see the doctor for the results.
"Well!" he said thoughtfully, looking at the folder on his
desk, "you really can't handle sugar. Your count was down
to 40 two hours after you took the glucose." He explained
that a normal blood sugar ranges from 80 to 110. He looked

[p. <i>186</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00201&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The test a week later showed the same results. I was in a
state of turmoil. Was it possible that at least some part of
my trouble was physically rather than psychologically
caused? I was fearful, yet hopeful, for I had had my hopes
crushed too many times before by expectations about drugs
that didn't work, or by spurious feelings of short-lived episodes
of well-being. I was cautious, but I felt in my gut
there was hope.


"I think I'd better send you to Dr. H., a specialist in
metabolic disorders," Dr. B. said. "What do I do in the
meantime?" I asked. "Well," he replied thoughtfully, "you
need to keep your sugar level up. Why don't you eat or
drink something sweet about every two hours."


It so happens that my condition, reactive hypoglycemia,
is badly aggravated by sugar. A rapid infusion of sugar in
the blood stimulates the pancreas to release insulin, which
is necessary in metabolizing sugar. However, in reactive
hypoglycemia, the pancreas over-reacts to sugar and releases
too much insulin, depleting the blood sugar and dropping
it to dangerously low levels. When that happens, as I
later discovered, the brain is deprived of its only fuel, sugar,
and myriad symptoms such as weakness, dizziness, anxiety,
sweating, hunger, or even nausea can occur. Of course, if the
sugar level continues to drop, coma and even death can
ensue. But this never happens in reactive hypoglycemia because
the body responds to this emergency with adrenalin,
which causes the liver to release additional sugar into the
blood and which, incidentally, may cause anxiety, hyperventilation,
palpitations, and feelings of impending death.


So you can see, as I can now, that by taking sugar every

[p. <i>187</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00202&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After about a day and a half of eating or drinking some
sugar every two hours, I was nearly a basket case. "My God,
I can't continue with this: I'll die or go completely nuts," I
told my wife. I was shaking and quivering and stammering
by then. "I'll quit the sugar bit entirely." Of course, that
turned out to be a fortunate decision. My symptoms subsided
and I made it to the endocrinologist. By taking such
large quantities of sugar I was causing an excessive outpouring
of insulin by the pancreas, which in turn was rapidly
depleting the glucose level in my blood. The body responds
to this emergency with an outpouring of epinephrine,
which stimulates the release of stored supplies of sugar in
the liver. However, epinephrine is a powerful stimulant. "A
characteristic pattern in hypoglycemia is tachycardia, anxiety,
sweating, pallor, and rise of blood pressure," according
to Beeson and McDermott in the <i>Textbook of Medicine</i>.


<b>A change of direction</b>


The exhaustive tests that followed added no really new
information to the diagnosis. I had a common form of reactive
hypoglycemia with no signs of a tumor or other agent
that was causing it. My problem was not entirely physical
by any means. I am certain that years of stress, anxiety,
fearfulness, and bitter resentment caused my body to have
to operate under emergency conditions much of the time.
It's not difficult to see that this could result in a disturbed
metabolism. But one certainly contributed to the other. The
devastation done to my psychological functioning by the
hypoglycemic episodes was profound. In <i>Body, Mind, and
Sugar</i>, Dr. S. A. Portis is quoted as describing the symptoms

[p. <i>188</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00203&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had become convinced that I was a hopeless nut, that I
would never master my own destiny. I was certain that my
unconscious was thick with entangled and ensnarled hostilities
and frustrations. I had no trust in myself and no
confidence in what tomorrow might bring. I never knew
when I might break down or finally crack up and have to be
"put away."


I was continually afraid that I would give up and destroy
myself in utter despair. I was afraid to really be with other
people for fear they would see my misery and anxiety. My
speech was a dead giveaway. At times I could hardly talk.
My mind could not coordinate my thinking with my
tongue. I stuttered and stammered. I developed the habit of
long pauses in responding to someone in order to give myself
time to think about how I would respond and how I
would get my mouth to say what I wanted it to say. It was
a long time before I could be persuaded that such severe
symptoms could result from something as innocuous
sounding as "low blood sugar." However, in the thirteenth
edition of the <i>Textbook of Medicine</i> by Beeson and McDermott,
hypoglycemia symptoms are described fully. They "may
take the form of confusion, hallucinations, aimless hyperactivity,
or even convulsions." The only positive thing I can
think of that came out of my experience of hypoglycemia
is that I learned how much I can take if I have to, and I
learned what misery some people have endured. I hope it
has contributed to my ability to be compassionate toward

[p. <i>189</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00204&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The diagnostic work at the hospital confirmed the diagnosis.
The treatment was simple. I could take no sugar at all
and had to strictly limit my intake of other carbohydrates.
In effect, this meant I had to follow a high protein diet. Also,
I could not drink alcoholic beverages. What a small price to
pay for a new life! Within just a few days I began to feel
better. However, all was not clear sailing; I still had occasional
hypoglycemic attacks even on the diet. But they were
fewer and less severe. Also, I reacted to them less emotionally.
Since I knew what was happening, it was much less
frightening. As the weeks and months went by the attacks
subsided and I began to feel normal again. I was able to start
a day with a relative certainty that I would finish it feeling
about as I did when I started it. I began to sleep all night and
to wake up refreshed and able to look forward to the day.


I stopped all medication when the hypoglycemia was
diagnosed. After nearly three years, I have not taken a single
tranquilizer, antidepressant, or stimulant, and I have not
needed to. My condition has stabilized to what Freud called
"normal unhappiness." The problems of work and life and
living are just as great for me as they are for anyone else. But
no greater.


It took over a year of steady and conscientious dieting
before I no longer was subject to unexpected swings of
mood or attacks of fatigue and depression. After that year,
I discontinued psychotherapy and have not needed to return
for help.


The sun shines brighter and the days are sweeter. My
work is mostly a challenge rather than a chore, and my
energy is available for me to use rather than consumed in
merely living. The dread for what the future might bring

[p. <i>190</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00205&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I look back on those days with wonder and not with
bitterness. I feel like a condemned criminal who has been
unexpectedly pardoned. I am too thankful to be fully alive
to indulge myself in regret. It's almost as if I have had two
lifetimes. One filled with anger, despair, and fear and one
with pleasure, accomplishment, and happiness. I know that
I have been given a chance to use my life and now I have
a brand new but more pleasant problem. How will I use it?


<b>Hypoglycemia explained</b>


"Hypoglycemia exists when the blood glucose concentration
falls below 50 mg. per 100 ml.," according to Beeson
and McDermott. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be
caused by a number of things. In the diabetic who is taking
insulin it may be caused by too much insulin with too little
food, causing a precipitous drop in blood sugar. It can be the
result of a tumor in the pancreas causing the islets to release
an oversupply of insulin in the blood, dropping sugar levels.
There are also other disease processes which can result in
hypoglycemia. However, the most common cause of hypoglycemic
episodes is the reactive variety. Some authorities,
such as Marble and associates, feel that hypoglycemia is a
result of rather than a cause of emotional stress and psychological
problems. In <i>Diabetes Mellitus</i> Joslin says, "Since it is
often associated with anxiety or emotional upsets, it is
sometimes difficult to separate symptoms due to hypoglycemia
from those related to anxiety; in fact, there is some
discussion as to whether this type of hypoglycemia is the
result of rather than the cause of anxiety." Whatever causes
it, however, chronic hypoglycemia or repeated acute attacks

[p. <i>191</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00206&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Prolonged and chronic hypoglycemia can lead to cerebral
damage. When blood sugar drops to frank hypoglycemic
levels, gross and fine neurological disturbances can occur.
Contrary to the generally accepted belief that episodes of
hypoglycemia are brief and only transitory when blood
sugar levels are corrected, I can testify to the fact that the
debilitating effects of a single episode can last for several
hours or even days when the attack has been especially
severe or prolonged. Raising blood sugar levels does alleviate
the acute and most distressing symptoms, but the effect
on body and mind can persist in a most distressing fashion
for some time afterward.


The symptoms associated with hypoglycemia are so varied,
confusing, and often so subtle that persons suffering
from the condition have been diagnosed and treated for
every imaginable ailment. Abrahamson and Pezet say, "Persons
who at last were found to be suffering from hyperinsulinism
have been treated for coronary thrombosis and
other heart ailments, brain tumors, epilepsy, gall bladder
disease, appendicitis, and every sort of neurosis. They have
been told repeatedly that their trouble is ‘all in the mind’
and sent to the psychoanalyst."


It is also easy to see that the disorder may develop quite
slowly and persist in its course over a long period of time.
In fact, someone suffering from hypoglycemia may become
so accustomed to his symptoms that for him life itself is just
a long series of fatiguing events interspersed with attacks of
collapse and exhaustion. Often such persons are dismissed
with the casual description of "constitutionally frail" or
"hysterical exhaustion." Finally some crisis, or even an unrelated
illness, may reveal the fact that some of these persons
have a "real" reason to feel as they do. The gradual

[p. <i>192</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000653214-I00207&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

What is the contribution of the emotional life to this
physically debilitating condition? The question can be complex
if one considers every possible case and the intricate
circumstances of each life affected by it. But they all seem
to have a common denominator: namely, a disquieting lack
of inner peace and comfort. Invariably, sufferers are hard
driving, hard worrying, fear-driven, or hopeless people. The
one thing they all lack is peace of mind. They are not in tune
with themselves or their world. They harbor hate, resentment,
and destructive aggression. They are afraid in a world
which seems cold and heartless. They often see no possibility
of safety, security, and warmth. They perceive their own
heart dimly and insist that what is in their soul must be in
yours and mine, and they are afraid.


I can see clearly now that my initial attacks of anxiety and
depression were related to hypoglycemic episodes. These
instances led eventually to my hospitalization for depression.
I cannot honestly claim that these attacks were the
cause of my depression and that I would have been spared
my subsequent suffering if it had been detected and treated
at that time. But I do wonder what course my life might
have taken if it had.
