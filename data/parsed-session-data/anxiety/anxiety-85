<b>The article that follows is part
of the <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin's</i>
ongoing <i>First Person Accounts</i> series.
We hope that mental health
professionals—the <i>Bulletin's</i> primary
audience—will take this
opportunity to learn about the
issues and difficulties confronted
by consumers of mental health
care. In addition, we hope that
these accounts will give patients
and families a better sense of
not being alone in confronting
the problems that can be anticipated
by persons with serious
emotional difficulties. We welcome
other contributions from
patients, ex-patients, or family
members. Our major editorial requirement
is that such contributions
be clearly written and
organized, and that a novel or
unique aspect of schizophrenia
be described, with special
emphasis on points that will be
important for professionals.
Clinicians who see articulate patients,
with experiences they believe
should be shared, might
encourage these patients to submit

While we all know that stigmatization
of the mentally ill exists and
that it is always harmful, there is
a kind of stigma that is actually
more damaging than that inflicted
by others. It is the all-too-real
process and phenomenon of "self-stigmatization"
whereby mentally
ill individuals torture themselves
to an extent that exceeds what
they suffer from the very worst
that society-at-large can dish out
to them.


By way of illustration, I will attempt
to describe how I dealt with
such an overwhelmingly negative
self-image by sharing with the
reader some personal life events—
both concrete and psychological—
that resulted from my having experienced
an acute psychotic
episode. Have I ever incurred a
more specific diagnosis? Definitely!
In fact, I managed to accumulate
at least half a dozen different diagnoses,
and so the only apparent
truth is that late in 1985 I experienced
an acute psychotic
episode.


This episode led to my first
(and only, to date) psychiatric hospitalization.
Therefore, at the age
of 40 years, I heard myself being
referred to as a "chronically mentally
ill" individual, that is, just
another "CMI." This was news
to me, and the impact of its implications
had an almost totally
catastrophic effect upon me! I will
cite a few pertinent instances in
which I inflicted unnecessary pain
upon myself because of self-stigmatization.


When I first joined Fountain
House, a psychosocial rehabilitation
facility, early in January 1986, I
was in hiding from everyone. I
perceived myself, quite accurately,
unfortunately, as having a serious
mental illness and therefore as
having been relegated to what I
called "the social garbage heap."


Accordingly, from 9:00 a.m. to
4:00 p.m., 5 days a week, I could
hide from the cruelty of social
stigmatization by being within
Fountain House. At all other
times, however, especially when I
was not in my house, I tortured

[p. <i>408</i>]

Thus, I would do things such as
standing away from others at bus
stops and hiding and cringing in
the far corners of subway cars.
Thinking of myself as garbage, I
would even leave the sidewalk in
what I thought of as exhibiting
the proper deference to those
above me in social class. The latter
group, of course, included all
other human beings.


Such examples illustrate the severe
harm I had suffered. However,
I now fully realize that the
damage I had inflicted upon myself
via self-stigmatization was due
to the fact that I fully believed my
thoughts were true!


Although the Fountain House
environment helped me to overcome
this severe psychological
handicap, it took years of intense
internal struggling. Thankfully, I
have been largely victorious in this
psychological battle within myself.


Returning to school meant
changing jobs because of travel
time factors. Thus, my next job
consisted of working the 4:00 p.m.
to midnight shift at a local convenience
store, which, especially
on Saturday nights, often meant
working until 2:00 a.m. without
overtime pay (I did not care because
I felt lucky to be employed).


I also enrolled in another group
dynamics class where, of course, a
participant will derive little or no
benefit unless he or she is willing
and able to engage in self-disclosure.
This often involves revealing
intimate details of one's
personal, inner life. Thus, I told
my fellow group members much
about my mental illness—my experiences
with it, how I felt about
it, and what I thought my future
would be like.


Still, did I cure myself of thinking
poorly of myself because of
this very considerable victory? I
believe you know the answer by
now is a resounding "No"! It definitely
helped, but I was not cured,
nor will I ever be cured of all the
very insidious and multitudinous
aspects of self-stigmatization. Nevertheless,
the more battles I win,
the more I can enjoy being alive. I
am referring to life satisfaction and
the quality of my life.


For instance, I no longer feel
that my neighbors dislike and disapprove
of me. I now realize that
they perceived me as being standoffish
and rejecting of them because
of my own self-imposed seclusive
behaviors.


After several months at Fountain
House, I went to work at my first
Transitional Employment Program
(TEP) job. As with any Fountain
House TEP job, my coworkers
knew of my mental illness. Thus,
from the start I was accepted by
all of them, as they were accustomed
to members of Fountain
House coming and going at this
job. But, after I had proved to
them that I would not only do my
share of the work but would always
help them out whenever
they had an overload, they repeatedly
told me how much they liked
and appreciated me.


Therefore, after having been at
this job for 8 months, one would
think, especially in light of all my
coworkers' positive regard, that I
would have formed a better opinion
of myself and the world in
which I moved. But I most
emphatically had not!


Even though I was in a self-deprecating
frame of mind, I was
angry enough at my perceived
place at the bottom of the social
garbage heap to decide to go out
on my own. It did not hurt that
my older son's best friend had
been working in a home furnishings
store for several years and
was close with the store manager.
Personally, even with this "in," I
did not think that I would actually
be hired. I went to the job interview
thinking that I had absolutely
nothing more to lose and,
therefore, I was stunned when the
manager told me that I was hired.


And here is where I feel that
my road to independence diverges
from that of most others with a
major mental illness, for here is
where I first began to fight an all-out
war against my paranoia and
other fearful and/or bizarre ideas,
my feelings of worthlessness, and
my former conviction that I would
always be a highly dependent person.
I waged this war not because
I am so brave but because I absolutely
had to in order to keep my
job. A few mere words cannot
possibly convey to the reader both
the intensity and the persistence of
the pain I underwent in the process
of fighting these inner battles.


It was a good thing that I did
not fully realize this at the time,
or I might not have found the fortitude
to go on with it, for I remind
you again that I am not an
unusually brave person. What
gave me the drive to fight for my
own life was how much I hated
the rigid restrictions of poverty
and other painful aspects of mental
illness and the consequent stigmatization.
I knew I could not
change the collective mind of society,
but I vowed to overcome
the overwhelmingly negative
effects of self-stigmatization, for I
was acutely aware of how terribly
narrow and limited choices can be
when one passively accepts self-stigmatization.

[p. <i>409</i>]

A year later, I wished to return
to college for my degree in psychology.
I reasoned that once
armed with a degree, maybe, just
maybe, I could aim for a better
job and become financially
independent.


But because of inadequate public
transportation in my neighborhood,
I knew that I had to climb one of
the highest mountains in my life.
Namely, I would have to get my
driver's license, and the peak of
this particular mountain was the
formidable and dreaded road test!


While many people find the
road test traumatic, my thinking
and behavior was rather rigid at
the time and, as a new driver, I
experienced a great deal of awkwardness
and disabling anxiety
when trying to handle a car I was
driving for the first time. Thus, although
I had paid extra for the
unquestionable advantage of taking
the road test in the same car in
which I had practiced for it, the
only thing the two cars had in
common was the color red. On
the morning of the big day, I
passed the time by ironing my
children's clothes.


In due time, the driving instructor
showed up in that alien red
car, and I discovered when he
drove us to the secret site of the
road test that I had been awarded
the area of quiet side streets immediately
adjacent to Creedmoor
State Hospital! How fitting, I
thought to myself. As we had arrived
an hour early, I lost count
of how many cigarettes and
Hershey's kisses I consumed in
what seemed like the longest hour
of my life.


Then, sitting on the curb, my
thinking changed. I told myself I
had not gone through all the anxiety,
fear, and pain just to have it
all go for naught by failing my
road test. Well, I pulled myself together
and, not only did I pass
that darn test, but I earned a perfect
score for not making any errors.
However, once again, I did
not know that the war was not
over; no, not by a long shot was
it over. In reality, it was just beginning,
but I was mercifully unaware
of this as my children and
I celebrated my victory.


Enjoying life is not possible if
you do not believe that you even
have a right to exist, let alone
consider improving your self-esteem,
which, in my experience,
is one of most therapists favorite
topics. I have also learned an extremely
important fact. It is imperative
that the patient/client/
consumer be cognizant of the absence
of self-esteem and be able to
express it to his or her therapist
before any meaningful change in
psychological status can occur.


Before my hospitalization, I had
no real understanding of this fact.
I realize only now, in retrospect,
how terrifyingly close I had once
been to committing suicide.


Although this could be a good
place to end this article, in order
to emphasize the main point that
life's battles are never "all over
and done with" (as some mentally
ill individuals tend to believe
can happen), I want to describe
one more aspect of my personal
fight with the fallout from self-stigmatization.
Yes, I passed my
driver's test and my children got
me a car. Well, for a full 6
months after that, I went through
absolute hell—intensive, unmerciful,
and unremitting self-torture. I
found that driving was a nightmarish,
exhausting experience because
I simply could not help
being riddled with extreme anxiety.
I would look for approval of
my driving ability and skill from
the person in the car behind me.
Instead of being a positive source
of information about traffic conditions
immediately behind me, my
sick use of the rearview mirror
was a source of torment.


This may strike you as comical;
even I can laugh at it now. But at
the time I found driving so tiring
that I looked forward to red lights
so that I could stop to get some
rest, and I often wished that those
red lights were longer. Obviously,
most "normal" drivers here on
planet Earth do not enjoy having
to stop for red lights and these
days neither do I.


Yes, it does indeed have a
funny side. But it also has a
deadly serious aspect to it. In
order to write this article, I have
had to look back, and thinking
about all that I have had to endure
because of self-stigmatization
has caused me to relive much of
the pain all over again, albeit in a
relatively minor way. Even the
horrid phenomenon of looking in
the rearview mirror for a sick reason
recurred to a mild degree.
Therein lies the main point I wish
to elucidate: once I win a battle,
especially one that is big and
tough, even though I may have to
go through it all over again, it is
never, but never, nearly as hard to
fight as it was the first time. For
me, this is a major source of satisfaction,
contentment, and a true
sense of self-esteem and overall
well-being. This is so despite the
fact that, before my psychiatric
hospitalization, when I could no
longer withstand the pain of being
alive and I had, in fact, almost
committed suicide, my life now,
without qualification, is definitely
worth living.

[p. <i>410</i>]

Finally, I simply wish to state
that I am alive and well and I
recognize the signs of the need to
push myself forward once again.
However, no one, including myself,
can yet predict in what direction
I may grow, what changes I
may make, and so forth.


Am I scared of what lies ahead?
Yes, but I have learned that it is
well worth confronting fears head-on
and coping with them, for it
means that I am in control of my
own life by making my own decisions
and selecting my own
choices out of the plethora of options
life offers me—indeed, that
life offers all of us, if only we can
open our eyes wide enough to see
them.


In conclusion, after all the struggling
I have done on my road to
independence, I am now accepting
enough of myself, and know and
like myself well enough, to be
able to encounter failure without
its having the catastrophic effect it
once inevitably had on me. I now
understand that failure does not
mean that I am worthless. Rather,
it is an indication that I too am a
human being and, as such, I will
occasionally experience failure
along with the many successes on
the road of my life.
