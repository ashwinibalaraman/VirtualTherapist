BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
THERAPIST: Yes, I had a rough week.
CLIENT: Ah, it is OK. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Um, let's see — as the insurance doctor, I had them put together a bill. [Sighs] I think I — you should have been getting the ODs [regularly on] (ph) your parents', but, um, your medical insurance — you're internally paid; they didn't pay a lot.
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: Um, something between like 50 and 70 bucks, maybe.
CLIENT: Hmm, I wonder why that is the case.
THERAPIST: Um, [we just get buried] (ph). I think I'm remembering — I mean, I'll look at it, and I'll write you up and tell you a bill, but I think they had a really low allowed rate for psychotherapy...
CLIENT: Oh.
THERAPIST: ...Like 80 bucks or something.
CLIENT: Oh. [00:00:57]
THERAPIST: So we're — I'm making this up now [at 855] (ph), let's say, so, um, we'll have a ton to make up, like between the recording and that. But it might be between 40 and 50 a session, but I'll double-check. Um, and then, certainly, you are still a — in pretty good shape in the sense that you had paid for sessions that I think insurance helped to cover so...
CLIENT: OK.
THERAPIST: But I'll put it all together for you.
CLIENT: Cool, cool. So [sighs] [chuckles], um, I'm really tired. [Chuckles] I...
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: ...Didn't sleep last night, so I don't know that I'll be...
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: ...Particularly coherent today. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh?
CLIENT: But I got some fairly good news today. Um, I was accepted in off the wait list from the Colony. [00:02:01]
THERAPIST: Oh, congratulations.
CLIENT: Yeah [exhales], thank you.
THERAPIST: Good for you.
CLIENT: So that was cool. Um, the only problem with that is that they have grant money, which they allocate on a sliding scale to the people they let in at first, and they don't leave grant money for [chuckles] the others.
THERAPIST: Oh.
CLIENT: But, unlike some of the other more questionable writers' colonies, they charge you, um, like $600 to stay in a single room for 25 days, which is like about what I pay for rent and utilities. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So I won't be losing any money; I'll just...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: So, I mean, it is — but I definitely said "yes."
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: It won't be putting me behind [chuckles] in any ways, and I'm, you know, really excited about it.
THERAPIST: So when will you go?
CLIENT: Um, starts — it is June 5 through July 1 of — soon! [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Wow, yes, it is. [00:02:59]
CLIENT: Um, I didn't have high hopes for getting in off the wait list, too. It seems like, you know, people who apply do probably want to go, but I guess it might be difficult with - but for people [who've kids] (ph), different things — because I know overnight visitors — I mean, I don't know, who knows why, but [slaps surface], but for whatever reason, I get to go. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Right. Uh-huh, well, that's great. Where is it?
CLIENT: It is in Tybee.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so, uh, I guess I'll still have to figure out some way to maybe get on some of the Internet with it and try to make some money while I'm there.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But just being in a new place where different people are trying to do art and sharing ideas, like, is so exciting. I hope it will be sort of like being back in [inaudible] (ph) but maybe less angst-y. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: So I think I'll be, based on my understanding, one of the younger people. Not the — like, [in many ways] (ph), they try to vary the ages, but, um, it is not like, you know, a twenties convention. [Chuckles] [00:04:08]
THERAPIST: Right, right.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: Aw, that's exciting.
CLIENT: Yeah, yeah. That was a really nice — like, there just is not that many good things that've been happening lately [chuckles], so...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...It is nice for something to work out.
THERAPIST: Yeah, absolutely.
CLIENT: Um, so — so that's good. Um — uh, I've been spending most of my time trying to finish up the freelance stuff, which, like many things I do, often instead of closing gaps, you know, balloons out into [slaps surface] details, and [do some] (ph) headings, and new crucial details that need to be included. Um, and I'm a bit worried, but my employers are not going to want the level of detail and care that I [chuckles] have put in. [00:05:08]
THERAPIST: I see. Yeah. [Clears throat]
CLIENT: Um, I just e-mailed them on Monday, sort of sheepishly explaining my neurotic process, and I haven't heard back yet, so I hope it is going to be OK because I — I don't know that I went about things in exactly the they wanted, but the instructions they gave me were so vague, and the materials that they gave me to work with were so inadequate..
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But I either had to choose between giving them something sort of shoddy and the reasonable thing, which would have been to communicate with them about creating something better, or just decide on my own what was better and do that.
THERAPIST: Right, which is what you did.
CLIENT: Which is — yeah, which is always what I do, unfortunately.
THERAPIST: Uh-huh.
CLIENT: Like, it is very unprofessional. Well, I guess when I was working, I sort of had to — being in the media forces you to communicate more with the people around you. But given a little freedom, and I hole up in my room and go all John Nash, [chuckles]... [00:06:10]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...Until everything kind of comes [chuckles], and, you know, figure out the — the perfect conspiracy.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, so [pauses] it sort of — I — I really need to try to finish it today. I've been putting in a lot of hours and the — the dextroamphetamine is definitely helping me focus.
THERAPIST: Good.
CLIENT: And I think, if I had been able to get on it earlier, I wouldn't have fallen so behind in the first place.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Coughs]
CLIENT: Um, but it is really feeling like, even being behind and doing things that I know probably aren't exactly what my employer would ideally have me doing [chuckles], I...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...I mean, at least it is going steadily, and I can sort of predict a certain minimum amount of progress... [00:07:02]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...That will be made in an hour. As long — it always seems to be, on a given day of work, like an hour or two, and I just get really upset [chuckles] about the future and what's going to happen, and, um, become sort of incapacitated. But, generally, I manage to snap myself out of it and work more [chuckles] after whenever that happens.
THERAPIST: Mm. Well [chuckles]...
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: ...[What was I shaking for there] (ph)?
CLIENT: I don't know. I don't know. I just [sighs] definitely don't — don't feel like I'm acting my age. [Chuckles] Um...
THERAPIST: What do you mean? [00:07:57]
CLIENT: Mm, taking a job that I don't care about that much — this freelance thing. I'm in some way turning it into not like how best can I pay my rent, but how best can I create a superlative document about actively writing in every discipline (ph). [Chuckles] Like, I kind of wanted this to be an exercise in not doing that, not an exercise in doing that more effectively. [Chuckles] It was supposed to be sort of a transitional ritual into, you know, approaching things rationally again, but I'm sort of just doing my usual — I don't do my usual tricks, but — but, uh, more functional...
THERAPIST: Like productively? Yeah.
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] [00:08:58]
[Silence for 16 seconds]
CLIENT: Um, and there are definite places where I notice a lot of improvement — like, say on the sentence level, I'm much more willing to write about [chuckles] some, leave it for a while, and come back to it later. Um, there is less of this — well, there's still perfectionism, but it is healthier than it was when I was just so blocked.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: It is not, uh, as anxious and as compulsive, and as, um — uh, preoccupying?
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] [00:09:52]
CLIENT: Yeah, and then some of the strange things are still there. Like, I still have a really hard time getting to the work. Like, sometimes, I still sit down and look at the document, and find myself sort of unable to read it, and the words just don't translate into meanings or connect; it is like looking at a picture made of letters. And, sometimes, it takes me a while still to get beyond that, like connect myself to the document and start producing meanings normally again. Um, and once I get into the zone, as long as I don't get up to eat or talk to anyone; I generally stay in it. But, sometimes, if I get up and, like, make myself a microwave dinner, sometimes I get out of it and then have to re-orient myself, um, which is sort of frustrating. It is like, "What about cooking a microwave dinner that changes the way this document reads?" [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pauses] Hmm. [00:10:58]
[Silence for 7 seconds]
CLIENT: Um, and so I can choose to be encouraged by what happens when I don't get up to do anything or talk to anyone. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: But it is always still sort of frustrating that there's that time lost every time I do anything else. Um, I mean, if I take a break to write other things, you know, that I can get right back to it, and it is fine. But that seems to be — or, sometimes, even if I take a break to read something, as long as it is not like [in and up logs] (ph)...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: If it is, um...
THERAPIST: Like more like [inaudible at 00:11:51]? Yeah.
CLIENT: [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Then that doesn't totally break my focus. But [pauses] it seems like anything that, uh, sort of brings me in contact with the outside world is threatening to my focus. [00:12:10]
THERAPIST: Is it, uh [pauses] — I wonder if it — if that's because it is just threatening, period, in some fashion.
CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I think I generally get sort of frazzled by — well, you know, in the past couple of years, by social interactions and sort of navigating the world.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, but I think, generally — not so much like here but before here, I hid that pretty decently. Um, there would be a sense in which I felt I was always sort of — almost in my, like, my emotional high register, like in the way in which people started speaking in high voices when they're nervous, except I was, like, feeling in high — I mean, you think of high spirits as happiness, but there was a sense in which it was sort of tiny (ph) and cramped, like the way I felt. [00:13:22]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds, um — I'm not saying this is what it was, but like a little hypermanic or — which can have that feeling of being sort of brittle and a little agitated and — but still kind of energized and up, and anxious in a way?
CLIENT: Yeah, that sounds right.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, and I just feel like I'm not sort of inhabiting my whole self within - sort of, like, stuck in my head and maybe like my shoulders, and — and, um, [pauses] it is strange. Like, in [<i>Here There</i>] (ph), they always talk about your solar plexus as this important emotional center, some sense of self... [00:14:14]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And, sometimes, I feel like, when I'm by myself, my solar plexus is much more connected to my sense of self and existence, um, and then, socially, I lose contact with it.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I think that groundedness has something to do with my ability to focus on writing.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: If I follow, it is prerequisite for being able to write in a reasonable way? [00:14:51]
CLIENT: Yeah. And, I think, sometimes, with journaling or whatever, like, I can be really frazzled and start writing just neurotic ramblings, and maybe get to a calmer place, eventually, or sometimes not. [Chuckles] Um, but when I try to do the textbook writing, which is — I mean, there was one particular time when it sort of felt like my head was full of rebellious teenagers, and I said, "OK, guys, get out. I want to invite the textbook over for tea." And they were like, "No, we want to talk and play our music, and have the TV on all at the same time."
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Like, "He can't come over." [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, and [pauses] it [chuckles] is frustrating. [Pauses] Um, [pauses] and it would be nice if social interaction didn't just sort of, uh, make me lose my equilibrium like that. [00:16:03]
[Silence for 25 seconds]
THERAPIST: My impression is that you have to [pauses] often, like, [tense up] (ph) pretty heavily during social interaction, and [pauses] sometimes, like pretty judiciously. Um, [pauses] in a way, I could imagine maybe part of it [pauses]... [00:17:07]
CLIENT: Yeah, I guess there is a certain controlling impulse that could be sort of stifling when it, um, doesn't have the social sphere to control but still has sort of got its claws out.
THERAPIST: It is — sorry, I missed something. Say that again.
CLIENT: Like, once the sort of controlling censoring tendency comes out...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm?
CLIENT: ...And decides to exercise its power, I think it is — overstays its welcome.
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: And then, when I go back into my room and close the door, and get back to writing the textbook...
THERAPIST: I see. [00:17:57]
CLIENT: ...Like, it is sort of still there. It is going to shut me off from anything outside of myself. [Pauses for 18 seconds] Because there's a certain amount of vigilance and nervousness, and chatter that just practically can't go on [chuckles] when I'm writing a textbook.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And, um, those things are very eager to keep going on all the time.
THERAPIST: Right.
[Silence for 25 seconds]
[00:19:00]
CLIENT: And it is almost strange that they don't see fiction as so much of a threat. I mean, fiction is a much more responsive form, and I can [chuckles] write whatever I feel like writing. And what — however I'm feeling can affect what happens in the narrative that day. Um, and, I mean, you know, my feelings definitely affect the textbook writing, too. Like, some days, I'll be more snarky, and other days, I'll be more straightforward. [Chuckles] Um, and I can kind of tell what mood I was in when I wrote the section... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: ...To a degree that I have to sort of streamline a little bit, um, and make sure it is not uneven. But, um, [pauses] I mean, I know how much that I have to do with the form of fiction itself and how much [shit it is] (ph), just that that's something that isn't connected to anyone else at this point; it is purely my project. [00:20:20]
[Silence for 20 seconds]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [Clears throat] [00:20:40]
CLIENT: I guess it also seems like an easier, uh, way for truth to appear, because, um, like in my fiction, in addition to the main novel I'm working on — I'm working on a dystopian novel. You know, I'm spending less time on it but working out some ideas here and there — and, um, you know, I really do let my characters be pretty cruel to each other, and it seems sort of realistic to me, and in a way that I can express things about the world that I have trouble expressing in a social context. Um, and the world of my fiction looks much more like the world I sort of suspect is the real world than the world I pretend I live in when I'm around people. Um, [pauses] and the textbook is written...
THERAPIST: I'm not entirely clear on the differences there.
CLIENT: Um...
THERAPIST: ...Between people of the world as you expect it to be and the world that you tell yourself you live in? [Coughs] [00:22:00]
CLIENT: I don't know that I tell myself I live in it as much as I...
THERAPIST: Oh, OK.
CLIENT: ...Act as though I live in it so that — just if you're here to relate to others. Um — I mean, in fiction, like, bad things can and do happen. There's something very satisfying about writing about a dystopian future, um, in which certain tendencies that may be somewhat more latent or intermittent in our society have really come out and become part of the governmental structure.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, [pauses]...
THERAPIST: Like zombies. [Chuckles]
CLIENT: [Chuckles] Oh... [chuckles]
THERAPIST: [Chuckles]
CLIENT: Um, one thing I've been working on is the — the ministry of propaganda, which rounded up the most prominent Ph.Ds. in the arts and has been sort of — really go at it trying to juggle for power and prove that their art form is really the most powerful, best way to manipulate people. And it is just fun... [chuckles] [00:23:12]
THERAPIST: Oh, really?
CLIENT: ...Um, conceiving of their characters and their rationales, and the clinical trials they do with people, which get increasingly, more and more sadistic to test the effective art. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: I see.
CLIENT: Um, and, [just similarly] (ph), you think fiction to sort of take these sort of sinister and manipulative [kind of seasoned] (ph) popular culture, um, to a more extreme manifestation...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Is still sort of more [chuckles] natural to me than, um, participating in the culture of trying to be happy.
[Silence for 10 seconds]
[00:24:00]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: Um, I had a sort of — I had mixed feelings about the Group on Monday night.
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: Um, as I mentioned, I had gone into detail, which was forbidden, a couple of meetings ago. [Slaps surface]
THERAPIST: Yes.
CLIENT: Um, and Monday night's session was about memory and how memories of trauma manifest in present — in the present day. And one of the leaders said, "I know, even though we're talking about memory, like, make sure you don't go into details," and looked at me specifically. [Chuckles] And just felt like, you know, to hide under my chair. [Chuckles]
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: And I didn't — you know, it probably wasn't intentional, or maybe it was but maybe it was supposed to be really subtle; I don't know. [Chuckles] Or maybe I'm overblowing it 'cause people tend to do that with things relating to themselves. But who knows? [Chuckles] [00:25:01]
THERAPIST: Yeah, [chuckles] [maybe the gentleman wasn't very nice] (ph).
CLIENT: Maybe. Um, but [pauses] I was sort of trying to gauge, um — I don't know if I mentioned that the last sess — like, the session after the one where I revealed details, like, they said, "Oh, last week's talk got, like, really heavy and serious, and emotional, and we thought we'd, um, create like a lighter discussion for this time," and, um, so I felt the need to really sort of tone it down or be more positive that time. And then, this time, I wondered whether it was sort of like the pendulum had swung in both directions, and now it was neutral space.
THERAPIST: Hmm. [00:25:54]
CLIENT: And I was trying to see if, you know, what — what people were going for and, um, [pauses] it seems like a certain degree of positivity was wanted. I'll probably just say exactly, like, why I thought that; although, I don't think I was wrong about it. You know, it wasn't said explicitly or anything. Um, and I think, you know, we opened the group by doing sort of a mindfulness grounding technique, which is, you know, something the group often does, which is nice. Um, and then, at the end, we go around the room saying techniques that sort of worked for us when memories were coming back, at a time when we really couldn't afford to deal with them.
THERAPIST: Right. [00:26:54]
CLIENT: And I don't know whether it is because, like, I've been so unsuccessful with finding techniques to help with that or what, but, um, it felt sort of constrained; that meaning not someone to be talking detail or anything, but I think, uh, I may have a more sort of negative attitude, both about the world and about sort of my future in dealing with this successfully, in a way, than some of the other people in the group.
THERAPIST: Um, [pauses] hmm... [00:27:50]
CLIENT: There's one girl who seems to be like even more negative, but she never says anything. Then there's one girl who is hard to get a read because, you know, she sort of goes back and forth between seeming to have a negative attitude and positive attitude about revealing what she is relating to all of us. Um, [pauses] [sighs] but I feel like I'm sort of in a — an odd position, being one of the people who's really open to talking but also sort of feeling bitter and negative about, um, like really incorporating the trauma back in so it is not interfering with my life. And — I don't know — I sort of have to...
THERAPIST: Like, that you can — happening in a way that is working for you? [00:28:52]
CLIENT: Um, [exhales] [pauses] I guess, um, no — when I think about certain basic conditions like being able to write and feeling confident, um, that I can do academic work, and confident enough to actually contact Brown and see if there's any chance of coming back, and also just like — even like wanting to socialize normally - those are all things that are important to me, that, um — I mean, hopefully, [slaps surface] when I finish this part of the freelance project, which is going to happen today or tomorrow, I think — and that's actually realistic — usually, I'm not realistic, but...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...Having worked steadily, I think it is realistic.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm. [00:29:52]
CLIENT: So some of these things are going to — something is going to happen soon with some of them. [Chuckles] But, um, [sighs] I think a lot of people felt pressured to have a narrative for, "Things are doing badly now, but I think, you know, I'll probably do better in the future," or something.
[Silence for 7 seconds]
THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like you're not so sure, or maybe you don't think it is going to be like that.
CLIENT: Um, it is not like I was like I totally ruled it out, but I think I'm just really bitter about having spent so many hours trying to fix certain things that trauma was messing up, specifically like the writing for school. Like — um, I think it is just hard for me having spent so many hours trying to do that and failing to be that optimistic, in a way, even if I think it will get better at some point. [00:31:10]
THERAPIST: Are you talking about hours, like, on your own, hours in here?
CLIENT: Mostly the hours on my own. Um, I think the amount of hours I spent trying to write and failing is staggering, and it was really bad for me psychologically. Um, it was just so demoralizing. And I think it is really just bad for you to spend, like, eight hours a day miserably failing at something, [chuckles] and it sort of leaves a mark. Um...
THERAPIST: [Clears throat] Mm.
[Silence for 12 seconds]
[00:32:00]
CLIENT: So it is strange in the meetings because I think, when I feel sort of bitter and negative, it is not like — I mean, it is sort of like an active, like authentic [chuckles] — but it is. It is not sort of like a passive-aggressive or half-repressed bitterness, which I think can be sort of weird and insidious, um, like strange because it is clearly not very well dealt with or digested, and it comes out in strange ways.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But [slaps surface] I don't know — I mean, personally, I sort of think if you own your bitterness, it is not such a negative force that spreads to others, maybe. But I just don't know if the group leader thinks that, so I feel the need to, uh, skew to the positive and maybe say half of - you know, certain common [text phrases] (ph) that come to mind. [00:33:11]
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: Um, and I think...
THERAPIST: Do you feel any of that here?
CLIENT: Mm, not here.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm, like that it is not OK to express whatever bitterment — bitterness you might feel or want to express?
CLIENT: I think there are times when I just don't want to hear it from myself, [chuckles] um, because it seems like — seems inconvenient or tiring to articulate those thoughts and feelings.
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: But, um... [00:33:57]
THERAPIST: Do you feel [pauses] um — yeah, I guess it sounds like you felt so stunted by this. Um, [pauses] so did the — so much at a loss for what to do, I guess, mostly like you said, when it comes to gaining confidence that you'll be able to write academically or, um, be social more comfortably, or get back to school. [00:35:00]
CLIENT: Yeah. It was just like spending so many hundreds of hours focusing on these specific things and being rebuffed by them so thoroughly, without encouragement, um, just really makes it hard to be that hopeful, I guess. Even if, maybe on an intellectual level, I think things have improved, um, it is just hard to put myself into that situation. Even — I mean, finding out about the effect of Wellbutrin definitely changed my attitude about, like...
THERAPIST: Right.
CLIENT: ...Going back into stressful situations. But I think there is still just a very basic — I mean, almost, it is just like animalistic level like fear, um — habitual fear that I gained from just, you know, subjecting myself to that much torture. Um, that seems kind of hard to come out. [00:36:15]
THERAPIST: I [get that in my mind] (ph) the sort of fear that makes somebody reflexively inhibited.
CLIENT: Yeah.
[Silence for 9 seconds]
THERAPIST: Like, this is going to be corny, but it is very — excuse me, but like — you know, like your hand is burnt so many times, and then you turn around, and the world is full of stoves or something. [00:36:51]
CLIENT: Yeah. [Chuckles] Yeah, that's [the feeling] (ph). Um, [pauses] and I guess maybe, in the meetings, when I sort of reveal details about meaning to - uh, I think I might have thought that maybe there was a social space in which you could be bitter and negative without it being perceived as negative in the sense of getting other people down, but — but it — but then I may have been wrong about that. [Chuckles] Um...
THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess we're talking about another experience of being burned in a way, and one in which I imagine you felt [sighs] in the end, kind of set up. I mean, I think it is pretty expectable that bitterness and pessimism often go along with trauma, and that you were being invited to react genuinely about things you felt, and then kind of scolded, and, um, [pauses] and sort of also given the message that you were not doing the right thing... [00:38:43]
CLIENT: Yeah.
THERAPIST: ...When you did [pauses] try to put yourself out there.
CLIENT: Yeah. Yeah, and there was some disappointment in the situation, and also some in myself for managing to sort of... [00:39:07]
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...It was almost like I sort of ruined things for myself and the other more negative girls by doing that, um, and creating a situation in which the group leaders felt like they needed to make things lighter and more positive. [Chuckles] Like, if only I could have somehow gauged it right, [chuckles] maybe I could still have this space where I could, um, be bitter and have that big sign...
THERAPIST: [Clears throat]
CLIENT: ...And not having people thinking I should be more positive, or that they should be depressed because of my attitude. You know? [Chuckles] [Sounds emotional, about to cry] [00:39:48]
THERAPIST: Yeah. [Pauses for 28 seconds] Yeah, um, [pauses for 17 seconds], yeah, I guess I'm just thinking about the way it seems to me, but perhaps [pauses for 8 seconds] [sirens sound outside] what happened is reminding me of what you worried about last spring, with your writing, where you were [pauses], I think, worried about being misread or read in a way you didn't want or mean to be read, that was sort of pejorative and hurtful. It — it — I guess I'm reminded of that by this. [00:41:38]
CLIENT: Yeah. [pauses] Yeah, and in this situation, it is a — a dynamic social situation. I mean, you can sort of look at the expressions of people around you...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
CLIENT: ...And their reactions, and the way in which the group leaders are steering the conversation.
THERAPIST: Yeah. [00:41:57]
CLIENT: Um, I remember in an earlier meeting, like, you know [avoid things, frustrations] (ph) was the tendency of society to want to bring you quickly to a positive place...
THERAPIST: Mm-hmm.
CLIENT: ...And that really was moving with a lot of people around the room...
THERAPIST: Yeah.
