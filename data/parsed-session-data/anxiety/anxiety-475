BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
<b>DR:</b> So it's quick this time.
<b>PT:</b> What do you mean?
<b>DR:</b> I feel like I've seen you recently.
<b>PT:</b> About 3 months.
<b>DR:</b> But we spoke?
<b>PT:</b> We spoke yes, about a month ago.
<b>DR:</b> You went back up?
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> How did the summer go?
<b>PT:</b> The summer was great.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, no complaints, fun, restful, it was good.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, June 26th that's when, all right.  Yeah, you're right, 3 months.  All right, back then your mood was good, you were not sad, anxious, or irritable.  Your appetite was good, you were sleeping fine, you were not suicidal.  Your energy was good, you were exercising, you were working, sex was fine, some reduction in your libido every 2 or 3 weeks.  All right, so you were in a good place.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And so, from that good place, you're doing so well, let's get rid of the Lexapro and maintain the Wellbutrin.
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> And so we, I don't think we just stopped, we may have tapered, whatever, but soon thereafter you called me.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, about 2 months later.
<b>DR:</b> Two months after being on 0 or 2 months after being on 5?
<b>PT:</b> About 3 weeks after being on 0 I called you.
<b>DR:</b> Okay.
<b>PT:</b> I went down to 5, I guess I was on 5 for 4 or 5 weeks because I think you told me go a month.
<b>DR:</b> And those weeks were okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, totally rock solid okay.
<b>DR:</b> And then when you went to 0 what happened, what changed?
<b>PT:</b> Well, from my perspective, I didn't think there really was any change.  My girlfriend claimed I was irritable, a little short with her, and just not myself.
<b>DR:</b> But you didn't agree.
<b>PT:</b> No wholly but I didn't feel right, I don't know, maybe we were just going through a bad time.
<b>DR:</b> Was she doing something to make you mad?
<b>PT:</b> Who she?  No, no.
<b>DR:</b> She was normal, she hasn't changed?
<b>PT:</b> She has her ups and downs but, yeah, by in large, she hasn't changed.  She got pissed at me because after we met last I spoke to her about what we spoke about, about me cutting back and even possibly going to 0, she got very upset because her sister is not, she's got issues and her sister at some point stopped whatever meds she's on, she lives in California and it f'd her up and she was never able to really get back to where she was, so [NAME OTHER] my girlfriend, kept envisioning that would happen to me.
<b>DR:</b> She doesn't know you off meds, right?
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> She met you after you were on meds.
<b>PT:</b> Yes.
<b>DR:</b> She must think there's some monster lurking that she never met and she doesn't want to meet.
<b>PT:</b> Perhaps.
<b>DR:</b> So she's got her own agenda or - 
<b>PT:</b> It's justifiable, I think.
<b>DR:</b> Maybe but it's not fair for you to have to live with her demons, we've got to take care of you.  So she was extra sensitive when you went off it.
<b>PT:</b> Yes, when I was going to go off it.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> And then we talked about it and I just didn't want to argue with her and I said fine, I won't do it, then I went ahead and did it anyway.
<b>DR:</b> Without telling her.
<b>PT:</b> Correct, I went to 5 and then we were away on vacation down in the virgin Islands and we were talking and somehow it came up and I said to her, I said so, how have I been, have you noticed anything different about me in the last month or so and she said no.  And I told her that I was on half, she flipped out, I lied to her, how could she trust me, I was deceitful, everything.  She didn't talk to me the whole flight home.
<b>DR:</b> Oh really.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I just said, you know, obviously, she was overreacting and I was trying to do it so that she wouldn't think that if we had any episodes that it was the medication.
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> She didn't see any difference in me when I was on 5.  So we talked it all out and then I told her I would try 0.  She wasn't crazy about it once she knew and she was sort of sabotaging me a little bit in anything.  She goes, oh you know, I don't think you're right and then - 
<b>DR:</b> And did you notice anything?
<b>PT:</b> Huh-uh.
<b>DR:</b> But given her concerns, you called me and we decided let's go back on to 5.
<b>PT:</b> I'm back to 10, I'm back to 10.
<b>DR:</b> Well, obviously, next time we do this, we're not telling her.
<b>PT:</b> I'm done with that.
<b>DR:</b> Because it's, I mean it's a busted experiment, there's too much noise in the experiment for us to know what happened but it's okay.
<b>PT:</b> But interestingly, I didn't experience any change in the libido.
<b>DR:</b> So your sex drive didn't last, your ejaculatory function didn't change.  You didn't come premature ejaculation?
<b>PT:</b> Nothing like that, I just had problems and nothing happened when I went to 5, nothing happened when I went to 0.
<b>DR:</b> So the good news is you're essentially without side effects from the medicine.  Except for theoretical issues, there's no real reason to stop it.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> How's your mood?
<b>PT:</b> Pretty good.
<b>DR:</b> Good.  Most of the time you're not sad, you're not anxious, you're not irritable?
<b>PT:</b> I've been a little anxious, not irritable but a little anxious over the last couple of weeks, you know, school just started back so it's transition time but I sense a little anxiousness in me.
<b>DR:</b> You know, it was that way a little bit in the beginning.
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> You're almost like you're on, right?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're up there being judged at every moment, that's not easy.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I've got to get back into the groove, obviously, make new bonds.  I don't know if you recall but, you know, the classes that I had last year I was very fond of, I'm going to miss them, some really good kids I liked and so it's always a new group and I don't have the same bonds and we struggle with this, so it's a transition period that I trust will pass.
<b>DR:</b> Does it seem like a good group?
<b>PT:</b> They do, they seem, they're well behaved.
<b>DR:</b> It's not just 1 group is it?
<b>PT:</b> No, when I say group, I've got 116 students a day.  I've got 1 idiot but that's fine, I only have 1.
<b>DR:</b> Oh, now is where you have to assert authority with all the classes, right?
<b>PT:</b> Absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> Piss in the corner, you know
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.
<b>DR:</b> Your nose in it.
<b>PT:</b> And so far, I'm not 
<b>DR:</b> You have the alpha males probably trying to assert themselves in the classroom too.
<b>PT:</b> But not as much in the past and I don't know whether it's because I'm being tough on them and I'm just squeezing them so hard nobody is budging.  I'm not seeing any personalities.
<b>DR:</b> You're probably better at picking it up fast rather than giving it room to grow, you know, when you see someone trying to test the limits
<b>PT:</b> Oh, I cut it off immediately
<b>DR:</b> And that's just experience
<b>PT:</b> Right.
<b>DR:</b> Right, you just know where it's going.
<b>PT:</b> I think to an extent my reputation probably precedes me that I don't tolerate any nonsense.
<b>DR:</b> How many students in each class?
<b>PT:</b> I've my largest classes this year.  I've got 3 classes with 26 kids and I don't know how but 1 of them I've got 16 kids.  The average is usually 22 but this year they're a little higher.
<b>DR:</b> Is that rougher?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, it's more difficult, it's more crowded, there's less I can do in terms of 1 on 1 kind of instruction which I value, you know, as much as parents want it for their kids.
<b>DR:</b> It makes it more interesting for you too.
<b>PT:</b> Sure.
<b>DR:</b> You know, you have to kind of know that they're with you rather than just dumping information on them.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Do you call on kids a lot?
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> That's how you keep them on their toes.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, call on them, I like for them to get up in front of the group and have to demonstrate things, with a larger group it sucks to get them all up there regularly.
<b>DR:</b> And are you teaching much of the same things through the day?
<b>PT:</b> This year it's all the same.
<b>DR:</b> All the same.
<b>PT:</b> The same, yeah
<b>DR:</b> So every group, wow.
<b>PT:</b> My last period.
<b>DR:</b> You've got to be something to make it
<b>PT:</b> The last period of the day, they're a little lower, I have a special ed teacher in the room with me
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> So it's just a couple of kids, so it's a slower paced class, [INAUDIBLE] a little bit but for the most part it's the same show and [INAUDIBLE] as the day goes so that's why I like the kids to have some of their own character personality to make it a little different for me.  
<b>DR:</b> Right.
<b>PT:</b> We cover the same material but we get at it in a different way.
<b>DR:</b> If that doesn't vary, it allows the other things to become more interesting and kind of know when the class should be able to get this because you've done it 3 other times during the day.
<b>PT:</b> Like today, I had a lesson the first few periods and it didn't go well.  I had prepared something and I knew it's not going, by third period I readjusted a little bit.
<b>DR:</b> Exactly.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, do the same stuff, you've got the material to cover it, but it was more interesting to me having [INAUDIBLE], you do what you've got to do.
<b>DR:</b> And the extracurricular stuff.
<b>PT:</b> I've [INAUDIBLE] lined up this year as of yet which I'm actually enjoying, you know, after school I can kind of
<b>DR:</b> What time does school end?
<b>PT:</b> Officially we're out at 2:30, we're not supposed to leave the building till 3 but [INAUDIBLE] is nice.  I'll go to afternoon golf, the gym earlier, I get home earlier, so it's nice.
<b>DR:</b> And the reffing?
<b>PT:</b> That won't kick up till mid November.
<b>DR:</b> And you're looking forward to a good season?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How's your appetite?  Hold on, back up a little bit.  You said you were anxious, anything besides the new kids going on in your life?  Girlfriend is okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, well she brings some shit at me, marriage she's starting to talk about and I said [NAME OTHER], when we started dating, you were clear, you told me you'll never get married again and you can't have kids, you said is that okay and I said absolutely.
<b>DR:</b> But that was then.
<b>PT:</b> Exactly, that's exactly what she said.  She still can't have kids, although she professes to say that.
<b>DR:</b> How old is she?
<b>PT:</b> She's 50.  She can't have kids, but she'd love to have my son.  That's not going to happen.  She still has her son in 9th grade so nothing dramatic can happen till he's out of high school.
<b>DR:</b> He's in your school?
<b>PT:</b> No, he's out now.
<b>DR:</b> Oh.
<b>PT:</b> He's in high school, I'm 8th grade, middle school.  She talks about it.  She talks about buying a property together now and I'm just putting the brakes on.
<b>DR:</b> Wow.  Although we have to wonder where you see your life, as we have wondered for all these years, right?
<b>PT:</b> I'm in a happy place right now.  You know, if she said she wanted to move in with me, I'd say let's give it a shot.
<b>DR:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I would.
<b>DR:</b> And so she may be saying she's not moving in so fast without marrying you.
<b>PT:</b> Well, again, she's in a house, she's got the kids, he son's in 9th grade so, you know, she's trying to forecast in 4 years where once they're both in college, she can downsize and then we can figure out what we're going to do for us, right now it's still about the kids.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> What do you mean?
<b>DR:</b> You know, she doesn't have the options at her age to say marry me or else, you know.
<b>PT:</b> She can say it but she's not going to corner me or, you know, like my cousin said well what would you do if she said F you I'm out of here and I said well then she'd leave.  I'm not going to marry her to keep her in my life, like I'm comfortable with what we have.
<b>DR:</b> But that's the issue she's testing.  She's testing to what extent, what does this attachment mean to you and I think by your answer you're saying not enough, not enough for that, not enough to marry you.  That's not going to go over well on her end of the conversation.
<b>PT:</b> No, it hasn't gone over well in her little coffee club.  I know but I'm kind of tired.  I'm happy with the way things are.  I'm actually, I'm not out looking, I don't give a shit, I'm happy with you and I'm happy to be with my friends or go home and do nothing.  I'm not living some double life.  I told you about the episode with the emails with a friend and she saw, so she has a couple of episodes where like if we're watching a movie or show and there's some kind of romantic chat that's part of the plot, she gets, she gets, well yeah, she loses it.  She can't let go, she can't let go.  She's still convinced these women I work with at school are all after me and she's jealous, she gets jealous easily and that's tough.
<b>DR:</b> It doesn't seem to be getting better either.
<b>PT:</b> It's not getting any worse but it's - 
<b>DR:</b> All right, we'll see where it goes.  Listen, as long as you don't marry her, you've got room.
<b>PT:</b> Well you would be invited so you'd know if it was happening and could stop it, you could object. 
<b>DR:</b> Is there anyone here, yes.  Too high maintenance.  I won't allow it, I won't allow it.
<b>PT:</b> There's got a movie somewhere where the shrink stands up and objects, doesn't allow it.
<b>DR:</b> All right, so you're not sad, you were irritable off the Lexapro and now you're not.
<b>PT:</b> I guess that's a fair statement.
<b>DR:</b> And the anxiety we understand, that's kind of beginning of school stuff.  Appetite is pretty normal.
<b>PT:</b> Uh-huh.
<b>DR:</b> You're sleeping okay?
<b>PT:</b> Yep.
<b>DR:</b> No suicidal thinking?
<b>PT:</b> None.
<b>DR:</b> Feel helpless or hopeless?
<b>PT:</b> No.  I've lost a few pounds if that's worthy of anything.
<b>DR:</b> How many?
<b>PT:</b> Four.
<b>DR:</b> Was that off the Lexapro?
<b>PT:</b> No, no, it was over the last month, consciously, I mean it's not like it just happened.
<b>DR:</b> Been eating less or exercising?
<b>PT:</b> I've been eating dinners earlier.  Over the summer I think we intend to eat later, 7:30-8 and then you're not [INAUDIBLE] and trying to eating nothing after 7 o'clock at night.
<b>DR:</b> Do you eat with her most nights?
<b>PT:</b> Over the summer yes, now no.
<b>DR:</b> So what was that routine, would you be there?
<b>PT:</b> I spent a lot of time at her house over the summer.
<b>DR:</b> And where were her kids?
<b>PT:</b> Her kids were, per their divorce agreement, primarily with the father.
<b>DR:</b> Oh good.
<b>PT:</b> Except for 1 or 2 nights a week and now that's school is back -
<b>DR:</b> That's not uncomfortable with the one who was in your class?
<b>PT:</b> No, she's older now, she's 16, she's mature, she's [INAUDIBLE].   I've got more issues with the boy who wasn't in my class.
<b>DR:</b> What are the issues with him?
<b>PT:</b> He's his father.  He's an arrogant little kid who thinks he's entitled, you know, wants everything done and handed.
<b>DR:</b> And she doesn't set limits with him?
<b>PT:</b> Oh she does and he tries to resist and [INAUDIBLE] their daddy because - 
<b>DR:</b> Daddy will [INAUDIBLE].
<b>PT:</b> Exactly.  There's even talk of the boys staying with the dad all the time but that just wasn't going to happen.
<b>DR:</b> Why not?
<b>PT:</b> Because dad, I don't think, wants it.
<b>DR:</b> Dad didn't want it, yeah, and mom wouldn't let them go.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> But if they were pushing on her, she'd probably.  It would be better for her relationship with you.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah but she's also now, I've never spent the night at her house when the kids are there, I just never thought it was appropriate.  Now that none of the kids are in my school and they're older and we've traveled together, you know, she sort of hinted to me that perhaps it's okay now and I'm still not - 
<b>DR:</b> But she can't spend it at your place because her kids are there.
<b>PT:</b> Correct.
<b>DR:</b> But she - 
<b>PT:</b> Friday nights she can because he's having every Friday night and every other Saturday so that's when she's over my place.  Well in the summer, you know, she got used to having me around, so when the Fall came she goes, you know, this is kind of nice having you here, you know, my kids can handle it.  I said no they can't, I don't want to be put in that position.  Her daughter would have been okay with it but she did talk to her son about it.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> I think so.
<b>DR:</b> Are you okay with it then?   Like to spend most nights over?
<b>PT:</b> Not most, I still like my own time.  I don't want to wake up with them in the house and, you know, do the morning with them, the kids, but just to be with her, yeah, it's good.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> So your idea on that would be for her to move in with you, that's not really
<b>PT:</b> It's not realistic.
<b>DR:</b> Realistic but where you are with the relationship is that it's time to move in not to marry?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> You're definitely not even close to marrying if you don't feel comfortable sleeping over.
<b>PT:</b> Well with the kids in the house, that's what - 
<b>DR:</b> If you marry her, you're going to be living in a house with those kids.
<b>PT:</b> Well that would be it, marriage wouldn't even be on the table till the kids are out of high school.
<b>DR:</b> Marriage is not on the table, so what is she trying to get you into a commitment now for 4 years down the road?
<b>PT:</b> Subconsciously, probably.  I don't think she's that [INAUDIBLE] to planning this. 
<b>DR:</b> Don't underestimate.  You know, I'm trying to think of her game, trying to squeeze you into a marital commitment, more what, you know, what else do you think she'd do, [INAUDIBLE], you know what I mean, you know, she really doesn't have options, you know, and she can't marry someone else, she just can't marry someone but she wants things set up for when she is free to go right into.  I think you're playing this the right way.
<b>PT:</b> I'm not going to commit to anything I'm not comfortable with and I've said that to her and I've never said in so many words, you know, that that's no good there's the door, I've never said that.  I just tell her it's the truth, I'm very happy with where we are, life is great, I love having you in my life and what we do together is wonderful, I don't want to change anything.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Everything, I mean exercise
<b>DR:</b> Especially summertime, you guys spent a lot of time.
<b>PT:</b> A lot of biking, kayaking, exercising, the only thing she doesn't share with me is my love for sports.  She's not going to sit down and watch a ball game.
<b>DR:</b> Does she tolerate it?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty good about.  She wants to know, she doesn't want surprises.
<b>DR:</b> Do you have to know which games you're going to be watching?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, you know, pretty much and I'm not somebody who's an addicted, the only 1 I'm addicted to his basketball season, watching games, and she can live with that.  You know, I don't go crazy on Sundays with the NFL or the Yankees every night, it's not like that, so you know.
<b>DR:</b> And I guess the guy friends, everyone is married already and it's not as, there's not as much going out with guys.
<b>PT:</b> True, it's getting smaller, you know, it's just a little awkward, a lot of her friends in town have the kids and they're older so doing the couple thing with them is a little uncomfortable.
<b>DR:</b> Not a fun crowd.
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> Guys in their 60's.
<b>PT:</b> They're not that old, they're not that old, there are a couple of couples that aren't bad. 
<b>DR:</b> She's like 50, right?
<b>PT:</b> She's 50.
<b>DR:</b> And so, yeah, [INAUDIBLE] 55.
<b>PT:</b> She's got friends ranging from 42 to 55.
<b>DR:</b> Listen, people are people, some can be, you know
<b>PT:</b> Right
<b>DR:</b> But in general, age kind of tapers down [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> And another issue that has come up and I think we've hopefully solved it and this like was back some time when I told you, she had been drinking a lot of wine and she's been good, you know, she used to have a glass every night or 2 glasses every night and that's when I told her, you know, you're drinking all the time, I don't like it when you drink and she's been very good about really cutting off or 1glass of wine once in a while.
<b>DR:</b> Listen, having known her for a while, right, January of 2000, this is a woman who you've been by far the most satisfied with.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> Out of everyone, so that has to say something.
<b>PT:</b> Oh yeah.
<b>DR:</b> And especially given that she's older and, you know, she's got kids.  There are enough reasons to run away and you ain't running so fast so I've got to be impressed with her and the relationship even though she may be a little nutty, you know, you're willing to tolerate it so she must be very special. 
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, I'm able to do things with her I've never done with a girl, like in terms of my physical exercise and that's important to me.  You know, I've lost relationships in the past where she would just want to sit around and do nothing and I want to go for a walk, for a bike ride, do something active and [NAME OTHER] does and that's great and she'll plan it which I need sometimes.  Sometimes I won't plan if she says come on, we're going to do this, okay, it's like oh [INAUDIBL]
<b>DR:</b> So you're very compatible.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, yeah.
<b>DR:</b> How's the sex these days?
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> So is your low sex drive about her specifically?  You know, not to get into child molesting things, but I mentioned that there's some pretty young women in school, does that still charge you up or are you finding in general that's - 
<b>PT:</b> There's a woman teacher next door to me, she's been there for a few years, she's wonderful, you know, from the neck up, you know, I'd love to jump all over her but from the waist down, [INAUDIBLE].  I'm just accepting that that's my body and [INAUDIBLE].
<b>DR:</b> Because she's not, her body's not great or - 
<b>PT:</b> Who the other girl?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.
<b>PT:</b> Oh no, it is but what I'm saying is, I look, I think with any woman anywhere but, you know, the bloods not flowing to go and get it so to speak, albeit for [NAME OTHER] or albeit for anyone else.
<b>DR:</b> And it didn't change off the Lexapro, right.
<b>PT:</b> I didn't think so, no.
<b>DR:</b> And you know, [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> Yeah and I still haven't gone for a physical.
<b>DR:</b> I mean it was many years ago we checked it but it was so high normal then, 576, that I highly doubt - 
<b>PT:</b> She gave me another name.
<b>DR:</b> Yeah just to check it.  Anyone with low sex drive, you should check but I doubt it's [INAUDIBLE].  Do you wake up with erections?  When's the last time you did?
<b>PT:</b> Well this morning but I think it's because I had to pee.
<b>DR:</b> Well, no, you usually wake up with both an erection and the need to pee but do you frequently wake up with an erection in the morning?
<b>PT:</b> No.
<b>DR:</b> And do you remember 5 years ago that you used to?
<b>PT:</b> I don't remember.
<b>DR:</b> Because that's the other side and also erections during to sleep.  If you don't have morning erections then it's worth checking into [INAUDIBLE] at some point.  Are we agreed to stay on the Lexapro at this point?
<b>PT:</b> I guess.  I wouldn't mind doing 5.
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE] I don't think you have to tell her anything.  She doesn't have to know you're on anything.  I mean for her it resonates with some experience she has with someone else but has nothing to do with you and your brain.  Keep her out of it, it's your brain, it's your medicine, it's none of her business.  Now we could try the Wellbutrin this time but, you know, you're definitely not getting side effects from Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin gives you energy so it's probably not worth going off that.  To be honest, we don't have a great case for going off Lexapro anyway because it looks like you're not getting side effects but certainly if 5 was the same, just break them in half, just because it's less of something in your body.  Do you want to do the 5's?
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.
<b>DR:</b> All right, they don't come in 5's.
<b>PT:</b> They're so tiny that I can't even break them, I've got like a nail clipper.
<b>DR:</b> And you take 1of the Wellbutrin every morning
<b>PT:</b> Three hundred.
<b>DR:</b> Do you need prescriptions?
<b>PT:</b> I do, of both actually.  You guys called one in but I think it was only for 30 days.  Doc, where'd you get this clock?
<b>DR:</b> Sharper Image.
<b>PT:</b> That's at Sharper Image?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah.  And it matches the d退cor too.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah.  Where you at [INAUDIBLE] at all over the summer?
<b>DR:</b> Yeah, yeah, spent 3 weeks there, in fact, just got back yesterday.  I can't find my prescription pad.  
<b>PT:</b> Are you going back to the [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>PT:</b> [INAUDIBLE]
<b>DR:</b> You seem fine to me.  You seem chipper, in your usual state, that's good.  You know, 1 thing, we know you've had depressive illness your whole life and you've been fine for a bunch of years on these meds.  Some people, separate from their depressive illness, just have an irritability that percolates along and that the serotonin medicines just push down irritability and I know that's true because sometimes you get depressive, someone comes in with depression.  We put you on Lexapro or 1 of those and the depression is still there so you pull it away to try something else, when you pull it away, the irritability, you kind of disentangle depression from irritability because you pull it away and the irritability comes back but not the depression, you know, the depression is still there.  So then you go cure the depression with something else and maybe you can do on off, on off and show very clearly that the SSRI just pushes down irritability
<b>PT:</b> SSRI?
<b>DR:</b> Serotonin medicine, the Prozac just pushes down irritability separate from any depressive illness.  I mean it may be unrelated to depression the fact that going off the Lexapro has made you more angry, made you more irritable or it may be the leading edge of your depression is coming back.  I don't know, I don't think so because you didn't talk about sleep, appetite, concentration, self esteem, energy level, it was really related to irritability.
<b>PT:</b> Yeah, oddly, I didn't nap a lot at the beginning of the summer.  I thought I would, energy is good, [INAUDIBLE] sleep and sleep.
