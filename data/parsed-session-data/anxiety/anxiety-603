I SOLD MY cottage, my kittens and my overgrown garden in
Berkshire, and went for interview at a famous school near Glastonbury.
I drew near. I sighted a lolloping farmer-like figure,
back view, white cricket boots slung round its shoulders, with a
head the shape of the sun. It was lolloping right into that element,
silhouetted dark against the orange glow.


I stopped to give it a lift. It talked to me of cricket, the school,
cider and many matters of much importance, and informed me
how to handle my interview. We exchanged names. It was my
first meeting with Robert Bolt, who was, at that time, head of
the English Department at Millfield School, where I was going
for interview. He taught English, as only a genius can, from an
upturned boat in an old Nissen hut.


I was appointed to the post. Bob and I became close friends
and neighbours, and a year later he scored his first great success
in the theatre with <i>Flowering Cherry</i>, gave my wife away at our
wedding and lent us a hundred pounds to get married on.


I began re-organising the art department in a greenhouse
which allowed the pupils to watch their plants blooming, inch
by inch, as they drew. It was really a unique and delightful
experience.


Again my legs went wrong. I travelled to London, was
operated upon, and returned to Somerset intent upon aiding
the new flow of blood in my legs, which I did by stumping
round the orchards and lanes. I sensed a link between the juice
which my foot on occasion crushed out of an apple, during these
orchard rambles, and the new life forces within my legs.


I stayed with Jane and David Cory-Wright in their enchanting
house, set in an orchard, close to Glastonbury Tor; their care and
kindness were to change the whole direction of my life dramatically

[p. <i>138</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00171&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I owe my wife to that old charming iron.


I travelled again to London for permission to work standing,
when the two weeks recuperation had elapsed. My heart filled in
the bare winter fields with posies of flowers, as the train dashed
towards Paddington. The pain in my left leg was the natural
outcome, I persuaded myself, of the recent operation. Or was
probably psychosomatic.


A nurse unwound the dressings in Outpatients. "We both saw
the cause of the trouble, its results stained ochre and crimson and
woven into the gauze. Our reactions were different. She cool
and calm, dismissed the erring dressing into a bin, in the way she
would discard a rotten tomato in the kitchen; then she stood,
arms behind her back, waiting for instructions. The surgeon's
sentence was short. "You'll have to stay, I'm afraid." But for me,
at that moment, it was a sentence of death.


I was allowed a few minutes to collect some necessary articles
from the hospital shop, the usual array, soap, flannel, toothbrush,
lavender talcum-powder, a razor, all the toilet articles which
would soon become stickily associated in the bedside locker and
soften the hairbrush bristles overnight. I had not even one book
with me.


Disconsolately, with a limp as much in my heart as my leg, I
made my way to the ward. Back to square one yet again.


I knew only too well what I should find in the ward. Wards
have one quality in common with the Roman Catholic faith.
Their dogma and pattern are the same the world over. The
lockers, the towels, the envelope-folded beds, the disconsolate
pairs of wireless headphones, the reading lights which immediately
suggest that you will have time to read the whole of

[p. <i>139</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00172&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But in this ward I found the unexpected. Through the open
door I saw, by the bare brown locker, the most beautiful nurse in
the world. She was the Archangel Gabriel herself. She wore a
Swiss watch (or so it seemed) upside down on her bib: it had a
neat red cross inscribed upon it. When she spoke, her charming
accent further persuaded me that this angel of mercy had bloomed
amongst the wild flowers of the Alps, her childhood days marked
by the chimes of a cuckoo clock and her cheeks rouged in red by
the snow. But my geography proved inaccurate; this beautiful
girl had bloomed amongst the tulip fields of Holland, her childhood
punctuated by guttural German voices and machine-gun
fire.


Certainly I added charm to my simmering anger as I helped
her sort out my name, address, age, religion, number of teeth,
temperature and wide interests. I readily held out my arm for the
pulse take, and with no surprise registered the rise in my temperature,
as the nurse neatly marked the effects she had had upon
me on the chart.


I had never really overcome my shyness with girls, due in some
measure to my illness in Greece, and this shyness increased in
proportion to the attraction of the girl. I had developed, in the
prideful way man does, a technique which gave the outside world
the impression that my love affairs were legion and no film hero
would get a look in--essentially a protective device to compensate
for my lack of success. I left the art school with the reputation
of a Don Juan. Add to this a face (particularly with a cigar in it)
and a figure which suggest that I have just come from an expansive
luncheon at the Savoy, and you will see that the picture of
me, to the outside world, differs somewhat from the real and

[p. <i>140</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00173&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

My future wife then ran me a bath.


Now I sank into the deep Victorian bath in the first flush of
renewed hope. In the soothing warm water my seething anger
changed into something soft and lathery. I began to sing. I sang
until there was a severe rap upon the door and that charmingly
accented voice said, "Please be a little quieter, Mr. Rossiter, you're
disturbing all the patients." How dare patients sleep, I thought,
with such beauty around. And so my mood changed, cleansed by
the water and hope. While vigorously rubbing myself dry, I was
already planning a return to teaching, if necessary in a wheelchair.
By the time I was back in the ward I had determined a
course of action. A telephone by the bedside; the future could be
straightened. The Ministry of Pensions would surely provide a
wheelchair and it would then be possible to resume teaching at
the first opportunity. I ate an enormous dinner and was in a
happy state of mind to meet the surgeon's inspection late in the
evening.


When the door of my room closed that evening, with the
telephone installed by the bed, and my legs re-bandaged, I felt
more than another door opening. It seemed that the windows
were blown open too and that I was floating out into a world of
known and unknown bliss. My mind soared into regions of pure
heaven.


My wife's version of our first meeting, in that January ward at
St. Thomas', is different from mine. She maintains that, having
shown me my room, she returned to the Ward Sister and said,

[p. <i>141</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00174&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I certainly was very angry when I just glimpsed her, probably
unshaven, and was wearing a battered old army overcoat. I had
only come to London for a final leg inspection, with a return
ticket to Somerset in my pocket. I had merely come for permission
to resume teaching. My whole future again seemed in
jeopardy; the teaching post, so recently won, seemed to be slipping
through my fingers. I had already had a month's leave
from teaching, at the start of the term, to allow the operations
time to heal. I had promised to resume work after visiting
London.


My life has never been a simple one; many of the complexities
which fill it stem from my complex and irrational nature. Impulse
has very often created situations which, in retrospect, belong to
the world of Alice in Wonderland or Walter Mitty. So that if you
move to a scene, set not far from St. Thomas' Hospital, on the
bridge in St. James' Park, on which a dark, squat, gesticulating
figure is verbosely discussing a thousand topics at once, hand in
hand with a pretty nurse, early in February 1957, you will begin
to understand the pattern of the rest of the year. The fact that this
particular pretty nurse did not fully understand English, nor my
impassioned discourses on the paintings at the Tate, to where we
went on this first date, did not matter. I was in love with the
bridge over the pond, the beads of water on the ducks' beaks,
winter, London's loneliness, myself, the Guardsmen, the paintings
at the Tate, the glistening, rainswept roads and this beautiful
nurse. And I tried to convey all this in a few hours.


It was a miracle to me that I was free of hospital in such a short
time, out in the wintry desolation of London, and heading back
for Somerset. I was allowed to walk as much as I liked, but not to
stand. It is no metaphor to say that I swept my future wife off her
feet. So intensely joyous did I feel, and so much did my spirits
soar, that I swept all before me. There was no taxi to be found

[p. <i>142</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00175&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In Paddington I bought two tickets, the one for myself back to
Somerset, the other a return for Anneka to Chippenham. It
seemed the obvious and delightful end to this day, she and I dining
<i>Ã  deux</i> on the train while it rollocked along, heading for the West
Country. My romantic imagination was further increased by the
warmth and comfort of the first-class carriage, in which I had
grandly booked. The restaurant attendant allowed me to prop up
my legs. Regally we dined, with wine and brandy, and all the
time I was discoursing on the exquisite grandeur and potentialities
of life; and all the time it was raining, and growing darker and
darker outside, and the grey-white beads of moisture cloistered
themselves over the windows, which had to be wiped to discover
at which station, if any, the train had stopped. The very patterns
which my hand made upon the window made me exclaim even
more upon the mystery and potentialities of life, its magic and
possible meaning. The smear upon the pane resembled a lake, a
vast expanse of darkly brooding water seen from the air, and encircled
by a myriad array of minute conifers, clustering round like
gazelles drinking at an evening watering place. As the window
gently steamed over again, I was reminded of mist, and I found
myself explaining those paintings we had so recently seen at the
Tate--particularly Turner's 'Rain, Steam and Speed'. We were
enveloped in a world which he might have painted himself; here
we were hurtling through the late evening, prophetically affirming
the great painter's vision. However there was nothing vaporous
about our dining-table, the glasses, plates, cups, and saucers
nor the bottle of wine; they represented Manet, not Turner.


Our speed had been hindered by the rain and mist, so that on
arrival at Chippenham we found the return connection had
departed. Anneka was stranded. I had visions, at that moment, of
death and disease rampaging through a ward robbed of one of its
nurses. "It's all right," said Anneka comfortingly, "I'm not on

[p. <i>143</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00176&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

We found an exchanting small hotel for Anneka inWestbury.
I assured her, after her bewildered glance at a cluster of antlers in
the hall, that we were not in the Highlands but in the West
Country. Her confidence seemed to return and she smiled again.
As I settled the bill and the next morning's taxi, I felt like the
Good Samaritan at that Biblical inn two thousand years ago; "I'll
pay thee more on my return". And so we parted.


Occasionally, these days, we drive past the telephone box near
Glastonbury from where I rang the next morning to see if Anneka
was all right. It has a special place in our affections, for it was on
that line that she first said, 'good-bye, darling'. But much was to
happen, many angsts and fears reared up their troublesome heads,
before finally we married at the end of the year.


The wheelchair was waiting for me in the art room at Millfield
School. I was the richer by a new form of bandaging, freedom to
work again, and a fine friend in the young nurse. Life was good
again; the orchards would be foaming within three months, a
sight to heal any sore.


I set up home in a very large room at 'The Rose and Portcullis'
in Butleigh, directly above the bar. The proprietor and his wife,
Arthur and Beat Pope, made me one of the family and extended
help in many ways. I settled into the pattern of Somerset village
life and learnt the inside rhythm from this simple pub. When my
legs recovered and I was fit again, I was to experience the joys of
skittles, scrumpy, and village cricket followed by bread, cheese
and onions. Sometimes a table laden with pigs' trotters was
spread before us after a match and we ate this country fare,
washed down by ample beer and scrumpy, into the early hours
of the morning. It was a simple and basic life, as near to the land
as I had ever got. The pub was situated in an idyllic village just
three miles from where I taught. Most evenings it rang with
much laughter and coarse ribaldry, the scent of manure, cornfields

[p. <i>144</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00177&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I began teaching from a wheelchair. My spirits were soaring,
the pendulum in easy motion again. I was not allowed to stand,
but could drive the car and then walk short distances. Teaching
from a wheelchair was no easy matter; I had to direct the art room
from this sitting position, which did not suit my active temperament.
I itched to be more extrovertly active, instead of barking
orders like the 'Man Who Came to Dinner'. Teaching in this
manner left me exhausted emotionally but not physically. It was
one of the severest tests I have known; it required the maximum
of self-discipline and planned action from day to day. I had to rely
on the pupils to do most of the manual jobs, which I could have
done in half the time myself. The hanging of paintings, framing,
drawing from the standing position, were all virtually impossible.
I learnt much from this three-month trial; once again I was forced
to improvise and do the best with the limited means at my disposal.
If I was teaching drawing to a pupil who was standing at
his easel, I had to view the group of objects from an entirely different
eye level, possibly a different angle. This taught me a great
deal, for I had to imagine the other viewpoint. I was therefore
involved in a really creative way of drawing (or seeing), with no

[p. <i>145</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00178&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It was of course a time of great frustration. I would return to
my room utterly exhausted emotionally and would sleep until
supper time. Then, propped up in Arthur and Beat's back parlour,
I would join in the evening's entertainment, consuming more
than my share of scrumpy and joining in the hilarious singing
which wafted in from the bar. They were good evenings which
did much to revive my tired spirits so that I was ready next morning
for renewed battle.


I would sit in the bathroom, legs propped on a second chair,
shaving into a looking-glass leant against the window. Beyond
the glass, through the window, the foaming blossoms echoed my
lathered face, white against white; I was reluctant to erase the
foam from my face to reveal the dark brown below. I used to
shave very slowly, savouring the double image of whiteness to
the full. It was a fine start to the day. The white bath behind me
seemed grey indeed against the other whitenesses.


My legs recovered. Spring finally exploded in all its splendour.
The birds sang their sweetest songs once more. The corn peeped
through, as green as green, oh so seriously, and before long there
was the scent of hay and the glory of long summer evenings. Bob
Bolt, his wife Jo and I spent many an evening in their cottage just
a hundred yards below the pub. He was writing; I was painting.
Life was good. I would listen as Bob read the next few pages of
his play, <i>Flowering Cherry</i>, written after teaching. His voice, with

[p. <i>146</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00179&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During the next few months Anneka and I courted to a pattern
of alternate weekends in Somerset, when we would dine very
lavishly at a nearby club on the evening she arrived, and then
would eke out the remainder of the weekend with fish and chips.
But the carefree spirit which manifested itself so generously as I
welcomed Anneka with outstretched arms at the quiet little
Somerset station, was in fact a spirit not entirely free from care;
and as the weeks passed, so my subconscious fears and uncertainties
increased, strangling my thoughts and making my actions
indecisive.


My legs had healed by the summer and I worked long hours
in the fields painting again; I was filled with joy by the waving
corn, rippling across vast acres and fading to extinction against a
boundary hedgerow. It reminded me of the final effort of a wave
as its last remnants of power trickle gently on to the shore. It
reminded me of the ripples on a pool created by gusts of wind.
But I found a distinction between these two ripplings, the one on
the pond somehow finite and cold, the one over a cornfield immeasurably
magnificent and yet possessing an echo of eternal
sadness.


It was such a mood which swept over me when I waved goodbye
to Anneka at the station at the close of one of our weekends.
I was filled with a poignant sadness, and yet felt relief that I was
alone again, free of responsibilities and decisions. And so my indecisiveness
grew; until it became the basis of a psychosomatic
illness, which is worth relating, both as proof of the power

[p. <i>147</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00180&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As autumn approached, so my gaiety disappeared; not only did
my mood echo this nostalgic season, but also I found that I desired
only to sleep. As soon as my teaching was done for the day,
I would return to my pub room and sleep until the next morning.
As the weeks passed, the more I slept. I just could not understand
it; I was perfectly fit, the legs not troubling me very much, and
yet all I wished to do was sleep.


Then one evening Bob Bolt explained (with the aid of a bottle
of whisky) the workings of the subconscious to me. It was the
submerged portion of the iceberg which did the damage to a
ship, not the glittering upper formation. I was strangled by a fear
of marriage and the ensuing responsibilities. After a few hours,
my subconscious was delightfully submerged in whisky, and I
was again a man of action.


Bob gave Anneka away in the Parish Church in Street. I was
wearing a double-breasted blue suit, which my father had recently
sent me, and which, being not entirely tailored to my
figure, made me feel even more inadequate than I usually do. I
was constantly reminded, as I stood facing the altar, waiting for
Anneka, hands perspiring alternately, that 'clothes maketh a man'.
I did not feel at all like myself or like a man; and what small interior
part of me did remain masculine was closely linked in a sort
of reversed Oedipus complex with my father, through the suit,
which prompted memories of my parents' broken marriage. The
suit symbolised all the qualities which I lacked; in particular the
coat lapels, so flat and manly, and the trouser turn-ups breaking
with such ease and nonchalance upon my shiny black shoes, emphasised
the charade in which I seemed to be acting. The iceberg
was chilling my spiritual emotions, although it never froze
the tiny beads of perspiration glistening in the palms of my
hands.


When the photographs appeared a few days later, I clearly saw

[p. <i>148</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00181&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But the sun, both literally and metaphorically, shone forth
when we arrived back at 'The Rose and Portcullis', where we
held the reception. Crammed into the front bar were tables laid
with white cloths and loaded with a Sassoonian feast of hams,
pigs' trotters, bread and cheese and onions; limitless beer and
stronger fare were near at hand. The sun crept in through a
coloured window, staining a corner of the table in violent yellow,
green and crimson. I was suddenly filled entirely with delight; I
noticed the rich brown bottles of ale singing their particular
golden earthy song, as the sun blessed them for a moment. The
room was full of hope and cheer and love. As the party came to
an end, and Anneka and I climbed into my army van to drive to
our honeymoon in Porlock, I felt a man again.


We spent three days at a charming small hotel in Porlock; it
was three days before Christmas. The sea sparkled grey blue
below us as we walked vigorously over the cliffs, through bare
winter woods. They were entirely perfect days. We returned to
spend our first married Christmas with Bob and his family. Our
home was still my large room at the pub. Poor Anneka had to
face Rabelaisian jokes as we passed through the bar to get to the
room. No sooner did I appear in the bar than I was greeted with
music hall sallies such as, "Ahh, sir, 'ee do look tirred, reel worn
out. Don't 'e, Fred?" It was obvious that we must find our own
home quickly. My happy, carefree bachelor days were past. It
would be the Saloon Bar in the future.


Fortune favoured us. A few days after Christmas we found a
four-roomed gardener's cottage overlooking Wells. It belonged
to a large Victorian house which was owned by a family who had,
in the most lovely fashion, resisted the times of change. The
house, in decoration, mood and spirit, had stopped still in 1910.
We were to become close friends of the Jenkins family and they

[p. <i>149</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00182&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

The cottage had no electricity; it was gas lit. It had a miraculous
view over Wells, stretching away to the Tor at Glastonbury. It
would be difficult to better that view. As there was a high wall
outside the downstairs room, we made our sitting room upstairs
and thus gained full possession of the view. We scrubbed, decorated
and polished our four rooms, our first home. Within a week
there were arrangements of flowers straight from the Dutch
seventeenth century. Our home sparkled and shone with Vermeeresque
perfection. There was only one snag! the bath. This
was a primitive affair. Standing at one end was a vast copper urn
which was filled with water by a hosepipe from the one tap. The
urn perched over the bath, seated on a huge gas ring.We filled the
urn, lit the gas, prayed silently and waited an hour. By this time
the room was hysterically full of steam and we groped about to
turn off the gas. We were to learn very speedily that to run the
boiling water into the bath, before filling it with cold, was a fatal
mistake. No sooner had you sat down, the urn end, than you
were standing up again. And not sitting comfortably again for
quite a few days. Fortunately for Anneka, and unfortunately for
me, this was my discovery during the first bath I took. I never
made that mistake again. And so we settled, almost comfortably,
down to the first few months of married life. I was still teaching
five and a half days a week, which was a great strain; for suddenly
I was filled with a myriad ideas and working at my painting
and writing every possible moment. Marriage, and the security
of my first real home since childhood, had unleashed the enormous
energies struggling within me.


I have purposely, at certain points in this story, described in
some detail, day-to-day life and its trivialities. For everything, in
a pendulum painter's life, is of importance; the apple blossoms,
the ochre sienna scar on the inside of a bath, the bath plug itself,
shaving soap, ripe corn, a battered gate, a winter hedgerow, two

[p. <i>150</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00183&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Recently my wife laid an old pair of shoes on my studio table,
as a reminder that they needed repairing. Near them she laid
some white flowers, ready for arranging and putting in the
house. When I entered the studio I was immediately delighted by
this group; there was no question of taking the shoes to be repaired.
The shoes were just touching at the toes, kissing very
gently, the flowers sprawled across singing another kind of song.
I immediately set to work on this composition. As I worked, the
flowers, in the warmth of the studio, began to wither. By the end
of the composition it was 'Kissing Shoes and Dying Flowers' and
I had spent two days of exhilaration in the presence of these contrasting
objects. They had dominated those two days, the shoes
so peacefully kissing, the flowers dying sadly behind them. This,
I think, illustrates the problems that confront an artist: my shoes
were not mended for some weeks and I was reduced to wearing
one pair. The shoes in my studio became my subject matter and
inspiration for the next month. Constantly this is happening

[p. <i>151</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00184&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Obviously if one lives one's life on this high emotional plane,
there must be at times a considerable swing down. And when this
does come, it is true hell.


Blossom foaming; in its presence I feel a 'lit-upness', not surprisingly;
similarly with ripe swaying corn. The incessant rhythms
of the hedgerows swing and dance in my mind, they streak
through my brain, down my neck, tingle my spine and stream out
of my hands so that when I come to draw, it is almost an intuitive
and unreckonablewith act. I relive that shrieking hedgerow right
through the tips of my fingers. The drawing spills on to the paper
until my appetite for that sight and splendour are satisfied. I
feel a hunger, a greed and a deep compulsion to work. Ditches,
rhythmic broken gates, bric-a-brac on the studio floor, my
streamlike desk, blotting paper, upright bottles, a thousand sights
a day burst me into song and ecstasy. The day is not long enough
to embrace fully the sights I see and love.


All objects to me, almost without exception, possess human
characteristics. An upright bottle is proud, greedy, perhaps pompous,
a cricket bat aristocratic and fine, an armchair deeply wise,
a saucepan sure and contemplative. As I work I converse with
these objects, learning from their wisdom, sadness, dignity and
splendour. The flow and rhythms linking objects catch my eye;
I am fascinated by the continuous link between a battered gate
and an old bucket lying in a ditch. Unity is everywhere, there is a
oneness, the fusion which we all desire so deeply in our daily lives.
A oneness, a lit-upness, a splendour, an eternal song. As I am
writing some keys are hanging from a rack, a neat row of metal
keys. They are sad, forlorn, unwanted, and that is how I should
paint them; but even in their forlornness there is a deep song,
possessing the quality of sadness and beauty which one finds in a
Negro spiritual.

[p. <i>152</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000697842-I00185&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I had just finished writing this paragraph when I had to go to
the garage to fetch a book from the car. My eye was caught by
the stone wall which separates the coalshed from the garage. It is a
wall not quite reaching to the ceiling, with a sturdy beam across
its top. On it were a chance collection of objects which so delighted
me that I feel compelled to mention them, for once again
I found song in the most casual of corners, at the most unexpected
moment. The beam stretches twenty feet across the stones, some
five feet above the floor. On it are some of the rubbish which my
wife has recently thrown out; pale pink flower pot; a sagging
sack, overlapping the beam and linking it to an old ironingboard,
just peeping over the top; a grey-green upright bottle,
dead centre; a horseshoe linking this to a red box; behind this
box two rotting timbers, worm-eaten; a piece of hardboard
links this group to a sienna brown box, perfectly rectangular,
and on this is perched a pale honey coloured (oh so thin) fruit
basket. And on the right, in the corner, is a dull red sackcloth,
quiet and humble. The whole group is static, Chardin-like in
simplicity and grandeur. I am hypnotised by it, and when my
writing is finished for the day, I shall paint from it. I am only just
able to drag myself away and write in the studio.


A few days after I had been so much delighted by the array of
objects which had surfaced in the garage, and had worked some
drawings from them, and just when life seemed so full of harmonies,
both my writing and my painting were suddenly, and
frighteningly, blocked. I was unable to complete this chapter
and spent fruitless hours tearing quarter-filled pages to pieces in
despair. Outside, it was a gloriously fine summer evening, the
sky Turneresquely beautiful. But none of this fiery, eternal spirit
entered into me as I gazed disconsolately out of the window. I
decided to take the car out and seek joy in different trees and
gates and hedgerows. The ones set so still before me, outside the
studio window, had no significance.


I find driving through the countryside to be like reading some

This particular evening, as I drove along, the magnificent sky
and darkening hedgerows did little to change my mood. It
seemed that I was set for a real and vicious swing, away from all
that I usually loved. Quite suddenly, on a bend in the road, I saw a
bright red notice board with a large white arrow pointing to the
right. Somehow it was exactly right. It was a well balanced and
planned sign, set firmly in position. It had a certainty and purpose.
Its intention, to guide unwary drivers safely round the corner,
pleased me. It had a touch of humour too, tempting me for a
moment not to turn the corner, but to make straight for the signboard
and fly headlong through it, a dog through the white circus
hoop.


I looked down at my wristwatch. My wrist was bare; the
watch was in my pocket. But in its place was a wonderfully pale
strip where the sun had not touched my arm. Quite suddenly,
these sights, the neat white strap mark and the white arrow peeping
out of the hedgerow, pushed the pendulum. It began to swing
to a faster and more melodious rhythm. I was happy again.
