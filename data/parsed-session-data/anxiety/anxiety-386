Soon after arriving home in 1944, I began to attend Park
Place Methodist Church in Norfolk with my family. I joined the
Men's Bible Class, which my father had been attending for
several years. Early in 1945 I requested the pastor to procure
my church membership from my old home church in North
Carolina. My wife, being a member of the Baptist denomination
at the time, decided she would come into the Methodist Church
with me, as our two daughters wished to join with me. We, as a
family, united with the church on the same day. We attended
all services regularly, and the girls became members of the
choirs for their respective age groups. I was soon asked to assist
in ushering and other activities.


Not long after arriving home I obtained a position as salesman
with the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company,
working out of the branch office in Norfolk. In the course of
seeking clients, I called upon my pastor in his study to inquire
about his insurance needs. On my first visit I endeavored only
to acquaint him with my company and the different kinds of
programs we offered to men in his position. He told me what
his present insurance was, and we agreed that he should have
additional coverage. During the following month I made two or
three appointments with him to talk further on the matter, and
show him some definite plans I had made to fit his needs. Then,
when we came to an agreement about insurance, I said, "Doctor,
I guess you wonder why I am home early from the war."


"No, I hadn't thought about it with any degree of wonder.
We do appreciate what you are doing here at the church."


"I sure have been greatly helped by the manner in which we

[p. <i>212</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00212&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Harrell, you know that is one of the things none of us can
fully understand. God can do wonderful things with our weak
efforts. I just hope that I have been helping you and all to know
how wonderful God is!"


"Doctor, I do have quite a heavy load to carry these days. I
wonder if you would do me the favor of going into the sanctuary
with me, and saying a little prayer for me?"


He appeared to be glad that I had asked. He got up from
his desk, and said, "It would be indeed a pleasure to do that." He
placed his hand on my shoulder as he opened his study door.


Kneeling in the quietness of that large sanctuary at the altar
rail, with this man of God that I admired very much, I felt a
bond of love and understanding. It convinced me that selling
insurance was not what I really wanted to do. His sermons over
the past several months had been reviving in me my great desire
to fulfill what God had for me to do with my life. He prayed
a very simple and sincere prayer for us both, and in closing his
prayer he said, "Harrell, say a little prayer for your preacher."


My response was something like this: "O God, I thank thee for
letting me get to know this man. Keep on using him to help
these Thy people, and keep him full of love for all. Amen."


When we stood up there were tears in his eyes, and mine
were just brimming over, I know. It was a joyous occasion, and
one that has meant much to me through the years. Going out
through the educational building to the street door, I said,
"Thanks. One of these days I would like to talk to you about
my experiences."


"I would be delighted to see you any time," he said, and we
shook hands. I went thoughtfully and joyously down the street
toward my car.


As time went by, this preacher began to call upon me to do
certain things—to lead in prayer at the Wednesday evening

[p. <i>213</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00213&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During 1946, as I covered the city looking for, and talking
to, clients, I was constantly looking upon the life of the city. I
was entering homes of friends and strangers, talking about
security and money matters. I felt on many occasions that financial
security was not the real need of many of the homes; they
needed God, love, hope, and, above all, purpose in life. The
thing that impressed me most was that very few people were
working because they loved what they were doing. My job of
constantly trying to sell future security became a burden to me,
and I found that I was in the same boat with all the rest I began
to ask myself, "How long can this go on without my really cracking
up?"


One day during this period I was at the downtown bus station
chatting with some of the drivers I had worked with before
going into the Navy, and one of them asked me to go with him
to North Carolina. I didn't have anywhere special to go; so I
decided to take the day off and visit my home town, which was

[p. <i>214</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00214&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Well, I haven't started to preach, but I am going to church.
It still looks like some preaching wouldn't hurt around here," I
said, kidding him.


This man and I had played poker together and been on
drinking parties many times. Ill tell you right now that if you
were the preacher I'd sure go to church," he said, getting a big
laugh from the whole group.


"You guys think I'm kidding? I think I'm going to back you
down. If I were to preach here, would all of you come?"


All in the group said they surely would. One man said, "I'll
be sitting right in the front row."


"All right. Don't forget that it's a promise," I said, as I prepared
to leave. "See you in church."


As I crossed the street, I noticed the Baptist Church not far
away, and recalled that the parsonage of the preacher was just
behind it, facing the other street I walked toward the church
and circled around to the rear, where there was a monument
marking a grave. I recalled my grandfather's telling us that some
of our people had founded this church. I went on through to
the parsonage and knocked on the front door. A very pleasant
young man came to the door and invited me in. I introduced
myself. He knew my brothers, who were living there in the town
at the time. I told him some of my religious experiences, and of
the encounter I had had with some of the men downtown. I
said, "Everyone in this town knows me, and they know what
I was before God changed my life. If you would arrange it, I
would be glad to come some Sunday night and tell just what my
Lord means to me. I'm not a preacher, but I think I can give
my testimony before my friends."


He seemed very interested and took my name and address.
In a few days I received a letter from him inviting me to speak

[p. <i>215</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00215&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

When the hour came, and with the Baptist minister I stepped
out through the rear door leading into the pulpit and saw the
church overflowing with people that I had known all my life, I
had a feeling that words cannot describe. Before me was my
entire family—mother, father, sister, brothers, wife, children,
aunts, nieces, nephews, and schoolmates and many others—drinking
pals, gambling pals, and the very judge who had fined me
several times in court. I did the best I could to tell what a
glorious feeling it was to be forgiven and restored by the Lord.


During the weeks that followed I was invited to speak in
other churches in the town, and in many in the surrounding area.
During the years, I have been back several tunes to the Baptist
and Methodist churches. I was invited on two occasions to speak
in the Pilgrim Holiness Church, and I did. (This was during
1946 and 1947.)


In the late summer of 1946 I noticed that I was losing interest
in selling insurance. I felt that I had to talk to someone who
could advise me. So I approached my preacher, Dr. Enge, one
Sunday morning after the service. "Dr. Enge, I sure would like
to talk to you tomorrow—if you are going to be in town."


"Sure, Harrell. Come to the study about ten. I'll be there."


The next morning I left my office and went to the pastor's
study. In my brief case I had the bound typewritten copy of my
story as I had written it in the hospitals. On my entering the
study, Dr. Enge greeted me very cordially and invited me to sit
down. I said, "This visit is not about insurance. However, if
you've changed your mind, I've still plenty left," I said, smiling.


"What's on your mind, Harrell?" he asked, leaning back in his
chair.


"Too much," I said seriously. "One of the things that has
worried me for quite some time is the question of how one knows
what he ought to do. How does one know when he is a
Christian?"

[p. <i>216</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00216&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Harrell, the Bible says that if we love the brethren, by this
we know. Let's see, that is found in one of the letters of John,"
he said, as he reached over and picked up his Bible. "Here it is.
‘We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
love the brethrea’" (I John 3:14).


I sat thoughtfully for a moment "If that means what I think
it means, then it must be that my spirit is Christian, for I do love
those who are in the church. Of course, I try to love everybody,
but the feeling I have among men like you is very agreeable to
me. Oh, I know that I'm making a mess of trying to put it into
words." I finished, in a bit of frustration.


"No, you are not, Harrell. That is the heart of the matter. If
we love with the kind of love that Jesus shows he had, then we
can think of ourselves as His followers."


"Doctor, you know that verse of Scripture helps me a lot. My
experience while in the Navy was that of passing from death unto
life. Many times I have looked back on my past life and thought
about it in that way. Lately, I have been telling my home-town
friends about what the Lord means to me."


"We have been missing you at some of our Sunday evening
services. Is that where you have been going?"


"Yes. You see, I came from a small town in North Carolina,
and I made a talk there not long ago, and I have been invited
back several times. That is one thing that is troubling me now.
I'm getting to like it too much. I don't seem able to be satisfied
with just selling insurance."


"That is the way it works. This business of telling others about
what the Lord means to you is wonderful."


I looked down at the floor a bit embarrassed, and realized
that Dr. Enge was a bit concerned, too. I said haltingly, "Dr.
Enge, there's something that I feel I must tell you. At this present
moment I am considered one hundred per cent mentally disabled
because I wanted to tell others about what the Lord had
done for me while in the Navy."


"Oh, come nowl Who in the world considers you disabled—
and mentally at that?"

[p. <i>217</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00217&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"The Veterans Administration. I am a disabled veteran and
am drawing full pension even while I am making over four
hundred a month in insurance."


"Well, I've known you quite a while, and I would say somebody
has made a mistake."


Reaching down for my brief case, I took out the bound copy
of the story. I said, "I wonder if you would be interested in
reading my account of what happened." Passing it over to him,
I added, "This is a copy of the material that I wrote while in the
hospitals. If you would go over it and advise me, I would appreciate
it very much,"


He took the book as I stood up, and flipped it open, "I
surely will."


"I know you are a busy man. If you will let me know when
you have finished it, I'll come back, and we can talk about it
with more understanding, I think."


He laid the book on the desk and rose. Taking my hand, he
said, "Harrell, I think a prayer is in order at this time, don't
you?"


"I would surely appreciate it, Doctor." We stood with heads
bowed, and he offered a very heart-warming and sincere prayer.
We parted, and I went to work with a new spirit.


Two weeks passed without word from Dr. Enge. Then on
Sunday morning my phone rang about nine o'clock. It was the
preacher. "Harrell, how about doing me a favor?"


"Sure, Doctor Enge, if I possibly can."


"Well, I have a preacher friend who is sick and wants me to
send someone out to conduct services for him this morning. How
about going out there?"


"Doc, I'm no preacher! What in the world would I say?"


"Just go and tell them what the Lord means to you. You
know where Oak Grove Church is, don't you?"


"Yes, sir. If you want me to go, I'll do it and do my best"


"That's all anyone can do. Ill be thinking about you. I'll call
and tell them to expect you by eleven o'clock."


I hung up the phone and went to the kitchen, where Mattie

[p. <i>218</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00218&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Mattie did not seem too happy. "Harrell, I know you like to
do this sort of thing. But it seems to me you are losing interest
in selling insurance. Are you really happy, Harrell?"


"Mattie, I know that it is hard for you to understand when I
say I feel that I have a greater purpose than just selling insurance
and making money."


"We've got to eat, you know. And the girls want to go to
college. You don't have the education to be a preacher, and I
think you are doing enough in your own church."


"Oh, don't worry about me. You take the children to Sunday
school, and I'll be back about twelve thirty for dinner."


In my anxiety that morning to conduct the worship service
properly, and thinking of the procedure in my own church, I did
not wait for the choir to sing just before the sermon. In my
church the choir rendered the anthem after the offering was
taken. In this church the choir sang before the sermon. After the
singing of the hymn, I remainded standing and began to talk.
After the service was over, my attention was called to what I
had done, and I was really embarrassed.


Soon after this event, and while I was considering accepting
a position with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, I
was informed that Dr. Enge had recommended me for license
to preach in the Methodist Church. I went to his study one
morning as he was leaving to conduct a funeral at a funeral
home in another part of the city. We did not have time to talk,
but he did hand me a book, saying, "Harrell, I got some good
reports about you from Oak Grove. This is very good. Don't you
let what the Veterans Administration thinks worry you."


"Thanks, Doc. I won't if I can help it."


"By the way, I recommended you for license to preach the
other night at our Quarterly Conference," he said, as he went
hurriedly to his filing cabinet "Here's a list of the books you
should study, to prepare for examination. You will go before the
District Committee on May 13, next spring."

[p. <i>219</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00219&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

He handed me the paper, and we walked out into the hallway.
He was answering a lot of questions by his action at this time.
"Doc, I appreciate what you are doing for me."


"Glad to do it. I need a licensed preacher around here to
send out on occasions. You get those books, and we? talk some
more about it."


"I'll do that. Thanks again," I said, shaking his hand. We
parted on the walk outside.


A short time after this, a prominent minister in the Conference
was killed in an automobile accident, and Dr. Enge left
our church to take over the office of District Superintendent
During the next four months I did not have a close relationship
with our new minister, nor did I have an opportunity to see Dr.
Enge. When I was called before the District Committee on May
13, 1947, my new minister was one of the five clergymen who
asked questions concerning my call to preach, and the books I
had been reading. There were two other men who were being
examined by the committee. I was recommended and passed by
vote of the whole group, while one of the other men was turned
down. The chairman signed my license and delivered it to me.


In August of that same year I was invited to preach four
Sundays in one of the city churches while their preacher was
away on vacation. A social worker for the VA who had been
assigned to my case since I returned home, and whom I had told
to find something else to do besides following me around,
attended these services. While conducting these services that
month there was created within me a growing desire to become
a preacher.


I did not know very much about the working of the organized
church at the time. I did not feel that my pastor looked with any
degree of favor upon my educational background. My wife was
not inclined to be very happy about my desire to become a
preacher. All things considered, I was alone in trying to make
up my mind what I should do.


One day late in September, 1947, I was on my way to keep
an appointment with a middle-aged bachelor in the Riverview
section of the city. To get to his apartment house, I decided to

[p. <i>220</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00220&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I did not hear any voices or anything like that. I just felt
that this was the thing for me to do at this time. And the most
unusual thing happened when I approached that prospect. As I
talked to him I saw tears coming into his eyes, and in less than
ten minutes I was leaving the house with a signed application
and a check for a full year's premium in my brief case.


This experience convinced me that I should take some steps
to become what I felt God wanted me to become—a full-time
preacher.


The following Sunday morning there was an announcement
in our church bulletin that the Virginia Conference was to meet
in the city of Roanoke in just one week. Monday morning, I
looked up the address of the superintendent of the Norfolk
District and called him for an appointment later in the day.
Arriving at his home at the appointed time, I was received as
if he had known me quite a long time. I had met him on several
occasions—one being when he had signed my license to preach.
Dr. Willard (he is now deceased) was in his sixties at the time.
As we sat down in the living room, both lighting a cigarette,
Dr. Willard said, "You are a member out at Park Place, aren't
you, Mr. Thach?"


"Yes, sir. We live up on Thirtieth Street Doctor Enge recommended
me for a license to preach last year, before he was
moved. How's he getting along these days?"

[p. <i>221</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00221&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Fine. Just fine. I saw Jack the other day, and he asked
about you."


"Doctor Willard, I think the bug has bitten me. I feel like
I want to preach on a regular basis. That's what I want to talk
to you about."


"The Conference meets next week in Roanoke, and I sure
could use a good man."


"Doctor, I don't have much education; but if you could use
a man like me in a small church somewhere close that doesn't
have a preacher, I would do my best"


"Will you be able to attend the Conference?"


"I might be able to go for a day or so, if you wish."


"How does your wife feel about this?"


"What I had in mind was serving a church near by, so that
my wife and family could still live here, and the children could
keep on attending their present schools. I think she worries about
that more than anything else."


"Right now I don't know how things are going to shape up
at the Conference. I'll keep you in mind, and if you can get to
the Conference, come to see me," he said. I began to prepare
to leave. "Give me your address and phone number, and I'll let
you know as soon as I can find out something definite."


I handed him one of my business cards, saying, "I am generally
in the office mornings."


He took the card. "You will hear from me soon. Thanks for
coming by." We shook hands, and I left him standing in the
door.


The following week I visited the seat of the Conference only
one day. I sat in the balcony of the auditorium and looked down
on what was going on, and it was all Greek to me. I listened to
one or two long speeches on the work that had been done during
the year, and came away with a picture of a great crowd of
people who know one another very well. The most activity that
I saw was that of people shaking hands and talking to one
another in the lobby. It seemed like a very friendly group, and I
wished that I were a part of what was going on, for I felt like

[p. <i>222</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00222&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"This is Doctor Robert Johnson, Superintendent of the Petersburg
District. Am I speaking to Mr. Harrell Thach?"


"Yes, I am Harrell Thach," I said, glancing at my wife, who
did not know about my latest activities.


"Mr. Thach, you were appointed to the South Brunswick
Charge by the Bishop today. Could you meet me at Brodnax
tomorrow morning?"


I did not know where Brodnax was, but I said, "I think I can
do that"


"Okay, I'll meet you at the parsonage there at ten o'clock in
the morning."


"Yes, sir. I'll be there." My wife sat up in bed with a question
on her lips, as I put the phone back in the rack.


"Who was that? What in the world are you up to now?"


"Take it easy, honey. That was the superintendent of the
Petersburg District of the Methodist Church telling me he wants
me to go to work for him."


"He—what? Harrell, you know they'll throw you out of a
church in six months. What in the world are you thinking about?"


We talked long into the night, and I explained that we didn't
have to move. We could live right at home, and I would drive
out week ends to preach.


The next morning I got a map and found out where Brodnax
was. It was more than a hundred miles from Norfolk. I met Dr.Johnson

[p. <i>223</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000084785-I00223&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

After some persuasion, my wife agreed to try it for a while.
We packed our clothes, rented our apartment furnished, and
moved into the parsonage at Brodnax, Virginia, on November
1, 1947.
