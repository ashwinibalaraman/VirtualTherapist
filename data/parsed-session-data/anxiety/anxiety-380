‘ONCE a doctor, always a doctor’ is one of the more
common sayings that informs our professions. So,
though "A Doctor Regrets ...", as I did when the
National Health Service came in, inevitably also "A
Doctor Returns", even though it be in the unusual way
in which the recall came to me.


Here again, then, is a book about doctoring. Perhaps
the main difference between this and my previous book is
that, whereas I wrote in the latter of myself as a doctor
only, now I write of myself as both doctor and patient.
I have no fears that my book will suffer thereby: for,
of the many strange cases I have seen throughout my
medical career, my own--and that of my dear wife,
Betty--are perhaps, in the variety of their medical and
legal problems, the strangest of all.


There is, however, nothing like being at ‘the receiving
end’, there is nothing like field work, particularly for a
Member of Parliament, and, in the course of my story
as doctor-patient, or patient-doctor, I have a number of
comments on doctoring which are, I hope, of interest
and importance.


We live in the days of hush-hush and hugger-mugger.
These are authoritarian times. It could well be true that,
as my friend the historian avers, we catch Continental
political diseases in attenuated form and that we suffer
today from our own genteel brand of National Socialism.
And it is doubtful whether in any sphere of activity
today, the atmosphere is quite so ‘hush-hush’ as it is in

[p. <i>12</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00014&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Thus, on occasions, there may drop an iron curtain of
secrecy behind which anything may happen and through
which no illumination may penetrate. Particularly is
this so with mental illness which lends itself with special
facility to obscurantist practices, yet which is in so
many of its aspects concerned with the liberty of the
individual--liberty in its personal form, so much more
important actually than liberty of property possession,
yet so much less publicized.


It is of one such occasion that I now have to write.


This is a book of personal experience. But let us
suppose at the start that it is not I to whom all that I am
about to relate happens, but that it is you yourself-
or even Mr. Lydia Blackadder of Thurrock, Essex.


It may be that, in your business affairs, or maybe in
your personal life, or maybe even as a conscientious
member of the public, you stumble upon some shocking
revelation--a revelation of such far-reaching importance
as to indicate the subornment of law and order, or
corruption in high places, and perhaps even one which
will affect the reputation and the standing of important
people.


The matter which you have discovered may involve
our national security, or the moral welfare of the community :
but, at any rate, it is a matter of vital importance
and you know what your duty is--it is to get evidence,
to reveal this thing, to ‘blow it uP’. You must sound the
warning to your friends, your relatives, your workmates;
and you place information in authoritative quarters--those
are the essential things to do, the duty of any good
citizen.

[p. <i>13</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00015&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

As you start on your self-appointed task, however, you
find yourself greeted with genuine surprise, combined
with a considerable measure of polite disbelief. But, as
the days go by and you redouble your efforts, talking
to one person and the other, your conviction intensifies.
You are doing the right thing. It is these people around
you, your friends, relatives and workmates who are
starting to act in peculiar fashion--people on whom you
have relied all your life and who have relied on you,
but who are now looking worried and apprehensive, and
obviously regarding you with suspicion. And beyond
them, unsettling them, inspiring them against you are
your rivals--the enemy you are trying to unmask.


It is THEY who are drawing the circle round you to
enclose you.


You are wrongly alleged to be in any state of confusion.
You are not only logical, but your brain is acting in
ultra-logical fashion. You are seeing things too clearly,
with too intense a logic. You are seeing familiar surroundings
with a new sense of revelation--a revelation
in which, however, they have taken on curiously distorted
shapes. This new world is on a par with the distorted
images in the curved mirrors in the booth that is inseparable
from every Fun Fair.


But this is no Fun Fair. It is ghastly serious, and your
brain is racing and racing to cope with the circumstances
that threaten to envelop you. For the people who surround
you are continuing to act in odd fashion--indeed
some of them do not cease behaving in odd fashion many
years later. All around you now the forces of the human
subconscious come erupting in volcanic fashion through
the veneer of polite and expedient behaviour. Separate
personalities become submerged in the tide of antagonism
which rises to overwhelm you like a larval flood. On
every side are hostile gleaming eyes.


In a moment of special insight, you become aware that
you are face to face with the corrupting force that is

[p. <i>14</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00016&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

But these forces are by no means depersonalized. You
are well aware who THEY are, who are the active human
agents of this corruption. You know, too, that the
cunning of your enemy is of a diabolic quality. You are
being ‘framed’ and there is no escape whatsoever you
do. You are being doped and the food that you eat is
being poisoned. You are being observed and spied upon,
your letters are being held by the Post Office which is
infiltrated with spies. There are microphones installed
in your room and everything that you say is being over-heard
and recorded.


Your energies are now wholly devoted towards
escaping these devices. You dash hurriedly round, to the
police for protection, to your solicitor for legal aid, to
the editor of your local paper or your local Press
Association representative for the sanction of publicity
against the secret plotters.


Your perspicacity is, however, not matched by an
appropriate circumspection in your behaviour. Your
slightly improbable story is denied even such credence
as it might otherwise have received, once these worthy
people become aware of your somewhat indiscreet line
of talk. The reserve with which they greet your unorthodox
appearance is only equalled by the embarrassment
caused to your friends and relatives by your violent
rushing to and from on these fruitless journeys.


To you, however, the rebuffs which you receive have
only one explanation. The corrupting influence has
infiltrated right into the established order of society.
Your world, a world maybe built up throughout a
lifetime by work and thrift, by careful management of
your affairs, and confidence in law and order and a

[p. <i>15</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00017&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

By this time, indeed, this thought will be no mere
illusion, no mere figment of your imagination.


For the next person whom you see will be the doctor.
He may be your familiar doctor, but he will undoubtedly
look different to his familiar appearance--his slightly
untidy coiffure will seem to have spruced up, his eye
will have a new glint in it. It may be that you will be
tactless enough to tell him this.


For the mirrors in which your world is reflected are not
consistent in the distortion which they give. Terror is
not the only thing they reflect. Suddenly they change, as
if a fresh set were installed. For some minutes your
surroundings become highly humorous, with a humour
which becomes extremely pointed in its expression.
Then again they change and, hey presto, everything
becomes reflected in terms of sex--perverted and abnormal
sex pervades every action and every intention in
human behaviour. Then once more the mirrors change
and you are grandiose and ‘on top of the world’. You
feel good--as good as you have ever felt in your life
before. But all the time the forces of Evil close you in,
while your efforts to break out become more and more
desperate.


You are now talking all the time. You can choose
your words but, in whatever you say, you must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The
truth as you see it comes bubbling from your lips in a
garrulous, never-ending stream.


‘He that speaketh the truth must have one foot on the
stirrup’ says the old Turkish proverb.


But here you are, speaking the truth amidst the
corruption that surrounds you, however bitter the truth
is, however barbed, however grotesquely humorous:
and yet rooted to the spot and unable to escape.


Indeed, there can only be one escape from the evil that

[p. <i>16</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00018&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Little wonder that the doctor finds you tricky to cope
with. Little wonder that, after a short hour or so's
observation, he wants you removed and ‘off his hands’.


For that purpose he has available (under existing
legislation) a Certificate. It is a Certificate that differs
from the numerous other certificates that encumber the
practise of his profession in that it is spelt with a capital
‘C’. And rightly so, for, though this Certificate can be
completed with almost as little formality as one for an
extra supply of coal, its effect will be to deprive you of
your liberty, your reputation and your control over
your own property for any period up to one year. The
import of the Certificate is to say that that in his opinion
you are ‘a person of unsound mind’ and to direct that
you be removed and detained in a mental hospital.


It only needs the intervention of a magistrate as a
counter-signatory: the magistrate signs and (in most
instances) asks no questions: he presumably takes the
doctor's advice.


Impelled by the same line of reasoning that has
governed you hitherto, you resist this to the uttermost.
The magistrate, however, is then empowered to call a
constable who, in the good old straightforward words
of the Lunacy Act, 1890, ‘shall forthwith convey the
lunatic to the institution named in the order’.


THEY have got you.


As indeed they have.


For you, if you are you--or even Mrs. Lydia Blackadder
of Thurrock, Essex--that will be the end of your
story. Just as for me, being what I am, a doctor, a
lawyer, an autobiographer, a persistent seeker after the
truth, and, as I have said, a Member of Parliament--it is
the beginning of mine.

[p. <i>17</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00019&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

It will be the end of your story because, being by now
a certified lunatic, you will be safely confined with only
stone walls and iron bars and mental nurses to hear you.
Because the doctors, having labelled you ‘paranoiac’,
will cease to take your plaints and accusations seriously.
Because, when you are discharged, you will possibly
not in any case wish to talk about your hospital stay
and the events that brought you to hospital. Because,
even if you want to talk about them, you will find no one
wants to listen to you--least of all, are you likely to obtain
interest from that body whose statutory duty it is
to protect your liberty--the Board of Control. Because
finally, in any attempt to publicize your illness, you
will, since it is mental illness, feel almost as if you are
committing a public indecency.


However, this is my story, and not yours, and I ask
you to accompany me on my journey. Let me take you
by the hand. And hold my hand firmly, for we have
strange sights to see.


Let us step, like Alice, through the Looking Glass--
that Looking Glass, so identical in its John Tenniel
illustration, with the over-mantel in my own Auntie
Alice's Victorian front parlour in the small side-street
house in Bury where I spent so many happy childhood
hours.


The Iron Curtain of which I have spoken melts before
us and here we are in this strange country with its
unfamiliar landmarks and its unusual characters; a
country where people are but insubstantial reflections
of themselves, without rights, without property, without
access to the normal course of justice; where empanoplied
authority will shield the criminal and the trickster, and
only the aggrieved person is a <i>caput lupinum</i>, one hunted
by all without protection.

[p. <i>18</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00020&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Summon up your last ounce of resolution, for we are
going to sojourn in this country, which extends far
beyond the physical barriers of a mental institution, for
some time during the course of this story. During this
time you will have little difficulty in feeling yourself in
Looking Glass Country.


The time is the middle of October of the year 1950--
some years before I got into Parliament--and here I am
in my mental hospital bed, whither I have been conducted
by such a panoply of local authority as one person
has scarcely on any occasion been honoured with.
Police Inspector, plain clothes detectives, magistrate,
duly authorized officer of the local health authority,
they are all present to complete the ritual.


"I am doped," I had told the doctor when he had
called to see me--and, indeed, he wrote it down in
evidence against me. My illness had started with giddy
turns and curious bouts of automatic talking when I
had sat down in a chair and given forth oracular pronouncements,
lasting several minutes at a time: words,
for which I had been a mere passive vehicle, had formed
themselves on my lips and been uttered for the benefit of
anyone who happened to be there to listen to them.


"I am doped," I had protested to the police inspector,
as we stood arguing in the open street in front of the hotel
where I had been staying. But his officers hustled me into
the hired car just the same.


"I am doped," I had told the magistrate, as he sat
opposite me in the car on the way to hospital, but all he
did was to brandish the stub of a cigarette in my face
and mutter something incomprehensible--maybe it is
as well that I did not hear him clearly.


"I am doped," I had shouted on my admission to the
hospital, when for perhaps two moments I was exhibited
to the admitting doctor.


But here I am just the same.


I have been propelled along corridors by helpers to

[p. <i>19</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00021&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

I am still, however, surrounded. As I look round the
ward, I am surrounded by glaring eyes which, so it
seems, seek to dominate me and make me do, I know
not what. To protect myself from these I put the bedclothes
over my face, meanwhile smothering the feelings
of rage that consume me. Never have I exercised greater
self-control.


Eventually I go to sleep. Or is it sleep? It is more a
dream-like state of coma in which I make my delirious
entry into the Western equivalent of a Mahommedan's
paradise. A book about them would be a best-seller
down the Charing Cross Road.


This continues during the succeeding forty-eight
hours, during which I lose count of time--time indeed
is of little importance. Though now and again I
relapse into consciousness and, with it, into my persecuted
and claustrophobic moods, which alternate in
inconsequential fashion with my delirium.


"Jock?" I ask.


"Yes?"


"Am I in gaol?" I think that I am in gaol, accused
of unmentionable offences.


"Gaol?" says Jock. "Gaol? What are you saying,
man? You're in a psychological observation ward."


"Sorry," I reply, "I thought I was a prisoner in the
Cold War."


Indeed I take a great deal of convincing that I am not
a prisoner in the Cold War.

[p. <i>20</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00022&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Get on with you," says Jock. "What do you mean,
Cold War? You seem to have been having a pretty hot
war. What the blazes have you been doing out at w_____
Brought a few people in with you, didn't you?"


I had got away to a flying start in the Refractory
Ward (which was where I found myself) by virtue of the
number of officials of various kinds I had brought in
with me; and my popularity never looked back. It was
only a matter of keen disappointment to Jock that we
never had a real ‘set to’. He could never quite comprehend
why I preferred to confine my capacities for making
trouble to the strictly non-violent sphere.


Nothing would convince me (in my deranged state of
mind) that I was not trapped. I was trapped by continental
gangsters; I was in the grip of the Communists
who had seized this outlying bastion in the centre of
England as their first victory in the Cold War. And now
I was behind the bars--the window by my bed had some
very solid bars to it--and they were going to do me in.
But it was still a battle of wits. My enemies, I knew, had
one weakness--they were bound by rules and formalities.
They too had to do the right thing. They could not kill
me in cold blood.


"Do you want some tea?" asked saturnine-looking
male nurse, West.


"No, I don't--want--tea," I replied in the deliberate
tone of talk I had adopted, "I want--bread--and wine."


West had a habit of keeping his hand inside his white
coat: I was sure that the good, harmless Mr. West, the
friendliest and the mildest soul on the ward as he turned
out to be, was concealing a stiletto in his coat. In these
circumstances my answer seemed to me to be exceptionally
clever.


"You can't kill me," I admonished him, "I have not
received the last Christian rites."


I convinced myself that I had only survived through
my religious sentiments. I was convinced too that the

[p. <i>21</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00023&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Then, at the end of two days in hospital, my period of
anxiety was over and I entered a state of revelation.
These strange things were happening to me (so it was
revealed to me) for some undisclosed, but highly important
purpose. Some powerful secret organization--
maybe it was M.I.5, maybe it was some organization
more powerful still--had taken me in here from the ken
of the world at large for some special dedicated reason.
(What a clever idea, I thought, to use a mental hospital
for this purpose!)


This explained everything. The clouds of frustration
that had for so long overhung my worldly struggles
rolled away as I entered a higher, more celestial plane
of existence. As initiation for this destiny, I was now to
be conducted on an expedition to seek guidance in the
remote, mysterious fastnesses of Central Asia and all
these other folk in the ward were my picked companions,
cleverly disguising themselves as inmates of a mental
ward. I spent my time endeavouring to penetrate
their disguises--but I never succeeded in doing so!

[p. <i>22</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00024&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

In fact, there seemed to be much delay in starting.
This, however, was accounted for by the news in the
daily papers that the Dalai Lama had been forced to
leave Lhasa by the advancing Communist armies. I was
now sure that the Dalai Lama had levitated himself
from Tibet to the remoter parts of Quebec and that the
destination of our journey was altered accordingly. But
then, disappointingly, our visit to Quebec was delayed
too--owing undoubtedly to the numerous accidents
which were taking place to our ships and aeroplanes.


However, to travel abroad was no longer necessary,
as the Grace of God was descending on me through the
early morning mist. It was an oddity of the weather of
the latter half of October, 1950, that there was a spell of
premature fine frosty weather. As I lay awake in the
early morning light, with my face up against the bars
of the window adjacent to my bed, I felt the fine cold
rain and breathed the rarified air--air such as I had
only breathed previously in my younger days at the
tops of mountains or amongst the frosts of Labrador.
("Of course, this is artificial weather," one of my ward
mates assured me a day or so later and I believed him
completely.) I was in contact with celestial forces and
my sense of destiny and dedication which had withered
within me over many years of political disappointment
welled up once again. It continued so through the day
and that same evening. As I lay awake in the dark and
looked at the clear sky between the bars of my window,
there, framed between them, was (no illusion this, but a
veritable fact) the Constellation of the Plough. I was
dreaming dreams and seeing visions, but in these dreams
and visions I knew I must set my hand to the plough once
again.


Meanwhile in the next bed to me I had discovered the
Emperor of the World. Or, at least, the curious studious-looking
little man who occupied it introduced himself
to me as such--though he was, in addition to this,

[p. <i>23</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00025&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

During the ensuing week my imaginings continued to
vary from day to day--they became, however, progressively
more grandiose. I was being groomed as understudy
to Sir Gladwyn Jebb as Britain's representative at
UNO. I was being selected as husband for Princess
Margaret and being asked to put away my own wife. I
was head of the British Commonwealth and being compelled
to make a bigamous marriage to appease my
Mohammedan subjects--for this purpose I was now
contemplating flight to the Republic of Andorra. Then
I received the happy inspiration that my dear Betty was
a descendant of the line of Plantagenet Kings through her
ancestor, the Earl of Warwick, who was, I remembered,
the last of the Plantagenets; and that I was married to
one who was a princess in her own right, working girl as
she may have been. More cogent still, I next discovered
myself a lost descendant of the Stuarts: with the help of
the tradition of my Scottish McIntosh ancestress born
at sea, my family was easily translated into an imagined
issue of Charles Stuart and Flora Macdonald. With
such credentials as these, it was not difficult in turn to
instal myself as President of the World in suitable style.


During these imaginings it seemed to me that I still
had to keep on talking, to find the right answers to the

[p. <i>24</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00026&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Throughout the night and in the hours of early
morning daylight, as I lay awake, I muttered to myself
what I considered to be the right answers. I knew that I
was under psychological observation and, as I looked
across at the lights burning all night on the opposite
side of the courtyard, I was certain that my answers were
recorded there by inquisitors who knew what I was saying
--it was with a distinct sense of disillusion that, at a later
date, I discovered that this was only a lavatory! What
was even more odd was that, as I seemed to find the right
answers to each proposition, the piece of paper resting
on the window sill would quiver, as if by a puff of wind
from some supranormal source--there would be complete
stillness when I was not talking, or when I did not
seem to be saying the right thing, followed by quivering
as soon as I found the answer.


It was at last on the Sunday subsequent to my admission
on the previous Monday that my ‘tests’ culminated
in my making perhaps the best ‘King's Speech’
that has ever been put across to a loyal and admiring
people.


A week following my admission Betty came to see me
during visiting hours. I have never been more pleased to
see anyone in my life, for simultaneously with my
illusions I had been full of very real anxiety for her. She
was, I felt, in the same dreadful dangers as I was.


However, she greeted me with her sweet and charming
smile:


"Hello, sweetheart. You're not insane."


"I know," I said, "I'm doped."


"Sh--sh. Don't say that here. They'll keep you here
for ever. And do stop talking rubbish all the time."


"I'm not talking rubbish," I said.

[p. <i>25</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00027&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

"Is there anything you want?" she asked.


"Yes," I said dramatically, "I want apples. You
must bring me apples--everyday--a fresh supply. You
must eat apples yourself and see that Norman eats
apples. Tell the family to eat apples too."


I do not normally eat apples even when they are put
in front of me. An apple a day may keep the doctor
away, but as a doctor myself I had scarcely bothered
previously to eat an apple once in six months. But
now my obsession to eat apples continued with undiminished
intensity. Betty, who came to see me daily,
would bring me 1 lb. to 1½ lbs. on each visit and I would
consume these and be ready for more the following day.
This obsession with apples continued for perhaps two
weeks, at the end of which time my appetite for
apples dropped to normal and has remained so ever
since.


In the meantime, my Jurgenesque existence of the
previous days was coming to an end and I was beginning
to relate myself to my surroundings in normal fashion.
For, with only two visits from Betty, I had grasped the
position. I had ‘corne to’ with a jolt. Not only was I
confined to hospital, so we were given to understand,
‘at the discretion of the authorities’, but as a result of
the certificate admitting me to hospital I had been
removed from control of my affairs. I was deposed from
my small empire; stripped of my position and my
authority; a patient in a public mental hospital;
treated as if I were a pauper and, indeed, an effective
pauper without a penny to my name.


For the moment, the absurdity of the situation
appealed to me so much that I laughed out loud. After
all, the whole world had been given to me in these
recent days, so what did I want with money?


Maybe, who knows, how long I might have remained
in this elevated state? But what brought me down
to earth was that Betty had no money either and was in

[p. <i>26</i>] | [<a href="psyc.get.jpg.aspx?display=page&amp;legacyid=1000048375-I00028&amp;api=new&amp;maxwidth=700">Page Image</a>]<br />

Maybe it was owing to the shock of this discovery,
maybe it was owing to the apples I was still consuming,
but my grandiose ideas slipped into the background for
consideration at some future date. My phase of visionariness
--the only phase which I have ever had in my life--
was over, not to return, I was now improving rapidly in
health day by day. I was getting out of bed and going
for walks--under properly constituted supervision, of
course. As I did so, I had ample leisure to contemplate
the fantastic mediaeval situation, projected into modern
day life, of which I was the victim. It was as if I had
fallen from the top of a high building, through one floor
after the other, until I had reached the basement where I
reposed; and I had now to essay the tedious climb
upwards.


I was only too appreciative of the fact that I was incarcerated
in hospital under mental certification as ‘a
person of unsound mind’.


However, as impressions from the outside world came
in on me, I began to put myself the simple alternative
question.


Was I mad and everybody else sane? Or was I sane
and everybody else mad?


Indeed the balance of my judgement came down some-what
heavily in favour of the latter alternative as I
contemplated the situation. My family quarrelling and
inciting litigation against each other; my hotel business
in crisis; my affairs ‘hanging fire’; myself the receptacle
of the distress of my nearest and dearest when they came

To make a slip in these circumstances was not difficult.
But I could not afford to make a slip.


No patient has surely been at any time more cooperative
than I was during the remainder of my stay at
the Hospital. Grateful and obsequious to the doctors,
and respectful of their opinions even when they were
twenty years my junior; obedient to the nurses; cooperative
with the efforts made to distract and amuse
me; I had my reward in turn in rapid promotion. First
to the much-appreciated amenity of a private room,
then to the Convalescent Ward--not nearly so amusing,
alas, as the Refractory Ward had been! In the Convalescent
Ward my latent capabilities as a Bridge player
came to my rescue in a manner which I had never
supposed possible. I did not feel like playing Bridge a
bit, but I played so enthusiastically--as I co-operated in
everything else so enthusiastically--that I won a prize.
I had only one moment of revolt--that was against the
well-meaning insistence of the charge nurse that I
should take part in occupational therapy activities--
minor carpentry and basketwork! As if I needed to
indulge myself in minor carpentry and basketwork in
order to take active interest in life with the problems that
pressed in on me! However, even this rather tricky
corner of occupational therapy was turned without real
unpleasantness.


My medical attendants in their turn viewed this
refractory patient that was myself in a new light of
approval and gratification. From the awkward customer
and prolonged mental illness that they had anticipated,
here I was cured in this remarkably short space of
time.


It was, superficially, at any rate, on the most cordial
terms with all concerned that I left the hospital six
weeks after my admission, once again in control of my

Ever since that date I have done my best to live up to
this signal distinction.
