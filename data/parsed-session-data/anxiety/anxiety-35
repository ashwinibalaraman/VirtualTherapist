The difficulty is to write clearly
about an unbelievable something
that occurred 10 years ago. It is
recalled in my mind as unrelated
images and imaginings, like a half-remembered
dream. Ten years ago,
apparently, I was out of my mind,
yet until recently I had no idea that
that was the case.


I experienced a second mental
breakdown 2 years ago, and have
since been examining my emotional
history and redefining the first
episode that occurred. The description
below is how those events
appear to me now.


It is 1979. I am almost 20 years old.
I have just left my alcoholic husband
and am driving 600 miles south to a
high-security specialized military
school. Because my husband drove
us into debt, and my military pay
records have been lost, I have no
money. One thousand miles west,
my mother is nursing my 55-year-old
grandmother, who is dying of
cancer.


During my drive, I notice that I
am "seeing" things that are not
there. Rabbits, cats, and bugs appear
and disappear. I also see people
from my past, whom I know to be
dead or hundreds of miles away,
driving the vehicles on the highway
next to me. I believe that the FBI is
following me, because I notice that
black cars with no license plates are
taking turns driving behind me.


I am not alarmed. I attribute the
sights to fatigue, and it makes sense
to me that the FBI is tailing me since
I am going to a high-security school.
When I applied for the school, the
officers told me I would be closely
watched. I am also too excited about
the new life I am entering to think
much about these events.


Once I arrive, I settle into my
room, meet my roommate, and
begin the school routine that will
soon become familiar. I learn that
much is expected of me, as I am the
only female student at the school
from my branch of the military. I do
well at the self-paced, though
rigorous program, and in my limited
spare time I write news articles for
the base publication.


After nearly a month, I become
fearful of my roommate. She seems
inhuman to me—robot-like. I notice
that many of the students are this
way. They don't seem to have

On January 6, my 20th birthday,
I complete phase I of the training.
I am moved to another building,
where I start phase II. There I meet
another student in the hallway. "You
look most attractive in your uniform,"
he says. I am intrigued by his
bold statement, and I see that he is a
tall, dark, handsome man with an
air of mystery about him.


I realize that this man is special
because he appeared on my 20th
birthday as I began phase II of my
program. It happens, in fact, that we
come to spend a lot of time together.


That night I first experience the
dream. The images, colors, and
sounds are of amazing clarity. I am
in an Egyptian temple, and before
me on a platform stands a princess
in a robe and headdress. She speaks
to me in a foreign tongue, very fast,
but I understand her meaning. She
talks to me of my special role in life.
This dream comes to me almost
every night for the next 3 months.


Some nights the princess gives me
a riddle. Today I still remember one
of them. It was: "Right to live, left to
die." I was supposed to figure out if
it meant right and left as in direction,
or if it meant right to live
versus being left to die. I pondered
the meaning of these riddles and
finally confided in my mysterious
man friend about them. He was not
surprised. In fact, he told me, he
knew about the dreams and the
princess. He told me some things
that indicated he was having similar
dreams, and then said that he felt
I was ready for new knowledge,
which he had been sent to teach me.
He was, he said, a prince, looking
for his lost kingdom. From then on,
he spoke primarily in riddles, and
told me things he had learned from
the moon.


One wonders why I didn't tell him
he was obviously on drugs or crazy.
I was confused and bewildered by
the dreams and illusions I was experiencing,
and mistrustful of this
man who said he had them too. But
I withheld judgment, tested him
with questions, and, finally
believing that he was authentic,
became something like his apprentice.
Each week we had long conversations
about things we felt were
immensely meaningful. During
these talks the prince, as I came to
think of him, would tutor and quiz
me.


Meanwhile, small events in my life
took on bigger-than-life meanings.
My roommate graduated and was
transferred out, so I had plenty of
privacy for writing long poems to
and about the prince. I spent hours
listening to particular songs over
and over, trying to decode the
messages I knew each one contained.
The line "it's all wrong, but it's
all right" seemed written for me.


A passenger pigeon nested in the
outer lobby of my room. I knew she
was sent there by the princess to
deliver a message to me. But I was
not yet knowledgeable enough to
understand the message. I saw people,
messengers the princess had
sent, disappear before my eyes. I felt
that everyone was staring at me so I
avoided populated places.


I began to think of myself as two
people. One I referred to as "she."
"She" was the Egyptian princess—a
constant voice in my head telling me
what to do to help the prince find
his kingdom. One day she told me
that I was to have a special part in
his future, and that I should brand
myself to make this clear. I used a
hot iron to burn a scar into my arm
that happened to resemble a lightning
bolt. I knew this was the right
thing to do because the burn did not
hurt. Soon after this, I became pregnant.
I told the prince, and he said
that this baby would be a king.


But now I became fearful of the
prince, seeing great anger in his
eyes on occasion and sensing in him
a ghostly monster. I remember once
I touched him and I saw my hand
go right through his arm. About
then, the prince went to his hometown
to consult with his father.
When he returned, he announced
that his father wished him to shun
me and the baby. He did not explain
why. That day I got a call saying my
grandmother had died, and against
the wishes of the prince, I got on a
plane to go to her funeral. While in
the sky, I looked out and saw the
giant head of the prince in the
clouds, forbidding me to go. Then
the captain announced that the
plane would be unable to land due
to ice formations on the Chicago
runway. I knew then that the prince
was all powerful.


I went to the officers of the school
and complained of fatigue and anxiety.
They gave me some pills that I
did not take, fearful of their effect.
Instead I talked with an officer in
charge of the newspaper I'd been
writing for, and I told him a small
part of my dilemma. He felt that I
was being drugged.


This had not occurred to me. But I
reasoned that my thinking patterns

[p. <i>167</i>]

When the dreams, hallucinations,
and messengers had gone, I was encouraged
by my officer friend to file
a complaint with security against
the prince, claiming he had drugged
me. The security officers laughed
and rolled their eyes, but took the
claim. Soon after, the prince was arrested
for selling hard drugs, and I
leamed that the security police had
been trying to catch him for some
time. My claim gave them the excuse
they needed to tail him. This
verified for me my belief that he had
been drugging me, but I dropped
my claim, afraid to have anymore to
do with him. I made a decision to
leave the service, unable to finish
the demanding course I'd started. I
suffered a very painful and terrifying
abortion. I rested a lot, and
some months later began going to
college. I wanted to forget all about
the prince and my strange troubles,
so I put the worst year of my life
behind me.


Eight years later, I found myself in
another extremely stressful situation.
I'd earned my Master's degree
in communication and had been
developing and teaching public relations
writing seminars on a national
level. By accident, I discovered my
coworkers were cheating me. I'd
recently broken an engagement to a
talented music critic I loved very
much, and I learned my stepfather
was dying of cancer.


I became quite depressed. I found
it hard to do my work, to get out of
bed, or to be with my friends. I'd
started therapy to help get me
through the ending of my engagement,
but outside events seemed to
be overwhelming. Again I "saw"
rabbits and cats, but again I attributed
it to fatigue. I didn't even
mention it to my therapist.


Then, while home alone during a
3-day snowstorm, I slowly receded
from the outside world and was
drawn inside to a place of many
voices. A constant blur of conversation
ran in the background, as if I
were in a busy restaurant or airport.
In the foreground, two or three
voices argued, sang, rhymed words,
and spoke nonsense.


Looking around my room, I found
that things had lost their emotional
meaning. They were larger than life,
tense, and suspenseful. They were
flat, and colored as if in artificial
light. I felt my body to be first giant,
then miniscule. My arms seemed to
be several inches longer than before
and did not feel as though they
belonged to me.


This time, though, I had help. I
reached up and up the wall to a tiny
little phone, dialed my therapist's
number, and told him what was
happening. He arranged for me to
see a psychopharmacologist. This
doctor took my history, explained
that I was experiencing an imbalance
of brain chemicals, and put
me on medication.


That was 2 1/2 years ago. Since
then, I have remained on medication.
First Haldol, but I gained too
much weight, so we tried Moban.
Now my symptoms vary in kind and
intensity, but I am able to perform
my job. I no longer travel or do
much teaching, since I need abundant
rest, but I am able to relate to
my coworkers and do my work as a
newsletter writer.


Some of my friends stopped
speaking to me after the breakdown.
A few have stuck with me and have
been incredibly supportive. I have
altered my lifestyle drastically to
allow for therapy twice a week, a lot
of rest, careful eating habits, and
avoidance of crowded or loud
places. My work ambitions are considerably
different (once I would
have said "lowered," but I no longer
think of it that way). I have slowed
myself down considerably, and
changed my values so that relationships
have become very important. I
am also a more actively compassionate
person. I attend 12-step
meetings regularly for support and
guidance, and I have learned how to
avoid worsening my symptoms.


Becoming too cold, too hot, tired,
or overwhelmed by noise or crowds
will bring on symptoms such as
elongated arms and unclear thinking,
"seeing" little animals, or a
sense that my head is full of cotton.
This happens also if I work hard at a
steady pace without rest or adequate
food. The emotional stress of
therapy will sometimes cause me to
"go away" (or dissociate) as will
other types of emotional trauma.


Every so often I decide to go off
my medication. I realize from experience
that this makes no sense,
but it seems I have to try it now and
then. Within from 2 days to 1 week,
the symptoms return or intensify.
This is painful and scary so I go
back on. Then it takes me from 1 to
3 weeks to get back onto an even
keel. While this is a negative experience,
it is my way of testing the
possibility that I am well. I have
trouble accepting that my illness is
long-term. I keep thinking I will

[p. <i>168</i>]

I am coming to believe that the
best way to accept my illness is to
make it useful. To do that, I am
cautiously sharing information
about it with others. I am writing
letters to people whom I see promoting
the stigma of the mentally
ill, and I am writing stories about
myself and others who are ill to help
educate the mentally well. I would
like them to understand what it feels
like, and I would like to clarify for
myself, through my writing, that
this illness is really happening to
me. I also benefit greatly from
reading what other ill people write,
so I hope that I say something that
helps someone else.


Recently I told my mother of my
illness. She said, "Well, it's the
furthest thing I would have ever imagined
for you." I recognize in her
words disappointment and sadness.
And I hear my own silent echo of
those words. It is the furthest thing,
I think, that any of us imagine for
ourselves.
